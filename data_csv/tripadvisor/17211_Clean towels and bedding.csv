Does this continue to be a problem at most resorts
Ummmm YES! Best to stay clear of Cuba.... sightings of dirty towels and bedding have now grown to epidemic proportions. It's all very scary. Terry
"I've been twice to Cuba, most recently as January, and both times in Melia resorts. I've never ever had an issue with this."
A doctor I work with went to Grand Memories in Jan/Feb and had a clean towel issue.
"Post 3.sorry but why state a docter, is that supposed to make the issue worse?I went with a dog walker and not an issue.I also went with someone who has ocd and again no issue."
"I heard from a friend that his cousin's sister's boyfriend's brother once spotted a clean towel in Cuba... but apparently he was very drunk at the time, so couldn't be absolutely sure about that. Be very afraid. Terry"
"Sorry children, I should have said aquaintance, co worker, somebody I know..... I know them as Dr X so it's habit. Oh my!"
"Ok. Thank you. The last couple of times we were advised upon checking in there would be no clean towels until the following week due to laundry being done offsite and with new resorts opening, the laundry facility could not supply the demand. Thank you for your replies."
"If you are concerned about it, maybe just pack a beach towel in your suitcase in case you need it? That is what I would probably do if the reviews on my resort were constantly mentioning issues with getting a clean towel."
The bed sheets were clean at Brisas Guardalavaca last week. I brought my own towel as I didn't want to lose the resort's towel and risk having to pay the 40 CUCs replacement fee.The sheets are usually alright in the 4 and 5 star hotels.
"Been to Cuba many times, a couple of years ago at Cayo Libertad, Varadero, had to track down the cleaning staff for towels, and received what I wanted, so, no problem."
It depends probably which resort but I sure can tell you my friend wife who is a maid in Varadero says that it's the same old problem which is not enough towels for everyone in alot of resorts .
"Depends where you are going.....only place we have ever had any problems are on Cayo Coco ( and only at one resort there) We always take our own beach towels (old, colourful and easy to 'spot' ),..... just seems easier somehow !! Never had a problem with clean bedding, or towels in the bathroom ( with that one aforementioned exception), and we almost always stay at 2* and 3*, older resorts.Barb"
"Our last three visits have been to Iberostar Tainos and never had an issue with dirty bed sheets or towels. However, the onus is on you to go and change your towel each day."
Post 13.You do mean onus on changing beach towel each day I take it ?The maids do the rooms.
Yes I mean Beach towel
"Clean towels and beddingDoes this continue to be a problem at most resortsYes, last time I went there was a problem. All our bedding & towels were clean & regularly changed.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Well it seems to me , the beach towel problem is that a lot of people want a nice new clean towel EVERYDAY .. Can you imagine washing all your towels everyday and trying to keep up . Why can't people hold onto there towels for at least a few days or a week before expecting a clean one . And I guess that could go for room towels also . Not every room towel needs to be replaced everyday .Johnny CEdited: 3 years ago "
been a few times and take our own wash cloths (.50 at dollar store) and a couple of cheap towels.. they dry faster
Never an issue. I always bring my own towel. I'm more relaxed each time I go.
Laurie m can you tell me how you found the hotel you mentioned I'm going in 2 weeks.
"Beach towels can be a problem. The last resort I stayed in April was only 4 days a week for beach towel service. I just bring one from home. Just bought a cheerful new one for $4 at Giant Tiger. Saves hassle last day of returning towel and probably getting deposit back from desk as well. Never had a problem with room towels or linens. Occasional stain or frayed, but clean and replaced daily."
"I take along two of my own beach towels (for easy recognition ) so any supply problem in that area generally doesn't affect me.After years of vacationing at this one resort, last year I had the following problem:I try to have my bath towels last at lest a couple of days, I put them back on the towel rack as a sign that they are still in use, after a two or three days I will place the soiled towel on the floor of the bath tub so it can be replaced with a new on. well one particular day while eating a mango the juice started running down my arm, so I grabbed the towel I had sitting in the bath tub to clean my arm up, then tossed it back in the tub. Low and behold, the next time I grabbed for that nice clean towel folded and sitting on the towel rack, it turned out to be 'my old mango stained towel. It would appear all the maids do is refold your used towels and put them back on the rack... Ever since then, whenever I wanted my towels changed.. I made sure to leave the maid a 'soaking wet' used towel..sorry, but I don't think a clean towel every two or three days is too much to expect.Oh, and whenever I travel with my grand children.. I bring along their own linens (towels, pillow slips and 'top sheet)..but that's just a hypersensitive grandmother, besides with their individual luggage allowance, there is loads of room for the little extras."
"I always bring facecloths as I don't ever remember a week anywhere in Cuba where I had facecloths provided every day.Other than that...I haven't had an issue with bedsheets or towels etc and have stayed many different places. Then again, I haven't looked real close either."
It always amazes me why people do expect a face flannel be provided.
"18) That's what I do, go to the dollar store and buy washcloths, take a few with me every time."
"On a slightly different topic, I would recommend taking a couple of those flat all-purpose rubber bath plugs....we have needed them on several occasions. And yes, definitely facecloths.....as diva says, I have never expected to have them provided, and prefer to use my own, anyway !Barb"
We also take a flat multi funtional plug.Wokes better even if plug is in sink.
"Barb, rubber bath plug, good idea. I have to watch it, sometimes I take too much, you would think I'm moving in."
Then I guess I'm an unlucky person as the resort i have been to Varadero I had my room towels changed about 3 times out of 2 weeks .I think some of you should look at your towels closer because I know in Varadero there is a big problem with towels and that is not coming from me but from a friend who is a maid as she says some days she has about 10 towels for 12 rooms guess we're the rest comes from lol.As for beach towel I hit the jackpot we got to change one on a 2 week vacation because the other 13 days there was none ..
"#24it amazes you why I would expect a face cloth?well here in Canada it is common for people to wash their faces.......and a facecloth is made for thatSorry I have such high expectations for washing my face.This is a standard item in any hotel in Canada, United states, Dominican, Bahamas based on my travels so far."
"Thank you Monctonguy for your polite response. To the original poster, please know your question is legitimate. As Gato explained it really does depend on availability of all towels being transported and washed daily. I always bring an extra beach towel as there can be periods of time when they are not available."
Postv30.A face flannel is a personal item.Take one or 5 of tgem.They are pennies.I know a towel is supplied but a flannel is more personal.I mean were the flannel goes and you want to have a hotel supply.Each to their own.
"If you want to bring your faceclothes home I suggest bring a coloured one. Often maids will take white ones thinking they belong to the hotel. I always bring a few of my own. I pack them in the outside pocket of my suitcase so I can easily find them if needed. Faceclothes are a North American thing so that is why they are scarce in Southern climes. I also bring tea bags, ketchup packets and peanut butter!"
Face flannels are used all over the world.
Face clothes only place I never saw one is in Cuba because in DR Mexico and Jamaica they sure have them at resorts we have been to so I guess it's not only a North America thing ...
#34So you state they are used all over the world BUT it amazes you why I would expect one while in Cuba for a week?I don't follow your logic at all.
"I have not said I expect one in Cuba.One of the hotels I use does supply them but I take my own.As a fact I have not said they are used all over the world in hotels, I said they are used.Edited: 3 years ago "
"We went to DR last year and they had face cloths in the room, but as usual I had some with me.....but the funny thing is, we went to a B&B in Ontario this summer and they never had any in the room, and of course never thought I would need to bring any....thought this was odd."
"We always bring a few as well but I have to say, I was surprised not to find any when I was in Cuba. I don't think the locals use them. I always buy a few cheap ones and leave them with friends."
"#37...your replies don't even make sense.....or follow any logic even to comments you make about your own previous statements......I never said that you said that you expect one in Cuba..so why would you even state that?Then you state:As a fact I have not said they are used all over the world in hotels, I said they are used. ??????!!!!That makes no sense either......nothing you have contributed to this topic makes any sense at all. Neither statements nor replies you are making.Anyways....it IS a fact that most resorts in Cuba do not give facecloths daily so for those of us who are used to it in other countries and hotels we have stayed at and like to use a facecloth to wash our face(hence the name FACEcloth), its a great tip for someone asking or wondering about it.I hope you don't post anything else now about this as it will just be more confusing for anyone reading this thread."
"It all boils down to.....they do not use face cloths in Cuba, pack some for your own use, that simple."
#41 How rude. Maybe you should take your own advise and not post. Too many people on this forum think they know everything when they know nothing.Thanks Barb for sensible information.Face cloths or flannels as they are also know are used all over the world but are not supplied by all hotels. Far more hygienic to bring your own anyway.
"I know it's silly to go on about this, but I don't call them facecloths, but washcloths, because I wash my face with them and just keep going.....I know too much info, that's why I always take my own, a pack from the dollar store."
I like to drip dry
"Ron, you like to drip dry.....so does that mean you don't need any towels."
#43Sorry....been to Cuba 9 times so I speak to experience on this topic.I don't think nor imply I know everything.On this topic though.my experience is valid and contributes to this conversation.Thanks.
"I don't know about anyone else, but I am feeling that the whole topic of face/wash/whatever cloths has been exhausted LOL !! ;-), but maybe that's just me !! Please don't hold back if you feel you have more to add....it's ALMOST Friday !!Barb"
Where ya been Barb . Missed ya lately Johnny C
Barb: you are Trip Advisor most respected member !!! Your calm and non-judgmental postings (even though some are funny) are always missed. I'll bet you took your grandson shopping for new school clothes. And then you signed up for a quick trip to Cuba.
"Your right Barb......I think this has been stretched way too far, time to put this baby to bed."
Bed already ???? But I havnt found a face flannel to wash my face with yet before bed . Johnny C

"Oh Johnny C...you always make me laugh !! Thanks for the kind words , sund0g.....you are right on ALL counts ! Lots of ''back to school shopping for all four of the school age grandkids, AND a trip that is almost booked for next week, for my sister and myself. Not quite sure where we are going yet, but will have to decide within the next couple of days. Keep you posted !!Barb"
"WASH CLOTHS..WHY I NEED THEM IN CUBA: While there I am constantly 'lathering myself with either sunscreen in the day..or spray on repellent in the evening.A washcloth (lathered in bath jell) is a great device for removing said substances when I take those quick before bed showers, my feeling is, it is not in my best health interest to sleep with the residue of those 'chemicals' on me anymore than it is for me to sleep with the residue of makeup on my face when I am at home (when I wear it).Yes, I take my own washcloths to Cuba.. no biggie."
"I can live with no replacement beach towels ... (just hang them outside) and maybe no bath towels for 2-3 days, but I would find dirty bed linen intolerable. This was an issue by some other couples at Paradisus R&S, where they found stains and soiling in a fresh made bed.Just Saying"
"Maybe the maid left them a ""gift"" because they hadn't left a big enough tip."
"I don't think they're that spiteful, but it's a concern and you have to wonder how they're managing this apparent shortage !!"
Been a couple of times when the hotel was full (Blau Varadero) and had no issues with either towels or bed linen with both being changed daily.The did run out of mint for the Mojitos one evening though...now that IS serious!!P.S. CrazyCanuk - I heard rumors of rogue towels hiding in the bushes and attacking animals an un- accompanied children so be afraid - be VERY afraid!Edited: 3 years ago 
""", because I wash my face with them and just keep going.....I know too much info""Yes, as do many other people.And that my friends is one of the best reasons to bring your own face cloths (unless you really believe Cuba uses hot water and lots of detergent in their washers)."
