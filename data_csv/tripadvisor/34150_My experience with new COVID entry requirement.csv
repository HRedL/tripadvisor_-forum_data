"Wanted to share our experience entering Alaska yesterday, the first day of the new entry requirements. No one said a word about it at Alaska Airlines when we were checking in or boarding. Upon final approach when they tell you to get ready for landing, they announced the requirements. So some people may have been caught off-guard if they hadn’t been paying attention on their own before their trip. Side note: Alaska Air did leave all middle seats empty on the flight and required all passengers to wear masks. We deplaned and they funneled everyone into a long line. They had Declaration Forms to fill out. Oddly, no social distancing was being done or even encouraged in this line. No markings on the floor, no staff encouraging it. Very ironic. A long table of staff in PPE awaited us once we got through the line. They asked to see our COVID test results and the declaration form and our ID. We gave them the documents. They asked where we would be staying and we told them all over in an RV. They offered us vouchers for a follow up test and said they encourage it. It was not presented as mandatory but as encouraged. People who did not have the required COVID tests were then sent downstairs to a line to get tested. The rest of us were then allowed to go collect our luggage and leave. Hope this helps!"
Interesting.It’s been a few days of beautiful weather. Hopefully it will continue.
How soon did you get your test results before you boarded for Alaska?
"Shelly, 2 of us got them from Walgreens on Wednesday. Walgreens wouldn’t test minors my daughter had to get tested at an actual hospital on Wed. We got those results on Thurs. our departure time was 7:00am Sat."
"Thank you for your first person account, Ferg, and I’m almost as excited for you, as I would be for myself, but all my fun will be Alaska fun for quite awhile. And that’s just fine with me! Especially since the weather has been amazing, and we have our own peace of paradise. You have a blast with your family up here, and thank you also for being caring visitors. I hope you will trip report your fun, ONLY when you have time. I used to waste my Maui time writing trip report blogs, and in hindsight, I could have gotten more sleep! ENJOY! Deb"
"Have fun Ferg....Couple of questions:1. What time did your flight land? (Just want to see if tests are available at all times at airport, just in case we don’t get in NY)2. Would you say majority of passengers had test results with them?3. Any idea what kind of a test was administered at airport? 5 minute test I guess...Keep us posted ...have fun"
"Anchorage...- even though ANC is discouraging the traveler; if you have to have a meal in ANC, Moose’s Tooth is great and does a great job with their current ‘to go’ process. They have been very busy so count on a wait for orders."
Thank you Ferg.....this is very helpful to travelers.....glad to hear that it is all so organized.......
"Thank you, Deb! I won’t do a trip report until we get back. Just no time as so much to experience! But I will try and help answer questions on this thread as able to help people with pressing questions. Scott — Mooses Tooth is on the list!Shelby — sorry I called you Shelly. darawula — I don’t know about the testing. I only saw the people in the line but kind of kept my distance just in case and did not approach them to ask anything. There was a good number in that line but I don’t know they were all passengers. They said we could come back to the airport with our vouchers for the Re-test if we wanted or use other places around the state. So I don’t know if that is just travelers in that line or if general public can go in that line too. We landed at 5:30pm."
"I downloaded the declaration form. The other option is to self quarantine in leu of the test. From what I read, it's on the honorary system, and not being enforced."
"If you choose not to be honorable, the CDC will be happy to find you, if necessary. So unless you plan to follow the rules, stay home. Thank you. Deb"

I thought Walgreens did the ID Now test not the PCR test?
Thanks so much for sharing Ferg. Very helpful! Have a great trip!
I appreciate this post as I have family returning to their home here in about a week. They are likely electing to quarantine rather than test & are able to do so at their home. Did you happen to notice what the procedure was for those electing to quarantine ? It there a 3rd line? I’m just trying to help them know what to expect upon landing. Thanks for the help! Hope you have a great trip here!
"JLH090 — I think it was all the same line. They go over the declaration form at that long table that everyone went to. That said, I was there on the first day and they may tweak their process by the time your family comes through."
"Trektheusa — a few Walgreens do the test, not all of them. So you have to check. The local Walgreens Pharmacy will probably tell you which one or two stores in your area offer it."
Thank you so much for your quick reply Ferg! I hope this weather continues and you have wonderful time. I really appreciate your help!
"I flew from Anchorage to Fairbanks today. At the bottom of the escalators and before baggage claim, one is met by several enthusiastic masked young people, each sporting a bottle of hand sanitizer and a stamp. If one lives in Alaska and did not come from outside the state, one gets a hand stamp which lets one bypass the meet and greet tables. If one is transited through the Anchorage airport to my flight from out of state, one got pointed to one of the tables to complete a declaration form and show ID, after collecting luggage. There was a health screening area set up beyond the tables. Right behind me came a flight from Seattle. EVERYONE got directed to the tables and no stamps were applied. Be aware the stamp ink is fairly water soluble. I picked up my rental car keys, washed my hands in the restroom, and then exited baggage claim and almost wasn’t believed when I displayed my bery faded hand stamp. I left from Anchorage. I had ZERO wait there for my mid afternoon flight. There are signs directing people to the screening area UNLESS departing Alaska or arriving from within Alaska. The signs reference the website www.covid19.alaska.gov."
Ferg Thanks. It's good to know they get the results faster than other places I've looked into
"I am planning to do the same, Walgreens on Wednesday and arrive on Anchorage (and another flight to Fairbanks) on Saturday. DId Walgreens email you the results or did you have to pick them up ? I see they have a 24 hours turnaround, what that your experience ?"
"Hi Ferg, thank so much for sharing your experience. When you have a moment, I wanted to ask if they needed a printed out piece of paper of your result or if showing them an email or a patient portal will suffice. Hoping I dont need to make two trips, one to get tested and one to get a paper result."
"If you look at the sign that I saw somewhere that was in the ANC airport, it shows that you need printed paperwork of the test result."
"Garfield...- that's a good/interesting question. I looked hard through the state's Mandate #10 'stuff' and could not find anything more solid than:--- ""present results upon arrival."" and --- ""evidence of the results can be provided.""I think it could be looked at either way.When this comes up I'd 'rather be safe than sorry'. I wouldn't trust calling someone at some office and getting their opinion (after all it is government). If I was in your situation I'd carry a paper copy and then you know you are ok. Good luck"
"Thanks! I will plan on having a paper copy with me, rather be safe than sorry like you said :)Edited: 4:22 pm, June 08, 2020 "
Thank you it does help with our planning. I am Hoping we can get tested here to still go in August. Have fun!!
So I'm thinking of flying to Kodiak from the mainland. Is the COVID screening in Anchorage before transiting to my Kodiak flight? Or do I transit to Kodiak and get screened there?
I presume you'll be screened in Kodiak. You are screened at the airport you exit
"Hubby & I have been arguing for two days now about ""what if you get the test 5 days prior"" because the FAQ states you need to have another test in Alaska but will not be quarantined until the test results are available . . . but the declaration form you complete for your arrival states you will be quarantined until your second test result is received.At this point, it's enough hassle and BS with mis-information, that's he's questioning whether to make this trip next month or not.I keep hoping it will all be OK and that (1) we'll find the PCR test local and can have it done on a Wednesday with results before our flight on Saturday; and (2) *IF* we have to do the test five day's prior (Monday) we won't have to quarantine upon arrival, as we wait (in Denali NP) for our results . . . which means technically we won't get them until we get out of Denali the following Friday (six days after our arrival to AK)."
"My wife and I are flying into Anchorage next month on a Friday. We are meeting with our Dr. the Monday before who will authorize the test. We will then have the test done on Tuesday which the results will not be available until 48 hours after. Once we get the results, we will have our paperwork. AK mandates the test cannot be any earlier than 72 hours. It's a pain, but at least we will be able to run around without being questioned. Our Dr. knew exactly what to do since hes getting several patients flying to AK. Hope this helps!"
"@fiveupstone""Testing is currently available in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Wrangell, Sitka, Gustavus and Ketchikan airports for general travelers"""
"Timeshare..... they keep calling the 7-14 day test the ""second test"" when sometimes it's the third.""Tested within 5 days of departure: test again immediately upon arrival. If you don't have your first results yet, you will have to quarantine until you receive them. Once you receive negative results from the pre-travel test, minimize interactions until you receive an additional (third) negative test within 7-14 days of arrival."""
Screening for Kodiak will happen in Anchorage upon arrival between plane changes. This avoids one ending up two plane flights away from home if there is an issue.
"TimeshareVon- this 3 day vs 5 day was super confusing to me too as I’m trying to figure out the best plan for my family returning home. There was a Q & A w/DHSS that helped me: If your negative test is more than 72 hours old, you are tested at the airport again & asked to minimize contact w/others until those results come in (not quarantine).If you haven’t been tested before so the airport test is your first test you are asked to quarantine until the results are in. If your test is within 72 hours you don’t get a 2nd test at the airport but are given the voucher to test again at some point but you don’t have to get it at the airport on arrival.At least that’s the way it was explained in the Q & A.I get the point of all this but it is definitely confusing .Edited: 1:40 pm, June 10, 2020 "
FYI.....Debhttps://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Over-2000-…My
@36 - Those are some interesting numbers. At least I won't feel terrible if I come without a test but I'm certainly going to try and get one before.
"I too have read the FAQ as you interpret it. The confusion, and source of irritation with my husband is that on the arrival declaration it clearly states under option #4 that ""I agree to quarantine at the listed location until I receive the results of my test."""
I would really recommend anyone with questions to email covidquestions@alaska.gov I emailed a specific question about at home testing kits and the 72 hour window and received an immediate automated reply with the mandate spelled out much more clearly than the actual website. I also received a personal reply from a real person answering my specific question within an hour.They are answering questions and doing it quickly and it will really help with the confusion many of us are experiencing. Hope that helps!
"@ deb - yeah, I read that too. I'm hoping for the best but I'll be prepared for the worstEdited: 5:36 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"Safe travels trek....that’s the best plan, for most everything up here! Deb"
@ Deb Thanks! Be up soon!
Glad your experience was great. We had to cancel our July trip. There are too many unknowns and wasn't sure if we could get results on time. Cutting it close. And they can't guarantee they will have enough tests when arrive. We didnt want to lose a couple days quarantining if for some reason we didn't get test before we left. This just sucks but we are going to try to go to Colorado now
"Yes Deb, I think the state has done a remarkable job during this situation.......Even in you small, semi remote town, we have the rapid test available and I think the 14 day quarantine however inconvenient really kept the number of cases lower......We as Alaskans also need to continue being vigilant as well.....Here are a few suggestions I have based on my observations of locals in our town:1. When you wear a mask, cover both your nose and mouth.....many leave their nose uncovered - why bother wearing one at all2. Don't stand in front of a building entrance or check out stand gabbing with your friends.....be aware of the need of others to come and go using social distancing.....3. No need to wear a mask while driving if you are the only one in the car.....silly, but I see it every day.......Many elderly people seem to be the most respectful and careful.....just wish the younger ones would keep them in mind......"
"So sad we had to cancel our trip for next month. My state only offers immediate testing to non-symptomatic people in the hardest hit areas, which are three hours from me. Some of our tour operators canceled for the season also, so we figured it best to try next year. Just wanted to thank everyone on this forum for the help, if I hadn’t checked in here I wouldn’t have been nearly as informed as I was about everything. Y’all seem like some of the nicest people and I can’t wait to try again next year!"
"Melissa....I hope you get the BEST time up here possible next year! I know how hard it is to cancel, cause I had to cancel four Maui vacations, last chances with my mom, in a very special state to our family. I’m changing my tune on planning future itineraries, too, cause laying the groundwork is smart. Hope most businesses are in play again next year. Get that countdown started, cause time really flies, and you’re going to be here before you know it. Deb"
Thanks for posting. I was surprised they were lax in social distancing!
"Lax in social distancing...Since mid-March I’ve restricted myself to:- home & no guests. Chat with neighbors over our decks/fences - Costco, H.Depot, recycle depot, & gas station - masks & excellent social distancing.- recently expanded to Fred Meyers - good social distancing- our cabin in Caswell Lakes (completely private)- my first trip other than above was to Long Branch Saloon for lunch/burger the other day. IMO it was a disaster. I left after a few minutes as tables very near us filled up and no one was practicing social distancing - UNCOMFORTABLE. The bar/restaurant was as busy as I have ever seen it, and only three people were were wearing masks (i couldn’t see kitchen): one server was wearing a mask, and myself and my guest."
"So helpful, thank you, was planning an RV trip!"
"Just reading comments on ADN's Facebook posts I am not at all surprised that many Alaskans have no desire to socially distance or wear masks. Seems very similar to most other states from what I have read. ""I do me and don't tell me what to do"" seems like a very prevalent attitude throughout the USA these days. Unfortunate that there is little respect for others, as Scott has experienced recently."
"Yes John, when in public you need to take your own responsibility to either back away from others or leave the premises if people are not socially distancing......so many selfish people, sad times indeed"
"Fti....your location says Alaska. What are you observing, where YOU are in Alaska? I’ve shared my observations, in both Anchorage and Willow. People will do as they please, whether mandated or not. I imagine it isn’t just like that in Alaska, but everywhere in the USA. I’ve only been in AK lately. I choose the personal responsibility measures, being suggested, but I have very good reason to do so. Others think this is funny. Then there’s the folks in the middle. Everybody’s their own person, and I just hope enough choose wisely, for a healthier AK future. DebEdited: 2:18 pm, June 14, 2020 "
"@post 51...Scott..there are videos of Vegas opening last week and the videos are shocking. Casino employees all have masks, but about 80-90% of people walking in don’t have masks. It’s amazing...almost like 6 months ago...Some people just don’t care and can’t be bothered.,"
"short article on arriving at ANC...see: https:/…I've sent a question to the reporter/author asking if they had any indication on how long test results, for ANC testing, were taking to coma back."
"In the FAQ section under the declaration form I read that they will except emails, patient portals and printed results."
Great that your Dr will order the test. Mine said she could not order it for travel. So I will have to find somewhere else.
"The reporter/author of the article I linked below (#57) told me the ""airport testing"" results are taking 3 to 5 days."
"Freg, how long did it take to get your results from Walgreens? How did they send you your results, phone call, email, or some other method? Thanks for the info it is very helpful for planning our trip!"
... and the airport initiated test results are not quick (3-5 days & longer!) article: https:/…
"I have read it multiple time and in multiple places, the state requirement for the test is 72 hours prior to DEPARTURE, and not ARRIVAL? This is important for us as we will be in transit for multiple hours coming from the east coast. Just want to make sure I am correct and not loosing my mind reading all of the information online. Thank you.Edited: 10:33 pm, June 17, 2020 "
"Also, we have a connection, so I assume the 72 hours clock start with my flight from home, and not my connecting flight into Alaska? I obviously cannot get tested while in transit."
"Within 72 hrs prior to departure.Q: I can’t get a test result within 72 hours of departure. What are my options?A: Getting a PCR test within 72 hours prior to departure and showing that negative result is the fastest and safest way to ensure your ability to explore Alaska right away. If your test results aren’t in before you depart, you can quarantine at arrival until the results arrive. Once you provide the results to the state, your quarantine is over.…alaska.gov/dph/…"
Thank you. Any thoughts on the connecting flight making a difference with the 72 hour requirement?
"To me, before you depart means when you start your transit ie when you board your first flight. But, this level of specificity will probably require an answer from the state. I would email them."
"Regarding the 72 hours prior to departure . . . this was my experience (thus far) in trying to get clarification:We too are scrambling with the pre-arrival testing. I've tried to get information for the DHS in Anchorage . . . and have been given misinformation or conflicting information twice already. I want to do what is required, but questions as simple as ""is the requirement 72 hours before getting on a flight TO Alaska or is it 72 hours getting on the first flight from home enroute to Alaska"" has garnered varying responses from Alaskan officials.In our case, it makes the difference of about 9 hours, which is essentially a full day . . . can we test on Wednesday prior to departure . . . or must it be Thursday . . . to meet the 72 hour requirement? The interpretation matters.In our case, we'll probably have to go with the 5 days in advance by default, because I don't see us getting the test on Thursday morning, and having the result in hand by the time we depart."
"Thank you. I just got a response from them indicating it was ""72 hours prior to ARRIVAL to Alaska"" which is completely wrong. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on the information being provided through the email address."
"Alexander, who did you e-mail? Have you tried e-mailing Gov. Dunleavy directly: https://gov.alaska.gov/ . Let him know the variety of answers you and Von have received."
I email traveler@alaska.gov. This is their advertised resource for getting questions answered. I have also email the governor per your suggestion. Stay tuned! Thank you!
"Our returning family came through ANC today and the entry checkpoint is moving smoothly and apparently everyone is quite friendly & helpful. One thing to note- apparently each person needs to register online under a separate email. Since they are one family unit, they had used the same email to register two people (filled out 2 separate forms but same email) The worker had to re-register one of them under another email. The worker commented that the state needs to make people aware of this because they have to re-register anyone coming through if there’s more than one person per email. I have no idea why this matters, but thought I’d share that little tip and reassure people that things seem to be moving smoothly & fairly quickly!"
"Do you know if the email issue applies to kids? We hope to travel in July with my 6&8 yo kids, they do not have email."
The online declaration form allows you to include minors on the parent form so I'd assume they don't have to use a separate email.
Thanks for the info about the two email addresses. I will make sure I do that. Was your family tested before they arrived or tested at the airport?
"I got a response from the state (traveler@alaska.gov) clarifying that ""72 hours before departure"" means 72 hours from departure from home, not your last connecting flight into Alaska."
Alexander thanks for that info. Honestly I am a bit surprised with that. Some people could be traveling for up to a day (or more if coming from overseas which at this point is highly unlikely).
"The two email issue only seems to apply for adults because there are actually separate forms submitted - the system doesn’t like having more than one form associated with one email address. Since minors are declared on an adult form, it shouldn’t be an issue."
"Thanks Alexander! I'm going to write them myself, so I have something in writing. Our travel plans provide a long travel day (15 hours from home to arrival in AK . . . and 11 hours difference in departure times from home vs. final flight into AK)."
"I understand all the requirements to enter Alaska, well kind of........my question is - is anyone looking into requirements for getting back to their home state? I just thought of this and will have to research NY re-entry requirements..."
"NY doesn’t have any now, but they wanted to quarantine ppl coming from hot spots like Texas, Florida."
"Daruwla...- good question & these state to state travel situations could change too.Edited: 10:31 am, June 22, 2020 "
"Scott and Runnermom...these state to state requirements keep changing according to hot spots. Travel from FL to NY will definitely get tougher. So hypothetical follow up question: let’s say after our Alaska trip, NY has a restriction in place (something similar to what Alaska has now). Now, if we cannot get a test in Alaska before departing, do we have to self-quarantine at home for 14 days? I guess..."
"Daruwala...NY (or anyone's home state) might not CARE if you provide a negative test, which are notoriously unreliable due to their high false negative rate. So I expect if NY mandates a 14 day quarantine you'd have to stay home for 14 days regardless of testing....Here in Manitoba we have had a 14 day quarantine for all but essential travel into the province until yesterday, when Phase 3 now opens up interprovincial travel between Manitoba and western provinces to west of Terrace Bay in Ontario. Those no longer require any self-isolation period. People arriving from other places still have to quarantine for 14 days whether or not they have been tested negative."
"RE: My post #80I did write to the address someone provided to seek more precise information as to when our pre-arrival testing must be done based on our travel itinerary (specific times). What I got was really just a general response . . . BUT it did clarify that the 72 hour and 5 day time window is based on ARRIVAL time in Alaska (and not departure time from home or the final flight into AK) . . .""You will need to have a negative test within 72 hours or 5 days of arrival in Alaska."" This was from someone who identified themselves with a job title of ""Port of Entry Coordinator"" so I'm going to go with their response in terms of when we test here in Wisconsin.As a separate issue . . . we have found that our medical system (Froedtert) will do the PCR testing with next day results. Because we are asymptomatic, it requires our PCP to put in the order . . . which he did yesterday. So we ""should be"" good to go with test results in hand from 72 hour prior to arrival test. (Assuming we're both negative!)"
Ugh re. arrival vs. departure! All the written documentation says departure including multiple times on the declaration form - https://covid19.alaska.gov/wp-content/upload… I really hope they go with that.We got tested yesterday afternoon for a Thursday afternoon departure so I'll let you know if they make us test again at the airport or if we get credit for 72 hours and bypass airport testing. We have a twelve hour travel day so by the time we arrive we will be at 81 hours since being tested.
This is so frustrating. Everything I have read says within “72 hours of departure”. This is so important with travel time and time change involved. Would hate for them to not accept test results because of this. I’m thinking it might be safer to go with what’s in writing?
Anne S let us know what happens when you arrive. Did you get your test results back already?
"No kidding it's frustrating. Hard to believe that weeks later there is still confusion. As usual with a government, the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing....In addition to Anne's link (which is the declaration visitors must SIGN as an official document), government websites also state 72 hours BEFORE DEPARTURE.

Will let you know how it goes for us! No results on tests yet. Lab said 24-48 hours so I'm hoping to know something tomorrow morning.
"Anne, could you also ask the airport medical personnel for clarification? Explain to them the differing information some folks have been given from official sources. Since they're the ones enforcing the rules, hopefully they will all be on the same page...."
We've decided to schedule our testing for Thursday 7/9 as we were told they are 12-24 hours (max) in returning results electronically via MyCHART where w can print the documentation necessary upon arrival. Fingers crossed . . . and hope others are going to be OK with their window of testing too.
TimeShareVon - Where are you getting your test done? This sounds like a good option. Quick turn around and online results.
"I'll see what more info I can get Thursday and share. We all tested negative. Tested yesterday afternoon at 3:30 and results back at 10:30 this morning. After getting lots of 3-5 day estimates on turnaround, this was a very nice surprise!"
"Anne S where did you get tested with the fast results? My trip is not until September, but I am interested since I am in Georgia as well."
Luvvacation58 we're scheduled to have ours done with our healthcare provider network . . . Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin. It required us having an order from our PCP since we are asymptomatic.
"We used a local family practitioner. They typically refer out COVID tests but I work with them professionally and after getting 3-5 day projections from all the places locally advertising COVID testing, I reached out and asked if they had a recommendation. They called their lab who said they could do a 24-48 hour turnaround and so they said they'd take care of it for us. I think of note is that it is a sole practitioner not affiliated with any of the big medical groups so they have more flexibility to agree to test. Our pediatrician, who is with a big group, could not do it."
Anne I'm so happy that it worked out for you!
"@oldmama54, I am in Alpharetta Ga and the Walgreens up here is advertising 24 hour turnaround tests. (supposedly the only one in GA) Currently there are no appointments for the next week which I find odd but when its time for me to book one in August I will make it as far in advance as i canhttps:/…testing"
"Warning for people coming from the Seattle area. I used the new testing sites that the city of Seattle has set up in the old Emissions testing sites. The whole experience was quick and wonderful and free, HOWEVER...I had my test done at 4pm and my results came back that I took the test at 9am. Totally messing up the 72 hour time frame as I arrive in the afternoon. So I think they set up the testing info for the day to all reflect 9am when the day's testing begins. The results were back in a bit over 24 hours. So, if you use one of those new sites, do it just 48 hours before departing to be safe. Now I'll have to do another one at the airport...grrr"
"""Now I'll have to do another one at the airport.""Kiera, you'll not only have to do an airport test, but also ""minimize interactions until the second test result is received"" https:/…06152020-COVID-MANDATE-010.pdfWhat that means: ""Minimizing interactions does not mean quarantine, but you do need to take more precautions than the usual COVID safety advice. When you buy food, eat in outdoor settings. Order delivery if possible. Wear a face covering if you go into public areas. Take part in outdoor recreation (such as fishing) instead of visiting a museum. Postpone attending gatherings until after this window is over. If you have to be in an indoor space, such as taking a short flight or riding in a shuttle to get to your lodge or outdoor activity, then everyone involved should wash their hands thoroughly and wear a face mask."" https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/ (near the bottom of the page)I don't know if that will affect your current plans. If it does, try contacting the testing site. They may be willing to amend the time. Doesn't hurt to ask. It's not like you're asking to falsify anything, just post the true time of your test.BTW, the last I heard, the airport results average 2 to 4 days, with an ultimate goal of a 2-day turnaround.Edited: 11:13 am, June 24, 2020 "
"Thanks Maple. Yes, I'll be traveling alone, staying in a stand alone private residence and off hiking around for the first several days of my trip. Plus I'm a strict mask wearer anyway in public and have sanitizer always at the ready. So I'll be doing my best to do my part to keep it safe :)I will mention the testing time when I arrive and show them when my appointment was to see if it makes a difference, but I'm not going to fight anyone about it. It is what it is and I'm just happy to be able to go."
"""I will mention the testing time when I arrive and show them when my appointment was to see if it makes a difference""Please return to this thread to let us know what happens. Good luck!"
"Okay, so, worst case scenario, if I arrive in Anchorage without a test, I'll get tested (if tests are available) and have to self quarantine until the results come back?"
trek that is correct. But results have sometimes taken 3-6 days to receive. Most people are not willing to quarantine for that long upon arrival as tourists/visitors.
Has anyone done a test other than the PCR? Were they accepted?
"Trek: From https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/ :""What kind of tests are accepted?""Posted on June 12, 2020""Alaska accepts only molecular-based tests such as the PCR tests – antibody/serology tests are not accepted.""Alaska accepts results from FDA-approved home self-test swab kits.""A molecular-based SARS-CoV2 test is any of a number of tests that detect the presence of viral RNA (genes), such as reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR, e.g. Cepheid GeneXpert, KIngFisher System, ABI 7500 system), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA, e.g. the Hologic Panther system), and Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification (e.g. Abbott ID-NOW)."""
Interesting article here on why the length of time to get the results varies so much: https:/…2929a05
"Thank you for posting this! I am pretty nervous....we are scheduled to fly to Anchorage July 21 from Orlando. That is a Tuesday, so I think we should change our flight to to the Friday before hand, as I don't think we can get tested with 72 hours and have our results back over the weekend. We are not from Orlando, we live two hours away. Is it within 72 hours of when you land in Anchorage or depart Seattle? I am most nervous because when I went to look at my tickets AA would not allow me to access any of my flights. It says because of Covid I have to call a number. When I call it is an 8 hour hold time. I went on Trip Advisor and there are horror stories of Alaskan Airlines canceling flights, not answering calls, etc. I am wondering if I should try and cancel and book with another airline?"
Thank you!
The two places I called say their test results are taking 5 to 10 days! Due to increased demand. Spokane Washington
The Urgent Care center near me is out of rapid tests. The Walgreens in Atlanta that use rapid tests (I think) currently have no appointments available for a week solid.
"If you are coming from a hot spot (TX, FL), etc, I would suggest either rescheduling your trip or do a test before flying. What if you opt to get tested at the airport and it’s positive?? Really unfair to your fellow passengers. If you can at least get tested in the 5 day window and get your results, and get retested at the airport, that’s better than nothing. Please take some personal responsibility and do your part. If you can’t get tested in the right time frame then don’t go on the trip. (I say this as an MD who is in a state that has worked really hard to get our numbers way down.) we actually decided not to do the Alaska trip this year bc of all the increasing cases in other parts of the country and potential risk of infection from flying, etc."
"I agree. Tomorrow is the day I have to decide. I'll see what they say for turnaround time and if it doesn't look good, I'll hit Montana for awhile"
Honestly if you can’t get tested don’t travel!! Montana is having an increase in cases too.
Pretty much everywhere is having an increase. I'm probably safer on the road than going back to Texas!
Ditto 115 & 117.
"I just want to say, we are all still negative!! This Texan didn't take it to Alaska! :)"
"Let me clarify - Tests with a 3 to 5 day wait for results seem to be plentiful at this time. We would not get on an airplane without being tested first. We are not in a hot spot state. Also, we are not in group settings at work, we don't use public transit, we live in the country, we don't get together with friends (unless it is outdoors and we are 6 feet apart ,and only rarely), we wear masks in public, we socially distance in publc, we are minimalists in going into stores. I would be highly surprised if our precautions don't prevent it. I think we are the kind of people you want in your state. Our trip is scheduled for later in July, so I will be making calls to see if I can figure out the possibility of getting a rapid test the day I need it."
"Has anyone used the Labcorp Pixel Covid Test? If so, when did you receive the results after sending back via FedEx?"
"From the company's website:""How long does it take to get the test results back?""Test results are available 1-2 days after we receive your sample at our lab.""7/1/2020 update: Due to a significant increase in demand, results on average may take 1-2 days longer.""https://support.pixel.labcorp.com/hc/en-us/a…"
Tourists are not the enemies! The governor of Alaska has permitted travel with restrictions. Don't bitch at us.

"Trek, you don't get to dictate how other people participate on this forum.In case you hadn't noticed, COVID-19 cases in Alaska have skyrocketed, straining their limited health system. Contact tracing was reported yesterday to be at its limit. So yes, visitors certainly CAN be ""the enemy"" if they bring the virus with them to Alaska. This isn't just the common cold: roughly 20% of cases--including younger people--have long-lasting or even permanent health issues after getting this virus. Also be aware that the rate of false negatives--where the person tests negative but is actually carrying the disease--ranges from 20% to more than twice that, depending where in the cycle the test is administered and which test is used.

Who do you think you are, acting like that on this forum, when folks that have lived here our entire lives, and help on this forum, DO NOT speak to tourists, like you, ever?

"Ferg, thanks for starting this thread. The information you and others have provided is very helpful as we get closer to our trip to Alaska. I have had great success getting reponses and updates from companies such as the Alaska Railroad and Kenai Fjords Cruises. I beileve I am now clear on the entry requirements. We may have trouble getting tested but we will follow all of Alaska's mandates. We just look at this as the price of admission. We really look forward to experiencing Alaska if indeed we are able to make the trip. Thanks again to you and others (especially Alaskans) who contributed to this thread."
What if you test 72 hours before boarding the plane for Alaska but don’t have your results back? I know you have to quarantine until you get the results but who do you have to provide the results to to get out of quarantine? The Health Dept is saying it take 3-4 days to get test results here.
"Per the FAQ on their website: https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/""You should email them to traveler@alaska.gov or fax them to 907-269-7952."""
On the link there is a COVID-19 Home testing kit for $109 (PCR). It says you get results in 48 hrs. Does any one know if this is legit? (says FDA approved). I am going in early August and it seems like it takes 5-7 days to get results around here (Central PA).
"Whether they are legitimate or not, do be aware that they also take time (& a procedure) to be delivered to you. Combine that with the 48 hrs for processing (after they get it vis overnight shipping) and you are now pretty close to a week of time from asking for the kit.The other timing issue is that you take the test at hour '0', you then have to ship it to the processor (a day?) they then take 48 hours to process; and you are now awfully close to that 72hr 'line' in the requirements."
Thanks -that's what I was afraid of. I don't want to cancel my trip because I can't get a test done in time. I will just start calling around.
How much did you have to pay for the pre-departure tests? I know upon arrival you get vouchers for the 2nd test but don't they reimburse you for your first ones?
"No, they do not reimbusre the cost, just consider it a travel expense. Cost depends on many factors. I would say anywhere from free - $200.Edited: 12:17 am, July 09, 2020 "

Thank you Maple for posting this.Things are changing and we appreciate the information.
"Things are changing in Alaska too. More and more cases every day, and a new high today. I would be paying attention to local news channels, if I was traveling. I’m curious why curioustraveler, would think it is on Alaska to “pay” for the testing they need to visit, during times like these? We have had budget concerns for some time now, so I sure hope future visitors are prepared to pay for the testing they need to travel during a tough time for travelers!Guarantee if I was “traveling” and needed testing, I would assume the financial responsibility.

"I just want to put out a bit of a warning to people. There is again a major shortage of COVID tests and reagents. The hospital I work at is likely going to stop offering testing for symptomatic outpatients next week. Meaning that even if you have symptoms, you cannot be tested. The tests we were supposed to get are being rerouted to Florida, Texas, Arizona. If you have plans to get tested coming up. Please pay close attention to what unfolds in the coming weeks."
Listed Covid spots in Anchorage...This is going to get 'fun'. The city is now going to publish any 'identifiable' locations where covid was contracted. I can't wait to see this list grow.see: https:/…
"It might be a whole lot easier, both in Alaska and California, if signs were posted in front of every bar: Covid Hot Spot. Stay Home."
"In Texas the mobile testing sites usually show up on the map from 1 to 3 days before they will be testing. The website for the testing sites is: https:/…We registered for a test inside the 5 day window. It is free and we could choose a time slot to take the test. Many locations do not do pre-registration and are first come first served type locations. We have basically treated ourselves as if we were quarantined, especially as we get closer to our travel date.Now we just have to hope we test negative so we can safely go to Alaska. Thanks again to everyone who has helped out on this thread."
We were tested at our local medical network facility on Thursday @ 8:15am. We got our negative test results back last night @ 5:30p. We're set to leave today (3:20p) . . . arriving tonight in Fairbanks! YIPPEE!!!
Have a wonderful trip.
"Leaving for Alaska Tuesday from San Antonio, TX, , will update with anything I think might be useful. Despite our arduous preparation things almost got derailed yesterday. My family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids) will be coming. The 2 adults and 1 kid tested positive for COVID in early June (Adults had symptoms, kid did not). Second child tested negative. Plan was to do the 72 hour pre-test with her, but San Antonio is really locking down on testing due to potential shortages of tests (understandable). We had to beg and plead to get her tested (and this was an urgent care, not one of the city run sites). If this trip happens feels like a minor miracle."
"“The 2 adults and 1 kid tested positive for COVID in early June (Adults had symptoms, kid did not). Second child tested negative.”Your post is confusing and troubling, the way it was written, with important information not included.

"I'm considering a trip to Kodiak later this month. An Alaskan friend told me not to get tested down here because another couple he knew that came up to ANC with their negative results within the timeframe were rejected because they were just on a jet mixing it up with 120+ people. So he recommended to get tested at the airport, go about your business (wear mask still) and be available when the phone call with your lab results are given to you. Seems like a gamble but an honor system too. Anybody else do something like this? ThanksP~Note: Pilots and Flight Attendants who are mixed in with people from all over are exempt and can stay over in Anchorage, go to a restaurant and return to work the next morning. Not fair."
"""An Alaskan friend told me not to get tested down here because another couple he knew that came up to ANC with their negative results within the timeframe were rejected because they were just on a jet mixing it up with 120+ people""Does your friend have a source for their statement?

If you don't get tested prior to arriving in Alaska , no you wont' ""go about your business (wear mask still) and be available when the phone call with your lab results are given to you."". You will go directly into QUARANTINE while you await the results (averaging 60 hours as of last week). You cannot leave your hotel room except for medical reasons.

"We arrived in Alaska with negative results 2+ weeks ago now. We had no issues going through nor did any of the other visitors I spoke with during our 16 days in Alaska. I agree in theory that traveling across the country, you're mixing it up with all sorts of germs but those aren't the rules Alaska's leadership has elected to apply. Negative results 72 hours before arrival and you're good to enter with just a brief stop at the screening stations."
The friend of mine met visitors (about 3 weeks ago) who came up with their negative results from Michigan from a test less than 72 hrs prior and the ANC airport stated that you will still need to be tested. They had no choice.
"mcdonagh05, since your friend implied that his visitors were allowed to ""go about their business"" while awaiting airport results, I suspect they did NOT have results of their first test within 72 hrs of departure., but MISSED that deadline and fell into the 5 day category (requiring an airport test and restricting interactions until the results of the airport test are back).I quoted you the exact rules in post 173. I'm not sure why you don't believe it, but that's up to you.Note also from the link I provided above: ""Ability to receive testing is subject to availability and not guaranteed, so it is highly recommended to get tested before travel to avoid having to quarantine while waiting for results."" In many places in the USA testing supplies are running low, and it's taking even longer to get results back.It is a BAD idea to wait to get to Anchorage to have your first test, unless you're willing to quarantine for 2 to 4 days awaiting results."
"""It is a BAD idea to wait to get to Anchorage to have your first test, unless you're willing to quarantine for 2 to 4 days awaiting results.""And then continue to quarantine for an additional 14 days if you test positive........"
"Yep, Mombear, that's always a possibility. Especially in view of the new update by CDC: ""New guidance by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 40 percent of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and the chance of transmission from people with no symptoms is 75 percent."" https://www.sciencealert.com/40-of-people-wi…So a traveler could be feeling perfectly fine, totally unaware they are infected with the virus and therefore capable of transmitting it to others, and receive a very rude shock if they don't get tested before leaving home. Not to mention all the people on the airplane who were sitting in the same general area who are now in danger...which wouldn't happen if the traveler found out his/her status before leaving home."
"Has anyone gotten tested within 72 hours of departure for Alaska at Walgreen's with the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 test? Was it excepted at the airport?

"I have something to contribute... Forgive if old news. Starting today (that's what they said) they are no longer accepting the printed declaration form. So even if you show up with the declaration form completely filled out like a few dozen people did, they will direct you to your smartphone or tablets that the employees have, to fill out the online form. I would go to the website as they say it is now updated. The link for the online form is https://app.kelvin.care/It was my understanding you could do this ahead of time and already have it done when you landed. However, I would double-check that. It was as you can imagine a bit chaotic being the first day of this new process."
"We arrived in Anchorage this afternoon. My husband and I tested at Walgreens on Tuesday afternoon. We received our negative results in a few hours. They were using the Abbott ID NOW rapid test. It is a molecular test and was accepted at the airport. We filled out the traveler declaration form online and we passed through the checkpoint in less than 5 mins. It is a bit nerve wracking not knowing whether you’re going to be going on a trip until less than 72 hours before departure, but it all worked out fine. There was a long line of people who didn’t test prior and didn’t fill out the form online. I wouldn’t recommend coming without a negative test. Can’t wait to start our adventure!"
I'm so happy for you!! Have fun!! Be safe! And make memories!
"Thank you for following the safety procedures set up by our state. I especially appreciate your recc not to travel, without a negative test beforehand. I hope you enjoy Alaska, during a very different kind of summer up here. Deb"
"For those that have done the at home testing, which of the eight companies did you use and how long before you received your results?"
Are there any restrictions or forms you have to show when flying FROM Alaska to the lower 48?
Matthew...- do you mean at the AK airport of departure?
"Yes, flying from Fairbanks to Seattle. I saw mentioned somewhere not being able to leave Alaska unless you test negative."
"FYI... thank interesting article. I don’t necessarily “like” the source, but this was well written. I appreciated the writing, and info. Debhttps:/…"
The five of us made it into Alaska with our 72 hour Covid test. First of all DO THE ONLINE DECLARATION DOCUMENT in advance! That’s what makes it easy. They will ask and if you have done this you will have your QR code that was emailed to you. We all had the paper print out of the negative test results. Today there is one line and a waiting area. You don’t get in line until you have done the online declaration. When we came in on July 16 there were two lines. Our two people who came in July 19 had only the one line as stated above. Best to have things ready for a smooth experience.
"OK I am so glad I found this forum. Our family is scheduled to depart for Anchorage next Monday, the 27. I am having a very difficult time finding a rapid test that is also PCR. Sooo, I am afraid that we will not have our results back before we depart for Alaska. I assume we will just test Friday evening or Saturday morning and hope we get the results back in time. My question is two-fold. #1-If we do not have a negative result upon landing, do we have to ""quarantine"" or ""minimize interaction"". Is there a difference? We will be in a fishing camp with our family only so minimizing interaction will not be an issue but not sure if we will be allowed to even go to the camp? Question #2 is this-What happens one of us tests positive? Are we sent home on the next flight? Can that individual ""quarantine"" at the camp? Thanks in advance for any clarification and I apologize if this has been covered already and I missed it."
"""#1-If we do not have a negative result upon landing, do we have to ""quarantine"" or ""minimize interaction"". Is there a difference?""Quarantine. No fishing camp. Hotel room (or similar) without leaving it except for medical reasons. If you're not sure you can get results back in time, take a PCR test within 5 days of going to Alaska if that will give you results by your arrival. Then you need to take a second test at the airport, but can go to your fishing camp as long as you minimize interactions. ""The State of Alaska will accept results from tests taken up to five days prior to departure, but you will be required to take a second test when you arrive and to minimize your interactions until you receive the results (you will not be under quarantine)."" https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/""What happens one of us tests positive?""""You will be required to isolate at your own expense for 14 days, or until you are cleared by a public health nurse after receiving a subsequent negative test.

"Our Experience With COVID-19 TestingDate of Trip: 7/11-7/26 2020Arrival/Departure Location: Fairbanks AirportWe tested prior to our trip through our medical provider on Thursday 7/9/20 @ 8:15am and received our negative test results Friday 7/10/20 @ 5:30pm. They billed it out at $150, with the insurance company discounting it by $45 and paying $105. There was no out-of-pocket expense to us per the EOB we just received.Upon arrival at Fairbanks Airport (11:15pm) they had the COVID-19 check-in area in the baggage claim area, with three lines: residents returning, out of state visitors WITH COVID-19 results in hand and out of state visitors with 5 day (no results yet) or untested prior to departure from home.All lines went quickly. With our test results in hand, we breezed through with our ""Mandatory Declarations"" in hand. (We did not file electronically prior to arrival in AK)For those needing to be tested upon arrival, they had an area set up to privately do that.We were provided the voucher for the 7-14 day follow-up testing while in Alaska. Because we were unable to get to a site during the 14 day period, we did test upon our departure from Fairbanks on day #15 (Sunday night @ 10:30pm testing . . . our flight was 12:50am). They reported we will be emailed our results in ""about three days."" There were no hassles or questions about not getting the follow-up test done within the 14 day window.It should be noted they do have test sites statewide. For us being in remote locations, and relatively off the grid for much of the time we were in Alaska, it was a challenge. We had planned to be tested at the public health office in Valdez, but they had limited hours with nothing available on the weekend.All in all, for us, it was pretty smooth. I was surprised at the number of people who apparently had no clue about the COVID-19 testing mandate as there were a lot of people having to deal with it upon arrival in Fairbanks on 7/11. Most were polite about it, but there was one rather defiant couple. I'm sure they complied eventually.As always, I'm willing to answer any follow-up questions.TSVon"
"Effective August 11, all visitors to Alaska must arrive with a negative COVID-19 test administered within 72 hours of departure. ""The state wants to conserve limited testing resources to address a rise in cases within local communities.""Reference: https:/…"
How did you get test results within 72 hours? And did you present a print out of test results or can you show emailed test results on your phone?
Having your location showing beneath your name would be of help to some perhaps to answer your question.

I just wanted to be post # 200.
"Leaving for Alaska this Saturday. Has anyone tested at the airport and know the turnaround time for the results? I took a at home test from Everlywell which is one of the companies approved by the state of Alaska yesterday, shipped it off next day delivery and UPS seems to have lost my package. I did everything right but now that's out of my hands and the lab might reject the test if it comes in too late"
"""Has anyone tested at the airport and know the turnaround time for the results? ""- Do not expect a quick turnaround. The state is running short on a reagent used in processing; and medically needed processing is being done first. - worst case scenario is are you prepared to quarantine for 14 days?"
"I’m only there for 11 days. Finally heard back from Everlywell and was told that the shelf life of the sample test “can” be good up to 7 days but the lab will determine it. Hopefully UPS can get it to the lab tomorrow. They’re confident it’s in UPS possession though there’s no tracking info indicating it. I Managed to schedule a test at a local urgent care tomorrow in case. But these turnaround results in CA are really slow, fingers crossed"
Hi Luvvaction58 - what Walgreens in Chicago did you get tested at? Did you make an appointment?Thanks!
"So I’m currently in Seward and just wanted to let people know my experience. I ordered the at home kit from Everlywell.com. Did the home test 72 hours before my flight. UPS delayed my overnight returned by one day. Arrived in anchorage Saturday night and had the declaration form filled out on phone before boarding with option 1B (tested within 72 hrs but waiting for results). After filling out the online form they will email you QR code. Most people on the flight didn’t have one filled out so they were standing on the side doing it last minute. So even though I was one of the last off the flight I was up pretty quick to one of the desk. They scanned in my QR code saw all my info, asked me to quarantine until results comes in and I was free to leave. I received the negative results Sunday morning. Had UPS not delayed I would’ve gotten the results when before I landed(48 hours after the lab received the test kit). I chose this route because CVS and other clinics were telling me 4-7 days for results to come back"
"I am very happy that I found this thread. The information is very helpful! I will be flying into Anchorage from the continental United States (out of state traveler).I did read through several of the last pages and the first few pages of this thread. I have found the FAQs and I believe that I understand the process. After calling a few local testing facilities, I think that the online testing facilities might be less expensive and have a faster turn around than most local testing centers.I read through the https://app.kelvin.care/ website, the FAQs on the official Alaskan site, and through some responses here, but I do have a question that I didn't see answered (forgive me if I have overlooked it).For those of you that took one of the approved mail-in tests, how did you prove that you took it within 72 hours of departure?If I leave at noon on the 24th of August and I order my kit on the 17th of August, then take it after noon on the 21st of August will they take my word that that was the date and time that I took it? Or do they go by the date the lab received it? I understand that overnight shipping might be the best option. Or would I need additional proof as to the exact date and time that I took the test at home? Sorry if this seems like a stupid question but I want to cover everything that I can before leaving. I don't want to have to take a test again as soon as I get there because I couldn't provide adequate proof that I took the test within 72 hours of departure. I am prepared to quarantine if the negative results are not in by the time I get to Anchorage.Thank you if you can help!"
"I have the same question, Erin. I am also flying on the 24th. I ordered and have received my test kit from picture genetics so I'm ready to take it on Saturday, the 22nd but I'm concerned about providing proof. I'm wondering if the lab sends out a confirmation email once the test is received that also includes the date and time that you took the test itself. Since I have to take and send on a Saturday, I'm doubtful that I'll get results back until at least Tuesday but I definitely want to be able to provide proof at landing that the test was taken within the required timeframe.TLDR: when taking a mail in test, will we receive an email from the lab when they receive the test that includes the date and time that the swab was taken?"
"“when taking a mail in test, will we receive an email from the lab when they receive the test that includes the date and time that the swab was taken?”- the question of ‘proving swab time’ is interesting/appropriate.- not sure how the testing company could send you any detail on when you swabbed as how would they know beyond information you sent them (which could be truth or not)- I’d get in the state’s COvid site and send an email/question listed there- I’m sure many travelers have already done what you are doing. I have not read/seen where anyone has had an issue at the airport."
"Excellent point/suggestion, Scott. I'll send them an email. They are so quick at responding. I don't know why I didn't think of that before."
"Ashley, why don't you take the test on Friday afternoon then the testing service will receive it on Saturday and you could get the results by Monday. That is what I have read others on the forum have done."
"Ashley,Please let us know what they say when you receive the response. I am in same boat will be performing Picture Genetics Self Swab and want to understand what counts as proof of taking the test in time."
"It was not in Chicago. It was in Des Plaines, on Oakton. You have to register on Walgreens website and request an appointment."
"Ashley, I sent them an email as well. Still waiting on the response but I will post when I get it back. I hope you have great trip!"
"I emailed the official email listed on the official government page (covidquestions@alaska.gov) and this was the response they sent me back:""Hello,The lab will time stamp it initially.I took a at home test last month and scheduled my pickup within the same hour I took the test.Results were back within 48 hours for me. If you arrive and the results are pending, you will be advised to quarantine at a location of your choosing until your results are known.Safe Travels!""So, it looks like they base it off of whatever the lab you use timestamps as your time of taking the test. So, I am going to just go ahead and order one and see what the instructions say for this step.I assume that it will probably be explained in the kit, or if anyone is still confused, the testing company probably will have a number you can call."
Oh that's very interesting considering I could technically take the test Friday morning then even though I don't leave until Monday evening which is outside of the 72 hour window.I received essentially the same response though I think whoever responded to you phrased it better. They recommended I take the test Friday morning so I guess that's what I'll do and hopefully have a result before I board on Monday evening!
There is no real way to prove it as the mail in test are not time stamped. I did it exactly 72 hours before but I suppose I could’ve done it few hours earlier since you’re waiting for UPS or Fedex to pick it up. They didn’t ask for the time stamp upon arrival in anchorage just the QR code they didn’t ask for proof of pending results. I arrived Saturday night and stayed in my hotel and got the results Sunday morning. Emailed to the results and I was off. I’m not sure about the new process that was implemented yesterday however
"I traveled before the new mandate went into the effect and in my declaration I requested Alaska to test me. I did not get tested before I left. The AA flight from Chicago was full and many people I spoke with did not even know about any testing requirements let alone having been tested.At Anchorage airport the line was fairly long but moving. At departure level they told me to go downstairs and turn left where a clinic called Curetec has set up some kiosks to be tested (right by the bag claim carrousel). There was a line there as well but I got in and out in about 30 minutes. I got my results back in 4 days.I suggest you pay 250 at ANC airport if you have a slightest doubt that you won't get results back from your home city in time instead of paying double. Also, if you are going to be in Alaska for more than 14 days, they require you to be tested after 7 to 14 days of your arrival."
"If a visitor waits to get tested in Anchorage, they are *supposed* to quarantine for the 4 days (or however long it takes to get negative results). Since you said you were going to Alaska to work, how did your employer handle that?"
"The at home test was under $110 and there is a chance you will get results before you depart. I ordered my kit 10 days before my departure date got it in the mail within 3 days, sat on my counter until 72 hours before my flight. $250 sounds steep to me. Testing at the airport would be least time efficient if you’re there for a short time"
"Thanks for the info. Is a photo copy of test results good enough to show upon arrival or are they looking for something notarized or more ""official""?"
"Ashley I was not advocating that you should test yourself outside of 72 hours before departure. Very few flights From the lower 48 to Alaska depart in the evening. I made an incorrect assumption that your flight departs during the day on a Monday.Edited: 11:48 am, August 14, 2020 "
"""They recommended I take the test Friday morning so I guess that's what I'll do and hopefully have a result before I board on Monday evening!""If you do that, be prepared to spend your trip quarantining in Alaska or taking a second test at the airport and quarantining for about 4 days or however long it takes to get those test results back. As fti said, you're outside of the 72 testing window and as of Aug. 11 that is no longer acceptable.If you leave Monday night, test no sooner than Friday evening. If you're worried results won't be back by the time you arrive in Alaska, plan an easy first day that could be spent in quarantine if necessary. That means sheltering in a hotel or something similar, not going outside for ANY reason except medical care (meals would have to be delivered to your door)."
">>>Also, if you are going to be in Alaska for more than 14 days, they require you to be tested after 7 to 14 days of your arrival.<<<All out of state visitors sign saying they will retest in Alaska between 7 and 14 days after their arrival to Alaska. The mandatory declaration form states ""I consent to take another test between 7-14 days after arrival in Alaska . . ."" (UNLESS THE DECLARATION FORM HAS CHANGED SINCE 7/11/20.)With that said, my husband found something on an AK website ""somewhere"" that they were not enforcing this as there were too many logistical challenges for visitors, particularly in smaller rural communities/villages.Case in point, the time/days we had set aside to do our retesting in Valdez, their public health department was not open. So we ended up retesting on our 15th day, back at the Fairbanks Airport the evening we were departing to return home from Alaska.We tested on Sunday (around 10pm) and got our results back within 72 hours (mine was 48 and hubby's was 60) . . . both negative.They gave us vouchers when we arrived in Alaska, so there was no charge to us. (WOW at the $250 previously mentioned!)Edited: 8:48 am, August 16, 2020 "
Are the results from a rapid exam acceptable?
"""You must provide proof of a molecular based PCR swab test result with your Declaration Form. No other type of test is acceptable."" https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/"
"""Are the results from a rapid exam acceptable?""- it depends... some rapid tests are PCR molecular and some are not. The test most be 'PCR molercular'."
"Ferg- can you post your flying experience coming back to your home state? Did the airport screen again or make sure everybody submitted their tests? Also, how long were you in Alaska and did you take advantage of the second test with their voucher? Thanks!!"
I'm spending only 5 days in Alaska . My concern is that the results are not available when I land in Anchorage. All my plans will go for a toss. Is that a possibility?
"""I'm spending only 5 days in Alaska . My concern is that the results are not available when I land in Anchorage. All my plans will go for a toss. Is that a possibility?""- if you do not have the results when you land your plans will be disruptedSimply :- if you show proof of a test being administered 72 hr before departure you are required to quarantine unit the results arrive.- otherwise you get tested at the airport ($250 per person) and quarantine until those results come in.Actual site & words...see: …alaska.gov/dph/…travel.aspxNon-ResidentsTest 72 hours before departure, and upload negative result into the Alaska Travel PortalIf tested 72 hours before departure and awaiting results, travelers will need to upload proof of test taken into the Alaska Travel Portal and quarantine while waiting.If a non-resident arrives without a pre-test, testing is available for $250 per test. The traveler will be required to quarantine while waiting on results. If a non-resident is still in the state after 7 days, a second test should be taken 7-14 days after arrival. Until a second negative test result is returned, or 14 days have passed, travelers should practice strict social distancing."
"Do they enforce the ""Strict Social Distancing?"" Per their FAQ's even after a negative test is shown upon arrival you must strict social distance until you get tested again after 7-14 days. Strict social distance basically says you cannot enter any restaurants or participate in any group activities, which would eliminate all guided tours. Do any tour guides, or boat tours, etc... ask to see your second test to make sure you are in the clear outside of the ""Strict Social Distancing"""
"""Do they enforce the ""Strict Social Distancing?""- who do you mean by 'they'?We do not have a COvid Police force.I enforce myself and I do expect others to enforce themselves as well."
"Hawaii has a ""they"" where they will text and possibly show up at your place of quarantine to make sure you're not breaking protocol, but I understand that would be impossible in places like AK. However maybe there was something in place that required tour operators to make sure you've been in the state for 7+ days. (Which would be the minimum to exit the ""Strict Social Distancing."""
