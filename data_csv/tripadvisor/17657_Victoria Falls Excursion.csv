"I am considering several tours of South Africa with excursions to Victoria Falls. Some stay at hotels in Zambia, others in Zimbabwe. Which affords the better view of the Falls? I have heard that there are safety problems on the Zimbabwe side. Is this so? I'll welcome all advice on this.Grunsony"
"The photograph at this site: victoriafalls365.com/Victoria_falls.jpgshows clearly that Victoria Falls pours into a deep gorge and the very best views of it will always be from an aircraft. You have your choice of an ultralight, helicopter, or small fixed wing plane. And I absolutely recommend one of these.In the photograph, all of the land on the right, opposite the Falls, is Zimbabwe - and (though it doesn't show in the picture) a paved walkway goes all along the face of the Falls in Zimbabwe with several points where it goes right to the edge of the gorge on the Zimbabwe side.If you look to the top of the picture you see a darker strip of green - which is the vegetation on the bank, and that is Zambia - beyond the farthest falling water.The only view of the Falls from Zambia would be something such as this:http://www.monnikhof.com/Victoria-Falls-2.jpgIn fact, you can see the end of the Zimbabwe walkway just below the rainbow.Incidentally, both these pictures were taken during the very low flow season. I have been there in May and June when the enormous water flow creates a spray so dense it is a challenge to see the Falls at all - and you will be drenched just trying to do so.Safety problems in Zimbabwe? No. Not to tourists. For the Zimbabwe people? Yes. If they are on the wrong side of the politics. "
"BwanaDave,Thanks for the advice and great photos, giving me some perspective on the situation of the Falls. If we were not to have the opportunity to take an air trip, can you tell me which hotels afford easy access to good views from land (and also good quakity accommodations. I need all the advice I can get."
"On the Zimbabwe side, Ilala Lodge is the closest.. a nice (I would rate at) 3+ star place with small rooms but nice public areas. It's a few minutes walk to the entrance to the Falls. Rated #4 by Trip Advisor travelers. The Kingdom is a sort of big Disneyland looking place also near the Falls, and the Victoria Falls Hotel is the Grande Dame of the lodging. All of these are in the town of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. As for the flights, they are not at all expensive, and I still recommend you try to fit that in. On the Zambia side, the Royal Livingstone and its cheaper sister, the Zambezi Sun, are literally right on the river, just above the Falls.We once griped about the visa fee for Zimbabwe; now the fee for Zambia is even higher. Both are expensive. Make sure you know all of the costs when you are setting your budget."
Many thanks for your helpful advice. For a variety of reasons--including deteriorating health care facilities and a cholera epidemic in Zim--I'm leaning toward staying on the Zambian side and perhaps taking the plane excursion for the full view.
