"How bad is it, for real ? ............and what does one do / bring to help prevent it ? Just getting back into the forum loop here, as my return trip is in May. So far, I'm ""hearing"" State side here, that is IS AN ISSUE. Some ""in the know"" feedback would be most appreciated, and thank you ! Tom"
I have no heard of anyone contracting since late fall. That is not to say it may not be an issue but it is certain not a major issue.Wear bug spray all the time. That is what you can do.
"Go to the search engine and type in ""chikungunya"", change the search date to most recent and you'll find a bunch of threads on the subject - ditto on the St Thomas and St Croix forums. The epidemic status has long passed and you avoid it with repellents just as you've been avoiding dengue for the last many years.Edited: 5 years ago "
FABULOUS !!!!! Thank you so much ! Exactly what I was hoping to hear !
Recent article/update that I just read this morning....stjohnsource.com/content/news/local-news/201â€¦
Is bug spray a reasonable price on the islands? Or should I bring some from home?Edited: 5 years ago 
"Just returned two weeks ago and my on island friend had contracted chickengunya. Her symptoms are flu like, tired, very achy. Bring lots of bug spray. We encountered one year with tons of mosquitoes but since then I can't say we've been bothered by them."
"We find bug spray with little trouble. Its usually about the same markup as other on-island products. Specialty products at the Chelsea Drug Store are more. We hit Food Center on the way to Red Hook for the picaridin-based Cutter Advanced and it works great.Cheers, RickG"
"As always, right there for us, thanks, Rick ! I'm glad it seems the ""epidemic"" wave seems to have passed. I'm not there until May, but was concerned about this, as we all should be."
"FYI, I must report that I still got a few bites earlier this month despite vigilantly using DEET bug spray (and DEET wipes to supplement the spray). In fact, I covered myself in bug spray to the point that my travelling companion pointed out that I might not get chikungunya or dengue, but I might instead get damage to my skin and central nervous system. I still got about 4 total bites - mostly on my left hand for some reason (even though I had used DEET wipes on both hands). The bites themselves were small and not bothersome, but I was totally spooked by the thought of contracting chikungunya or dengue. However, I've just passed through what I understand to be the typical incubation period for chikungunya and no symptoms. Yay! I think I should have a ""Chikungunya-Free"" party to celebrate......preferably back down on STJ, since up here in DC it's freezing and we're supposed to get snow AGAIN tonight!"
...........awesome post !
"Last visit I used picaridin wipes- bought at EMS instead of DEET. I feel DEET is so toxic but I sure do not want a mossie borne disease again. Picaridin seemed to work just as effectively. I did get some bites but certainly did not cover myself with the product. Another positive was the finish on my plastic water bottle was not ""melted"" as it used to be from DEET! CDC approves the picaridin based products as mosquito repellant."
