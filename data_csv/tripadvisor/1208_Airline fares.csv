How low do you think airline fares will go during this COVID-19 crisis?Do you think they will increase after this nightmare is over?Thanks!
"yeah, the airlines are bleeding cash and will need to repay loans so look for fares to go up once the nightmare ends. Add to that all the people who have vouchers for missed or canceled flights and the seats will be limited."
They already have increased a lot since the quarantine was instituted.
I changed a flight two days ago and got a $200 refund because the price was lower. Whether the flight will actually happen is another matter. I've been following the flights I typically take to/from LAX-ITO and all have been cancelled for the last week. Caveat emptor.The airline industry is permanently changed by this event. Do not expect airlines to be business as usual after COVID-19. What does that mean for fares? Don't know.
"Follow up to my previous post on April 2 -- my rebooked flight has indeed been cancelled. Flights to California are priced wildly different from one day to the next and decisions to cancel are made day to day. My best guess has been to re-book leaving from Kona instead of Hilo -- possibly more passengers, thus more likely to fly. Also booked a date in early May rather than April, giving the virus more time to level off. I don't really want to fly in the middle of the shutdown, and fortunately I have my own house for shelter-in -place. International airlines are publishing expectations to remain on minimum schedules through May and even June. I have seen prices range from ""normal"" to 5x normal. So take your time planning future trips anywhere on the planet."
Have no clue how long this is going to last but I'm pretty sure that once this is over we are going to see an increase in airline fares. Quite a few airlines will not make it and they will either go bankrupt or consolidate. Competition leads to lower prices. So just looking at basic economy rules with less competition the prices go up. And we are probably going to see the reflection of this in airfare prices sometime next year.
"""Quite a few airlines will not make it and they will either go bankrupt or consolidate""United, American, Delta, SWA and Alaska aren't going anywhere and the government bailout virtually guarantees this. Not unlike the auto makers, the US would never allow it from an economic standpoint. Human beings have short memories and with the ""surge"" not happening in most of the country, millions of people are waiting on the sidelines to book travel, posts on this forum even confirm that. The one issue that'll come up over time is the private sale of hundreds of condo's that are currently in the rental markets. A condo you have money on for a December stay may be on the real estate market or be sold by then. The ""average"" vacation home owner relies on rental income to make mortgage payments. A few month's loss of income is hard to overcome, especially the summer high-season market."
Good points from Clint.......but I will add that foreclosures on condos and vac. homes will rise too.
"""Have no clue how long this is going to last but I'm pretty sure that once this is over we are going to see an increase in airline fares.""Very doubtful. Airlines will desperately need to fill planes and will do what it takes to incentivize travelers. Low fares are virtually certain, at least for a time.I have seen a report showing many major airlines anticipating a resumption of large numbers of flights May 20. It is likely more of a ""test"" announcement than a firm commitment. Airlines need to see how governments respond, how potential customers respond."
"Airlines ... and cruise lines ... no matter how odd this may sound ... are critical to national security. The Feds won't let them dissolve or disappear. Will we see some merging? Maybe. Probably. I think that if the travel industry experiences a HUGH rush ... major pent-up demand ... and we wave our MasterCards and jump up and down ... then sure, the prices will spike. And a lot of folks simply will not be able to afford travel. And priorities on how they use their time, as well as money, will change. BUT if we are wary about travel - especially without a vaccine - then prices will remain low. Hotels will probably lay-off some staff. Close down some wings. Restaurants and activities will reduce hours ... those kinds of things.Our first trip to Oahu/Maui was right after 9/11 - and that colors my thinking."
The airlines are getting HUGE bailouts.....and much of the money doesn't have to be paid back. So I wouldn't nec expect them to be begging for customers.
"I was just pondering ... that travelers may end up signing significant legal liability documents to travel by air, etc. Carrying documentation of vaccination (once available) may become standard. Thinking about blame-game lawsuits."
"""The airlines are getting HUGE bailouts.....and much of the money doesn't have to be paid back. So I wouldn't nec expect them to be begging for customers.""United, just one airline, is losing $100 million per day in revenue. If nobody flies, there will be no airline, regardless of the $5 billion in federal aid. Expect to see early retirement packages offered in an effort to reduce headcount as well as other cost cuts. With 90% of flights cancelled and essentially zero demand with no expectation of immediate improvement, the bailout is a helping hand, but not a fix. And this is just one airline. They will be eager to get you to fly again.BLBL, I have heard stories that you'll have your temperature taken before being allowed to board, but you are right, things could get more complicated."
"I've heard about temp screens, too. And it's a good idea that may be a keeper."
"My answer was oversimplified, I agree. But there will also be lots of juggling and lots of arrogance from the airlines, just like last time......IMO.As for lawsuits--well, how would you ever prove *at what stage or place* you got it? At home? In the departure airport? A restaurant? Car Rental office/counter? Hotel? Remember, incubation can be up to 14 days.........so I think lawsuits are losers in most scenarios. Just today, a case on Maui was disclosed in which the person was negative on April 9th--but positive on April 14th. In that case, we happen to know where the case came from........our hospital :-((((((. But most times people aren't going to be able to pin it down.And the temp scans are a different form of TSA, IMO--because of the huge number of asymptomatic carriers. They might make you feel better but I think they are theater."
