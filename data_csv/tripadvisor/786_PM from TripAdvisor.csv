"HiAnyone had a PM from TA offering them Trip Protection?A little stupid sending it to me as when I click on it I get the message ""Travel insurance is not yet available from Tripadvisor in your country"""
oh no now they are going into the insurance business? Can just see the claimants coming on this support forum for help filing the claims!!! I trust people will get their insurance from a well know company that actually pays the claims.
"Yes, I just scanned through it. [shrug]It's fine in theory, but if I'm going to buy trip insurance - and I well might in the future - I'm going to buy it direct, not through TripAdvisor. Gene, it's ""powered by Allianz"", whatever that means and whoever they are. They might well be a reputable company, I haven't needed to research this.Edited: 10:34 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"[eyeroll] In other news, typing ""trip insurance"" now creates an auto-link to their page."
Allianz is a very large International insurer and a German company.
"""Allianz is a very large International insurer and a German company.""and a very reputable onePersonally, I have no issues with TA marketing Trip Insurance and it is a good fit for their business"
But does it cover for Covid-19?!SWT
"""But does it cover for Covid-19?!""Good question but as it does not cover people in the UK who knows!!!!!"
I got the same one yesterday...Laugh ? I nearly choked on my Cornflakes...
"Yes.Got that yesterday, and just sent it to the bin.Hunt"
"Ok, so what's wrong with me, I did not get any TA offers......I would like to laugh"
You make me feel better:) Thank you
