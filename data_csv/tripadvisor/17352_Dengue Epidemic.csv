"I just came back from the Dominican Republic, two days after my arrival I came down with Dengue Fever (thank God it was not the hemorragic type). The Dominican government insist that there are outbreak of the virus but while I was there (before I even knew I was infected with the virus) I talked to locals about the situation, tthey said that the newspapers had reported that the hospitals were full of people with Dengue and that 36 people had died so far from the illness. If you must go to the DR, please take precautions, go to the CDC website and follow their advice, protect yourself and your children from mosquito bites. I was very ill, at times I felt I was going to die. I don't know how come the CDC does not put up a health alert knowing very well what is going on there. BE SAFE, don't go"
