"Hi there, I'm trying to clarify if me and my friend can enter Thailand with a 30 day VISA exemption. I have a UK passport and my friend has a Phillipines passport, can we enter Thailand with a valid medical certificate and use the VISA exemption scheme? Are they enforcing the $100,000 insurance, where can we get this if they are?"
"Hi thank you, can the insurance be standard travel insurance? I don't think any insurer is covering corona?"
"As a general rule you can't insure for a ""known event"" which Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is. So i doubt any insurance you take out would cover the costs of medical treatment if you contracted it etc. Good luck with obtaining a certificate as well!!Edited: 3:15 am, March 24, 2020 "
"If the insurance depends on a 'known event' then it would depend on what a 'known event' is defined to be.However, insurance is about knowing about a known risk and calculating the likelihood of a particular outcome.I am concerned that my insurer will not pay out in relation to the coronavirus because it was not a 'known event'.It may claim 'force majeure'."
"It's clear in the Thai government announcement - the insurance MUST cover you for COVID-19.Good luck with getting that!!As for being a known event, that classification was adopted by insurance companies once WHO announced that it was a global pandemic. There's an exact date, even a time, for this - you can Google to find out.Edited: 4:46 am, March 24, 2020 "
"If a condition for obtaining a Thai visa is medical insurance (including cover for coronavirus) and that insurance cannot be obtained, then does not that effectively mean that Thailand has closed its borders?"
"No. I read (okay, I only 'read') on here somewhere that a passenger had got insurance which covered COVID-19, but had paid an arm and a leg for it. Must've been desperate to come!So, for a price, the insurance cover seems to be available somewhere. And, if that's presented at check-in, then the criteria has been met."
Post #31 in this thread has just said they were refused boarding in Bali because Thai Airways requested a blood test report. Do you have this?https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g46â€¦
The issue I have is that I have medical insurance but it was issued months before coronavirus.The insurance policy obviously does not mentioned coronavirus.The insurance company was obviously unaware of the risk of coronavirus and did not take it into consideration when pricing the medical cover (the risk). My question is whether insurance companies are claiming force majeure because of the coronavirus.
"#11 ""Force Majeure"" is notoriously hard to define. However in the UK it often covers such things such as ""plagues or epidemics. and biological contamination"" which generally covers virus so I suspect if your cover pre-dates the ""known event"" then they will likely invoke the "" Force Majeure"" clause"
As far as I know all insurance contracts and many many other commercial contracts have force majeure clauses.And probably unable to get insurance after coronavirus 'became known'.Private health insurance is a tad useless.I think I will need to rely on the public health system provided by Thailand or pay for the private hospital.I don't think private hospitals have ICU facilities as they a simply too expensive to run to make a profit.I presume each country will provide public health care to everyone in the country on the understanding every other country will do the same. Thus all Thais in the UK and Australia etc get access to public hospitals as will UK and Australian citizens in Thailand.
