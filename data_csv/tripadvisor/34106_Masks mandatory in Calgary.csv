"For those who haven’t heard, effective August 1, masks will become mandatory in all indoor public buildings and public transit in Calgaryhttps://calgary.ctvnews.ca/calgary-makes-mas…The mayor is currently in discussions with the mayors of surrounding towns to see if they will also support this move."
Don't go to Calgary.2nd paragraph: https:/…NEJMp2006372
"Public buildings and public transport are a start. We need to wear masks on public transit here in Van. But I think people need to be careful in other places too. As I've said before, this virus is an opportunist. It will be happy to infect the closest person who has not protected themselves."
"It's been proven that a Mask is the best vaccine available right now.Also , this was published Apr 1 2020And Read the letter section of the article. by these same docs,We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org)1 as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less. It is apparent that many people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet highly contagious and that these people account for a substantial fraction of all transmissions.2,3 Universal masking helps to prevent such people from spreading virus-laden secretions, whether they recognize that they are infected or not.4We did state in the article that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection,” but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments. A growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact: the risk of transmission among household members can be as high as 40%, whereas the risk of transmission from less intense and less sustained encounters is below 5%.5-7 This finding is also borne out by recent research associating mask wearing with less transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in closed settings.8 We therefore strongly support the calls of public health agencies for all people to wear masks when circumstances compel them to be within 6 ft of others for sustained periods.Michael Klompas, M.D., M.P.H."
"This is the second time the same poster have referenced the second paragraph of that article to contradict the current known facts. The first time it was regarding indoor v outdoor.It's mind boggling how people manage to find a needle in a haystack, misinterpret it, and use it to contradict a mountain or credible evidence and science.Edited: 9:49 am, July 23, 2020 "
Quite frankly we’d be extremely happy to have the anti-maskers like poster #1 stay away!
Good for the city of Calgary. As for poster 1 - I prefer my science to be current. Not from 3 months ago. The guy from Edmonton might not understand that advice about this virus is constantly evolving.
He deleted his comment. He probably never read the whole article. Must be a Trump supporter.
"Actually, he didn't delete it - the placeholder says it was reported as ""inappropriate by the TripAdvisor community"". Personally, I contemplated zapping it, but none of the categories fit and I didn't think it was appropriate to try to delete it just because I don't agree with it. I had googled and found other studies, some pre-dating the one quoted, and others since, that contradicted the one referenced, but when I was going to post links, powrun had already posted #3, so I didn't feel they were necessary.Calgary has mandated masks, and Edmonton and Banff are contemplating doing similarly. I hope that it will pressure more and more towns and cities, including Jasper, to do the same. It's not just reining in everybodies droplets... I think it's also a visual reminder to keep distance."
"Wise words krp and I liked this ""I didn't think it was appropriate to try to delete it just because I don't agree with it."" ""Must be a Trump supporter"" when there is an opposing viewpoint, is more Trump like than the differing position in post 1.But anyway, that’s not why I dropped in.I just read the following with concern for my neighbours; https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alber…Not the fragmenting, although it would be nice to see everyone on the same page, but the state of the pandemic in Alberta, if true.>> From July 7 to 21, it recorded the most new cases, per capita, of all provinces, according to federally compiled data.Alberta also saw the highest percentage of positive tests over that time, and now has the highest per-capita rate of active cases in Canada. Its hospitalization rate is on the rise and second only to Quebec.<< Were I an American, I'd say a prayer for you, but I'm not and I can't.So I'll just say to all of you, be safe, be healthy."
"Yes Tim the increase is worrying, seems to coincide with July 1st partys two plus weeks ago and more things opening up.Now I'll go await Dr. Hinshaw's report for today."
"Yes, the recent numbers are very worrying, Tim (and I'm waiting for our Dr. H, too, cruiser... when I opened the youtube window, I was the second one waiting; was that you first? LOL) When your Dr. Bonnie was talking about a worrying ""surge"" in BC cases, she was talking about numbers like 25 ... and our surge had already jumped to 100. Now it's 100 plus per day and has been as high as 165. Soon, Alberta plated vehicles are going to be getting keyed again in BC! I better get another visit in to the grandkids while I still can."
"cruiser/krp, is Dr. Hinshaws report live streamed?Edited: 5:20 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Tim I see your Dr. Henry just announced your numbers up again, not as bad as ours but going in the wrong direction!KRP, just about to log on, still trying to calm down after driving through a storm on the way home from Canmore. Was barely home when the tornado alert went out on the storm I had driven through!!!"
"Never mind my post 12, I found it."
"@Tim, yes, you can see it on youtube, on either the ""Your Alberta"" or ""CPAC"" channels. You don't have to have an account or be logged in (I don't).And they hardly ever start on time! GRRR.Edited: 5:31 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Thanks krp, I originally found youtube but since put My Alberta in my pocket. Does AB publish daily reports even though Dr Hinshaw isn't live?Interesting to note the subtle point making jabs. Premier Horgan points at Alberta numbers, Dr. Hinshaw says ""what BC implemented today we've been doing for months.'We are in a vise here between WA and AB and I'm not feeling good about what we will hear from MOH on today's numbers.I find it interesting, our community numbers now, are as bad as, if not worse than March and April if you removed the isolated “outbreaks” in long term care, processing plants, prisons, foreign farm workers etc.Edited: 6:21 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Yes daily reports are published every day, except weekends. Dr. Hinshaw gives live reports on Tuesdays and Thursdays, although if numbers keep growing she might have to go back to daily!I tend to agree when she said COVID fatigue is setting in."
I know there are many anti science people in Alberta- anti maskers. perpetuated by the right wing nut cases in the USA ie Trump and company. I am just telling the truth.
"Now Edmonton has also announced the requirement for wearing masks similar to Calgary’s move and also effective August 1, so I guess Poster 1 is in trouble."
Interesting tidbit just on the news - some bars and restaurants are reporting business is down 50% over the past couple of weeks compared to the first days after reopening. Hopefully the young folks got the message.
"""I will not be muzzled like a mad dog"". freedom loving Florida man who looked like a mad dog. . (did you see that clip on YouTube)"
"For goodness sake people, just wear a mask when in places where you will be in close contact with other people. This stomping of feet and screaming that you won't let anyone tell you to wear a mask, even if it will save people's lives, seems like a spoiled 10-year old who won't be told what to do.I get that masks aren't perfect, they only prevent 30-50% of transmission (depending on the study), so yes they aren't 100% protective, but even 30-50% protection is hugely beneficial in terms of infections prevented and deaths prevented.The alternative seems to be to not wear masks, allow a huge resurgence of infections, then have to close down the economy again for another month or two. Or we could all just act like adults and wear masks to limit infections, and go on with reopening the economy."
I think the best way to coax fringe nut jobs into wearing a mask would be to tell them masks have been outlawed.
