Hi i was told you can purchase covid insurance when you arrive at Dalaman Airport. Can u please advise if this is true. Thank u
"Hi Marie yes its true,vipfamily posted about it other day cant find what thread it was posted on.John"
"My advice would be to buy a straightforward travel policy here in the UK, they generally cover for up to £5M in medical expenses as well as all illness' personal accidents the usual lost luggage etc etc. The Turkish insurance scheme doesn't even come close this and, for me at least, offers no confidence or reassurance and is not something I would rely on.However the choice is yours and yours alone, if you believe the Turkish scheme is adequate for you needs go right ahead and buy a policy."
"Make sure the Policy you buy in the U.K. covers Covid-19 and also covers, any accommodation for any convalescence and after care if you are not allowed to fly back on your scheduled flight. Also, make sure missed flights are covered too.Some Policies are not covering Covid-19 some will if you bought your insurance before March 2020.Edited: 5:44 am, July 03, 2020 "
Yes i have my own travel ins but doesnt include covid. I was told u can pay for that policy at dalaman airport. Just wanted to know where to go to obtain it. Thanks
"I think I saw somehwere that it's only for people under 65, so no good for us old fogies! I was going to get it as a top up."
"It only covers up to 7000 euros, nowhere near enough if put in icu/need repatriation."
Refunds unlikely.....https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53265841
"It’s also not available in dalaman airport yet , only Istanbul & alanya unless they roll it out over next couple of days. 3 tiers depending on how much you want to spend but not very high monetary coverage €7000 is maximum cover."
