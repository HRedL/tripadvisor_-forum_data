"Hi, making plan for my 1st trip to Europe. Is the price shown on oui.sncf as per departure time the final price, seat reservation included?Thank you."
"The ticket price shown is the final price, including a seat reservation on trains that have reservations. However, the price will go up as the travel date gets closer because the cheapest tickets sell out."
Thank you.
"The exchange & refund, terms & conditions stated : a charge of € 5 from 30 days prior to departure, then € 15 two days prior to departure. From 30 minutes prior to departure, tickets can be exchanged up to two times (for the same day and the same journey), and are non-refundable after the first exchange. Any difference in price between the old and the new ticket will be added to this fee. Ticket cannot be exchanged and is non-refundable after departure.What if i cancel my trip 40 days before the date, am i able to get my refund?"
"It is better to have a stable trip plan before you buy your tickets. If you are able to lock in your dates with confidence, you can often save 80% off the last minute fares.In case of unexpected problems (Covid-19 for example), if it is you who are having the problem, your trip insurance will cover it. If it is France that is having the problem, it will be announced that refunds and exchanges can be made with no penalty."
"#3: ""What if i cancel my trip 40 days before the date, am i able to get my refund?""Yes. Then, as stated, from 30 days to 2 days before it will cost € 5."
"Don't assume travel insurance is going to help with Coronavirus. It may depend on when you bought the coverage, and the reason for the cancellation. Good guide here: https:/…"
"With the beginning of the end of confinement in France (for French residents only at this time) starting May 11th, a lot of people were already complaining that just about all of the trains are showing that they are fully booked.The SNCF has explained that they don't know yet which trains they will be operating, so they are not taking bookings. While a few trains are sure to operate, they hope to add as many as possible according to demand. They have also not determined how seating will be handled in terms of social distancing rules. At best, they will probably only be able to accept 50% capacity, but nothing is certain yet.So if any of you still have plans to try to visit in 2020, you can throw all of rules about booking 3 months ahead of time out the window until further notice."
