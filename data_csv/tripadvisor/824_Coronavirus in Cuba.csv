Does anyone know if elorbenews.com is a reliable source for Cuba news? They appear to be reporting 3 suspected cases of Coronavirus https:/…https:/…
There is this... https:/…
"Never heard of their website but if they are basing their news on the gossip of the neighbours, I doubt that should be regarded as reliable.“Fulano went to eat in an Italian restaurant and is now coughing so he must have coronavirus.”"
Cuba will be the last to ever admit they have corona virus in the island . Johnny C
Johnny...you are a bit of a negative Nelly lately....
"No I’m not .It’s just reality .They want to protect there tourism . I love everything . Johnny CEdited: 9:20 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Whilst I understand Johnny's point, if there were suspected cases of coronoavirus, I think that the authorities would be rounding up all their contacts and testing them. And that would be hard to hide."
hola. Hope not. And it is impossible to control it entering a country as long as borders/shores are open. They know it. Impossible.
Sooner or later they will have one. But as Johnny said I too believe the Cuban government will not disclose any info about it unless they have too.
"just got below quote from a friend who works in one of the medical labs in Santiago: ""many dead from corona virus in China and now it's in Italy, they say it was trump"""
Oh this is scary.... :-(
more likely to get it at a canadian airport than cuba.cuba runs a tight ship. we don't. carol e.
"hola. It is freaky, it seems like just yesterday the virus was only in China. https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.html Cuba not on the map yet."
"hola :) Reply #12, the only way Cuba can stop the the virus from entering Cuba, is to quarantine everybody entering on to the island for, i'll say 28 days. Other than that do you really think that Cuba's airport staff will stop it? ps - tests aren't 100% correct."

Go away troll!
"Update in OntarioWe have 18 cases of Convid-19 in the GTA and York Region . People arriving from Iran will be asked to self isolation for 14 days and report to the health board . I believe they are setting up a check point for them at the airport at sometime this week.There is stock piling for goods , water, toilet tissue and sanitizers, masks.Canadians arriving at Pearson make sure you  sanitize hands, no face touching, and sneeze in your sleeve. Usual rules for cold and flu. We are still at low for catching this virus and prepared more so due to SARS ."
Post 19.Where is this killing hospital?
"Diva, I think it is in a town called Slaughter."
Or in their imagination. Nothing like a scare monger to chear everyone up.
"I'm scheduled to go there in a week, and while I'm not particularly concerned about getting the virus, I am worried about being forced into lockdown / quarantine for 14 days if someone on the plane or at the resort is suspected of having it."
"MyWordsmith, good point. 14 days of isolation off resort would not be fun for anyone in Cuba!I hope you get back without issue."
#25. Me too. I go there on Friday from Mexico.
"MyWordsmith I feel the same, concerned about lockdown/quarantine. I wonder if there's a protocol in place? Thanks"
"hola. i am himmmin and hawwwwin to go. if i go 4 nights and sooner the possibly better. i see the needle of oppertunity to visit, slowly go down as each day passes. when the sun is shinin it feels like everything is gonna be okay. hope the sun keeps shinin. lots of sun in Cuba!"
"ps - it would be the best to keep defragging or keep erasing history in the brain to remove the thought of quarantine in Cuba.Edited: 3:20 pm, March 03, 2020 "
Great point! I agree. We are supposed to be arriving next week; we are cancelling our flights. Will have to be some other time!
Sightseers wins the rationality prize here. I'm not going.
I'm not going to the US either.
There are more flights from Italy to the US - I don't know about Canada. And there are certainly cases there.I guess avoiding all those Canadian airports makes sense - full of germs there. And I guess the Cuba resorts too - full of unhealthy Canadians spreading diseases !!
"The best sanitizer in Cuba is the Sun. The ultraviolet rays and the heat kill coronavirus quickly. It is destroyed at 56 degrees Celsius and up. I am not talking about the air temperature of course, but the surface of the objects exposed to the Sun"
"@12""Mortality rate of coronavirus is 3.4% worldwide — more than double that of the flu. """
"Actually mortality rate is almost 20 times higher than this year's flu (2.5% vs 0.125%). Then again, can we trust the statistics? My numbers were published in ""Lancet"" medical magazine three weeks ago."
We are going to Cuba in April and we are going. The only way we won’t go is if the plane don’t go. People just have to be proactive. Take precautions and a lot of sanitizer.
"hola. beardo, reply #35, your second paragraph, is a good point. For now, here in North America it is still early, but in one two four weeks one two four months, who knows. Hope the world gets it under control, before the world becomes like parts of China Italy and Iran. no bueno. ps - i still smile i still laugh."
"Just arrived home from a week in Cuba (CSM).. we had a great time, but I will say many, many travellers were sick (with cold/cough) - more than previous years. It seemed like almost everyone at our resort had a cold, and there was a lot of coughing, travellers and staff alike. I’m not sure what precautions are actually in place; no one is taking temperatures inbound or outbound, in Cuba or Canada. No one asked about health, it’s the elephant in the room.Remember how important tourism is in Cuba... the impact of closing borders would further devastate the country. Our tour guide mentioned that there is already a ‘hygiene’ crisis in the country, where is it very difficult for common folks to buy soap, detergent, sanitary products. It is not my intention to spread any fear - I love Cuba, it is a wonderful country with warm hearted people. Just be aware that there are always many layers to the truth, and reasons information may be withheld. If you do travel, be smart: bring hand sanitizer, wash your hands before eating. Don’t touch your face, and try not to touch surfaces if you can avoid it (like door handles and bannisters) If you are eating at a buffet, definitely sanitize you’re hands after handling utensils...Edited: 4:03 pm, March 05, 2020 "
Good report R33 thanx Johnny C
"Hola @41We were at the Playa, for two weeks in dec. all six of us got a cold, any many more at the hotel also....it seemed every 3rd person had a cough....Sh-t happens....cheers."
"I've been back from Varadero for almost 3 weeks now, caught a cold or something my last day or two there , ( as did two of my buddies ) still struggling with it, deep cough, hoping it goes away soon as I fly back to Cuba in 2 weeks from now. Don't want any unnecessary problems at the airport."
I guess that an all-inclusive resort might be almost as bad as a cruise ship for the spreading of diseases.
can't believe there have been no reported cases in Cuba given the economic ties with China and the large number of Italian tourists visiting the island...Mind you... I think North America is probably safe as Donald has told the world he has stopped the spread...
Are they still allowing flights in from Italy?
"@41...thanks for the warning :) I can't believe people from Italy are not being screened...it's only a matter of time before the first one lands and it spreads. We all should be screened for the sake of the planeload and the aftermath. Does Cuba even have those temperature guns? Are they ready for it :) What is their plan :) Is there a shortage medicine :) Where they gonna put us :) It doesn't matter, we're all gonna die :)@46-47...we might as well joke about it for now anyway :)"
That's a very good question Vicki...I believe they are and unscreened :) It's a joke if this is really happening...is Cuba trying to get out of the tourist business? :)
This makes me all too nervous and thinking of cancelling my trip. Anyone else thinking of cancelling? I’m pregnant and it was supposed to be a 4 night baby moon but it’s making me more nervous then excited lol.
2 flights arriving today in Cayo Largo from Italy. One from Rome and one from Milan. A little nervous about that.
"Being pregnant , it is not worth the risk to travel.I would cancel , but then who said you are not going to catch it at home?My travel plans have a d will not change .Decided for you and your child.The money you get back will be better spent on the child."
LauraJane040:I agree. I would be nervous too.

@66) I even had to read that one to hubby....lol
I would certainly think that the “ pregnancy hormones “ would make one a little more concerned about a government WARNING about Zika to the unborn child than the current Corona virus ??? Lenny
"hola. well maybe, maybe there will be hand soap available in more washrooms in Cuba. you'd think they'd want that."
"Ughhhh man some of you guys are just brutal.....I’m aware of zika it is listed at a level 2 on the government of Canada website - practise special precaution. It doesn’t state a level 3 - avoid non essential travel. While it is a risk there are precautions I can take to avoid getting bit by a mosquito yes still a risk I get it.

You're very close Johnny :)Nice work grapes...linkless Suzi should've linked that one :)Cuba's always been able to paper things well....they appear to be somewhat ready...lets all hope it's not just good sounding/reassuring words on paper :)
And I can’t see Cuba reacting the way North Korea is reported to be doing.
hola. zika? 2017?
hola. Italy quarantines 16 million. China 60 million. doesn't sound like a common flu. maybe and hope it is a two to seven month visitor with the use of loco quarantines. quarantines seem to be the treatment for now. loco.
Just my opinion but Cuba is not a very forthcoming nation. It survives on tourism. I love the place been there at least a dozen times but heck have also had things stolen and was mugged and left for unconscious right on the resort. Try and find a record of that with your local police lol. They take the report then it hits the black hole. There are areas of Cuba that are frequented by Italians and they are having one of the biggest outbreaks and death tolls needless to say common sense says there are cases on the island......

We leave April 15th. Definitely looking for reliable info as I have copd and am 69.
"# 98...go on Worldometers.info (click on the orange tab at the top that says Coronavirus at the top). You will see all the information on this site to help you make an educated decision for yourself. It updates every few minutes with live information for the entire world. We are booked to arrive in Varadero on April 7th, and out of an abundance of caution along with the fear of being stuck in another country during this ever changing outbreak, we are cancelling for another time. Everyone has to make their own decisions for their own personal reasons. What is a deal breaker for me could very well be a non issue for you. Good luck with your decision!Edited: 9:40 am, March 12, 2020 "
re 98 - a lot can change in 5 weeks.
"Dear TripAdvisor Cuba Friends, On Tuesday, March 10, three cases of COVID-19 were identified in Italian tourists visiting Cuba. Our daily updates from Havana provide more details. As of today, no Cuban has tested positive for Coronavirus. But everything is in flux. My best from Havana, Marcel Hatchhttps:/…"
"#100...Hence the LIVE updates that they can continue to look at to make their decision. You are right though...look where the world was 5 weeks ago....now fast forward to today. Did ANYONE ever think we would be at this place. I didn’t. On a personal level, this terrifies me and everyone that I love and care about. I know there are lots of people who think this is FAKE NEWS, or no big deal...they are entitled to their own opinions and beliefs."
"Personally, given the number of cases in Canada vs Cuba, how much safer are you being in Canada? Sure, the healthcare you receive in Canada may be better than in Cuba (which is arguable since there is no cure to this anyway), but on a chance of getting infected basis, I dont see Canada as being any better than Cuba..."
"@103) the main difference to me would be, I would rather be home and not stuck somewhere else, if something was going to happen....that's not just Cuba, but anywhere."
"I agree that Id rather be at home if I am sick -- but that is the case at all times, 365 days a year with or without Corona... :)The question for me is ""what are the chances of getting sick?"" But of course, to each their own. Everyone must make their own decision."
hola. i would not want to be in or stuck in Cuba if a out break happens. nope. nope. nope.
I stubbed my toe this morning here in Canada..It too was probably Trumps fault ! See how moronic that statement is yet ?
"Cuba finally started announcing cases of Corona brought to the Island by Italians. No kidding just because there are 100k Italians visit the Island go figure. An Australian returned from a Cuba flight a week or two ago and guess what had Corona. Cuba is now drafting everyone to make home made masks! Remember the problem is assembly in large numbers at close quarter hmm resort buffets, airplane etc. It is the people you are around not the country and the people entering Cuba heck some will have the virus! Hope all goes well! Personally, I would be thinking twice about it!"
Iamthe1two That sounds and is in fact an opinion (one persons opinion which is worse) When an opinion can affect a whole country..IT HAD BETTER BE FACTUAL ! It is very plausible that 3 (i heard 4) people went to Cuba and got detected. Are you educated ? Informed ? Slightly intelligent ?For the record..Every country (Started) to announce at one time !
https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/nation/…
"For us it was not only what are the chances of getting sick but the potential consequences, so yes we could get sick on holiday anytime and occasionally we have but we don't end up in isolation or quarantine, with 2 kids in tow that's our main worry :/"
"You definitely did the correct thing, Alison."
"Thanks Bellagio, we are sad and worried for the Cuban people losing income with all the cancellations :("
"Yes Alison, there will be other times to go with far less to worry about. Me, I'm just waiting until the last moment to make a final decision about still going. I'm in no rush as I haven't yet booked my flight to Holguin. In the meantime, everything is still in flux, and prices will continue to drop for my benefit should I decide to go later in April by booking 1 week out from departure. It's all a wait-and-see for me....Terry"
"Terry absolutely, I know you have your wife and family to get to, I hope you can go."
"Well... it's not the end of the world if I can't go. I've only targeted April 18th so I can be there for my other Cuban kinda-sorta adopted daughter's quinceanera celebration. I've also promised to pay for the professional photographer and the booze for the party, but I can always just tell my wife to go to the bank and yank some money with her credit card to pay for those things for me. The birthday girl can wait a bit longer for my birthday gift I imagine. I'm really on the fence right now, Alison. We'll see how it shakes out.Terry"
7 cases and one of them is seriously ill and he is risking his life hanging on a pulmonary respirator in the Pedro Kourí Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana.
"Three more cases in Cuba, bringing the total to 10. Apparently these are in Villa Clara and Trinidad. Also the very sad news is that one of the Italian men first infected has died"
My friend is fuming and says their government should stop all flights coming in. It's the tourists that have brought the virus in to Cuba.
"HolaVery disappointing to hear the lasted update.Sadly, there have also been many Cubans returning home to Cuba recently after having worked abroad for many months that may have an impact on future events.CheersEdited: 1:56 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Bellagio i agree with your friend when she says the tourista are the ones that brought that virus but i guess the tourist dollars are way more important then the health of there own people .We also can say the same for Canada and many other countries its people that were on vacation that brought the Virus home and god knows how long it will take for this nightmare to go away ,"
I'm sad right now but not surprised. It's only gonna get worse I'm afraid :(
Stopping the tourists would only work if they stopped returning Cubans as well or enforced quarantines. That did not happen. I think that two of the 10 confirmed are Cubans who seem to have got infected from family members who came from Europe.
"Unfortunately, the number of cases rises to 10.And the Italian who was in danger of life hospitalized in the Instituto de Medicina Tropical ""Pedro Kourí"" of the capital died early this morning (Cuba time).The 3 new cases concern people from different countries (two Cubans and a tourist). 10 people who came into contact with this case have been isolated and are under control.There should be 389 people hospitalized for checks, considered suspicious cases, including 147 foreigners and 242 Cubans, to which are added 24,853 people in quarantine, but in their homes."
An 11th confirmed case was reported - a Canadian in Holguín.
"The Canadian is 57 (or 56?). He arrived true the Holguín airport on the 14th and went to the Paradisus Rio de Oro where he saw the resort's doctor on the 16th complaining of symptoms associated with the virus. He was put in quarantine at the hospital and those in close contact with him were also quarantined and have no symptoms (as of the 8pm news today).It just happened that my partner and I were at the Paradisus from the 14th to the 16th. Chances that we were infected are really low as we had no contact with anyone else then my friends who were there for the week. But still, we will apply social distancing and avoid crowed places. And of course, my partner being Cuban and , like most Cubans , he's a bit hypochondriac... His runny nose is now turning into a way bigger deal then it should be... ;-p"
I heard from a Cuban friend today that Club Amigo Atlantico in Guardalavaca has a case plus a few others in isolation.
"Dear Cuba Friends, We've updated the cases of COVID-19 in Cuba today. Hopefully, there will be none tomorrow, Marcel Hatchhttps:/…"
Just refresh this map and it will show you World wide where the virus count is currently at. https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Stay home and avoid contact with the outside World to stay healthy!

"@131 I just can't believe I just read this on the website that opened from your link:""Wednesday, March 18. A 57-years-old Canadian arrived in Holguín on March 14. He stayed at the Río de Oro Hotel in Guardalavaca. He presented symptoms on March 16, and tested positive for COVID-19 today. He is in isolation, together with six direct contacts.""Why people still want to go away in these times? What's the reason? To get sick the very nice people on this gorgeous Island and put everyone else at risk in your way there? Why are people soooo selfish? Why people can't understand that you might not show any symptoms but infect looooots of other people around you? Imagine that this person was in contact with people in the Canadian airport at departure, people in his plane down to Cuba, people at the Airport of arrival in Cuba and many more after that in his way to the resort and at the resort. They can't even trace all the people that this one person has been in contact from the moment he left his house in Canada and until he was tested positive. Now, imagine that this is just one person, multiply that by thousands of people that don't think about anyone except of themselves and go out there and get sick God knows how many people! Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!UNTIL EVERYONE IS STARTING TO DO THEIR PART AND STAY AWAY AND NOT SPREADING THIS VIRUS, IT WILL TAKE FOREVER TO WIN THE BATTLE WITH THIS VIRUS! PLEEEASE EVERYONE, JUST BE SMART AND LETS FIGHT THIS THING TOGETHER! Stay home and protect yourself, your loved ones and everyone else in your neighborhood!"
"#135 totally agree with you. I have ran the PRDO Facebook site for many years now, over that time we have had situations good bad and terrible, but this is far far the worse. I am aware of 10 members of staff, although they are not showing any symptoms are in isolation under going tests at hospital. The other fact is on the day this guy arrived on the 14th, the same plane did a turn around back to Canada, doubt a deep clean and sanitation was complete and thorough. The Melia are doing everything they possibly can and are updating us directly so notices can be put on the site. What a total utter nightmare for not just Cuba but the World. The spread of this is so contagious and no vaccine, this is what is making this the pandemic it is. We all need to be responsible , social distancing, if you do not need to go out, don't. Prevention is better than cure ...only there is no cure!!! Take care folks Stay safe x"
"@ 135 & 136.....well said! My husband and I have not travelled in the last month, but we are at home and staying put. Our trip to Cuba leaving March 30th was cancelled by the airline.....just as well. My husband’s work is indefinitely shut down. I am retired. We both strongly believe that isolation right now is the key, otherwise the numbers will be sky high and the situation critical. Everyone needs to focus on self-isolating ......we are using this time to get busy on spring-cleaning the house and finishing up all the little household projects that were left incomplete. If everyone does their part, the sooner we will all get through this."
You're well said also @137 :) Let us all pray and do our parts :) We need to be done with this virus asap. I was thinking of disinfecting everything I touched since yesterday again :)
its true comming from a american born in the u.s with three children in cuba cuba will never admit there is a problem with no closing there borders or having any at all medication on the island interferon is a hoax not for coronavirus if not the united states will have it secrecy and ideology and tourism dollars are alll they want beware dont travel to cuba my children and wife are self quarantine and if god willing everything will be allright but if you travel to cuba be aware of being quarantied in a no higenic place and being stranded or something else
"I just got this email from my friend in Havana, ""My mother worries me there in Villa Clara there are many cases of coronavirus and she arrives by bus with a 5-hour trip on the 25th. That bus to complete the passage in Santa Clara, the capital of the province. It's very dangerous."""
"Canada one, there are officially 3 cases (I think) in Santa Clara. The rest are on preventive isolation. Not more or less dangerous then anywhere else.The only safe place is at home, with no one coming in."
