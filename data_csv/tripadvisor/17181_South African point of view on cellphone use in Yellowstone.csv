Interesting article on the epidemic.…news24.com/Explore/Bush/yellowstones-cellph…
"Interesting article, but did I miss the link to the map.With Verizon, I had a lot of coverage in the park - more than last time. A ranger at Colter Bay said their goal (and/or they were considering) to have maps and hiking info available online AWAY from the visitors centers. So as the article said, limiting coverage at the road and at visitor centers but increasing coverage in the backcountry. That's an interesting proposition.^^^Obviously, that's a reference to GTNP and not YNP.Edited: 3 years ago "
