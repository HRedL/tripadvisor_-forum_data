What is the condition of the island with regard to supplies? We are supposed to head that way Wednesday and we are making sure.
Probably going to be another panic hoard run due to the 2 new cases there.
"You can get food no problem. There has been heavy buying in Costco and Wal-Mart, yesterday was very, very busy. Certain things you can't get at least as of yesterday and that would be hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol. Lots of disinfectant cleaners also missing from shelves. I haven't been to my regular grocery store in a week but will be going tomorrow morning. I'll be interested in seeing what's available there!!"
"We shopped on Thursday evening and pretty much everything was in stock, but I know there was a big run yesterday due to rumors that Matson was going to stop shipping to the islands (not true). So it might be much more picked over, especially with 2 vacationers bringing the virus here."
That was weird Jen because I didn't hear that rumor until I saw it on the evening news last night. I thought it was due to the lasted prez news conference.
I doubt anyone will be going by Wednesday.
"Aloha from Kaua’i!We went to Costco today to do our usual shopping - there were not many people comparatively (they have a limit on how many people can be in the store at one time)....got all we needed BUT of course due to the panic hoarding of toilet paper - none anywhere - paper towels were almost gone also.We didn’t buy a whole lot more than normal - but we did buy multiples of things we like such as the plant based Better Burgers.I guess we’ll look at Long’s, Big Save and Sueoka tomorrow for TP.Malama Pono,Janet"
Thanks so much Janet.
With all of this closing I'm surprised we're not hearing about the restaurants closing up? At least I haven't read it here on this forum. What I found on a trip this week was just that - restaurants were all open despite events and public venues being closed. Just seems ironic to me.

"Starbucks in US and in Canada plans to implement ""to go"" only mode.https://www.azfamily.com/news/us_world_news/…"
"Colorado here. Shopping was like a war zone today. No bread, eggs, very little milk limited to one gallon purchase. No chicken or ground beef to be had. Guess we are having fish tacos this w eek. no potatoes, onions or bananas. Very few cold meds,no toilet paper , paper towels, at four stores I visited. Don't understand the boarding mentality."
"Wow, that's crazy. Hope you can get groceries etc. as you need them, Kadey."
"People that are having a hard time getting food , wow that’s scary, maybe look into Home Chef or Blue Apron or one of those services. Supposedly our Safeway was almost bare 36 hours after I went shopping Thursday when it was totally stocked. Let’s all give the checkers and baggers our patience. They are dealing with a lot ."
"That msg for those on the mainland, Blue Apron etc. Try Instacart on Kauai. That could be really helpful especially for those that shouldn’t be going out. I put an order in today and the soonest I could get it delivered was the 24th. Usually it’s the next day. https:/…lihue-hi"
"Are you in Colorado, or you are ""Colorado"" reporting from Kauai? If you would be so kind as to clarify. Thank you!"
"Kadycat is in Colorado reporting on the Kauai forum about conditions in Colorado.Edited: 5:41 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Thank you fishdiva. We have just decided to cancel our trip that was set for the 18th to the north shore. So hard, but with all this new information, it is the right think to do for the people of Hawaii. Stay safe family!"
Your welcome jimdandyofor. You made the right decision. Thanks for being so sensible!!
We were at Costco earlier today. There was a lot of food but none of some items- no potatoes or onions but lots of other fresh produce. They had a limit of one container of milk and eggs. The lines were incredibly long but moved right along. People were polite and focused. The rain was torrential when we left the store. Again everyone made space for each other as they rearranged and covered groceries to head for cars or waited for a car to pull up and let them load near the entry. Wish this made the news!
"Bars, restaurants, theaters, beauty shops, bowling alleys, you name it are all closed in Washington and Oregon. My kids trip to the Cook Islands was just cancelled. I doubt we will be going on our vacation either. It is just crazy all over! Best to ride out the storm at home. I don't want to go on vacation and not even be able to go to a restaurant or have a drink. Take out food only in Oregon."
"I hear you, LoveMahaulepu. There are plenty of great stories to go around. Unfortunately, it doesn't sell the news. Not ""scintillating"" enough. As my parents, who survived WW2 in Europe always said, ""This too shall pass"".Edited: 1:12 am, March 17, 2020 "
"So are you on Kauai or in California, Love?People on Maui are polite too....but it doesn't change the facts.2 cases in the whole state less than a week ago. 10 today.Please, please....cancel trips to Hawaii. Give us all a chance.Edited: 1:16 am, March 17, 2020 "
I’m on Kauai. The Costco in Lihue. Thanks for asking for clarification. I was at Seuoka’s Grocery store in Koloa and pulled out a wipe to clean my hands after shopping. The lady who had waited on me at cash register pulled out a big bottle of hand sanitizer and made sure I had enough to clean my hands. Such kindness is a large part of what I love about Kauai.
Please don't encourage people to visit.You are jeopardizing the very people you like.
"I get your point. I don’t want to jeopardize anyone on Kauai. My understanding is that there are lots and lots of travel cancellations and more expected by hotels, property managers."
"The Bay Area, which has 3 airports and a lot of flights daily to Kauai and the other islands, was put on a mandatory lockdown today. One the provisions is no unnecessary travel. Hopefully that order coming out will bring it home to people that now is not the time to travel. We aren’t supposed to leave our homes unless to: grocery shop, pick up prescriptions, doctor appointments and outdoor exercise keeping a distance of 6 ft from other people. That’s it. Dentists are even canceling routine check ups. Restaurants are take out only, almost all other businesses are closed."
"What is the info on closing restaurants, bars, shops or beaches and parks? We’re supposed to arrive on the 20th. ( our town only has 3 cases). We didn’t want to get there for 10 days and end up being quarantined to our condo..."
"Most of the beach parks are closing down. It's a very fluid situation so what is happening today may not be what happens tomorrow. Lots of folks practicing social distancing and taking all precautions, I don't know of any restaurants closing at this time but do know there is a lot of ""take out"" going on.If you get sick and test positive for the virus you won't be quarantined in your condo."
"fishdiva, what does closing down the beach parks mean? No sitting on the sand and going in the water? Or does it mean just the pavilions at the county beach parks."
"Love, it's great to hear positive stories about people helping each other."
"At this point I would say about half of the restaurants here are operating with limited hours and take-out, tough to tell for sure as much is dependent on coconut wireless and social media posts. All of the farmers markets and sunshine markets are closed, stores are starting to close and I know the boat operators are planning to shutter operations soon if they already haven't. Hiking will be awful and muddy given the feet of rain we are currently receiving, and the Kalalau Trail will probably be closed. And brown water at the beaches will be a problem once the rain stops too."
"So today we did a little shopping to prep to go home. This is what we found:Walmart has most everything except for TP and sanitizersCostco had a sign posted with what they’re out of. Same stuff- TP sanitizer, plus they’re out of spamHome Depot looked like business as usual. All stores were quieter than I’ve seen for a while. 2 days ago Big Save in Koloa had most everything except the big 2 TP and sanitizers. Restaurants are mostly open as far as I have seen. Quieter, more single use stuff. Not sure what it will be like in a few more days"
All State Parks are closing today until further notice.
"Aloha from Kaua’i!After another futile trip to some stores today - yet no TP!You have to be at the store at exactly the time the shelves are restocked - if you aren’t - you are out of luck.There is definitely panic purchasing and hoarding here.Malama Pono,Janet"
