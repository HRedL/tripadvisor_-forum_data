"Any updates regarding h1n1 epidemic in maldives, as of April 1, 2017? Is it controlled? How about in hulhumale?"
The latest information posted on the forum advised travellers to avoid visiting Male. If you're travelling to a resort island you won't need to go to Male at all as the airport is based on another island and transfers to resorts depart from there.
Thank you for the info
"Travel advice from Maldives:Capital Male’ and Velana International Airport being two different islands your Maldives holiday does not seem risky at this point of time. However, as a precaution we suggest the following.• Wear surgical mask while passing through the airport.• Maintain personal hygiene and use hand sanitizer.• Prevent visiting capital Male’ during this period unless absolutely necessary.• We also recommend resorts to offer hand sanitizer to all guests, right on the jetty as guests are welcomed. Any suspicious case must be referred to resort clinic without delays.• Though H1N1 is risky on children and elderly we do not recommend interrupting your resort holiday plans yet as every Maldives resort is geographically secluded from rest of the islands. Past experiences indicate chances of epidemics spreading in Male’ moving on to resorts are slim. Maldives resorts are often very pro-active through direct coordination with Ministry of Tourism.• There has been no confirmed case from any local residential island. For precaution we suggest to avoid taking children and elderly to local islands. Holidays in local guest houses recommended only to adults during this period."
So this above notice confirms that H1N1 flu is restricted only to Male. Has not yet affected airport area or Hulhumale. Even local islands too are safe till now.Edited: 3 years ago 
"Good to know. Coz my wife is pregnant, higher risk of getting this flu..thanks anyway."
If your wife is pregnant I would be more worried about Zika
Oh is it? Hows zika in maldives? Need to buy those mosquito reppelant then.. thank you for your concern.
"Alfie, there are a couple of recent threads about Zika Virus in The Maldives which I'd highly recommend you check out before planning a trip there whilst your wife is pregnant. You can search for them using the search bar at the top of the list of questions on the forum."
some people enjoy a risk ... better run this plan by your wife ...
Even with repellent it is still possible to get bitten by mosquitoes as I can personally testify. Resorts fog regularly to keep the mosquito population down but it is not fail safe. You mention Hulhumale in your original post which is a suburban area and does not get fogged at all to my knowledge. If you were intending to stay there the chance of being bitten by mosquitoes is even higher and the airport itself definitely has mossies flying around.
Has any case of Zika been detected in Hulhumale or local islands?Edited: 3 years ago 
"according to the CDC , yes https:/…zika-virus-maldives"
"Yes, we'll be staying at hulhumale for 1 night and head straight to centara ras fushi in the morning.. thank you guys for all your infos, we really appreciate it.. need to be aware of all of this..."
"@Spammie, thanks for sharing the link. But I had already read the CDC report earlier, but could nowhere find any mention of the specific areas or islands in Maldives affected by Zika. I would guess whole of Maldives where we might be exposed to mossies has the potential to cause Zika infection."
