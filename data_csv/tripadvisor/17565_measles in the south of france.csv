I have a trip planned in 3 weeks with my then 7 week old baby & just wondering what the measles outbreak update is?
"The South of France covers a large area, roughly from Bordeaux to Nice. You'll need to be more specific. It there is a measles outbreak it won't make the front page of the papers anyway."
"In thenews papers here it is just saying south of France, we were planning on flying into Nice and driving aound a radius of about 300km from there. I have tried google to get if there is a problem in a specific area and keep getting just south France."
"Alpes-de-Haute-Provence departement is the main area and people affected are college /university age students. There have been about 500 cases[not sure if these were all confirmed] in the area out of 150,000 people and vaccine failure is suspected so boosters are being givenEdited: 9 years ago "
Found this when I was doing a search on boosters. I hope you're also checking with your pediatrician. Good luck.…cnn.com/2011/…
my teenage son is supposed to get IgG prophylaxis if there is an epidemic or if he is in contact with a variety of diseases incl measles - but it isn't considered necessary at the moment in Nice.
I've just returned from the Languedoc - Specifically Herault - and several of our friends or their children have it/have had it in that area.
Hi Any idea how this area is fairing now since the measles outbreak?
Hi How was it taking your baby in April? Did you find yourself worrying about the baby getting exposed to the measles or did it seem relatively ok? Any information would be greatly appreciated and where you actually travelled as well in the south of france.THanks
Hi I meant to add to the above post that we will be traveling to Paris on Thursday with our 3 kids. Our baby is 10 months old and has not received the MMR yet due to her age. Thus we are worried about measles exposure for her...We will go to Avignon first via train Paris then to Villefranche sur mer then to Roussillon and Gordes in Provence.Thanks for any help you can provide!!
"folks, this is an issue that needs the opinion of a qualified medical professional with access to the medical records for YOUR family, not a bunch of strangers scattered around the world without a medical qualification or certificate amongst the bunch of them.Talk to YOUR doctors and get their professional opinion about what you and your family should do.. they have access to international health information and the education and knowledge to make a recommendation tailored to your family's individual requirements.Everything else is just noise."
OK thanks.I think it's a valid question to ask people what their experience was in France. I'm not asking for medical advice on this forum as I have discussed it with our pediatrician already. I wanted to hear from other travelers. I'm sorry to have bothered you with this matter.
Is there a travel clinic (with doctors/nurses) you can contact where you live? They usually have the most current disease epidemiology information and recommendations.
Some information regarding measles shot/your baby. Perhaps print this and take it to your doctor.…cdc.gov/travel/…measles.htm
