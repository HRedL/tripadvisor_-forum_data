"What would be nice for this forum is to have a few locals from Orlando or even the state of Florida just keep those wanting to travel to the area a update. Things like 1. what the corona count is and in what direction it's headed.2. What's now open and what restrictions are they under.3. What's not opened and what looks like may never be again.4. How shopping for simple groceries is like. Mask or no mask?5. Cost of things , have they increased cause of this virus?6. How's the crime/still safe to stay everywhere?This is just a small list of topics they could update daily.Sure would be nice to get the news from someone right there living there other then assumptions from those from the UK or other places."
Good idea would be good to have an insight especially with the situation at the moment!
"You can bookmark and check various websites yourself. Some rules are statewide, some are for a specific county or even a specific city. It's not that easy to keep up with what you are asking. https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/coronavirus/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/https://www.tampabay.com/coronavirus/"
You want daily updates from a local because your vacation was cancelled. Unbelievable. Donna was very nice to give you resources.
No octoberitaly.The OP has NOT had their holiday cancelled. You might want to read some of their other posts on this forum.They are not in the least bit interested in Orlando I can assure you.
"It is a good idea because while things can open, it doesn't mean that things are open. Restaurants were allowed to open Monday, but there are a number that haven't opened and some of those are still carry out only. We went to 3 different restaurants yesterday before finding a Mexican restaurant that was open for dining. As for shopping, The Fresh Market and Whole Foods are requiring a face covering. Others are not, but you will see quite a few at Publix and Walmart. Non-Essential stores have to limit customers to 25%. Publix doesn't limit, but Walmart does and you may have to wait outside. Prices don't seem to have changed. Gas seemed to bottom out. It was around 1.70 a gallon in Seminole yesterday. The forecast is it will go up. Not sure they were paying people to take oil, but what can you do?Crime never stops. It wasn't in the news much, but now it is starting to get back to being news again."
Is that a blast from the past you mean? Also thanks Sunngod. Nice of you to update.
I just paid $1.64 a gallon for gas not an hour ago in Seminole county.
Sunngod. The fact that it took you three restaurants before you got to sit down says it all.
"But Fluffy, had I gone to the first restaurant to begin with...To their defense, it was only Monday that they were allowed to open. What it looks like to me is that some restaurants like fast food places like the idea that they don't have to clean a seating area and it is easier for them to do drive through only. Some seen irritated by the 25% rule. I mean a 20 table restaurant can only use 5. That makes it hardly better than none at all. Was in GA over the weekend and they allow 50%. Pretty much all of them were open except chic fil a, but I think they are killing it with drive through only anyway."
"Statewide, Phase 1 Recovery/Reopening began on Monday allowing restaurants, in store retail, and libraries/museums to open indoors at 25% occupancy. In Osceola (Kissimmee), a 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was lifted. An order for mandatory face coverings continues. Pertinent to a travel forum, some weeks ago, the Governor signed an executive order banning vacation rentals (exceptions including essential personnel and rentals more than 30 days). It was initially 2 weeks, then extended, and now until further notice. Yesterday, Disney announced the planned opening of Shanghai Disneyland which may give some glimpse for other worldwide parks. Despite the Phase 1 allowance, the Disney World site was adjusted to specifically say Disney Springs remains closed for all Guests at this time. Their wording is ""a reopening date has not been identified"". Universal's site reads ""Universal Orlando Resort is temporarily closed through at least May 31st""."
"Traveller, You know what they say about assuming.It makes a azz out of you. I actually had a week vacation at the Marriott Lakeshore reserve planned for end of April that i cancelled and was able to move and upgrade for a price to the week of Dec19-26. Hmmm not a wee bit interested in Orlando... WRONG again , the state of Florida is like a second home to me, been at least 50 vacations to the state of Florida over the years and stayed at approx 25 different places in the Orlando area. Yes it was nice of Donna to post the newspaper resources but they are usually late to post up to date info.Plus are one sided jouralism at it's best some times. Would be nice to ,get actual day reports from those that actually live there is all i'm saying, First hand/front line info! There are some from florida?orlando area here almost everyday, wouldn't take much just to get all of us foreigners a quick update without having to search for it.Edited: 10:55 pm, May 06, 2020 "
", Tks 1031 Orlando. Info straight to the point without spending a hour having to look for it. Just cause some here think i'm rude too dam bad, i tell it like it is . Can't take the truth simple then don't read what i write.btw.. tks to others for their input as well. Maybe Traveller you need to add to a topic for once rather than don't take the bait?Edited: 6:14 pm, May 06, 2020 "
"Traveller from UK Sorry to prove you wrong again in your assumption, I think you best to just listen as your post makes you sound Yumm? won't say it.Btw .. I was booked for a vacation into the Marriott lakeshore reserve at end of April that i cancelled and was actually able to rebook for Dec19 to 26 for a slight upgrade in price. It still remains 100% refundable if i cancel 48hrs ahead of time. We drive always so no flight necessary. Also just to let you know i make the state of Florida like my second home and have had at least 40 vacations in the state, and stayed at many different places/ Orlando per say at least 25 times over the years.  So maybe i suggest you trying to actually add to a post for once rather then complaining ,"
You don’t want to stay at a Hilton?
"Thanks for the information. I will need to travel to Orlando during the first week of July for business and it is very helpful to keep up on how things evolve in the meanwhile, so I can continue with or change my plans as needed. Thanks again. I will be traveling all the way from Costa Rica with my wife and we are concern about our health an safety... I will like to know if stores like Ross, Burlington, Marshalls are up and running right now. Also if the Outlet Malls are open with stores doing business"
"It's a nice idea to have a constantly updated thread. But IMHO most folks have specific questions, regarding their particular interests. That said, here's the scoop from Ormond Beach (80 min away):1. Corona count: Google is your friend. Increments daily for various counties.2. Same as #1. Regs just changed, 3. Hard to say what's going under. That'll probably change week by week. No indication that many places here in Ormond are going under... but again... that may change as time wears on and future biz prospects become clearer. I'd say that the percentage of restaurants that are clearly not reopening is a couple of %.4. Shopping is similar to before. Most folks are wearing masks. Some stores like Winn Dixie have plexiglass screens at the checkout registers. Most stores have 6 ft. spacing rules and many stores have made alternating aisles one-way. Stores are well stocked (here, at least). The only things typically in short supply that I've found are TP and disinfectants like rubbing alcohol & hand sanitizer.5. No change in prices - except gas getting significantly cheaper, like everywhere. $1.75/gal. today.6. No change in crime that I can sense. Seems like if anything, folks are more pleasant and sociable at the grocery store and gas station."

"1. what the corona count is and in what direction it's headed.The curve has not yet flattened.2. What's now open and what restrictions are they under.None of the tourist attractions are open. Most restaurants are still curbside pickup only. Many hotels remain closed. Most beaches are open except in South Florida. The Keys are still restricting entry to residents and people with a good reason to be there (workers and deliveries)3. What's not opened and what looks like may never be again.Bars are still closed. Hair salons, spas, and nail salons are closed. Hard to tell what might not reopen.4. How shopping for simple groceries is like. Mask or no mask?Many stores want masks. It's county to county and store to store. Grocery stores have plenty of snacks and beer. Meat is becoming in short supply. Other items are hit and miss.5. Cost of things , have they increased cause of this virus?Not enough to notice. Fuel is down.6. How's the crime/still safe to stay everywhere?Uptick in domestic violence and petty crimes like shoplifting. Nothing a tourist would notice. But nothing for tourists to do. They pretty much aren't welcome at this point."
Is that some type of a record for posts removed?:o)
"I should also add that while restaurants can be open with 25% capacity, most aren't bothering and are still just carry out. Every museum in the Central Florida area that I can think of remains closed."
"JaimeLobo Yes nice to see someone from Trip advisor remove the foolish post from ignorant posters , We all know where their from. Please there is no need to just answer the questions i had, anyone else please ask or add the questions that they might feel that are important. Like i said before i thank all from Florida for their info. we are all going through a tough time and i like others see this as a spot where we can come and get the truth and up to date info for the area that we wish to travel to hopefully in the near future."

Anyone that is reading this post as well just saw on another post here on this forum that Disney Springs is starting to reopen on May20th. It's only a limited amount of places to open. WDW post.
"SOME of the non-Disney owned businesses at Disney Springs will be opening. They need to comply with the regulations which require social distancing and 25% of maximum capacity. Many of the shops will remain closed as there won't be enough foot traffic to bother opening. Some of the bars and restaurants will do the same, as they simply can't make enough profit to justify opening. I'm pretty sure that AMC and Splitsville are both still mandated to stay closed, and to my knowledge, Disney is not scheduling any entertainment.Bottom line, I wouldn't get too excited about Disney Springs, and I certainly wouldn't book a holiday around it."
There is a place on the Butler Chain called Butler Boat Rental. You need to have a valid boating certificate before you can rent.
Tks lovescabs Nice of you for your input. Would be nice to get other reports besides just Disney. Too many on this forum think that's the only business Orlando has.Maybe some Florida business owners can just pipe in that they are now open for business and what restrictions if any they have?
"Snapchat shots of people on Clearwater beach is positive, didnt seem to have masks on or be that far apart. Things in Florida must be good, so glad. Stay safe."
Victoria- Florida is 8th highest among 50 states for coronavirus cases and Snapchat does not really give the whole picture. People should be wearing masks and social distancing but that’s not what you describe from your Snapchat. I would not say all is well.
Victoria - Snapchat - seriously. ??
"We've heard so much rubbish about plastic cubicles on beachs keeping people apart it was nice to see beach full of people, posts of cocktails being consumed whilst sitting on beach. It looked so normal, felt like light at end of tunnel. No offence was meant, stay safe."
Stay safe Victoria. Just watch your sources. Orlando Sentinel or WDW news today might be better sources than Snapchat.

And where are you reading that they are mandatory? They aren’t required in any store I’ve been to.
"Yeah, as Tenni said, nothing mandatory for the state, some stores may decide individually to have a various restrictions (masks, number allowed in at a time, etc.), Personally, I haven't seen this anywhere. In fact, in my last Publix run, I think there was less mask-wearing than I have seen."

I see we have an influx of pirates. Wonder what the collective noun could be?
"Osceola was mandatory. I don't know if it still is. Orange is NOT.Disney Springs will require them per their own website, but this is their own rule.City Walk will require them per their own website. They are also in Orange County, but adding additional restrictions on their own. They are probably both doing this as a test as it will be exceptionally difficult to keep a six foot distance under normal circumstances."
Looks like Piratemate123 was forced to walk the plank and a new Piratemate has climbed aboard!
Disney is in Orange. As soon as you get outside of Disney on 192 it is Osceola.
Fluffy I could tell you what the collective name is but it would be removed and I would be arrested
