"So Venice is part of the lockdown until April 3rd, Im supposed to be flying there on the 13th April. What’s people’s views on the lockdown being extended past the 3rd?? I don’t really want to get to then not knowing if I’m coming or going, sooner look for an alternative. I feel for the people there now and the ones who should be going shortly just left in limbo unsure what there next step is over claiming money back. A lot of it can’t be helped but airlines / holiday companies should be issuing up to date information on what the customer should do next"
I suggest an extension of the 'lockdown' will depend on how the coronavirus epidemic is developing which is a great unknown.
Hi LeighBy the end of march we will probably know better how the situation will evolve. By then you'll have more details to make the best decision
No one knows whether the Lockdown will be extended.
I am the same due to fly the 4th ! Wish they would cancel it and give me refund

We are also due to fly on 13 April but that's off the cards for us now. I'm just waiting to see how things progress as if fco advises against travel we'll be able to claim costs back on travel insurance. But we will have to be patient. We're in uncharted territory here so noone knows what will happen.

"As with my other posts, the question you really need to be asking is what will the position be in Leicester in a month’s time."
Thanks Raffaele - I was really looking forward to my visit to Venice but I feel so bad for the people of Venice who have been through so much already. I guess we need to keep things in perspective - this is just one holiday for us but the impact on people's lives and livelihoods in Venice and across the Veneto and Lombardia is enormous. Fingers crossed it is over soon.
"Hi there, In case it helps anyone, we weren't due to travel until 13 April, but just called our insurer now on the off-chance and they have accepted our claim. I was really just calling to ask if we have to wait until after 3 April to see what the update is, but they said there is no end date on the FCO guidance so we are covered.The next challenge will be getting a cancellation invoice from easyjet, which will no doubt take some time, but let's see. Hope you all get your trip to Venice at some point soon.L"
Thank you for this...really useful. We’re due to fly on 6th April with Jet 2 and were holding off til 3rd but will now get in touch with our insurers.
Glad to help. Hope you get things sorted.
Flight was cancelled for 26th april
I am sorry DgdHopefully you can get your money back and consider to postpone your trip if you wish
Little or no hope of visiting Venice in April 2020. More like April 2021 before Venice returns to something close to normality.I would not make any bookings before the situation becomes much clearer.
I really have a great difficulty in understanding why even ask this question as to going to Venice or Italy which at the present is one of the worst countries in the world. This is not over for quite some time actually until there is a vaccine.Italy is not going away it will be there next year and the year after. Are you seriously willing to risk your life for hundreds of $ or even thousands of $.Just be wise and be patient
"the question was asked in March 08 Italy is locked down to May 04 of this year who knows when borders will be reopened and safe to travel to Italy I would think the summer season in Italy is a right off.Edited: 12:07 pm, April 12, 2020 "
Or...write off?
