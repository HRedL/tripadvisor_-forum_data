"We're supposed to be flying out tomorrow and we're not sure if we should go considering the newly discovered case today. We're not so worried about the disease itself, we're more concerned about:1. The city shutting down like northern Italy2. People not in the mood3. Chance of quarantine in Barcelona4. Chance of Quarantine when we go back to our country, if something erupts in Barcelona.I'm sure you won't be able to answer #3 and #4 but feedback regarding #1 and #2 will be helpful.Thanks"
"Have planned travel to Barcelona in a couple weeks. Because it's just one isolated case right now, I don't think people are in full panic mode yet and there are no official policies/procedures/travel advisories. The next few days will provide these answers, if it spreads through Barcelona/Spain extremely suddenly like it did in Italy. Otherwise, we have no idea. Let's hope for the best!Edited: 1:31 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"1. Not at this time, based on one case. 2. Do you mean that the city will go quiet? Again, not likely based on one case. But you will not find anyone at this time being able to rule out additional cases. 3. See above. 4. Your government is monitoring the situation closely. If you fall ill after returning home, there is an expectation that you will self identify to the local public health authority. In turn, they will screen you for the virus. According to open source info, Israel is already dealing with a number of deaths due to seasonal flu: https:/…"
Thank you! I hope it works out alright.

"Re Post 2, since when has Barcelona been in Israel?I am due to travel to the City and a neighbouring Town in May and am conscious of the situation in the Catalonia region. It appears that any changes to routine are not necessary at the present time.EnjoyAnthony K"
"@Anthony K: If you are referring to the last comment, I am simply noting the concurrent threat from influenza that has been largely overlooked by commentators. In this particular case the initial question was posed by an individual who reports being resident in Israel. Enjoy your trip."
"I'm pretty worried. My trip is in 1 month and like you, I'm more worried about being quarantined over seas. My toddler is staying in the US and this was a trip for me and my husband. If there is a chance I will get stuck, we will be cancelling and out about $3500. My travel insurance specifically says it does not cover epidemics :("
"Here are some stats that cover age, sex and existing conditions of cases and deaths: https:/…"
"We'll be in Barcelona on March 3rd - what timing, eh? Then Valencia, another key city and then, guess where? Madrid! First time in Europe, wedding anniversary celebration. Planned everything out in September. What are you gonna do? Go, hope for the best and bubble wrap ourselves during the 11 hour flight. Keep repeating the mantra: ""don't touch your face, don't touch your face, don't touch your face."" Also, don't touch ANYTHING at the airport or on the plane, and wipe down your seating area AND bring your own food. Let's all keep our fingers crossed for safe and insanely fun vacation(s).Edited: 1:46 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Dror,Here everything is fine. I have not encountered panic, bad mood or even a single masked person (although there are probably a few).Of course, no one can promise you that everything will go smoothly but that's true for every visit and if you'll need to be quarantined for some reason it's better to do it at home than abroad but that's true to any other problem you might have while on vacation (like an injury)."
"I am due to leave Friday for Barcelona. This is our first trip to Spain and a much needed couple time for my husband and myself. I have asthma but am not worried about it. I am the type of person who doesn't worry about these type of things and instead rely on my common sense (washing hands,etc)"
We are headed there on Tuesday. We booked this trip a year ago and have worked all the logistics for our kids to stay with the grandparents and everything is well coordinated. We are just hoping for the best.
"You might wish to read this - https://inews.co.uk/news/health/spain-safe-t… … There does not seem to be any need, at present, to be particularly worried if you are travelling to the Catalan region.EnjoyAnthony"
