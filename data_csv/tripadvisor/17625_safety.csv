Hi - My husband has booked a few nights away for us and has booked Defino hotel. I have read some topics on here and safety around Mestre has come up especially around train station but some posts go back to 2015.Does anyone know the distance of Defino hotel to the station- has the area become any safer? what are the main safety issues in the area. #I appreciate you will get safety issues in all countries and need to be cautious abroad but I don't want to feel on edge returning after nights out. We stayed in Cipro in Rome in November and all was fine- a few issues with homeless around Metro but never really felt unsafe.
"I stay in Mestre whenever I visit Venice and find it to be very safe. It's about a 15-minute walk from the Hotel Delfino to the Mestre Train Station. Would like to call your attention to a well-known supermarket in Mestre: PAM, at 209 Corso del Popolo, next to the Hotel Delfino. PAM has a wonderful deli and a good selection of wines and spirits at bargain prices."
"The Delfino is pretty close to the station - about 5 - 10 minutes walk at the most. It's a busy area and in daytime you will have no concerns about safety. At night you may feel a bit uneasy in the immediate vicinity of the station, but if there are two of you together and you are walking purposefully back to your hotel you will be fine."
"By the way, the bus stop that takes you to Venice is across the street from the Hotel Delfino and the bus back from Venice stops right in front of your hotel."
Thanks do you know what time they run until and costs this seems a better option x
The buses run until shortly after midnight.The bus from Mestre to Venice (Piazzale Roma) is €1.50.(A train ticket from Mestre to Venice is €1.25.)
"Consider buying a Tourist Travel Card ACTV, which entitles you to unlimited use of the waterbuses (vaporetti) serving Venice and the islands of the lagoon, and to unlimited use of ACTV Mestre land bus and tram service to and from Venice and in Mestre itself-and land buses on Lido. (A trip on a vaporetto without the card would cost you €7.50.) The card does not cover train travel.ACTV Tourist Travel Cards, which can be purchased either on line, at the airport, in Mestre, or in Venice, are a tremendous bargain that will pay for themselves many times over during your visit to Venice. The link below will provide information about cost and card selection, regardless of where you plan to make your purchase. (If you purchase online you must print and later exchange a voucher for the actual Tourist Travel Card at designated ACTV locations.)http://bit.ly/2lM96j5http://bit.ly/2hDKw4qThe Rolling Venice discount card is for young people between 6 and 29 years of age. (Children below the age of six travel free.)www.veneziaunica.it/en/content/rolling-veniceThe validity of an ACTV Travel Card (also known as a ""pass"") starts from the exact moment of the first validation. Each ACTV ""pass"" starts when it is first activated, not when you first collect it, and ends exactly 72 hours later for the three-day pass, for example.If your first trip begins at 6 p.m. on a Tuesday, the three-day pass will be valid until 5:59 p.m. on a Friday.You must complete your final journey before the pass expires.Validate your ticket before you get on the vaporetto. If you do not validate the ticket you can be fined. To validate the ticket, pass the card in front of the sensor in the center of the validation machine before entering the boarding area; a green light and a beep will confirm that the validation has been successful. A red light and buzz indicates that there is a problem and the ticket has not been correctly validated or has expired. And you must also pass the card in front of the sensor in the center of the validation machine before entering the boarding area for every subsequent trip."
"Thank you I did look at the travel cards but became confused on what one I would need, I suppose if I buy when I arrive they could help advice"
"Hey thanks for puttting this question up in Mestre. We are travelling there as well and staying at the Elite hotel.I was wondering how safe it is to walk up the main street, Forte Marghera to the Piazza Ferretto and the main area for shopping and also venturing out at night to the restaurants. I am with my husband and our 80 year old father, (who is a sprightly 80 year old, no difficulty in walking). Any suggestions for this area and good priced restaurants would be appreciated, thanks"
"plmpgm63: It would be too far to walk. Take a taxi or the tram.I would recommend Mestre's Osteria Plip (Via San Dona 195/C), one of the most remarkable restaurants in the Veneto. The seasonal menu is extensive, with numerous vegetarian selections, and very reasonably priced.http://bit.ly/2fPfwMuhttp://bit.ly/2pnGorqMestre-Venice Tram:http://bit.ly/2xXNuGhhttp://bit.ly/2xXWdbphttp://bit.ly/2h16qhAEdited: 2 years ago "
"I would not walk from the train station to Corso del Popolo (where hotel Delfino is located) after dark unless necessary. During the day it is more or less okay, if you are attentive. At night, I would discourage it unless you are fluent in Italian or in a group of at least half a dozen.the 4-4L lines stop directly in Corso del Popolo from Piazzale Roma, so that is a reasonable option.Walking the length of Viale San Marco from Forte Marghera to the center after dark would also be something I would discourage. There is the T1 tram line which would take you to/from the Mestre Centro stop until around midnight.The PalaPLIP is, I would agree, one of the worthwhile attractions I can second on the mainland, with a good (and variable) menu for both food and drink. It is not cheap, but not overpriced either."
"Could I ask what sort of risk is in this area please as slightly concerned now, as wanted to eat out etc in Mestre in evenings but won't put ourselves at risk. Thanks"
"there is the more or less constant presence of beggars, drunkards, people under the influence of other substances, vagabonds of unknown origin that use less illuminated corners and side streets as open-air toilet facilities, as well as an increase over the past 5+ years in petty crimes such as robbery which have been documented in the local papers and news reports. If you take a taxi, or the public transport, from right outside your hotel, you should be okay. It is a completely different situation from wandering around Venice late at night, which is much safer in most all areas of the city, particularly when compared to the areas in Mestre around the train station and near there between Via Piave and Via Cappuccina and Corso del Popolo.The areas around Piazza Ferretto are relatively ""tranquilli"" once you get there."
"You also need to be especially mindful when you're moving around in crowded areas in Venice, which tend to attract unusually skillful pickpockets, especially on and near Piazza San Marco, the Rialto Bridge, and on the vaporetti.Last year two thunderous smoke bombs were set off in Piazza San Marco, one near St. Mark's Basilica bell tower, and another in the middle of the middle of the piazza, by thieves as a diversionary tactic while attempting to rob a nearby jewelry shop. The would-be jewel thieves tossed the smoke bombs into the crowd and tried to grab diamonds from the jewelry shop. The bombs, generating huge amounts of thick, black smoke, created widespread panic in the square, causing hundreds of tourists to flee for safer ground, thinking it was a terrorist attack. The bell tower, which was packed with tourists at the time, rapidly filled with choking smoke as it made its way up into the shaft of the building, forcing terrified visitors to rush out, many fearing they were being targeted by radical extremists.And Piazzale Roma can be very problematic in the evening. The beggars of Venice, who seem to favor staking out the entrances to the city's beautiful churches in the morning and midafternoon, at the end of the day and throughout the evening largely gravitate to Piazzale Roma, where they co-mingle with the homeless (some of whom seem very ill) and drug addicts, to continue their aggressive panhandling."
"OP, welcome to the somewhat repetitive world of the Venice forum, where whenever anyone points out that parts of Mestre can feel a bit dodgy late at night, another frequent poster tries to suggest that Venice itself is also dodgy. Look at where respondents no 12 and 13 live, and you can easily work out which of them knows what he is talking about.The reality is that the historic centre of Venice is one of the safest cities in Europe."
"Tourists traveling into Venice via the Santa Lucia Train Station need to be particularly careful with their purses and wallets. A Japanese visitor, for example, had €35,000 lifted from her purse shortly after she left the Santa Lucia station (the story made international news). Pickpockets in Venice, it should be noted, are often well-dressed and seldom fit the stereotype.Venice is a lovely city, but it needs to do a far better job of protecting its tourists from thieves."
"Last year two thunderous smoke bombs were set off in Piazza San Marco, one near St. Mark's Basilica bell tower, and another in the middle of the middle of the piazza, by thieves as a diversionary tactic while attempting to rob a nearby jewelry shop.And in 2001 two planes hit the world trade center. So what? Should I reach NYC only by train?Did international news explain how a japanes tourist legally entered Italy with 40.000 $ in cash?"
"I find the vigorous defense of Mestre by naming a few incidents in Venice proper...very curiousOP: Ultimately, I think the bottom line is (for me) choosing to stay in Venice to really enjoy the city fully, to have easy access back to your accommodations if you want a break or wish to rest a bit before dinner, etc - Do you really see yourself out of your hotel and away from it for 12 hours or more without a chance at a break?There is nothing like staying in Venice - it is unique in every possible way so if you can find somewhere that does suit your budget IN Venice, maybe consider it instead of staying in Mestre which is no more than a generic (boring) outpost that is a hassle to stay in while visiting Venice."
"For budget-minded travelers who would like to cut their hotel expenses by over 50%, that is reason enough to book a room in Mestre while visiting Venice. Over a million tourists do it every year (safely, I might add), and if the TripAdvisor reviews are any indication, most seem genuinely pleased with their choice."
"I do think I would go with more what I heart Venice says about safety in Mestre,"
"Yes, the historic centre of Venice is one of the safest cities. It's safe to walk the streets of Venice both day AND night. Venice is a beautiful city, a UNESCO city.None of that can be said about Mestre. Mestre is not beautiful, and you would feel edgy walking at night in Mestre.It's a disservice to say Mestre is ""very"" safe.Hopefully you would stay in Venice to enjoy the city fully as MomCat1992 indicated, and then you could especially enjoy Venice in the early morning, and later in the evening. And it is possible to stay in Venice on a budget.And yes also for easy access to your lodging during the day if need be.For sure there is nothing like staying in Venice. There is only one Venice, unique, and so specialAnd it's safe!VagabondaEdited: 2 years ago "
"I would venture a guess that people who say they were pleased with staying in Mestre are folks that have not had the experience and unique pleasure of staying in Venice and enjoying it into the night and very early morning hours. It is an entirely different experience. And, of course, people who have not had the chance at a stay in Venice will not know what they are missingIf people truly can't find lodging in their budget range, then sure, it's fine to have an alternative to Venice but often with some due diligence, one can find places right in Venice that do suit budget needs - This OP's question rather implies that they could consider staying in Venice rather than Mestre based on the ""safety"" issue - and, if so, then offering additional reasons why a stay in Venice is desired may help them sort out their hesitation re: their current booking."
"Yes, Venice is one of the safest cities, but it is not entirely safe, and the OP needs to know this, too. To add what I indicated earlier:In January of this year jewel thieves once again targeted Piazza San Marco. Jewels worth several million euros from the Treasures of the Mughals and Maharajahs show at Venice's Doge's Palace were stolen from a case. As soon as the alarm rang the palazzo was shut down in a vain bid to trap the thieves.And last year Italian police broke up a jihadist cell in Venice that planned to blow up the city's famous Rialto Bridge in the hope of killing hundreds of tourists.Mestre, which is the mainland part of Venice, may lack the glamour of the historic center, but it is a good, safe choice for budget travelers like me. You very often get a much better hotel room for your money in Mestre. Plus, you won't have to carry heavy luggage aboard crowded vaporetti, across stepped bridges, and up narrow staircases to get to your hotel room--a big advantage for some seniors and those with disabilities, particularly during periods of heavy flooding."
"Every tourist should expect pick-pocketing in cities throughout Italy.But there's a difference between petty theft, and physical harm.Those jewel thieves weren't targeting tourists. And unfortunately terrorism threats are worldwide.Does anyone say, ""I'm saving for a holiday to go to Mestre?""Venice is the destination, not Mestre.Mestre is not safe, nor is it recommended to walk the streets at night.A better-value hotel room isn't worth the edgy feeling of walking a dodgy neighbourhood at night.And as Sophie just indicated here, ""Mestre is not Venice, is the best way to say it, Venice with some research does not have to be that expensive, much the better choice""https:/…89540699It is absolutely possible to stay in Venice on a budget.Vagabonda"
"The Piazza San Marco jewel thieves most likely did not carry water pistols with them, just in case something went terribly wrong. Sad to say, tourists were directly in harm's way in both instances during these heists.Visitors to Venice need a broader picture of the safety issues regarding the historic center, not back-scratching testimonials that minimize such problems, especially those plaguing the dodgy areas around the Santa Lucia Train Station and Piazzale Roma.Although some may think it's déclassé to stay in Mestre while visiting Venice, I, and the million-or-so budget travelers who stay in Mestre every year without incident, obviously don't."
"I'm with you, Monte. Well said. I've stayed in both Venice and Mestre and prefer to stay in Mestre."
"Hi domenicv7 and welcome to the forum. It’s intriguing and unusual that you have joined just to take part in this conversation, rather than to ask a question. What was it about Mestre that made you prefer it to Venice itself?"
"Visitors to Venice need more than your suppositions about pistols.https:/…5084e3072542The hallmark of Wednesday's Palazzo Ducale job is, rather, one of confident, quiet, almost elegant execution, followed by an equally confident escape on foot by simply blending into the crowd. And on a parallel thread...https:/…89544651Vagabonda"
"You can stay in Lido on the budget. It won’t be luxurious, but could be pretty affordable. From Lido, you can take a vaporetto to get to Venice. Very pleasant boat ride. I would definitely stay in Venice (or Lido), but would not stay in Mestre even if someone pays me to do it. Not only because of safety, which is obviously a concern, but because it looks awful."
"Dhmellor, read my post carefully. I didn't say that I preferred Mestre to Venice. I stated that I preferred staying in Mestre to staying in Venice. Big difference.My main reason being, similar to that of Monte, better value for your money."
"If all the factors that a person uses to determine ""value"" in a lodging choice can be placed on a spreadsheet, such as all the things the ""Mayor of Mestre"" always repeats --big modern rooms, bountiful buffet breakfasts, lower rates--then perhaps Mestre is best for you. Setting aside the argument that lodging in Venice has to be expensive--it doesn't--I would like to point out one disservice this ""Mestre is just fine for your stay"" argument does to, especially, first-time visitors.My first trip to Venice, I didn't sleep there at all. I landed at Marco Polo, took a shuttle to a cruise ship, and sailed down the Giudecca Canal and out to sea. I had no desire to see Venice--I had heard all the stories about smelly canals and rampant pigeons and tourists packing the city that it held absolutely no appeal to me. I ended up going back to Venice with a family member who wanted to go, but didn't want to go alone. This time, we stayed in Venice, in Dorsoduro. It was during this trip that I discovered what many here describe as the Magic of Venice--walking out early before sunrise and watching the earliest light of dawn in Piazza San Marco (good luck doing this if you're staying in Mestre), wandering ancient, back lanes without another tourist in sight, enjoying the late evenings and nights, the lights playing across the water, the indescribable feeling of being someplace unique in history, geography, and architecture, both modest and grand. And, yes, although you can see most of these things if you stay in Mestre, part of the magic of the place for me is the immersion into a different world for however long I am lucky enough to be there. When I stay there, I never see a car, a bike, a skateboard--no modern form of ground transportation. The calli are a winding reminder of what cities where like before urban rectangular blocks took over the world. The almost constant sound of lapping water reminding you the lagoon is as much a part of this city as the land. For me, this sense of tasting a now long-gone era, this Venetian Spell, if you will, would be broken by having to traverse modernity in Mestre. For me, abiding in the place, feeling it, sensing the heft of its history as soon as I walk out the door of where I'm staying has more value than any bountiful buffet breakfast. And I never would have discovered this if I had decided to stay in Mestre , which is where I see this as a disservice to first-time visitors. Like me, they won't know if they will feel this until they try it. Now, if all this sounds like so much mumbo-jumbo, or if you do, indeed, value only tangibles when deciding where to stay, then perhaps you don't need time on the islands to figure out whether you'll fall for La Serenissima the way I and many others have. And that's fine--we are different people, and that's as it should be. But I would hate to think of someone missing out on something that has the potential to move them, to fill them with a deep sense of awe, that I believe only actually staying in Venice and enjoying it's many faces during the varying hours of day and night can provide."
"I agree with all that you say, Eric. On our first two trips to Venice we stayed on the island and enjoyed everything except our accommodation - maybe we made poor choices but we're not the only ones to discover that accommodation in Mestre is better value for money. For first timers, I agree that it is preferable to stay on the island - and, hopefully, have good luck with accommodation.On our past two trips we've stayed in Mestre and had no experience with safety issues - doesn't mean they don't exist, as is the case in Venice. Being early risers we've been in Venice to experience, as you describe, 'the earliest light of dawn' - the bus/train from Mestre takes 10-15 minutes. We've also enjoyed Venice after dark - I guess being in our late 40s we aren't looking to return to our room for a mid afternoon nap.The negativity directed at both places is disappointing but, obviously, having been to Venice on four occasions (staying 4-5 nights each time), we enjoy the place - and we have also enjoyed staying in Mestre."
"Eric, thank you for expressing so vividly how some of us feel about Venice.‘the indescribable feeling of being someplace unique in history, geography, and architecture, both modest and grand.’Exactly! But if the Mayor of Mestre prefers a nice buffet breakfast, fine - that’s his choice."
"Dhmellor, sorry seems to be the hardest word"
The cash limit was raised a few years back. I think it's currently 3k. I think.But a point raised earlier. How did she first get out of Japan? I'm sure they have a requirement to declare large sums of cash. Then how did she get into Italy which I think still has the 10K limit.
thank you Eric- very helpful & moving!
"Beautiful post, Eric... Thank you! Very inspiring and convincing as well."
"Thank you Eric S for your perspective and descritpion that so touches the heart, and thank you I_heart_Venice for practical and factual perspectives on the ground there that are so sensible.Vagabonda"
"Those of us who have been (many times) can decide from prior experiences what might best meet our needs for subsequent visits, but it is different for first-time visitors, and hopefully there's a careful and detailed, and diligent read of these posts for anyone anticipating their FIRST visit to this magical city that is Venice.Don't shortchange yourself ever with Mestre.Vagabonda"
"Although I'm not really the Mayor of Mestre, I would certainly be proud to be the top elected official of this wonderful mainland community that is home to many of the hard-working, working-class people who daily do their very best to make certain the millions of tourists visiting Venice every year have pleasurable and memorable experiences."
"These are travel forums, and the information posted here on these forums needs to service those tourists seeking factual and reliable information so they can best make decisions for their hard earned monies throughout the year to enjoy their annual holidays.It's not about benefiting people of any community.That idea is mis-founded, and perhaps indicates a connections to this local community that might bias your judgement.Might Mestre be an ancestral town with family or family businesses in the town?VagabondaEdited: 2 years ago "
"First-time visitors, surely stay in Venice.Post-Venice visitors, read this....https:/…89557152You're on holiday!!You have saved all year for the glories of your holiday, and anticipate Venice.Why would you shortchange yourself??And yes, Venice is one of a kind in the world. You might like Venice, or not (and I have a cousin who detests Venice) , but there is no denying how unique it is. And surely it didn't gain UNESCO status if it didn't warrant the status.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/veniceVenice is historical; it's amazing; and Mestre can't tie its shoelace even in history alone.You can do better than Mestre....Do your homework.If budget is limiting, there are many options in Venice. Just enquire for suggestions.If mobility is an issue, there are options.Research, and enjoy.These constant few posters for Mestre are doing a disservice, and especially to first-time visitors.Aren't you here for Venice???And if ""local"" communities are your focus, there are many far superior experiences than Mestre for local experiences.,I have family in the area, and I know it well.I have posted on these forums for over ten years, and find these biased recommendations outrageous.Mestre might be optimal for you after research and searching your heart, but do your research first.Vagabonda"
"Some objectivity in responding to specific questions without bias would go a long way on this forum.Listening to each poster's needs, and what's best for that membe would go a long way here.This isn't about you, and what you like.Listen!!!And then respond with an open mind.Vagabonda"
"For me it’s purely a matter of esthetics. Mestre is such a failure when it comes to pleasing architecture that one would have to pay me to stay there. When on vacation, i must be sorrounded by beautiful things, not going to waste my life looking at “low income housing”."

Is it a safe walk at 6pm from the mestre train station to the hotel?
"If you mean the Hotel Delfino, in daylight it is safe enough if you use normal care and attention to your surroundings, but it is over a kilometer, so probably not the easiest 15-20 minute walk with luggage in tow (so much for the ""convenience"" of not dragging luggage over bridges in Venice). I would prefer not to do it after dark. It depends on when you will be staying there as to if it will be dark at 6pm or not."
"Sorry I have not responded sooner, I did not get further email notifications, logged on and see my post was top of the forum.Firstly thank you all so much for your input and it has made very interesting reading. Unfortunetly staying in Venice is not a option on this occasion- this was booked for me by my husband and as a package break. Delfino was the hotel on the package available and according to husband flights and searching accommodation was coming in as a lot more expensive, as this is a break away- adult time for a few days and having other holidays booked he went for the option best at the time of booking.I am sorry my post caused such devide- I somehow have this knack on TA last year I managed it on a Tenerife forum over places to eat!! We visited Rome last year and I booked to stay in Cipro as first time visitors I was unsure of best locations despite researching- I do research better than the husband lol- but as has been pointed out now after being a first time visitor I will know where I want to stay on our second visit.I think that we will stay away from the train station area altogether and as buses dedpart from outside the hotel we can do this thankfully. I am concerned by some posts about the safety in Mestre as it looks like there is a nice restaurant literally 5 mins away with great review on TA but as means side streets think we will avoid.I doubt this will be our first visit so will definitely look at Venice as options to stay next time too- having to travel back to hotel to get changed for evening then back to Venice is slightly off putting but heyho i'm sure it will be worth it. Thank you all so much for great advice :) x"
"""I am sorry my post caused such devide"".IT's OK, gsimh, you didn't cause it - it's a somewhat one-sided recurring debate between a small group of regulars, and it's been going on for a long time! Most of the posters recommend visitors to stay in the historic centre of Venice, but one member, the self- appointed cheer-leader for the unprepossessing town of Mestre, sticks up for it valiantly.That's all. It's all rather predictable and repetitive!"

"Just today, on the print version of the Il Gazzettino newspaper (but not the public on-line version) there was a full page special regarding several grievous recent events in the area discussed in this thread, around the train station and between Via Piave and Corso del Popolo (an area that includes Via Cappuccina and the T2 tram line). Several other local sources have separate coverage of some of the same events on-line (all in Italian language, of course):…veneziatoday.it/rapina-stazione-arresto-nig… and …gelocal.it/venezia/cronaca/2018/03/10/news/… two men attacked (hitting and kicking) and robbed a man walking in the area of the train station. One of the attackers/robbers was in possession of drugs when he was caught by the police shortly after in the same area;…veneziatoday.it/rapina-pam-corso-popolo-arr… a shoplifter ended up attacking the security guard at the Corso del Popolo PAM supermarket to try and get away;and on a slightly more positive note: veneziatoday.it/cronaca/corteo-festa-donna-a… women staged a protest march on March 8 for International Women's Day against the closure (several months ago, due to a couple of serious attacks) of the underpassage connecting Mestre with Marghera below the train tracks, requesting that security be ""beefed up"" to render the area safe again (which it currently is not, in the residents' opinions, thus the reason for protesting);"
One shoplifter of tuna and an attempted unarmed mugging make a city unsafe? How old are you?
"Actually, the full page article (only print, unfortunately) on page XXII of the Venezia/Mestre (local section) reports three similar incidents in that area in the last ten days, but the Italian newspapers often publish only a small portion of their contents on-line, so I can't link to it. Unfortunately the problems are concentrated around the area of the Mestre train station (the south ends of Via Piave, Via Cappuccina and Corso del Popolo), which has undergone a process of serious urban deterioration over the past years. And these single events are not what makes the city unsafe, it is that they continue to happen week in and week out, with multiple incidents, with supposedly increased police presence which doesn't make nary a dent in the micro-criminality."
"""How old are you?"", really? please remove your comment, I find it offensive, abusive, and completely inappropriate. I posted links to public sources of some of the events, directly related to the specific topic of this thread, and you ask if I am immature or a child for doing so? Unbelievable... Completely unacceptable."
"Because the micro-criminality problem can't be solved thanks to police forces. You must have missed the epidemic of eroin during the late 70s, otherwise you knew it. The area around train station was a carpet of syringes."
Great information!Thank you for posting!
"Just wanted to say thank you to all who voiced opinions on my post. We have just returned from Venice and WOW is all I can really say, it was above my expectations and on a will be back shortly list of ours! We survived Mestre no issues although not as beautiful as Venice agreed we were ok. I did feel on edge but think it was more being cautious due to responces I received but it is better to know then not. We travelled to Venice each day and back again in the evening as the route was so easy, had I been more relaxed about Mestre we would have eaten there a few evenings. We stayed at Delpino hotel and bus stops are directly outside, the airport bus stopped for us outside too. We did not have to go to train station for the return airport bus, simply turn right out of hotel walk 5 mins and collect the avto from there. I must admit it was the train station which was my concern but not once did we walk near. My husband the night before our last walked out late ( after midnight ) to the bank 5 mins away and said there was no issue and he felt safe, our last day I was brave walked slightly round Mestre found a little restaurant I would have loved to have tried so will in future. Although not the prettiest of areas we would if cost came into it stay in Mestre again. X"
"gsimh: Thanks for posting your informative trip report. Glad to hear you had a good, safe time in both Mestre and Venice."
"I have just come back from Venice stayed 1 night in Mestre, what a horrible place, nice in day in the evening full of young immigrant looking people we got followed by 2 down a dark street to hotel, the hotel even said in the daytime it’s safe in the night time it’s NOT!Never again will I go there"
Definitely things have gone downhill in the last couple of years.
This makes for very scary readingWe had planned to stay here..not so sure now.We like to walk out in evening to different restaurants

"Mestre, especially the areas near the train station (where the majority of hotels is concentrated) is slowly improving, after a couple of extensive, police coordinated mutli-force dragnets, but is still not anywhere to wander after dark, particularly if you are not fluent in Italian and well acquainted with the area. The budget seems reasonable, but can depend greatly on the period you are travelling. Midweek in low season it is quite a high budget, weekends in high season a bit on the low side. In low season the price-differential between Venice and Mestre is greatly reduced, making the choice to stay in Mestre almost counter-intuitive once you factor the travel time into the calculations."
"Stayed in Mestre end of Sept 2018- and loved it- No it is not Venice but it is where the wonderful kind helpful Italians live- local food cafes/resturants, get into the big main plaza etc wander the back streets of old Mestre- plenty of places to eat-We did not feel threatened at any time and glad we stayed outside of beautiful Venice, which when busy is tourists hell-the streets lined with tables and very busy.Buses trains and trams run into Venice from Mestre frequently."
"Hi heblady - welcome to Venice! This is a strange old thread - best not to take it too seriously! There are a few regulars re-running old disputes, and one or two members who seem to have changed their user names.......Mestre is not really dangerous but the real point is that it not Venice. It’s not far away but it’s another world! Stay in Venice - you will not regret it, and your budget is sufficient."
"I am driving myself insane with research!!!..we are going in February( husband is keen photographer) believe the light is good then.I just thought Tritone hotel would be fine..near the bus stationJust need clean white sheets, a clean en-suite really.We like a hotelThankyou Tipper for your replyEdited: 1 year ago "
We stayed in an Airbnb just off main street Mestre- wonderful- I don't think I can name it on here?Airport bus stops in main Mestre street two mins walk (max!) from BnB- Watch out for Modi café )main street Mestre) ripped us off.
"staying in VeniceIf your accommodation is anywhere inside Venice you will have a challenge getting to it- make sure you know just where and how to etc-the chap coming in a few mins to collect his hire machine loves Venice- goes there repeatedly, year after year, but spent three hours trying to find his accommodation the first time!!have you been watching the 'Venice' series on TV- the emergency service as difficulties finding places - and they have lived there for years-"
No..not seen thatThis is the reason I was looking to stay at Mestre..We do not fancy trolling round with baggage trying to find a place.
"I would say, based on our experience...ignore all the negatives re Mestre- It is not a beautiful town but it is a very pleasant place with lots of old buildings/streets - we did hear a few tourists but not many (Sept.) The town square is nice and many streets leading off it.Quiet in Febuary? - but Rests/ cafes (most?) are there to cater to the locals.20 mins approx. from airport & 20 mins into Venice by bus- tram 5 mins walk from main street - you would need to take the bust to the Mestre train station - from where we took a train to Verona- 1 hour!My wife told me to say...if/when we go back we would stay in Mestre! good luck .Edited: 1 year ago "
"Millions of tourists a year manage to find their accommodations in Venice, can't fathom that being a reason for staying in depressing Mestre."
"Thankyou all..MomCat..it will suit us fine.we can have the days in Venice.The hotel deluxe room has all we wantWe get up very early and like to have the day outWe are early bedders anyway.THIS is our first taster of Venice..we can explore and decide, if we like it, where to stay next time around.I just felt this was an easy option..for our needs"
"But not really a first taster of Venice at those special times in the early morning and late evenings - So close and yet so far, worlds apart...VagabondaEdited: 1 year ago "
"Hi this original post was mine- We stayed in Mestre and found all was ok- we did not venture near startion and got off bus outside hotel, we found it fine :) If we visited again and it meant saving hundreds would deffo stay in Mestre again :)"
"Vagabonda..we will have dinner there and come back late..may get the chance to see the Opera tooIt is what it is..It suits US..at this time....We are all different , ..due to a long illness and still in recovery..want to make things as easy as possible.ie: lugging bags around, ..Hopefully NEXT time we will change thingsWe got a good price.I know ( which is important) the room will be clean..take dettox wipes anyway..be away from canal and areas with mozzie bites..this is a a serious consideration....People have reasons for what they do"
"That's certainly understandable then heblady, and yes, it would then suit you.Best wishes for a wonderful holiday, and a speedy and full recovery.Vagabonda"
"While it does seem to suit you, do keep in mind that if you get tired during the day, the time/hassle involved in being able to return to your room for a rest will be challenging - You will basically be there for about 10 hours or more if you intend to have dinner in Venice and that is a long time to be out and about, walking as much as one does there (or in any destination which is mostly pedestrian) - regardless of health status. I can never be out constantly full day and into the night without wanting a break. But, as you say, we are all different and, hopefully, this is not an issue for you.In any case, do have a wonderful trip -"
Why have dinner in Venice- fine/OK if it suits but it is hardly a must do- beautiful city beyond compare but be aware of the tourist traps - think about it -most places know you won't be back!!When we dined in Mestre we had what the locals had- enjoyed the meals and their company.AND....how many locals go back into Venice to dine?
"Venice (like Taormina) has many repeat visitors, and visitors who often frequent the same restaurants.But it's not only about dinner in Venice, but the beauty of Venice in the evening, and especially after day trippers depart.If it's just a local town, and local experiences you're after, well there are many better choices throughout Italy than Mestre.Yes, Venice is a beautiful city beyond compare, and so if the reason for travel is to see Venice....MomCat's point is very valid. If planning to stay in Venice for several days, you would be going back and forth between Mestre and Venice many times on multiple days, and perhaps more than once daily.Vagabonda"
"Not sure why what locals do would matter given that this is a travel forum for visitors, not locals.If you enjoyed Mestre, great; but, not everywhere in Venice is a so-called ""tourist trap"" and I'm also not sure what it means to say they know you won't be back? Who cares? Most restaurants know that about tourists anywhere in the world.Do some mooching away from the main hotspots like Rialto, San Marco and a few others and you can find some very good places to enjoy a nice meal.Everyone has their own personal priorities - if eating in Venice is something one looks forward to then they can, with some careful looking, find somewhere very satisfying and enjoyable.Not everyone is out to get you (the tourists) - people do have pride in their work even while there are some less than welcoming places that do fit the description of ""tourist trap"" -"
"Mestre is Not depressing- It is not Venice and is not competing either but to call it depressing????? The fact that millions of tourists stay in Venice might make Mestre a refreshing escape!!Also - Mestre is being discussed due to it's close proximity to Venice- to suggest that other towns in Italy, regardless of distance could be considered is hardly helpful."
"Mom Cat..We do pace it..IF we go for dinner, then we would leave the hotel in afternoon..we do plan to save some time to have early dinner and opera. I know now my limitationsThankyou Vagabonda for the well wishesI am only trying to get across here..people have different, valid, reasons for doing things.We paced it in Garda and Sorrento... We would not be out for a 10 hour day (I wish)Edited: 1 year ago "
"Momcatt1992Appreciate this is a travel forum but that does not preclude one from inviting considerations in respect of the local population- who, from my albeit limited experience, but also in discussion with them, rarely return to Venice for a meal- now you have some idea which I trust enables you to be better informed."
"I do find it depressing - personal opinions are allowed here.And, I am informed as much as I feel a need about the issue of whether locals go into Venice at night for dinner, I am sure plenty do so and others don't - just like anywhere.Glad you seem so excited about Mestre - at least you know you like it and don't need to bother ever staying in Venice.heblady: I think most people do comprehend that everyone is different; suggestions here to you were about specific issues you may not have considered given (I believe) you have not yet been to Venice before and are unfamiliar with the timings of transportation, etc.If you have been and you know for certain all this works for you - great; I am sure you will have the sort of visit you have worked out for yourselves. I hope you do."
"unless you are visiting during Carnival, the price difference between Mestre and Venice is actually much less than many expect, particularly with the recent uptick in competition from B&Bs (which doubled to nearly 8000 units the last 36 months). In February, the daylight hours will be limited, and the area around the Tritone hotel is not someplace to wander after dark (much of that area is not all that great even during the day). Also, in the evening the n°2 buses which serve that area from Piazzale Roma are regularly overcrowded, making for a horrible end to what might be an otherwise long and tiring day."
"Thank mom cat.No , not been yet..This is a toe in the water. Trying to make it work for US.We know the days are short then (same as home) and we will make the most of it.We can get a taxi to a restaurant if we need to..plus the hotel offers a restaurantWe tend to enjoy a big lunch on holiday ( with wine) and something light at nightI will leave this nowThankyou to all who have replied and been helpful to me"
"Hi heblady,I sincerely do wish you well, and I understand your reasons for doing as you have decided.Information is provided on these forums so that each can decide what best suits them.It is your holiday.But it is all a bit academic until there's practical and real experience.It doesn't seem a holiday should be so hard to make it work, nor does a Best Western hotel restaurant seem so palatable.Surely not with Venice at your feet.And not with your budget.And not with hopes of an opera at night.As Tipper r indicated, "" It is not a beautiful town"".And Mestre surely isn't beautiful.You'll get to Venice from Scotland so is it really that much more effort to get from the airport to Venice than it is to get from the airport to Mestre, and then have to deal with the daily transport from Mestre to Venice?And for a photographer who would appreciate good light?I'm speaking as an Italian with prior experience, and multiple and numerous visits to Venice.I hope you also understand my reasons for recommending as I do.I am not trying to sway your decision.I'm trying to provide facts for the best experience, and not necessarily for you as you've decided, but for others who might stumble on this thread.But to address some issues on this topic for those anticipating and planning future travel - If Venice is your destination, why wouldn't you stay in Venice?And especially during the low season when costs are comparable.When you saved and planned for flights and lodging, and perhaps holiday time off from work, were you thinking about seeing Venice, or Mestre?Do you hear anyone saying, ""I saved and planning holiday time from work for a trip to Italy to see Mestre?""Mestre is depressing, even with recent improvements. You still wouldn't want to walk areas at night. And these include areas near the very public transport if you were to arrive from Venice late at night.Keep in mind that dinner typically begins at 20:00.Once you've decided to lodge outside Venice, no matter how near or how far, you're a day tripper.Mestre's proximity to Venice isn't going to matter very much.You're not in Venice, and you're a day tripper.So for a few more minutes on public transport, you might base in a town that would at least be enjoyable for those hours you're not in Venice.If you'd like a refreshing escape from tourists in Venice, consider local areas of Venice that aren't touristy. Take a look at Cannaregio located near the train station.To think such a beautiful and fabulous UNESCO city like Venice is so near, and then to stay in Mestre, well that just falls short, and it's sad.Vagabonda"
"Oh Mestre, l’ascella d’Italia. That’s the nickname we in Veneto have for Mestre. Enough said.Depressing, yes."
Some people don't know when to stop...…………..No clues- how you doing Vagabonda….!.
"That is the key as Vagabonda has said: this thread is not just for the OP and others here that posted about staying in Mestre; it is for the countless others who read these forums but never post and there are many such readers of TA.At this point, the info/explanations are for those readers (new travelers to Venice) who might be considering Mestre, thinking it is a good option vs. staying in Venice itself."
"""we are going in February( husband is keen photographer) believe the light is good then.""One advantage of the short daylight hours is you won't need to wake up that early. But seems like sunrise in February isn't much after 7am. If the idea is to take a sunrise picture of Venice it's easier being in Venice.Still 7am in Feb is a lot better than 5am in June -)"

"All the slack you would require heblady! :-)Consider posting on the Venice forums with your own new thread for best results on suggestions of where to stay, and transfers.Also note that star ratings mean very little in Italy.A star rating in Italy is an indication of amenities and not quality, so it becomes important to read reviews with a critical eye to determine which accommodation offers amenities that are important to you.Hotels earns those star ratings for position, services like room service or a night porter, lift, swimming pool, frequency of towel change....Locanada San Barnaba is convenient and a gem, no lift, but a double room on the lobby floor, and it's an easy and very short (flat) walk from the Ca'Rezzonico vaporetto landing stage. Locanada San Barnaba perhaps isn't the luxury you're seeking, but a sweet local experience, a very good breakfast, and it's conveniently located and relatively easy to reach with luggage.https:/…27289007https:/…55035399Vagabonda"

"Tipper r - yes, you have said ""repeatedly"" that you believe Mestre is a ""reasonable alternative"" to staying in Venice. That is your opinion.The opinion of some others, including myself, is that it is not a ""reasonable alternative"" to staying Venice. A depressing alternative, yes but - to me - not a ""reasonable"" one. Is there some reason only certain opinions are okay by you? All opinions are allowed here on the forum. Yours, mine, Vagabonda, the OP and everyone else. And, we are talking about opinions, not facts."
"Those were mostly pictures of right around the train station, and yes, very depressing neighborhood.You can go yourselves to Googlemaps and randomly put your finger on different parts of the town.Pretty much the entire town is made up of working class apartment buildings, and hotels.And just to keep it fair, there is ONE pretty area in town,The main square, Piazza Ferretto, is a mile (1.5 km) away from station, and the walk is not pretty, would hate to do it at night. I do not doubt that there are bars and restaurants close to that location.I would feel terrible to recommend to others to stay in Mestre, and risk them being overly disappointed. I Much prefer to tell it like it is, and then if they still decide to stay there, it’s completely on them.You can dress it as you wish, Tipper, but we all know ugly, depressing, unsafe, undesirable when we see it. You can make that decision for yourself, that it is worth it to you to compromise location to stay on budget, or for other reasons, and you might decide to stay in Mestre (or other locations outside of the “destination” city), but responsible advisers should not convince you to do so and tell you that Mestre is totally fine and a good alternate, as it is not - but yes, cheaper maybe.Another comment I have is that some travelers from other industrial, working class, post war architecture type urban locations, might have a higher threshold for starkness, and might be able to stomach Mestre a lot more than most of us.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Those specific Street Views were chosen to show the bus terminal, the train station, and the area around Hotel Tritone as these were previously discussed here.Mestre is working, modern, urban, and industrial.italyheaven.co.uk/veneto/venice/mestre.htmlVagabonda"
"I had the same thought as you about travellers from other industrial port towns latrevisana.But I've been through Portsmouth on a return from Isle of Wight, and would opt for Portsmouth over Mestre every time.Vagabonda"
"I have spent my life living in the countryside. I have visited most continents and dozens of countries and I have stayed/lived in abject poverty and in absolute splendour When I refer to Mestre I do not refer to the Industrial parks etc (Why do so?)But the area within an approx. 15/20 mins walking radius around Piazza Ferretto.For some reason Mestre is being purposely misrepresented. Thousands of Italians, of various incomes, live in Mestre with a variety of housing old and new and yes apartment blocks (Oh how nasty) and New (small) shopping malls and a good variety of rests/cafes, many lovely little bakeries etc etc. There is a tree lined street with numerous eating places/table outside etc and smaller examples of this elsewhere not forgetting Piazza Forretto with iots numerous table tables outside in the square.None of this has been mentioned by those who, one would be forgiven for thinking, have some inbuilt resistence to anyone doing anything with an independent mind.It is fine to stay there for those considering staying outside Venice even though the thought of doing so is an anathema to some who are (mysteriously) so vehemently opposed to those, no doubt more experienced in travel, from doing so.I have never compared Venice to Mestre - although it has been by those who seek to degenerate Mestre."
"I wasn’t necessarily talking about Portsmouth, I was more generalizing about what people might be used to.Tipper we got it, your opinion counts as much as mine. We differ. I have been to Mestre countless times, unfortunately, and I won't change my mind. It hurts my eyes to drive through Mestre.Treviso would be a much prettier, safer, very Italian alternative to staying in Mestre IMO.I am Italian and proud of it, and I want visitors to see the nice parts of Italy not Mestre."
"And rather tired of the accusatory undertones in your posts. I have every right to say that Mestre was a planning and architectural mistake, as it was. It was borne of necessity and rapid industrial growth, with little thought given to livability and aesthetics."
"Yes, tired of the accusatory undertones towards other members with opposing views.It is possible to present information and opinions without personal attacks.Like latrevisana, I am Italian and proud of it, and I also want visitors to see and enjoy the best of Italy, and that's not Mestre. I also won't be changing my mind. Describing Mestre as it is, isn't denigrating Mestre. Mestre is as it is.Mestre is a part of the administrative territory of Venice and represents the expansion of the waterbound city onto the mainland. Together with the more recent Porto Marghera, an industrial centre which arose in the first decade of the last century, it is the realisation of the urban development which the precious lagoon city has never permitted itself.https:/…Why not compare Mestre to Venice if these are the towns being considered for lodging?How else to decide where to stay without information about both?Mestre is modern construction, a working city, industrial, and unattractive.It's impossible not to discuss these parts because the town is largely an industrial centre with urban development, and also because of the ugly area around the train and bus stations where tourists arrive in Mestre, and often stay in the nearby hotels.The hotels are located in this area for proximity to transport to Venice, because Venice is the intended destination, and not Mestre.Mestre is the cheap alternative to Venice.If neglecting all of this, and only discussing Piazza Ferretto then yes, Mestre is being purposely misrepresented here.latrevisana did mention Piazza Ferretto, as well as the Italy Heaven site linked previously. But if you're going to mention Piazza Ferretto, you also have to mention that the walk from the train station at night isn't acceptable.Purposefully misrepresented?By whom?By Mestre's local DE who has family in Mestre?By Italians familiar with the town?By Italy Heaven?By Frommers?https:/…getting-thereDon’t be confused: Mestre is a charmless industrial city that’s the last major stop on the mainland (some trains also stop at the next station, Venezia Porto Marghera, before continuing to Venice proper).Not everyone chooses to stay in Venice. And if informed, then that's their decision.But if someone decides not to base in Venice, then it was suggested to base in a town that would at least be enjoyable for those hours you're not in Venice.Treviso is exactly the town I had in mind if one were to decide not to base in Venice.But if you've journeyed from wherever to see and experience Venice, then perhaps first consider lodging within budget in Venice. Vagabonda"
"I would agree wholeheartedly with Vagabonda, but Mestre has it's fans fair enough I suppose,"
"I am simply challenging those who choose to put people off staying in Mestre when , although NOT Venice etc etc , is simply more than satisfactory and should not be characterised by highlighting ONLY the negatives.It is a world away from Venice but it has many places to stay and numerous places to eat with a wonderful, helpful, kind and happy Italian population whose company we enjoyed- I have made it clear that it is not a 'destination' in itself but it's proximity to Venice and indeed the town's central area makes it perfectly acceptable overall.We loved our visit to Venice, thankfully out of season,but the crowds were still there, evenings also, we enjoyed returning to Mestre to dine at places the locals enjoyed- without the crowds!!Finally- I have NEVER challenged anyones right to say anything but simply posted my alternative views,challenging those who , I believe,have concentrated on the negatives."
"I agree with Vagabonda and latrevisana 100%. Why stay in gloomy Mestre? If not in Venice (and staying in Venice is an obvious choice), travelers can stay in lovely Lido and take vaporetto to Venice - we enjoyed our boat trips and absolutely loved Lido. My friend stayed in Lido in May this year and was very happy there. Once, we stayed in Padua and took a train to Venice for a day trip (was not our first trip to Venice). Padua is a wonderful town to explore: beautiful architecture, vibrant market and a real not to be missed treasure: “Cappella degli Scrovegni” with its unique Giotto’s frescoes. And it takes 26 minutes to get from Padua to Venice on a train, which runs frequently. Mestre was a dump many years ago and sounds like it is still a dump. I hope all readers of this thread will understand it after very detailed Vagabonda’s, latrevisana’s and MomCat’s posts and will not pay too much attention to very questionable and low budget choices made by Tipper r."
"NEVER challenged anyone's right to say anything.....Really?Perhaps a re-read!If readers are put off with Mestre, it's because of Mestre itself.Only the negatives weren't highlighted.The ONE pretty area in town has been discussed, so it wasn't all negative.If I'm planning holiday time from work, anticipating and saving for a holiday, I would surely expect more than satisfactory.Yes Nora, there are alternatives like Padova, and even Lido, the islands, or Cannaregio.Vagabonda"
"I am at a loss to understand what would motivate those, indeed I find it rather disturbing, the wholly unnecessary lengthy responses, posted simply to degenerate a place where thousands of people live and enjoy their lives, going about their daily lives to. None wearing banners saying 'I want out' and there are no long lines of residents leaving!!- and a community where an obvious widespread of incomes exist.I have never said Mestre is without it's peers simply that it is an acceptable place adjacent to Venice.The implication that it is sort by, or suitable only for the poor, is insulting to those, in their thousands who choose Mestre, being on a budget is not a crime!!(I stayed in an Airbnb with 3/4 hundred five 'star' approvals - all poverty stricken idiots it is implied!!)A perusal of the above will reveal those whose desire to condemn is lacking in rationality- why persist, particularly in such lengthy negative responses, to someone who is simply saying Mestre IS acceptable alternative.I cannot compete with such disturbing irrationality so therefore i'm out-"
"I really think this thread has run its course, there are always going to be people for and against,"
I agree Sophie8- I have fought the good fight for Mestre but I must now move on- Tipper R
"It just isn't possible for some to stay on topic, and to present information and opinions without personal attacks.Italians, including Italians from Vento have accurately and honestly describe Mestre.As Dhmellor indicated back on Post n°14, "" Look at where respondents (no 12 and 13) live, and you can easily work out which of them knows what he is talking about.""Vagabonda"
"Vagabonda- your persistent negativity reveals a serious flaw in your make up- Enough!!I offer you (and others) a constructive example for future use;......….Hi Tipper - Mestre is convenient for Venice but many would say it ends there! Although hundreds do choose to stay in Mestre year after year and it does have nice places in and around the town centre, where the locals stroll & dine quite happily, but there are alternatives places to stay (i.e. such as …) which I/we think would be nicer because....''This is a far more positive approach than simply advising all and sundry to boycott Mestre by concentrating ONLY on exaggerated negatives- as if it is only fit for paupers and idiots. I doubt if any visitors to Mestre will seek accommodation in the local cement works!I will not respond to any future comments as I do not wish to engage with those whose enthusiasm for the negative overrides objectivity!"
"The enthusiasm for negativity persists, disturbingly so, highlighting the negatives of a town where thousands of honest decent people live contentedly, whilst so determinedly, ignoring the positive attributes enjoyed by those same people. Thousand's of visitors have stayed in Mestre over the years hence the abundance of various accommodations made available to them- yet some imply only the foolish & paupers would choose do so.I will not engage further on this subject."
"Thank you, obviously you have trouble reading our posts and only your opinion should matter according to you. You seem to be easily disturbed when people express their opinions different from yours.Every time I have been to Mestre I have encountered mostly non-locals, there on business or other reasons, not last supplying labor to the numerous industries.You have been repeating the same routine for several posts now, going on about normal people doing their thing happily in Mestre. What's that got to do with people who spend good money to see and visit one of the most famous towns in the world? You would prefer going to Mestre and watching locals drinking their espresso at a bar? How is that a desirable trait to decide where to spend your evenings and nights? If you could lay out the facts, and not sugar coat everything, you would be more credible. Are Italians like zoo animals to you, you just enjoy watching us just because? And are you ignoring the fact that the walk to Piazza Ferretto from train station is not desirable, or are you purposely coating Mestre with a pink cloud of coziness?I am trying to avoid sending visitors to Mestre, (the town of happy people going about their business), afraid that they will be disappointed. Much prefer to describe what I see every time I go to Mestre and let them decide for themselves. You are also putting words into our mouths. I don't see any reference to ""paupers"", ""foolish"", etc. except from you."
Latrevisana Oh dear me- Nothing I have said would justify the extrapolations you have made-An exceptionally silly post lacking in grammar (from someone who should know better!!) and also lacking maturity..
"There appears confusion between objectivity in describing a place, and negativity.Mestre was described as it is.These are travel forums providing information about travel, and for tourists.It isn't the job or responsibility of a travel forum to fight a good fight for a town.But to provide information for tourists about a place, and trust each reader's good sense to decide for themselves.Facts are facts, and opinions might differ, but there's no justification for personal attacks.No member has the right to personally judge another member, nor indicate what that member should write nor how they should phrase posts.Vagabonda"

"Hello,  how did your stay in mestre go? we're going this may and I wanted to know about the safety in mestre. thank you"
"Hello, How was your stay in Mestre? We're considering staying in mestre for our short visit to venice and I wanted to ask about the safeness of the area. thank you"
"Ditto chefathome!There's convenience for the airport (at times).Mestre is economical.It depend when, and the cycle of law enforcement raids on Mestre.But if you're anticipating an experience to enjoy Venice............Mestre is not (historical) Venice.As chefathome wrote, ""Venice is...Venice. Nothing else is.""For sure that is true as Venice is the blend of East and West, unique, one of a kind, and a magical place on earth!""Vagabonda"
"As a poster on these forums likes to state that Venice and Mestre can't be compared, well it's perhaps the only truth that he writes.You can't possible compare Venice to Mestre.Vagabonda"
"Spot on Nora!!This ongoing saga between Venice and Mestre is really staggeringly amazing.There is only one Venice.It's understandable that budget constraints might ""force"" under duress a look and consideration at Mestre even if Venice is possible on a budget, but if you have gone so far for Venice, why would you stay in Mestre?And if the explanation is for locals and local experiences....Well that's also all possible in Venice, and also at more charming towns nearby to Venice than Mestre.Vagabonda"
"It's staggering to think that some save for a holiday, anticipate Venice, and then because of budget end in Mestre.Stay in Venice even on a budget.Venice is magical at night and in the early morning without day trippers.Mestre is depressing.Even if you believe that your budget can't afford Venice, which isn't true as there are also less expensive, less touristy, and more local areas of Venice, there are other genuine and lovely towns like Treviso to enjoy.I would sell my soul for a budget room in Venice before ever staying in Mestre!Vagabonda"
"Hi I'm back...& Happy New Year to all.....To whom it may concern....We have travelled On Concorde/Cunard liners/Best hotels in the world-visited all continents and dozens of countries- we stayed in Mestre...for 4/5 nights and loved the fact that we were with the locals, did not see any of the so called 'Industry etc - NO CRIME, we felt safe all the times=many local non touristy eaterys of all shapes & sizes etc etc watch the locals strolling by enjoying their town= NOTE - Notice the absence of any Q's of locals trying to get out!!We did love Venice but goodness me, we were glad we ignored the anti Mestre brigade comments and got away from the Venice crowds in the evening-Yes there are nice places to eat but oh dear me, such is the beauty of Venice that it is production line catering- everywhere is so busy- eating outside is of course popular...as the 1000's upon 1000's walk by gawping at you- and don't forget when a cruise ship or two - or more unload the 1000's of people into the streets with their tour guides ushering several dozen plus at a time down narrow streets - 'ahoy there - stand aside.....you won't need prompting!Venice is beautiful enjoy it - stay where you choose in or outside but please don't be guided solely by those who seem to wish to hold onto a somewhat blinkered view of their, perhaps limited travel experiences!Best wishes to all-& before you start - Cunard & Concorde- fantastic!"
">>we were glad we ignored the anti Mestre brigade comments and got away from the Venice crowds in the evening<<The point is that Venice is not crowded in the evening, after the cruise passengers and day-trippers leave. That is why it is a good idea to stay in Venice rather than Mestre: you get to see Venice in the calm of the evening."
"Sydneynick- sadly not our experience as we did try it- but yes of course far fewer numbers than during the day= Obviously lots of people enjoy such evening dinning experiences - we don't, hence our take on what we found..best wishes"
"I've yet to ever read a post on TA from a local saying they want ""to get out"" of where they live; they just don't say that sort of thing - not on a travel forum. They live where they live, they are not visiting there.Venice is one of those places that I really think if you can't afford to stay there - in it - wait until you can but as has been pointed out, there are many price points in Venice and lower priced accommodations can be found to have the full feast of the experience of Venice which is, as noted, early morning, later at night when cruise ship and other day trippers have left.There is so much of Venice that - even in high season - you can get away from the massive crowds - but, seemingly everyone needs to go to the same handful of areas/spots in the city, overwhelming them when within a few minutes walk, you can be in a quiet, off the side area along smaller canals with few people around.And, this is coming from someone who isn't a big fan of the city - but, I do appreciate its stunning uniqueness, history, architecture, beauty and my absolute favorite moments were just around dawn and after 10 p.m. and later - just wow. Nothing like it. It's the silence that is so captivating from lack of vehicular traffic and when away from the Grand Canal - Nowhere like it.To have to leave it to go back to Mestre would depress the heck out of me - I don't much care who is eating in a restaurant I'm in as long as the food is good; so locals, tourists, I don't care. If I want a local experience primarily, I wouldn't go to Venice (and certainly not Mestre) - I'd do - as I do - go to some of the many untouristy areas in Italy where you have a very different sort of experience. (The only places I mention in posts on TA in any forum are those that are mostly well-known; the less touristy places I visit, I don't talk about - and, weirdly, have actually been asked to not mention on public forums by some locals in a few places as they want to remain under the radar as much as is even possible in these days of global information online)Glad you enjoyed Mestre....and if one doesn't like wandering nighttime then Venice may well not be that special place for someone"
"Hi momcatt 1992Re. ' 'Q's of people wanting to get out'- not to be taken literally but it's implication - i.e., folk seem happy with their surroundings- but thank you for a very balanced response made without the rancour some seem so ready to indulge in, thereby diminishing the very credibility of their posts! -(Hi Vagabonda!!)"
"Inaccurate information diminishes credibility.It is the early morning and later at night when cruisers and other day trippers have left that Venice is most special. Day trippers contribute to the crowds, don't experience Venice at its best, and then report that Venice is crowded. Go to less touristy and beautiful areas of Italy for local experiences and encounters with locals.But if you want to experience Venice, then stay in Venice.Vagabonda"
"There area in Venice that are not crowded. You just did the major tourist sights apparently.Glad you enjoyed your Mestre trip.I for one, prefer Venice..."
"We took advice and stayed in Venice..last Weekend.WE loved it..walked around at nights in peace, ate local, enjoyed the whole atmostphereWe felt relaxed and very safe"
"Thanks ever so much for reporting back heblady.So you loved Venice, and enjoyed the atmosphere!Happily your decision to stay in Venice was a good choice for you.Best regards,Vagabonda"

"Vagabonda, You've almost single handedly keeping the 'ongoing saga' on Mestre / Venice going with your embittered observations about Mestre.Absolutely, there is only one Venice, no one here disputes that. Nobody goes to Mestre for the buildings, culture etc etc.... they'd be daft if they did :-)However, Mestre is a good base from which to visit Venice... and also from which to head over to Padua, Vicenza, Treviso etc. Granted, the area around the train station and the first 100-200 metres of Via Popolo and Piave aren't anywhere I'd choose to stay, but the area up and around Piazza Ferretto is absolutely fine and as safe as anywhere in most towns. We've stayed in Mestre several times and don't do it 'under duress' or due to (financial ) constraints. We do it because we prefer not to be in the thick of things and pick and choose our times to visit Venice. Early morning and late evening are great times, you're right..... some days we visit Venice, other days we don't see Venice at all other than passing through on the way to one of the outlying islands where you can escape the crowds or take the train and head further afield.Ceratinly, if Venice is a 'once in a lifetime' trip then I'd say grab the experience and stay in Venice itself if that's what you prefer to do. Personally, we like the idea of staying off island ( having ensured we're staying somewhere that suits our needs ) and heading in to Venice as and when we want. I have no doubt that following our next visit for 10 days in November 2019 - we've planned it for the Biennale - we'll love it just as much as the first time and will head back home ready to book our next visit, and our preferred choice of where to stay will again be Mestre where, as ever, we will stay in a wonderful apartment in a tree lined street just beyond Piazza Ferretto.I would agree though.... staying around the train station area would not be my choice of place to stay, either."
AllthingsItalySo eloquently put- on the button Re Mestre and Venice.Why some persist on denigrating Mestre so is rather sad- sad in that they do so. I received one such reply insisting that S/he did not meet any locals in Mestre just foreign workers...why make such outlandish comments when the town has a population of tens of thousands-did S/he go around asking ''where are you from''!!
