"the Investigative Discovery channel, part of the Discovery network, is airing an episode of their series Gang Nation on july 14th at 10pm and again at 1am on 7/15... the brief episiode description on the website says only this ""Ross Kemp infiltrates the criminal underworld in Kingston, Jamaica, which is known as the murder capital of the world.""should be an interesting episode!"
"this sounds really familiar... if it is what i'm seeing... 1) most on these boards won't like it too much, and 2) it should be on youtube.. i've seen it in a few places on facebookChelle"

"This was on a few years back, interesting program to be honest - yep its about, the drugs, deaths and gangs. But its reality - its filmed in an area 99.9% of tourists will never go and most will never hear about.The Jamaica episode is not half as bad as some of the other ones. Ross Kemp is very good - if you have never read his book Ross Kemp Gangs, then do its a good read - anybody wanting a read give me a shout - for some reason i have 3 copies of the book - more than happy to post them out :)"
"I too have seen this episode. As a matter of fact my fiance' DVR'ed it so that I could see it prior to our trip.It has some very alarming information on it, like neighborhood beheadings and numerous shoot outs, BUT as mentioned, this is not an area where any tourist would or should find themselves.You can get this kind of alarming information in just about any major city in the U.S., not just Kingston. I have friends who have spent quite a bit of time in Kingston and they mentioned that anyone with some common sense is really quick to know where you should or should not go, just like you were in Detroit or New Orleans."
"""neighborhood beheadings""i'm pretty sure i watched the entire episode and that didn't come up... it's been awhile since i've seen it, but i'm not remembering that at all...that sort of activity isn't at all common to jamaica, maybe you've confused it with another episode?Chelle "
"Ross Kemp does an excellent job in exposing the crimminal world activities. The episode on Jamaica is very good and interesting.People must remember what's discussed is happening in many countries, not in the tourist areas and the series shows that Jamaica is not the worst."
"One of the young women mentioned that recently someone had ""Crossed the top of the hill"" to the wrong side of the neighborhood and the gangsters ""cut off their head."" She was explaining that it wasn't due to political agenda as Ross thought, but merely a ""turf war."""
"Again, I'm not trying to shed a bad light on Jamaica, just merely telling what i saw on the show. As it has been mentioned there are places as bad or worse than this in the U.S."
I watched this a long time ago but I don't remember any 'beheadings'?I agree tho..Ross Kemp...does a great job on his 'gang' series of shows..He recently did 'Ross Kemp in Afghanistan'...also excellent ......xxx
"i'll watch it again tonite... possibly just a misunderstood accent/expression? dunno... it's just not something that happens there (maybe a sick individual that does sick things, but those types exist everywhere, i can say with some confidence, beheadings are NOT something that occur on any regular basis in jamaica at all)Chelle "
Well...unless you're a chicken......then you in big trouble....lololxxx
"Personally, there are some places in backwoods Arkansas that I felt more threatened than any country that I have ever traveled to.There's nothing more scary than stumbling across someone's apparent Meth Lab while going out on a cross country run."
"No beheadings - i re read this chapter in the book last night and it wasnt mentioned.Love the Ross Kemp looking for pirates, that was on fr the past few weeks - he is a brave man really :) "
"66 people were shot in Chicago last weekend, that doesnt mean dont go to Chicago though as tourists would have no reason to be in Englewood or the projects.Also, there was an incident on the East Coast of the US earlier this year where a guy had his head cut off on the bus, media didn't report it though. Like everyone else said, most tourists would not go anywhere near these areas and the same can be said of most any major city, not just in Jamaica."
"""Also, there was an incident on the East Coast of the US earlier this year where a guy had his head cut off on the bus, media didn't report it though. ""dude weas probably snoring to the point someone just had to get him quiet .... so kids what did we learn..dont fall asleep on the bus and dont run with scissors "
There must be a epidemic of beheadings on busses. A poor young man was beheaded on a Greyhound bus in Manitoba last year.So don't ride busses.
"It is funny how everyone can take one part of a statement and run with it and blow it completely out of proportion.When the topic was brought up about the show, I mentioned that it discussed multiple shootings and even beheadings. It was not an attempt to keep people from traveling to Jamaica, but merely a statement of what the show touches on.I recorded the replay of it last night and it did indeed talk about a young man who rode his bicycle across the hill to buy food in a neighborhood in Kingston and to quote his friend ""They cut him head all off."" Maybe it was not in ""the book"" or it was missed, but it is there. I was not implying that this is commonplace in Kingston, but it was a valid part of the show that it touches on about 20 minutes in. There is no need for translation when recalling a quote from a show and a distinct point that they were trying to discuss by putting it in the airing.If you choose to think that the mention of this act was a way to somehow shed a poor light on Kingston, then you are incorrect. But I think that enough is said considering Ross was investigating the ""Murder Capital of the World."" "
"LOL - I read the subject line too fast and actually thought it read ""ganja nation"" and was surprised it was still on the board!! : )"
Beheading is NOT a common thing in Jamaica..it is a very rare thing that ever happens....one or two isolated incidents certainly does not tell the true story...
"ok.. i watched the video online, and it's cut where you talk about on every copy i've seen... possibly because it was ""mistranslated""? or because it was just plain untrue... dunno... i've never seen it because it isn't in the widely circulated version on the net... it was cut for a reason that i'm not sure of... and to answer your question, the reason something such as a beheading would create a stir is because the connotations behind it... it's an act that is often associated with kidnapping, ransom, often notoroiously broadcasted, often involving people foreign to the nations the incidents happen in... not saying that's the only type, but many people have visions of new reporters begging for their lives for the camera... Jamaica is NOT that type of place at all... i can only assume that's why people get defensive when it's spoken of... ah wellChelle"
"I was just caught off guard a bit when everyone seemed to believe I was taking crazy pills. I too started to believe that maybe I had misheard it. But that is the full episode that is being broadcast on the Discovery Channel. It is odd that it is cut on the net, because it is quite an intriguing discussion with the group in that particular neighborhood.At no point do they say that beheadings are common place, but when Ross asked them about particular events within the neighborhood, they immediately brought the event up to show him exactly how scared they were to even cross the hill up the street."
Here is the uncut television version that is still on youtube. The conversation starts at about the 1:50 mark.www.youtube.com/watchâ€¦
"I just finsihed watching th 5 part series on youtube (Slow day at work). Very eye opening. Very sad. I have to say that Ross Kemp has some big kahunas for venturing on that turf. It seems that everyone there wants the violence to stop and change for the better, but they don't know how. Crazy, I just don't know what to say right now. "
"I have to concur with what BrahmaBull posted a few pages back. It's all in our own backyard as well. Some of us are closer to it then we think. It's even out in the ""Heartland"" of our country. JMO, but I think the media is not as quickly inclined to report on such things here unless they think it will draw advertiser $$. If you live in the Tri-state area of NY, NJ, & PA, years ago you would hear about murder, rape, & robbery/assault almost every night on your local news. It became so mundane they started reporting other things, too. It just wasn't new ""news"" anymore. It was a given.There's so many parts of Newark, NJ, & all over different areas of Philly & N.Y.C where you could get your throat cut for the ten bucks you might have in your pocket. So what does one do? Just don't go there."

it was...i recorded it
ugh...jamaica still have flaws...no need to cover it up...i don't disagree with the tv series....i know the country very well...it is true
"I just watched this documentary and as I Jamaican I am filled with mixed emotions.My family is from the country and the level of violence is not like it is in the Cities. Kingston has always been know to be violent. When I am in Jamaica I try to stay as far away from Kingston as possible. However, violence is everywhere. Right now a lot of the cities in the US experience violence at the same level if not worst. I stay away from most places in Philly, because there is not a day that pass that someone is not killed. Jamaica is a small place, with a lot of killing, so it is going to seen more magnified. I do believe that the government and the communities are the only ones that can make any difference. I do home one day that all of this madness will decrease, but if nothing is done, it will only get worst. Thanks Rawlus...for letting know about this show."
