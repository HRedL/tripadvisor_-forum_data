"I suppose to depart on 16 Feb to Osaka. I planned to visit Kyoto and Osaka. However, is it still safe to visit Osaka due to Coronavirus outbreak?I know there is no definite answer for this question, but I'm keen to know how's the condition there, like is everyone wearing the mask? Do most attractions still open as usual?"
Here the news;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/…
The main discussion and all information you need is here https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29…It is forum policy not to create repeat posts
Many people in the Osaka and Kyōto areas are wearing masks now in public. Masks are sold out and hard to find. Things are still open as usual and students are still going to school.
This one has an axe to grind.
"#2 Thank you for the remind. Can you please enlighten me with the official link of the policy? Thanks and have a good day!Edited: 1:25 am, February 03, 2020 "
#3 Good to know that! Thank you.
"You’re 100% fine, Jane, that poster is wrong. I confirmed it. Duplicate posts by the same person aren’t allowed.Your post is on the same topic as some others but your questions aren’t the same and it doesn’t matter. If this were an actual policy, people would not be allowed to ask a million similar questions about trains in Japan.Edited: 1:40 am, February 03, 2020 "
"The same questions get asked all the time and we answer them routinely. It's not a big deal as long as you aren't posting the same question multiple times or asking the same question despite having received answers in another thread already. Also, before people start acting like forum police, please cut the newbies some slack. If one feels the question is discussed in another thread already, it's just as easy to refer to that other thread without being critical."
Exactly. The boring topics get rehashed over and over again and that’s neither a problem nor a violation of some imaginary TripAdvisor policy made up by a delusional person who thinks she runs the show.
"Lol, Keith. You don’t mince words, do you. If a topic bugs you for any reason, just skip it. It’s as simple as that.,"
I am traveling to Tokyo on April 18th. I booked my flights with AirChina 2 months ago. I am taking a tour. I am not sure what I should do. I have layover in Beijing and then to Tokyo. AirChina is refunding my ticket fare but my tour company won’t.
Where is your tour company based?
"Many people in Japan wear masks, long before this thing about Coronavirus. So don't worry if you feel like wearing one. I wore one last month when I visited Japan, first time ever for me. But I didn't feel standing out, as about half of people in the subway station were wearing theirs. One thing I did not know before hand was that those face masks sure made me feel warmer in chilly weather."
Thank you! Will definitely wear mask and avoid crowded places.
hi jane. i think by now u would be in osaka. i sent you a private text. did u get it?are u ok. and hows the situation there.
Dear Jane!! What about Osaka? Are turist places crowed ? I am traveling to Osaka by the 12th of March. Is it necessary to wear mask? Thanks.
Mask prevents you from being a spreader. This is the main advantage of wearing a mask.
"OSAKA was very busy and crowded last night. It seemed like it always is. Not everyone is wearing masks. Cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping areas were busy."
"Hi, did you go ahead with your Osaka trip? I am supose to leave on 22 Feb with my daughter. Just keen to find out the situation there now. Thanks."
"hello jane, are you in osaka now? me and my mom are also scheduled to go to kansai region this end of march, really worried too. as of late there has been one case each in kyoto and osaka and nara.Edited: 9:04 pm, February 19, 2020 "
"Are you talking abou the cases reported in January while many from Wuhan were still coming?The two Chinese, one store clerk and one student from Wuhan, reported in Kyoto got over it already. Also the Chinese tour guide living in Osaka and the Nara bus driver already recovered.Now only individual Chinese tourists are coming to Japan, no Chinese group tour any more.Edited: 9:09 pm, February 19, 2020 "
"Rather than listening to total strangers on this forum with no medical knowledge, follow the directions given by appropriate agencies such as the US CDC:https:/…index.html""Other Destinations with Apparent Community SpreadJapanSingaporeSouth KoreaTaiwanThailandVietnamCommunity spread means people have been infected with the virus, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. At this time, the extent of virus spread is not sustained or widespread enough to meet the criteria for a travel notice. If that changes, CDC will update this page.""Pay attention * At this time, the extent of virus spread is NOT sustained or widespread enough to meet the criteria for a travel notice.*"
"Dear all, I had cancelled my trip after reconsidering about the possibility to get infected or carry the virus back to my own country. Hope everyone stays safe!"
"""Pay attention * At this time, the extent of virus spread is NOT sustained or widespread enough to meet the criteria for a travel notice.*""Look, I understand people want to grandstand about this issue, but the truth is that there's always going to be a degree of guesswork involved in this. If your trip is next week and you're planning to stay in Japan for three weeks, for instance, then the fact that there is no travel notice today doesn't mean you shouldn't be thinking about cancelling/rescheduling your trip. You're basically guessing about what the situation will be like a month from now and there's no easy answer to that. It's not even about the chance of getting coronavirus itself, you're also weighing up the fact many events have already been cancelled in Japan and the possibility that while you're here there might be a spike like we've seen in Korea that makes things difficult for you to travel to other countries when you leave.Pretending this is all easy and that we just need to follow the directions of official agencies isn't greatly helpful. It isn't an easy situation and people have to weigh up their individual circumstances/risks before they decide to travel. I can perfectly understand why many people have cancelled trips."
