"I have a brilliant idea! Why not cancel all travel plans, get refunds on prepaid trips where possible, forget about any plans for travel, until the virus has been declared over? This will eliminate the worry and stress involved in trying to get answers. There are so many more useful ways to pass the time. No need to research. We will be well informed when it is safe. No risks. No stress. Travel is the biggest source for spreading the virus. The sooner we all cooperate the sooner it will be over. Why do so many feel the need to test the limits of everything, like little children."
"As Kansas said 'we are not all the same'. I need to know what is over that next mountain, across that large lake or even ocean. I enjoy seeing what is around the next curve. I enjoy the ability to meet that next person.Occupation caused me to start my travels and once so they became infectious. I enjoy travel. I enjoy the plan for travel. I enjoy discussing my and your travels. They have been and hopefully will continue to be an enjoyable portion of my life. I can survive without travel. I can survive without steak or ice cream, but I have no desire to do so as long as I can acquire them.O P, . You cease your travels and aid in the defeat of COVID 19 in your way and I am sure that those of us who care to continue our travels will find other ways to defeat COVID19."
"{Why not cancel all travel plans, get refunds on prepaid trips where possible, forget about any plans for travel, until the virus has been declared over?}Because that ""brilliant idea"" only works if you are willing (perhaps) to never travel again in your lifetime. This virus may never be ""declared over""."
"I've replaced my trip this month to Vallarta with a little getaway to the Texas coast. It won't be the same but its a beach, I can support local businesses and we can get there by car. Starting with a few nights in Galveston and then heading down the coast from there unplanned. Should be interesting. Pretty much the closest thing to a getaway I can do with little planning and no worries."
"503lovepv I agree with you. I can stay here and be happy in my home and on my large property, pretty remote from others. I know not everyone has such an opportunity, but the fact I like where I live, the weather is good, I will be fine here hopefully for as long as it takes for this virus to at least almost disappear. Which may be a year, nobody knows.I dont care to risk my health on an airplane to anywhere. If we do go somewhere, it'll be by car, which will limit travel, but for now, that's ok. As much as I love to travel, especially to a small place in particular in Mexico, I can wait. Yeah, I dont want to wait, but I will. It beats the alternative."
"I'm happily settled in. Lucky to have a spacious home to roam in - great kitchen to brush up my rusty baking skills. Spring weather has me a little twitchy to get out and about. Ah, to sit on a lovely patio with a crisp rosé. That looks like a possibility here if everything doesn't get burned down. Crazy times. I'm fairly confident that I'll make it back to Vallarta in due time. No desire to go under current conditions. If people want to plan trips they probably won't realistically be taking to pass the time and dream of better days I say ""go for it"". We all need distractions and dreams."
"503lovepv - OPI don't think it is a brilliant idea. I think it is short sighted.The travel industry is vital to the economy. Not just Puerto Vallarta, but world wide.We will get through this. Travel won't ever be the same, but it will continue.You may wish to stay home. I respect your right to do that, but I also respect others right to travel.Each person has to decide for themselves."
Hate to break it to you but the Covid virus isn't going to disappear overnight. It takes a very long time for any virus to disappear. Swine flu virus is still around after 11 years or so. The common flu virus has been around for a very long time. It is very hard to tell which virus will be here a short time or be with us until the end of time.
"I don't disagree with the sentiment Timothy but I do think at some point during pandemics we need to reassess our definition of ""rights"" of the individual when they infringe on the rights of others. Your right to travel doesn't trump (sorry to use that word in this context) my right to continue to draw breath. Let's face it - the planet is overpopulated (Mother Nature is pointing that out in spades at the moment with the more densely populated cities suffering the worst Covid devastation) and if every one of the 7.6 billion humans on this planet decide to invoke their individual rights vs having some concern for the rights of the many we're gonna be in real trouble."
{Mother Nature is pointing that out in spades at the moment with the more densely populated cities suffering the worst Covid devastation}I don't think that is Mother Nature speaking. Would you have said that about the AIDS epidemic? Didn't think so :(
"Well stated Timothy.Fred, I don't think that he was proposing that travelers violate any laws or regulations while traveling (which by definition means that they are not infringing on your ""rights""). If you have a risk tolerance that drives you to continue to isolate beyond what is required , go for it. But it doesn't work the other way...you don't get to dictate what other people do or don't do, given that they are respecting the laws and regulations active at a particular point in time within a given jurisdiction. If you think that things should be different, for the greater good of the world, those are only your thoughts."
"OP...your idea is based on a wrong premise...travel is causing the spread of the virus from one country to the other,but only if people traveling don't take any precautions...let's not forget that most cases happened after international travel has stopped ...so, please stop with the nonsense...your post reminds me of a similarly ludicrous post from a few months ago by someone decreeing the death of the all inclusive buffets ... OP...how are you with brilliant ideas , because you can forget this one...?Edited: 1:29 pm, May 31, 2020 "
"The way HIV is spread is very different than the way Covid is spread. Over history the biggest and most lethal pandemics have always disproportionately impacted densely populated urban areas - i.e., the black plague and Spanish flu. Not sure animals really thrive in dense proximity in any case. You notice the last several have originated in China (11.6 million in Wuhan for example)."
"No, nobody is talking about not taking precautions or doing as instructed. And I can't see a moment when we will be suddenly informed it's safe and there is no risk or stress. This is about time imo. Can you wait forever, 2 years, 5 years before you go on with your life?It does seem like a few people think the threat will only be around for a year. Even with the best scientists and labs in the world working on this, all wanting the golden money a solution will bring, these things take time, years. As long as there is no solution, it only takes contact with one person, so it will be up to us to decide for ourselves when it's even safe to go to a local restaurant anywhere that is legally open.   So, to me much of being satisfied with being on our property depends on how long we're talking about?  I love my home too, we're on acreage and I even have a pool. But staying on my property indefinitely won't work.  Things are about as indefinite as it gets right now."
"{lethal pandemics have always disproportionately impacted densely populated urban areas} Well obviously. That only makes sense for something transmitted person to person by air or contact.My point is I do not believe ""Mother Nature"" is behind covid purposely thinning out the world's population. Any more than I believe ""god"" was behind AIDS/HIV as punishment to gay people. Just watch those theories you're tossing around."
"So many great answers. I survived2travel, not because I do not like my home, but I like the planning, the dreaming, the scheduling of seeing friends, the waiting for that flight to artive with my husband or children and grandchild. I like the dreaming, I am okay for now to stay put but only because I have Hope for the future."
"Deanna...you're right, it's not only debatable, but it's completely wrong...travel will resume much sooner than OP wants or thinks, but probably won't be as enjoyable as before, however there are people who worked hard all this time and would want to do something else than to sit at home and wait for everything to pass on their well deserved holiday..."
"A point I haven't seen mentioned. Most of the tourists (at this time of year) they are trying to discourage are Mexicans. It wouldn't be the smartest political move to say, ""Those tourists from places where citizens are practicing safe distancing are welcome. Those who are not, are not welcome. Most Mexicans are not practicing safe social distancing. Therefore, most Mexican tourists are not welcome"".Not gonna be a winning policy for any politician in Mexico."
"Fred T #9I agree an individuals right to travel does not supersede the rights of others to maintain a safe environment, but where do we draw the line?If someone wants to travel and travel is permitted; shouldn't they be allowed to do so?I recognize regulations must be followed and enforced, but once travel is legally permitted; I feel individuals should decide for themselves.Like you; I am a strong proponent of subjugating the rights of the individual to protect the rights of the majority, but at some point an individuals right to lawfully travel must be recognized and respected.Personally, I feel the world is opening up too quickly. I understand and appreciate the economic impact the pandemic has had worldwide, but I would like it to stay the course for a while longer.Lives are more important."
"I think it will be beyond anyone's control to stop it. For instance you want to go on a boat, any boat, VA, Wildlife discovery, a fishing boat....here is what is currently required. Every passenger must have their temp. Taken, they must step on a decontamination mat getting on the boat, they must have a mask, the boat must cleaned with a Govt. Specified decontamination cleaner, everyone must have or be furnished with a mask, gel hand sanitizer must be on the boat, every boat can only carry 50% of the passengers they are licensed to carry. Every boat must be sprayed with a decontaminant OK...feeling pretty safe right? Until you get off the boat at the first stop and someone walks up without a mask and encroaches on your social distancing. Are they sick, are they asymptomatic and not showing symptoms yet but still contagious. When will you really be safe. Take the same conditions to any restaurant, grocery store, restaurant anywhere in the world...all bets are off. All it takes is one person. We have to get food, go to the dr. to get gas in our cars, etc. we are at just as much risk at home as we are anywhere else our travels, daily or long distance take us. Ask yourself again, when can I safely leave my safe place and venture anywhere else?My answer is when ""I"" feel comfortable, under ""my"" specific conditions feel safe to do so. I know I can never depend on another individual to keep me safe from Covid.Edited: 5:50 pm, May 31, 2020 "

Because we want to travel and be in PV
You are certainly welcome to cancel your travel plans and shelter in place to ride out the Covid19 Storm. PV and the beautiful Bahia will be here doing our best to welcome visitors when they feel safe enough to travel. Those of us who live here are doing exactly what you do but in our beautiful surroundings. We are all in the same storm but in different boats.
"Well said, 25. I’m not sure why the OP is concerned how people “pass the time”? For me, part of the travel experience (which I truly enjoy) is the planning and research, which is the purpose of the TA website. Maybe I should ask OP “why are you passing the time on a travel planning website when you have no intent to travel anytime soon?”."
"My issue is I don't believe it is going to be ""declared over"" or ""be over"" any time soon. And I agree why post to say you want to stay home. Just stay home. No one's stopping you."

Like so many others who have posted that they hope to return to PV in the next 8 months or so I am also hoping to be be able to return for the winter as we have done for the past 35 years. (We have spent about 5 years in PV over that time). The thought of having to stay home in cold Canada is a little depressing! Unless there is a vaccination it will not be easy to return and our insurance will not cover us so if we get sick it would be expensive. Keeping our fingers and toes crossed!Feel especially sorry for the Mexican people who count on all the tourists.
"Good points made, 27 & 28. We all have to live our lives knowing the virus is present & it will remain present for an unforeseen period of time. We will all make our own decisions about resuming everything from traveling to eating in a hometown restaurant.I know I should just scroll on by a lot of posts, but I find it frustrating to see judgmental comments being shared about those planning travel on a travel planning website."
The last 10 comments have all been well written and seemingly well thought out. I hope that many of the naysayers read them.I agree that it is our decision and only ours that we should trust. From staying locked in our homes and having groceries delivered to taking longer travels such as to Puerto Vallarta. I will not say that you are wrong to stay close to your home if you will not say I am wrong when I feel it is safe to travel to for instance Puerto Vallarta.
"Since we have lately been seeing crowds of folks out and about with no social distancing and very few masks being used correctly, I am wondering if the virus will remain the same, skyrocket or go down. If it goes down or even stays the same, that should bring some hope of better days to come, sooner rather than later."
"Nobody knows if the virus infections will increase, or hold steady or go down.Even the experts seems to be in disagreement on every issue from hydroxychloroquine to antibodies/vaccines to masks. I think there is a lot of lockdown fatigue going on because we can't just shut down the world indefinitely due to the economic and psychological effects...Edited: 6:34 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"I am hanging onto that huge word HOPE too, kansas. I think if you want to travel and it is allowed by departing and arribing places then do so. For now my backyard with another non furry being (like not a dog), would be awesome. I wish someone had that crystal bell..sadly right now cases as going up and up dalily in PV and all of Jalisco. sigh. Keep Hoping!!"
"Okay, so I read all of the responses and because I’m not given to lengthy futile dialogue, I will just say that as I was reading, words like Poetic, contentious, intelligent, argumentative, justification, futility. I’ve concluded that some of us are very opinionated and not given to common sense. So be it. Travel away. I hope when you arrive in PV ahead of time, you will enjoy the empty restaurants, businesses and beaches. To some of you, were I in close proximity, I hope we could share a big warm hug. I think you might know who you are. Happy (all in good time I hope) travels to all. I hope your dreams come true."
"503lovepv....I don't think you understand what you said originally in your OP and how it came across. You accused us, TripAdvisor regulars, of being 'like children' for looking ahead and planning vacations. I don't think you have the right to tell people that they should ' forget about plans for travel' until the 'virus is declared over'. Who's the opinionated one here??Edited: 10:45 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"Snorkler is correct in his assessment of what you asked us. And what I read was people answering your question as to why we like planning or keeping our plans. I don't think anyone said they're going when as you say, there are empty restaurants, businesses, and the beaches are closed. I don't mean to sound snarky, so please correct me if I'm wrong. It sounded like you think covid will be over very soon, or within a year's time, so we're impatient children. But most answered in terms of covid lasting much longer than a year...more like years, so we will have to decide how to live our lives."
Or the one who lacks common sense for that matter..... OP is an awfully judgemental post IMHO.
"Perhaps I didn’t express myself clearly in my original post. I apologize for offending some. You are never snarky Kansas, certainly not on this forum. More of us should be as balanced as you are. But then again, life may not be as interesting. Hmmm.....Yes I have opinions, deeply held. And I’m also judgmental at times. For good reason. But common sense I have in spades. It is fun to read posts and responses sometimes and even heated, shall we say, debates, but when I read about how desperate some are to get to PV it really tests my patience. Just settle down and focus on something else. If we play it safe we will ALL get to PV sooner than later. Perhaps I’ll try to stop peeking into the forum until all systems are go. Then I won’t get annoyed. I know some of you are thinking “please do”. LolSee y’all in PV, sooner than later, if you behave."
"Kansas, thanks for the support, by the way I'm not a dude... I'm a chicka....lol.... 503lovepv, that does clarify things , I understand you are tired of the posts asking about openings, and such. I think we all want to return to PV as soon as we can, so it's frustrating."
"I think Kansas is right, it must be assumed people will be traveling to PV when bars, restaurants, beaches, etc are still closed, which is most likely not the case. For me, “common sense” is learning to live my life (safely) knowing the virus is still active with no guarantee it will ever go away."
"I believe for the most part, people on here are just ready to travel after the ordeal we have all gone through. But I also believe that like myself, we are doing careful dreaming. Because I look forward to going back to PV, doesn't mean I should be vilified for such dreams. And yes, I do have an opinion. But unlike someones description, I do have common sense. And I do believe most posters on here share that same quality. You bet I'm anxious and looking forward to our fall trip. But unlike in the past, we have not booked our airfare at this point. We are in the wait and see mode. Our winter stay is hopefully still a go. That airfare is booked, but can cancel if things are not going well in PV. So people all have dreams of traveling. If they didn't, there would be no need for sites like TripAdvisor. So if our dreams annoy you, don't read them, just move on. And don't forget to support the various food banks in Puerto Vallarta. It's been a tough time for most!"
"503 you said, ""Just settle down and focus on something else."" I wouldn't expect anything else but people focusing on Vallarta here, I mean well.... it's a travel forum for Vallarta lol. We're doing other things throughout the day. And it can be expected that people will lament not being able to go, it's the obvious place for it with other lovers of Vallarta. As far as being ""desperate"" to get there, there are most likely some people who are more emotionally attached to PV than others, for a variety of reasons. And there's nothing wrong with that. I know it is tightly woven into the fabric of my life for the past 32 years.snorkler I'm sorry for getting your gender wrong!Edited: 9:15 am, June 06, 2020 "
I’m glad I’m not the only one who finds it ironic that some folks seem aggravated about people planning vacations using a travel planning website/forum! Lol
That is a brilliant idea! Well said.
Oh you expressed yourself perfectly clearly. But why does what other people do concern you so? Not really any of your business. Stop with the judging.
"We will continue to plan, take advantage of good deals both on flights & at resorts , & will be some of the first on a flight when Mexico opens back up. Opens back up to us means; airports open, regular flights, resorts, bars, restaurants, beaches, shops, night clubs, Ports of call ect. all open.. These places have never been as safe from disease / viruses as they are right now.  For those of you who are not comfortable traveling, I urge you to stay home, we all have a different comfort level. Wash your hands & avoid the crowds. Safe travels  Life is good"
"""These places have never been as safe from disease / viruses as they are right now.""No idea what that means with respect to Vallarta right now. For example, Beaches are safe if they are closed? Yes. If people social distance? Yes, but they won't. Same with the other things that are likely to remain closed indefinitely."
"The impressive thing is that the beaches are closed except for fishermen. And the restaurants that have reopened are mostly empty. A Page in the Sun had 3 tables in use, and Los Arcos had several tables in use on the upper deck in spite of the construction noise down below. Both pools are open even though the hotel is closed. Langustinos had one table occupied.Being reopened is a joke because they cannot cover their costs. Piazetta was all ready with three waiters.The thing is it is no fun going out when you are the only ones there."
"Thanks WWW8.  This covid business has made some of us short tempered it seems. Some of you have chosen to misconstrue my post through your own slightly discolored lenses. Never mind, I’m happy and I hope you are. Kansas, I look forward to reading your trip report when you have returned from Puerto Vallarta when everything is opened up. It will be full of good news I’m sure. I hope you are one of the first to go. Suze yes, I have judged you to be contentious. Your folly, not mine. Try not to be so imperious. Keith thanks for your report.Srtraveller, I’m sorry you feel vilified. Not my intention.As our Health Minister, Dr.Bonnie Henry, has said from the beginning, be safe, be kind, be calm. Her policies have protected the citizens of British Columbia very well. Let’s do our part. Remember, we are all in this together.Over and out, PV forum buddies. Try to have a wonderful time until this thing has blown over and then we will all have more wonderful times in PV."

"Well now, there's a sweet surprise. Thank you kindly Carey0 .I don't understand coming onto a travel forum and telling everyone that they should cancel all travel plans. There must be ""many more useful ways"" to spend time than insulting and belittling people here."
"Some of us who post frequently and have for some time may disagree with each other on certain issues, but in the long run we all care about the Puerto Vallarta area and do respect each other even when we disagree. I find no reason for someone who is just bored to show disrespect for others.I personally don't care if some choose to never come again to Puerto Vallarta or travel anywhere for that matter. That is their choice. I don't care if they ever plan to drive across their city or buy groceries in the local supermarket. That is their choice. More power to them.I plan to return if possible in the fall and I do look forward to it. Most of my plans are made and my flight is booked and my hotel reservations are made, but I check on health reports, hotel openings, welfare of people that I know in Puerto Vallarta and just look forward to the trip. My trip this time will only be for two weeks, but the planning and looking forward to it will last much longer. This complete package will be my pleasure and as soon as I return home I will be planning my next visit to Puerto Vallarta.To each their own. Just please don't call names if you disagree."
"careyeroslib, To answer your question airports, airplanes, resorts, restaurants, shops, bars, nightclubs ect are all more conscious about disinfecting & cleaning than they have been for years, so if anyone is afraid of disease or the virus, yes it is probably safer to travel now than anytime in the past. Just read a very nice post from someone there now who is quite excited about seeing others booking their flights & accommodations. It won't be long before the flights are full again & things are back to semi normal Wash your hands, avoid the crowds, & get those vacations booked. Prices are rising daily. Safe travels Life is good"
"Pandemic. Peak not yet reached. Most locals don't wear masks except if they think someone in authority might be watching. By all means dream and plan vacations, but to say things are safer right now than ever is, with respect, wrong. Luckily all but a few restaurants and non-utilitarian stores remain closed indefinitely (bars, large gathering spaces, beaches, hotel pools, malls)"
"Dream, plan, hope, but please wait a bit longer before heading to PV. The state of Jalisco is only in Phase Zero which is stage for slow reopening of a few non essential things. Bars, clubs, anywhere where gatherings occur, beaches are CLosed, even roads heading into PV are closed for non essential travels ie: vacations. Careyersolib is totally correct in stating not to say it is safer than ever for it is not! Beaches and true tourism will not open until Phase 2 at least. Noncompliance of masks and social distancing throughout the whole state of Jalisco is a huge concern to many residents, dr's, and the governor. That is why phase zero was extended to June 15 from June 1st. The case numbers have not peaked and are rising daily. Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but that is the reality of PV a part of Jalisco. Of course plan those trips and keep looking forward to returning but to claim it is safer now, NOT. I have a July trip to PV planned, I am not holding high hopes on that, but who knows a surprise would be nice. Think more towards late summer, fall or later in planning."
"History repeats itself. This poem written in 1869, reprinted during 1919 Pandemic. This is Timeless....It was written in 1869 by Kathleen O’Mara:And people stayed at homeAnd read booksAnd listenedAnd they restedAnd did exercisesAnd made art and playedAnd learned new ways of beingAnd stopped and listenedMore deeplySomeone meditated, someone prayedSomeone met their shadowAnd people began to think differentlyAnd people healed.And in the absence of people whoLived in ignorant waysDangerous, meaningless and heartless,The earth also began to healAnd when the danger ended andPeople found themselvesThey grieved for the deadAnd made new choicesAnd dreamed of new visionsAnd created new ways of livingAnd completely healed the earthJust as they were healed."
"^ It was written in March 2020, by Kitty O'Meara, in response to our current crisis."
When the Virus hit it was a hard void to actually NOT plan a trip. I take multiple short trips a year be it solo/with husband/with elderly Mom. I love the whole process from gearing up to actually going. Sometimes I am so thankful to just get on a plane for some forced time out. For some of us it is essential for mental health to change our scenery completely on occasion. I always come back stronger to keep on handling Life's difficult tests. And...This Virus will be around a looong time. We have all seen what happens when one puts themselves on hold too long...
"If you say so GenXpat, I only quoted from the source that I was given. To me I doesn't matter much when or by whom I just think it hits home. It did seem older to me as it mentioned what happened when it was over."
"If you put the first few lines into a search engine, information about the author will pop up on a fact check. I easily found the same source that GenXpat quoted. That it was written in March 2020 but on Facebook was crediting the much older date."
"Well yes, I do think it's important to credit actual sources. This piece, like the other one CJ pasted here recently, has been circulating on FB for several weeks and the imaginary writer has been debunked multiple times. Most FB glurge is false or misattributed."
"If it legal to travel and you are willing to take the risk and also OK with beaches and pools being closed; by all means travel.Puerto Vallarta is not just beaches, it is also the beautiful people."

Dallas-I believe PVChick was referring to the protesters not being worried about Covid
"I think Mexico should be more concerned about U.S. citizens coming here than Canadian citizens until it is determined what the protests have done to the Covid situation. Either way though, there should be quarantines in place. Hopefully that will change in a few months."

"My biggest concern now with the virus picking up in PV, and just the nature of viral spread everywhere, is that I might be part of the spread. I definitely and whole heartedly want to be conscientious in how my travels (actions) impacts those I come in contact with.Wearing my mask properly, good hand washing, etc. are essential. Being fastidiously aware of how I might be the one to have come in contact with the virus and then Unknowingly be the one with the potential to spread it is my highest priority. I just traveled from PVR back to the States and I used the recommended protocols. Part of following the protocols is the responsibility to protect others from what I potentially came in contact with. I take this responsibility seriously as I don’t want my actions to put others in harms way."

"{if hundreds and even thousands can protest on street in US and nobody is worried about Covid, I think it’s time for me to decide what I want to do and that is come to PV}I agree that everyone needs to make their own decisions at this point in history.But to me the fact that people are protesting in the streets and taking chances by ignoring all the advised precautions... doesn't mean I get on a plane to Puerto Vallarta. I don't see the connection."
"With hundreds, even thousands protesting on the streets in the States, I thought that I might be safer in PV.  Now a friend in Mexico tells me of large protests in there . And they are hesitant to go out. Perhaps there is no safer place. Sooooo"
"Where is that Calmjohn? There have been two protests here, one in cars and one very small walking protest. No violence whatsoever during the protests."
"Protests in solidarity with those in the states occurred for one in Guadalajara (same state as PV, Jalisco), also another protest for same as in PV over president in cars, 5000 of them, and another violent one over a man who was arrested for not wearing a mask near Lakeside (Ixtlahuacan de Membrillos) and things went bad and the man died. Violent protests in Guadalajara over that. I wish to also point out that the culture of Mexico ( Nationals) and the attitude of many ex pats in Mexico is not to follow the rules for various reasons. So even getting compliance with mask use is becoming a big issue across the country. Just a little insight into the state of Jalisco, some areas very close to PV. There should be an update before June 15th on what Jalisco's next step will be. Protests for ""Black lives Matter"" and Mr Floyd have happened around the world not just in the USA."
"The protests in the US certainly don't make me or members of our family feel ""unsafe."" We live near Portland, Oregon, which is currently one of the major protest cities. The news shows looting and violence at times related to Portland protests and the others in the US. However, the tone of most of the protests is peaceful and constructive. There is nothing that directly threatens our physical safety. Also, Bezerk's point about these protests being worldwide is right on."
Peaceful protests are fine but the lack of masks on many protestors is what I find unnerving.
"I guess if your old and/or have preexisting conditions you might now want to travel now. If your healthy and young, I see no need to cancel plans now. I wouldn’t travel to a hot zone like Mexico right now but I have no reservations traveling in the states via airplane or car."
