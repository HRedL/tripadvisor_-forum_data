""" Portugal seems to be the only country requiring tests now even to their own citizens/residents. ""I know Dubai is for both people entering & leaving. No idea what other countries also require testing, but wouldn't be surprised if there are more"
">>> I know Dubai is for both people entering & leaving <<<======Its the whole of the UAE, not just Dubai and it applies to airside transfers too."
"""Its the whole of the UAE, not just Dubai and it applies to airside transfers too.""You need to have a negative Covid-19 test to enter the UAE, if you are 12 or older. The test cannot be older than 96 hours from an designated center and 72 hours from any other approved center.When leaving the country, it depends where you are flying to. This is valid for Europe incl. the UK, but also fro some other countries:https:/â€¦"
Cyprus is another country which requires a negative test as part of entry requirements for foreign nationals.
Most Caribbean countries also require a test.....not sure why is Louis surprised.
"France just altered requirements again yesterday and also require a 'test' for certain arrivals. That does not include EU or UK, USA may still not enter for tourism, blah blah, but certain arrivals that were allowed without a test, now require one.It's a mess, changing by the hour on a whim without any obvious structure. Everywhere."
"yes, so the best advice for now is to stay at home"
"Heh heh heh . . . but I'm booked, to France, depart in 5 weeks, and I'm Scottish.I'm also pi$$ed of with being 'compliant' whilst admiring press reviews of Bournemouth beach, so I'm probably safer in France. The issue is Gov whims and fag packet strategies altered at an hours notice by email, I spent last night mulling 'B' plans - plural !!"
"How are you getting to France, driving?What seriously p'ssed me off was an article on BBC website, in order to open schools, we should close the pubsEdited: 5:48 am, August 02, 2020 "
"Yeah, that pub story was a beauty. Flying EZY EDI-NCE rtn 6th Sept for 30 days, it's the 30 days & return that concern me. The Riviera is always mobbed in August so I banked on it being open, and it is, however that in turn means a massive influx of all nationalities for the 30 days preceding mine.A sure fire recipe for a mahooosive 2nd wave if ever there was one, so I need a plan B for overland home incase there is a 'shutdown' -- Or stay home and shift my flights to next year"
"Hard to say what is for the best, we are planning a trip abroad but not earlier than November..and that probably won't happen either.As for your Plan B, easy though long, you can get back by train......."
">>> What seriously p'ssed me off was an article on BBC website, in order to open schools, we should close the pubs <<<=====That is clearly kite flying, That said I note the Governments approval rating has absolutely crashed, I wonder why?"
And they fritter money right left and centre...expect us taxpayers to pay for it
"That said I note the Governments approval rating has absolutely crashed, I wonder why? ""Because it seems like majority of people are fed up & just want to get back to a normal life, have given up on taking many precautions & sod the consequences, no matter whatNot good for the nest of us who want to stay safe trough"
">>> Because it seems like majority of people are fed up & just want to get back to a normal life, have given up on taking many precautions & sod the consequences, no matter whatNot good for the nest of us who want to stay safe trough <<<=======It was a rhetorical tongue in cheek question, I'm well aware of the reasons why. When the full truth about what did or more like didn't happen in care home and social services are fully understood/revealed they well may reach the point the point of no return.Edited: 7:08 am, August 02, 2020 "
"Because it seems like majority of people are fed up & just want to get back to a normal life, have given up on taking many precautions & sod the consequences, no matter what - I aqree there are those who just ignore the rules but there have always been those from day 1.In my opinion one of the major problems is the rules are no longer clear and simple - in the beginning it was a clear stay home message but now we can go out with masks and social distancing in certain situations but who can honestly say they know how many people they can meet up with in their homes, gardens or public spaces with differing rules for different parts of the UK."
"Folk respond to clear, consistent and concise messaging, this government has given a masterclass in the opposite.Throw into the mix they don't have the bandwith to deal with the issues you have the perfect storm."
You can't expect people to duck and cover forever. It's amazing people have been this good so long.Of course they could start making examples of people. Maybe public floggings? When that no longer is enough step things up
"Good idea about public flogging, but without crowds? You need people to see:)"
">>> It's amazing people have been this good so long. <<<========Quite.I thought the lock down would start to break down in a meaningful way 8/9 weeks in, but its generally held until now. However, there is limit and that limit is fast approaching.Edited: 9:01 am, August 02, 2020 "
"I vote we start with Westminster, that 'crowd' got to be top of any list.And re #11. the train. Yip, I was in way deeper than that with a whole flow chart of 'what ifs' so I could cross the EU to anywhere the UK were letting in, split Scotland & England in case the rules were different. Could even get to Tunisia from NCE and then LGW, or any EU state still open to either Sco or Eng.Or I could use the loaf and stay home !! just seems like capitulation."
