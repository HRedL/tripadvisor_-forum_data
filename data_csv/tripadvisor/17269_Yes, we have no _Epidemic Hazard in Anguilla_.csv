"The RSOE EDIS Emergency and Disaster Information Service, which reports worldwide disasters, has just reported to the whole world that some 300 of the 1800 passengers aboard the cruise ship Celebrity Mercury out of Charleston are suffering from stomach upset, vomiting and diarrhea. Unfortunately, their announcement starts, ""Epidemic Hazard in Anguilla.""This ship is presently between here and St. Kitts. It has not been here, none of the passengers have been here and there is no ""epidemic hazard in Anguilla.Islander"
The island of Bonaire was notified one ship had Novovirus and a pamphlet was sent to all tour ops and taxis how to manage vomiting passengers. It was ludicrous. Cruise ships are breeding grounds for these virus. YUCK
