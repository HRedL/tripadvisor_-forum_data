Is the Anacostia Metro area safe? I know on one forum Branch Avenue was said to be sorta touch-and-go. I realize that Anacostia is 4 lines up on the green. How about Congress Heights and Navy Yard? Thanks again :)
It may not be safe for out-of-towners. A while ago I recall hearing about an epidemic of bus drivers getting hurt by people throwing deliberately-aimed rocks through their windshields at that station.
"I wouldn't consider any of the areas you mention to be safe, especially for tourists. As a general rule, you don't want to consider staying at any hotels in DC with an address in Northeast or Southeast.Are you asking this question because of hotels, or for some other reason? If you're looking for a hotel, tell us what you're considering and we can help. If there's some other reason, we can probably help you with that too!"
"Thank you for your help. After I posted my ?, I did find info on the forum about Anacostia---sounds very scary to me! I think I will stick with Bethesda. Thanks again!"
"I would not go to that area, especially after dark."
"Yes, you are better off staying in Bethesda!"
It is definitely not safe.
I agree with the other posters.Bethesda is a much better choice. You will like that area much better.
As a former Police Officer in Southeast DC I highly recommend not stopping at the Anacostia or Congress Heights stops. These were both dangerous areas and I responded to many calls at both Metro Stations. As far as the Navy Yard stop you will be fine but it's across the Anacostia River away from the 2 other stops. Where are you trying to actually get to?
"Hello flattop, thanks for your response! Actually, we are considering whether or not we want to stay at the Navy Lodge in Bethesda or the Navy Lodge in D.C. which has the address of :Bellvue Housing Community on Magazine Road, turn left onto Beyer Road to the Naval Lodge. There is a Metro Station outside the gates of the Lodge.I know that Bethesda is a good location, but it takes awhile to reach downtown D.C. I'm not quite sure which Metro Stop that is being referred to for the D.C. stop. If it closer, and safe, we will probably go for this one. Thank you! :)"
"""Is the Anacostia Metro area safe""No.....Oh God no....Navy Yard? Don't go at night.Branch Avenue? Don't go there at all/Congress Heights? Don't even think of going there."
