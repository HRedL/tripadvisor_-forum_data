"does anybody have any information on the virus going around this hotel,due to travel 22 nd june thinking of cancelling holiday,it seems to be going on for some time now with rui doing nothing about it,"
2 people have had a iffy tummy and your going to be thinking of cancelling ?
"look at tripadvisor reviews,every other one ,complains about a virus at hotel,keep looking to see if reviews get better and another one complains...."
"Similar reviews used to appear all the time for the Marconfort Beach Club until their management said they'd start suing the fraudulent claimants who were being encouraged by dodgy British claims companies. Remarkably other nationalities stayed 'virus' free.Norovirus is a notifiable disease here, there aren't any current notifications."
"it does seem,some reviews are really good others complain of stomach bug,anyhow we will be travelling to this hotel,we have never had a bad holiday with rui before,lets hope it clears up.thanks for the reply"
"Ah ,,,the dodgy British claims .!!...the new whip lash scam , it was even on TV in NL"
"perhaps it is best to treat the so called claims as a joke but unless the people making these claims can produce medical evidence that they have suffered as a result of the actions of the hotel they may find themselves being sued. As has been said it seems that by some miracle only the British in touch with an insurance claims person suffer ill effects, everyone else is perfectly fine.Every time I walk past the Riu everyone looks very happy and if the timing is right heading for the dining room."
"I dont tend to take notice of such things, but did see a FB ad asking if a holiday had been ""spoiled"" by upset stomach etc to get in touch etc. Seems its the ""new"" PPI."
"I was in there on Sunday afternoon and it certainly all looks very swish. Spotlessly clean too, and everyone seemed to be really enjoying themselves. I didn't see any medics or ambulances, although perhaps the sicknotes were confined to their rooms (or drinking far too much then blaming the inevitable results on a 'virus')."
"All its seems they need to do is buy some stuff at the Farmacia , keep the receipt , and the scammers do all the paper work . One hotel has now gone up from 50 to 500 claims in a year , and are thinking about not taking any more British Tour Operators .itv.com/news/â€¦"
Yes they filmed someone who said he was confined to his sickbed jumping in the pool and he posted on his facebook page about all the places he had been ( Intelligent !!) Not at a Rui Hotel I might add Hope you have a good holiday
"I'm thinking of cancelling too. If you take of the 'English only' icon on trip advisor other nationalities are also affected. I learned from past experience that not all claims are dodgy, after my 2 year old son was hospitalised with cryptosporidium a few years ago. I keep requesting that someone give us the results of any tests they have had. As yet no one has responded to me. I have contacted tacked my local notifiable disease offices and in our authority (east of England) there has been no one with a notifiable disease at the hotel .. however that does not mean that there has not been anywhere else. My concern is not s 24 hour D&V it is if the illness is caused by something more serious like a bacteria or parasite. I just do not know what to think at the moment"
"This is starting to have an impact now on all of us. I tried to book a hotel we stayed Ai at 3 months ago, for June. That option was available on the site but when you clicked on it nothing happened, still showed Hb, hotel obviously not selling Ai to UK guests (was through a UK travel agent). Read online about someone else having the some problem with booking another hotel & we had previously stayed there Ai. This wasn't on the Cds, but if they're starting there con here, it soon will be. I've booked for Torre instead, arrive in 4 weeks, can't wait."
"I think as long as everyone uses safe hygiene and wash their hands everyone should be OK. I'm staying there on the 23rd June a group of 8 and cant wait to go.The hotel looks amazing !! Shame on all those cheating scamming gits trying make the British holiday makers look like tools, its no wonder the Spanish dont like the Brits. we go abroad to get away from idiots and they still show us up."
We had a call inviting us to purger our selves. Absolutely ****ing disgraceful
Well I don't know what to believe!! We are due here next week and were looking forward to a weeks break in the sun but not looking forward to getting the dreaded lurgy which a lot of people are reporting!Hope to God we escape as some of the reports are horrendous.Will be reporting myself when we get back. Watch this space!!
"You have a thread with 15 replies and nobody is reporting anything wrong about the hotel so what do you mean by 'a lot of people are reporting'.Wild, unsubstantiated rumours, but not even them because we keep a watch on things Torremolinos. What motivates comments like the ones you are making when the only evidence we have is that a lot of Brits are lying to get insurance claims. Or were because now the Spanish tourist industry won't wear it any more."
"This is the era of post-truth, Manzana. Just look to what is happening across the pond. Facts sadly don't matter any more."
"You only have to look at what is going on with the tickets for the Ariana Grande concert on Sunday to see how low many people will go. These people have no shame whatsoever, and really don't care that they're wrecking other people's holidays and adding to the cost of the holiday insurance for all."
My mum has just spent 5 days in hospital! Loads of people have had it or got it! It is not a scam to get compensation believe me!!!
We were diagnosed with Cryptosperidium years ago (1997) after arriving home from Fuengirola.I think caught from pool water.Just grateful to get home and be well again.In those days you just accepted that these things happened --- you didn't think about 'making a claim'Any genuine person or child being poorly has my sympathy.
Thanks jumartt I would just like to say to manzana I am not scaremongering! I think looking at the reports I have reason to be worried to those who think everyone on here is making it up for a claim. I am diabetic and could possibly end up in hospital so please don't belittle people who have put genuine reports of d & v on here!
hi its such a shame if this is true about this hotel for the last 7 years we have gone to what was the rui belplaya and had fantastic times and food was brilliant along with staff.also stayed in the largo with my family.hopefully it all ends well and back to the brilliant hotel it was.
"My dis and mum say there is nothing wrong with the food st all! They are now being looked after! It is a bug that is in the hotel probably passed on by poor hygiene of othe guests. However, if this were a school it would be closed and deep cleaned! Will it take someone to die before they admit there's a problem and do something about it!! Thank God my mum survived and will be returning home the next old and vulnerable person may not be so lucky!!!"
I have been in touch with Thomson and they say they do know about it and are trying to rectify the situation but unless they get to the bottom of it it will keep spreading. Apparantly its an air borne virus but then in the next breathe they are saying holiday makers need to wash their hands etc!!!

No soy guri why were you at the hotel ? It's a non cash hotel? So you couldn't have popped in for a drink or something to eat as it's all inclusive only. Do you work at the hotel? You just seem to defend it all the time and question the motives of anyone who mentions the bug.
"I went in to meet some friends who were staying there and to have a look around now the refurb has been finished, not that that's really any of your business.I'm not 'defending it all the time' but I'm perfectly prepared to stand up to the fraudulent insurance claims companies and the people who lie for cash without a thought for other holidaymakers, employees and businesses. It's perfectly easy to demonstrate if you have really been sick or not, as claimants will find out when the company starts counter-claims against them (as other companies are already doing)."
"As I said, a while ago a claims company rang me up and asked if I had been on on ai holiday. Why I said. They said because I can claim for being sick. But I wasn't sick I said. That don't matter they said we can claim anyway. I said rearrange these words into a well know phrase or saying...... Off **ck. And hung up."

"I haven't rubbished anybody on here who's said they've been ill. I've pointed out to would-be visitors that there are a lot of fraudulent claims and that these are being systematically encouraged. These claims include writing false reviews etc., not as information for potential visitors but to pressurise the hotels (it's not only this one). People (unsurprisingly) then become alarmed and think about cancelling.Of course some people can be genuinely ill, whether this is the responsibility of the hotel or not is an entirely different matter. Flights are a major cause of bugs spreading, this isn't the responsibility of the airlines. A lot of visitors can find they get upset stomachs in the first few days due to the change in the water (the water here has a very high mineral content).Anybody who is ill (and certainly those at risk such as the elderly) should call a doctor immediately. They are excellent here and your EHIC and travel insurance will cover any costs. If subsequently the person then feels they have a case for compensation then they have proper evidence.Thomsons will say 'they know about a bug' simply to cover themselves. All the agents do it.Edited: 3 years ago "
Don't really think that having health insurance really makes up for being ill does it! It is the responsibility of both hotel and holiday company to advise guests to stay in their room until they are better and not contaminate others!!! Some people are very selfish!!
Is there a bug around torremolinos itself though as that's what Thomson is telling guests .?Honestly there is a bug this was my third visit to Spain this year. We love Spain we are always abroad have just got back from Cyprus and this wasn't just a case of over indulgence or a bit of a sore throat from a flight. We are youngish (late 30s) and healthy. No Soy guri have you not heard of anyone having the bug in the last few months? What about your friends that are staying at the hotel ?
Lots if people have it at the hotel now! Thankfully my family are leaving today!!
We got back last night. I spent all Saturday night being violently sick. I have never felt so I'll. I'd not overindulged in anything. I'd taken dettol wipes and hand gel and used the hand gel provided at every opportunity so for all those sceptics on here it is still an ongoing problem for this place.I'd been in touch before we went and was told by Thomson that there certainly was an issue and suggested it might be airborne.Luckily I was the only one poorly out of party of four but alot of others were the same as me and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy!!!!
"Just got back from said hotel, travelled on June 1st for 2 weeks.Hotel is spotless, however, there is a big there I caught it & was violently ill for 10 hours.There have been many people on Trip Advisor making comments about it.Basically, it is a lottery, I was really careful, used hand gel, used disinfectant wipes, took my only beaker & straw to drink out of in the day, but was still ill.If you are like myself and dreaded the thought of the bug (and also travelled with a vulnerable person), then I would say this is not the hotel for you, on the other hand, if you are one of these people that tend not to worry and wouldn't think it was so bad if you caught it, then go ahead and book.Basically, in a nutshell that is it.I have had several run ins with people that thought I was being over pathetic and should have just got on with it, however I personally didn't feel that way, I still can't understand why the bug is still there after nearly 3 moths.At the end of the day, you just have to decide what type of person you are."

"Claims in the UK have rocketed. i think the figure was from 7 to 447 in a year. These false claims affect those who are genuine because the assumption is that all are false. A good way to back up your false claim would be using TA forums so on this we have phrases like 'lots of guests' with nothing specific. I am not saying that the claims made here are false just that everyone will now assume they are.Looking back on my own holiday history I suppose I must have had about 4 bad stomachs in (I'm guessing) 200 holidays so about 2%. If we look at the big AI hotels they have 1000 plus guests so I'd expect about 10 to 15 bad stomachs at any one time , cause unknown but I have been on a cruise ship where sanitisers are everywhere and everyone had been warned about sanitising hands and regularly half the men leave the loo without washing their hands and even walk straight into the dining buffet waving the sanitiser gel away. It doesn't have to be you that gives yourself a dodgy stomach. It is clear that either the British have weak stomachs or we are a dishonest lot as no other nationality seems to suffer like we do!!"
Same happens in women's loos manzana. It doesn't surprise me there are so many bad stomachs around :(
"First of all, I would like to say I have spent 3 previous holidays in the Riu Bellplaya hotel (this was one of the two hotels that were renovated into Riu Costa Del Sol) and if anyone would care to check my reviews, there is no mention of a bug!!I would like to confirm to all the know alls on this forum, that actually, this virus DOES exist.I know because I was violently ill non stop for 10 hours !!Just for the record, NO, I have no intention of claiming compensation!!!I was in my hotel room for 48 hours!!This bug has been going around this hotel since it opened on March 31st.I met 6 people while I was there from June 1st-14th, who also caught the bug.I also did try for weeks before to change the holiday, (due to travelling with a vulnerable person, on heart medication), unfortunately, Thomson or even ABTA wanted to know.I also received written confirmation from Riu & Thomson, that there IS indeed a bug.I appreciate that there will be people out there, that will try & claim when they haven't even caught the bug, by the same token, there are genuine people out there, that HAVE caught it!!!So, in answer to your question, yes, there is a bug, some people will catch it and probably even more, won't catch it.You can take precautions like using hand gel & disinfectant, however, it didn't work for me.If you are not too bothered by the bug, fine, go ahead & travel, if you are travelling with vulnerable people, I would see if you could change it."
"Wrong, I know, I caught it!!!!!No I am not claiming compensation either!!!!"
"Sorry Nita, I wasn't referring to you, I was just generalising."
Caught the bug in April......... no claim made.
"Not everyone who has had the bug (yes there really is one, i caught it and no i am not claiming) !!!I caught it after day 7.I used handhel, disinfectant wipes, took my own straws and"

> It appears widespread throughout Torremolinos < where did you hear that ??Now its growing arms and legs
I haven't looked recently but I thought I'd read it on other trip advisor revues like the Marcontoft
"I think to say that > It appears widespread throughout Torremolinos < is a bit over reactionary ,hearsay multiplies into epidemic proportions in a few ill chosen words ."
"My apologies then, but I think I may have read it elsewhere too. Maybe one of the places I had read it was this one, must look at the other Riu revues see what they say."
"If they're not AI there won't be sickness, because then the fraudsters can't 'prove' it came from the hotel. Alternatively you can change your passport for a non-UK one, this seems to protect people too.There isn't any epidemic of sickness in Torremolinos. The hotels should just ban all Brits."

just checked British is not the only nationality claiming sickness while staying at this hotel even the Spanish are claiming it.
"I haven't called everybody liars at all, all I've done is pointed out that there are substantial numbers of false claims and as a result of that people should take the preponderance of reviews mentioning sickness with a pinch of salt (or perhaps Dioralyte). I don't work in the hospitality industry either. At last the holiday companies are fighting back:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g187â€¦"
Not convinced about the guidelines for posting had mine removed. For asking someone if they work in the hospitality trade but ban all the British is allowed???? Racist comments should be removed.
"I think that NSG's comment about ""ban all British"" was tongue in cheek because there are countries and hotels that have already said they are going to bar British tourists from AI hotels because of the number of false claims for illness. People need to be less judgemental about some posts, too many get removed because people disagree with the comments in general even if they have good information in them.My whole thread on the Thomas Cook court case has been removed as ""inappropriate"" and I have requested it to be reinstated via the help centre, which is what you can do for your removed post if you wanted to. If they don't reinstate mine, that's no problem because others have posted it about it on other threads too.Edited: 3 years ago "
its not the point I personally took offence to this comment. Spain does very well from the British tourist industry.
"Its typical ...the OP has never returned to reply, one way or the other and at least ,asked the question before travelling , not like many posters on the car hire pages ,turn up after the event ranting on about being ripped off.Keyboard warriors , and un polite people, will not get any help on the pages by the majority of people who take time to try and reply to questions asked .Jefoh ,I did not read your post so I cant say one way or the other , some of the others that were removed were ...lets say ,better off in the bin ."

"Well exactly John! One of the defining characteristics of we Britons used to be the ability to laugh at ourselves. It's so annoying when people remove posts as it makes threads difficult to follow. This whole situation may easily have quite dramatic consequences for British people booking holidays next year (if Spain bans Brits from AI you can bet most other countries will too). This situation arises from the 'no win, no fee' claims system that operates in most of the UK, the only way the holiday companies will be able to fight false claims is by counter-suing - they are now starting to do this. If people are going to come into threads simply to take offence it's going to make discussions of almost anything quite impossible, on at least four posts now I've made it quite clear that no individual in this thread is being referred to.Edited: 3 years ago "
John silly comments are not helping anyone. I genuinly was trying to help people on trip advisor. I honestly was ill...... is everyone being honest how do I know? But I believe unless you have stayed at the hotel you shouldn't be commenting on whether the sickness is real or not. Destination experts your help is always very much appreciated however you can't honestly answer this question were as I thought I could having recently stayed at the hotel.Maybe you could start your own thread about holiday scams in Spain. And just to finish I have not made a claim.
As an after thought...... I personally think it would be better for everyone if there were no all inclusive hotels.
Amen to that! AI hotels take business from local bars and restaurants and although they do employ local people there would be more money going into the local economy if they didn't exist.Oh and I did start a thread on the Thomas Cook court case and there were several responses but it was reported as being against guidelines so has been removed!Edited: 3 years ago 
"I can see for and against arguments for AI, it's a lot to do with budgeting, especially for families with young children. I know I'm an OF, but it does mean we don't have to take cash with us."

"Is there still a problem, or has it resolved itself."
"There never was an issue only people fanning flames for likely claims.Like the runners attending the world championship in London and getting food poisioning who stayed at the Tower Hotel, it does not have to be the fault of the hotel that you get food poisioning.Fortunatley Spanish hotels are monitoring clients and fighting back against unjust claims, seeking and winning costs for false claims."
There truly are some A holes out there who ruin it for the rest of us. I'm looking forward to going to this hotel at the end of September. I hope it's as good as the Riu I went to at Belek in Turkey.
These remarks really infuriate me as I was very poorly whilst there in June like some others . I have never been so sick in all my life luckily I didn't have it at the other end like some. I certainly didn't go looking for compensation so please don't dismiss this as rubbish and that only scammers complain and make it up just to get money back!!!
"Dear MadmolNobody is suggesting that you are making up your illness but there are thousands of ways in which people can get that sort of illness. Only this weekend there was a scientific paper suggesting that the circulation of air on airplanes when there is a slightly leaky engine seal can produce severe symptoms of the sort described here. many other ways of acquiring these symptoms are described in the 85 posts so far.What is annoying for anyone is the way that unscrupulous people have invented illnesses or used an illness acquired some other way to blame the hotel in the hope of getting compensation. We all, I am sure, hope you are now well.. but none of us have seen any evidence that the RIU was to blame for your illness or anyone else's."
"madmol,imo and I've been affected twice ,not at the Rui , if you're not as you called it ""going at the other end"" then you havn't been as ill as you think you have.It's not unusual for a hotel to ask if you need a doctor calling ,that is if there isn't one visiting it and if you have insurance this is the way to go . You get the diagnosis in his opinion and including an injection for the vomiting advice you need to take , which is to isolate yourself in your room for several days ....and believe me you wouldn't want to leave your bed ...anyway . We we're not on a package holiday and no thought of claiming was in our minds .We took it as being the Norovirus not anything we'd eaten.Edited: 3 years ago "
