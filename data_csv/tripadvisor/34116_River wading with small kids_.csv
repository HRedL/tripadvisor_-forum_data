Can you suggest a place near the town of Sonoma where we can take toddlers to wade in a river? Thanks.
The Russian River area (Westside Road) to the north and there is also a road to the south h as numerous places where you can wade in the river.https:/â€¦guide-russian-river-resort-area
Thanks! That helps.
SARS-CoV-2 has found to be viable in the water. Keep our rivers clean please. Stay out.Thank you
"Sonoma Creek runs through Sonoma. I found this park that edges the creek, Maxwell Farms Regional Park. I would ask a local for details if the creek has water in it at this point."
"As a local I can assure you there is no good place near the TOWN of Sonoma to wade in a river or creek. The Russian River that Mimi mentions is a good hour's drive to the north. Sonoma Creek, which does flow thru the Valley and the Town, is a small creek. In the summer there's not much water in it and it runs at the bottom of a steep creek bed. The slopes are covered with loose soil and rocks and poison oak. No sandy beaches.The town does have a very nice central Plaza with a playground (?? if it's open these days), and a small duck pond (but no wading)."
