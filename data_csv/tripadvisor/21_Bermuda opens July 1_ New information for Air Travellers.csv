"We look forward to welcoming visitors to Bermuda starting July 1, 2020. Over the past few months, we’ve been dedicated to protecting our community and pristine destination for our residents and guests to enjoy for years to come. See the link attached for Bermuda Government protocols that visitors must comply with prior to and during their visit to the island.gotobermuda.com/bta/press-release/bermuda-to…Edited: 8:07 am, June 26, 2020 "
"To Bermuda Tourism;Please tell me where a person could obtain health insurance to include COVID-19 coverage?I'm sorry, but there is no company in the world offering this type of coverage.Tourists being tested 3 times, after receiving a negatve test at the airport, please, this does not make any sense.Having to log your temperature twice daily, come on, in a very hot climate, it is likely, most visitors will likely have an elevated body temperature.Does Bermuda really want tourists, under these conditions, none will be willing to submit to these intrusions. Why not just have a travel ban for all visitors coming from the US, where the virus is totally out of control.In Canada, we have it under control."
"Not making it easy for potential visitors to pull the trigger and go to Bermuda. It appears that some of Bermuda's competition destinations are opening up with far less restrictions and at a much more reasonable cost. I most certainly do not find fault with Bermuda protecting it's people as it is such a small place. I would probably remain closed down for visitors until perhaps the fall or until the US gets it under control , when ever that might be. I have met many very nice people from Canada and am glad to hear you are doing well and have things under control but I am not sure enough people from there go to Bermuda to even help a little bit of the hardship Bermuda is now seeing to it's economy. It really needs the travelers from the US and from people I speak with no one is even thinking about a Bermuda vacation until the summer of 2021 at the earliest."
"We had a vacation booked to go to Bermuda for the first week in June of 2020. Airline cancelled the flight in April. At that time, we moved the hotel reservation to the first week of September of 2020. Have not yet purchased airline tickets and very likely won't be purchasing them or going on this trip in 2020. Back in April my thinking was that things may improve to the extent that we would be comfortable boarding a plane and visiting Bermuda. No longer feel that way with how things are going in the US. Sometime this coming month I plan to call the hotel and move the reservation to June of 2021. We will see if things are better by then.For what it is worth, hotel recently updated their status and they are not taking any reservations for stays that begin before August 1, 2020. I suspect this date could get pushed out again."
"mgiannetto - Just wondering, if you don't mind sharing, what hotel you have reservations with? I'm in much the same situation. I currently have reservations at the Hamilton Princess for the first week of October 2020. While my flight hasn't been cancelled ""yet"", I see that as a distinct possibility. Also, not sure how comfortable I am travelling anytime this year. On the Hamilton Princess website, they say they will ""review the reopening on August 1st"" which I take to mean not that they will open on August 1st - just review WHEN they might re-open. I suspect a decision to re-open would be based on the interest level of people willing to make the trip and their willingness to follow all the many protocols that Bermuda is instituting for visitors to try and keep all safe."
"Sorry, Bermuda...not interested under these conditions. Maybe next year..."
I don't think going on vacation will be high on anyone's priority list during or soon after a global pandemic. It's apparent that Bermuda is foreseeing a drastic decline in tourism for the foreseeable future:https://tinyurl.com/ybwv8zee
">>>...Sorry, Bermuda...not interested under these conditions. Maybe next year...<<<I'm afraid that that's a sentiment that Bermuda Tourism is going to be hearing from a great many these days...and for at least many months to come. So far Bermuda has done an excellent job of containing the effects of Covid-19 domestically. Much of this has been the result of her relative geographic isolation and some from the closing off of normal means of transport--air and sea...along with her own internal preventive measures. But once tourists begin to return...even with internal preventative measures....there's no tellin' what will happen.""..We have met the enemy and he is us.."""
If only so called ‘bigger ‘ nations had imposed similar measures we would all be much further ahead
"K12033 said, ""Just wondering, if you don't mind sharing, what hotel you have reservations with? Sure, it's the Fairmont Southampton.Incidentally, just happened to check google flights this morning and noticed that the flight I was watching for this potential trip (JFK to BDA non-stop on Delta) no longer exists. Non-stop on JetBlue still shows ""for now"".I plan to call the Fairmont this coming week and discuss rates for June of 2021. Sadly, the Sept 2020 trip gets more unlikely by the day."
"... when this storm passes, and it will, I’m wondering how secure it is to visit areas that have successfully suppressed this virus from building some degree of community immunization? Without that we can only hope for vaccines or effective therapies ... even then there will always be risks as we know from the common strains of flu which continue to kill thousands despite effective vaccines ... welcome to life!Edited: 8:39 am, June 28, 2020 "
... a petition was raised and presented to the Prime Minister to prohibit US flights ... “Welcome to the new Bermuda” ?????
"Agreed, great idea! Maybe then Canadians could enjoy the island, and the protocals wouldn't need to be so strict."
">>>..I’m wondering how secure it is to visit areas that have successfully suppressed this virus from building some degree of community immunization?...<<<Sorry...but to the best of my knowledge (???) there is no evidence of any ""...community immunization.."" factor with Covid-19.If Bermuda has managed to avoid the worst of this pandemic, it has been more a factor of enforced '..quarantine..' due to the absence of contact created by the ban on air and sea transportation...and controlling the local spread/infection via effective local public health measures. Bermuda's relatively isolated geographic location and relatively small (albeit dense) resident population has worked in her favor.And....evidently NOT all of Bermuda is anxious to roll back these protections prematurely--""..Petition calls for further delay to US flights..""--(Royal Gazette--June 29, 2020)royalgazette.com/news/article/20200629/petit…""...Premier Responds To Petition About U​.​S Flights...<<<--(Bernews--June 29, 2020)https:/… Given the way that the US has handled Covid-19....who can blame 'em ??"
"There likely will not be any Canadian tourists going to Bermuda, or any international destinations, for the forseeable future.The CBC in Canada has just learned that the Quarantine Act will be extended indefinitely, which means when you return to Canada, you must self-isolate for 14 days, subject to RCMP checks.Don't think any travel or medical insurance will be valid.I would be interested to see if the Air Canada flight has any passengers on it July 12th.Edited: 9:22 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"Well, it's not only Canadian tourists who fly back and forth with Air Canada. Many Bermudians go to university here and many Bermudians have family here. I don't know what is going to happen with the universities in the Fall. A sizeable number of Canadians also work in Bermuda, I don't know what their situation is going to be like."
"“If at any time their test result is positive they will be fitted with a quarantine bracelet and will be required to isolate in their room. The bracelets will alert the authorities if the person attempts to leave their room.“All visitors will be required to complete an electronic pre-boarding form before they can board a plane to Bermuda. They cannot have a positive test result and must not be sick or have COVID-19 symptoms. The visitor must demonstrate they have health/medical insurance to cover all medical “If a visitor becomes ill while in Bermuda, they will be required to isolate for a minimum of 14 days at their own expense or until they can leave the island by private jet or yacht.“Additionally visitors will be told of the requirement to wear a mask, how to establish physical distancing and the requirement to frequently wash their hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.”The Premier concluded, “As we move forward, we will continually examine our protocols and adjust them, as needed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have proven to be nimble in our response. All agencies involved have shared information and worked together closely. This will continue. We will do all in our power to make sure people in Bermuda remain safe.“If breaches are observed, members of the public can dial 211 to file a report with the Bermuda Police Service who will investigate immediately. We have developed a good record and strong reputation for our handling of the crisis. This will continue.”-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The paragraphs above were found in post #13's reference to ""The Premier's remarks......."". Some of these sentences are especially interesting. We had made our reservations way back in January. As our September trip draws closer we realize that traveling at this time is probably not for us due to extended time for the mask wearing, testing as well as Delta recently changing our flights from BOS to BDA direct and now both through ATL . Hopefully we will be there next May,"
">>>...The paragraphs above were found in post #13's reference to ""The Premier's remarks......."". Some of these sentences are especially interesting....<<<Okay. That's grand. Now compare these statements by Premier David Burt's to the BERMUDA TRAVEL AUTHORISATION requirements published by the Bermuda government--https:/…bermuda-travel-authorisationThere's no mention of a health insurance requirement...nor is there mention of quarantine bracelets or many other nor-so-minor details."
Ok you got me. Who’s correct the Premier or HIS government? Utterly confusing.
">>>...Utterly confusing...<<<I listened in on the Bermuda Tourism Authority's '..webinar..' (just what the world needs...another clever buzz word) on Monday. As you might expect, he effects of Covid-19 on this year's tourism statistics and their affect on the domestic economy were grim...and it's clear that no matter how Bermuda is reopened, the 2020 '..season..' is toast...and the 2021 'season' ain't lookin' good either.From my perspective as a tourist, albeit a loyal, multi-generational, muulti-repeat visitor, I was more than a bit disappointed in Bermuda Tourism's and government's plans....which was strong on '..buzz words..' '...jetsetters..', '..adventure seekers..', et al )....but short on details of a real recovery plan. It would appear that even in light of the current disaster, they simply intend on reverting to the old National Tourism Plan, which had been of questionable benefit or demonstrable effectiveness. This even though for at least the foreseeable future, recreational travel worldwide will be in turmoil. Their research consultants had created colorful graphs and charts and come up more '..metrics..'...which may or may not be proved or disproved (in the very best traditions of of '..consultancy..').I couldn't help but wonder how the new, semi-autonomous BERMUDA TOURISM AUTHORITY is any better (though in fairness, no worse) than the old government ministry directed system ?? The rationale for the new system was to create an agency that was more responsive and effective. In practice, it would appear that the '..new..' system has shifted some deck chairs around, redecorated the lounge, added new faces and adopted a lot of new buzz words to their lexicon...but is just as muddled and ineffective as the old. It used to be said (with more than a bit justification) of Bermuda tourism that, ""..When the US sneezes; Bermuda catches cold.."". Well, the entire world has '..sneezed..' and though Bermuda has managed to avoid the worst of the '..cold..'...she's gone into a '..coma..'."
... Bermuda’s visitor's protocol looks more fitting for a nursing home than it does a vacation destination ... maybe next year????
"There have been questions and more than some confusion regarding the issue of whether personal health insurance coverage is required for arriving visitors for expenses incurred because of COVID-19. Though it's difficult to find any information on this question, it seems that Covid-19 personal health insurance is not '..required..'""...A Traveler should:A visitor should acquire health insurance covering illness outside of home jurisdiction to cover all health costs including those related to a positive Covid-19 diagnosis while in Bermuda. If this is not obtained, a visitor will be responsible for all health and accommodations costs if treatment and/or quarantine is required; including costs related to a positive Covid-19 diagnosis while in Bermuda....""https://cloudfront.bernews.com/wp-content/up…It would appear that the various agencies (BTA, Ministry of Health, Ministry of of Tourism & Transport, et al.) in Bermuda that are responsible for providing Covid-19 information are putting out information and advice to visitors/tourists each in their own UN-COORDINATED way and time. Their does NOT appear to be ANY centralized source of information...giving the disturbingly distinct impression that the '..right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing..'....or that everyone within the Covid-19 response structure from the Premier-to-the-clerks are just '..makin' it up as they go along..'.In fairness to the Bermuda government, they ain't nearly as bad as the US...but that's nuthin' to take any pride in or comfort from.."
"To Canadians who landed today from Toronto:Can anyone chime in as to if they were able to get their COVID-19 test results within the 72 hour requirement?Insurance - Anyone get COVID-19 insurance coverage, if so, what company?I would like to hear from the visitors as to how their experience was, re: COVID-19 testing, temperature checks, etc."
"Why would anyone pay the prices that Bermuda charges (even for a drink) to have to quarantine in their room for a period of time? What kind of holiday is that? Thanks, but no thanks. They either want me as a tourist, or they don’t. I can totally accept a clear bill of health boarding the plane and a temperature check, and will wear a mask anywhere, but no thanks on a quarantine while on holiday. ....and an expensive one at that. Also, re. Banning the US flights...why put us all in one lump? There should be another way. I have not been out in large groups, I worked remote from home since March and even had groceries delivered. I do not have underlying health risks. Such a shame that I can not travel because others did not follow social distancing rules or stayed home when told too. I live in an area where numbers are not high either."
Have just read on another forum about World Nomads providing COVID 19 coverage while traveling. I have not checked if it covers Bermuda but for those of you planning a trip this might be worth checking out.
