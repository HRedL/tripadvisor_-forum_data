"Interesting article about Dengue fever in the Caribbean and Mexico, bottom line, take plenty of mosquito protection and use it. Copy and paste into your browser:…yahoo.com/s/…dengue_epidemic"
Thanks Ellen for this important article.This could become very serious!And I am going early in December! (DUH!)I will be sure to slather that Mosquito Milk liberally. 
"Pepper, we are going to Mexico next month so I will be sure to do the same.When we were in AXA in March, I was bitten repeatedly and came home with huge welts. Even though I used repellant, they managed to find the places I had missed - very painful.This time, I intend on being very proactive.Ellen"
"Ellen:I don't know what repellant you are using but I strongly suggest one with a higher % of Deet, like Mosquito Milk, which is not permitted to be purchased in the US. These are the ones that work best against this horror.Being a health oriented, non-chemicals nut, this decision was a very difficult one for me. But I weighed the chemical content vs. 3 people I know who were so adversely affected by Caribbean mosquitoes that one actually died. One other woman friend of mine now has the mentality of a 16 year old (she got hers in St. Martin). The other one was cured, thank goodness, after a crisis.These horror stories made my decision for me."
"Pepper, I know you don't like chemicals, so this won't work for you, but this time I am going to get Deep Woods Off - ""Sportsman's"", it is 95% Deet, and I plan on using it on every sq inch. That last time of being bit did it for me, that was TERRIBLE."
Lots of repellant items on this page - copy and paste into browser:Read a post on another board that swears by the mosquito soap!…amazon.com/caribbeanbeachboutique-20/…Ellen
"I am a real target for the mosquitos and no-see-ums. I always get bit before anyone else is bothered, and have come home with huge welts that last for weeks. Until I discovered this fabulour product made by Sawyer. It is a wonderful low deet, time released lotion that I have been using for several years when in Anguilla. Nothing else has the same long lasting effect for me. The deet content is under 20% and the way it is made it doesn't absorb very much into your skin, but also does not evaporate like the sprays. I'm not kidding - this stuff is fabulour! Sawyer Controlled Release. I either order it online or buy it at REI or similar sporting stores. HAH - I sound like an advertisment!But really, go to this website to read about it:sawyer.com/sawyer_products/…index.htm"
"Anniewoods:Are you saying that you tried Mosquito Milk with a larger % of DEET than allowed by the USDA and it didn't work well for you?That surprises me, if so.As much as I hate using it, I find it imperative and so far, it has worked very well for me.All I do is one roll only right up the back of my legs, the front of my legs and around my ankle and feet. This year I will add my arms (1 roll front and back).It is also mandatory to repeat it after you have been in the water.I also circle my ankles when going out to restaurants at night because I sometimes have to walk through brush to get to the restaurant door."
Pepper - Mosquitto milk does not do it for me. I still get bit.
"Pepper - REI sells a product that is called REI Jungle Juice which is 98.11% Deet and it is sold in the US. So, I am not sure that there is really a limit as to the amount of Deet that is legal in the US. repellant products.My bottle of mosquitto milk from Anguilla says 24% Deet"
I used jungle juice. Probably got cancer but had no bites! ; )
Thanks AnnieW:I am truly fascinated that I have always been told that the reason MM is not acceptable in the US was because of its 45% DEET content.I will look into this (lethal 95%) Jungle Juice. Ha!But maybe I don't need that much of a zap because so far I have been lucky with Mosquito Milk.
There's just something about Mosquito Milk that works for us -- don't have the same luck with Off or anything else. Maybe it's the roll-on application? 
I have heard about garlic repellants but I have never tried one. Anyone know if they work?
I think for my dog but ewwwww for me! 
"Pepper - If the MM works for you, why try anything stronger? Deet is scary. That is why I am so happy with the Sawyer stuff that I have found effective - only 20% Deet and it lasts for 10 hours. I think everyone is a little different in what works for them. The sprays are least effective because they evaporate off of the skin quickly."
"Has anyone tried ""Bugband""? It's an apparatus that you wear around your ankle or wrist thatemits a repellant. My wife and Itried it in Nevis after being devoured for a few days by mosquitos and biting flies and itseemed to put a stop to it."
"Annie:You are right.If it ain't broke, don't fix it!I'll stick with my roll-on MM"
Where can I buy MM if I live inthe USA?
"Many moons ago, when I lived in St. Lucia, I had a HORRIBLE bout of Dengue fever. Trust me, it's to be avoided at all cost!!! It was painful and debilitating. I've never had it again (THANK GOD!!) but Ellen, I think it's lovely that you give folks a heads up on how to avoid it.KUDOS!!!"
ramblin' man:You cannot purchase Mosquito Milk in the States. It is forbidden.(I was told because of its high DEET content but who knows?)You can purchase it at Anguilla Drug Store or its annex at Malliouhana -- also there are other places to get it on the island.But be sure to only get the roll-on not the spray.
"I am still reading about this. Recently, there was an article in USA Today and the Daily Herald. It is not under control yet, be viligant folks!thedailyherald.com/news/…dengue138.html"
Have there been any reports in AXA yet? I haven't heard of anything.
"Pepper, no, I haven’t heard anything about AXA, but with their proximity to St Martin and the cases there, there is no doubt in my mind that it can, and will, make its way to AXA very easily and quickly.. We have to be careful, and I want everyone to be aware. This scares me big time. We are heading to Mexico shortly, I have bought Sportsmen’s Off, 100% DEET. When we were in AXA last time, the pain from the bites was excruciating, I don’t want to go through that again!!"
Time to resurrect this post. I just read on Travel Talk on Line that there have been 6 cases of Dengue reported recently; and those are the REPORTED cases.Do not take chances folks.Ellen
"See cached version (8 Sept 08)of Centers for Disease Control page for AXA (current page not available as of about 12:30 PM EDT Saturday, 13 Sept)http://tinyurl.com/6h6zoq"
"A few years back, Denque was big in Aruba. Then it it Curacao. Last year I knew or knew of about 20 who had it. I suspect one of the mossies got on DAE, went to SXM and made it's way to AXA. Do use bug spray. My client had it in Aug. and it's not fun. "
"I'm bring this one back up as SXM has had their first death from Dengue.Use whatever works for you, but use it.Ellen"
They have started spraying for Dengue fever here in St Croix. Assume other islands are doing the same. Off is the perfume of choice here. Use it several times a day. THe mosquites and no-see-ums have been pretty bad lately but that should ease off in about a month. Good idea also to travel with Raid flying insect killer to spray the bedroom you'll be sleeping in at night if the resort doesn't provide it. For those fo you that Deet Products doesn't work for try lavander oil.
"Just bought that lavander oil yesterday Howard, I'll let you know if we have any luck with it. Of course we're packing heavy duty stuff just in case but have never had to use it yet."
Two more suggestions--If you are planning to sit out on a patio or balcony at your resort/villa between sunset and bedtime light a mosquito coil. Raid has a package of ten that includes two metal bases. Costs $1.50 here on St Croix and we use them every evening. Also if you do get bitten After Bite works pretty well. Main ingredient is ammonia so it would be cheaper just to bring a small bottle filled with ammonia and use it straight. Seems to work prety well for us. Also works on fire ant bites but that's another story.
"SXM is reporting the mosquitos will be worse due to all the standing water from the hurricane.Be diligent Folks, use protection.Ellen"
"Thanks Ellen, as I sit here wondering what we will find on our visit in two weeks, I hadn't thought of that. We will certainly pack the hard stuff. For me it means packing extra bug spray and not visiting some of the restaurants on my list, trivial compared to the time and expense Anguilla will go through recovering from such a strong hit.Prayers and best wishes to everyone on Anguilla who was affected by this storm. While I suppose this is a fact of life living on an island, it still has got to hurt and greatly impact the many who have had their property damaged. Thank God no injuries reported."
"Daffy, we were in Cancun a month after Wilma and were shocked at what we saw. The destruction was amazing, we were not prepared. At that time, there was no beach and the water was still churned up from the storm.Although this hurricane was not as bad as Wilma, this is still a small island with little resources to do the cleanup effort.My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Anguilla.Ellen"
