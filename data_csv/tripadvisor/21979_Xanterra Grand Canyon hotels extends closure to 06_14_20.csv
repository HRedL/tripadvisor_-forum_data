"Just saw this on the Grand Canyon Lodges page: ""All Grand Canyon National Park Lodges operations are being suspended through Sunday, June 14 due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus). We will keep information updated on this page. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and are currently taking reservations for Monday, June 15 and beyond. You can still make your vacation a reality this year – book in the summer, fall or winter now. The Grand Canyon is a timeless beauty, and you can still make time to experience this magnificent destination this year.""Have yet to see similar verbiage on the Yavapai Lodge page (www.visitgrandcanyon.com), but imagine they should follow suit shortly."

"Oh wow, thanks for sharing. Our lodging is booked for July......it's looking more and more like we won't be able to go. We have already decided for the most part that we won't be able to go.....now hearing this makes our trip even more unlikely."
Yes we were scheduled to stay the night of June 14th and got an email that we would automatically be refunded. Pretty bummed but glad they made the announcement now cause we had to decide on keeping our airfare or not by next Wednesday.
"We were scheduled there the 13 and 14th. And there goes my two week trip down the drain, but honestly I'm kind of happy it was decided by this instead of me trying to figure out if I wanted to risk going if everything was open. I will try again for next June, but I hate knowing I can't sign up 11 months ahead of time and have to wait until September. Honestly, even next June could be risky.Edited: 5:18 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"So the lodging is closed does that mean the park will also stay closed for that long?Edited: 11:12 pm, April 21, 2020 "
@Scheers - Whether the park will be open is unknown right now.
"The official word from Grand Canyon National Park and the National Park Service is that the Grand Canyon will remain ""closed until further notice."" This includes ""all visitor facilities, trails, and roads including Highway 64."" If you go to this link https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/grand… you'll see that the entrance station is cordoned off to everyone except people who live and work in Grand Canyon Village and can show proof of such.Edited: 12:18 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"So I don't get why they just updated the lodge page yesterday saying they were open for reservations starting June 15, 2020. Zion too. And ""The Oasis"" at my beloved Death Valley.I even did a trial reservation and got a remaining Bright Angel Cabin! Reliving that great first week of June 2018 June/Sedona, both GC rims/Zion trip!https:/…Why don't they just say closed indefinitely? No need to get folks hopes up if they aren't really going to open.Same with the Sky Ranch Lodge in Sedona, saying open May 1st."
"It is a hard situation because there is so much uncertainty. Unless there is a large surge in the virusnor something significant changes, Xanterra intends to open on June 15th, but with changes. But two months feels like ten months in Covid time, so who knows what will happen before then.I believe local NPS was eyeing a June date too, but with the governor and others pushing to open, the park may open sooner. If that happens, I bet it will be with reduced services - no shuttle buses, etc. If they find there are too many visitors and appropriate measures aren't being observed, they could take action like shutting down trails etc. Before the park shut down there were still a lot of visitors and not a lot of social distancing going on. I would still be wary about visiting when things open. And my two cents, if someone has an option to to postpone their trip, I think that is best. I think it would be better to visit the canyon when everything is running as normal. If shuttle buses aren't running and there are a lot of visitors, parking and getting around will be a chore (and even if buses are running, it will be at such a reduced capacity you will have to wait a long time at a shuttle stop). Some places like Hermit's Rest Road will only be accessible by bike/walking, restaurants will likely have reduced services, etc.And even once things open, the situation can change. The park has only had one documented case, but it is pretty isolated here. Once it opens and visitors come streaming in from everywhere, that could change and the park has to think about their workers and residents. Unfortunately, this is our new normal for awhile and I think everyone has to keep that in mind and be flexible with plans and scheduling."
