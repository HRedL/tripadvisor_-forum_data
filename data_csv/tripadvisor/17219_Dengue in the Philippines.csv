"We are traveling to the Philippines for 35 days in December. We are going to Vigan,san juan, manila, el nido and siargo. I have a 6 and 12 year old. Is the epidemic as bad as it says in the news? Very nervous but dont want to cancel. Any advice?"
"Yes, the epidemic is as bad as they say in the news - double the number of poor people have died this year as last year.Take precautions"
Don't wear dark clothes and use DEET spray or similar. I live in Palawan and so far this year i have not known anyone catch dengue yet. Usually i know a few friends that caught it in the previous 3 years.
"""Not known anyone in Palawan to have contracted Dengue"" ?Strange you should staTe that as Palawan had in excess of 1200 recorded cases in June 2019 according to Palawan-News ....the highest number of cases in MIMAROPA and 90% of all Malaria cases in 2018 were attributed to Palawan according to DOH.Let's have true facts and not biased information designed to influence the unwary traveler."
"Strange as it may sound, I know that the people are very friendly there, but PIMH may not actually know all of the people who live in Palawan"
"I recently visited Iloilo City that, like some other locations has had numerous cases of dengue.The media was suggesting that the major danger comes from stagnant water in which the mosquitoes breed. This is a particular problem in the least affluent areas where residents tend to leave out trays or pots of water overnight, and also during the day. I agree one ought endeavour not to wear dark coloured clothing. The less skin area exposed, the better. I use 'Rid' that is an effective Australian product.Apparently these mosquitoes are 'day biters', not just active at dusk and night time as I had incorrectly assumed. On Guimaras Island my seaside accommodation at The Clara (San Lorenzo) had a mosquito net for my bed but I didn't particularly notice any of these insects.I wouldn't panic, and as I just have, continuing to visit is the best policy.Edited: 1 year ago "
