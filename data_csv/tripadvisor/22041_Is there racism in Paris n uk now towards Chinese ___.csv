Chinese from Singapore not China in view of the corona virus
"You have nothing to worry about, but in case you want to have some Chinese meals in one of the Chinatowns (Olympiades or Belleville are the big ones), it has been reported that business is down a significant amount. So you might even get better service than usual by going there."

No this is the first time I’m posting as I feel this is a genuine concern after reading many reports online on Asians being attacked both verbally n physically
"<< after reading many reports online on Asians being attacked both verbally n physically >>Did any of these reports that you read take place in Paris? We have a huge Asian population, so that would be extremely unusual.Edited: 4:36 pm, February 21, 2020 "
"A Vietnamese friend of mine in Avignon was upset last week when an idiot in the street told her to go back to China and take her virus with her. I also have a Chinese friend in Avignon, but he has reported no problems."
Brainwashed sheeple watching fake news becoming paranoid is racism or is it brainwashed sheeple watching fake news becoming paranoid?
Similarly they are so many people canceling their trips to singapore due to the corona virus situation
They won't know you are Chinese from Singapore. You could be Chinese from any country in the world.
Exactly ! Though we can speak decent English but we r classified nonetheless ... so that is my concern where we will be less welcomed
Singapore is the source of the biggest outbreak so far in France -- it is loose in Singapore.
The spore govt is doing a great job here not as bad as the media protrays all cases r accounted for speaking from ground zero
"My American friend of Chinese heritage was in an elevator at work in La Defense. A woman in the elevator started yelling chinois, chinois and hit her with her hand bag.A guy at the playground with his two year old took her hand in left when two chinese-looking tourists came by. Yes. There is racism here because of the virus. But it won’t ruin your day. It’ll just remind you hiw ignorant humans can be."
"Kenny, You say you’re “classified”. Unless you go around wearing a badge to identify your ethnic background I still don’t see how people would know you’re Chinese from Singapore rather than Chinese from anywhere else."
"There are estimated to be 600,000 people of Chinese origin in France -- half of them were born in France and half have immigrated to France over the years. 80% of them live in the Paris metropolitan area. There are also 50,000 Chinese students in France.I would say there is less racism against the Chinese than against black or Arab people in France (most of whom were also born here). If the racists start adding the Chinese to their hate list, they are going to wear themselves out."
"What happens if a Chinese person becomes brainwashed by fake news and does similar behaviour towards a Chinese person sneezing, can they be self-racist? Is TV hysteria racism? CNN racist?400 years of oppression is the same as a month of CNN hysteria?People are turning on each other over hysteria from fear of dying equals racism? 400 years.."
At the end of the day if we are to come by uk n paris we just want to have an enjoyable trip ... I’m just everyone feels the same if they go overseas too
Then you have nothing to worry about.
"There is no racism against anybody. But there is definitely fear and ignorance out there.The virus is a serious concern and is it expanding. Really,2000 deaths out of a population of 1.4 billion? Yes, I know these people were loved will be remembered by their loved ones, but pragmatically it is an insignificant number.It is a preventable and treatable disease. Sadly, the media is all about yellow journalism. And the internet isnt helping.Edited: 8:34 pm, February 23, 2020 "
Yea they wont know for sure.. so is my concern valid in view of the virus?
"One would be foolish to think no racism exists. It exists everywhere worldwide. Chinese people have names for all sorts of non-Chinese folks as well.However, as a casual visitor, if you show manners and understanding to the local culture, 99.9% of the people you deal with are going to treat you just fine. Whenever I hear of people worrying about racism abroad, I always point out that they are discriminating against themselves from the very beginning. They become overly sensitive to the slightest negative experience. Carry yourself with confidence and respect your host. You will be just fine."
My point is has it increased because of the recent corona virus from the east ...Before that there was when I went but some sniggle n looks here n there which I find still bearable ...How about now ?
"Kenny, I’m having real trouble in reading your posts. Could you please resend it and leave out the text speak “n”, and what is a sniggle?Edited: 2:51 am, February 24, 2020 "
"The mainstream news is reporting that their viewers are indeed being brainwashed into fear from the nonstop news reports of virus outbreaks in Asian countries which is making these viewers afraid of anything Chinese. If the virus came from Iceland the same viewers would be afraid of anything coming from Iceland or if it came from Bordeaux France the wine market would collapse.So yes people are afraid from only watching nonstop mind control TV news programming.As for Asian racism does exist in and around Paris but more likely to have race tension problems that are territorial for neighbourhoods and their gangs rather than Paris' tourism.Anyone can go to YouTube and find examples of both.I used the keywords ""asian paris attacked"" to find a plethora of examples of both fear based abuse against the accused owners of the virus (the actual owners of the virus is the Queen of England and Bill Gates) and racist attacks against the Paris Chinese ongoing for years.There is a hashtag movement ""I am not a virus"" trying to defeat the fake news programming against the Chinese.Just be a tourist, visit tourist sites, enjoy your trip.However, I would be more concerned about being stuck on a grounded plane like the cruise ship passengers that at least had a cabin.."
"Neverminf the Chinese, we are now terrified of Italians."
Apologies for my Singlish ... the very unique n authentic form of English from Singapore... wat I meant was.. the previous trip for me back in 2014... I experience people giving us the look as we are the only Chinese in the restaurant .. teenagers coming from our back and shouted at us before running away laughing ... these r actions uncalled for when the virus wasn’t around ... how about now ? With the virus situation
"As an Asian travelling to France many times, I have never experienced any sort of ""racism"". Please, Kenny, stop focusing on that and you will be fine.However, as mentioned earlier, it is the grounding of planes and the every changing landscape of cities that have been ""quarantined"" and affects you travel route, that would be my main worry. Being stuck in ""Travel Limbo"" would be my concern."
@20 “There is no racism against anybody”Really? None? Who comes up with these comments?
"And #20 ought to immediately contact the WHO, the Italian, Korean, and Chinese governments, et al, since s/he has determined that COVID19 is both ""preventable"" and ""treatable"" which would be news to every health expert in the world, since there isn't a vaccine yet and many under current medical treatment have died.And don't understand the allegations of ""yellow journalism"" or media mind control made by #20 and others; should the media not report things like this? It's the WHO, not the media, which is warning of a pandemic. And a genuine pandemic spreads geometrically, so that current numbers would mean nothing.https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/art…And the virus hasn't just caused racists to feel justified in their actions; in both the US and Ukraine-and no doubt in other areas-fellow citiizens feel justified in attacking COVID19 evacuees.https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/21/ukrainia…https:/…erNo doubt if this weren't reported, the same people would be claiming a government/media coverup."
"Exactly, look at the WHO, CDC and Military prepare for this pandemic in October 2019 to educate yourself on what is to come regarding their plans, including martial law, which means what mainstream calls lockdown: https://youtu.be/WA2B6eAu7vcThe virus was created in 2015 and got its patent in 2018, the virus description in its patent includes its purpose is to used to create a vaccine, the company that owns the virus is controlled by the Queen of England and Bill Gates.All public information, anyone can do a patent lookup.CoronavirusPatent number: 10130701Abstract: The present invention provides a live, attenuated coronavirus comprising a variant replicase gene encoding polyproteins comprising a mutation in one or more of non-structural protein(s) (nsp)-10, nsp-14, nsp-15 or nsp-16.

Perhaps the most unhinged post ever on TA-except you failed to mention the Trilateral Commission.Where do you find this nonsense and why do you post it?

"Are you saying google, abc news are fake...Try a patent research, the owners are located just outside of London: https:/…Pirbright_InstituteTheir official website under partnerships/major stake holders..The WHO, CDC and others told us the plan back in October and we are watching it play out.But if you wish to say abc, google and the PB institute are all fake then live your life."
"AVT I have some respect for you but this is complete nonsense. The current Coronavirus strain was neither invented nor patented. Indeed, do a patent lookup, and then read it, and please try to understand it (and it you don't, which is fine because not everybody has a medical background, please don't spread lies about it).https:/…I'm hoping this is another form of your weird sense of humor."
"Scroll down to see the major stakeholder of the 2015 virus that is not the same virus: www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/Same name but not the same virus, right, okay, so we're back to bat soup..But leaning from Event 201 how to prepare is not real?"
"I cannot support post #20 completely, but there is some truth to it. The problem is more xenophobia than racism. Even the worst racists always claim to have some black, Asian or Jewish friends, and they do -- because they are local people that they know well. The people that they despise and fear are these scary people from other places.In any case, when I see Asian, African or other minorities in Paris, I assume that they are locals either born here or long term immigrants, so that is not at all a problem for me, even if just about anywhere, many people prefer people of their own race and culture out of ignorance.Over the past few years, there have been a lot of migrants in my area, and they are visibly not ""locals."" I have even more empathy for them since I have read all of the things that they have been through. I know that a lot of people hate their presence, but it seems totally normal to me.It is incredible to discriminate against people because they might have contracted a disease. My French next door neighbour might contract a disease at any moment. Or maybe it would be me."
"It's fear of dying according to these Parisians posted on the WHO channel, remember the WHO, someone earlier said the WHO was a conspiracy, doesn't change the fear in people.WHO channel, Parisians living in fear: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzgXU_Z9hLQSimilar story from France 24: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QnOQJJEPecLondon too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2dY0gQ8WmwSo call it what you want but the fear is real, and based on what the WHO planned in October I would seriously think about your plans. A lockdown in Italy did happened right or did I get that wrong.For the lighter side, yes I have a lighter side... my planets say tomorrow should be revealing."

Have mercy for the poor OP. The conversation on this thread has gone way off tangent.
"And this, my friends, is the Twilight Zone."
I think there has been plenty of answers to the OP's concerns. But discussions here have a life of their own.
From AFPhttps:/…and the BBChttps:/…world-us-canada-51599009
"OP, I hope the YouTube video news of Paris helped.That's the funniest attack on me ever..)But finally we agree to do one's own research. Start with EVENT 201, Pirbright Institute & Qinetiq."
"** That's the funniest attack on me ever..) **@ATF: Indeed, attack on you would be funny, if NOT ridiculous :-)"
"To the OP: I am Singaporean Chinese and I live and work in Paris. I have not experienced any difference in how people treat me and react to me at all. As some friendly advice to another Singaporean: I absolutely love Singlish and I speak ""full Singlish"" when I'm with other Singaporeans. But please try to develop some self-awareness - you seem to think that as a Singaporean you speak ""decent"" English, but based on this thread you are unable to switch from Singlish into standard English that non-Singaporeans can understand. (""Sniggle"" is not a word in Singlish or in English.) It suggests to me that you may encounter some communication problems in France, even with French people who speak English."
I will be traveling to the UK this May and am kinda worried with the racism thing since I’m traveling with my family (along with a toddler). Do most restaurants despise Asians ? The corona outbreak had showed us true colors between East and west
"Oh, don't be silly. First of all, this is the Parisian branch, so we don't know how you will be received in the UK, but they are a funny lot, let's be honest. Why on earth would restaurants despise Asians? Do they run out without paying? As for true colors, you seem to be showing some sort of bias yourself."
"bytez:I'm so embarrassed that people from my country (a pretty sophisticated place, in my view) keep asking these questions. Do you really think ""Do most restaurants despise Asians?"" is a constructive question? How would you feel if someone asked ""Do most Chinese in Singapore discriminate against Indians?""It's true that one Chinese-Singaporean guy has experienced an unprovoked and violent racist attack on the streets of London, and I suppose other racist incidents do occur against people with Chinese appearance in the UK and Paris for reasons related and unrelated to the coronavirus. But I reckon the likelihood of getting your pocket picked remains far higher."
One of the things you can count on is that Parisians are not in any way responsible for the actions of the British-nor are the British responsible for the actions of any other nationality.Why in the world would you post this question on the Paris forum?
"World being a curate's egg, possible racism/ignorance incidents should not impede travel plansEdited: 3:55 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"The world would be a wonderful place without racist morons. However we all seem to have more than a fair share. Even Singapore.If you think you are having problems with Singlish, try speaking English with a Kiwi accent....only Australians understand us.Edited: 1:36 am, March 04, 2020 "
"At the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, patients' parents have been refusing for their children to be attended to by Asian doctors and nurses! There are ignorant people everywhere in this world."
That sounds pretty ridiculous especially since the problem has now been dissociated from its possibly Chinese origin and is now worldwide.But crooks have incredible imaginations.
I had a group of gentleman look in my direction and say corona on a train ride. They also continued talking say covid19 and then pretending to cough. I ignored them.
They are late to the game if this happened in France. Nearly all of the French patients are French.
"Realistically speaking, even in normal times, your typical person in European countries are not fond of non-white people (bags checked at check-out counters, your occasional verbal abuser, etc...). It will probably be a few years before Asians are welcome in many parts of the world again."
"@#62, as an Asian I have never felt unwelcome in any place in Europe. You get what you give. If you are polite and follow common courtesies you will be fine."
"Walkabout Jack, How dare you insinuate the average European is racist ? I think it would be prudent to get your own house in order prior to pointing the finger at others. Apart from a very small minority we are a happy multinational community. I dare say all the racist gun touting bigots over the pond will get this removed."
"Conversation I once had with a Malaysian waiter in Langkawi, Malaysia :Waiter : Where have you visited in Malaysia?Me : I landed in Kuala Lumpur so I started with a few days there.Waiter : Kuala Lumpur, it's a bad place.Me : Why?Waiter : Too many Chinese.Me : Oh, what do they do that is so bad?Waiter : Well not OUR Chinese, but the Chinese from China.Me : I'll have the chicken rendang please..."
"** Realistically speaking, even in normal times, your typical person in European countries are not fond of non-white people...... **The OP was hoping to learn about isolated incidence of racism and not to make fodder for bigotry binge."
