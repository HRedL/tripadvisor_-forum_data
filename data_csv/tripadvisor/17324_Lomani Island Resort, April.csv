"Hello! Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do with, or offload, a non-refundable hotel room? Unable to use a Bungalow w/ Private Pool, Beachfront. Just found out my wife is pregnant and we opted to stay on the very safe side and sit this one out with CDC issuing a Zika warning for Fiji.Edited: 2 years ago "
I would check with the Island resort direct and explain the situation. In some cases they may refund you or ask for a doctors certificate to confirm first.
Travel Insurance may cover it. You could try advertising it.
Is your reservation transferable -- dates?A
"Thank you! I did try. And do have a doctor's note, but no luck, unfortunately."
Yes it is transferrable. It is from This Sunday through Friday. April 1st - April 6th.
"Got really close on travel insurance. On my credit card it is included, and we got close. But an unwillingness to travel due to a pandemic or epidemic was not included."
Are the dates changeable? -- am planning to visit but not until September.
"I can check, but I don't think so."
I just checked and dates cannot be changed.
Maybe try selling it on facebook Fiji holiday groups or any groups that might have members in Fiji already.
