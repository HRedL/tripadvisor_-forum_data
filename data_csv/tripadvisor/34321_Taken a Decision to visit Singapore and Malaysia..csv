Dear TeamThank You so much all of you i have read many thread conversation on corona virusAnd taken a decision to visit Singapore and malesiya with proper precautionsi am leaving tomorrow from Mumbai I hope i will enjoy my trip with my wife.
Hope all goes well. Keep us posted on the forums.
All the very best for a safe and enjoyable trip.
Hi. And I'm coming on thursday to Singapore and yogyakarta if no fco advice against travel by then. Be interested to hear of others still planning to visit. Wishing everyone safe travels
We are doing same trip as you.stay safe and maybe see you there
"Enjoy your trip. Keep checking Singapore MOH website for updated information, advisories and press releases and take all precautions recommended by MOH."
"This is the link MRahul refers tohttps://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanEdited: 4:17 am, February 11, 2020 "
Well done. Wash hands every so often after touching things and you will be fine. Enjoy your trip
Your decision to visit Singapore is not appreciable. Incubation period 24 days is about to come after first symptom appeared. Santosha and USS may be vanrable place to infect. Be informed and do safe there.
All being well I'm still planning g to come tomorrow unless fco changes its advice. My family there say it's ok.also planning g 3 days yogyakarta. Hard to tell if Indonesians have travel restrictions for flights from Singapore. Heard that sarawak is quarantining arrivals from sg but I assume.e that's only if have symptoms? Anyone else still planning to.go?
"Vivien safe travels,I've updated my other thread with 2 useful videos to see what measures can be taken to protect yourself in Singapore. I share again below for your ease of review. Hope it helps.VIDEO DORSCON ORANGE IMPACT IN SINGAPOREhttps://youtu.be/dNeJmgZXK3YVIDEO Gov.Sg HOW DAILY LIFE AFFECTEDhttps://youtu.be/kR6XnYOk0HcEdited: 9:00 am, February 12, 2020 "
Give it a rest Bill...
Thanks ccC，Ummmm someone spotted this......Cheers!
ccCookie - not sure if you've seen the Gov.Sg video or the other one. If I was a newcomer to Singapore - I might actually appreciate it.
"We are coming next Friday unless anything changes in that time. I find it odd how breaking news in the UK was that one new case had developed, but the fact that 80plus people who have been in quarantine for two weeks after flying back from Wuhan are all fine barely even made the news! Seems to be a lot of scaremongering going on!"
"Helsbels ... actually, I'm planning to arrive in Singapore (for over the 20th time) in a few weeks. None of the hype posted here would make me reconsider. A few days ago, the prices dipped a little bit due to people being spooked and trying to cancel reservations, or so I thought. I actually booked a favourite haunt for about 25% less than usual. Maybe it was just a one-off sale, however.Checking to see if prices are continuing to go down, now I notice that the prices are starting to rise again. I wouldn't be able to make the same reservation now at that price.Every time a new snippet of information is reported it seems that some are jumping to post it here as though they have the inside and ""more terrifying than ever"" scoop. It has become overblown. Reminds me of the fear mongering regarding Y2K. Maybe not quite as absurd, but similar ..."

"Dear SigI am of a mind that it is ""OK for me."" Yes. I couldn't care less if you (or anyone else) cancelled. Kindly do not put words into my mouth.Who exactly did I ""put down"" if you don't mind ...?Bad news is what gets reported. You should know that. It is what sells papers. ""Everything is great today ... nothing to see here"" has never been the headline, now has it.At one point 17 of the first page of 20 posts in this forum concerned the virus. This is ""overblown"" as I stated. You think that it is nasty that I state the obvious? Unkind?Similar to political divisions ... ? You've lost me Sig.The aid I should be offering travelers on this forum is that they shouldn't travel? Really. Because of 50 cases of a virus among millions of people. Otherwise I'm being nasty. And not tolerating disagreement. C'mon Sig ... settle down."

Just to say thank you for everyone's posts. Feels good to be part of a community even though not always a consensus on decisions to take. I'm at Heathrow waiting to board hoping maybe to get an upgrade assumed plane be half empty but was told at check.in that it was quite full and Singapore airlines not reducing prices! There are two flights out this evening. I'm curious as to how things will be on the ground. Good luck to every one.
"The only people that don't think that it is business as usual, Vivien, seem to be here on this forum.Careful what you say or it will be interpreted as nasty and intolerant. Have fun in Singapore!"
"Vivien please update us when you get there as to how it is! We are visiting for the first time in a week and would love to see some posts about Singapore again, rather than coronavirus!"
"For #19 of 23If it was one of your friends or colleagues at your work who was 1 of the 58 cases, or 1 of the 8 in critical condition, perhaps you’d say to one and all, Delay if you got a baby, or come if you must but for the sake of reducing communal spread at least watch a government video. If you want to put your head in the sand while this thing grows from Jan 23 1 caseFeb 14 58 casesOr ignore the fact that the Government didn’t just randomly up DORSCON to Orange (3rd highest threat level next to lockdown, same as for SARS If you want to pretend it’s not as bad as flu when there is no vaccine for Covid 19 but there is for flu,If you want to pretend we don’t get temperature tested twice a day at work, or if a case is suspected, 300 people are evacuated asap If you still want to pretend this is “nothing” and newcomers who believe you, will relax as they do at home and not observe heightened measures the Government have set out...Then what can I say except - Happy Valentine’s Day for lack of better words and God bless you!"
"You're truly virtuous Bill. And, ... I'm coming to Singapore, and so I'm a bad guy. These things are all self evident.By the way, of the 58 cases ... some have returned home, no? Maybe gotten better? Do we get to subtract those numbers from the 58 ever? Just curious ... no soapbox virtue signalling please.Hope you're able to return your attention to work soon..."
"I use this page for the latest news https:/…wuhan-virusOf the 58, 5 were in quarantine after being evacuated from Wuhan, so never mixed with the public15 are now clear of the virus, https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo… and one of the critically ill is no longer critical, as yet there are no deaths in Singapore.Meanwhile life goes on.Yesterday we took a taxi to Labrador MRT, the driver kept the windows open, then my wife had a coughing fit - it's not an infection, it's a long term problem, probably genetic. Anyway the driver gave both of us masks, great news, because we haven't seen any in the shops since the virus hit Singapore.We had a nice walk along the boardwalk into Labrador Park, the boardwalk was a lot busier than the last time we were there. Saw macaques, monitor lizards and other things.We then took a taxi to Beach Station for lunch at McDonalds. We sat outside, and upwind, but they had very few customers.We relaxed on Palawan beach for the afternoon, yes it was rather lonely, but it was very safe.Finally to Resorts World by a nearly empty monorail. We ate takeaway chicken rice near the Universal globe, because we prefer eating on our own to eating in restaurants. We had a nice walk around an extremely quiet RW.Finally a taxi back to our hotel. When we reached Singapore in January, we normally had to join the queue for a taxi, now we just get in the first taxi in the long line of taxis waiting for customers (bad for the drivers, good for us)."
"HeatSeeker:Wow, ... this is exactly the type of post that those poor indecisive folk could use in making a decision as to whether or not they cancel plans for Singapore.Nice to hear simple, unvarnished observations/information. Very nice ..."
"Travel Safely ccC00kie - HeatSeeker is really enjoying himself, so will you. Take care when are here and you will be fine."
Sig79 ... where are you?Better look at #21 here!https:/…105503941I detect nastiness and intolerance.
"Just to say that DORSCON being orange does NOT mean that the situation is tragic. Have you read the DORSCON levels that were explained last week on all the newspapers? Orange means there is community spread but it's limited. If it had been 1 person who got it locally or 1000, they would have done the same (ok maybe 1 wouldn't have been enough but you get what I mean). The temperature checks etc. are precautions to help limit the spread. Yes, the growth in number looks grim but how many of them were in the same church?If 1 of the 8 people in critical conditions was close to me yes, I'd be sad and worried for them. If I knew someone affected but not in critical condition I wouldn't panic too much. I'd probably be quarantined as well! Btw remember Swine Flu, which was also going to wipe out human race? A friend of mine caught it. She told us herself when she recovered and went on with her life.Technically, someone in my workplace got it but it's an extremely large employer so it was nowhere near anywhere I go. Anywhere else in the area is as busy as it normally is. The lift smelled strongly of disinfectant this morning.I disagree that ""the only people who don't think it's business as usual are on this forum"" - there is only one such person here. I am on a mission to tell people that it is not a war zone (and yes, I might have trolled at some point) because the scaremongering in my home country is at soul-destroying levels and has even caused episodes of racism towards Asian-looking people. Then I ended up in the English-speaking section as well.Admittedly, a lot of my friends have decided to lock themselves in. I wonder if it's because they don't work and so they are not forcibly socialised so the fear takes hold. But surely if they go to the shops or wherever they will see things are pretty normal, maybe a bit quieter but that's more visible in tourist areas. Shops in my neighbourhood this evening looked as busy as usual. Maybe the hawkers were 1% quieter but it was also relatively early and one hawker had a huge queue (I was only passing by)."
"Life does indeed go on. We adapt. That’s what we’re good at. Someone made the analogy of what happened after 9/11. Initially widespread panic, racism, paranoia. All of those things have come true here as well. However, and joyfully, despite that, just look at HeatSeeker and his Mrs, out there, to the beach and exciting places, adventurous and having stories to tell those back home. Respect. I stand by my advice, that will not change, but I’m no world authority on something I have less than 1 months experience of. I think we can all be right because there is no one decision that’s right for all of us. And that doesn’t mean we should belittle each other like kids, each one standing his ground.Edited: 8:26 am, February 14, 2020 "
"And I disagree on DORSCON Orange. It is significant and not made lightly. If anyone wants to know more go look it up yourselves. In my other post I broke it down in detail. I even sent an email to my HR to explain some of the finer points that weren’t clear. Will be shared if it’s shareable.Edited: 8:30 am, February 14, 2020 "
Just booked a staycation for next week.....good deal....Cheers!

"I've been planing a trip to Singapore in May, I'm still planning on coming, even though friends (local Chinese) seem extremely anxious about the situation."
"I'll be in Singapore a few weeks in advance of your visit.There's 4 return flights from Dubai to Singapore daily ... all as usual. Gaggles of tour groups at the Dubai mall ... as usual. Including Chinese tour groups, if that is of any interest. They seem to like to purchase chocolate. Me too. We have face masks in Dubai. We even have our very own post regarding the virus on the Dubai Trip Advisor forum; there are 6 replies. I think that I saw another post the other day, but I can't find it now. Unfortunately, the Dubai forum doesn't have anyone to continuously bump the posts up to 1st page.If you're not planning on retroactively attending a sermon at the Grace Assembly of God Church in Singapore, you should be fine. However, John, a sermon on 'DORSCON Orange' and other ramblings we cannot save you from ..."
"Hi John, May is still a way always. Suggest to monitor. No one can predict this thing up or down, so far only up."
"Hi Sandeep,R u in Spore now? I know, it's not the best time.Can u pls describe the situation in general around Orchard Rd? We r going next week. :]Thx.Kenny"
"I can't answer for Orchard Rd, but this is the situation as I've seen it over the last few days. I stress that most people are really bad at risk assessment in these circumstances, so in the end you must make your own decision.Sentosa is well down on visitors, with USS reducing its opening hours, other businesses in Resorts World are closing early, and it's very quiet in the evenings.Yesterday we went to Bedok, visited the outdoor market which was extremely busy. Then we headed to East Coast Park, and that was also very busy, it was a glorious day, and a lot of local people came there to enjoy the weather.Before deciding what to do, look at https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294… for lots of helpful advice"
"HiI'm here now and all seems as usual.tho a little quieter.if I didnt know there was a ""crisis"" I wouldnt notice any difference"
"Thank u Heatseeker n Vivien for the updates, and I'll do the same when I get there next week.Thx again.Kennu"
"The numbers in Singapore isn’t stopping. We leave in March but planning to leave our kids with my parents. The trip was suppose to be for our kids, I will feel so guilty when I go. We will end up paying double is we cancel or reschedule. Don’t know what will happen in the next month or so. Fingers cross things will slow down"
"Dear BadPeach,Everything is still open here. Nothing is closed. I think if its two adults, and you cant get a refund, and you don't have kids going with you who you would have needed to watch, control what they touch and what they put in their mouths, you will probably be ok with increased hygiene and vigilance.For your continued monitoring please review herehttps://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…Whatever you decide is right.Bill"
"As i said,everything feels pretty normal.i.cone every year and I really wouldnt notice much difference from previous visits.malls and restaurants quite busy. Schools seem to be operating as usual albeit with temperature checks and sanitizer. I'm off to yogyakarta for 3 days tomorrow so be interesting to see how that is. I wouldnt advise anyone not to come to Singapore."
Just spent 3 days in Singapore. Everything fine just a little bit less busy. Now in jogyakarta indonesia for 3 more days  They claim not to have even one case of the virus but who.knows what the real.figures are. Not so vigilant re using sanitiser but a fair number of masks. All.quiet at both airports. Back to Singapore on Friday. I'm really pleased I didnt cancel. Hope everyone has safe and enjoyable trips
"Hi Vivien, Great to know you had a great time!keep your standards up. Some countries arent as transparent with their figures as Singapore is. They have good reason, tourism is a major factor of their economy. They want you to think all is normal, even when it might not be. Therefore if you practise your high standards, even if the locals do not, you will be better off. Hope your adventures never end!Bill"
"Hi Vivien.We'll boarding in an hour, flying to Spore for 4 days n then Jakarta. Thx for ur Spore trip update, kudos, n hope u have a nice n safe visit in Yogjakarta, too. KennyEdited: 10:47 am, February 18, 2020 "
Hi .thanks for your warm replies.yogyakarta fine so far but as you say standards of hygiene not great! No sanitizer bottles anywhere.sometimes no washing facilities in cafes and restaurants or public toilets. Glad I stocked up on sanitisedr before coming g though my local Boots in suburban London had sold out! Back to Singapore Friday.This will be my last trip as family moving to Bangkok next. Whole lot of new challenges!  It seems the planes are still.pretty full because of the transit passengers to Australia not necessarily stopping over.Happy travels everyone
Hi Kenny.....happy trip and happy holiday too in SG..Please update information in there if have time....Well.....great to read all about Vivian said too....safety in SG.....should be travel go SG in next month if no problem....
HiYes everything fine so far. Back to sg tomorrow and back to london on Monday. I certainly wouldnt put anyone off coming g at the moment. Any one individuals chances of contracting it are infinitesimal. People don't understand probability. It's like the lottery. It could be you but it probably wont be. Public health concerns and individual risk are 2 different things.Safe and happy travels
"Vivien, U r absolutely right about the lottery think, me n family r fine in Spore. We went to Orchard, MBS n Chinatown, used taxis/ Grab, so far so good. Most places provide sanitizer before u enter the building or n body temperature checks here in Spore now, dont think they do that in Yogjakarta.Good luck with Bkk.@fellow travellers, it's safe to visit Spore, my point is if u got it, then it's meant to be, as that Covid-19 case that happened in Swiss Alp, still precaution is needed.ThxKenny"
"""Public health concerns and individual risk are 2 different things.""Well said Vivien ..."
"HI Kenny,The case that happened in the Swiss Alps could not have been prevented imo. The guy did not show any symptoms while in Hong Kong or in Swiss Alps, yet he was able to spread it making more than 100 people to have to get tested and lead to a high number of infections to many people in different countries.As such he was considered to be a Super Spreader.It is almost impossible to know if you have it. if you have not had the specific test for it, until the incubation period of up to 2 weeks is over, if you are not initially showing any symptoms.So you could be in Singapore and not know if you are spreading it if you are not showing signs within the first few days of returning home.Take care and take caution. Do not let up your hygiene even if anyone says ""its ok"". Prevention is better than cure.Edited: 3:40 pm, February 20, 2020 "
It seems like the numbers are slowing down. My husband ha decided we go as a family as Singapore seems to be the safest. We leave in 3 weeks so fingers cross things are better than. Hope whoever is travelling to any country to have a safe trip!
