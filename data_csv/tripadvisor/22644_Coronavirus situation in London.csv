I’m travelling to London in April and would like to know the situation there. I know London has not been hit yet and I just need to be sensible and watch out for hygienic. I’m more concerned with the behaviour of Londoners as I’ve read reports of incidents targeting Asians. Would appreciate any info on this as news media might not be reporting or scaremongering.

"'I’m travelling to London in April and would like to know the situation there.' As would a great many infectious diseeases specialists. Given the situation, what will happen next week is as unknown as what will happen in April.'I’m more concerned with the behaviour of Londoners as I’ve read reports of incidents targeting Asians.' Should there be any 'targeting Asians' the behaviour of a person who might do that would be a discrete and independent event. One person misbehaving does not imply that 'the behaviour of Londoners' would be the same."
"At the moment (touch wood and wash your hands afterwards) the UK as a whole is in the big picture unscathed. That could change of course, so watch this space. And take reasonable precautions (wash your hands frequently, carry and use hand sanitizer, use tissues to wipe your face instead of your hands, and carry/use “clorox” wipes or similar) all of which minimize the spread of colds and flu, not just this virus. Abuse of Asians citing the virus is despicable. There have been a few isolated incidents in the UK, but it’s also been happening in other countries too, so isn’t just a UK issue. Watch this space, take reasonable precautions, and have a great trip."
"The Coronavirus should be put into perspective with other diseases such as flu which kill more people usually those with underlying health issues such as respiratory diseases or the elderly. I personally feel that the media cover is making people more worried than they should be. At the end of the day people are involved every day in car crashes but that does not stop us driving our cars, Good hand hygiene washing hands in hot water with soap singing happy birthday twice and using hand sanitizing products makes sense. Our hospitals already have in place protocol for dealing with infectious diseases. Sadly, there are a lot of ignorant people out there who bully others and should be challenged. Hate crime is an offence and can be reported to the Police. Enjoy your trip and don't worry. I have been to the US twice and did not get shot."
Asians are being targeted??? That is scary!! Not all Asians live in Asia...Many Europeans and Americans live in Asia and may have been recently come back from Asia. Give Asians some love!!
"""I know London has not been hit yet and I just need to be sensible and watch out for hygienic....actually Im sorry to say London has been 'hit but not badly""I’m more concerned with the behaviour of Londoners as I’ve read reports of incidents targeting Asians....I've not heard of any incidentsDon't forget London is multi cultural so we have a lot of Asian people living and working here anyway"
"I'm in town at present. And apart from an occasional face mask, nothing apparent."
"What happens in April happens in April. If you're feeling unsafe, you can always leave. Carpe Diem and have fun!"
