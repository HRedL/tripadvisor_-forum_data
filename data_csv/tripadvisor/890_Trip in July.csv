"Hi we have a family trip booked for July 15th to include Tulum, Holbox and Cancun. What are the chances of this going ahead, does anyone live in Mexico that has some insider info?!"
"I'm also looking to book but much later in the year. I don't think anyone will be able to advise you on this yet though, it's far too soon. Hang in there though, hopefully you'll be able to book something soon."
"I'm in Mexico, but can't give you an answer. I've read reports that the number of COVID-19 cases might peak around July."
