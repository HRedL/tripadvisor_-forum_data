Just heard easyjet cancelling all flights in and out of lanzarote from monday.
Source?
"Any news on Ryanair as we are due to fly out a week today , they will allow you to swap your flight for free to a later date but still fancy coming to Playa Blanca. Does anyone know if the Mainland lockdown includes Lanzarote as I have searched and cannot see any mention of it on line"
"Looks like the whole of Europe will be on “lockdown” within about a week or so. I personally do not believe the Spanish government will take any chances on its people in the Canaries, to do so would be political suicide. Better we all accept that we will not be going on holiday anywhere ,at least in the short term , but probably longer."
