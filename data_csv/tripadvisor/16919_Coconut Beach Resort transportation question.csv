"Hello and Bula to all! Just booked airfare to Fiji Aug 26-Sept 2. This will be our first trip to Fiji (wife and I) and I just had a few questions about transportation to the resort. I understand that to get to Coconut Beach Resort you really have only 2 options. The Flyer ferry, or to take a seaplane transfer. My question is, what is your advice for using these options with our flight times in mind.Land NAD- August 26th 0500 Fiji Airways Depart NAD- Sept 2 @ 2130With these times in mind I was wondering if it is a reasonable plan to make the 0830 Yasawa Flyer to get to the resort? I think it will be a nice way to relax and watch the islands. I understand it is something like 4.5 hours to reach the resort? Second question is about the return trip. I would like to take a seaplane back to NAD the day of our return trip. What time would you schedule the seaplane to pick us up at Coconut Beach Resort for the 930PM flight? I have read that the last scheduled seaplanes fly about 3pm? Thanks in advance as we plan this exciting trip to Fiji! Bula!"
"Bula, and welcome to the forum IUBBFAN.You will have plenty of time to connect with the Yasawa Flyer. It takes about 20 minutes to get from Nadi Airport to Port Denarau where the Flyer departs from. There are markets should you want to pick up some snacks. Will be cheaper than purchasing them at the resorts.The seaplane should get you back in plenty of time for your flight home. Fiji Airways opens their gate for check-in 3 hours prior to the flight departing, and closes 1 hour before the flight departs.To help keep the price down, recommend purchasing alcohol at the duty free shop at the airport in Nadi for having drinks in your bure. We can't purchase our brand of choice in Fiji, so take the amount of alcohol allowed by customs in our checked luggage. As this is your first trip to Fiji, have a look at the following for other suggestions of what to take with you, and helpful information. Though it can no longer be edited, it is still relevant.https:/…Faq.What.Do.We.Need.To.Bring.htmlHope this helps. Have a wonderful vacation, and enjoy your count down till you arrive in paradise."
"From experience, the seaplane provider asks for your onward flight’s departure time when you book. They will get you back in time for that flight, but won’t always be able to accommodate a request to fly, say late afternoon versus earlier in the day. Note - they can only fly during daylight.The day before you travel, they will advise the resort what time you will return. It will be based on your request, the weather, and the travel plans of others in the area. It’s an amazing way to see the Fijian Islands and well worth doing."
"Agree about the Flyer. Best to book the Captains Lounge - it is a little higher cost but very comfortable seating, being on the upper deck you get best views, and all snacks and drinks are included in the price.The Flyer has a complimentary coach that picks up from the airport - you will get details of time when booking (ask your resort to book for you) - or if you don’t want to wait for the coach then a taxi will get you to Denarau more quickly. You then have plenty of time to sit with a coffee and snack while waiting for the boat.Book your seaplane for mid- afternoon - and be prepared for them to change the flight time, it happens frequently when they have to fit in with others. If you get back to Nadi earlier, the Gateway hotel across the road from the airport welcomes casual visitors, they will store your luggage securely and you will have the use of their restaurant, even the pool for no cost. We usually do just that and there are plenty of places to sit by the pool or in the garden or restaurant."
Thank you so much for the tips on our first trip to Fiji! It makes me happy to know that I should have enough time to catch the Ferry as well as have enough time on the return. Looking forward to seeing the Yasawa's with my own eyes!
"Happy to help.If you opt to take a taxi from the airport to Port Denarau, you will need FJD. Would exchange money at the Western Union office at the airport in Nadi. Much better exchange rate than at LAX. Recent posts here mention the cost to be around 35 FJD. Be sure to confirm the price before getting in, and get some bills in small dominations as the driver may not be able to make change.Edited: 4:06 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Bula IUBBFAN,Coming late onto the thread I would just like to add that I agree with Post #3 that for such a long water transfer the captains lounge with it's free snacks and drinks would be the way to go.Just a note on Coconut beach we traveled there in May 2018 (trade winds in Fiji between May and October but not all the time) and found the resort very windy. It blew for the whole time we were there and 8 days before we arrived. My profile shows the seaplane out the front of the resort and how choppy the waters were. We had to walk about 300mtrs around the corner to get out of the wind and snorkel in their small reef which is a little out of the wind. You cannot swim out the front of the resort.Unfortunately the resort faces East and is open to the ocean.The beachfront villa have their patio on the side and not facing the ocean so it shows how windy it can get.In saying all that the staff were wonderful and the food was great.It was just the wind that spoilt it for us but that is not the resorts fault.Another thing that might be of interest as you are a first time traveler to FijiFiji works on 240 volt power with an angled plug like for Australia and NZ. Many of the resorts you may wish to go to may not have adapters available. I would suggest you bring one from home to charge your ipad, camera and phone.With the adapter you just need to make sure the electronic devices you plug into it eg hairdryer has ""Input: AC 1.5A 100-240V 50/60Hz"" or similar written on it somewhere. A power converter is not required in this case. Most devices will work on either 110 Volts or 240 Volts when plugged into a suitable adapter but do check the device labeling before use."
"The Yasawa Flyer departs Denarau Marina at 8.45am daily. It arrives at about 1 pm. Coconut Beach boat will meet the ‘Flyer’.It costs no more to have the resort do the bookings fo you. They will send you confirmation and you pick up your ticket from the Marina when you ‘check in’.They can also arrange your seaplane return trip too. Let the resort know your flight time, you have choice of Turtle Airways or Pacific Island Air, the latter is probably best as it lands at the airport and is a very short walk to International Check in. You will be there in plenty of time for your departure flight.There is a free coach transfer to the Marina for guests travelling to the islands from the airport. We prefer to get a taxi. You will have time to have a coffee or breakfast at the Marina. Lulus Cafe next to the check in area opens early. There is a supermarket at the Marina too if you want to purchase snacks etc. I suggest you book in the Captains Lounge on the Yasawa Flyer it is more comfortable and you get free drinks and snacks with easy access to the outer deck.We have done the trip many times the views of the islands along the way are an excursion in itself. Our favourite Bure at Coconut is bure 6, more private and beachfront."
"""""I would like to take a seaplane back to NADI the day of our return trip.""""Just a note Seaplanes and helicopters only fly during daylight hours and have to be back to base during those hours too so you will have plenty of time for your airline connection.Coconut beach resort has showers and a toilet at the back of the main reception building so if your plane leaves in the afternoon you can book out of your room and still use the facilities until later on."
"You can request a departure time for flight and they will do their best. We requested transfer around 4.30 but 3.45 was what they could offer. Not that it mattered. If you get an earlier return you can visit one of the hotels opposite the airport, most people use the Gateway Hotel, they have free transfers to and from the airport. They will hold your luggage for you. You can have a snack or drink at the coffee lounge or bar or a meal in the restaurant, more pleasant than sitting in the airport terminal waiting to check in."
As mentioned in post #3 the gateway hotel is a great option as they have complimentary transfers back and forward from the hotel. We stay there on our return from the islands and the food we found was good also.
"You will probably only need the hotel for a couple of hours if you manage to get a late transfer. Check in opens 3 hours prior to departure and closes one hour prior. The hotel has a coffee lounge behind the bar area, you can order snacks."
"Thanks again for all of the feedback on the trip to the resort! I will plan on leaving Coconut Beach Resort no later than 3PM and then we can spend a few hours on the main island. I will check out the Gateway, thanks for that tidbit!"
You are welcome. Hope the trip goes well with no issues
"Enjoy Coconut Beach it is a beautiful part of Fiji. The staff are amazing. Please write a review when you return .My profile photo is of one of the beautiful beaches.Edited: 7:22 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Hopefully this coronovirus epidemic will have been sorted by the time you want to go.
One would hope the Coronavirus will be long gone by August it is a long way off .
Some resorts are giving you the opportunity to reschedule without losing your deposit or money paid.
"Yes they are. This has happened with our Bali trip supposed to leave Thursday. We have credit vouchers for flights to be used within 12 months, no fees and accommodation cancelled without charge."
I did notice just yesterday that Fiji Airways have now come on board and are now allowing credits to transfer to another date.This is great news for us as we are in a wait and see pattern for our June Fiji trip.At this stage looks like all our accommodation and flights are changeable at no costs.
"Do you know if this is true for Los Angeles to Fiji flights? We are booked July 9-24th. Not sure if the situation will settle enough by July to travel internationally and to such a remote location. We only paid deposit on resort bookings which is due in April. Thinking of switching and going to Hawaii instead since then we won’t need to go through customs upon return. Any advice? We are supposed to stay at Octopus, Blue Lagoon, Paradise Cove in the Yasawas with two kids ages 13 and 10."
"Keeping our fingers crossed that this whole situation will be figured out by late August! Good luck to the rest of you with your travel plans as well. Living in Seattle currently and this is all happening on our doorstep, so to speak! Thanks again for all of the great information. And I will be sure to write a review once we return from Coconut Beach! I will also likely have some more questions for the forum before we embark on our journey to Fiji!"
"Hopefully, things will return to normal by July, bunako.I would contact the resorts regarding changing dates/canceling. This the latest from Fiji Airways dated March 16. Would monitor the below link. There is other information in the below link, which gets updated.https:/…HERE IS SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR RE-BOOKINGS We realise that many guests may wish to defer travel at this time. Fiji Airways is offering increased flexibility for guests wishing to change their flights to defer travel without any change fees or hold credit for later travel (a fare difference may apply, especially if partner airlines are involved in the booking). If guests wish to change their travel dates, they can do so without incurring any fees (reissue fees and fare difference included) should they travel by 30 June 2020. There will be no reissue fees (fare difference fee will apply) should guests wish to travel after 30 June, 2020. If your flights were booked through a travel agency or third-party website (for example Trip.com, Webjet or others), you will need to contact these companies directly to make changes to your booking. Fiji Airways is unable to make changes to bookings done by third-party websites. The same conditions listed above will apply. If you are unsure as to when you would like to travel, you can have your fare held in credit. Upon rebooking, any change fees will be waived."
bunako I have contacted the resorts we were due to go to in June and they were very accommodating with changing the dates at no cost along with the Nadi hotel we are staying at should we need to re do our bookings which is probably on the cards right now.No sure if you just want to cancel though. Do check with the resorts involved.
