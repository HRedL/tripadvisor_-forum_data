"Although we're staying at the North Shore, Janet recommended the Bon Dance with the finale being held last night at Hanapepe. After half a day of snorkeling at Tunnels, we cleaned up and headed for the south shore.  We had visited Kilauea a the previous day (the farmers market, among other things) and had taken some pictures. Unfortunately, when I downloaded them onto my laptop, they were deemed ""corrupt"". Of particular importance to me were the pics we had of the monk seal sunbathing on the rock there in the middle of the cove. Also, a tour guide showed us a bush and told us about the Hawaiian legend where two separate flowers unite to make one single flower, symbolizing a marriage. We found out later from a gardener that true Hawaiian legend has the young man getting his half flower from the mountain plant and bringing it to unite it with the plant located on the lower elavations. It a neat little story and I wanted to relate it to my daughter and grand daughters. We took a side road (no outlet) and went to look at the homes and their beautiful array of plants and flowers. Seems like everything was in full bloom. We snapped a picture of the red dirt and how some homes incorporate it into their landscaping-stunning. Coconut trees all over the place. We stopped at Anahola beach and found it to be in need of some cleaning up.  There was some free raffle for shirts/hats, etc. going on in Kapaa and we got there towards the tail end. People seemed to be having good time. The shaved ice stand was somewhat of a magnet also. We had planned to attend mass at ST. Conception so we had an hour to kill and we did that at Costco. On the way out, we stopped for a slice of pizza but we didn't want to have pizza breath in mass, so we left it in the car for that hour. When we returned, it was covered with ants-adios pizza. The mass was nice. At the beginning of the service, they as visitors to stand then some ladies come around and present you witha lei. The lady that plays the piano as sings is a one person choir. I fell in love with her voice. Wow!! After mass, we, headed to Hanapepe for the Bon Dance finale. They had food booths and a few games for the kiddos but the main attraction was the Dance. It was something special to see the ladies, young and old, dressed up in colorful Oriental gowns. The little girls also looked dolls and as they participated in this cultural event. The women looked so graceful and confident as the went trough an intricate series of moves while the drummers kept the beat. There were different songs and each song brought about a different series of dance moves as the people in the roped off area moved in a counterclockwise direction. It was really cool to see an older generation teaching the younger one and I can only hope that this tradition goes on forever becaue it is truly beautiful. The men also participate in this dances and with all the different moves and steps, you can be assured that someone has been practicing. Overall, this is was an experience that I will not soon forget. The food booths contained some items that I was willing to try. Plate lunches featuring different chicken and smoked meats, sushi, soups, chili, shishkabobs, brownies, malasadas, banana breads.  Toiday's event will take place in Poipu. They will be lighting the candle baskets and releasing them out to sea as they acknowledge their ancestors. We won't miss that for the world.  But first, we need to return that car. When we got ready to leave Hanapepe, my wife noticed a big bug (I'm pretty sure it was a roach) sitting on her spot. It quickly vanished but my wife was skittish the entire ride back the Pali Ke Kua. I know it's the tropics and there are going to be bugs, but I have to make an effort to please my bride. "
Hello...I was at the Bon dance too...can you tell me more details about the releasing of the lanterns at Poipu tonight?I 100% agree with your description of last night. It actually brough tears to me eyes watching the generations dance together in a traditional setting like that. It was a memory I will always cherish.
"Aloha from Kaua'i!So glad that you got to experience the enchantment of a O-Bon dance here - it is something so special and unique - not something you forget soon - the Hanepepe one is especially nice and I love their food! I have missed so many dances because of my knee surgery (including last nite) - so I'll just have to make up for it next year.About the lantern ceremony tonite - I believe it is at 7pm (I'm not 100% about this) at Kukui'ula Small Boat Harbor off Lawa'i Road - on the road to Spouting Horn. It doesn't have the time on my Bon Dance schedule, so I'm not sure, but as I recall from years past, this was the time.The andagi at the Hanapepe Bon Dance is always fabulous - sorry I missed it (well, I'm not sorry I missed the calories though!).Malama Pono,Janet"
"The word I was was that it is at 7:30 p.m. at the location that Janet described. My understanding is that parking is very limited so we're making plans to get there early and just sit around. I did take a bit of video of several of the dances and I hope to share it with you all as soon as I learn how to post it. The resemblence between this form of dance and the modern day line dancing is uncanny. The dances performed last night, though, are all different in that it's not the same ""line dance"". I hope that makes sense."
"Hitch! What a wonderful report, full on real feeling about the environs. Let us know how the story goes.But that avatar is scary. (Remind me to tell my BIL who lives in SA to watch out for you! LOL)"
"Caddy, actually, I put that mask on to protect me on the forum. Someone mentioned that there was a swine flu epidemic on the forum. "
"For you ""romantics"" out there, here's aink to the legend about the naupaka shrub at the Kilauea.http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/hawaii/naupaka/"
"Aloha from Kaua'i!Naupaka is a beautiful plant - there are several different varieties that grow here and I believe all but one are native to Hawai'i - a real rarity.The beach naupaka is used heavily in beach landscaping - almost every resort property and oceanfront home uses it along their beachside - it is also very important in protecting beach areas from erosion. The white berries from the plant float, which makes the plant spread around the islands. Huehekili is the Hawaiian name for theberries - it translates to ""hailstones""!Have fun!Malama Pono,Janet"
"Hitch.. thanks so much for the info on the Naupaka flower. I bought a pair of ""naupaka"" Niihau shell earrings when we were in Kauai last winter... now i know the story behind the flower. Never realized that before! Thanks a bunch :)"
