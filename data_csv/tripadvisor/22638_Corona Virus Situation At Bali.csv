"Hey guys, my family and I have a scheduled flight to Bali on the 11th of March 2020. I would very much appreciate it if someone could provide some advice or updates of the situation in Bali right now? Do you think it's safe for us to visit Bali? We have around 32 days to our trip and your feedback would allow us to make a decision. Thank you."
"Hi MohamedIt really wouldn’t be responsible for any of us to make knowledgeable comments or predictions as we are only ordinary travellers, just like you, and don’t have access to any more information than you do. In fact, in a month’s time, nobody knows just what the situation is likely to be.. sorry, but this time you’re going to have to make your own decision. We cannot make it for you."
"Absolutely TravelKat, totally agree, however, l will be traveling to Bali in March via Singapore and Singapore is actually the area that really concerns me here. I think l will get a mask to use while in Singapore and on flight to Bali."
Don’t worry Janice. Anything could happen and/or be revealed between now and then.
"Hi Mohammed,you need to get real. “The situation is pretty controlled here”. Is that what the Singapore Authorities told you. Sort of thing you will hear from a “police” state.Singapore has been part of the problem.A British guy who was at a conference in Singapore got infected in Singapore. Who knows how many other people at the conference were infected or the people in the hotels that all the conference members were staying at.The Brit came back to UK then went on to a ski holiday in France where he infected 7 other people including a child. He then flew back to the UK with 168 other passengers. He is now under quarantine but the Govt are trying to track down everybody that he had contact with.In the French ski resort although they are not generally worried they are now trying to track down the children that were in a class with the infected child.This is all over the news and newspapers.So rather than being worried about the situation in Bali you really need to be more worried about the real situation in Singapore."
"The confirmed number of cases in Singapore is increasing daily with I believe 43 cases compared to around 18 cases two or three days ago and it is the country with one of the highest number of cases outside of China. In Indonesia the four confirmed cases are from Indonesians who were in Singapore but escaped to Batam island and currently there is a police chase to find them. Whether of not there are other cases in Indonesia still has not been confirmed by the Indonesian government bu officially it is zero as far as I know.So I think it would only be safe for you to visit Bali if you are certain that you are not bringing the virus to Bali.Edited: 8:22 am, February 10, 2020 "
"As a side note, were you planning to spend 32 days in Bali? Are you aware of the visa implications?"
"About 4 Indonesia persons go to Batam, I must clarify. Indonesia get information from Singapore 4 days, after the 4 persons arrive Batam. When there are positive 2019-nCov patients, so Singapore will trace who are contact with the patient before and some of them is the 4 persons, but the 4 person have gone back to Indonesia in healthy condition, so all of them pass the screening in Singapore and also pass the screening when enter Batam. As WHO protocol they must be quarantine as Indonesian persons from Wuhan and are quarantined in Natuna. So, the 4 persons right now is quarantined in their house for 14 days and have been checked twice a day, morning and afternoon. Until nowadays there are healthy."
They have now identified that the Brit guy was at a conference in the Grand Hyatt in Singapore.Apparently amongst others he infected a guy in the French ski resort who flew back to Spain who now as the virus. The “carrier” is from Brighton. They have now closed a Health/GP surgery in Brighton where an employee has contracted the virus.So going by reports Bali is far safer than Singapore ... and the UK.
I think you got my message wrong. I am only spending 7 days in Bali. What I meant was that I have 32 days before the actual trip.
"Good luck, Mohamed. It's a rare situation and our societies just aren't set up to deal with this quickly. Hopefully it can be contained, in Singapore and elsewhere."
"Yes and enjoy your holiday in Bali, I am sure you will have a wonderful time there."
"I would not be transiting through SIN, BKK or KUL at this time or even into the foreseeable future. As pointed out, there was a conference in Singapore. Infected people were present at the conference. Expect infection rates to rise in Singapore."
I read today that that UK guy who infected his family and multiple others....all tested negative to the virus.
Hi MohammedI am a BalineseEverything is fine in here currently.But its rainy season now...so we will get wet sometimes
Guys check this out. Latest report on a suspected case concerning Bali. What do you think?https:/…
"Singapore is well known for being upfront and its transparency, which also explains why it has one of the highest cases reported outside of China. There will be no covering up. Indonesia on the other hand has refused to acknowledge the potential of Indonesians having contracted the virus. It finds no need to do any tests. Zero tests done so far.I would be more worried travelling to Indonesia than Singapore."
"First positive Corona Virus case involving Bali https:/…Edited: 2:40 am, February 13, 2020 "
"The news regarding virus in Bali made me think twice before we take a final call. By all means, atleast there must be few confirmed cases since many were holidaying during CNY. If sometng happens, geting caught in Bali is going to be very tough.It's better to b safe than sorry is wat I felt and we have deferred our Bali trip for all good reasons. Didn't want to take risk having our little one with us on the trip."
Much agreed. It's sad that things had to happen. Well everything happens for a reason. Now it's my turn to make a decision...
"Regardless, be in your guard even in Singapore. And let’s not put claims like Indonesia does not have the standards to detect viruses or treat them. Come on....."

Singapore was ground zero for spreading coronavirus to the UK (Grand Hyatt conference)There are currently 50 'reported' cases in Singapore. Place with the second highest reported number of cases in the world outside of China (Japan over 200 cases).Please get real.
"I don’t get it Uma. Here you are in Singapore where there have been a number of confirmed infections, yet you are worrying about travelling to Bali where there is ONE unconfirmed infection. Don’t you think perhaps that you would be safer in Bali?"
Who knows what will happen. We leave in 2 weeks. Perth to Tokyo via Singapore. Osaka to Bali via Hong Kong. We are still going. Hubbie bringing home special masks from work that even ammonia doesn't get through. We wear glasses so apparently that helps. Snow googles may be a bit over the top lolHand sanitizer which we always use when travelling. My fear is on the plane not on the ground. We are being careful not paranoid. I am more worried about getting my usual dose of winter bronchitis while snow skiing which has similar symptoms to the virus and getting quarantined for 2 weeks for bronchitis.

"Hi Notapigsty Singapore is paying the price for being a Global city and for being too transparent and truthful. The very reason why Indonesia has opted to pretend it has zero cases. Can you imagine Bali, which depends almost totally on tourism, unlike Singapore, reporting a similar number of cases as Singapore?"
"Hi Travelkat88Because Uma knows that it is impossible for Bali to have zero cases. Singaporeans know how Indonesia functions better than most others. When Singapore says it has 50 cases it means exactly 50 verified cases, nothing more and nothing less. If Indonesia say they have 0 cases, one can add '1' in front and another 3 zeroes behind."
"Hi HerwieNot that Indonesia does not have the ability to conduct tests. They rather not face the truth, having to publicise it, and negatively impact the economy. Their struggling economy matters more than some lives.Edited: 9:56 am, February 13, 2020 "
"Let's be real folks. 5000 passengers a day from China to Bali in Dec, Jan and 5 days in Feb. Then Indonesians travelling to China also. Who are they trying to kid? No-one in their right mind would believe there are no cases in Indonesia. More than likely the testing and screening is not adequate or non-existent. Sick people are probably just staying home rather than going to the doctors. The rest of the world will hear about it when their hospitals and morgues are suddenly overflowing...I think it's in Australias' (and the worlds) best interests to send a medical team there to screen and test and send any results back to Oz to find out the real situation."
"I’m flying via Singapore ina couple of months and have been tracking the response, seems that they are doing a fantastic job to manage the consequences, particularly around incentivising reporting of symptoms and tracking and isolating contacts. There seems to be a consensus forming that there are almost certainly cases in Indonesia but likely undetected or detected and unreported. If that’s the case, there will be consequences for tourists pouring in to Bali and taking no precautions because they think it’s “safe”. Meanwhile Singapore is getting called out for being transparent about numbers, and suffering the consequences in terms of tourism."
"I am here - flew in on 10th and I was the only one that I could see with a mask on my flight besides the welcoming Hostess initially. When I went through the Immigration lines there were only a few people with masks on Chinese and some odd Europeans so and the some of the Government staff. I only wore mine on and off up to the Visa approval then not bothered since - got too hot with it on. Felt silly when no-one else was bothering but do what you need to do for your own peace of mind.So at that time there didn't seem to be a big scare for them BUT YOU DO HAVE TO FILL IN A HEALTH FORM ANSWERING QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY LET YOU IN AND IF YOU HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS ON THEIR LIST YOU ARE FURTHER SCREENED.I did see before I left there were 5000 stranded Chinese tourist who couldn't get back home too,I am in a Villa and not doing too much in the populated precincts but didn't see people with masks on in the streets either when I initially stayed in Kuta.Tourism has been hard hit here as the hotel staff and taxi drivers have been telling us too, so keep an eye on the updates and then come to Bali and overspend. A little of our money goes a long way to feeding families here so be generous.The rupiah is about 90% now so 90,000 for our $10.Come on in the waters fine :) At my Villa anyway.Enjoy your holiday and follow safe health practices as recommended - sanitise your hands and watch the coughers etc."

Is Bali safe to travel to with the Corona virus
"Sandra this question has been asked numerous times on the forum, just scroll down and you'll see plenty of discussions on this topic."
"Are there any restrictions in Indonesia airports for travelers coming from China? Also are there temperature monitoring stations at the airport? Just trying to get a sense of the situation, headed there in about 8 weeks"
"Every persons who has visited Mainland China in the last 14 days will be refused to enter Indonesia, no matter the nationality. There are tensn have been refused to enter Indonesia.In the big airport, you just walk as usual and thermal scanner will monitore you, maybe you are not realize for it. In small airport, they use manual laser thermal temperature and aim at your forehead."
"IMHO it's also not just concerns about getting the virus, but being traced because of someone else that was in your vicinity on a plane or hotel etc. Then you can get quarantined or asked to self isolate, would not be the most convenient of things to deal with I'm sure.Further, is the possibility with a trip that long for something to happen whereby the situation worsens and Bali has an outbreak then all flights in/out get cancelled and you get stuck there in isolation for awhile.Don't think I'd be willing to want to go through that even if I wasn't concerned about being infected."
"Ultimately, this is a question you can only answer yourself.While it is business as usual on Bali (we are living here now!), there is no way to predict if or when COVID-19 will be detected here. As of today, 9 people are being monitored in Bali because they sat next to someone who tested positive for COVID-19 on a flight from KL. However, as we’ve just seen with the new cases in Italy and Iran, no one can predict where in the world it will pop up next, including your home country.At the moment, it's pretty safe to come here and the biggest risk would be on the plane or in the airport, not actually in Bali itself. Nobody here is wearing masks or staying at home or any of the other things that are happening in China / Italy / Iran. I wrote a long post about COVID-19 and other dangers in Bali that will help you decide. And will help you stay healthy if you do decide to come!You can find it here: https:/…Hope this helps, J"
"Thermometers are not very useful in detecting Coronavirus. It's just giving people a false sense of security that you are being active when in actual fact, it's doing nothing. Google it..."
Very true SimeonN but the same applies to virtually anywhere in the world at the moment.
"Actually thermometers are not useful at all for detecting the virus and I'm unaware of anybody claiming that they are. In every country however they are used to identify people who have a high temperature and therefore should be checked further. As your comment is Bali specific, are you suggesting that in doing the same thing the Australian US, UK, EU & Singapore authorities are just doing so to make it look like they are doing something?"
"https:/…Yes I am saying this...Edited: 8:48 am, March 04, 2020 "
"Fair enough - a bit cynical ;-) but you are probably right. They all love waving something around to look active ... or turning up en masse when one person could have done the job. I've got one to check the walls on our brick oven but haven't used it for checking our family temperratures.Edited: 9:02 am, March 04, 2020 "
Why are you picking on Singapore. It's all over the place. The guy probably didn't even know he had it. Geeze.
"Sorry Caroline L but can't see where anybody, at least recently, is specifically picking on Singapore. Reading back on a page or 2 of earlier comments I can see post 31 & 32 from Singapore has a bee in his/her bonnet but that's not unusual for some Singaporeans. Indonesia annoys them and they annoy Indonesia - just a neighbourly thing like OZ and NZ, US & Canada, France & England and so on ;-)Edited: 3:54 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Hi Jat LopezIndonesia does not annoy Singaporeans. I particularly love Bali and thus my frequent visits to this forum. We are just stating facts, however painful the facts would be to some."
I’m curious to know where Sarwa has disappeared to. He/ she often had good information
"No. you don't sound annoyed at all. Bali is a little bit cross however because of all those cases of Covid-19 that Singapore managed to bring into the region - the UK is somewhat miffed also. Then you play goody two shoes and try to say everybody else did the same & must imitate you to solve a problem they don't have. Well, just as with SARs, everybody else didn't do the same. How many cases of SARS did your country manage to bring in from Hong Kong and China in 2003? - 238 infections with 33 deaths as I recall. Meanwhile, your long-suffering neighbours ended up with 2 in Indonesia and 6 in Malaysia. It's all very well to pose about how great Singapore is at cleaning up these messes but it would be far better to not create them in the first place. Business travellers from China who join multi-country meetings and stay seated with their regional colleagues in airconditioned conference and dining rooms the entire week are going to spread whatever their latest virus is among other attendees. Holidaymakers, as in Cambodia, Thailand and Bali, didn't create those kinds of problems in 2003 and it's obvious they haven't done so in 2020 either. Maybe next time the Singapore government could get properly proactive and start banning China mainland business travellers when the outbreak starts. Might as well use that famous authoritarian style to just tell the convention holders and regional company HQs to knock off the meeting until it's over."
Sadly it is slowly coming where Bali is going to be impacted like the rest very soon.
Hi Jat LopezYou surely have an axe to grind with Singapore.Got terminated by some Singapore based employer?
Perhaps Jat Lopez was fined for spitting or smoking in a public arena.
I would feel much safer in Singapore than in Bali right now. Excellent health care. In Bali if you get sick you have to go to the local gov't hospitals which do not have good reputations. I've lived in SE Asia for about 8 years. Currently wondering about flying to Belitung. I think a big thing about Indonesia is we'll never really know how many cases are there.
"A friend of mine is the president of the AMA (Australian Medical Association) in Western Australia. Dr Andrew Miller - he is a practising Anaesthetist and a Lawyer. A very wise guy and I trust implicitly his direction. Google him and read his comments and you will be left in no doubt the real situation.Jat Lopez you are way out of line accusing Singapore of anything. They have 212 cases. The bulk of the spread has always been from China, where it originated. And the disease slowing in China - with 1.4 billion people?? What a load of bollocks. It will still be going crazy there like everywhere else. They have chosen to play it down to try and win back public support from their own people. They are very clever- it seems to be working. But the rest of us don't need to be fools."
"Calla, you may read,227. Re: Bali Corona Virus update?Mar 14, 2020, 10:13 PMAs I said in number 199, There are many stages of test.People want test in the first stage also, but it is not necessary, even in this stage they are not in the isolation room, ... etc"
"Don’t encourage him, Calla. Please!"
"I'm independent and have no vested interest, I'm only give the facts. But maybe you"
"You seem to be as independent Sarwa, in conveniently glossing over the facts as your Government has finally admitted to doing.Your contributions will only add to the demise of Balinese people who rely on tourism as the truth is now coming out after being covered up for so long. Indonesia is unprepared and incapable of handling this pandemic,"
"President Jokowi this morning announced Coronavirus as a National Disaster in Indonesia. Schools in Jakarta and Bandung and probably other areas are being closed for the next two weeks and public parks, stadiums, museums and other places are being closed to try to prevent the spread of the disease.Personally, I worry that poorer people may lose their means of earning an income and this could potentially lead to elevated levels of crime but hopefully nothing like in 1998.Some posters have talked about Indonesia's great ability to handle this crisis, but all I can say is that they are wrong. Indonesia is not at all equipped to handle this.Edited: 11:54 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Surfing WildDo you have a link you can post to President Jokowi's announcement. Been googling but can't find it.We are due to fly into Bali Mon 23rd March but currently debating whether to go or whether we need to postpone for a while.

In Victoria, 13 new cases brought the state total to 49."
No sorry I don't. This information is coming from my wife who is following the situation with her hand phone. I would wait a little longer to see if the news is announced or not as it might just be referring to the WHO urging President Jokowi to make the announcement.
"And personally, I would guess that the true number of cases in Indonesia is well over a thousand. However, the last thing the Indonesian government wants is to create a panic situation."
"I’m seeing lots of fear but not much facts to back it up.I’m here in Bali at the moment and not worried about the coronavirus at all.Actually, I’d much rather be here than in my home country (US) where there have already been a lot more cases and deaths.I may be wrong but I don’t know of any hot/humid country that has had a bad outbreak of this coronavirus.Southeast Asia has an extremely close link to China and this region had detected cases of coronavirus long before Europe and the US, but it never blew up here the way it currently is there.Actually, the virus has been a complete joke in this part of the world. I’m much more worried about car accidents or dengue, which still kills hundreds (thousands?) every year.I’m also worried about the absurd knee jerk reactions from SE Asian countries locking down unnecessarily, like the decision from Cambodia to close after spotting only 7 cases in 2 months (and 0 deaths).I realize some of you think Indonesia is undercounting or covering up coronavirus cases, and that may be true to some extent, but it would be absolutely impossible and absurd to suggest that the virus has been catastrophic here the way it has been in Europe or China. And it would be equally absurd to suggest that every country in Southeast Asia has been doing some masterful coverup of mass casualties from this.Are you guys really trying to say that Singapore has had thousands of cases and deaths like Italy, but they’re hiding it? That is completely insane and paranoid.And what about Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, etc, where the virus has been detected in small quantities for months now but the effects have been undeniably mild?Things could change, but so far the FACT is, the virus has already been here for months and evidently it’s just not capable of doing much damage in this climate."

"Well after Australia now announcing the 14 day mandatory self isolation if coming back from overseas my Bali trip is being postponed. Both hubby's & my bosses would not be happy for us to have to self quarantine requiring further time off work. :( Sorry Bali, but once it's all settled we'll be back :)"
TA2883 - So how many cases of Coronavirus have been confirmed in Bali at this moment? What is the official number?Would you suggest the those with underlying illnesses or over the age of 60 still continue their plans to visit Bali or should they cancel or postpone?
"@SurfingWildThe virus is already present in almost every country. You can’t avoid it by staying home.Actually, it’s been much more severe in Europe than in SE Asia.Unless you think there’s been some kind of coordinated government coverup of thousands of deaths here in SE Asia?That’s pretty insane and paranoid if you actually believe that.Edited: 1:55 am, March 15, 2020 "
You didn't answer my question about the number of confirmed cases in Bali. How many is it?
"No panic anymore, people panic when initial 2 Covid-19 patients are announced, there a rush in the supermarket, mainly in Jakarta. But in this Sunday, however there are no Car Free Day in Jakarta and Surabaya, people are still to the area and do sport, etc., they are not afraid with Covid-19 and said we do sport for healthy. In Bandung, Bandung Zoo is always open when there are Bird Flu in 2007 with visitors only 50 to 100 a day and nowadays when there are Covid-19 visitors are relatively stable as usual Sunday. They believe that Indonesia can handle Covid-19, because Indonesia can handle Bird Flu cases with mortality rate higher than Covid-19. In 2007, Indonesia has 100 hospitals with isolation rooms and nowadays are also used for handle Covid-19, but there are additional, so totally nowadays Indonesia has 132 hospitals with isolation rooms, 4 in Bali."
"@SurfingWildActually the answer is already there, you’re just ignoring it.The important (and more accurately trackable) statistic is deaths. There have been 5 coronavirus deaths in Indonesia (1 in Bali) and 1,400 deaths in Italy. 21 deaths in UK.So yes, you are safer from coronavirus in Indonesia than in Italy. Same goes for the UK, which has had 21 deaths already.Other countries in SE Asia have also had similarly low case numbers and therefore low numbers of deaths.Italy has 1,400 deaths. Indonesia has 5. India has 2. Thailand has 1. Vietnam has 0. Cambodia has 0. Singapore has 0.You would have to be blind not to see the pattern here. The virus doesn’t work in tropical climates."
"Sarwa, do you know how many confirmed cases of Covid-19 there have been in Bali?"
Well that's great then if the Covid-19 virus doesn't work in tropical climates. Thank you so much for the confirmation.
https:/…
We will inform the public eventually. LOL.
"Yes it's sort of important that he has done this, to not publicize the real situation. Even the neighbours of some of the local patients who were released were not happy and didn't believe that they were cured. The Indonesian people, especially those in the Jakarta area, can get very emotional and sometimes take matters into their own hands.At least it's proved the point that so many people have suspected, that there was a cover up."
"For those who didn't read my link in #69 here it is again https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/co…""....- The World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged Indonesia to scale up response mechanisms, including declaring a national emergency...."""
"“At least it's proved the point that so many people have suspected, that there was a cover up.”LOLIt’s been made very clear that Indonesia has had 5 confirmed deaths from coronavirus and about 100 confirmed cases in total. Not a crisis at all, nor is that a cover up.The only thing they didn’t make public is the exact location of the cases, which is pretty understandable, because people like you are struggling to be calm and rational about this stuff.A new report just announced that the latest 19 cases were in Jakarta and 2 in Central Java. Which is not surprising because Jakarta has public transport.Bali has had 1 death from coronavirus and it was a woman with extensive preexisting health conditions. Tragic, but again not panic worthy.Edited: 4:24 am, March 15, 2020 "
"TA2883 the medical staff treating that woman that died weren't even notified she had tested positive whilst she was in isolation at the hospital until after she had died, no cover up ??"
Makes you wonder why they needed a large police presence in Batam for the funeral there suspected to be the Covid virus.Batam also reported to have suspected cases.
"I don’t really trust the Indonesian government either, but for the most part I don’t think that’s what’s going on here.Like I’ve said before, the important (and more accurately trackable) statistic is deaths. Italy has 1,400 coronavirus deaths. UK has 21. South Korea has 75. Indonesia has 5. India has 2. Thailand has 1. Vietnam has 0. Cambodia has 0. Singapore has 0.You would have to be blind not to see the pattern here. The virus doesn’t work well in tropical climates. This is in spite of the fact that the virus came to SE Asia before Europe.It’s not some large scale coverup by every nation in the continent. Good grief, that is ridiculous.Edited: 4:59 am, March 15, 2020 "
"TA2883, you don't need to keep churning out those figures. You can find them at this site like the rest of us:https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6I actually believe that the true figure of confirmed cases of Coronavirus is probably more than 10 times what is being told.If there are indeed only 96 cases or 116 cases as per the official count, it doesn't make sense to shut down schools for 2 weeks, put Solo on partial shutdown and close off parts of Jakarta as well as all museums, sports stadiums and places where large crowds could gather.However, as you are so sure about what you are saying, then I must be wrong."
"I’m sure it’s a comforting hypothesis regarding the possible effects of tropical climates on this virus but, until it’s explored rigorously by qualified scientists, I wouldn’t be getting too excited frankly. Nor would I be too complacent."
"Talking of patterns TA, Indonesia has a mortality rate of 5.2%. Not great numbers in anyones books."
">>>I’m sure it’s a comforting hypothesis regarding the possible effects of tropical climates on this virus<<<Actually I was responding to the UK poster who was telling people to stay in Europe for their own safety.Which is completely laughable. I would rather be ANYWHERE but Europe right now.And it’s not a hypothesis. The mortality figures by region are well known.Edited: 6:43 am, March 15, 2020 "
Which UK poster was telling people to stay in Europe for their own safety?
"I'm not a praying man usually TA, but i pray that you are right. Coronaviruses generally struggle in the tropics, so let's hope that is the case with covid-19. It is to early to make that call however."
"Do tell, TA, are you a scientist? An epidemiologist?"
I wonder why then the reported cases and fatality rate also has nearly doubled in the Philippines in the last 24 hrs.Hence the introduced community quarantine throughout the country from today.Last time I looked Philippines was in the Tropics.
"The Philippines has a whopping 11 deaths from coronavirus after it’s been present there for almost 2 months. Their first case was way back in January.Italy has 1,500 deaths. Even though it’s much further from China and cases just started there recently.Thanks for proving my point."
Who is the UK poster who was telling people to stay in Europe TA? I;ve been looking back through the posts but didn't find any.....?
"@SurfingWildThat was you in post #71 saying people should stay in their home countries for safety. And your location is set at UK.Seems pretty absurd to me, considering ‘home’ for many of us has far more than the 1 death from Coronavirus in Bali.But if you guys want to stay home, then that’s your choice to make. I still feel much safer here in SE Asia than I would in Europe or the US.Australia and New Zealand would seem to be better alternatives too, but I think the virus just arrived there so it’s hard to say how that will play out.All you have to do is look at the total mortality numbers and the amount of time the virus has been in the country. Those are hard to ignore.Edited: 8:07 am, March 15, 2020 "

"@SurfingWildThe answer to your question is that there has been 1 coronavirus death in Bali.Most countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Singapore, still have 0 deaths, even though this region was the first to get it from China.So yes, even if I had preexisting health conditions I would feel as comfortable in Bali as anywhere else.Is the heat thing just a hunch? Sure. But the very low mortality figures in SE Asia do not lie. They are extremely low when you consider the virus has already been here for almost 2 months.For whatever reason, Southeast Asia has not been hit hard by this virus. Dengue still worries me more.And you don’t need to tout your Asia credentials, I’ve been all over this continent and I live here too. :)Edited: 9:39 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Related to number 74,This Sunday night there are match between Persib Bandung and PSS Sleman in Bandung, and the stadium is still full with the soccer fans, but since tomorrow Indosiar TV has announced that Dangdut Music Contest will still on air without any audience or suppoters.I hope Bandung and Bali will be better than Jakarta."
The FCO have just advised against all but essential travel to all of Indonesia.
"TA2883...it's because you keep attacking me as if I have never heard of Asia...give it a break...please!Sarawa, Bandung authorities are stepping up to deal with the coronavirus since the latest death here. Strange that they are allowing football matches to proceed though but hopefully the stadium will not be packed with supporters."
"2 days before the match, the governor suggest, but maybe insist to cancel or do the match without soccer fans, the tickets have been sold out and the match day is Persib Anniversary, so the match is still happen with full of soccer fans with hand sanitizing at the entrance gate. In Bandung, only a few people use mask and also in Bekasi, in Jakarta is also no panicking. People know that possibility to get Covid-19 is less than get Dengeu Fever and Covid-19 is less dangerous than Bird Flu."
"TA - Do you really believe the death figures? From countries like India, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia???The only one I would believe is Singapore. Guaranteed the other countries would not even have the proper testing equipment. So you, like Sarwa need to stop dribbling. You both are pushing understated information. I just hope no-one else reading these posts believes you."
Are you in Australia experience with Dengeu Fever and Bird Flu. Indonesia even experience with SARS and MERS since 2002.
"Hi TA2883Singapore has zero deaths so far because of its excellent healthcare system and its efforts to minimise spread of Covid-19. But can expect some deaths sooner or later.While the rest of the 3rd world South East Asian countries have low death rates, because deaths from Covid-19 would be classified as death from ""Pneumonia"" . They would not even be tested for Covid-19.Edited: 11:45 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"sg6363, you may read it first,227. Re: Bali Corona Virus update?Mar 14, 2020, 10:13 PMAs I said in number 199, There are many stages of test.People want test in the first stage also, but it is not necessary, even in this stage they are not in the isolation room, at the second stage they are in the isolation room, tests will be done, not directly test of Covid-19, but test of corona virus, if negative you will release from the second stage, if positive you will in the 3rd stage and the sample will be tested in Jakarta. Airlangga University in Surabaya can do it also and maybe will test it also soon. If the Covid-19 test is positive, there are the second test and it is called Genome DNA Assay Test to avoid False Positive of Covid-19 test. I do not know the other countries do also Genome DNA Assay Test or not.Usually in the second stage from 8 persons, only one is positive Covid-19 or even from 7 persons no one with positive Covid-19. In the second stage if someone has clinical sight of Covid-19, so without wait for Covid-19 test result can be transferred to third stage.I think South Korea do better than Singapore to handle Covid-19. Cases and death rate is higher than Singapore, but SK certainly bigger than Singapore."
"Sarwa one question, why are they closing the Gillis if there's no real problem in Bali afterall that's where their tourists come from."
"Every area have different vision about Covid-19 and also the leader.When Semarang and Surabaya do not allow a cruise ship to disembark , Bali allow it, after healthy check.More tragic is when the initial/virgin Chinese tourists visit West Sumatra, they are received by Governor, but then people refuse it a day later, because afraid of Covid-19, so the tourists still in the hotels and go back to China.In Manado all Chinese tourists are welcome and in Tomohon, near Manado there are animal market as in Wuhan, but certainly smaller, until nowadays still open. But in East/Central Java all bats are burned. There are tendention that Chinese tourists prefer to visit Manado than Bali, because Manado underwater is better than in Bali, flight to Manado is also cheaper than to Bali.Indonesia has more than 700 tribes and also the languages, so make one policy for all is difficult for Indonesia.There are also Islamic School, Pesantren want exemption to not follow 14 days not go to school, because they are staying in a dormitory."
"Hi SarwaCan you stop posting irrelevant stuff. Your agenda here is pretty clear and it is a lost cause. Regardless of what you say, the Covid-19 situation in Indonesia is in the process of getting out of control. Even Jokowi had to get himself tested."
"Sg6363, Sarwa has made over 150 posts on the Coronavirus since February. He doesn't know when to stop and bombards us with complex and confusing googled information that is often not relevant and doesn't answer the OP's question.He needs to go into self isolation for our protection :)"
"BALI LOCK DOWN *Om SwastiyastuBali Provincial Government Decides:Because of the outbreak of the corona virus, Bali will close all domestic and international flights starting at: * 06.00 wita March 25 2020 to 5 April at 06.00 wita *, and close all shops and businesses ....to be understood for the good of all."
"Post #111, do you have a link for this info at all?"
"@Nodanger Hi, can you share the official announcement about it ?"
"“Do you really believe the death figures? From countries like India, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia???”LOLRight, hundreds (thousands?) of people are dropping dead from coronavirus like in Europe, but every government in SE Asia is covering it up. That’s not a nutty claim at all!You’re the one dribbling. You’re not even in Bali and you have absolutely no clue about anything going on here right now."
Airlines still accepting bookings except for Nyepi day Wednesday 25th March
Post # 111 are you confusing Nyepi Day with this coincidently also occurring on 25th March yes a complete lockdown but only lasting 24 hours.
"Hi,I’ve looked everywhere for any corroboration of the info in #111 and there seems to be none. Cheers"
The best Information I can find re post #111 is via an independent Indonesian journalism Twitter account advising that the Bali Governor has just announced: 1. Suspends schools 2. Working from home for civil servants 3. Avoid crowded place4. Cancel events 5. Form taskforces Timeline: 16-30 MarchThere is a formal media release attached to the tweet.
"Hi,I’ve seen this and the attached official statement and it doesn’t mention the airport. Cheers"
Got it sent to me by someone who I trust and has been in Bali for 30 years I don't have any more than what was sent to me and I posted it on here.
"Same here, Paul. I’ve asked a couple of Australian journalists based in Jakarta and it seems they’ve heard nothing either. Cheers"
"Hi,There are a lot of people here in Bali who say they’ve heard this when you ask them, but there is not a single news source, lokal or national who have such a story, so right now, I think it’s ‘chinese whispers’Cheers"
Bali will eventually go into lock-down once they've exhausted all the band-aid measures. Maybe even in time for Nyepi as Nyepi presents what should be deemed as an unacceptably high risk for spreading the virus due to the masses and their close proximity to one another at the Ogoh Ogoh parades on Nyepi eve.We're about to see if religion trumps common sense.
Confirmation just now of arrangements by a journalist via Twitter. The airport remains open.https:/…
"The link from BB above says:""JUST IN: Bali declared on “alert status” for 2 weeks from Tues, meaning minimising mass gatherings including at tourist sites, locals to stay home, civil servants barred from travel, schools closed. But airport remains OPEN.""If this is correct and locals are indeed forced to stay home for 2 weeks, there goes the parades. While I sympathise with the Hindu locals, common sense wins on this occasion.Edited: 5:56 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Yes it's a partial lockdown although the authorities prefer to call it social distancing, and it basically follows what is happening in other parts of the country."
"A post from Jakarta post 2 hours ago https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.thejakart…Dewa admitted, however, that no specific instructions were forthcoming from the central government to close tourist attractions in Bali.He said that the province's policy was intended only to minimize the number of visitors at a tourist site. The administration had notified the management of all tourist sites to increase vigilance and also instructed all related institutions and agencies to implement good hygiene practices, including routine disinfection.“We will not close tourist destinations,” stressed Dewa.Regarding ongoing tourist arrivals to the island, both overseas and domestic, Dewa said that the provincial administration did not have the authority to close access to Bali.“That is the central government’s jurisdiction. What we can do is tighten the implementation of health protocols at all ports of entry, including airports seaports and fishing harbors,” he said."
"I am bailing on this, not wasting any more of my time. Go at your own peril."

"we are in the same situation, meant to leave in 3 days time.We have redirected our flights for August at a further charge of $75 pp. Still don't know if we will be able to go then or have to rebook once again. It appears that we have lost our money on the accommodation because the cancellation period came prior to the severity of the virus. We plan to hold flights, keep pushing it further out unless it becomes too expensive and will book further at a later date. The other alternative is to take the loss. We had booked 3 rooms (for all famiily) and flight inclusive deal. Padma resort have not replied re refund so I feel we have lost our money.. Just had a friend today sqying he is at the airport trying to get home to Melb. It is chaos and many people are ill, even dropping in the streets."
I woudn't give up on the Padma Resort quite yet. It's difficult to imagine them not agreeing to reschedule.
"oolongT....today is Nyepi, the airport is closed, your friend would not have been allowed to go outside his hotel. Perhaps is talking about another day.Such a shame that your friend did not heed all the advice to get home sooner, as airlines suspending all flights. Jetstar has it's last Melbourne flight tomorrow."
