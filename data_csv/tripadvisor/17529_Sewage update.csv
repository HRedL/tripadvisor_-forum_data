I was chewed to pieces by mosquitos at my favorite spot the coral sands despite wearing bug repellents. Has the problem been fixed since March 2018? Not going back until problem is resolved.
Please let me know
"The Gvt has been fogging constantly - (at one point they were fogging 3 times a day) -so probaby the ""epidemic"" of Culex mosquitoes has diminished (not there so can;t say, but that's what I've read )"
Did read that the sewage overflows have now stopped and the BWA is due to be digging up the roads to facilitate buried sewer line repairs - so should be less standing water (until the rainy season really gets going)
Oh dear what a shame - thought it was better now
"It's late June - we finally got some rain after a dry season, so that tends to jump start mosquito breeding. The mosquitos around here can breed in the tiniest bit of collected rain water, such as a bottle cap or a dry leaf. I have read reports on Facebook from friends who have said recently that the areas of previous sewage leakage on the south coast have been dry when they passed. I think the issue will soon be the construction required to fix the issue - it will cause road closure and delays along the affected stretch of road. There are so many other places to stay on the island - maybe avoid Coral Sands for a while?"
"I am not on the island but the mosquito population all winter was the worst I had every seen and it was due to the graeme hall swamp issues, sewage overflows and a severe case of the culex mosquito. I was very close to coral sands. Even if the overflows have improved or stopped recently I am sure the mosquito population in the area will still be bad outside of the usual seasonal problems. SOOO glad to hear they are working on it and it is improving -- but I hear it is still a problem of sewage release out of graeme hall swamp onto worthing (sandy) beach."
"I can never go back to the mosquitos. I had starting making coral sands a once a year thing. But last time I had hundreds of bites which I had reactions to, this despite wearing repellents. This was in March 2018, it is the end of June and I have scarring on my face and hands from the bugs.What a nightmare, I would like to go back in 2019 but I need to know it will be better."
"Lynn, March this year was actually a bit better than January/February but I know exactly what you mean. Let us hope it is much improved by winter season."
"Lynne, why don't you stay on the west coast instead. I honestly got absolutely no bites during my recent 2 week stay in May, staying in a villa with a lush garden on Sunset Crest in Holetown. I can totally sympathise with you as I seem to be highly attractive to mosquitoes and I do know how they can ruin a vacation, but neither my partner nor me got any bites this trip."
We where in the Hastings area in February and they didn't bother us and I am usually a magnet for them
https:/… sewage update - roads clear - injection wells working = sewage being pumped daily directly into the swamp = business reopening - etc
Has Worthing Beach re-opened?
Barbados is pleased to inform travelers that the final stages of the sewage leak in the South Coast were resolved as of last week. Businesses and beaches in the area are open and excited to host guests!For more information on the resolution of the sewage leak please read here: gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/… Hope you visit in the future!
Great news for the South Coast. Can't wait to come back in May!
