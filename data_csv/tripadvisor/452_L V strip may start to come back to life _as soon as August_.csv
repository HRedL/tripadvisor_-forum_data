"""The Las Vegas Strip may start coming back to life from the coronavirus shutdown as soon as August, according to the resort operator Las Vegas Sands.""https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/las-vega…"
"PB,While I hope that these folk are correct, my feelings is that an opening, that is LV/Stripe-aids, is highly optimistic.If for no other reason, than that a segment of the US Government, wants the shutdown, to reach through Nov, at a minimum, and many into 2021. Quite a few are wanting the Nation to stay closed, through Autumn, just in case there is “a second wave.”We’ll see who gets their way?Best of luck to us all.Hunt"
One can only hope...
People are protesting and it’s only been 45 days since lockdowns began. More than 50% of Americans have no savings. There’s 0 chance the country stays locked down that long. Las Vegas strip is included in that because the entire city depends on it. The mobs would burn the strip to the ground before they’d let it open in November.
"I thought there were a lot of people who were kind of expecting like maybe June for some opening, but this does not support that does it.That's too bad I think. Was hoping something would get moving sooner.Edited: 8:04 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"""If for no other reason, than that a segment of the US Government, wants the shutdown, to reach through Nov, at a minimum, and many into 2021.""I have no idea what this means. Conspiracy theory?"
The article indicates a soft opening in May or June with August being closer to normal. That is how I read it.
It won’t be as we all know it as normal in August. Maybe next year unfortunately.
"Elected officials and bureaucrats all share responsibility to the citizens. They know they need to open to save the people. They know there are 30 million unemployed and 100 million people once you add in the families. How can any politicians or anyone with a conscience or a heart ignore 100 million needy citizens? Just because one is retired or rich or lazy that you can afford not to work and hide at home, that doesn’t give one the right to block the truly needy people to go out to work to buy food, pay rent and bills. Protestors have a right to express their opinions, in the end, they add pressure to the government not to forget those 100 million people. If one is scared and wants to stay home, please do that, you have my support 1000%. You are doing all of us a big favor to reduce the people out there. You at home is good for the community health out there. Let’s open the doors. I’ll be there."

He is talking group business aka conventions. It is the Sands after all.
"Having spent a lot of time looking at data from my local health department and Johns Hopkins University, which has a county by county dataset, the information supports reopening local businesses in areas with few cases, but locking down areas with high numbers of cases. In some cases outbreaks are limited to a few blocks.There is a lot of data available that can quickly point out areas at risk, while allowing low risk businesses to open. Travel, which is central to the strip will be more of a stretch goal. We are going to have to recognize that places may be open or closed depending on the situation on the ground.Locals casinos and restricted licensees are far more likely to be open for business earlier than giant strip casinos."

"""As we test people, we know more and have it, and we're learning that the lethality rate is so much lower than we thought.""-Dr. Deborah Birx, May 3, 2020"
"This view is old hat, but Sisolak has been at least publicly hard-lined regarding the declining incidence of Covid cases for two straight weeks as his benchmark to begin the tip-toe into the end of the resort / casino shutdown. That's the apparent starting point for the Governor to even consider opening a limited number of casino doors, if he's true to his word. Up to this point, he hasn't appeared to waver much from that intent....at least publicly.Once the initial starting point is attained, the very gradual progression representing "" coming back to life"" will be possible. I hope the Sands rep is right about August if not sooner, though he justifiably might be a little presumptuous ( as he probably should be as a business / employee rep) in his statements / wishes. The eventual probability of the Strip climbing back towards normal is appealing to Vegasphiles but, like all the previous pandemic issues, we just don't know until we experience each gradual step into it . More data..more numbers..more argument, unfortunately ( these are important simply because the Gov is focused on them as the key decision issues and he's the call maker).  One possible short-term hitch in the Vegas revitalization process is a potential second wave (respike) of cases occurring after a limited reopening..truth is we don't know if that will or won't happen; there's anecdotal data indicating it might. I truly hope not, as I'm as anxious as the next guy / gal to get done with this ( and all the rest of it..get back to my business,etc)..within the bounds of health safety. I'm all for the speedy and efficient development of an effective vaccine and respect the intent of those who refuse to visit until it's available ( they say the 'end of the year' at the earliest..we don't know that either, but a lot of things have been late in materializing with this pandemic menagerie); I don't see how the Vegas financial situation can endure that 6 - 8 month period of time (at best), other than via perpetual money printing / bailout by the feds. We'll all have to eventually pay that debt back in some form or fashion.. Again, I'd like to see a tiered reopening asap , all under mandated health safety guidelines and reasonable human decision making...if at all possible. We'll see.Time for a beer..."

"Ouch. I think I just sprained my eyeballs, they rolled so hard..."
"Blue.. Great sarcasm.. If not, a very silly post."
Two factors will determine soft or hard openings. Testing/contact tracing and 2nd wave in the Fall/winter. Not difficult to understand.
Well Venetian just cancelled my August concert (already rescheduled from March) to April 2021. So that doesn’t sound very confident for full opening in August...
I'll wait to October
The reopening dates just gets further and further away.

One day historians are going to question this lockdown. More people have suffered devastating financial losses than the death toll that was predicted.
Nah. It probably won’t be in the history books at all.The Deep State corrupt Education Department will see to that.I’m already wearing my tin foil helmet!
As long as it's open for September it's all good!
"""One day historians are going to question this lockdown.""They're going to question the dim bulbs who protested it by jamming together, many without masks, while the death rate continued to climb."

"""They're going to question the dim bulbs who protested it by jamming together, many without masks, while the death rate continued to climb."" - FLWfan1867Plenty of arguments to be made that a better solution would have been to focus on reducing the risk for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions and let the economy remain otherwise open.Not that I'm advocating for what I'm about to type, but: the world would be in a much better place environmentally and financially if this virus was allowed to just run its course. The people it is targeting as far as mortality rate, in general, are the consumers of our planet, whose days of producing have passed. In ages past, our elderly were revered for their knowledge and wisdom, but the internet and Wikipedia has made that obsolete. This virus would be a planetary correction of sorts if it were left to run rampant. Again, I'm not supporting that we let it run wild and kill all our elderly, pre-existing folks and the occasional collateral damage random death such as someone's sibling, child or spouse, but I'm just pointing out that there's multiple views to this and nobody has the right answer. The financial disaster that lockdown has caused could very well end up having longer lasting effects for the majority of the population than anyone could have anticipated.That's totally ignoring the most important part though: what if these lockdowns are all for nothing? What if wave upon wave keeps striking us and a vaccine can't be developed in time, and the same number of people get infected and die than if we would have just let it run rampant from the start? We really don't know how helpful these lockdowns actually are. We may never know."

"If I wanted to advocate for it, I'd happily do so in the post. The anonymity of a random forum on Tripadvisor isn't exactly a place where I'd be afraid to do so."
"But you actually typed that old people are no longer needed because of the internet. That wasn't too wacky, and horrendous, for you to type? Please. This is what you said, ""...but I'm just pointing out that there's multiple views to this and nobody has the right answer.""So I'm guessing you thought to yourself--Well it's not what I believe, but it's just as good an answer because of the cliche, ""nobody has the right answer.""Done with this."
It’s to invalidate the opinions/absolutes of people like yourself who refuse to see multiple sides of an argument.
"""Many more die from the flu each year. Don't call names, sheeple.""When the prime minister of Great Britain ends up in intensive care because of the Coronovirus. I think it's a bit serious than flu.I never heard of doctors and nurses in the frontline dying of flu to such an extent."
"FLW believes that anyone who questions the lockdown is stupid, homicidal and suicidal."
"I question the effectiveness of the lockdown. The only thing that was really locked down was the economy, I can still get groceries, gas, yard work supplies, Amazon deliveries, and a Big Mac. Also, you should look at data rather than an emotional response amplified by an agenda driven media. From the CDC website: The rate of lab confirmed Influenza hospitalizations over the past 10 years shows this year (through 4/25) at 69 per 100K people. Last year was about 64, an average year is about 62. If the lockdown was effective, you expect to see a much lower rate since the lockdown measures should have minimized the spread of Influenza as well. It didn't happen...."
"That is an interesting point, but to be fair, the flu's peak season had already ended by the time the lockdowns started."
"Just like with masks. https:/…85814The research the CDC and WHO did for decades supported my position and the results if this study. Fear is getting the better of people. I mean you have scientists talking about COVID farts potentially being a problem now. This is how ridiculous things have become. And the whole ""trust the experts"" thing. Which ones? The ones who have been wrong for the last 6 months but who the media adore? I can find experts that agree with me, that are right, but those aren't the right experts apparently."
No Big Macs here :-( Donald 's all shut.
"Also look at Sweden's Covid response - voluntary social distancing (they didn't close schools, restaurants, etc) -versus the US response of an economic lockdown. Sweden's positive cases per 1M people is 2247, the US is 3668 per 1M. I think what we got is what we were going to get regardless of the ""shutdown""."
"Since very few of those who believe this is not serious and not much worse then the flu, live in areas that have not been hit hard, and don’t have family working the so called front lines.. Everything looks great from a rural county, or an area not infected by this virus. But having a friend get it, having family working in the hospitals hit hard, I will say you are wrong. The stay at home order, originally 4/15, then May 1 was placed by the WB in WH, so the political drivel saying that this shutdown was/is an attempt to undermine the WB is nonsense.places are reopening in areas less affected, hopefully it works..Nobody wants to run the economy into the ground, no matter how much conspiracies come from experts like Hannity, Rush et al"
"Hunt, isn't ORANGE kool-aid considered cheap wine?"
The article is dated April 23rd. Governor Sisolak has updated his expectations since then. August now seems pessimistic.
"Colby, why are you asking for help from Hunt to try to insult me? Not enough brains to do it yourself?Don't bring forward any facts or relevant information, just an insult? How pathetic."
"David R, since the internet and wikipedia have rendered knowledge and wisdom obsolete we should eliminate all schools and institutions of higher learning. What purpose do they serve? And at what point do we deem our fellow humans expendable? Are stay at home Moms obsolete?"
"Mike J, what part of the message was directed at you? Pump the brakes dude, and try to stay in your lane!"
"With respect to you Q, I do live in an urban area. I live in the densest part of LA. The number of C-19 deaths here is roughly equal to that of Philly. NYC ajd southern NY/ the NJ area is an outlier. We aren't seeing a medical horrorshow but an economic one. It's so dead compared to projections from the experts, the hospitals ships are leaving LA, NY and the Army Corp of Engineers emergency hospital in Seattle is being dismantled. Mitigation just draws this out. Sweden has the same number of deaths as Michigan. Only difference aside from how they are handling the virus is that their economy isn't dying."
"David sez....""Again, I'm not supporting that we let it run wild and kill all our elderly, pre-existing folks and the occasional collateral damage random death such as someone's sibling, child or spouse, but I'm just pointing out that there's multiple views to this and nobody has the right answer. The financial disaster that lockdown has caused could very well end up having longer lasting effects for the majority of the population than anyone could have anticipated.""This suggested form of culling is what happens when the deer population grows out of control. It also reminds me of the aftermaths of WW1,WW2,Korean Conflict, Viet Nam war etc. Different but very similar results. Perhaps we should not offer medical care to those who need to reside in a skilled nursing facility etc. I won't bring up the homeless."

Many deaths are occurring at Nursing homes, the perfect “stay at home” place, they rarely leave their beds, let alone their rooms or facility. Also how are they getting the coronavirus? It is coming in the front door, from those who are asymptomatic, and passing it to them...So to those who insist that the elderly should stay home are just not thinking properly.

"I have numerous friends and family members working at the front line at hospitals in New Jersey. My mother quit her hospital job as a nurse last summer and they were so overwhelmed she was requested to come back, which she gladly did. 6 members of a family that attended a funeral all died of Covid in the town next to me, some were in their 30's. Let that sink in.I totally see the economic impact as well, my entire team is being furloughed in waves at my company. But what people don't seem to grasp is that while THEY might be healthy and feel that they can go about their business, the vulnerable people they interact with day in and day out will then be impacted. I do think that states need to start opening things up slowly and carefully but you can't just swing the doors open and let it be a free for all. To bring this all back to Vegas, I think that the casinos and hotels will be opening in August but it won't be anything like it was last year and it probably will take until 2021 until things return back to a semblance of ""normalcy."""
"“To bring this all back to Vegas, I think that the casinos and hotels will be opening in August but it won't be anything like it was last year and it probably will take until 2021 until things return back to a semblance of ""normalcy.""”In my opinion that would be perfect. I would like to see things open by August as well but a slow progression to normalcy would be optimum. We all love normal but it should not be rushed."
"QdogpaI don't discount your family's account of things in NYC and especially at that location. Again, NYC is an outlier. That isn't the case in most parts of the country. Many deaths are occurring at nursing homes because deaths occur at nursing homes. I doubt there is a nursing home or senior living apartment building in the country that doesn't see an ambulance at least a few times a week on a good week. Please don't take this as an insult to you because it is in no way intended to be, and I'm not including you in this, but it's nice to see people finally care about those in nursing homes. I mean considering how many people dump their parents there. The countless stories over the years of these poor people being beaten, sexually assaulted, having their property stolen, not getting proper meals or medical care. Funny how suddenly these people matter so much. All this is is transference. Adults trying to shift the blame for why they must stay home and must wear a mask onto someone else. ""You wear a mask not to protect yourself but someone else"" is the same garbage. These people could careless about everyone else. They are scared bleepless about the virus because they think they'll die. Over half the people in nursing homes are 85 years old or over. The average life expectancy in the US is, rounded up, 79. Of course if something, even a cold gets spread around a nursing home people have a higher chance of death. So what are we going to do, lock down the country every flu season? Over 90% of deaths from the flu occur in those over 65 after all. Or perhaps have staff live on site? I mean that might mean that costs will go up to ditch grandma and grandpa, maybe the extra cost can go towards better background checks? I've put my money where my mucous membranes are. I'm not preaching one thing and living another. Getting my test this weekend, finally. My wife is getting hers on the 16th as her company is comping hers. Even if I have zero antibodies, I'd change nothing."
"Most young to middle age people who do get sick from Covid 19 do not die but their lungs will be scarred for life. This means when they do get old breathing will be an issue. Covid 19 does not have to kill you to make your life miserable later. And yes,, hopefully Vegas will be open by August and then closed down by November due to the 2nd wave. So there will be roughly a 2 month period to get your freak on."
"Pns, respectfully disagree..deaths do occur at nursing homes , but not anywhere near the % that is occurring in 6 weeks....some posters here insist that those who are most susceptible , stay home..but they are! And dying ....Lecc, agree with you..."
"We are probably in the 2nd wave since this virus has clearly been here since at least November. Smog has probably taken 10 years off of everyone's life. So has booze, fatty foods, etc. At some point you have to take a long hard look at things and say to yourself, are you really enjoying life? Better to die at 70 and enjoy those years than live to 80 and hate the majority of them. I want to live, badly btw. I've said it many times, the last thing alive on this planet won't be the cockroaches or the tardigrades, it will be me. If you think I'm kidding...."

Don't necessarily agree with your plan on the virus, but I know that you have the best interest of people at heart.Oh and if anyone you know of does have the virus badly, my wife mentioned to me a coworker whose family member was deathly ill from it was given Remdesivir and is now back home feeling much better.Edited: 4:55 pm, May 05, 2020 "

And re the virus, there are people in their 90's and 100's who have survived it while people in their 20's haven't. Nothing is certain, that is both a blessing and a curse.

There's been a bit too much PDA type posts here lately. Let's see your true colors again.
Plenty of ghost towns in NV. The future of the Strip is still undetermined.
"Bird... Nope.. Never in my wildest dreams would I HOPE for a 2nd wave. Not sure what gave you that idea. But it has been mentioned by a few experts. Well, Most experts. I think it had something to do with the Spanish Flu and how the 2nd wave wiped out millions."
"Bear in mind, with regards to the second wave of Spanish Flu, WW1 had a significant part to play in that. You had a massive number of troop movements around the world coupled with the fact that hygiene, battlefield health and just a low standard of medical care compared to today made it as bad as it was. It was also a far far worse strain of coronavirus than COVID-19. Plus, they didn't have Pastor Ken Copeland blowing the wind of God on the virus to keep it bay like we do know. Better send in those checks guys! He needs a Gulfstream 700 or we are all screwed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2s0nB2VPvs"
"I think that this corona will not end in August. We all hope it will, but there are very much probabilities that it will end at the end of the year if we will have a second wave of the virus..."
"“ More than 50% of Americans have no savings.” - Can you imagine that this is the reason everyone that’s freaking out is freaking out. They’ve worked, well most have, and still have no money saved. It amazes me. That’s why this situation will last a while too and I’ll just be chilling at home with minimal worries because we have been responsible and saved. We’re not rich, not even close, but looks like we could be considered that these days. 13"
"August is about right.For thousands of years in Asia, numerous pandemics disappeared mid to late Spring, judging by Coronavirus reports from the Far East, that is exactly what has happened. Most Far East countries reported zero or very few local Covid19 cases in the last 3 weeks. It is gone. Amazingly accurate. SARS also disappeared in April and May 2003. US and Europe are about 2 months behind in Coronavirus, it mostly cleared in Far East by May 1st, that’ll be about July 1st or 4th of July for us in the US. Give or take few weeks."
"Not everyone is in the sane financial situation , makes the same salary , has been dealt the same hand in life, is old enough to have had the time to, or lives in a state where the cost of living is more conducive to the ability to build a substantial nest egg . Move to NYC with that TX salary and see how easy it is to save."
"Or move to Las Vegas. One of my LV properties is a 4 bedrooms 3 bath, living room, huge family room, fireplaces brand new kitchen, gardens and full size pool, rent is $1850. I can’t get more than that. What do you get for $1850 in San Francisco or New York? My guess same low housing cost in 47 states."
"Wonderful to know that many people will not take the vaccine, the biggest worry is how to make enough vaccines for the world population. Less competition is good for my vaccine. Shoot me up."
"Anthony Curtis predicts June 1. This may be old news but it is a happy read, maybe, perhaps.https:/…"
yes it's an interesting read BUT no mention that the speculations were based upon Covid-19 data.
Blue #16 - I certainly hope your trip happens as ours is booked for Sept. 4-9. Had to cancel the April 29-May 5 trip. Let's hope things take a sudden turn for the better with the summer heat.
"“ Move to NYC with that TX salary and see how easy it is to save.” - This is such a ridiculous argument. You know why? Because your statement also implies New Yorkers make more in salary, which helps my point. If you’ve made more salary, shouldn’t you be able to save? It’s laughable. Besides, no one is making you live in NY. What an ignorant statement. Yes, Texas is affordable. I have a huge house and land, I’m not living like a sardine and paying more for it. Who in their right mind would live like that? That’s a facetious question. 13"
“ Move to NYC with that TX salary and see how easy it is to save.”If you were smarter and had a better job you would make more in salary and be able to afford to save.
