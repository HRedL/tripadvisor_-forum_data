"How’s the tourism at this point with corona spreading (and recently a couple diagnosed , though in Maui and Oahu)? We have our flights in April (direct from SFO to Big island), but worrying as Hawaii may not be scrutinized and people from China may be visiting there?"
Or from any other place. Check your assumptions. You think SF is any safer bwahaha?Stay home. Then if you get sick you can second guess that. Might not have gotten sneezed on at Ralphs.
"No flights from China have come into Hawaii for the last couple of weeks. There are like 3 different thread, although on other island forums but the info is the same. We don't know anymore than anyone else in the US does!! Currently there are no diagnosed cases of the virus in Hawaii. There is some nasty flu going around though. Hawaii not being scrutinized? Your kidding right?"
"Wow....maybe you need to read more and better news. You have a much higher risk at home than ANYWHERE in Hawaii.You have a number of active cases in California--plus all the people being quarantined (when they aren't released by mistake). Hawaii has no active cases and never has. I'm sure that will change in time, but I'd still rather be here than there!"
"Thank you for the responses. Though it would have been much better if they didn’t come with sarcasm or finger pointing as I was genuinely asking. Honolulu airport has now been added to screen passengers, SFO always had. But as far as I read, BI isn’t, hence the question. Thank you anyway."
"HNL was one of the original airports to screen passengers. Trump listed us at the same time as SFO etc.But since we have no flights from China, the thought back then was we would be a secondary screening point.Now that the virus has spread to Japan, that's a little different......but not for HNL procedures."
"OP your question was offensive in singling out people from China now that many countries have it and wondering if KOA was up to it. It is an international airport in the US.Edited: 2:27 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"Patty reasonable questionwe have 3 trips planned this year starting in AprilNew York/Cape Cod , Maui and the BI unless something changes, we are going as plannedHope you come come back and ask any questions of the BI good luck"
"Thank you John and Akamai. Sorry I did not mean to offend anyone. I was not singling out anyone, several airlines to China have being suspended and I was only following along those lines. Agree it’s spread now and also in our neck of the woods. But considering the epicenter was in one country, I thought it was reasonable to ask. Surely disappointed for the first time at TA. I posted As a concerned parent, and was really looking for genuine responses from people contemplating and in similar situation. And I thank everyone who did."
"For what it's worth, I have received notices about my upcoming flights from the airline that no passengers who have visited mainland China in the last 14 days will be allowed to board. This flight will originate in Papeete and land in SFO. So it's pretty universal, seems to me."
"The reason for that is that since a person would be turned back at SFO, the airlines don't want to be stuck with them....as they would be if they let them board to start with.Edited: 10:31 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"Yes, people are flying even now.Hawaii has no confirmed cases.California has 8."
"I am flying out from Vancouver tomorrow. I flew from Vancouver to LAS vegas a couple weeks ago. I always worry about getting sick being on a plane confined with others and this is no different for me. I wipe down my tray table, seat belt and arm rests and use lots of hand sanitizer and put 'thieves oil' under my nose. Extreme? maybe but it makes me feel better. Will I cancel? Nope. Theres always something to worry about when you travel if you let it. For the first time I had to answer the question if I or anyone in my family had recently been in China when I checked in tonight online. There were lots of people with masks on in the airport and plane on my Vegas trip and I doubt it will be any different tomorrow. Suits me fine."
"Thank you Kimberly and travelling55. Sometimes life makes us paranoid with excess information on news/media. And as you said, there’s always a risk, this or that.Will keep an eye on how things move in the next month or so. Fly safe all!"
I would think that airports around the world will be checking passengers prior to boarding and on arrival. The world cannot be too complacent about this virus so it would be prudent for all airports to employ stringent tests.

"We left Hawaii via Kona Airport on Thursday. No 'screening' at Airport either way. Tourism is shut down; Volcano park is closed; expensive takeout food only. Our condo complex shutdown the pool and chained up beach chairs. All tours are closed. Not much to do - we were on last Delta flight out of Kona. We will wait until next year before returning. JMHO.Edited: 2:58 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"The China question or concern is a moot point. Stay at home order lasts thru April 30 and the 14 day quarantine rule for non residents of Hawaii is at this point indefinite. So if you land in April best case you get to go hang out at your hotel room for 14 days. So basically what William said. If you land there's almost nothing for a tourist to do.Also, any one on a plane at this point could be a carrier of the virus & all you have to do to contract the virus is touch something they have touched. You don't even have to be sitting next to them."

"Patty,Now that the US is a leader in the spread of the disease; are you concerned that people from the US might be there?Especially Cali!"
Patty hasn’t been on here since the middle of February. I’m sure she’s with the rest of us who cancelled our trips.
"I had asked this in mid-Feb.. yup, I’ve cancelled my trip already! Sigh! Hopefully can visit this beautiful island sometime in future."
