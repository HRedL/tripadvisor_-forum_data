Trip is in 2 weeks and still trying to decide if I should go or not due to the Coronavirus. Today there are 128 confirmed cases in the Netherlands. Are people in a panic there and is it safe?? We are both healthy in our late 30’s and 40’s.
"just go, no reason to panic, i have my trip scheduled for april and I will go for sureEdited: 2:53 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Yes there is a big panic... Riots, people pillaging...Ofcourse there is no panic or anything when 0.0007% of the population is infected and 0.0000005% has died of it (assuming 17000000 inhabitants).Whether you want to travel is a decision only you can make, maybe even cobsult with a medical professional before you do should you believe you're in a high risk group.But the final choice is yours and yours alone. Not something strangers on a forum can and should advise about."
You won’t notice anything if you don’t turn on the news.
"I have family and friends that live in California and with the cases they have there, people are buying food, water, and toilet paper up. I posted this to see if I would get replies from people that actually live in Amsterdam and see what the situation is like, whether people are just living their normals lives. Thank you for your response and I know it’s my decision to make not strangers from a forum. Lol"
"I live in California and no one is panic buying here. Stores are stocked and no one is freaking out.Take the trip.Edited: 4:03 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Yes it is just a normal day at Costco for most Americans!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUcn-3CQ-4oAt least their stock will go up !https:/…costco-earnings-coronavirus-1.5488304Edited: 1:53 am, March 07, 2020 "
">> I posted this to see if I would get replies from people that actually live in Amsterdam and see what the situation is like, whether people are just living their normals lives. <<To make it relevant to the query, yes people will live normally and work until it is possible. However, the risk is absolutely very high of infections spreading very easily in the NL. It has done so in many other settings, such as in S Korea and in Italy.NL is a country where people are extremely mobile daily, commuting all over the country and interacting much in various settings. So even if a bunch of cases were initially in one remote location, the multiplication factor is alarming.Since there is no way to identify people who will infect, because they do it before they fall sick the situation is much worse.So you can't get blinded and have hunches on the issue as some prominent world leaders are having. Or Elon Musk is tweeting.Or point to a statistics of x% and probability of y%.Instead, one has to be rational and consider the risks carefully.Just see what happened on the cruise ship in California. One fellow from previous cruise got tested positive in Mexico, and now several dozens are confirmed infected in the next voyage.So, I am not asking you or others to panic, but to be aware that this crisis is not just to be pretending that it does not exist. Be aware and take better decisions!"
"What's somewhat problematic is that the key for not spreading this on is largely in the hands of those who are barely at risk. Given your age and good health the risk for you personally is minimal, however from a broader societal perspective you should probably refrain from travel. When the outbreak in Italy was still relatively small people in the Netherlands had a week of school holiday and thousands went skiing in Italy. In retrospect now we can see that many got infected there and then spread it further when they came back home."
"Apparently scientists have identified a new strain of this virus called H15-Steria. It is far more widespread than the COVID-19 strain and causes people to lose all grip on reality and perspective and causes them to panic buy toilet roll for some reason. Some people have even been known to buy rolls of kitchen paper and cut them in half as an emergency supply. Victims of this strain also seem to be confusing this virus with dysentery hence the panic toilet roll buying thing. Very worrying. H15-Steria also seems to prevent people from leaving their homes except to go to Costco for toilet rolls. Also makes them think they should ditch the thousands they have spent on trips.Sounds like you might be already infected with H15-Steria so go to your nearest rational friend, wearing a useless face mask of course, and have them talk sense into you."
"I am stealing this, Ron :)"
"Leaving in two weeks time. Monitoring this kungfu bug and I still think it is safe. Netherlands has 128 cases and one death as of today. USA has 355 cases and 17 deaths. Given that our country's testing per million population is a dismal 1 (korea test 2300/million) we could have walking coronas among us.If we take the given that the death rate is 2.5% (2-3.6 range), our 17 deaths should translate to 680 cases. So really, we are not much safer here."
I am more concerned about quarintine in Amsterdam or not being able to get back to the US. thoughts???
Tomorrow? NoNext week? Very unlikely.In 2 or more weeks? No one can tell you.
"Sorry for hijacking this conversation, but is there a website or a news outlet that would be good source for finding information on quarantines and possible event cancellations? We'd have a concert in AFAS Live in a couple of weeks. Some other countries have ordered cancellations already. (Not stressing about the virus particularly here.) Thank you! And great to hear the locals aren't panicking."
"The website of the RIVM (= the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) is the official source for information about general measures, quarantine etchttps://www.rivm.nl/enThe websites of individual venues such as Afas Live, will inform you about cancellations."
"Thank you Breda_Travelgirl for the official link, I'm sure it's helpful for others as well! (We're already following AFAS Live on social media and reading their website.)Edited: 1:46 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Debny, I'm not worried about the quarantine in Ams. I am more worried about the security at Schiphol as RIVM yet to put up their further actions/measures to be taken. Imagine if they do not do a thorough check before departing Ams, chances the whole plan will end up being quarantined when it touches your homecountry. Guess you might have read these happenings.. on cruise ships etc."
"Everyone was very helpful with all the insight with what’s going on over there, I thank you all.. I been paying close attention to the website for updates on travel and infections. Looks like I may be going solo now because my partner decided he doesn’t want to go . Lol Now my question is, is Amsterdam a safe city for solo female traveler looking to celebrate a big milestone birthday?? Hahaha.."
"Yes, perfectly safe!"
"This is simple and easy to answer. Amsterdam is a safe city for solo women living or travelling. You can enjoy your time.General festivities may be muted a bit, depending on how things evolve in the next few days."
"I personally would avoid big crowds. Just as a precaution. Especially stationary crowds (as in a theater, concert, etc.) But I am still going. Flight is next week!"
"So you're going to avoid crowds, but you're going on a flight. How does that work, you have a private jet?"
"“ I personally would avoid big crowds. Just as a precaution. Especially stationary crowds (as in a theater, concert, etc.)”As in a plane?"
Or an airport. Or a hotel lobby...
"From my local news: ""The Minnesota Department of Health announced Sunday that the second PRESUMPTIVE case of COVID-19 was found in a Carver County resident. The patient is in their 50s and was ""likely"" exposed to the novel coronavirus while in Amsterdam in late February."" As a Carver County resident in my 50's and a yearly visitor to Amsterdam, I can emphatically state.. It isn't me!  (""presumptive"" capitalized by me, the quotation marks around ""likely"" was part of the original story)"
"Hi let me explain.1. I trust boots on the ground. If locals say its ok, who is the CDC to say. If locals say no, I am prepared to loose the money.2. Only way to avoid crowds is to be a hermit at the Carpathian mountains. But then I have to fly to get there:-))3. I would limit my exposure to static crowds if possible. That is what I mean. I have no choice with a plane. I would avoid staying in the hotel lobby. And I am happy that in restrospect I booked a train ride from Berlin to AMS with a stopover.  A casualty now is Casa Rosso. I just cancelled it- off my itinerary now. But I fret not. It means a reason- to go back!  Incidentally, in Berlin, I was gonna take all my dinner at the Berlin HBF ( live near there). Not anymore. Will go to more quiet places. Get the food and get out.  And stay at least 6-8 feet from crowds, if possible :-)) It is just part of preemptive action. Like hand sanitizers, and hand washing."
"“ I would limit my exposure to static crowds if possible. That is what I mean. I have no choice with a plane. I would avoid staying in the hotel lobby.”The point is that the Anne Frank house, the Van Gogh museum and the Rijksmuseum will be much more crowded than a hotel lobby. So I don’t understand why you don’t want to stay in a hotel lobby, but have no problems with going to these museums. You will definitely not be able to be more 6-8 feet than from crowds in these museums. It will be more like 2 or 3 feet, or even less in the Anne Frank house.Edited: 12:00 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Hi BTG, if I see it crowded, up goes the mask :-)) I really cannot live without the museums. But if it is too crazy, then I will just not go. I heard Anne Franks is the worse of the 3.B4 anyone says anything about mask, I know the recommendation. I won't wear it while walking the streets. It's situation specific. Much like where I work in my hospital.Still- AMS here I come!"
But masks are useless.In a hospital (where masks are used most) they are discarded after every single contact with a patient. And that's for a reason. Apart from that oblnly the FFP4 masks are effective. But only when changed after every interaction with a person. (and don't even get me started on the countless people at airports I saw wearing masks but keeping their nose out of the mask...)Apart from that the virus doesn't only infect through the mouth and nose but is suspected to spread through the eyes too: https:/…transmission.html
Masks are quite effective but not in the way you might think; they prevent you from touching your mouth and nose with your fingers. They don't help much against other ways of contamination though.
"Coronavirus containment measures are now getting very serious! Our prime minister has just announced that from 7:15pm tonight there will be no more shaking hands in the Netherlands! Other current emergency measures remain in force: wash your hands much more frequently than normal, sneeze into your elbow and use paper tissues and not cloth handkerchiefs. Welcome to the Netherlands. We keep it simple so you don't have to worry.Edited: 2:32 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"And in addition to the new “no hand shake policy” people that live in Noord-Brabant are asked to work from home if possible. Our province has the most cases, so I get where this is coming from. Guess I’ll work from home the next few days!"
Re: no hand shaking.I was going to make a comment earlier about this impossibility.https://tinyurl.com/vkm8f9l
"hilarious.compare it to countries that are worried. Costa Rica had the first case yesterday and they are taking measures already.https://ticotimes.net/2020/03/09/costa-rica-…Edited: 5:29 pm, March 09, 2020 "
of course people will keep joking about it for some more time. especially on our favorite blog here it is still a matter for sarcasm and humor!https:/…coronavirus-news.htmlhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-marke…
Thank you for your post. My son is going to Amsterdam this Thursday and staying in Central Amsterdam. Just curious about the atmosphere. Is everything still operating as usual?
yes. everything is nearly normal. it should stay normal for some more time. there are some signs that virus may have peaked in China but in Europe its still early days. some basic caution is necessary at the moment. no one can guarantee it would remain this way but keep fingers crossed.
"""Is everything still operating as usual?""Yes, yes, yes and again yes. Except no shaking hands!"
Yes.. mask are useful if we keep thrashing it every 30mins. Boy where can find so much mask at this point of time. All swept out clean. If you still have you are one lucky fella. Just a quick update. I might be cancelling my trip to Ams. My last wait and see today.
"@41: no masks are not useful, only in the way ASW stated. The obly masks which are a tiny little bit useful are the n95 masks (or ffp4). But for the common folk they are not useful. Medical specialists who work on quarantaine departments actually go through regular training and on how to use it. And even they suffer wearing them for long times."
Another useful advice (something to smile)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjU5-hlOqdQ
"Every day around 2 PM the RIVM releases new figures. There are 61 new confirmed cases, 44 of these new cases are in the province of Noord-Brabant. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in The Netherlands to 382."

We are leaving tomorrow evening barring significant news. I am a healthy mid-50s traveling with a younger adult. We are just planning on a lot of handwashing and doorknob wiping at this point. Hopefully we will still be able to see the major sites. And I’m prepared to come home early if that is what is necessarily.
Hi My 22 year old son is leaving Thursday with two friends for Spring break. We went back and forth on whether to cancel. They still want to go. I’m a little concerned but it seems like things are holding study. I hope!
"The new figures have been released. 121 new cases are reported, which brings the total to 503. This sharp increase in new cases is partly due to the fact that a lot of hospital workers in the province of Noord-Brabant have been tested in the last couple of days. With 223 cases, the province of Noord-Brabant in the south of the Netherlands still has the most cases. Followed by the province of Utrecht with 66 cases. The city of Amsterdam currently has 8 confirmed cases."
Cancelled our paris and Amsterdam trip. Sad but not regretted. Will come back next year. Wish everyone healthy!
"To all who are still going on with your trip, wish you the best. I have cancelled my trip and postponed it to a later date. Not regretting and still look fwd to beautiful amsterdam by year end. Hope the virus will be cleared off by then. Take care all ye people in the NL. Will keep you peeps in prayers. Cheers!"
"I have cancelled my trip as well to Amsterdam, Beglium and Paris near middle of April. Too much uncertainty and the risk of ""what if something happens"" is not worth it. I am definitely sad to have pulled the plug on this trip as I had prepped and planned for a while. i hope to back maybe on early fall. :( Belgium Airbnb host will not refund my money though....does not think Covid-19 is a good enough reason to cancel so that sucks."
"I am also from Canada. Was planning to go to Amsterdam and Scandinavia. Will also have to cancel as well. My Airbnbs in Scandinavia are actually cancellable, but my hotel in Amsterdam is not.Hopefully things will be under control in the fall and I can travel again."
"Travelmonkey, you made a good choice. Sorry to hear about the non refund for your airbnb accomodation. I myself did not get s refund either. Plus i gotta play for my flight penalty for rescheduling. Though it all cost lotsa monies and of our time of course, prepping and looking fwd to the trip, well.. we all have one live. Love yours. Amsterdam is not gonna disappear. We all made the right choice."
Has anyone decided to travel? Im due to fly to Amsterdam on Monday with my partner from Dublin. He's relaxed about it but im on 2 different minds whether to go or not!
"The new figures for March 12 have been released. 111 new cases are reported, which brings the total to 614. Of these 614, 102 are health workers.The number of cases in Amsterdam has increased from 8 to 11 confirmed cases.Source; National Institute for Public Health and the Environment https://www.rivm.nl/enEdited: 9:28 am, March 12, 2020 "
I was due to travel to Amsterdam on Saturday for 3 nights but have just cancelled. Personally I don’t feel right about leaving the country for a leisure trip. The hotel (the Renaissance) have refunded 50% of what we paid so that is something. I have made a refund claim to Aer Lingus and will see what happens there. Hopefully I will make the trip when everything settles
"Due to fly over on Sunday from Dublin, I'm pretty relaxed about the situation and want to go. But if nothing is going to be open or if our experience won't be the same we are considering cancelling. We won't be refunded for flights as they as still on schedule and I have yet to check with our hotel as to whether we will be refunded or not"
We are due to fly Sunday too. Really still want to go - it's my 50th birthday on Monday. But have just seen that all the museums are closed and I'm wondering about the shops and restaurants. I'm also a bit wary of getting stuck if our return flight gets cancelled. Really don't know what to do!
"“ I'm wondering about the shops and restaurants”Most shops and restaurants will remain open, just like most cafes and bars."
if it wasn't for that flying in and out issue this actually would be a good time to go. less crowded. im sure not every hotel in the city is going to shut down. perhaps get a bargain rate. there will always be a place to get a beer and food.
We are schedule to fly mid April and are still planning on going. If my carrier changes the schedule and is able to re-accomodate us via alternate routing we will still go. We've been to the museums on previous trips so not doing the 'big' ones - only one small one (Pianolo Museum). We always enjoy Amsterdam no matter what and exploring the other cities.Whether or not one travels is a personal decision and only you can make it.
Will you need to self-quarantine on return to the US since you’ve traveled to continental Europe?
From what I have read...IF we showed symptoms then we would self quarantine . But every thing I have heard or read does not say we must. Obviously if we had symptoms we would.The only country that requires a mandated 14 day self quarantine is Israel ( but that could change) .
"As of now, CDC put a level 3 travel warning on Europe and...""Travelers returning from the specified countries in Europe must stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing."" -from cdc.gov-"
"Just to note Russia and Poland are closing borders today. Poland is closing restaurant, cafes, pubs and some shops personally I think people that can get refunds in any travel situation between the states and Europe or within Europe should try defer, refund or cancel. These restrictions and announcements are increasing daily."
"Hi, at this point it is no fun coming to the Netherlands . We are not in panic, but all museums and big attraction parts are closed until March 31. New measures are taken by the government on a daily basis, our social life has almost abruptly come to a stop.If I where you, I would postpone the trip to a later date."
"KLM is still under the impression that I should fly from Japan tomorrow for 23 days in the Netherlands by not giving me a refund on my ticket. I am eligible for a refund on my other KLM flight from Amsterdam to Boston which would have been about 12 days of the 23-day trip but that’s not official yet either. Flying Blue agents were very kind to talk to but couldn’t do anything. Then they gave me a phone number in the USA to call. I waited 2 minutes and an agent came on!? I was about to make breakfast assuming it was going to be another 1 or 2 hour wait like it was for Flying Blue’s Japan number. Again, a very nice agent but then he told me that for my ticket from Amsterdam to Boston that’s officially cancelled, I need to call the telephone number in The Netherlands because he can’t issue a refund for my ticket. So, from Japan, I need to call Amsterdam after the nice man in Tokyo gave me the telephone number in the USA. Next, for my ticket from Osaka to Amsterdam, this friendly agent said I had to call Tokyo KLM because the Amsterdam KLM won’t be able to do anything but I’ve already called that office in Tokyo and they couldn’t help me either. It’s actually becoming more comical than annoying at this point. My back up plan for the extra 12 days in the middle would have been to see my family in Poland. Now that isn’t a possibility. I got a message on Friday evening from KLM saying they are sorry that my flight from Amsterdam to Boston was cancelled on next Friday and to show me how sorry they were, they offered to treat me to a free meal if I was currently in the airport in Amsterdam waiting for my cancelled flight... in 7 days!? Uhhhh... yes. I’m there 7 days early for a flight that doesn’t exist anymore. And I already get decent enough food in the new-ish Flying Blue lounge anyway as well as a shower if need be so I’m pretty sure a token sandwich from the food courts in the terminal wouldn’t really be better than the free champagne and food in the lounge. :)But I’m still in Japan so it doesn’t really matter. Now... do I call across the world again to Amsterdam or do I call across the country to Tokyo to see if I can resolve this? Decisions decisions"
Interesting info on stages of Virus and spreading... One can disregard country .. but info applies to virus in common..Might give reason to self quarantine and avoid situation faced in China/ Italyhttps:/…74621197.cms
Hi fellow American! I am supposed to be going to Amsterdam April 15th. My family wants to reschedule but our air bnb has not gotten back to me about doing so. Are you concerned about being rerouted to an airport for screening and being stranded? Or having to self quarantine for 14 days?
I think you should reschedule regardless of whether your airbnb gets back to you. Why would you let your choice depend on that? You could wait doing so for a couple of weeks to see what happens but this situation isn't going to just disappear anywhere soon.
"We, too, are flying out 15 April. Our flights were changed to/ from...same dates but different connecting hub. Our hotel,Marriott, has modified their cancellation policy. We are not worried...we are thinking that with the current restrictions it will be better in 30 days.In any case it is a personal decision. Good luck"
If Airbnb does not refund us the full amount rescheduling could be a financial hardship and we might not go all together. That’s why we are waiting to see how the situation changes
"We too had to cancel our early April trip to Brussels and Amsterdam. At first we were concerned about risk of being quarantined/stranded. But as the situation changes, we felt like we had to take that hard step of canceling so we won't take part in spreading the virus. We ended up starting the cancellations yesterday :("
"We are due to fly with BA tomorrow on a package to Amsterdam staying at the Renaissance Amsterdam. I’ve spent collectively over 8 hours on hold to BA trying to get advice. I got through once and was told I could only get my airport tax back but would lose everything else. Advised to hold out to see what happens. We are due to fly at 7.45am tomorrow but have decided not to go so looks like we will lose all our money apart from a small token refund only if we can get back through to BA to cancel.Edited: 5:28 pm, March 14, 2020 "
We were due to fly today too. We cancelled yesterday on their website and requested a travel voucher. We won't get a refund on the hotel but will get a voucher towards a flight which is valid for 12 months. I gave up trying to speak to someone but it seemed quite straightforward on their website. Gutted as we were going for my 50th birthday but felt it wasn't worth the risk of getting stranded.
