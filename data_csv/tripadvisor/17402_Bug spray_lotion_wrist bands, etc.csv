After this few days of rain the mosquitos have gone wild and crazy!Make sure you bring a product that fits your needs and dont fall into the rush of buyin here!Just sayin!!!
That is no joke. They are hungry. Stopped to take pics up by El Coz and wtched them swarm out of a puddle. Fogged up the vw bug with deep woods off ASAP and that helped a bit. We even got bit at Prima 9 floors up and windy. Been to Coz 5 times and this is the only time I have even thought about using repelent.
"Wow! Went through the monsoon this week, and never even saw one. No bites this year! Woo-Hoo!!"
No bites while the torrential rain was pouring. Made a mistake walking from Playa Azul to Buccano's via street sidewalk on Friday night. 6 bites despite dousing myself with repellent before heading out the door! I kept spraying while walking too. Learned it was much faster going via the beach.
"The mosquitos pop a couple days after the rains, then the real mosquito war starts!!!"
Pigsterz we were at Buccanos today and saw folks walking from Playa Azul to Buccanos and they were swatting like crazy. They are everywhere .. Bring the spray.
"I took one of those off clip on fans last september , it helped a little."
"Speaking of, what sprays work best and what % deet is required for the little buggers.....they LOVE me so I need to douse myself in spray."
"I use Deep Woods Off Sportsmen, 30% DEET. It works good here in St Louis, Id imagine it'd work in Coz, although we've never had a problem with skeeters in Coz. Im sure this wet weather has made it rough, though.I get it at WalMart Sporting Goods section.Edited: 7 years ago "
We bring deep woods off.. Works for us. 43% deet. We have bought higher concentrated stuff before in the camping section of Academy though.
"We used DEEP WOODS OFF it helped a lot. Also bought RAID for mosquitos that you burn like incense... Locals told us about it, got it at Mega. I have bern to Cozumel several times and never saw a single one but today I was attacked, didnt spray, bad me! I killed 11 from the time I sat down at breakfast till I ordered. Had to move inside. Those suckers even got on our airplane."
"Best stuff for this epidemic is Bens 100Max tick and insect repellent ...worked great in Peru in August ......98.11% DEET....can't go wrong, I promise..not for everyday..but worth vacation safety"
"If you do get bitten and can't help but scratch the itch, put Orajel toothache pain reliever cream on the bite. It numbs the skin and helps you not scratch it. My doctor told me about this trick when I got horrible sand flea bites that itched for months on end from another island we visited."
now if it stays rain free for a while will the bug problem calm down ? Is it really buggy right now because of the recent rain ?
I haven't seen it this bad in several years....! They were bad on the plaza tonight!
The problem is it is the wet season now wicked.......
"I should be a test subject for a company to test their products on. My husband jokes that he doesn't need bug spray if I am there. Ha! Thanks for the orajel tip. Be careful if using 100% deet as it will melt plastic and is not kind to some of the man made fabrics. I hate the stuff, but sometimes it is my only option. We will be there in a 10 days, so I hope that it calms down."
"We arrived yesterday and those mosquitoes are not playing around. Being from our part of Texas we are use to them, but wow, not that many! lol Fast run to Mega for Off yesterday and then all was right with the world again."
"I have started using the creams (Autan, Deep Woods) and fine they cover much better. I react horribly to the bites and this has really helped. Also, don't wait till you get to Cozumel to buy your stuff. I have done that, and when things get bad, the shops do run out. You do NOT want to be caught short."
Excellent point...you do NOT want to be caught short and it was mentioned to me by a friend that the people who actually live there need bug spray too and if tourists empty out the supply there isn't any left for the locals. If you take too much I'm sure leaving it for a maid or giving it to your dive boat crew etc. would be greatly appreciated. I've also heard that the the wrist band and clip on products don't work very well at all.
I have been to coz once. Going again but not sure if I need to spend the $37 per person for the cab fair to Iberostar. Taking my wife and two daughters. Is there a better way?
"For 45 aprox you could rent a VW car or even a jeep, but we would have to open a new topic for that.Here we are talking about Mosquitos!!! :)"
Don't know where you got your info but it would not be $37. per person. Just buy a shuttle van ticket at the airport and use the vans out front. Andy yeah....you posted on the wrong thread...lol.
