"With so much negativity and reports of sickness, I thought we should have some positive news.If you were in cancun anytime in april up until the present AND you have been home for 3+ days without any symptoms, put your name on the list.If you want, you can add info about your flights (connections, etc) and hotel where you stayed.Let's keep this bumped!!So who's first??"
"I actually go back yesterday from a week-long stay at the Royal Mayan. I made it to the Chichen Itza on Tuesday, the day before it closed. If it weren't for the fact many service workers were wearing masks, you wouldn't have a clue about the swine flu. Take your GermX with you and have fun. We did."
"ASP and Moon 4/14-4/28. Air Tran flight 42 to Atlanta and then 506 to Baltimore. We feel fine despite the fact that the guy in front of us coughed his head off for at least an hour in the beginning of flight 42.No protocol set up for anyone to check him when we landed in Atlanta because I asked the flight attendent. The same day a flight from Cancun to Baltimore ,nonstop I think,detained all passengers while 3 people were checked.Not flu, too much to drink!"
"I don't think you can use 3+ days as the criteria. It seems like people are still getting sick at the 7-10 mark.And didn't I read that you can be a carrier and never get sick?Don't want to be a buzz-wrecker, but if you want the thread to be useful, I just think you should make at least 7 days (and no one else sick, of course)."
Ok Cancun SusieQ - now you've gone and ruined all my fun! This is a casual poll - I'm not collecting data for the CDC.Addendum to Initial post:Indicate how long you've been back without you or anyone around you displaying symptoms.
"Week of 4/19 4 of us, 3 days at Moon Palace , 3 at JW Marriott home since Monday (its Saturday) all are well, no symptoms"
"Our family of four got back 8 days ago after staying at the cancun palace from the 17th to the 23rd of april. We connected in Charlotte, NC. Landed in Maine happy and healthy. We absolutely will return to paradise soon. Thanks for the positive thread. "
"We were in Cancun at the Golden Parnassus 4/15-25, visited friends at their homes and ate at local eateries, flew home on via Miami and we are both fine. No s/sx of the flu for us or our family/friends. "
Love this post. We are going soon and would love to see this number climb and continue to be bumped.
"I went to Mexico and came back flu-free (so far)[SNIPPED...] CNN Producer Valerie Streit returns from vacation in Mexico. She found out about swine flu pandemic while on the beach. She saw many wearing surgical masks, but she skipped them - here's her story:cnn.com/2009/â€¦index.html"
bump
RPLA April 16-23 Hubby and I.... Feeling great still... just miss the wonderful vacation we had!
We were in Cancun 4/13-4/17. We're fine and don't know anyone who got sick. We didn't even hear about the flu until we got back.
Wife and I stayed at Beach Palace 4/19-4/24. Back for 10 days feel fine. Only complaint we have is in the pain in our a## from people asking us if we have the swine flu. Our flights were delta 536 Cancun to Atlanta and delta 1497 Atlanta to Birmingham. 
"Mexico's tourism industry has really taken a battering this year with the drug war scares and now this flu. Of course, there is always reason to be cautious, but this 24-hours news business can sometimes do more harm than good. They have to have a story. And each station tries to outdo the next by hyping every story to the max.Statistically, there have been NO cases of swine flu reported in the Mayan Riviera. The flu cases have developed from folks who traveled to Cancun (but they obviously did not get the flu in Cancun). The problem, of course, is the air travel...traveling with other passengers from other places (probably Mexico City where there is a significant problem).It doesn't help that the warnings are on the airwaves 24-7 and that the Vice President has a loose tongue that regularly spits out wrong info. It seems the latest fun thing to do is keep the pants scared off folks over one thing or another.When you turn off the sound and look at the stats...well, it doesn't look the same. Put a bottle of Purell in your pocket and use it...have fun. "
"kzdallas, you say they obviously didn't get the flu in Cancun. I don't think that's obvious. Why do you say that? Alot of people seem to have gone to Cancun, some on direct flights.This is a map of cases in Mexico...it looks to me like there are at least 14 cases in the area -- but I don't speak Spanish so I don't know for sure if that's right.http://uchalas.com/influenza/"
The reporters comparison to the JFK assasination is stupid. She is young and stupid - either that or she simply relishes hyporbole.
"Been back since Thursday and feeling great! Stayed at GR Solaris and had I not received a text message from home, wouldn't have even known the epidemic existed. Flew straight from Cancun to Seattle and had no problems at the airport. "
*puts hand up*Week in Cancun at JW Marriott. Great time. Never met anyone who was sick or knew anyone who was sick.heh I don't think TA could handle posts from the millions of tourists who have come back healthy since this scare began. 
"We went on 4/17- 4/23. Came back healthy, happy and tan :) Already planning our next trip!!"
"we were there 4/11-4/18 came back healthy and rested.Folks we met down there from NY are fine too! I am only sick of people asking me if i got the FLU!Feel like i never went at this point, planning on going back next year.Stayed at the Riu had a great time, beautiful weather, flew directly back to Boston/ Logan. No problems!! "
"Stayed at The Royal Mayan 4/25-5/2 only saw a few workers with masks on! Had an AWESOME time relaxing at the pool, working on my tan. Didn't get sick and never meet or heard of anyone getting sick.Had a direct flight on Saturday USAIR #810"
"Just back from Cancun, stayed at Crown Paradise Club, 4 people April 25 - May 3'rd , so far all healthy. Got an extra 5 days off as worked asked me to stay home and return to work on May 11th!!"
"We were at the Valentin Imperial Maya from April 24th to May 2nd (Loved it!). Came home on Saturday with no problems and feel great! So many people die every year of the regular flu but no one talks about that. Thanks to the media for blowing this way out of proportion, my employer asked me to stay home an extra week too!"
"hey everybody just getting back- is everything operating ie. xel-ha, cozumel ferry, mujeres ferry etc? i've heard rumors that things were shut down. i'm leaving for cancun on may 8"
I think they said today everything will reopen teh 7th except for some schools so you should be ok.
"""kzdallas, you say they obviously didn't get the flu in Cancun. I don't think that's obvious. Why do you say that? Alot of people seem to have gone to Cancun, some on direct flights.This is a map of cases in Mexico...it looks to me like there are at least 14 cases in the area -- but I don't speak Spanish so I don't know for sure if that's right.http://uchalas.com/influenza/ ""SusieQ Cancun, I just followed the same link you provided. I do speak Spanish and I don't see any marks anywhere near Quintana Roo, in fact the whole peninsula is free of any confirmed cases.I live in Cancun. I am sure they don't have a special cover up to ""fool"" the official data being collected. Therefore I agree with Kzdallas, obviously these people did not get sick in Cancun.This virus does very very bad in warm weather. Under the right conditions, it can survive up to 3 hours outside a host. My guess is that those who visited Cancun and got the porky flu, got it on the plane (not even at the airport). You are right Susie, A LOT of people did come to Cancun, out of the thousands that were here during the last two weeks of April, only a hand full have reported any issues. To me it is obvious it happened in the plane. A direct flight doesn't tell us anything! Direct flight means they flew from Cancon to their home town non stop. Maybe an infected passenger from a different state in Mex (probably Mexico City) was flying to the same destination, with a stop in Cancun or a change of plane in Cancun, hence catching the same ""Direct"" flight. Another possibility is that a sick passenger left his germs behind in the plane, and being that planes are usually kept ""cool"" the virus survived long enough for the next set of passengers to pick it up.So this post asks about those who went back home after visiting Cancun. I have lived in Cancun for over 5 months, and I still don't have the swine flu. My family is not sick, none of my friends or their family/friends are sick. This weekend I went to Playa del Carmen and Tulum, and the only indication of the ""flu"" is the fact that as precaution many super markets and restaurants/bars are providing masks for their employees."
"Family of 4 back from Royal Caribbean 4/11 - 4/18. That seems to be the week things started to break - we knew nothing while we were there, but it hit the news shortly upon our return. That is also the week a few of the early cases in the US were visiting Cancun. Fortunately, we are all healthy and way past the incubation period. So, with no extra precautions, we avoided catching the virus."
We were a group of four who stayed at the Great Parnassus from April 26-30. Direct flights from St. Louis. Everyone is fine.While we were there we visited Tulum (workers were wearing masks) and several other locations with Edventure Tours on April 28. Food court workers started wearing masks on April 29th.
We came back better than when we left. Tan and feeling great. I think you are more likely to catch a STD than the swine flu!!
"was in cancun April 22-26th, my sister and I are 100% healthy and had an AMAZING TIME!!!!"
We were at CPC April 16-21st. Came back healthy!!!Having serious sunshine & sushi withdrawals though!!! lol
