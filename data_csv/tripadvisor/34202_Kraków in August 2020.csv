What are our chances of travelling to Kraków on 17 August this year from U.K.
95%
"For being able to travel from the UK to Kraków in August I'd also upvote 95%.On the other hand, for being able to use such a travel for tourist purposes, I'd estimate it much lower than that. I consider it very likely that in case of a country with as bad COVID situation as the UK, it might be that travelling will already be allowed but a mandatory 14-days quarantine will still be obligatory for people coming from the ""bad"" countries. Obviously, it would surely depends on if the UK is still actually so ""bad"", because it could (hopefully it will!) change a lot by August.Edited: 1:27 pm, May 29, 2020 "
"Since most restrictions in Poland have been lifted, in August it may turn out that both countries are at the same level so there is no reason to keep the borders closed. I read the other day that only 20% of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the UK have covid symptoms which is about the same we've discovered in Poland. Vast majority of infected people have no symptoms, those that are most at risk of bad outcome and burden on local health care won't travel anyway so it's time to end this farce.Edited: 2:01 am, May 30, 2020 "
"In Philippines, 90%+ has no symptoms. That said, chances of me going to Poland January is 103571029750167296%?"
"I hope that by January most governments will discover that there is no point restricting cross border movement or quarantining healthy people just because they carry some viral RNA fragments in their throats.Edited: 5:25 am, May 30, 2020 "
"There's a good chance that 1 or both countries will still have the 14 day quarantine in place, Poland does not appear to have reached a peak of virus cases yet, numbers have plateaued recently, probably due to so little testing taking place.All you can do is watch and wait, as with travel anywhere else in the world."
"That peak may never come. It's just one of the theoretical models. Viruses do not read epidemiology books. More likely we'll be living with the virus for years to come and even the countries that initially limited the spread will experience its resurgence unless they are self-sufficient and 100% isolated. Nobody and nothing gets in. Perhaps there are such places in the world but I'm not aware of any in Europe.Edited: 6:42 am, May 30, 2020 "
It's possible you will be able to if you live in Europe. If coming from the U.S it may be a different story.
