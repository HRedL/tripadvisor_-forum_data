Just protect yourself against mozzies with a good insect repellant which will also provide protection against Dengue Fever.Tommo
Many mosquitoes in Davao and Samal area?constantly splashing repellent?
There are many mosquitoes in the entire Philippines and all other tropical countries here in Asia. Insect repellants are widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets.
"kegler747 ,many cases last month in Davao?"
There's no news about malaria cases in Davao City last month but there were cases of malaria in a town more than 150 kilometers from the city last year --> …inquirer.net/251336/malaria-epidemic-declar…
"Hi ClareirishmanMalaria notwithstanding, I was hoping you wouldn't mind me asking you about Mindanao.My partner is originally from Lanuza but has not been home for 10 years.We are visiting PH in October, my fist visit there.After exploring Luzon where we will be using a driver or bus for long journeys, we are flying to Davao. Being a pigheaded Mayo man I have rented a car from Avis Davao and will be driving to Lanuza, we will be spending 5 days there and will need a car. Afterwards I will be driving back to Davao.I have driven around india and on the wrong side of the road in many countries and will be driving with lots of cautious positivity and extra car insurance!Unfortunately Avis cannot supply a GPS/Satnav so I will be guided by A4 sheet printouts of googlemap info- so was wondering if you could help me out with any information regarding roads, terrain or anything at all which might be helpful.Many thankstomred61"
That malaria map is way out of date.
I would read these threads before I would consider driving as a foreigner. Generally not recommended and drivers are very cheap anyway.tripadvisor.com.au/…36570084 tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g294245-i3256-k…Tommo

"tomred61,pm you."
"The malaria map is inaccurate.This is from the US CDC:MalariaAreas with malaria: Present in rural areas <600 m (1,969 ft) on the islands of Basilu, Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Palawan, Sulu (Jolo), and Tawi-Tawi. None in urban areas.Estimated relative risk of malaria for US travelers: Low.Drug resistance4: Chloroquine.Malaria species: P. falciparum 70%–80%, P. vivax 20%–30%.Recommended chemoprophylaxis: Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine."
"On my first two visits to Iligan City, Mindanao, just to be on the safe side I took "" Malerone "" pills with me. As a 16 day supply of these malaria preventative pills cost me around $200 USD ( even at a discount pharmacy they were not much less expensive than that ) I finally gave up on the idea as Malaria seems to not have been a problem where I was. I still take a couple of pump spray bottles of "" Off Deep Woods "" insect repellent which contains 25% Deet. More of a threat than Malaria these days is Dengue Fever and as far as I know there is no preventative for that yet. The mosquitoes that carry Dengue Fever can be found in urban and rural areas, day and night. I think a good quality insect repellent is the best bet."
