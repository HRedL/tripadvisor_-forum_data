Can anyone update us on the prevalence of Denge in Lo De Marcos. We have heard Oct & Nov was terrible and we just had a friend return from there who was diagnosed with Denge. We were planning to spend a month there but are reconsidering.
"I t doesn't seem that anyone is going to answer ... so I'll give it a shotThere are mosquitos all up and down the west coast of Mexico ... some places have more ... some lessThere is no way to tell if any Mossie is carrying Denque or any other virusBest to slather on some bug dope ... especially in the early morning, late evenings and when around lots of FoilageA month in LdM or a different spot will probably not make much difference"
"A guy who runs a restaurant there had it, he said he was super sick for two wks and after two months is up and running around as usual but food and drink tastes off to him, He said he'd never been so sick in his life. His wife had a milder strain of it that didnt last as long and wasnt as harsh."
"There is a Dengue epidemic this year in Mexico, but Lo de Marcos/Nayarit are not as badly affected as other places. You should take precautions to minimize mosquito bites."
