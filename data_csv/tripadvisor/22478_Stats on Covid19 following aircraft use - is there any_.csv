"When we were discussing our plans for taking any trips later this year last night , my husband said that he wondering whether if there is any statistical information about numbers of airline passengers developing Covid19 infections following taking airline flights and/or any stats on aircrew being at increased risk of developing it themselves ? My husband is not currently convinced by airlines' claims that their aircon filtration systems are good enough to remove any airborne Covid19 infected droplets and thus avoid them being recycled back into the cabin.Does anyone know how often (if at all) aircrew and airport staff are tested for infection and/or antibodies for example and if there is such a thing a a website with details can somebody post link to where it can be viewed please? ThanksEdited: 2:02 pm, July 22, 2020 "

I read an article recently talking about where cases spread and surprisingly it said there weren’t a lot of case groups known to have come from airplanes. The article author did not know why that was. It speculated on some reasons like better filtration or the fact people don’t talk a lot in planes compared to other scenarios like a bar or restaurant. Or that people mostly sit quietly or sleep and were not breathing hard like a gym class. But it was speculation. There hasn’t been any studies. Just observations that cases didn’t seem to spread as much in planes as in other indoor closed spaces. Sorry i do not remember where I read the article.
"Pax on MAD-ACE flight was positive. No one else tested positive. Pax on UK-ACE flight showed a fever on checking in to hotel. Tested negative, twice. Asymptomatic partner tested positive. People sat nearby on flight all negative so far. I'd be more concerned about catching it in the airport where air quality and air flow isn't as good."
One of the problems is that the incubation period for covid19 is 2 to 14 days (hence the 14 day quarantine period).If a person who had taken a flight recently was to test positive it would be almost impossible to be 100% certain where they were infected.
"I have to say that I am more concerned about the airport than the aircraft. I agree that it would be very difficult to pinpoint where someone picked up the virus. Particularly as some folks appear to be pretty much immune to it while others are far more susceptible.I think that at best there would need to be a big cluster from one particular flight or airport just to serve as an indicator, and even then nothing would be certain."
Thanks anyway guys
"Transport Canada are following several modes of transport https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/servi…I'm a little surprised that ferry services aren't included in the above for BC and the Maritime provinces even with reduced numbers of sailings, although that information may be available from each province's website."
">>>Does anyone know how often (if at all) aircrew and airport staff are tested for infection and/or antibodies for example and if there is such a thing a a website with details can somebody post link to where it can be viewed please?<<<Gday MR,This is based on information I’ve acquired, directly from international tech crew and management of an Australian carrier, a Japanese carrier and a US freight carrier - so this may provide a broad indicator, but not necessarily be factual for all carriers globally.Airline crew are provided guidelines based on the country of travel. Guidelines which (ironically) is mostly a referral back to their own company’s OHS protocols. Beyond self reporting illnesses, and adhering to entry requirements of essential workers (who in many countries are exempt from rigorous or frequent testing, and their exemption allows for short turnarounds 24-72hrs), there are no regular tests carried out (beyond questionnaires and temperature check at entry). The airlines will report of their OHS conduct to relevant health authorities in the country of origin, but have zero contact with health authorities of the visiting country, unless they are screened with symptoms at entry. None of which airlines are required to disclose to any other party.So I don’t think there is any source, who can accurately provide/disclose collective information on testing standards for all airline crew globally"
"An important thing to remember... Airflow on planes it ceiling to floor, not front to back. Hepa filters certainly will take out any droplet that makes its way into the system, Most droplets will settle out on the seats, clothing and floor. Droplets are big which is why masks work. Aerosols should be taken out by hepa filters as well but they are more of a danger to your seatmates.N95 masks are best especially if you never fiddle with them and wear protective eyewear."
"Geomedic. I assume you are a medic and so am I. Completely agree except for the eye covering. There has been no proven case of Covid being spread through the eyes. While it is theoretically possible there’s only one statement by a doctor that he got it that way and he has no way to prove it. No scientific study has shown transmission that way.Edited: 7:55 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"I think that an important aspect, would be what one comes in contact with, on the way to, and in the airport - the plane, itself, is but part of the total equation.Best of luck,Hunt"
"re: post 8. BC Ferries do not come under Transport Canada, they are part of BC's highway system. Both routes from the Vancouver area to either Victoria or Nanaimo create the marine version of the Trans Canada Highway 1. They are owned by the Government of BC in a unique setup. They have adopted some or all of Transport Canada's COVID-19 regulations. The other three ferries from VI to WA State are American owned.https:/…travel-advisory.htmlOur BC Chief Medical Officer announces new COVID-19 cases on an almost daily basis. She has not announced one infection that has been traced back to BC Ferries. The two recent upticks in cases have been from two large (250+) ad hoc social gatherings at beaches.Edited: 11:00 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"'She has not announced one infection that has been traced back to BC Ferries.' I didn't think there had been any cases related to ferry travel, but it's good to hear that, thanks. Apologies for the mental hiccup about ferries being under federal control - I'd blame the sticky heat today but that's not good enough.Boo hiss to the large group at a drum circle at Third Beach on Tuesday evening."
TravellerPlus; BC Ferries absolutely falls under the jurisdiction of Transport Canada as well as other maritime authorities and an onboard crewmember has tested positive. I’ll not engage further or I’ll be up all night.
"Boo hiss indeed, TP. But they were young.T4Tim. You have shown up fairly often to post right after I have in a couple BDFs, mostly TLL and Support. First time in the ATF though. And in the style you have used here. I don't believe in coincidences."
"I have no inside information (or valid qualifications), but I've been following media reports of Covid-19 transmission quite closely. I live in Australia. Many TA readers would know we closed our borders to international travel quite early, and anybody who now arrives by plane is subject to 14 day quarantine.I provide this background because there are two different vested interests in this debate. One side wants proof that people on planes are catching the disease on planes. If this were to occur it would justify the decision to keep the borders closed. The other side, of course, wants to prove that planes are safe, therefore we don't need borders closed and we can fly overseas again.As far as I am aware, there have been no reported cases on planes arriving in Australia, and the contact tracing people haven't yet said anything about plane travellers contracting or transmitting Covid-19. For us, quite a few people in quarantine have tested positive, but none of them have claimed they must have caught the virus on their plane journey.I would be interested in the views of people from other parts of the world, particularly those (like us( who are dependent on long haul travel to go anywhere. Are there verified reports from elsewhere in the travel world?"
Thanks for the latest replies guys
"The conversation you may wish to start is in regard to your health profile / age , do you fall into the 'at risk' group or not ."
"My intention was to keep it general bruin - people should decide on the risk to them individually according to their own situations (and medical advice too of course)Edited: 8:44 am, July 23, 2020 "
">>>As far as I am aware, there have been no reported cases on planes arriving in Australia<<<No *media* reported - which is because hotel quarantine has grabbed all the media headlines, and they did not have access to those passengers who were detained with symptoms prior to the rest being shuttled to the hotels.This is just for NSWhttps:/…nsw-intEdited: 10:16 am, July 23, 2020 "
"Detained as in held back for further testing at the airport and then hospitalised or transferred to the hotels separately. There has been quite a number of passengers who have been confirmed for Covid during their quarantine in the hotels - which is also not publicisedEdited: 10:20 am, July 23, 2020 "
"Post 12: ""I think that an important aspect, would be what one comes in contact with, on the way to, and in the airport - the plane, itself, is but part of the total equation.""A family member and one of his flightcrew tested positive, two days apart, in different locations. No other crew tested positive and the closest trace came down to a 'likely probability"" of one of two airports and one of two flights. A day cannot be pinpointed, nor is it known if they were even infected at the same time."
