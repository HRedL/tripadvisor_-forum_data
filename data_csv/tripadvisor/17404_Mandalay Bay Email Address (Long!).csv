I would call MB and ask for a name of a senior person in their customer service/relations department. I'd then send them a letter via old fashioned snail mail. That shows you're serious and are making an effort a lot more than an email would. Good luck!
You think snail mail would be more effective? Will try that then - thank you so much!
Why have you waited several months to address this? I think it would have been more effective to address it closer to the incident.
Who said I waited several months? I said I BOOKED the room several months ago. I just got back a couple of days ago. :)
"OK, sorry! My bad! :)I agree with the snail mail approach. Having an actual paper trail in a situation like this would be a good thing.Good luck!"
Thank you! And no worries!
"Not to discourage you, but I also had a problem involving security and a bartender at the Eyecandy bar at Mandalay Bay, who threatened to call security as I was ""stealing drinks"" by not playing fast enough on the video poker machine during a busy night (Halloween night), even though I'd already run $100 through the machine (they're dollar machines at the bartops and I was playing a progressive max bet).I sent four hand-written letters to Mandalay Bay via postal mail. My letters were addressed to President/COO Mr. Bill Hornbuckle, VP Marketing Mr. Scott Voeller, VP Sales Mr. Richard Harper, and one simply addressed to ""Customer Service"". I included my name, player's card number, and a brief run-down of the altercation along with the date and time.Unfortunately, and quite surprisingly, I never heard a single thing back from any of them, or their general customer service department. Not even a form letter.Their current President appears to be Chuck Bowling. You might want to address it to him, as well as a general customer service. If you do a bit of digging online you'll probably find his email address, which I'm guessing is cbowling@mandalaybay.com."
"if you really want them to know you mean business send your letter to a particular person.. â€“ Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino President and Chief Operating Officer, Chuck Bowling,...and send it return receipt requested.that should get you noticed!"
so funny zx...but definitely use snail mail!
"ZX....don't worry....as much as I'd love to get a response back, or some form of compensation (wouldn't complain), I don't have high expectations. But it's worth a shot.I'll try sending it to this Chuck Bowling guy and see what happens....if I hear anything back I'll keep you guys posted!"
"Also, keep a copy of the letter you send. Create a paper trail, document all phone calls, and correspondence. Names, dates, times, keep track of it all."
I would send a copy of your letter to the president of MGM and include the text of your posting here to make sure the nature of your complaint is fully described. You might get a response faster from the property manager/president if he knows the issue has been brought to the attention of those at the top.
kris621Hope this problem didn't spoil the day too much - just a couple of thoughts.Might be useful to get something from your DJ to support your case along the lines of he had done previous weddings without issue and the music at this function was no louder than previous events.A couple of supporting notes from other guests to back up your version of events might also be helpful.I'm sure I don't need to tell you that a factual complaint outlining the sequence of events etc is more likely to succeed than an emotion fuelled rant.I did not expect you to go down the rant route but I know that sometimes the heart takes over from the brain.Best of luckTomC
"Jess - Paper trail, got itOSU - That's a good idea. How would I go about finding who the president of the MGM properties is? I will try Google!Tom - This is why I've waited a few days to even think of writing the letter. I want to be factual and polite, but get my point across. I know I'll get nowhere with a rant so I figured it'd be best to cool down a little bit.Thanks everyone! As much as it sucked, we haven't let it ruin our day - everything else was perfect."
"Sounds like Security were trying to be courteous to all and that you and your group continued to not comply for a long time. Also, not clear on what you're looking for with your complaint. In addition, there were rooms above, below and beside you, and wedding days do not grant special privileges.There are at least 2 sides to every story, and we don't have Security's nor the bothered other guest's.""To be honest, I didn't mind that it got shut down early because I was beat,..."" - Consider sending them a letter of thanks.Ultimately, water under the bridge. Let it go and concentrate on enjoying a wonderful life with your new husband."
"nightdrive, why must the OP be ""looking for something"" with the complaint? Perhaps it's just a matter of principle in that the person was told this suite would be applicable for what they wanted to use it for, and then they were embarrassed by Mandalay Bay's security in front of their guests? When I wrote my letters to Mandalay Bay, I wasn't looking for compensation, I was looking for ""We're looking into the matter"" or ""We'll make sure we train our bartenders to not be assholes"" or even ""Thanks for taking the time to write this to inform us"". The fact that they sent nothing in return has led me to avoiding their property since that trip, and has led to me re-telling that story to anyone who has asked about the property both in person and here on TA."
"I agree with nightdrive, sounds like security and management were courteous but stern with you. Simple fact is you were throwing a loud party in your suite and there was someone in a room near you who didn't appreciate that. They asked you to be quiet twice but you didn't comply (okay, you turned the music down but rarely does that make a party much quieter) so they finally kicked your guests out. Ultimately, sounds like the hotel judged the guest(s) around you to be more important then yourself. Sucks but writing them an angry letter won't get you anywhere in this case."
"Nightdrive - We actually did comply. Security asked us, politely, twice to turn down the music just a little bit, which we did. They came up the third time and we requested to speak to the person who was actually MAKING the demand, which in my opinion is not an unreasonable request. After not getting anywhere with him, the guests did all leave. I never said that I wanted any compensation - although hey, that would be nice. I want to address how poorly we were treated in the end. I have no complaints about the first two security guards - but the third incident, when they swarmed the room, I do have an issue with. I never requested ""special privileges"" but the hotel was well aware of a wedding reception being in that room, and it was only 9:30pm when the complaint from ONE room started (yes, it was ONE room that was complaining - security confirmed this).And yes, I was okay with the fact that it ended early, but I was NOT okay with how we were treated. I was embarrassed, upset, and angry. Why should I send them a letter of thanks? Although I was hoping the reception wouldn't go really late, I also wasn't planning on it to end the way it did."
"""Sucks but writing them an angry letter won't get you anywhere in this case.""Who said my letter would be angry?I'm writing them to state facts and share my feelings & experiences.People write hotels to complain about their lack of coffee makers, for crying out loud. Being as you were not there, you can't really judge if the security was ""polite but stern"" - they were nowhere near that."
"When I've had to do something like this, I've sent the letter via registered mail. This ensures that you will get a receipt. Good luck. I can't imagine anyone in Las Vegas complaining about noise before midnight."
Anyways - thank you to those that have responded with helpful comments - very much appreciated =) I got what I needed out of this thread and will just leave it at that.
"kris621- First and foremost Congratulations on your marriage! I do hope you stop reading this thread. You lived it and only YOU know how YOUR experience actually was. Virtually every thread will have pros/cons, I think you will keep getting frustrated about the incident and reliving it in your mind if you keep replying to the cons on this thread. I'm sure nobody means harm either way but there is no benefit to you by continuing to read and respond on here. I hope you let the thread go,,,, and write your letter if so inclined."
"if it was me i would be writing a letter to. No reason to be treated like that no matter who you are. You met the demands of the security team, and they continued to come back. Working in the past for security, i first address the problem with the offending party then you go and work with the party that complained. I would have explained their is a wedding reception going on and they have turned it down. Is it still to loud blah blah blah. You spend i am assuming a good amount of money and have the right to enjoy what you paid for. Good luck let us know what you get in return"
"I don't know, maybe it's just me but I personally wouldn't host 30 people in a hotel room, music or not. That many people are going to be noisey unless they are not talking. I wouldn't want to disrupt those around me and keep them from enjoying the suite that they paid good money for. I understand that you paid for it but your noise should not impact them. If it were me I would have reserved a room in a bar, club or other facility more set up for handling large groups and noise. I probably would have been that person calling to complain and either asked them to move me away or put a stop to the noise. My first request would have been to be moved so you could do your thing and I could still get my rest. Not everyone is in Vegas to party and stay up all night and their room should be a place where they can rest and have quiet.That's just my opinion. Not that it matters."
"I agree with Mrs. Combs. I am really surprised to hear any hotel would allow a party with 30 guests late into the night in any type of guest room. I'm not trying to give the bride any more grief or argue about what has or has not been allowed in those suites in the past. I'm just saying it surprises me.I would have thought renting a banquet or conference room in a separate area of the hotel away from the guest rooms would be the appropriate thing to do for a party that large.I realize unplanned parties happen all the time and I have been in hotel rooms where lots of people were partying late. But, when someone finally complained security came and broke up the parties.I have also been in planned hospitality suite parties, but those have usually been early evening planned activities, not late night events."
"Honestly, I abhor noisy neighbors in a hotel, but even I would have trouble with it being so early. I usually don't complain unless it's after midnight (oh, ok, 11)...the only thing I can think of is that the people next to you were either sick, or were jet lagging. But I think the music was just part of the problem, sometimes voices really carry (some hotel walls are so thin), but to have 30 people talking, plus music, it must have been much louder than you could imagine.And I think it was a 3 strikes and you're out policy...they told you twice, the third time there was no mercy."
"Snail mail probably is the best way to deal with this. As an alternate, you may want to write an actual letter, then email the letter to the head honcho as an attachment.When you write the letter, state the issue clearly and with as much detail as you can. Also, an important (but usually neglected) part of the letter is a description of what your expectations are from the Hotel in terms of solving your problem.If you just write a letter and vent, most likely they will not take any action. If you want the Hotel to investigate the complaint and get back to you, say so. If you want the Hotel to fire the head of security, say so. If you want a free room or money, say so.It doesnt mean they will give you what you want, but they will know what your expectations are and can make a decision on whether or not they are willing to have their response meet your expectations. At the very least, ask for a response; this makes it harder for them to just file the letter."
"Ive got to side with the hotel. When you through a party and there are noise complaints then they did what they needed to do.If you live in a house and have a party and neighbors complain about noise the police will show up, then if they get more complaints will show up again and break up the party. Having a party with 30 people in a hotel room is surely going to be noisy and if you have a few neighbors that dont like it the hotel will react. It seems to me they reacted appropriately.Edited: 9 years ago "
"What many of you seem to be missing is that this was not a standard hotel room, it is a Vista Suite. It's a 1,705 square foot suite designed for entertaining. That's bigger than many people's houses. The main room is over a thousand square feet by itself.The preview pictures on Mandalay Bay's site show no less than twenty chairs, bar stools, or other seats, not counting any chairs or beds in the bedroom area (or the bathroom!). Mandalay Bay's own site says it's suitable for 35 people. This is not a room that you're expected to book for two people. They are designed for large groups, and large groups should be expected to make noise.Last stay at THEhotel, I could hear the party at Mix all night long. If I had complained, would they turn the music down three times and start escorting guests out? Of course not. In the same regard, if this room was recommended to the poster as a wedding reception room, I see no reason why they would have a problem with it actually happening.Edited: 9 years ago "
"They should have offered you a reception room after the second complaint. That would have made you happy and the people trying to sleep happy. But it's Vegas, why didn't you all just move downstairs to the casino or go to a club? Congratulations and don't let this ruin how you feel about your wedding. It will make a great story to tell later and you'll laugh about it. Beth"

"My first thought was Facebook also. It seems to get the attention the fastest. But back it up with paper also & do screen prints of your facebook posts in case they pull them down.I can't quite figure this one out either. If you were trying to stuff these people into a regular room, well that is one thing. But a room that is specifically designed for that quantity of people & for that type of event, that's another. Plus it was booked FOR that type of event. I can honestly say if I were the other guest I may have called & requested the noise level be cut back (but not at 9:30!!!!!). However, if they had explained to me that there was a wedding reception going on I would have requested they move ME - why would I want to ruin someone's celebration if I can sleep just as well in another room? If it were 30 drunken frat boys....well that might be a different matter. :) :)"
They must be profiling against canucks...they knew you were from BC and didn't want a riot to break out? =)
"Perhaps I'm in the minority but I still can't understand why one person thinks it's okay to infringe on the liberties of another person simply because of a certain situation?I don't care if you can't sleep and you're bothered by the noise, it's my wedding day.On the other hand, I think the MB should have moved the people that were complaining... unless, of course, that was a regular customer of theirs."
"Have to say that I hate you were disappointed w your wedding reception. But I don't understand why you would have had it in a hotel room either. Even in the Vista Suite. It's Vegas, there are 100s or places to go! And I have to say that if I went to a wedding there and people said "" and we're having cocktails etc in a suite at the hotel"". I would have said ""see ya"" and hit the town like I always do. But to each his own. If people complain then you have to completely comply."
"Paper trail, snail mail? What's all this time and effort going to accomplish? Do you want the president of Mandalay bay or MGM to write you a personal apology letter? It's not going to change what happened and it probably won't change their policy if it happens again to someone else. A simple call to the front desk explaining your intentions would have probably not caused this to happen. I say give it up. Again - what are you going to accomplish with all of your effort. Just don't stay there anymore. In retrospect, both you and the hotel should have had more of a conservation as to the specific details of the party and set some basic ground rules."
"Undathesea, your post is very interesting:""Perhaps I'm in the minority but I still can't understand why one person thinks it's okay to infringe on the liberties of another person simply because of a certain situation?I don't care if you can't sleep and you're bothered by the noise, it's my wedding day.""I'm really not sure who you think was being infringed upon. Does a person have a right to have quiet in their hotel room? Does a different person have a right to hold a party in a suite intended for that purpose? It seems both would feel their rights were most important.At the end of the day my vote is that a hotel room, is, ultimately, a place to sleep. Parties can take place anywhere...you can't go down to the casino or a bar or restaurant and go to sleep."
"""But I don't understand why you would have had it in a hotel room either. Even in the Vista Suite. It's Vegas, there are 100s or places to go! And I have to say that if I went to a wedding there and people said "" and we're having cocktails etc in a suite at the hotel"". I would have said ""see ya"" and hit the town like I always do""Believe it or not, ""in suite weddings"" are what LOTS or brides do these days. Browse the Knot Las Vegas forum and you'll see that it's the norm. Furthermore, what happened to me is NOT the norm. As nighdrive said - these suites are designed for large amounts of people & parties - it even says in their room description that the suite can hold up to 30 people, comfortably. NOT ONLY THAT, THE HOTEL TOLD ME IT WOULD BE OKAY. They were well aware that it would be a wedding reception and didn't seem the slightest bit phased.And I would hope if you came down to Vegas for a wedding, you'd actually go to the reception, wherever it may be, instead of deciding that you'd rather go hit the town. We went to Caesars for 2 nights when we checked out of Mandalay Bay and one of the higher ups was checking over a larger suite in the Forum Tower. We explained our Mandalay Bay situation and asked her if people had parties in this suite and she laughed and said, ""All the time, we expect it to happen""."
"From Post 21:""I got what I needed out of this thread and will just leave it at that.""Famous last words."
"In a hotel, all guests are treated equally. The other guests on the floor had to be respected as well as yourself. They should have given you an option to take the party after a certain hour to another location in the hotel. You did mention you had a DJ.I truly think your complaint will go unfounded."
"I kind of watched this with amusement, and a little surprise that it actually took 2 dozen posts before anyone recognized that there was another POV. That's unusual because this board is one of the more even sided I've seen. And very rarely blindly states ""Poor Baby the big bad hotel, casino, restaurant, business treated you wrong"" without considering the other side.Kris: I can understand your POV. But many things in life are a matter of point of view. And someone elses is often just as valid as yours.While I think of myself as having much more in common with Mr Spock than with Captain Kirk, that is not the case politically. Like Captain Kirk I devoutly believe that the rights of the individual are more important than the rights of the group.This can sometimes be a little difficult to accept if you happen to be part of the group and it's your wedding day. But I like to think that Mr Spock would have seen the light by the end of the movie.I'm not trying to make light of your post. But that is truly what I believe. And I wanted to say it without attacking you, or ranting from the top of my soap box."
"Kris621, congratulations on your wedding and happy to hear your rotten experience did not spoil your day....YES, you should send the complaint letter as I feel your complaints are valid, especially since the hotel was aware of how many guests you were having in the Vista room. The Vista Room was intended for parties as advertised (1700 square feet and 25-35 room capacity)... If nothing else, and even if they won't/don't respond, you will have had your say. Good luck!"
"I'm just curious, was the hotel aware that you were hiring a DJ for your suite and if they were, did they give you any info on policies or rules regarding noise/LOUD music?"
I need an email address as I need to contact them to see if there is car parking on site for our RV before I book a room. Anyone know?
What a random bump....
"auburnu,There seems to be an epidemic today of first time posters replying to year old threads. This is the 5th or 6th one today (just on the Vegas forum)."
"since it's bumped anyway, I wonder if she/he ever got a response from MB and what their side of the story was"
"The other side of the story is that she had a DJ blasting music in her room, had security come up twice and ask her to turn it down, had security come up a third time and tell people to leave, wouldn't start sending her guests out for over a half hour, had them slowly leave after that, and was upset that the security people frowned at her while she argued with them."
"Note the the recent bumper, emails to Vegas hotels are usually a waste of time. Call and ask your RV question."
"I'm leaning to that being the other side, considering the Vistas are sleeping rooms and they have non-sleeping hospitality rooms, which is where she probably shoulda been....boring on the forum and now I'm working on old posts....time to go do something more productive. Too bad someone wouldn't start a new ""root of all evil"" thread for me."
"Hi,This happenned to me this last weekend I had booked a media suite for my husbands 40th birthday had guest fly in from all over I was told over the phone they allow suite parties we used there surround system, not only did they make all of our guest leave they also forcefully arrested one of mine, I was so humiliated. I want my money back were you successful in a response to your letters???"
What did your guest do to get arrested?
"First post, all of a sudden."
"""What did your guest do to get arrested?""Take your choice:A) Stole $5,500 from a safe.B) Failure to have adequate ""loss of use"" coverage on rental vehicle.C) Stole the $90 robe from room.D) All of the Above."
