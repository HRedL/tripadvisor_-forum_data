"Hello,I am due to fly from Aus > Christchurch tomorrow evening for permanent work and to live with my partner in our new home. Due to these new closures, am I allowed in under being a partner, or proving I am here permantly? I have left my entire life in Australia already and have no idea what to do if I cannot get into the country. I have already spent a lot of money to ensure my isolation period would not affect anyone else in my household. *Note my partner and I are not married but have been together for 4 years now and can show proof of thisPlease help.. I am beyond stressed having nothing to go back to as I am crashing at a friends until I was/am due to leave. :("
Have a look on this site. Hope it can help.  https:/…coronavirus-update-inz-response
Sorry BrieNZ citizens and those holding a NZ permanent resident visa only.If only you had flown here a few days earlier.
"WLnz - I thought partners of kiwis were allowed too. Brie, best you call NZ immigration (hopefully you'll get through). Ensure you have whatever proof you have available to show your partnership status. I'm guessing they'll want to know at the airport in Oz before you board the plane. Then also encourage your partner to be at the airport, with his kiwi passport so he's availabel to talk with immigration if they need proof. Best wishes to you."
Is your partner a NZ citizen or permanent resident?
The info I read earlier - and now of course I can't find the link - said only NZ citizens and those holding a Permanent Resident visa. Partners had to have been living together for 5 years...but I don't work for NZ Immigration so there could be other exceptions. Best of luck to you Brie.
"Brie, what employment do you have in Timaru? If it is in health or other essential work they may make an exception for you."
I think you have to be a citizen or resident otherwise they will turn you away. Covid 19 sucks.
"Best thing to do is call Immigration NZ and explain your situation. They can allow exceptions on humanitarian rounds. If you get on the plane tonight, take prove if you can of your de facto relationship, their NZ residency (maybe like a power bill with address) and your job offer as you'll get another person at the border. This really sucks and I hope you can get in. Please let us know how you get on."
"Partners and children of permanent residents are allowed in.However, if your partner is also just a ""vvisitor"" you are probably out of luck.NZ law does not require a formal relationship.Getting on the plane is going to require proof you will be allowed in.Edited: 3:30 pm, March 19, 2020 "
I thought this was a Travel forum? Not being nasty here but be interpreted that way these are difficult times for everyone. You might have to suck it up until its all over. But I am also betting the OP will not post again either to clarify.
"Is this ""Brie"" or yet another couple caught in the new rules?https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coro…"
I suspect they are just one of many couples (appears to be the wrong way round - ie in the article the woman is the Kiwi & the male partner is the Aussie).I know a couple where the Aussie husband has lived over 40 years in NZ but still has an Aussie passport. They just squeaked in before the lockdown.
PM is allowing Australian citizens who have lived here for a sufficient amount of time entry.
"I became a Kiwi after living here 6 years (4 years ago now) and consider my citizenship ceremony up there with my university graduation as a day of pride (although thankfully less work involved). I have had Aussie friends here ask me why and some ex-friends back in Oz make derisive comments. I know it is only fairly recent that Australia allowed dual citizenship but I cannot understand some of my friends (mainly Brits) who have lived here much longer than me but seem to not be bothered. With elderly relatives back in Sydney, I am thankful I can still travel back if necessary (if there are flights) although the 14 day isolation could be a problem. My 85 year old sister flew over to support me for my relatively minor op last year, It will be upsetting if I cannot do the same for her. It always seemed so close up until now."
"This virus is going to cause all sorts of problems, not just physical. Haddaway referred to this.Border crossings were starting to become more dificult before all of this with the assumption we were all one family being a myth for a while. We were surprised last year when in the UK how many though of this part of the world as still being British. We live in extroadinary times. The world will not be the same."
"Mike (seeing as we're all headed off topic at the moment)... perhaps we technically ARE still British? ... but our day to day life and culture is less and less 'traditional british'. ... we'd noticed this even 20 years ago when I did an international business and culture paper at uni. The lecturer asked the many international students 'what did you think NZ would be like before you came? Now that you're here, how does it differ?' Most said we had alot more American cultural references than they'd expected - by this time we were getting alot more American tv content... These days, I think we've embraced alot more of the Māori culture, plus integrating more of the wide variety of immigrant cultures, and are really developing our own unique kiwi culture. I hope Brie was able to get in, and will post of her success. ... currently I'm hearing that alot of European WVH holders trying to get hone from NZ are having trouble as Australia won't even let them transit! (Australia is giving them 72hours to get sorted!)"
NZ felt very British to me until I heard them abbreviating Coronation Street as Corro.
Seperated by a common language.
