Hi. I'm thinking to book an all inclusive holiday in Hurghada coming September. I wonder if someone could help me with a few questions.1. I'm aware you need to have a health insurance when you go there. Is the travel insurance what travel agencies(like loveholidays in my case) give will be sufficient?2. Is all inclusive service very different now than normally? 3. Will I be able to book a holiday to the Giza pyramids?
"Looking at their policy …loveholidays.com/terms/Loveholidays-UK-Prem… (Admittedly it was March and may have changed but that was their site today!)Read the RED box on Page 1Then Page 12 in the BEWARE section it states:-There is no cover under this policy for cancellation, abandonment or curtailment claims if the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises you not to travel, for example where the FCO advise against all but essential travel to an area affected by Coronavirus, COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-COV-2) or any mutation of Coronavirus, COVID-19 or SARs-COV-2.So, at the moment, their policy will NOT cover you.All Inclusive will be very different.
