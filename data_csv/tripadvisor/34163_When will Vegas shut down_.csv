"It will not end by April.Learn from China and Italy, we have seen the movie and know the script, you know how the story will play out. We are lucky that we are 2 months behind."
Nightlife is shutting down.Encore Beach Club and XS (Wynn) suspend operations
"I’d be surprised if any cities shut down, including Las Vegas."
"I received a notice today from my Olympic Club in San Francisco that twice a week buffets at all club houses will shut down. Sit down dinners only. In line with whatever Vegas is doing. I had buffet lunches at South Point just couple days ago, the BBQ was very good, meat fell off the rib, melt in your mouth type."
"""I’d be surprised if any cities shut down, including Las Vegas.""The town? Of course not. The industry 100% dependent on tourists? A pretty good possibility."
"Southpoint is a fun place. I used to stay at the Venetian for years, now I play and stay and the Southpoint, they take really good care of you there..."
I posted this on another thread but This isn’t just a couple weeks thing anymore. This will be a 2-3 month thing until everyone infected is quarantined and a cure is provided.The smaller cruise ship industry and discount airlines will hurt if not go bankrupt during this time.The world itself didn’t believe how bad it was and then let everything continue as normal for two more weeks. I’m not blaming any government but it should have been reacted to by all better.
If they can shut down New York City they can shut down pretty much anywhere.
I’m in Las Vegas right now & it’s busy/bustling as usual. It will probably get slower but I’d be shocked if Las Vegas will “shut down”.
"Good news: progress made yesterday...A research team comprising of clinical microbiologists and infectious disease specialists from Sunnybrook Hospital, McMaster University and University of Toronto has isolated the virus responsible for causing COVID-19.A release from Sunnybrook says Dr. Samira Mubareka and Dr. Rob Kozak of Sunnybrook and University of Toronto along with Dr. Arinjay Banerjee and Dr. Karen Mossman of McMaster University collaboarted to isolate the SARS-CoV-2 virus which has caused the current outbreak. It adds that they were able to “culture the virus from two clinical specimens in a Level 3 containment facility.”The isolated virus will help researchers across the world develop better testing, treatments and vaccines.https:/…"
"You realize that Disneyland is shutting down at one of it's slowest times of the year? But as of now, they will re-open in time for Easter, when business would normally pick up. They might even come out ahead financially by closing."
"so can anyone define ""shutdown"" for a city ? Easy to define shutting down Disney World,MLB etc."

"""'You realize that Disneyland is shutting down at one of it's slowest times of the year?'Not according to articles. Mid-March to Mid April are some of the busiest times at Disneyland. Don't think they are coming out ahead.""Some schools have already been on spring break, each week that goes by there's more. Disney no longer has a true slow season especially with the recent opening of the Star Wars' area. They are taking a big hit and I wouldn't count on them reopening April 1st."
"""so can anyone define ""shutdown"" for a city ? Easy to define shutting down Disney World,MLB etc.""This should help. Here in NYC there are no sports, most colleges are online now no in person classes, Broadway shut down, Carnegie Hall closed, major museums closed, no gatherings of more than 250, occupancy of restaurants cut in half.... Need I go on? If you were a tourist why come? Not worth it at this time.Most of us do expect schools to be closed shortly. Going to get worse with closures before it gets better. This is as close to a city shutting down in my opinion."
"thanks, I guess it is more a case of semantics.My son lives in Brooklyn and was scheduled to run in the half marathon this week end but that event has been cancelled."
Spain and Norway are shut downManila proper is shut downI have to guess Vegas will eventually follow
"adding, he can still leave his apt,go to work,go for a walk,take the subway,drive etc but his choices are certainly shrinking on a weekly basis.Shutting down is probably more relevant to a tourist than a resident."
The buffers in Vegas are shut down
If they shut down the schools and or close the subway then it becomes very real for us residents. This would affect us greatly. Not looking forward to the next few weeks.
how about closing the GW bridge etc....now that would be traumatic !
Hey are you there for fun? My trip is in 2 weeks wondering I should cancel ?
the meat will be falling off many bones. Las Vegas is on its way out
">>Spain and Norway are shut down, Manila proper is shut down I have to guess Vegas will eventually follow<<Id have to guess that other US cities would shout down before LV, or are you saying ""Vegas"" is just one street in a city with 2 million people living there and mean the Strip will shut down??So stange that people confuse one street for an entire metropolitan area."
I hope they shut down the Cal. Too many of our elders frequent there and would be a good deterrent for them to hop on a plane to hawaii to go play at the Cal. I know it’s home away from home but with that many elderly in one place it spells disaster I’m so sad for vegas and sad for our world right now But this too hopefully shall pass
Great point angelina1813.13
Business may slow but shut down… highly doubt it from someone living here! Rumor is they will be shutting down part the strip at night to sanitize it.
"Tourist sites around the world are shutting down, including the Louvre in Paris, Colosseum in Rome, shows in NY and London etc. But the cities themselves will plod along. Same for Vegas.Edited: 10:32 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Yes, Vegas will shut down. And when people talk about Vegas, it is understood which area they are talking about...except for GB.Edited: 10:34 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Commerce Casino in Los Angeles was open last night. Shut down tonight.
"It was announced this evening that Las Vegas is shutting down hotel by hotel as of Tuesday. MGM Grand properties will stop service starting Tue temporarily, of course due to the CV.. Very sad for many employees that now are out of work.."
It’s going down now...so sad to see
"I would guess, within several days.Best of luck,Hunt"
When will Vegas shut down? Now.
"I’d say very fast response time. 4 days. Some people complain the US is too slow or managed it badly. I’d say we have done very well in incredibly fast 4 days, mobilized the entire country, closing all schools, bars, restaurants, sporting events, concerts, shows, Broadway, all in 4 days, drastic and draconian. I have never ever seen anything like this in my lifetime. I left Las Vegas last Wednesday 3/11, before that everything was fine and busy: everything happened when I was driving away from Las Vegas. From only one case in North Las Vegas before 3/11. 4 days only, we went into action, for a country of 350 million people. How much faster do you want? How much faster can you get? We will do fine and come out okay."
"In some ways you are right Mac. It's good to see us responding. But had we had adequate testing in place weeks ago we'd have realized the threat earlier and already taken steps. The public would've been further along in being educated so the bars across America wouldn't have been packed all weekend among other things. We'd have maybe 10,000 cases next week instead of 30,000.We were too late. All of us. It's why the country will soon be shutting down for a month or two."

"5 days ago LV only had one single case, would you or anyone dare to shut down casinos, buffets and shows? Who’d dare to even suggest that in a meeting? Crazy?There are 2000 cases among 350 million people, 0.0000057. Americans are not stupid nor ignorant, as foreigners like to say about us, we were aware of covid19. If you do it a week ago, or a day sooner, people’d be complaining and say Trump is crazy. Actually things happened rapidly, one after another. All over the country, most must be done on local and state level. If anyone should’ve been building up the supply of test kits, it is that Fauci guy at CDC. President or governors don’t do that stuff, not their department, McDonalds chairman doesn’t handle buying hamburgers or fries. All in 4 days only! From calm to national emergency mobilization. In a huge 350 million people country. Impressive."
"Indeed...the delay in testing and some additional bureaucratic ( regulatory and action chain) mistakes may eventually result in a 2 - 3 month period from now before we have a solid handle on this thing.Some perhaps good news is that it appears China's case incidence has begun to fall dramatically in the past few days ( that's assuming the info is accurate). If it is accurate, and we accelerate massive and accurate testing and truly attain containment ( e.g. shutting down the Vegas Strip, for instance) here in the US, the China timeline might present a COVID-19 chronology we can somewhat count on. The ensuing warmer weather may be an aid in this situation ( that assumes this organism is similar to known respiratory viruses that don't survive well in warmer seasonality temps; we don't know if that's the case, either). One caveat will involve our health system's ability to cope with the necessary number of beds required to accommodate the most critically ill from this thing; nobody knows at this point how severe the hospitalization needs might be because we don't know how many have the infection without the testing in place. We'll see....and hope the aftermath of this situation in Vegas and elsewhere is minimized.Edited: 2:16 am, March 16, 2020 "
"@Mac..They're MOVING now, agreed. The response appears to be what it should be. I think, however, they fumbled a bit up front, some of that due to the system red tape, regulations, and simple humanity ( Fauci admitted that the system wasn't adequate to handle this situation). But most of us either under or over assumed / made mistakes with this situation, including the government agencies and Vegas tourists, as well."
"We had no testing Mac, we're only getting up to speed now. So numbers even just a week ago have no value. That's why this rise in cases in the next few weeks will be so stunning. Not because the virus is spreading that fast, but because we are weeks behind in counting. Which would be fine except that our mitigation efforts are weeks behind as a result too.Chuck you are right in that the urgent issue is beds, more specifically ventilators. Our medical system is about 2 to 3 weeks away from getting slammed. We need to slow this thing down or we're in trouble. It's why millions of people in bars, thousands travelling to Vegas is so troubling."
"It took China nearly a month to lock down. Took us 4 days. I’d say that is very impressive. You can’t do it sooner, step by step, you can’t be the wise guy to close buffet or cancel concert one day too soon. IQ vs EQ. Virus came here 2 months later, we gained 2 months, 2 months may save 10,000s lives. We watched this movie for 2 months, in China, Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, we know how it went and how it will play, we have the entire script. We are in an enviable position. If it dies out in summer as all other pandemics in human history, we gained 2 precious months. 4 days, from 3/11, super fast. I am very impressed."
"""They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax."" -dtEdited: 2:48 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Wait, yes we had two months. Two months where we did nothing. We still aren't capable of testing on the scale needed. We'll be at 30,000 cases across a huge geographical footprint and we still haven't even come close to the effort China did at that point. (Nor will we likely ever. One good thing about police state totalitarian societies, they're good at fighting viruses.)Edited: 2:52 am, March 16, 2020 "
"If you look at the patterns of community spread cropping up in the world now in the southern hemisphere and the Middle East, the hope that it's seasonal grows fainter by the day as well."

It should have happened at least a two weeks earlier except the president said it was ""Another Democratic impeachment hoax."" Fox State News also was on the it's a hoax train for at least a week after the evil MSM tried to create hysteria to hurt the president. (Or something like that.)""No I don't know anything about that.

We need two vaccines. One for COVID - 19 and the other for Trump derangement syndrome(TDS).
Now is the time to give to the Trump Foundation. They would help so much in this time of need. But I can't find an address for it?
"First of all - I agree that the casinos need to shutdown and we need to take drastic measures of social distancing. Whether it's an over-reaction or not is immaterial. It's necessary to reassure folks that the problem is being taken seriously along with aggressive action to contain.Having said that, perspective is needed and the way news channels are covering is NOT helping at all. Alot is made of the lack of available tests and we're slow. Maybe so. But people should know that the vast, vast, vast majority of people getting tested will NOT test positive for the virus. S Korea has given well over 250,000 tests (as of Mar 12) and they have 8,100 confirmed cases. That's about 3.3% positive and about 96% testing negative. This is why talking heads calling for indiscriminate testing of everyone/anyone who wants to get tested is crazy.Of course, any loss of life is tragic and we shouldn't minimize this. But listening to all-day news on this is simply not helpful because news shows have every incentive to highlight the sensational ( mortality, spread, lack of testing, slow response) and to minimalize any balanced evaluation.The best example is reporters demanding the President get tested, even though he was asymptomatic, just because he stood close to several people who later tested positive for the virus. So he got tested and tested negative. I'm not a Trump defender at all. But wouldn't you think news stations, in the interests of informing the public, would better highlight that our most high profile personality, who experienced exposure, actually still tested negative?"
MGM closed all ten of their properties in Las Vegas
It’s not good. https:/…index.html
Has Trump University closed?
It's so funny to hear all the great jokes and turning this into politics and anti-Trump. Very original guys!
"I was going to book a trip for this past weekend but, given the escalation late last week and thinking more about my responsibility as a neighbor, opted against it. Glad I did.Also, anyone attempting to defend our country's response is being partisan by definition, because objectively that is untrue. We've had tons of warning and still can't test people effectively. No excuses."
Jason's sarcasm woefully lacks originality.

I expect this week and it will mean millions in losses. Will the last one there please turn out the lights.
"South Korea's testing regimen of 24 negatives to 1 positive is the ONLY way to have a hope at mitigating it's spread short of going on full lock down for many months. It is the ONLY way we'll be able to emerge from this in under 6 months minimum. It allows experts to track it's spread and see flare ups and contain them in real time. We absolutely have to make it as widespread as possible and in particular test those not showing symptoms. It's our only chance to get ahead of this. For example did you know in South Korea 30% of all cases are aged 20-29? Many didn't even know it. In countries doing fewer testing it's well under 10%. Which obviously is not accurate. While being a symptomatic is great for them, they will spread it like crazy. Not in South Korea.Mass testing before symptoms also allows high risk earlier treatment, makes them less likely to need a scarce hospital bed, less likely to die. It's why SK's deaths are 66 and Italy, who is not testing extensively has over 1000 even though they are a few weeks behind in the start of this.The ONLY way we have a shot at avoiding a months and months long lock down is massive testing, 50,000 a day, 100,000 even. And for those who question the tens of billions of dollars in costs, that's a drop in the bucket versus if we don't.Edited: 1:08 am, March 17, 2020 "
"It’s tacky of Caesars group, the Sands and the few other other hotels to keep their properties open. The state should have mandated the closure of casinos as did other states. Kudos to Wynn and MGM for not capitalizing on a world wide pandemic. I’ll be staying at one of those properties on my next visit."
