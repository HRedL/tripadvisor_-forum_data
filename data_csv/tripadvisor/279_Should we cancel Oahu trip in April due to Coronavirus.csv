"Hello friends, We have reservations for Oahu trip in APRIL. Should we cancel the trip due to coronavirus. We are travelling with kids. I am confused. Are people cancelling trips?Thanks.."
"Only YOU can decide what is best for you.Yes, people are canceling--and no, people are not cancelling.So you should consider what cancelling means for you and your family. Do you have a chance of getting COVID-19 in Hawaii? Sure, but probably less of one than getting it back home before April.Are any of you in the high risk categories? Do you have insurance for all of your costs, or are your reservations cancellable for no or little fees?Will you be able to enjoy your trip, or be worried the whole time?Edited: 2:52 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Hi! We have plans to travel to Maui with our 2 kids starting March 28th. We are not in the high risk category. At this point-the risk is higher for us catching it in our home state! We live in WA state but are on the far east side of the state. Our flight does not go through Seattle.I'm paying close attention to recommendations from the WHO and CDC...currently there are no travel advisories for domestic travel. In fact, they do not recommend canceling travel unless it's to China, Iran, or South Korea. Level 2 advisories exist for Italy. Unless there is a widespread outbreak in Maui or in my own community we plan to travel. The fact is....this is a new virus and it acts like all viruses. Most of us will get a cold from it. There is a certain part of the global population that dies from it. That's how viruses catch our attention-we notice them because vulnerable people start dying from it. That sounds insensitive but that just how it works. The media is sensationalizing it by making every new case and death ""breaking news"" and acting like there is something we can do to prevent it. The testing snafu is regrettable-but then again...it's a brand-new viral strain-it not like they had kits stock piled."
"I have a trip for somewhere else planned for late May, normally we’d have a Kauai trip planned. It’s not visiting Hawaii that would have me concerned but the flight. My plan right now is to wait and see how this progresses or hopefully regresses. I have another road trip booked ( just hotels) that can be completely canceled just in case I don’t want to fly by May because we have no idea how this will play out. No one can tell you what to do, you have to go with what you’re comfortable with. If you’re staying in hotels that can be canceled I’d wait and see. It gets more complicated if you’re staying in a condo and final payment is due. Book and plan another vacation that doesn’t require a flight In case you do cancel. Even if it’s just a few days. That way you won’t be so bummed if you miss your Hawaii trip."
"What ANick4SW said.I have multiple trips booked, March, April & May. Next week I fly to Hilo, Big Island, and I have no concerns due to the route originating and going through essentially non-COVID19 territory and only a single confirmed case in the state of Hawaii on a different island. That is within my personal comfort zone. I figure I'm more likely to get in a car accident than get sick from the virus. No underlying health issues.The April trip is to a north European city with 29 known cases, the May trip to a different north European city with no known cases. I am watching the news closely and will follow travel advisories.These are my own assessments, totally unscientific and might be the wrong approach, or might be pretty okay. You must decide for yourself."
"It's completely up to you. We don't know what is best for you and your family ... I'm heading to Oahu in late April ... and I'm just waiting to see how the situation evolves.Edited: 5:31 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"It's of course up to you. We have zero familiarity with your particulars or comfort zone and even if we did, we can't make the call. But since you want opinions: no, you shouldn't cancel your trip. You're routinely exposed to all manner of viruses in your daily life and are presumably not worrying about that. Flying in general is a roll of the dice when it comes to exposure. That's reality. But again, you booked this trip, so you accept the incubator factor of air travel.I grant that trip planning right now is more challenging, given the hyper-focus on this outbreak. Which isn't to say the events don't warrant coverage, in context. But do keep it all in context as you make the decision that's best for your family. ~ ColleenEdited: 5:56 pm, March 07, 2020 "
People need to decide this for themselves. No one can gauge other people's level of comfort in a situation like this.Unless they close SeaTac I will continue with the vacation trip I have planned in two weeks (not Hawaii but Mexico). suze
"Well I think that soon (if not already) it won't be a question of where you are traveling, but of your underlying risk - which is a composite of your age, your general health, and your behavior.Why? Because there are cases now emerging all over the world, and it is likely that most countries have hundreds of undiagnosed cases by now. The cases hitting the news today caught it probably a week or two weeks ago AND have actually bothered to get tested.With that said it's important to remember that people who aren't elderly or immuno compromised and who behave sensibly (wash your hands, don't touch your face etc.) will be no more at risk when traveling than when going to work or meeting friends back home.Coronavirus is not ebola or some other horrible plague and if you are healthy catching it usually means having mild flue symptoms with home recovery. I am personally not cancelling my upcoming trips (unless CDC will tell me to). And I know I will enjoy myself. But you need to find out what your comfort level is and decide for yourself and your family."
We leave in 12 days and have no intentions of cancelling. No one but you can determine what's best
"i think you should go.don't cancel. now if you were going abroad to another country, i'd consider cancelling. it's kinda messed up, but i know people who work in hospitals in the healthcare industry, they were told they will require self quarantine for 14 days (meaning they cant comeback to work immediately to work in the hospital) if they are traveling abroad to another country even in countries that are not banned by the cdc. but the people traveling within the United states won't require those self quarantine rules. i mean, that absolutely doesn't make sense."
It is up to you to decide.If I was booked to go in April I would still go.
"Would you book this or any trip starting today, or not? I think 'not'. This virus will spread worldwide. Medical facilities will be overwhelmed. One reason for discouraging travel is to slow the spread while providers re-group. The virus can be fatal to the elderly and people with compromised immune systems. Younger people who contract it will likely feel 'flu-ey'. I don't want to travel with the flu -- or help spread this virus."
"I kinda fall in line with ChiSue on this. I originally was planning a return to Hawaii in April. I held off booking so I could see what happens with covid 19. At this point, I’ve decide not to book a trip at this time. I don’t want to be on an airplane for an extended time nor do I want to be among large groups of people at restaurants and elevators and stores, etc, if I don’t have to. My sense is we’re at the tip of an iceberg and things are likely to get worse before they get better. So increase my risk if I don’t need to. And by not going, like ChiSue said, I reduce chances of unwittingly spreading the virus further. Others can come to their own decisions on what they feel is right for them.Edited: 7:25 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Do you listen to the briefings all over the television on every channel 8 or 10 times a day ? What makes you think anyone on this internet website has better information that those people ?You know there is a bunch of regular flu going around too don't you ? You know that I think about 18,000 people have died from that too don't you ? Would you stay home because of that flu ?Edited: 7:38 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"I wouldn't not get a flu shot every year. We got flu on our 10th anniversary, were sick 2 weeks. Since then maybe got light flu 4 times in 30 years with shot. A lot depends on how old you are and if you have lung, heart, or other problems."
"Second case now......though they haven't said what island. They have to play hide the football and do a press conference about it.I haven't had the flu for at least 30 years. Guess I just have a good immune system (actually, I KNOW I do!)."
"Evidently both of you and your kids are fairly young!Deaths seem to be occurring by this virus within the elderly and within those with a suppressed immune system.I'm not recommending that you go ahead with your plans, nor am I recommending that you cancel your plans.Totally up to you!"
Second case is an Oahu resident. He went to Washington and brought it home........
pb!I see your point! Odds of getting the flu on a trip (or even in your home town) are much greater than getting Coronavirus.Odds of dying if you get Coronavirus is much worse than if you contract the flu. Odds of contracting Coronavirus right now is far less than contracting the flu! So kind of a wash!
"Without naming names, how is it possible to blame a predecessor for his/her response to a virus that did not even exist then?I'm not a rocket scientist! But seems to me that no tests can be conducted and no immunization can be manufactured to combat a virus that did not exist even a year ago! Stevie Wonder can see this!Oops! While I did not name names, perhaps this link almost, kind of, does! Mea Culpa!https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-…"
"dusty we really don't know what the odds of dying are if you get coronavirus since up until now they have not had the means to test people for it. They say that far and away the majority of people who catch it have very weak cases and in some cases show no symptoms at all. So, the 2 or 3% number of people that die that gets mentioned is probably much higher that it really is."
"I have thought the same thing about mortality rates overall. Although, they do also say the mortality rate increases with age. So for me personally, I'd prefer to avoid exposure as much as possible to limit my risk. I'd rather not contract the virus (if possible) than contract it by taking unnecessary risks and then hope I'm not one of the unlucky one's. Or if my symptoms are so mild, I or my child unknowingly pass it on to an elderly parent, neighbor or friend. The other thing that really puzzles me, is if the impact is really so mild and as some say not even as bad as the flu, then why are governments reacting so severely ? I know of no government that would readily put their entire economy at risk and quarantine millions of people over the flu. Or block air travel because of a flu outbreak. The fact that governments are willing to take such drastic measures makes me think there is possibly more to this than is being told to the public. Anyway, I know what the right decisions are for myself. And I respect that for each person their assessment of the situation and the risks may be different."
"Italy's fatality rate (about 3%) appears to be similar to that reported by China. The fatality rate for typical flu is around .01%. In both cases, people that have mild cases, particularly younger people, never see a doctor and are not tested so are not included in the numbers.Unfortunately, without a vaccine and without treatments like Tamiflu, coronavirus has the potential for some really negative outcomes if it becomes widespread.Edited: 12:00 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Perhaps the flu death rate is .1% rather than .01%? Either way, much lower."
"The rapid rate of infections--and the asymptomatic people who are spreading it unknowingly for _____ days are a large part of the issue with COVID-19.Look at the case rates--not just China's, but Korea's and Italy's. Case number doubling in a day or two, areas of infection expanding easily and seemingly without stopping. China had *some* success because it *did limit travel, contact, etc.* earlier than other countries. Italy's closure of the North is HUGE......can people not see that?Yes, the US is in for an ugly ride. Anyone who thinks otherwise at this point is truly in denial. There are at least 9 vaccines that have been submitted for testing.....but none will be available until *maybe* 2021. I think the man who is the second case (on Oahu) is likely to die. He has been referred to as ""critically ill"" too many times already. How many people he infected is a mystery."
"It's so sad that certain people of a certain political persuasion continue to argue this is no big deal. I simply cannot believe people are so propagandized and so desperate to believe ""their side is right"" that they cannot see the evidence in front of their own eyes. There is no containment in the US. There are not enough tests. The last two months have been squandered by people who don't believe in science and experts, people who have been able to gaslight and lie their way out of past crises and believed their own lies (""a travel ban from China will save us""). You cannot gaslight a virus. You have to prepare, and that hasn't happened. People saying ""did you know flu killed 18,000..."" Well Covid is going to kill a lot more people that that in the US. People need to start really looking at this and understanding that this a slow moving catastrophe, and not only is it a failure of leadership and our political culture, its a failure of imagination and being able to comprehend what is going to happen next. And all people need to do is to look to the countries that were earlier than us to understand what is coming next - China, Iran, Italy. For example on Feb 25th I started posting on a different site in response to ""should I go to Italy in March."" I literally could not believe people were asking this, and basically compared the situation in Wuhan to Italy and said all you need to do is compare the numbers day by day from when there were 11 cases in Wuhan vs 11 cases in Italy ... and then fast forward X days and then ask would I have gone to Wuhan when there were 233 dead or whatever? And 10 days later there were 1000+ dead? I was roundly criticized, told I was panic mongering, told that the West will be different. But guess what, sure enough, the numbers are very similar day to day between Wuhan and Italy. Which means Italy today is (at best) 8 days from cracking 1,000 dead and about two and half weeks away from 3,000 dead. But you will actually start to see a difference soon. Because Italy is not China. Italy is not conscripting medical workers. Italy is not implementing draconian quarantines. Italy is not building 1000 bed hospitals in one week. Italy is not using the power of a surveillance state to force compliance with the experts' plans. And so where Wuhan started leveling off even before the 3000 mark, Italy's death toll will get higher and higher. In fact today we started reading the first stories of ICU beds being at capacity. Hmm, wonder what will happen next with the death rate? And now let's look at PNW and California. These are going to be the new centers of the outbreak, but, again, the clock has been rewound by several weeks. These are the places where there are ""only"" 11 deaths or whatever. But again, the trend will be the same over time, because for every death depending on what you number you want to use, there are between 50-500 non-fatal cases, and those people are running around infecting other people. Today. Right now. As we speak. And nothing is being done to contain those people. Seatac is still open. Lax is still open. People are still flying to every corner of the country infecting others. Truckers are still transiting contagion zones and bringing the virus to small little towns. Schools and universities have not been shut down and events banned in a universal way. After all this is an overreaction, a hoax. Iran must have just released 1/3 of its prison population to embarrass Trump, right? Israel must be ""hysterical"" for announcing ANYONE entering the country from abroad is subject to a mandatory 14 day quarantine. They hate our Grate Leedurr after all. And Bulgaria must have just canceled every single school in the country, banned events, implemented health 100% health checks at borders etc to try and make Trump look bad.Edited: 2:27 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"According to the Hawaii State Health Department press conference yesterday, there are 2 confirmed cases in Hawaii. Both came from exposure in Washington State There are no cases here where the virus was caught in Hawaii. That said, it certainly is up to the individual when and where to travel."
"I am in a same boat as you. Our trip is April 1-7. But nobody can really decide for you or me in this case. I am not worried about the virus, we have had worse with H1N1 when hundreds of thousands died throughout US and nobody overhyped about it then. I don’t know what political game this is and we will probably never know. That being said, if you are not immunocompromised, I would still go. The only worry I have at this point is being placed on quarantine God forbid someone on a plane comes up with symptoms. Other than that, go and enjoy. And I will too."
"""we have had worse with H1N1 when hundreds of thousands died throughout US and nobody overhyped about it then""12,469 people died in the US in the H1N1 pandemic you are referring to. It must be strange to live in an alternate universe full of fake facts. Again, repressive regimes would not be releasing 1/3 of their prisoners and modern countries like Israel - not prone to overreaction - would not be quarantining every single person entering the country because of an ""overhyped"" illness. https:/…2009-h1n1-pandemic.htmlEdited: 3:53 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"No one knows how many cases are in Hawaii at this point. I know the gubbermint says 2......and I know that isn't realistic.I know medical people (yes, *real* ones) who believe we have multiple cases on Maui. Problem is the DOH won't accept tests. Yes, I know the criteria is supposed to have changed. No, it hasn't. I don't know medical people on the other major islands.......but I bet any honest one would say the same as the ones I know on Maui."
"Hilarious all the pots calling kettles black.I have a trip scheduled for the 4th week of April and as long as planes are flying I'll be coming. This is a business trip, but I would come for vacation too, if that was what the trip was for.I'd ignore any ""I know a guy"" anecdotes OP."
"Corona del Mar is a better starting point than some places on the East Coast. And maybe you are younger than the chancellors, or healthier.Plus, the planes are flying part means it is not that bad pandemically in the US. Good hedge.Edited: 8:00 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Scott--or should I say""Dr. Scott"".......so why would I believe you more than doctors I know personally?Huh. Funny how the other side looks different.I'm sure nothing will happen, no one will die, and tourism will be just WONDERFUL.Right."
"We're only as good as the info we get that fits our own narrative or agenda. We believe what we want and everyone else is either wrong or everyone is an Internet expert. Most of us ""know people"" who we will choose to believe. That brings it all back to the premise that one will need to do what is best for them and what is ""real"" around their own reality. One thing I know for sure is I will do my own research, pay attention to what comes out of the CDC, prepare for the worst, pray for the best and not rely on some travel forum to make my mind up for me."

"I am very confused with all the information, or sometimes lack of.I have a trip planned for 2 weeks at Kona from the end of April.I am a fit, healthy, middle age person....so to that side not necessarily at risk.The problem is I have a hectic journey to actually get to Hawaii from South Africa, and that is worrying me?Cape Town to Amsterdam to LAX to Kona.Lots of flying :-/Our first week we will be self catering, so I am also worried to arrive in a strange country then find the shops empty or something.Not really sure what to do, as I really didn't want to cancel, bit am concerned about maybe getting stuck there, or elsewhere along the route?Any advice welcome!"
"I wish someone could tell you......but in all honesty, no one knows. I think you will have to decide what your risk tolerance is--and go by that. By the end of April, things could be better...or worse, anywhere along your route or there at home for you, too."
"It is March 10. A lot more news and information is sure to come out over the next 3-4 weeks before you travel. Monitor reliable sources of news and if you feel you prefer to cancel, take advantage of “extraordinary circumstances” special allowances by airlines/hotels/etc. These pop up with short windows, so a lot can happen between today and your travel dates."

"Must be nice to know everything. For reference, LAX gets 240,000 passengers a day from every corner of the world. Could it become a problem, sure, but it is not now"
"I'll give you my two cents, for what it's worth. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the flu infects up to 45 million people every year, and kills 290,000 to 650,000. That half a million number is not the number infected. That's the number who actually DIE from flu. Every year. Coronavirus numbers are a drop in the bucket compared to flu - 120k cases globally. The great majority are in China. If you do get it, most cases are mild, just like flu. It's not some boogeyman disease that's particularly deadly if you're unfortunate enough to get it. Most people have a mild illness and get well, and some very small percentage end up hospitalized, or have serious problems up to and including death. Same as with flu. Caveat. Clearly there are vulnerable people in the population who would be particularly susceptible and should take extra precautions. I'm not referring to that. (Kids don't seem to be among those particularly vulnerable, by the way). But, right now, panic is setting in among the general population. Airliners are canceling flights. The stock market dropped 2000 points. You can't find a surgical mask in the United States. People are fighting over bottled water at Costco. If we are this concerned about Corona, why aren't we more concerned about flu? No one was canceling flights because flu season arrived, and that's demonstrably worse. Far worse. You can't make that make sense, given the facts. It's simple fear. So while each person must assess his or her own risk tolerance, personally, I just booked my trip for April and as long as the planes are flying, I'll be going."
"I'm sorry....but you typed way wrong death numbers. Like grossly wrong.The *estimate is between 12,000 and 61,000*. Here's the CDC's info:https:/…index.html"
"AkamaiNick4SW - No, it's you who is wrong. Let's think about this. CDC = United States. WHO - The World Health Organization. Ahem. *World*Now you see where you went wrong?"
"Well, you are talking about Hawaii and coming from ""USA"". So I think CDC numbers and totals mean much more for most people than world ones. But sure, you can use the world totals........just make sure that when the COVID-19 is all said and done, you use the same standards :-).People all have to make their own choices and decisions. They should base them on their own risk tolerance, their own financial and personal situation, and their family and extended family situation.Let me just throw another number out there, for you and others. New York had 2 confirmed cases a week ago (just like Hawaii). It had 173 by noon today."
AkamaiNick4SW - Your first reply to my original post is so misleading that it should be edited or deleted as a public service. The facts are exactly as I stated them.
"Ideas8: so you are just assuming that the exponential transmission example 4SW gave just means all those folks will have mild symptoms. Again have they closed down universities, events, and public schools for the flu in your recent memory and advised ppl to observe a “social distance?”"
"#49. *(Kids don't seem to be among those particularly vulnerable, by the way).*What does this even mean? That we should only panic if kids fall deathly ill and/or die? That old people dying is no cause for concern?*flu infects up to 45 million people every year, and kills 290,000 to 650,000. That half a million number is not the number infected. That's the number who actually DIE from flu. Every year. Coronavirus numbers are a drop in the bucket compared to flu*Careless thinking. No one knows what COVID19 will result in “every year.” We are just over two months in at this point. Comparing annual estimates for influenza derived from data amassed over many years to numbers collected in a non-standardized manner for a newly emerging, barely understood infectious disease is misleading.*If you do get it, most cases are mild, just like flu. It's not some boogeyman disease that's particularly deadly if you're unfortunate enough to get it. Most people have a mild illness and get well, and some very small percentage end up hospitalized, or have serious problems up to and including death. Same as with flu.*About 1% of influenza patients are hospitalized or die. Estimates for COVID19 are 20%. So not “a very small percentage” by any measure and certainly not “same as the flu."""
">>>About 1% of influenza patients are hospitalized or die. Estimates for COVID19 are 20%.

The 3.5% is a subset of the 20%. This laser focus on death being the only bad outcome of COVID19 is dangerous."
"The inflection point at which exponential contagion slows depends on number of contacts and infection probability. So social distancing and hygiene matter a LOT to the world, not just a vacation or job or industry. 500,000 people or 50,000 infected? Individual choices will determine that. Probably 1 in 1000 will watch this, but the last 30 seconds says it all.https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg"

Yes, I will certainly try to the some money back, but if I can’t then, I can’t. Of course, I am sad about this, but I would be a lot sadder if a loved one or friend dies because of my trip.I want to reschedule my trip to August, but I will hold off until I know for sure if that will work. Do the right thing, everyone."
"Look how fast the virus is moving in the US. It is being spread to every community, first via Travel, then via community spread. Those who say ""I'm just going to keep on living my life"" ""My vacation is too important"" are in for a rude awaking and are unwittingly expanding the growing problem.Comparisons to the Flu are silly. Do you know of ANY government that would risk severe damage to their economy for the Flu ? The fact that we've watched a domino effect of governments taking steps that damage their economy's is pretty clear evidence that there is more to this virus than the Flu. Soon you will see it in the US also. Our government has soft-shoed it's message and response in hopes ""washing hands"" and ""social distancing"" might contain it while not harming the economy. It hasn't. Expect more severe restrictions coming in the next month as they realize more needs to be done. New York has it's first containment zone around a city. It's still a weak measure. Soon I expect Seattle will start a more significant crack down. Like I mentioned in a different post, the guy in Seattle who was having symptoms but still decided he'd prefer to fly home to Hawaii rather than go to a hospital in Seattle was still ""living his life"". Now he's in the hospital in Hawaii and I wonder if those people who were sitting around him on the flight to Hawaii are still happy with their choice.Edited: 2:36 pm, March 11, 2020 "
A similar post on social distancing was removed as not meeting TA guidelines. The world is watching.
"Honu, you can-and should--write TA and ask for the thread to be reinstated.It was clearly travel related. In defense of the man who came back to Oahu: Many, many elderly people want to die at home. They don't want to die thousands of miles away, in a strange hospital, far from friends or maybe other family. I suspect the Kupuna in this case is one of them. He hasn't died yet (that we know about)...but I think his chances are very poor for survival based on what has been published."
"The scramble now is to “flatten the curve” so that Pieces of the virus don’t outpaced the capacity of the healthcare system. China didn’t have that luxury. In order to care for coronaviruses, and try to convey contain the virus, they had to sacrifice care for other patients. So even if you think that you’re in good health and could survive the virus, and have few high-risk people you could contaminate, you need to consider the prospect the hospitals are jammed with coronavirus patients there may not be here for your kid with appendicitis, or your coworker with a workplace injury.Edited: 4:10 pm, March 11, 2020 "

"I have decided to cancel.Although I am young, fit and healthy, the 45 hour journey over 3 flights is too risky.The way this thing seems to work is I could catch it and not even know...then take a series of 6 flights there and back to South Africa, and maybe infect people.KLM are offering free flight changes. My accommodationhave been awesome and fully refunded ...so I plan to visit when all is well again.It's a long way for me to come,and probably the only time I will visit so saving it for a better time."
"I think that is a very good choice DiscoverNamibia. For you, others and your community. If everyone else would start making that same choice it would help. It is a global problem at this point."
"Definitely agree that it's the right choice, Discover_Namibia (which I'd like to some day, btw!). And given that flights from Europe to the US are cancelled for 30 days, this may have been your reality anyway. Gotta say that while I do well with air travel, I can not fathom spending 45 hours traveling for a two week vacation. Maybe when you reschedule you'll be able to stay longer. That'd be an added bonus!~ Colleen"
"Yes Trumps new rule wouldn't have caused an effect as I leave outside the 30 days....but who is to say that doesn't get extended.I made the decision before that announcement, but it just reconfirms my decision.I stayed up late to watch his speech.Now I better sleep!!!I operate a safari company in Namibia, we have no cases.Most of my guests still want to travel, but many are from the US, and get here via Europe.....so tomorrow could be a busy day for me!!"
"I'm glad you canceled. When you reschedule, try to stay a month. That way you will have time to visit several islands."
Wonder if OP decided to cancel or not
"""Wonder if OP decided to cancel or not.""If not, s/he'd do well not to share here, given the derision levied at those traveling. ~ Colleen"
"Why so judgmental of everyone, Colleen? People have their own opinions and are allowed to post them. You have criticized so many posts since starting to post again. I find it unpleasant, and feel like you enjoy ""correcting"" people. Not travel related and casts a pall over threads and other posters, IMO. Whether another's style is to your liking or not has no bearing....unless TA has made you a moderator and changed the guidelines."
Social distancing and hygiene are the tools we have to flatten the curve and slow the contagion.Every person matters.https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg
"thank you for deciding to consider the greater good (6 flights!) and possibility of harming others over your initial plans. the beaches in mauritius are much closer to you and they have gorgeous hotels, maybe you can recoup your plans there and visit hawaii another time."
"Hi! April sounds a bit risky. I travel a lot with my work, and I decided not to go anywhere during this month and April, later I will see what to do. I decided to do such not to risk my health and/or the other people's health. Plus airplane is a public place, and who knows what the other passengers have done or where they have been... I would prefer staying home for now"
"Please don't travel unless you must. It's not *you*. You may be 'inconvenienced' -- possibly with a mild case of flu and possibly by getting stuck somewhere 'there' or at home. By traveling *anywhere* unnecessarily you are helping spread this virus, which is making people seriously ill and KILLING others."
Every choice for the greater good matters.Thank you for doing your part for social distancing and containment.
I’m glad you had good success with cancelling your vaca. Unfortunately we booked ours through Time Design International Pte. Ltd. and they will not let us cancel without losing all of our money. Very disappointing considering the situation we are in with this virus.
"I just cancelled a trip scheduled for next week to Canada. Really bummed, but it is for the greater good. Also, I was worried another travel ban would happen while I'm there."
Thanks for your good choice to #bendthecurve
"Hello everyone, we too are scheduled to fly out of Seattle on the 23rd and return on the 29th of March. Am I worried, yes but more of the panic in people and how they are acting. In WA our stores shelves are bare, how will it be in Honolulu? that worries me! I would rather not go, because of the store issue, and because I do not want to get stuck there or have to be sent to quarantine once I return missing more work. These are the things that worry me, honestly I think the airports and the airplanes are probably the safest place to be right now. Persons are smart...people are crazy, panic and fear causes chaos and anxiety.I think you should really think about all things and then make a decision based on your own circumstance. For us...we are boarding that plane...and hopefully will not have to pay 20 x for something because of this virus."
"Suppose to leave from Nova Scotia on the 20TH of march to ohau, should we go? Not sure what to do?"
"Stay put, help #bendthecurve of exponential contagion. People's actions matter to the global community. People who never feel very sick can infect others. Move the virus around."
We are planned to visit Oahu for 5 days on May 16th and Maui for 4 days starting on May 20th.We have to make the final payment on one of bookings next week and can still cancel with 100% refund. We are leaning toward canceling due to if we get symptoms and cant fly home for 4 or 6 weeks and dont want to be in that position.
"MarthaB: "" honestly I think the airports and the airplanes are probably the safest place to be right now.""I can think of 100 other places that are safer than an airplane. Reread what our governor said about WA residents and travel. We are at the epicenter here. Also, check the threads on this forum. Residents of HI are weighing in and reporting what they are seeing. I'd listen to them.Edited: 1:56 pm, March 13, 2020 "
please keep us posted. I am very curious to know how everyone in Hawaii are dealing with this challenge. I have a trip coming up in Mid April
"Another reason to cancel is what if you are exposed on the way home, feel just fine, never get very sick but infect others before you get sick. Or get exposed on vacation, spread it to folks on the plane who then spread ot to others..."
"PLease, please........reconsider any travel. Not just to Hawaii, but ANY travel. Look at the rising curve of cases; look at the history of this virus in China, Italy, Singapore, Korea.....and then consider what the US has and hasn't done.For whatever reasons (not to start a war or another war).....the US is horribly far behind and we WILL pay the price. Look at the videos with Dr. Fauci.We have shortages here, have for over a month. Most things get restocked in a few days or a week, as shipments arrive. But some are out of stock and back ordered for over a month already. More will run out and *stay* gone as this goes on."
But it's not just about whether or not you have any underlying health risks. It's about spreading it to people who have compromised immune systems or are otherwise vulnerable.
"I'm in an at risk group due to age and certain medical problems. I have a trip planned to Colorado in mid May to see 3 granddaughters graduate from high school. Although I haven't cancelled yet, I'm giving it to mid April, it looks like at this point I won't be going. Not only because Of the airplane travel, airports etc but because I don't want to end up sick thousands of miles from home I also don't want to take the chance of making any family members sick.Things are getting cancelled here just like the mainland. I imagine more will come. I just got home from Wal-Mart and there is no hand sanitizer nor rubbing alcohol. None in the grocery stores either. No disinfecting cleaners but there were a few hand wipes left and of course limits on what you can buy. Although we don't have any cases here on Kauai, it's only a matter of time. It is a bit unnerving reading how many folks still want to come from other states that the virus is exploding in. That said, it's your vacation, just make sure you can live with the decision you make. It effects everyone you come in contact with."
"Fish diva my post following yours wasn’t meant directly at you, it just posted at the same time you posted yours.Edited: 3:57 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"We are booked to go in May and it is only that our travel insurance wont cover anything of our holiday impacted by Covid 19 , including being quarantined,which would put us serious financial pain, should the unlikely occur. If I was a US citizen at this stage I would still be comfortable in going."
"Our flight to Europe was canceled so we booked a flight to Oahu for next week. Just exercise extra precautions. Build up your immune system. The chances of me getting it from work or from public places at home is higher. I plan to bot not worry about it and just enjoy my vacation.Edited: 6:36 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"I wish you would consider that you may well be, or become- asymptomatic and therefore unknowingly infect others."
I am also travelling to Oahu in April but my biggest concern is the two-week self quarantine you have to do when you get back home.. that's an additional two weeks not at work. ???
"We are devastated to have today cancelled our annual trip for the Hapalua - thankfully Hawaiian Airlines are offering a refund, that is, when we can get through as expected lines are full. Accommodation is not so easy to cancel - only accept a change in dates. As our Australian Government has issued a level 3 (2nd highest) travel warning for ONLY essential travel, we have no choice. Feeling sad for all the tourism outlets in Hawaii - always perfect for our visits. Stay well and virus free."
I know I'll probably get torn apart on here but I have a trip in the middle of May to Oahu from California and I plan on going as long as the plane takes off.
"People stay home! We need to all pull together to defeat this virus. Non essential travel, means NO travel for vacations."
"But Brenda, how can we pull together when we are exercising our right to ""do what's right for ME?"""
"For me it's nothing about pulling together or the greater good of the people. Sorry.I just don't think it would be a very pleasant time to travel right now. Hard to have a ""fun"" vacation with so much tension and anxiety everywhere.I find people preaching and on their high horse on these forums just as annoying as those who are determined to travel regardless of good information advising to the contrary.Edited: 9:22 pm, March 14, 2020 "

"We just canceled our trip to Honolulu because we were afraid there would be domestic travel restrictions to and from Washington state. We had a very unpleasant experience with our VRBO rental that I wanted to share. We had paid a deposit to the property managers Turnkey and while there was no cancelation policy posted on VRBO or in the rental agreement, and we gave them 30 days notice, they refused to refund our $523 deposit. I thought at least they would transfer the payment to a future rental, but no negotiation possible. You might want to think about the cost of not going. Airline was no problem-completely refunded."

Washington is a hot spot for the virus. That’s where you live. So why in the world would you want to bring your pilau okole to our island to possibly infect us. That’s ignorant. I wondered who still took a vacation during the outbreak. Now we know. Selfish is all I can say.
Yes cancel your trip. The virus only gets here to island if someone brings it. Our Kupuna are in danger because of people vacationing here in the middle of a pandemic.
@CelesteW: post #106 is directed at which Seattlite? The 3 recent posts from Seattle are to say we are NOT coming.
"We just got backfrom visiting Oahu in March and now both of us are in self isolation.I contracted a flu like virus while there, sore throat, cough, fever, chills, and diarrohea.On return to Australia, no GP would see me, instead had to attend the local hospital COVID 19 clinic for testing, and as a result are locked up in my house for 7 days, until result comes back. Both of us by the fact my husband was in close proximity to me. Now awaiting results.My advice DON'T GO."
A new case on Oahu was just confirmed.
"my husband and I have reservations on Maui for April 15. As long as we aren't sick and flights are flying, we will be going. We are both 71 and unless things change . Only 2 sick on Oahu. We will go. Right now we figure if we postpone it will only get worse."
"And 2 on Kauai.. who were on Maui first. And no one knows how many more on all islands.Please don't come. Just don't.Edited: 2:31 am, March 15, 2020 "
"This is not just about peoples vacations. Maybe some people do not need a job, but this will devastate the Hawaiian economy. It might be necessary, not sure, but we do not want to over react, but I guess its a done deal now"
"Yes, it will devastate the economy. But it will do that regardless of when people stop traveling. The slump is already going, has been. And it will continue. This is so much larger than people see.Many locals will lose their jobs, and the surrounding waves of impact will affect many businesses and services. Foreclosure rates will rise again, and so will bankruptcy and other issues. But the least amount of deaths would be the best result......and that can only be accomplished by limiting travel."
CDC guidance keep an eye on thishttps:/…travel-in-the-us.html
"""But the least amount of deaths would be the best result......and that can only be accomplished by limiting travel.""...and massively increased testing, to add on. Social distancing is a short term (regardless of how long it's carried out) solution. People need access to testing in order to know if they're infected. That will move us toward long-term solutions, such as they are.~ Colleen"
"Absolutely, Colleen."
"Good question, my wife and I are planning to go in early April, less than three weeks. We haven't visited Oahu together (we each did it in our wilder-single days... a long time ago). But we're in our early 60's not in the typical high-risk category and if we were to get sick afterwards, we could handle the time off with sick days (for her) and an understanding boss (for me).My small concern is which sites may be closed for that time.? We've not seen the USS Arizona. Other than that, we're cool just going to the beach, driving around or just hanging by the pool. There are a couple of musical groups that I'm hoping are playing while we're there. Hopefully, their shows will not we cancelled.But... for some reason (and I normally don't do this), I did buy vacation insurance when I bought our air tickets. So, we have an emergency exit if we feel we need it."
"https:/…A fit perky traveler may do just fine even if they get the virus. Only worry is tp and paycheck, right? People on the plane, in stores and restaurants, cleaners of cars and lodging may not fare so well. But what you don't know you can't worry about.Edited: 7:41 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"You know how many people you might come into contact on any given day? That you could infect even if you feel fine when you leave your home town. From everyone in the airports to transportation, hotel staff, restaurant staff. Just those few examples and you are already in the hundreds. It might be nice that you can afford to stay longer if you get quarantined. You know it's not in a hotel on the beach right? You're small concern is the the Pearl Harbor National Memorial might be closed? My small concern is getting to see my grandkids on the mainland in the future."
"Let's all sing together:IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEEEE.There. Feel better?Now, do yourselves and everyone you would come into contact with a huge favor: cancel your trip."
"Anyone has thoughts regarding what me and the wife should do? We have a trip booked to arrive in Oahu from Australia Sydney on the 18th of May for a week and a half. We are in our early 30's and have no kids.Should we cancel, go or wait until early May to decide?"
This is for anyone no matter where in the world you live. Please stay home until further notice.
"Is there any financial benefit to cancelling earlier or later? Does the airplane have date cutoffs?Is Australia still having the self quarantine requirement on return?Honestly, I do not see any info indicating the US will be ""better"" midmay, let alone Hawaii. Cases may be peaking then."
Looks like hotels can be closed. https:/…
People better check their insurance. It may not cover if flights are cancelled by the govt.
All incoming travellers to Australia MUST self quarantine for 2 weeks. Information at incoming customs and border security (just now on TV) are introducing information to be available when boarding planes to Australia.
"Smileyrayray - Australians are being told to not take any trips that are not compulsory - ie international travel for recreation - I'd be checking with your travel insurance company smileyrayray as more then likely with this directive, you will be travelling with no insurance coverage at all. And travel to the US without any coverage is just absolute madness IMO. My take - cancel your trip! Hawaii will still be there in 6mths / 12mths / 18mths, when this panic has subsided."
"As I posted, Hawaiian is cancelling flights to/from both Australia and New Zealand."
Should we cancel our trip to Oahu in April?
We fully expect to cancel our June trip from DC.

We are scheduled to go April 3-12. was wondering same thing. I am also a nurse and understand the virus. To each his/her own. We are healthy and will be going unless domestic flights are grounded. Have a great time!!
"This post is why government has to take measures like bans to save people from people. To each their own, but not when it affects many others .You just have a great time."
"Sandra C, yes--for your sake and others, please cancel.To ""nurse"".......if you were professional, you would never be so reckless and negligent. We don't want your germs, whether you know you have them or not. Stay home."
I am supposed to go to Maui on Saturday. I really need help deciding if I should cancel. Is it completely stupid to go right now?
"Yes, IMO it is very stupid to come to Maui now."
"Nurse, Hawaii has a nursing shortage, if you insist on coming stop by the hospital(s) and help out instead of sitting on a beach with little services for you."
I was the OP on the original thread (that eventually got closed) about whether to cancel our trip. Seems like a lifetime ago that we were agonizing over the decision.I understand the how hard it can be to cancel a vacation that you’re financially and emotionally vested in. And I also think that at this point it would be absurd for anyone to still consider going. There shouldn’t be a decision point now. Health officials and government officials at all levels of government are actually aligned (first time in how many years?) with the same message that you should stay at home. Hoping folks decide to show solidarity with the rest of the country by staying home and trying not to turn the USA into the next Italy.
"Clucker7, very well said. Thank you. Stay safe and healthy!"
"If you have symptoms or have been in contact with anyone who had symptoms, please stay home. Historically Hawaii has been infected, killing thousands when visitors brought disease to our shores. If you, however, are asymptomatic, have had no contact, then please do come. Everyone should worry more about bringing Covid TO US than getting it FROM US. Airlines, restaurants, hotels are taking the utmost precautions to protect you and your vacation. Once more, you will be outdoors, a good thing, and most activities and restaurants are open-air."
Have you not seen the latest closure list on Oahu? They are following the latest CDC recommendations. The best thing for everyone involved is to stay home and not travel. Ironic that the meeting that was to be held yesterday to discuss how to help visitors out that contact the virus on Oahu was cancelled due to social distancing. One thing for sure you get the virus on Oahu you will be quarantined in a certain building that's not going to be in an hotel or near the beach.
"{If you, however, are asymptomatic, have had no contact, then please do come.} Penny, Not a good first post :( That makes no sense and is NOT the advice being given from anywhere. Actually this is the one and only place I have read travel being encouraged. Not good! You do no one any favors posting like that. Of course everyone is ""asymptomatic""... until they are not.As far as restaurants taking precautions, here in Seattle they are all closed as of yesterday. I would expect the same to continue to happen in other locations.Encouraging people to come is irresponsible."
"I bet Penny owns a condo.NO, being asymptomatic means zip. That is (as said thousands of times) one of the biggest reasons this keeps spreading.Please don't be irresponsible and rec that people travel. You are endangering them, residents, and those with whom they have contact throughout their journey.In less than a week, the State went from 2 confirmed cases to 10. This is not a joke."
"Should we cancel our trip to the islands, we're going April 4 till the 11th"
"Yes, you should. Thanks for being responsible."
"Kit. No one can tell you what to do. But yes I would cancel any travel at least for another few months. Myself, I would have been in Mexico March 24th for 10 days on my usual spring trip, but pulled the plug on that idea. It's not only about keeping people healthy, things are going to continue to be closed, events cancelled, etc. so not really a ""fun"" time to vacation even if you could pull it off without endangering yourself or others. Sincerely, suze"
"“ In less than a week, the State went from 2 confirmed cases to 10. This is not a joke.”And we’d probably have more confirmed if we actually had had any tests up until the last few days. It’s definitely here, even if the “official” numbers are low compared to other places."
"Absolutely, Analise.......I've been saying that since this started."
"So when we're comparing our nation to those that ""had plenty of test kits"" Dr. Brix (corona virus coordinator) said today that not all tests are created equal.  “other tests that were used around the world were not of the same quality” as the ones that are being deployed in the U.S., and that have been approved by the FDA for use by private labs. These provided more false positives and false results than the tests that will be in use in the U.S., she said, leading to potentially inaccurate data."""
And at least 2 more cases on Oahu that will be confirmed very soon:https:/…
"Yes! For your safety and ours (peeps on the island). There are many things closed, it would not be a fun time."
"Here's an update from Hawaii News Now. Note that they are asking restaurants to go to take out only, bars and clubs to close, and tours to reconsider:https:/…They are also asking TOURISTS TO NOT COME TO HAWAII FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS."
Yes the governor just issued a notices requesting all visitor to cancel any planned trips to the Hawaiian island at least for the next thirty days.
"So the islands blame tourists for the virus but the virus is there now. It’s everywhere. It came from China and was spread around by a tour company operator on Oahu. What about people from Hawaii that are trying to get home? Should they not bring their filthy germs back to the islands? I get that the suggestion is don’t fly but it’s not a choice for some that need to work, get home, or have non-refundable EXPENSIVE trips planned. Not everyone is coming there to swim with dolphins and sit in bars. My trip is booked for April 39-May 6 and I’ve heard not a peep from Hawaiian about my flight or Airbnb about my stay. If they don’t want me, I’ll take my refund. I live in San Diego, also a big tourist city and good luck telling people not to come here. Lol"
Should we travel to Hawaii who in April do you to the coronavirus
"420TimeTravel, your statement about how the virus is in Hawaii is not correct. National state and county parks and facilities are closed. Restaurants are starting to do take out or delivery only. We have very limited medical facilities. The governor has asked that tourists stay away for 30 days. If you get sick and need to be quarantined it will be in a county facility. Tours and activities for tourists are closing down. Stay home."
#158 - No you should not travel to Hawaii in April.
"Um, COVID19 is on the islands. Go watch Big Island News. So much misinformation, GAW..."
"420, reread fishdiva’s reply to you. She wasn’t denying that there are cases of CoVid-19 in Hawaii. She was disagreeing with you as to how the virus got there. The fact is that we don’t know specifically how it got there, and never will.~ Colleen"
Traveling equals spreading. Do your part and stay home!
"Yes, I believe we are up to 11-12 cases now. I try to keep myself well informed. The newest case as of yesterday is on the island of Hawaii. Do read what I actually posted."
The Governor of Hawaii doesnt want visitors for 30 dayshttps:/…
We travelled to Honolulu with our family for March break on 14 Mar 2020. We flew from Canada. We are more likely to get the virus from home. Everything at home is shut down. We also travelled with teenagers. We are considering staying another week. Why go home to the chaos. There is one confirmed case at the moment in Oahu. She worked at the Ranch. The Polynesian Center is closed. Any social gathering of more than fifty people is not allowed so some Laus are cancelled. I can’t say if you should come but to be honest I don’t want to come home as it sounds dreadful their right now.
"Kathleen...you are badly misinformed. There are more cases than the one you mentioned--in fact, 2 new ones just yesterday on top of the others on Oahu.Not only are most attractions shutting down---museums, the Aquarium, Pearl Harbor, many restaurants, stores, all parks, and more are closed or closing today.GO HOME. We don't have the ability to care for our residents, much less tourists. You also have no clue how high medical expenses will be for you here.You also should read your new rules about flying home..because soon you won't be able to."
"Kathleen, you have no idea where you're more likely to be exposed to CoVid-19. Why go home now? Because it's home ~ and because you can still get back there.~ Colleen"
Have you gone over to Hawaii we are supposed to leave on the 20 of March it looks like everything is closed I myself not worried but with everything closed might be difficult
"Dee, who are you addressing? The original poster planned to travel in April. This forum is overflowing with discussion about this topic, but you needn't read much to gain a basic understanding of where things stand. That aside, domestic travel from and to anywhere is discouraged at this time. ~ Colleen"
"Kathleen, will you be able to get a flight to get home to Canada? Westjet cancelled flight cancelled all intl flights including US for 30 days and Air Canada may be cancelling flights due to demand. The Canada-US border will be closed soon which will also impact flights. If you have any symptoms you won't be allowed on the flight.Medical insurance is no longer valid since you travelled after the trip advisory.Yes, there are increased cases in Canada but at least if you are home you will have healthcare if anything happens."
"For those even considering travel to HI now, I'm not understanding the thinking. What exactly do you plan to do on your vacation once you arrive? Sitting on the beach? How would you obtain any supplies/food to do so?"
"Maybe read this for a resident's take about tourists coming now:https://medium.com/@serenegunnison_78499/thinking-about-traveling-to-hawaii-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-don-t-57211a515862I can't use tiny url programs due to security, but just highlight and right click.STAY HOME."
Oh---the number of cases yesterday was at 14.
"Yes, cancel. I am here on vacation now (Oahu) and as of yesterday most services are closing (restaurants, bars, excursions, resort services such as spa, etc...,) It will only get worse and I’m sure flights will start cancelling as travelers cancel."
@AkamaiNick4SW Thank you for the article. That’s a fair article not written in hate for the haoles as so much of that hate is being spread around the internet it’s nice to see the aloha.
"I trust you mean the word Haole in its original meaning---""without breath"" or foreigner?Don't underestimate the tremendous frustration and yes, anger---- many of us feel at ***all*** tourists who are planning to visit right now and in the coming 2 months or so. We are tired of being seen as some magic amusement park.We will take huge economic hits for the next 6-8 months, at the least. People will lose their houses, jobs (some already have), and more. More tourists won't help that, either."
"Australians have been told by our government not to travel overseas and the Aussie Dollar has dropped to 59 US cents, No more Aussie tourists in Hawaii for at least 6 months at this stage."
"Tourists aren’t to blame for government shutdowns. I live in a magical amusement park too. I wouldn’t mind if traffic wasn’t so bad. What’s worse is this is a border town. So, although I sympathize, this is America and we are all in this together. If you had a prepaid trip to Disneyland I wouldn’t represent all of California in my distaste of your potential travel plans, I guess that’s what I’m finding hard to understand. Hawaii doesn’t stand alone in this fight against the unseen enemy."
"Hawaii is so isolated--which is a reason we are more vulnerable........to all kinds of disasters. We also face more shortages and impacts for goods and vital services than the mainland. We can't just drive to another State to get ""more"".........."
"As of today’s date 3/118/20, tourists are advised to stay away & reschedule. Bars, restaurants and parks(that means many beaches) have been closed for 30 days. It could get worse"
"Here is a new article which addresses closures:https:/…The closures are only for 15 days--right now.Edited: 9:54 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"I read that article from Serene Gunnison from the medium and an incompetent individual in the comment section suggested shutting down Hawaii for 18 months. She also believes the outcome would be a ""temporary plunge"" . She is clearly in no position to be giving advice when she doesn't understand economics. I wish the Hawaiian Governor's month lockdown would be extended to at least four months. No bailouts! The governor needs to see the consequences of his actions and the residents need to feel the consequences. He has been living off the taxpayers for over 25 years."
I wouldn’t go...we just left and things are closing down...Sorry
Please come and spread the virus to the islands further :) Our hospitals can handle it. It's not like we're on an island with limited health care facilities.
"I have been following this thread for over a week as the situation has worsened for our nation, as well for states and local communities. Yes, I had a vested interest. Reservations made almost a year ago for a month on windward Oahu, with trips planned to three other islands. The internet makes it so much easier to take the pulse of a place than ever before - HNN, KHON, PBS Hawaii. Today I believe I did my part by rebooking everything from April to June. Is that enough? I really don't know, but I knew it was the right thing to do now. Prayers to the people of Hawaii, may the Aloha spirit continue to thrive in these uncertain times."
"Mahalo for your changes, Tenn."
"You’re more optimistic than I am, tenn, rescheduling to June. Here’s hoping you’re right...!~ Colleen"
"Hawaii airports are mandating 14 day quarantine for everyone coming into Hawaii. Individuals will have to home quarantine for 14 days with the exception of essential workers or health care professionals. Details still be worked out, so yes, I would cancel the trip."
The proposed quarantine is not a done deal.
This thread has taken on a life of its own. Any word from the OP as to a decision?
"Too true! And nope, the OP hasn't come back. Not unusual...people often don't."
Well our governor here in California issued a statewide stay at home order this evening. Read order. Coming to a neighborhood near you wherever you may be.
"We are cancelling our and we have a condo in Maui, real bummer"
"Hello,I'm not sure if you have seen the news. Today , 03/19/2020, LT Governor wants to implement a 14 day quarantine on all arrivals for all islands. Kauai has a curfew. The House Speaker is urging the Governor to have the residents shelter in place for 15 days. Public parks are closed and lifeguards are not on duty. All Oahu restaurants and bars are closed except for take out. I would reschedule so you can enjoy Hawaii and really experience the aloha spirit."
"Yes, the latest news is updated almost hourly. Thanks for the reminder though!!"
"Did you end up traveling? And if so, how was your experience at the airport.. were there long lines? And are the beaches in Oahu open to the public?"
"Sandra, take just a few minutes to scan topics on this forum. You'll quickly learn that not only are beaches & city parks closed, but that the island(s) in general are closed for business. This is not a good time to travel anywhere.~ Colleen"
Didn't Sandra post before....maybe a change of screen name today????DON'T COME. STAY HOME.
"I live in Waikiki...Most everything is closed until April 30...beaches, parks, shopping, restaurants. I would not recommend"
"Things are really closed until APRIL 30? I assumed that would eventually happen, but around me (Michigan) things are officially closed (restaurants, public venues) just until the end of March, at which time I imagine they will continue extending. Oahu has already said it won't be business as usual until at least May?"
Actually all dine in restaurants will close today the 20th for 15 days. City and county parks will stay closed until April 30. That's how it is at this moment but subject to change of course.
"They just found 10 more cases today on Oahu...and that was by noon our time.........again, PLEASE don't come."
Curious if you guys are still going? I heard beaches and tours are cancelled.
Hawaii tourism agency says do not come.Place is shutting down.Cancel.
"@ xiomarasaba Read this post from someone who decided to travel anyway and now highly regrets it. They are on Maui with nothing to do, and not welcome at all. https:/…106132736 I’m glad they had the guts to admit their mistake and let others know. Stay home and stay safe. Everyone. Please.Edited: 11:33 am, March 21, 2020 "
"Not only are all activities, tours, trails, parks and restaurants closed (takeout for some restaurants).......you could have a real problem returning home. NJ is locking down, and you could face a quarantine here in Hawaii--and another at home. Stay home."
"Still going April 29 to Big Island. We have a stay home order here too. Everyone still out walking their dogs and enjoying the sunshine. I’m not going to Hawaii to ride horses and ride dolphins with starfish in my hair or to sit in bars. If you’re coming to San Diego anytime soon, it’s still gorgeous, sun is still shining, birds are still tweeting...so enjoy."
"Good---glad to hear SD is so lovely............STAY THERE.You just don't seem to get it. You also don't seem to grasp that your own state is locking down even more than Hawaii.By April 29th, you may not have a choice--or face quarantine on both ends--Hawaii and when you return home."
"Thank you, 420TimeTravel, for serving as evidence that nothing short of a ban on domestic travel will be effective.~ Colleen"
"Hahaha. What happened to “only you can decide what’s best for you” you seem to really get joy out of telling people what they should do. Bottom line is this: my flights are not canceled, in fact they are full.. not a single person on my flights has canceled. My Airbnb host is lovely, welcoming, and has been in constant communication. My husband is still working and I’ve already been sick and over this virus. Unlikely that we will be re-infected. There is no 14 day quarantine so quit spamming fake news."
Nobody said there is a quarantine NOW.How do you know you had COVID-19? What happened? COVID-19 and people who wouldn't stop the spread. WE DON'T WANT YOUR GERMS. STAY HOME.You airbnb host is desperate for money.
"What happened to ""only you can decide what's best for you""? The situation has changed dramatically and continues to do so daily. I think you probably won't have any choice than to cancel as things continue to ratchet up anyway. Even if you're allowed to go, all nonessential travel should be canceled."
"You must be wealthy. Yes? I’m not giving away over $1,000 in non-refundable fees because of some internet scare tactics. I got the virus from the ER when my epileptic husband had a seizure from all this stress. If we want to take our vacation as planned, it’s not up to you. It’s up to the state of Hawaii. They aren’t banning flights. I’m going. I’ll toast y’all from the hot tub overlooking the ocean. ALOHA"
My circumstances have nothing to do with the situation.I think I see why your husband had a seizure.
You have no aloha in your heart. Maybe you should be banned.
"LOL......ahhh, yes--the old tired ""aloha"" means WHAT I WANT. Whatevah.......and sorry, but I am just as ""entitled"" to my opinion as you are."
Not when your opinion is mean spirited. Sorry but it’s obvious you aren’t a nice person. ALOHA.
"Cancel your trip.Everything is closed. Restrictions are ramping up daily. There are increasing calls for the state to shut down tourist arrivals completely. You could pack in the evening and wake up the next morning with your flight cancelled. You will have trouble finding places to eat, things to do. There are no lifeguards on the beaches due to lack of protective equipment. We have community transmission in Hawaii. You could get sick and have to get care at our completely overwhelmed medical facilities.You could catch the virus, be asymptomatic and pass it to someone else or bring it back to your friends and coworkers.Come back when this passes. You'll have a much better vacation."
"@420 please get off your high horse and entitlements. Please stay home please keep our islands safe don’t be that person You stand for everything we despise about tourists. One who cares only of themselves and not the community which is totally opposite of our ways. I’m sure you can find a way to get a refund. Please don’t be that ugly gross tourist that cliche ..And if you do still try to come , I hope they implement the mandatory 14 day quarantine on you. And if you still decide to disregard the quarantine I hope they slap you with a fine far greater than the price of your vacation.Edited: 4:52 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"For those thinking of still flying, all flights into/out of NY and Philly were halted for a while today as they went “ATC-Zero”. An Air Traffic Controller trainee test positive for COVID-19 and shut down all air traffic in that area as they scrambled to clean the facility and enact secondary protocols The possibility of air traffic in the US eventually being suspended just went up a notch, IMHOEdited: 4:56 pm, March 21, 2020 "
Definitely should be canceling now if you haven't already. I believe the airports are now requiring a 14-day quarantine which means if you have to stay in your hotel for 14 days. Also all of our restaurants and bars are only doing take out and are not doing dining service. Parks and City beaches are now shut down as well. So I don't think there's much you would be doing here that you wouldn't be doing back at home. Also the majority of our first cases this month have all been travel relatedfrom people either traveling here or traveling out of here and bringing it back and now we are starting to have community spread unfortunately.
"No. There is no quarantine yet and no one knows when or how it will be done yet--if it is.I believe there *should* be a quarantine--but not some ""honor system"" in a hotel or condo. First, people won't obey it. Second, and more importantly-- all it will do is cause more and more spread, since they will be in contact with a lot of people every day and night during that 14 days.I still think the old Animal Quarantine Facility is a great place for incoming tourists for a quarantine."
Quarantine mandatory March 26 for 14 days 48 cases now
"Ah, the entitled society.I paid for my vacation, and no one can deny that of me.Yes, I might spread pestilence and death, but I will not be denied.I paid my fees.Maybe a good reason to invoke martial law?Just thinking,Hunt"
Hunt OMG you're on the hawaii forums too. right now. loved your posts on Vegas.
@420 it's really sad to see you've put the value of your life and others at $1000.
14 day quarantine when you arrive in Hawaii. Best to cancel.
"Yes, you probably should cancel. If you arrive on or after March 26, you will be required to stay in your residence/hotel room for 14 days, as a quarantine. This also applies to returning residents."
"Some people are very protective of the Aina. Look at the recent protest against TMT, the wind turbines and some telling tourist to go back home. I can see tourist walking around after March 26 being confronted."
People are cancelling trips for June! April is easy. Cancel and get as much cash back as you can.
"NO. You should NOT still fly. It is disrespectful and elitist to our islands, elderly, and community to come visit, put our lives at risk, for a simple vacation. PLEASE delay your trip. We are currently under shelter in place orders. You can’t even sit at the beach or park at beach parks until April 30 AT LEAST. Please let this blow over and i promise Oahu will welcome you with loving arms and a wonderful time AFTER this is all over."
Are you guys still responding to 420's post a week ago?
"I would recommend YES, do cancel. I just returned yesterday from Oahu. Everything is closed and the governor has issued a stay at home order until further notice. He has also told all visitors to leave the islands. Locals were protesting earlier with signs telling tourists to leave. Even the pull-off scenic parking lots are closed and roped off. They said tickets would be issued for anyone found on a closed beach or park. Our vacation was not a good one. Oh, and the staff at the hotels and airport do not know proper methods to clean and limit the spread of infection. I am a retired surgery nurse so I know exactly what to watch for. Restaurants are all closed except for carry out, but remember, someone is cooking and handling your food. Don't put your family at risk. Cancel and do your trip once this has all cleared."
"Beginning Thursday, March 26, 2020, 12:01 a.m., all individuals, both residents and visitors, arriving or returning to the State of Hawaii will be subject to a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine. The mandate -- the first such action in the nation -- applies to all arrivals at state airports from the continental U.S. and international destinations and extends to other private and commercial aircrafts. Click here for the order and here for the second supplemental proclamation."
"I would if you can. I want to share this to everyone to actually honour "" social distancing "" My friend passed away 2 days ago, and she is a gym instructor, health freak and clean freak. I remember her she always carry hand sanitizer even before this covid started and she is Fit & only 30 years old, never had any flu for the past 12 years and she was also asymptomatic at first and when she got tested and turns positive it was too late. She died alone, no visitors allowed at all. Dont risk it, it doesnt matter how healthy you are. This is a pandemic mass."
"Yes cancel. If you don't you will have to stay in your hotel and quarantine the duration of your stay. Everything is closed. Bars, restaurants, beaches, parks, malls and a lot more. Please come visit our beautiful Islands once thing sare safe to come."
"I don't know why you guys (unless it's one person) bother opening new accounts to answer the same question. It's pretty obvious that no one right in the mind would travel anywhere, let alone to secluded islands, in the current situation."
"Lol, Kat...."
"There are some that came here to quarantine. There are saying its safer to be in Hawaii than in their own state.Edited: 1:28 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Yeah, I posted about that. Nothing we can do as long as they obey the quarantine."
All those posting it is up to you....well that is correct. However I have had many of my friends come here the last two years. I can tell you that with quarantine being mandatory and with most of the business closed and food regulated to take out....I would cancel your trip to anywhere in Hawaii right now. Usually all are very welcoming to tourists...however right now no one wants tourist to come here. Sorry this is a great vacation spot...just not right now. I would plan you trip for the fall
"Hi Oahu Visitor, Just an FYI the Hawaii state governor concurrently with the Honolulu city mayor have issued a mandatory 14 day quarantine for all visitors to Hawaii. If you and your family are coming, I recommend postponing the trip until a later date (when I do not know). Violators of the self-quarantine will be fined up to $2000 per person (I have friends in HPD and can verify). Also all additional costs (extra hotel expenses, rental car expenses, etc.) are incumbent on the visitor/tourist. - Oahu Resident"
"Just say yes cancel and close the thread.Edited: 1:14 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"yes please cancel your trip. Its not so much about you getting sick but about making a sacrifice to protect others. your vacation is NOT essential travel.why would you even consider putting yourself,your kids and the people of hawaii at risk? to do so is selfish and totally irresponsible. everything is closed and hawaii residents are not welcoming to tourists right now. please stay at home.like you are supposed to."
"This post is a month old. Whatever just let it go, folks."
