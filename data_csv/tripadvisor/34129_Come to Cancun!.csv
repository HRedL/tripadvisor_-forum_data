"We are here now and having a lovely experience. Restaurants and hotels are open. Beaches and pools are open to tourists. Precautions are being taken everywhere....masks required unless you are at the beach/pool, eating or drinking. Temps being taken before you enter any store or restaurant. The locals/staff are polite, happy we are here and enthusiastic to welcome us as patrons to their community. There is no nightlife or clubs open, so if you are looking for the Cancun experience pre-Covid, you would be best to post pone your trip. If you are looking for a relaxing vacation with Covid precautions in place and workers who are happy you are visiting their community, come on down to Cancun and have a blast!"
Thanks for the update. I'm planning on coming next week. I understand clubs are closed but did you see any bars outside of the AIs open even if it was only until 11?
There are plenty of places to grab a drink and the hotel lobby bars are open as well. Mextreme has their outside bar open and you can watch the servers dance and carry drinks on their head! The food there is delicious as well.
"Re: post #2 I have noticed the same. However, I'm sure that Cancun and the Riviera Maya is still very safe because all the people coming from the COVID-hotbed states in the US are self-quarantining for 14 days before their trip and are being tested for COVID just before they leave the US. Not very likely given that they don't even need to quarantine when they return home.This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better."
"Just remember in terms of grabbing a drink somewhere that the restaurant bar type places are only open because they also serve food. So you can't just sit down and drink. Food must be part of the equation. FThere are no true ""bars"" open now."

"Last I read some hotels but not all were allowing guests to use “their” beach. Are all Cancun beaches indeed “open to tourists”?Lots of activity on the forums now, and I hope we don’t see a huge spike in infectionshere in a few weeks as a result...Edited: 11:40 am, July 24, 2020 "
"Not all resorts are allowing guests to use the beach. So no, all Cancun beaches are not open for tourists. And all public access points to all beaches are closed to everyone."
They Grand Hyatt in Playa Del Carmen is the only one I have heard of that is not allowing access. What are the others that are not allowing guest to access the beach?
"I see the same things, a lot coming from the hotbeds in the states, only a matter of time before someone brings more to Cancun, unfortunately!!!!!"
"That's a broad statement to make, we have been quarantined for the last 14 days, took covid tests on Monday and got our negative results on Wednesday. We continue to plan to social distance and wear masks when we are there next week. Just because you choose not to travel to spew your hate at others who are responsible."
"""Just because you choose not to travel to spew your hate at others who are responsible.""I'm not sure who you're referring to. I read all the posts on this thread and there's nothing in any of that can be construed as hate. Disagreement as to whether people should travel here now and whether tourists are bringing Covid here, but no hate. Please be careful in your wordings. Just because someone doesn't share your opinion does mean that they're ""spewing hate"". Let's try and keep these threads as cordial as possible please."
"My apologies if I miss read post, if it was just an opinion and you are correct it is a positive community."
"Sounds good, happy to hear stuff is opening up.Edited: 4:51 pm, July 24, 2020 "
Juan... I also thought post #4 was snarky. I’m going to Mexico next Sunday & pretty much doing the same as you. We’ve been working from home & laying low the past week. We will continue to do so until our trip.
"In reference to post #5, not true. We drank at our hotel lobby bar the last two nights and did not order food. Same was true last night in two other restaurants where we drank and did not order food. We are still here and the same held true while at our hotel pool today...ordered drinks and no food and were promptly served! Cheers!"
I'm pretty sure Joan wasn't talking about All Inclusive resort bars. Regular bars on the street have to serve food.
"Seems to be a handful of posters whose sole purpose all day is to inject every Yucatan thread with their opinions on how bad everything is even though they are thousands of miles away. There are exceptions as I think Joan is a very active Tripadvisor member with firsthand, on the ground, balanced viewpoints.However, there are several on here who feel their ""job"" is to ridicule any decision by others that doesn't agree with their own. Do not feel you have to justify your decisions to the nannies. Be responsible as your medical professionals and the US and Mexico authorities allow.Edited: 7:53 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"""I'm pretty sure Joan wasn't talking about All Inclusive resort bars. Regular bars on the street have to serve food.""That's exactly what I meant. Bars outside the resorts."
"Thank you, Greg N, and very well said."

"Yes. That is exactly what I am talking about as well but a lot of people just don´t get it. That pisses me off sometimes and makes me wonder if the feelings (negative) I have towards the majority of toursits I see here in Cancun, Playa Del Carmen and Tulum are correct. More and more I think yes. By the way those feelings are based on observations and personal experience. What a shame."
Why doesn’t Canada simply shut down all flights to/from CUN?
"They did so with the land border. I guess there are a lot less people flying compared to using the land borders so maybe that could be the reason. Also they can easily monitor who goes out and who and when comes in. The main point here is, that stay at home is an advice, not an order so please don´t mix up those two. However wearing a face mask and social distancing is not an advice but a mandatory requirement here and strictly enforced."
"Paul - Not completely sure I follow. I'm just trying to understand why you have negative feelings toward travelers right now. I can understand the feeling of frustration with travelers who refuse to follow protocols like those from WHO. Doesn't it make sense to target those travelers vs those who travel responsibly?. What about travelers who say they will be responsible and just hang out at an AI resort?. What about the resorts who have instituted health protocols in an effort to encourage travel?. What about resort employees who continue to show up and wait on tourists?. What about the taxi drivers and shuttle drivers who drive tourists around?. What about the government agencies that refuse to take a hard stand and shut down all air traffic?If I am understanding your position -- and that's why I'm testing this with you -- there should be a lot of anger to go around. You chose to call out travelers in general, but what about all the others who play a similar role? Are they all blameless?"
Any one can tell me why cases still growing and situation worsening? If is not the movement (travelers) then who spreads? Innocent people are dying :( How to stop this?
"Well facts can be construed as what they really are, or are as one consives as to how they want to deal with the reality. Mexico is one of the highest countries with the highest mortality rates daily. But I see the same way as the US does. If you don't reopen, you will never will."
Dream Days The fact that most of the cases are in Benito Juarez tells you most of it is being spread locally through community spread not by tourist. This was increasing when the country was on lock down and had few if any tourist coming in due to hotels and resorts all being closed. That isn't to say some tourist could not be infected initially but it is more of a local spread issue now.
"Hello,I am visiting Cancun from stressful NY starting Sunday 8/2/2020.The forecast shows all rain and thunderstorms- should i be worried? I want to relax on the beach and by the pool, take in the sun and get the full Cancun experience with my girlfriend.I have read that forecast shows rain/ thunderstorms but it does not actually rain, and if it does- its for a short period of the day. I am nervous as i have been waiting for this vacation for a year and do not want it to rain all week long. Any advice/ news is heavily appreciated!Thank you!"
Tourists and residents returning from EU certainly contributed to the initial spread in the BJ (Cancun) area.. Who is to say there are not asymptomatic carriers flying in everyday?
Certainly both are possible but I don't think all of their deaths and cases have been tourist by any means. There is definitely community spread going on and also with it increasing at a time when next to no tourist were coming I don't think that is much of a stretch to surmise that isn't to suggest that some could be asymptomatic people who do not realize they have it traveling their as well it is likely a mix of both.Those people are also not likely remaining in the area as well but it is a possible that is a contributor as well but there were already a number of cases prior to travel being re--opened during shutdown. The state of Quintana Roo had just under 500 deaths at the time things started re-opening things re-opened and several thousand cases so while it may have started with asymptomatic tourist coming there or locals who traveled elsewhere and came back with it the spread now is not primarily related to tourist.
"Local newspaper: https://www.poresto.net/quintana-roo/2020/7/…Google translate: Cancun decided to open its doors to the world with the indications that it could only occupy 30 percent of the capacity of tourist service provider centers. Since that month of reopening, the accumulated positive figures have risen from one thousand 529 cases to three thousand 633 cases in Benito Juárez (Cancún); but the number that remains latent within the city is 323 active cases with the SARS-coV-2 virus."
Dream Days while limits are at 30% occupancy actually only opened at 3% and have risen since then into the low 20% range so very few tourist. The average infected person has been shown to infect 2.5 people per day which also indicates most of the spread in the Cancun area has been among locals as opposed to tourist though there has likely been some spread from locals to tourist and vice versa as well. Keep in mind the case totals from Cancun are also highly inaccurate due to lack of testing in the area. There were far more locals infected at re-opening to 3% tourist levels than indicated.
