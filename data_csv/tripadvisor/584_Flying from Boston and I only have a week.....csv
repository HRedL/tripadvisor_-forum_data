"I'm trying to optimize time, so should I just stick around Ponta Delgada and go from there? I'd like to hear from the experts what I should concentrate on in Sao Miguel. I'm looking for more about quality time than racing around and seeing every site. What is important to see and do?"
When? Are you aware of the entry regulations now in Covid19 time? https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/?page_id=5532
"Once you are permitted to visit the Azores (who knows how long that will be, given the continued spread of COVID 19 in the US), a week on Sao Miguel won’t be hurried. The island is relatively small and you can drive from end to end in 60 to 90 minutes. Actually, a week would be the ideal length of visit."
I'm looking at next year post Covid. I understand the requirements and would do whatever is required. I just flew last week and it wasn't a big deal.
"As mentioned, a week on Sao Miguel is plenty of time to see most everything without feeling rushed. It's only 287 square miles (Cape Cod is 339)It's completely up to you whether you want to spend your entire week in one place (Ponta Delgada or elsewhere) or divide your time between 2 locations. We chose to divide our time between PDL and Furnas and that was the best decision for us. What you do with your time, really depends on your interests. If you enjoying hiking, there are plenty of wonderful hikes with beautiful vistas. The island is covered with some of the best views (Miradoro's) you can imagine.I wrote a trip report that covered our 6 nights on the island. We visited all of the main attractions, except for the Ilheu de Vila Franca, which was just out of season when we went. Here's the link to my report:https:/…103620565If you dont feel like reading all of it, I would just check out the Things to Do tab for Sao MIguel so you can get an idea of the top places to see, things to do. We absolutely loved the Azores. Can't wait til we can visit there again!"
