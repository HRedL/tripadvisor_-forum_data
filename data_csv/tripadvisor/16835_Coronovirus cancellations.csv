We had to cancel our trip to verbier due to the coronovirus. We booked our accommodation through interhome and they are not being at all forthcoming wrt refunds or offering us a change of date. Has anyone else had any experience of having to cancel and get refunds and what were the outcomes?
"Alison this is the issue ive been writing about for days. I've been requesting for a cancellation even before we got into the country from booking.com but they cannot force interhome hand. Interhome claims to have no policy instruction and currently the only genuine way is if you cant get to your destination.It is ridiculous as todays live announcement was emergency procedures to lock down. But as we are in Zurich as of this morning before borders are closed and SSB are still running trains to Zermatt we are still ""able to get there"".Therefore they wont refund(interhome). Booking.com can only force it if we cannot arrive either. I understand their rights of no cancellation but given the damage to goodwill it seems ridiculous with a lockdown in place and restrictions they still on a technicality want to hold the contract.We will see what tomorrow begins but may just ger out of Switzerland asap before countries ban us from transiting to get home.I certainly will be avoiding interhome going forward. Even their forced ERV travel insurance have been completely useless. interhome tell you to cancel and take it up with insurance yet insurance excludes it on fine print as the ""inclusions"" talks about epidemics not pandemics. They do not list pandemics as an exclusion. But its lack of inclusion also allows them to worm out. I find the behaviour given the situation leaves a much sour taste. I definitely will be reconsidering how we book plans going forward if we ever try to come back - we do really want to experience swiss alps.We may just use air bnb with cancellations and bypass all the money hungry hotels and organisations."
"Pandemic is an epidemic that has spread through out the world. [epidemic pertains to a particular region]so by dictionary definition, pandemic is many steps more severe. an insurance including epidemic will NOT rule out a pandemic.very sorry for the sad mess every one is going through.we are also trying to get at least some vouchers from airlines for our Apr 2--21 trip"
"Yes but as they havent listed pandemics and only epidemic in their ""inclusions"" they seek to worm their way out.... seems wrong but one reason i will not be using interhome and haven't much respect for the ERV travel insurance either."
My credit card company has been great and has credited everything back pertaining to our triip. Call them and explain the situation and they will dispute on your behalf as long as you have a good CC company your with. They understand the BS some of these companies are trying to get away with.
"Always book with the hotel directly. When this sort of scenario happens it is easier to deal with ""real live people"" than a booking engine."
We have had the exact same issue! We were scheduled for a home booked with Interhome.com as well in Barcelona March 12-21. Pandemic was declared March 11 and our president advised no traveling to and from Europe. Interhome will not budge! On their website they are only recognizing cancellations March 24-April 30. I went back and forth with ERV insurance too. Got the same response about epidemic vs pandemic. I also won't be booking with interhome again. NO compassion.
"I don't know about ""no compassion"" but they certainly have no sense of the damage they are doing to future business."
"Not necessarily. I have had to cancel 15 hotels I had booked for our 6 week trip to Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. I’d booked them all individually through booking.com and hotels.com, with most being ‘non-refundable’ because of the much lower price, yet I’ve had 100% success with refunds! I found both booking & hotels to be super helpful with email contact and quick refunds."
I was referring solely to Interhome - in this case. Glad to hear though you have been able to cancel reservations. I had a similar experience in the USA - had to cancel a hotel within the CAX deadline and they were more than gracious about it.
"I had an apartment booked with interhome starting on the 19th April for 5 daysThey have sent me emails direct and through booking.com saying they will refund me, 16 days ago and I am still waiting.I am told to be patient and it could take up to 4 weeks!!!Edited: 12:08 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"Yes, but that's really not their fault, is it? Most of my refunds have come through now but I'm still waiting for a few. Perfectly understandable if you think of how many hundreds of thousands of people have cancelled things over the past months - and the fact that the credit card employees are working from home. Just sit tight - you'll get it:)"
If they say you will be refunded you will. Things take a lot of time these days. Swiss is refunding tickets for me but I have been warned it could take months. Be patient!!
"HiI am having exactly the same issue, we were due to travel on 13th March to Nendaz but decided not to travel due to Covid. I am getting nowhere with ERV. It clearly states on the confirmation from Interhome that cancellation is included. Have you had any luck?"
