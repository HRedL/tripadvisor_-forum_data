"I have a trip planned for GNP, Banff, and Jasper for July 26-August 3. Should I cancel?"
I highly doubt the border will be open for Americans by then. Your country is doing a very poor job of containing the outbreaks. But.... have you prepaid for anything? Is there a refund policy? Might be better to wait and let the flights be cancelled by the airlines.
I have only paid deposits on hotels in Banff and Jasper. Reserved in GNP. Nothing else was booked.
"Are your deposits refundable? If not, you might want to wait until more information is available about the Canada/US border and whether it will be possible for you to make the trip ... although like Beachy, I, too, think it is unlikely. I have travel booked to another province in Canada at around that same time, and even that is looking unlikely at this point."
"We are planning a trip for the same week. I have had everything booked since late last year, including flights, rental car, and hotels. We are flying Southwest into Spokane and driving up. I do not plan to cancel unless I absolutely must. If our flights are cancelled, then we will get a 100% refund, and I will then be forced to get refunds for our rooms and cancel our trip. I highly doubt that our flights will be cancelled, though I fully expect them to get changed again. They have already been changed once.If the Canadian national parks are closed or we are not allowed to cross borders, then we will likely still fly to Spokane, but find some things to do in Idaho and Montana instead. There are enough national forest lands and state parks out there, that I feel like we will be able to find something spectacular yet uncrowded."
hi The Canada/US border is closed until May 20 - you will only get an idea about the border re-opening near that date. Anything else is just a guess.
Here is an article from a local paper. They are thinking late May but understand that many workers come to work from overseas and no one is in place so it would be a very slow process to get to full staffing. I think July is being very optimistic. I work for tour companies and we have cxl'd till sept and perhaps beyone.https:/…
"Jasper and Banff will be there next summer, they are not going away. Until such time as there is a vaccine this unwanted virus guest will still be a threat to all of us who have not been affected thus far. Also you will not be able to get travel health insurance so why risk it?"
"We'd planned our trip for 2 years as a graduation gift for our granddaughter. Our dates were July 31 to Aug 11. I cancelled everything this week. It was painful and I got a little teary when I finished talking with the hotel reservation staff.I'll also suggest if you want to see GNP MT, Banff and Jasper in one trip, add another week for next year. One week isn't enough time."
"Our son's birthday was on the day the pandemic was declared and we were going to take him on a rally driving course in Washington, so that's all on hold too. Its very hard - on everyone, no matter the reason - but the more we are in this thing, the more I am starting to suspect that things are going to be closed for a lot longer than we thought. I was booking my May trip to Newfoundland trip in January and didn't cancel until late March, thinking it may still be possible. That seems laughable now.I have to agree that we just don't know. If they can get adequate supplies of drugs that can treat the most serious cases, then things will open up sooner. If any of these 70 different approaches on finding an effective vaccine start to look promising and production is implemented quickly (and the Gates Foundation is doing amazing work there), then we can probably expect to be able to plan more broadly. If they can even get a rapid and accurate test in place so that we can determine quickly and simply if you have Sars-CoV2 or not so that people can be screened and either released or turned around, that would provide some measure of opportunity for the uninfected.Personally, I would wait, but if I was betting on the outcome, I'd say all international travel for 2020 is out."
Have to agree with others - start planning for next year. I've had to cancel all three trips planned for this spring and yes it does hurt (feel your pain JB) but now I look forward to next year with even more enthusiasm!Hey V67 - maybe meet you in NL next June :-)
Air Canada seems optimistic for international travel later this year. Cost of flying...we'll see!https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/air-canada-…
"We're planning a trip to Nova Scotia with friends next August! We'd thought about NL too, but I think we're going to just stick with NS!Happy Planning to us all!"
"I would look at what penalties you would have to pay for your flights if you cancelled and anything else you have booked.Is your GNP the one in MT? or the one in BC? If in MT, do you plan on driving across the border to the Canadian Rockies?If you can cancel without penalty, then it is up to you. Otherwise, it would be better to wait. If the Canada-US border closure extends beyond May 21st, the current expiry date for restrictions, the second extension will likely go for 30 more days to June 21st. If you can tolerate going month to month to not lose some of your money might be worth it to you. If the airline cancels because they are not permitted to enter Canada, you will get a full refund. Currently, there are 1.1 million cases of COVID-19 in the US and 55 thousand cases in Canada. Until those numbers come down to a manageable level in the eyes of our Chief Health Officer, the border will not open."
"I actually have the complete opposite views to many of the posters here. Yes, May is now confirmmed for the border being shut down, but there was a lot of push back with that decision...and you are talking 2 months later...I personally think no question the border will be open. Also, everyone was running around with fear thinking we would be on lock down till fall, and our death tolls were on trend in the 100,000s, yet much of Alberta is opening up this weekend, with phase 2 opening up probably next month. On top of that, it will be one of those rare moments where crowds won't overwhelm everything. 2021 will be insane for crowds! Bookings are already seeing this.I personally wouldn't cancel till June and base your decision on that. It's all about your risk tolerance, but for me, I'm heading to the coast the second the airlines allow for international non-essential travel!Edited: 10:06 am, May 03, 2020 "
"I'm going to amend my statement from earlier in the thread. I tend to be of the mindset of Littlechilds. If our trip to the Rockies was just my husband and myself I'd wait until the last possible minute to cancel. Since we're traveling with our granddaughter and her best friend we feel like we needed to cancel, heartbreaking as it was."
"I think it depends entirely where in the country you are and what states border your region. Here in Ontario, where we have our own issues in controlling the spread, some of our major US border crossings are with states that have had enormous outbreaks and great challenges in controlling them. The last thing we want is to have the NY and Michigan border crossings opened in the near future."
