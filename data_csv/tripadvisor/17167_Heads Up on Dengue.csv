"Thanks for the info, it's very important to always have a good repellant."
"DEET mosquito repellent is one of the few items I am careful to carry with me when I travel, rather than relying on local availability. DEET has its problems and it is a powerful solvent that can destroy clothing and plastics. The safe solution -- and one that does not pose any problems with airline security -- is towelettes moistened with a DEET solution. Off and Repel brands are widely available in the United States, but I don't know about elsewhere, because I only buy it at home."
"yelvington, I thoroughly agree, you definitely need a deet spray, the others don't work I've tried them and have been eaten alive and you only use it for a couple of weeks so why risk it."
Different repellents work for different people. You just need to work out what's best for you.
"True, however some people over do it with the very high concentrations of Deet.About 35% is just as effective as 70%, and significantly less caustic to skin and plastics (camera body etc.)"
"I actually have good success using one of the ""herbal"" repellents. But, It only needs to work for a very short period, while I head out in the morning to feed the hound! I wouldn't rely on it for any period of time. Many types will work. It's often a matter of how long they are effective."
"I am a very organic type person..in all walks of my life, EXCEPT mosquitos..they eat me alive and rely on DEET when i travel. i hate to use it, but have no choice. Tried everything, only DEET works..i use Ben's, which i get in the US."
"Another year, and at epidemic levels already, and the year isn't even half over...555""The Department of Disease Control on Friday announced a dengue haemorrhagic fever epidemic this year as there have been 28,785 patients, 43 of whom died.Dr Preecha Prempree, deputy director-general of the department, said that the figures were from Jan 1 to June 11, when the number of patients doubled the five-year average.""http://bit.ly/2ZrUOIh"
"I think they want my blood cause its full of alchol. Then i think they like A+ bloo, tasty"
"I agree with webme, post 4, that different repellants work for different people. What works for one doesn’t necessarily work for everyone."
"Agree with the good cautionary advice here and also the observation that whilst one of the more effective repellants, DEET attacks plastics - it is no respecter of expensive camera equipment. Because it works ok for me (but may not for others) I prefer and use citronella based repellants."
