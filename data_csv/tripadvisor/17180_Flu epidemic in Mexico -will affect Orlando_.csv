"Representatives of both the Mexican and USA health boards have been on TV this morning talking about a varient of flu (swine flu) which has killed about 70 people in Mexica and has also been found in people from Texas and Calafonia. It is feared that this will become pandemic.I'm just wondering if there are any GP's or medical people on the forum who would know if people who have had the flu injection (in the UK) will be covered against this? I know that our last flu injections covered some kind of swine flu strain, but I wonder if it will be enough to protect against this new one.These things have a habit of spreading quickly and I don't fancy wandering around Disney with a mask on! I have health problems which make me suseptable to things like this but I have been vaccinated against the flu and pneumonia.Regards,Deaconblue"
"Florida is really far away from Mexico/California. I suppose all it takes is someone to travel from California to Florida for it to spread, but they could jump on a plane over here just as easy....I wouldn't worry too much just yet."
HI. Flu vaccines are usually specific to a particular strain of flu. It takes about 2 weeks i believe for the health athoroties to isolate a particular strain and then develop the vaccine. In an emergency flu pandemic situation large gatherings such as theme parks and football games etc are prohibited to minimise the spread anyway. Facemasks are not particulary effective in my experience. I am a nurse but dont work in a hospital anymore but have had flu pandemic training including emergency measures. I really wouldnt worry about it as the press has a way of scaremongering these situations. enjoy your holiday without worrying
just to add my training was specific to my area of work so other health professionals may have better or different knowledge. I work for the blood service in the UK
"This seems unusual .... flu season is usually petering out by this time of year, isn't it?"

"I hate Scaremongering, how can 70 deaths in a country the size of Mexico be considered an epidemic for Gods sake.Bird flu all over again"
I would not worry about it.
"I hope I wasn't scaremongering. I was simply asking a question, pertinant to me, in the hope someone may have had an answer.Bird flu was something entirely different.Deaconblue"
"This is strange you mention this. My brother in law works in the high school here in Texas that the 3 students have been infected with The swine flu. The families have been told to stay home until they make sure they are not carrying it. IF it was truly a terrible thing , they would have closed the high Schhol, but they have not. They are having a meeting tomorrow evening for parents, but if it was terrible, I believe the school would have been shut down in a heartbeat. So I agree with the above poster who said that this ""pandemic"" talk in the media is on par with the bird flu scare tactics. They gave the teens Tamiflu, and they are fine. Good question, Deaconblue, and they always say hand sanitizing is the #1 way to protect yourself."
Don't worry. It is always wise to keep a bottle of Purell with you at all times. Washing your hands is extremely important. Go and enjoy yourself.
"News tonight said it was swine flu, bird flu and another type combined. They said it was odd because this is not the normal time for flu to be flourishing. California, Texas, New York were three of the states where confirmed cases have been reported. Let's hope it dies out sooner than later."
A member of BA aircrew has been taken ill with 'flu like symtoms' so it has possibly reached London already. There is actually no way to prevent it spreading if it is airborne. J.
"I am a nurse practitioner. The flu vaccines given in 2008 will not be protective against thsi flu as it is a new strain. Most people afflicted with the new flu will have a case of the flu and recover (5-6 days of feeling like crap then back to normal). All of the deaths so far have been in Mexico, where access to the health care system is not the best. Most flu deaths are not due to the flu itself but to respiratory complications such as pneumonia following a case of flu. The majority of people who have been confirmed with this flu have had mild flu like symptoms and recovered. Unless this progresses rapidly then you should just take normal precautions when traveling, good handwashing etc. I do think that the media is blowing this a bit out of proportion- Monday my clinic will be packed with people who are convinced they have this new flu."
"I bet it doesn't help that the media is reminding folks that Tamiflu only works in the first few days of sickness, which will rush those folks to the doctor :)I take this all with a grain of salt. We could be infected at any time with anything (staph, virus, bioterror, resistant strains of flus/polio/whatnot), and I'm less worried about the stuff that we actually find out about and put on the news than the stuff no one notices in time to make a fuss over ;)Live your life, have fun, but just be mindful of your hygiene and how it affects others--that's the best we can do!"
Our doctor has prescribed Tamiflu which we take with us on trips. It is not known to be effective against all strains of flu but can be helpful if taken at the advent of the first symptoms. Ask your doctor for some if you are worried.
I hope this is not going to be bad. I dont want my honeymoon ruiened. But if it does turn out to be a nasty strain of flu they might have to restrict air travel.But if we do all have to wonder around Florida with masks on then at least we can have a massive michael jackson look-alike meeting :-)
"For the record- Tamiflu must be taken in the first 48 hours to have the best chance of lessening flu symptoms, most studies show that is decreases symptom length by 1 day, and in some cases decreases severity of symptoms, no concrete evidence that it reduces complications of the flu but it is thought that it does this as well. The main concern regarding travelers to Orlando is if this does progress in other countries (or the US) that there will be more difficulty entering and exiting countries that have epidemic numbers. With only 8 cases confirmed in the US and the early awareness more than likely that will not be a problem for anyone."
"Seems to be getting worse this.. BBC reporting it may have reached Scotland!We're flying out next Sunday - its worrying, regardless of out holidays!Leeds"
"I think what has the international medical community scared is that some of those who have died are not in the usual, elderly or very young category, but are healthy young adults. The ones who normally suffer through it feeling poorly but with no lasting effects. "
"Now that health care workers are being told to really look for the disease the numbers are definitely going to go up, the key is going to be how many new cases are developing, and are we seeing severe complications and mortality in young otherwise healthy adults, so far that has only happened in Mexico, but again, the medical community is just now being notified to be on the look out, so that could change too. It is worrsiome for people (especially international visitors) planning travel in the next 2-3 weeks because we may see some difficulty getting into and out of affected areas. Good luck to anyone planning travel soon, hopefully this will fade out quickly."
"We're flying to the US on Thursday so rang our doctor asking for a prescription of Tamiflu to take with us. He said he couldn't do this as you have to have the flu to get a prescription. We explained we were travelling to the US, Florida & Texas but he wouldn't budge."
"You can't get an NHS prescription, but private dotors will write you one. You can buy it online probably too, but it is too late for you perhaps.go, and bring hand santiser with you and apply a couple of times per day, esp on travel days."
"Do you need a prescription to buy Tamiflu in the US? Or could you just go to a drugstore and buy them?How long does it take for an specific ""Swine Flu cure"" be made?"
"There is no cure for this strain yet and according to the latest news it will take at least 6 months to develope one .If your healthy and fit you should be okay ,it is the young and the elderly that are at risk ,the young because it causes there immune system to over work causing other dangers to the body."
"Deacon blue, i wouldnt worry too much as yet. my hubby said it said on the news today not to travel to america.I wouldnt say 70 people was alot really, we all know these illnesses happen, but be carefull and wash your hands often, get a one of those cleaning gels like they have in hospitals if thats make you feel better, if it was me i would be more worried if i was going to mexico.This is not airbourne and too catch any flu you need to be in close contact with someone or there air space to catch it, touching rails on buses etc and then puttin your hands in your mouth. Im going to france this year and they say they have cases, but at the mo its is NOT a pandemic, keep a good cleansing routine and im sure you will be fine.The reason ofcourse it is spreading is because of flights to places around the world, not because it has flew across oceans."
"There will never be a Cure, it is a virus. there will be a vaccine in a month, which may be generally available in 6 mos."
