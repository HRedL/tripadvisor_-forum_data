"Just saw a news report about Seattle.. empty streets and people not going out.. I will be in Toronto in about 10 days.. are things there business as usual? Are the tourist sights still open (like the Cn tower, casa loma etc).I am from the netherlands.. we have 180 confirmed cases but daily life here seems to go on like always.. just wondering if i will notice anything while I am there."
"I find this response from people very odd. We have an influenza pandemic annually. This year's influenza is apparently responsible for 16,000 deaths in the US alone. I read one forecast this week that suggests that even a full blown pandemic from Covid will result in approximately 4,000 deaths in the US. Yet no one gets all that concerned about flu and they are treating Covid like the freakin zombie apocalypse! I can't speak to Toronto, but Vancouver is calm and open for business. Canada is being commended by the World Heath Organization for ""exemplary"" preparations and we have a pretty strong public health network that is responding appropriately. I don't know what else anyone can do....except keep calm and carry on...and wash your hands!"
"Some ppl are wearing masks on the streets and in public transit (buses, subway). More in Toronto than in cities outside it, GTA (Greater Toronto Area). But it is also more noticeable in Toronto, because there are much more ppl everywhere there. Some companies restrict employees' travel plans. Depends on where ppl work. I work where we get multiple e-mails from the health authorities telling us the updates for Ontario, for Greater Toronto Area and reminding all to wash hands, stay home when sick, self identify/stay on quarantine, and call a certain # if someone has returned from certain countries, etc. - some might call those basic things... Lots of ppl change or are considering changing their travel plans (to warmer climates) for the approaching school break mid March - seems to be when you will be here, from Mar. 14, for a week. Depends on who you talk to, which country they were going to, what type of insurance they bought, if any, and how much non refundable money they can afford to lose. Others pack and want to go on their long anticipated vacations, as usual. It is all individual. I have heard ppl telling me they were stocking up on toilet paper, water, and want to make sure they have at least a week worth supply of food in the house. Apparently, there is a shortage of hand sanitizer and masks in stores. I don't know, I have not gone looking for either, to tell you the truth. Others say, it makes no sense, ppl die from flu, too, every yr., so why panick, etc. Visited a regular health clinic just yesterday - every employee, from receptionists to technicians, was wearing masks, some covering their entire face with a clear plastic shield, like welders' ones...I had never seen those before... I don't know if it's like this in all medical centres and hospitals now or depends on the company. The employees in grocery or department stores I have visited did not seem to have masks. The streets are certainly not empty. Lots of cars in malls' parking lots, etc. I would be more concerned about the attractions being busy with families with kids due to the upcoming school break, to tell you the truth, than with anything else."
Toronto is open for business.
and do NOT follow the Advice given on TA using the orange button at the top when it comes to washing your hands follow the CDC recommendations of washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. (which can feel like a long time)https:/…prevention-treatment.html
"""...and do NOT follow the Advice given on TA using the orange button...""Very true. This thing is now accelerating, and TA being FaceBook Lite, it cannot be relied on for current or accurate information.I’ve yet to see anywhere on TA that the Province of BC is now advising all British Columbians to avoid travelling on cruise ships."
Toronto is completely business as usual. I went through Pearson Airport just yesterday and it was completely business as usual as well.
"I also came through Pearson last evening and as noted it was all as norm. Although I did notice quite a few hand sanitizer stations throughout the airport and as leaving the baggage area. Which made me realize I had not noticed the same in either YYJ or YVR which I also passed through yesterday.It should also be noted that Washington state has had a cluster of cases which they've been unable to trace back to any particular source. Whereas here in Ontario (and I believe in other parts of the country), authorities have been able to trace the cases back to countries which have been highly affected by the virus.In any case,use your common sense, and wash your hands!!"
@ #2 I am sure that there is great advice here but the lack of paragraphs makes it too hard to read through.
"@9, pls accept my apologies. I did not intend to create inconveniences for you. Feel free to skip."
"Actually paragraphs would make very little difference to Post 2 - it is a stream of sentences thrown together with very little cohesiveness.Edited: 8:26 pm, March 07, 2020 "
SubjectivelyObjectiv ~Interesting to read that some staff in the clinic you visited the other day wore plastic face shields. That kind of thing has not been mentioned here in Vancouver. I had to read your post slowly because there is a lot of typing in one paragraph but I think it is helpful info and I hope the OP reads what you have shared.
Thank you all for your replies.. from what I read it's business as usual.. thats what I was hoping for!
My son and I were at a Korean BBQ restaurant in Scarborough last night for dinner. The place was packed and there was a 20-minute wait.
"If I see people falling down as they walk down the street, then I'm going to start to panic, lol.Yeah the common flu kills way more people but the media hasn't been posting the daily flu deaths everyday. I would not go on a cruise ship right now, thats about all I can think of--unless getting stuck on a ship with thousands of others is your idea of a fun time."
Everything is pretty much running as usual right now. My family is still riding on subway and going to work and school downtown. The difference is we are not getting drive thru and we have cancelled our travel plans.
"BC public health is now recommending people cancel their cruises. Things are shifting daily and additional care around sanitation is wise but I still dont see cause for panic.Edited: 2:34 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"A week ago I was in a local lab for some tests. The staff at the reception desk were wearing clear plastic face shields. None of the staff in the actual back lab area were wearing them. One staff person I spoke to said they were more comfortable than face masks and because of being on the ""receiving line"" at reception it gave them protection from people coughing or sneezing.Of course this was in Vancouver, not Toronto but elsewhere people here are carrying on as per usual shopping etc.Edited: 4:11 pm, March 08, 2020 "

I’ve only noticed more face masks and signage about washing hands
"We were at a hospital for blood work this morning and they had a few more hand sanitizer stations. I only saw 2 people wearing masks, so maybe they were protecting others and not protecting themselves. When we got home we washed our hands very very thoroughly. Nobody looked sick. We did not use public transit but did a Sheldon and took off my ""Bus Pants"" as soon as I got home."
"My daughter works at Yorkdale and they are seeing less people there. Mind you less people at Yorkdale makes it like an ordinary mall. You can even find a parking spot. A normal day there is like last Christmas shopping any where else. This past weekend,I was in Chinatown and Kensington. Lots of people out and about but not packed crazy like normal.Lots of signs to wash hands, hand sanitizer stations.Go and TTC are doing deep cleans every night. If you take transit, wash your hands immediately. Maybe wear gloves or use your sleeves to open doors, press elevator button, stair rails."
"Parking at Yorkdale? Oh my goodness, the end is definitely here!! LOL!"
"Wow, there is a run on toilet paper! local stores near me are sold out. Limit of one per shopper, but there was not even one package to be had. So that was unusual."
"Are you planning to attend any events while here(sports, theatre)?Given how rapidly the virus is spreading, large group activities may become limited.I do see that Mirvish theatres post that they intend to honour their performance schedule. I hope they can!"
Well they have just cancelled the St Patrick's Day parade.NBA games are cancelled.
"I would not be surprised if the NHL makes an announcement shortly. It does not affect me as I can not afford the ridiculous price charged for the Toronto Maple Leaf home games.There was no hand sanitizer at my local pharmacy and even toilet paper ( the new Gold standard) was in short supply.Edited: 12:25 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"NHL has suspended all games.Edited: 1:57 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"So it is on the news right now that family members of public figures are returning from London, UK with flu symptoms. Hopefully, it is just the flu as they are being tested for Covid 19 and media is waiting on results."
"Okay Big News, They just announced all public schools to close March 14 to April 5th."
Interesting that Mirvish theatres are still saying that nothing is being cancelled.I personally would not consider being part of a large audience in an enclosed space right now.
"Most of my time is spent downtown. So far, not seen one person with a mask. Even in the underground 'Path'. There's a lot reported on the news. Local city officials are just warning people to be cautious. But if your staying in a paid accommodation, use your judgement."
Latest update on what's NOT happening.https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/mobile/here-s-wha…
"Still not that many people on the subway are wearing masks. It shows that people are heeding proper medical advice and not panicking.But, regarding toilet paper, just how many 24 packs do you need for a 14-day quarantine?"
I just bought 50 rolls of toilet paper. Top that RT
"To the OP, given the rapid increase of cases in your country, Europe, Canada, closure of many museums, reduction in international flights etc it may be prudent to consider cancelling your vacation now if you can without penalties ( flights/ hotels) and consider travel at a later time ."
"I was supposed to go to the Toronto Sportsman show this Wednesday. It's cancelled.I work at Walmart and it's like Christmas eve with the number of customers in the store. No grocery carts available and the parking lot is jammed. No toilet paper, hand sanitizer or Lysol wipes here."
"I have two in University, Ryerson and U of T and both are closing classes for the next while. Hoping it will not affect convocations. The malls were not too busy today, saw very few masks but people were using handicap door buttons more with their elbows. There is still no hand sanitizer but I picked up some cold-flu remedies in case. Some with Covid 19 suffer mildly so I figured may as well."
The paper towel aisle at Don Mills Metro was all cleaned out this afternoon and I have never seen that many shoppers in the store. Why the sudden panic today?
"@laviniamIt was crazy in the grocery stores on Friday because it's payday. No Frills was only letting a few customers in at a time because it's so crowded inside. No shopping carts at Food Basics (Loonie for a cart) so their customers came to Walmart to take the ""free"" carts.Edited: 12:54 am, March 14, 2020 "
I spoke with my daughter who teaches grade 7-8 in Toronto. She told me that some students who were taking 1 week vacations to the Caribbean for March break are now taking 3 week vacations so upon their return there will be no 2 week period of relative isolation in Toronto.
"Yes, there will be lots of people extending trips. There should be more screening at airports when they come back."
"Seems like its spreading out everywhere. I be worried to travel far away for 3 weeks. People might get stuck if the airliners pull the flights which might happen in some of Europe next week.I just seen that NY state has 524 cases of Corona. Ontario looks much better with only 101 cases but what is going to be the numbers in 3 more weeks ?? A week ago it was just a handful of cases. Lets hope the ""sun god"" will help to kill off the virus as spring comes along. The flu always fades away by late May. Ugh, thats 2 1/2 months from now. Seems to be the only hope out there.Edited: 4:17 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Somebody said does this mean read between the lines that more flights are going to be canceled or border restrictions. I saw this on the news ticker box on CBC and then looked it up on the net. So I would warn loved ones that are going away or have gone.https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/re…
I would strongly suggest that nobody think of leaving the country at this point. I saw that as well and the wording suggested they would seal the border shortly. I have not seen them seal the border since 9/11 but I am more than willing to have it happen now. My thinking is that if you are stupid enough to travel right now it is your own damn fault if you get stuck abroad.
It is crazy that anyone thinks that travelling out of the country is a good thing to do.Someone on a previous post had hoped for the virus cases to decrease as the weather warms up. Don't hold your breath (the pun is intended!). It is summer in Australia now and the cases are spiking there in the last few days.
"Currently Toronto(and surrounding areas) have many closures. Right now, schools and daycares along with city run recreation centres/libraries are closed for the next 3 weeks with an ancipated reopening of, April 6, 2020. Shortly after this decision many museums, tourist attractions and events deciedto cancel/close up for same period of time. Sadly the AGO, ROM, Casa Loma, CN Tower, The Toronto Zoo and many others are all closed. Ripley's Aquarium as of yesterday stated that they ae staying open, however that could change at any moment. If you are to come here, the only thing left to do is swim in your hotels swimming pool, go to the the Eaton's Centre/other mall during reduced hours, see a movie at Cineplex at reduced capacity(to facilitate social distancing),eat a a redtaurant, go for walk/hike along our valley walkways, and if you want to see a ""zoo"" than go to a grocery store to watch everyone panic buying anything and everything. I would also check for updated travel advisories and restrictions as they are changing daily; and our government is considering banning incoming/outgoing travel at some point soon."
"I would say things are not normal....not a lot of people in restaurants and stores...people outside.. All concert, and sport places, libraries, closed. And things will probably escalate soon. One really should not be travelling at the momment. And all museums and big galleries closed as well.Edited: 5:48 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Thank you. I work in the public sector, depend on public transportation on a daily basis, and I have an immunocompromised respiratory system (for which I daily take medications and have done so since diagnosis in middle age). I own a limited number of N-95 masks (since my lung disease diagnosis 8 years ago), and I'm not purchasing any more. I will buy a 100-count box of latex gloves specifically for springtime, because that's when I will not be wearing winter gloves while holding on to poles and straps on public transportation. ... So, while I am not living in fear, and while I refuse to live in fear, I really needed to read the infectious-disease physician's statement. Again, thank you for posting it on TA."
Landed at Pearson yesterday and I can confirm you were given a paper on which was info on the virus and being asked to self isolate for 14 days by Health Canada.
"Ontario has declared a State of Emergency....everything (including restaurants and bars) except grocery stores, pharmacies and essential services will be shut down to encourage self-isolation, and social distancing.Pick up and delivery of food from some restaurants is still happening....it is time to heed the global call to stay at home unless you are an essential service (and we thank you for all of your efforts on behalf of all citizens).It is also time to help others in our community who are most vulnerable to this virus (eg. offer to pick up groceries, meds, call to chat with neighbours who might be isolated, etc.)"
It is not everything except essential services. For a list of actual closures as of this morning please see the link below:https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2020/3/ontari…

Ontario Update today is devastating.
TRAVLYNMEHaving a loved one die of COVID is devastating Staying indoors is an inconvenience at best
Having just looked at a webcam of Niagara Falls & seen a boat heading into the falls I was wondering what sort of state of emergency would allow them to keep sailing?!
Caribana aka Toronto Carnival is now cancelled
"Rescueteam,good point,just such a surprise seeing the boat,now I think there was a lack of bright yellow ponchos on board!"
#69are you sure it was the LIVE cam that you saw  I cannot imagine a boat in the water nowhttps://www.niagarafallslive.com/
"Yes it was on earthcams,one of a number I look at daily(sad eh?!) as a trip down memory lane!"
"Hornblower (Canadian side) hasn't opened yet.https:/…Maid of the Mist (U.S. side) also postponed openinghttps://www.maidofthemist.com/Edited: 4:06 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"@71 I just took a look at the Eastham of Niagara Falls and saw the boat approaching the falls. I also noticed that the default view is an archived video, and the trees are in full leaf. Right now most trees in Niagara Falls are still bare. Earthcam says live feed camera is not available at this time."
"We are going to get some snow tomorrow, that is April as usual in T.O."
#71 interesting I looked at earthcam for yesterday & did not see a boat your eyes must be very good https:/…
Oh Wow! Tonight is the first night that has felt normal in a while. SNL and Tom Hanks looks great.
Your a day late.Maybe it made sense yesterday.
"No mystery.SNL = Saturday Night Live.Tom Hanks was the host. The show was a virtual one, with all the regulars beaming in from their homes.Nothing normal about it."
RBG on SNL getting down! Humour in the new normal.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
I have not watched SNL since the late 70's In the early years it was funny or I had a better sense of humour LOLPP you are not alone I have no idea what day it is been in self imposed lock down for almost 8 wks
"Just so everybody who doesn't have young people in their lives, you should read this and appreciate that students are suffering in this.https:/…"
