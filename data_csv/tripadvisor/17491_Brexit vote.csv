We are flying to London tomorrow and will still be there at and after the time of the Brexit vote on Thursday. Has anyone heard of any planned strikes or any other disruptions which have been predicted or which may occur either pre-vote or post-vote? Thanks for your help with this.
"No, all should go smoothly. If you are out and about on Thursday, polling stations will be open 0700-2200; you might care to take a look in, just to say you were there on an historic day. The one at Westminster Central Hall is probably convenient for tourists, and it's an interesting building with ace cafe, too!"
No news or plans for anything like that
A few more opinions - https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g186â€¦
There will be no immediate effecr whichever way the vote goes.
Thanks to all. Sets our minds at ease.
Whatever the result it is not in the British naturte to run around like headless chickens. People will carry on as normal - perhaps a few extra visits to the pub (by both winners and losers) for celebration/consolation. Vistors probably won't notice anything happening at all
We don't get excited.

"""A few thousand crazy England supporters who can't handle their beer have been getting over excited in France, and getting arrested.But they'll all be back in time to vote after Slovakia thrash England on Monday and Wales win against Russia! ;-)""You seem a bit misled Matt. Whilst there are tens of thousands of England fans in France having a fine time, not causing any trouble and enriching the local economy, the numbers causing any issues are no more than a couple of hundred and the number arrested only in the tens.And, even if England lose to Slovakia and Wales win, England are virtually guaranteed qualification for the next round."
">>> Has anyone heard of any planned strikes or any other disruptions which have been predicted or which may occur either pre-vote or post-vote? <<<No, nothing like that whatsoever."
Disruption to the TV programmes with coverage on the main channels from 22:00 to 6:00 and then probably nothing else talked about on the breakfast shows.
Sometimes folks thoughts go awry.
Stiff upper lip!!!
"Britain's restrictive strike laws mean it's effectively illegal to strike over political issues (as opposed to industrial issues between workers and their employer). So even if British people were inclined to strike over the referendum result (and it seems unlikely), they probably wouldn't because they could be sued and/or sacked as a result."
And if they did there would be no left to stand looking bored behind Johnson or Cameron on their factory visits.
"There may be uproar in Parliament if the vote goes against the government so you could plan a visit to the House of Commons, which can be the best free theatre in London, if you are here after the recess ends.If you plan to get any currency do so soon - if Remain wins the pound will go up."
"Whichever way the result goes, there will be brief mass outbreaks of "" tutting"" , followed by an epidemic of ennui, and then we will all go back to moaning about the weather.Nothing to worry about at all..."

"Wiper,I don't want to be controversial, but won't the same also apply for EU folks who have settled in the UK?"

"There is a strike planned for Tuesday, 21st June, on Southern trains. The conductors on the trains will be on strike, there will be some services running but will be very busy.This could affect journeys to/from Gatwick but the Thameslink will be running, as is possibly the Gatwick Express."
Btw it's not just a Brexit vote. We live in a democracy so we can vote to remain in the EU or leave it!Either way very little chance of disruption.Edited: 4 years ago 
"As primary schools are often used as polling stations you might find more young children out and about with adults on 23rd, this could mean places such as Natural History Museum are more crowded than usual."
The 24th could be interesting as there will be in depth analysis in the media as to what the result may mean. No one really knows and we have had for months are various theories to support either argument. The only disruption you may see is to the TV schedules. There may be some fall out polically depending on the result. The deep divisions in the governing party could turn nasty with a leadership challenge. Some are saying we may even have an election before Christmas. The best way to follow the debate is through the BBC news site as they present both sides of the debate impartially. As for strikes and protests then no nothing will happen. Its not the British thing. .

"Biggest protest that I can recall in London, was seeing a white dog with black spots, wearing a cloth sign proclaiming, ""Dalmations Against Cats,"" but that was about all. Maybe that dog will be voicing support for one side, or the other?In the USA, several news sources keep trying to fan the flames for ex-pats, but they keep replying, ""So what?""Good luck to all, and Ladbrokes is running 9/4 to Leave, and 1/3 Remain, if that means anything?Hunt"
I think the most felt consequence of the vote will be the Exchange Rate which might make things dearer/cheaper for you. Unless you already have stocked up on pounds in which case it's only going to be an economic opportunity gain/loss.
"You'd learn infinitely more about Britain by following Loughtonian's suggestion at #1 than by any amount of gawping at ""must see"" sights you'll inevitably realise no-one ever ""had to"" see.Access to polling stations is uncontrolled, and (except in a handful of places) blissfully crowd-free: we observe the queues to vote in other countries (even those where voter turnout is typically lower than here) with outright puzzlement. Usually, the polling clerks are so underoccupied they'll happily explain why there's no identity check here, no bureaucratic insistence on displaying entitlement, and why good old fashioned pencil and paper produces ballot results no-one disputes.Among those clerks' roles is to prevent attempts at influencing voters within the station: so don't try chatting to voters inside. It's completely legal (and common practice at normal elections) for party representatives to talk to voters right outside the doors.The management of polling stations is probably the perfect microcosm of our idiosyncratic culture. Far, far more revealing than pubs, fish & chip shops or choral evensong."
"For many years I acted as a polling clerk and it was all very civilised. I've never eaten so much! Poll clerks must stay in place from opening to closing of the station so I took snacks and lunch. Regular voters brought us casseroles, home made cakes etc and the police brought us fish and chips. Happy days! No idea what was happening outside though."
Well at least you don't have Compulsory Voting that's required in Australia. Failure to show up to vote for no acceptable reason means you pay a fine.
Bill hunt - next time you are in london I suggest you get out more or at least buy a newspaper.

"The exchange rate will go way up if the UK votes to STAY in EU, meaning that you will get fewer UK pounds if you exchange after the results are announced. However, if the UK votes to exit EU then the UK currency will plummet and you will get more money when you exchange.Personally I think it makes sense to wait to exchange as any savings (from brexit) will be eaten up by commission costs if you buy UK currency outside the country. But if you are a gambler then by all means place your bet on the futures exchange."
"EdT, it was t all fun. Someone I know was polling clerk in an area where most of the houses had been demolished. By 3pm they hadn't had a single voter. I guess the risk of trouble was most likely to be the result of the polling clerks going mad with boredom!"

"""no-one invests in uncertainty""Shrewd investors will be buying the right shares, I am buying.Baron Rothschild said, ""the best time to buy was when there is blood in the streets."" But don't invest in currency."
I think it's almost certain that there will be a drop in the value of sterling if there is a vote to leave. The only question is by how much - currently opinions stretch from 10-30%.What I think is less established is whether there will be a rise in the event of a remain vote. I suspect that there will be but only relatively small as there has not been a significant downward move as yet.
"To get away from arguments about sterling - I heard on the radio that the broadcasters are putting up outside broadcast positions at College Green as they do for the day after elections, can anyone confirm seeing them? If so, visitors going to see Westminster Abbey, HoP etc might want to go down there, more or less opposite the House of Lords end of Parliament (the other end from Big Ben) on Friday to see the media circus."
