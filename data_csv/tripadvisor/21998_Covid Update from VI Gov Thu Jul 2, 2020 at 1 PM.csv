"I'm confused. Does the rule of having to have a negative nasal test within 72 hours arriving, beginning July 15, apply to STT or just to PR? Thank you."
Just Puerto Rico
"As of today, only PR. PR has had a higher percentage of positives than VI."
"Puerto Rico but no word yet on whether visitors arriving in PR and switching 'planes to come to STT will be affected - and vice versa, leaving from STT on a commuter flight to PR catch a flight to the mainland."
"Is it anticipated that a negative Covid test will soon be required to enter the USVI?Edited: 11:57 am, July 01, 2020 "
"It will be interesting to see if USVI pivots and follows PR. I am scheduled to arrive on 7/14. My flight is on a Tuesday. If I was testing within the 72 hour window, it would need to be done, and processed, over a weekend which realistically just isn't going to happen. Last test taken in my family (out of curiosity and negative results) promised 72 hour turnaround - the results actually took 6 days. It would be better to just shut things down again as this 72 hour rule is going to be problematic - on so many levels."
"ACS33, the reason PR's requirements are getting attention in the USVI forum, is that due to the scarcity of flights scheduled this summer - particularly in July - availability of direct flights from the mainland to STT is limited for many. A good number of folks are forced to connect through PR to a Cape Air flight to STT. For many of those folks the next available Cape Air flight to or from STT forces them to overnight in PR.Although it's anyone's guess what the USVI governor during his address tomorrow remit new (or not) requirements."
"Hawaii has also implemented this policy. I’d be very surprised if we don’t see it for STT very soon, especially with how things are going in the States right now. I personally think it’s a good idea to help ensure that tourists are not bringing the disease with them. However, it is tough to get the test timing just right. Right now in Vegas the results window is 3-5 business days. What if you don’t get them in time? What if you get them too quickly and now are outside of the 72 hr window?"
"I tested last Wednesday and got my results yesterday after 5 pm. The first test I took was a Thursday noon and had the results Friday at 10 pm. So it's all over the place so if they put it in place, looks like I'll have to pay for a rapid test :-( I mean I get safety for sure, why I've tested and worn my mask to be sure. :-)"
This is an unscheduled press conference. I’m afraid we may have beach closures for the holiday weekend and bars shut down. He has hinted at both in the past. He noted that bars and restaurants are the two Types of establishments being highest risk.
"I just watched the Monday press conference with Governor Bryan and there were discussions of concerns about “super spreader events” such as a beach party on the holiday weekend. It seemed like areas of concern were focused on traveler screening at the airport, food service employees protecting themselves with masks and hand washing, and the general public wearing masks even while driving. Has there been any call for traveler testing before entry? Last minute testing could be problematic. There has to be enough time to get test results back."
"No official calls for testing before entry, but update tomorrow when things could change.There have been reports about some establishments not enforcing. I don't patronize those that don't enforce the guidelines."
"I will say, the few places we ate out at all followed social distancing. Morgan's Mango was excellent with it. At CBL, we were the only ones there and it is as open air as you can get."
"Well that would solve the tourist issue. Potentially No beaches, guess we will see tomorrow if this will be happening."
"Masks on STJ beaches could keep tourists home. We support the need for the island to be safe, but it’s hot in the summer and the crowds are lower than high season. Masks would make for tough breathing on a hot day at the beach. Our local state beaches are only allowing half capacity in the parking lot and eliminating street parking. That has been very effective at creating social distancing on the beach."

The Governor mentioned closing beaches ONLY for this upcoming holiday weekend and ONLY if on Saturday beachgoers continued to flout social distancing. Wearing of masks on beaches here is not yet a mandate but an advisory.
Just posted on Facebook:https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…
"Interesting on the new article. I wonder what constitutes early closures of the beaches? A late day for us would probably be 4 p.m.Masking on most STJ beaches is silly from a science perspective and the way we spend our time. In all our years of going to the beaches there, I can't remember being within 10 feet of anyone that wasn't part of our family. We seek isolation so set up with plenty of space normally. Now, if there were beach parties going on with everyone getting together in close proximity, that would be totally different. I just have never seen that in STJ. Maybe it's happening at Maho these days, but we've stopped going the past couple of years."
"Parkie, just sent you a PM"
“Mr. Bryan told the Consortium Wednesday that beach hours will be curtailed and bars will be closed early. “Limiting daytime beach hours could have the opposite of the intended affect. Visitors would be more concentrated on the beaches during the reduced hours of daytime access.Limiting after hour parties could be the goal. Thoughts?
Ahhh! We are going to St. John tomorrow! Anyone have any info on possible beach hours/closures. Yikes.
"Shutting the beaches down early won't really impact us as we tend to get in by around 730ish and out no later than 2pm. I guess it could indirectly be an impact as maybe folks who show up late might show up a little earlier but I doubt it.With that said what is the perceived benefit of this type of action as it pertains to the beaches specifically? I'm purely speaking in regards to St. John but I certainly don't see a bunch of unrelated tourist groups gathering together on the beach. Perhaps this measure is aimed either at other islands or locals who might be more likely to congregate on a holiday weekend?Edited: 9:14 pm, July 01, 2020 "
It’s more of a problem in st croix and st Thomas but if they shut down and St. John doesn’t than everyone comes over here. Also Sunday at hawksnest is always a party but that would be easy to manage
"@Tour - that's exactly what I was thinking. Probably STX doesn't matter because it's so far away, but definitely STT. Anything after 3 p.m. wouldn't impact us much, especially if it's just for the weekends."
"Can I just throw this out there? We have been in lockdown at home since March 1st. Didn't leave our house or yard except for groceries every few weeks. Finally our state began to lift the lockdown in increments and at that time we had to return to work although only 3 days a week. We have social distanced, worn masks, washed purell'ed and clorox wiped more than our previous years of life combined. And now, we were planning to wear N95 masks and do a ""lockdown"" at a house there in the USVI. We wouldn't go eat in restaurants or bars, carry out food or groceries only. We wouldn't go to a beach if it looked busy already... instead we would move on and try another. After being so careful for months is it stupid to think the islands will be open for visitors who intend to behave responsibly? Please maybe close the restaurants and bars except for carry-out. and mandate masks and 6, or hell 10!, feet distancing. but don't close beaches. The outdoors is the last place we have other than our homes. The only people catching it now here are people who thought phase 1 of opening meant the virus was gone. they had bbqs and played basketball, they went to movies and got haircuts. all manner of close contact activities. Don't ""punish"" the people who are understanding and following intelligent distancing and safety measures. Try to remember these new cases are following the opening of such places as gyms, for example. you know, where people breathe really hard all in a big room together? these spikes were bound to happen, but not to those staying cautious. be safe everyone and please don't close the beaches!"
There may be clinics in your area that do rapid testing. This is what I am doing to NYC; i found one that does a 24 hour turnaround. The 72 hour rule will definitely inhibit travelers. You can also get one at San Juan Airport....you may have to pay and turn around time...who knows.
"Thicket, where are you getting the 24 hour one in NYC? We live a little north but will be in NYC 72 hours before we leave."
Quarantine or Covid test just went into affect for certain states traveling to USVI
@Bjobe - Starting when and do you know what states?
where can I find a list of the states for quaranitine of COVID tests?
"I watched the news conference and it was almost like this was an afterthought - addressed in Q&A. It wasn't a main topic of the news conference. Evidently they are putting a list together. FL and TX were mentioned - but not certain if that applies to flights connecting through FL. No time frames were discussed. Perhaps the locals can clarify?Edited: 1:41 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"It sounds like it hasn't been finalized yet, but will happen. But, yes it was very vague.Edited: 1:50 pm, July 02, 2020 "

Agreed. I was like ok this isn’t bad and then the reporter asked the question and now I’m in a panic. Asymptomatic patients can’t get tested where we live.
Asymptomatic patients can't get rapid tests where I live either. I am not in a current hot spot but think this will likely be applied to everyone.
"Parts of the presentation was confusing. The part about the beach hours was straightforward, but I kept trying to read the bar charts to understand what he was really saying. (I was watching on the local government channel from the villa.)The part about the bars - was he saying that all bars would close at Midnight and stop serving at 11pm until further notice (i.e., close at 11pm today, close at 11pm tomorrow, close at 11pm Monday, etc.) or that as of 11pm this evening all bars and liquor sales would close until further notice (i.e., no bars open or alcohol sales after 11pm this evening, indefinitely)?and sadly, I thought it a bit cowardly the governor didn't have charts to address the quarantine for the 14 states, did not mention it in his formal briefing, and only mentioned as a ""oh i forgot"" during the Q&A."
We're in the same boat. Five of us coming on Tuesday 7/14 from NC. I don't know how we could get a test with results within 72 hours since results are taking much longer to come back. Not sure how or where to get a rapid test. I hope the governor will clarify this soon. Does anyone know if this would be enforced immediately or not?

"With such a lack of detail, I would have to think he'll be announcing the formal plan at his Monday address. That's the only thing that logically makes sense. It would be ridiculous to start it tomorrow without giving folks any chance to comply."
We were due to arrive 7/14 as well - for a short stay on island and then a catamaran skipper course. I've emailed the sailing school to see if they have any info. We will likely cancel if our dates are impacted by the requirements. We've been calling every testing center around and not one can guarantee rapid results or results over a weekend (unless you are symptomatic).
We are scheduled to arrive on the 14th and head straight to our chartered catamaran also. We are coming from Florida so we will obviously need a test which isn’t a problem but the timing of the results is a problem. I wonder if staying on the catamaran for our entire trip would be considered quarantined. We only plan to snorkel and swim and eat every meal on the boat. I hope by Monday we get clarification.
We can’t get tested here if we are asymptomatic. We are due to arrive July 14. How can he put a statement out like that and then offer no further details? And it was like an afterthought anyway.
It is definitely upsetting not knowing with an arrival date so soon. Since PR isn’t starting this requirement until July 15 I would think that that there would be some notice before requiring it in the USVI. I guess we have to wait until Monday to know for sure.
We arrive Sunday from Iowa. Would love to hear any info from anyone on St jOhn or what you are hearing. We are not in a hotspot where we are at. Did the beach hours change or restaurant guidance? Thanks so much for any news at all.
The Governor clearly said that right now a list is being compiled of the states with the highest positive rates of infection and that travelers coming from those states (he mentioned Texas and Florida as examples) will be required to carry with them proof of a negative test within the past 72 hours OR be subjected to 14 days quarantine.Obviously this isn't going to be put into effect today or tomorrow and plenty of lead time will be given once those states are identified so that travelers from those states can comply. This is simply a pre-warning of what's coming down the line. When more information comes available you'll be notified.
"rluther8 - As of right now, I believe beaches close at 4pm over the holiday weekend, and bars close at midnight from here on out, and alcohol can no longer be served in any establishment from 11pm onward.Waiting on specific details on the proof of negative test/quarantine requirement."
"The directive on beach hours is for this dual holiday weekend only, Friday July 3rd through Sunday July 5th. Locals and visitors should be off the beach by 4PM (start packing up by 3PM) and the beaches will be off limits until 6AM the following day.From today until further notice all bars are to close by midnight and there will be no liquor sold after 11PM. The 11PM mandate includes all liquor outlets - bars, restaurants, convenience stores, etc."
"It will be interesting to see how this works related to connections or even flying out from a different state from where you live? I would think where you live would be most important, but who knows.Edited: 5:32 pm, July 02, 2020 "
We are always off the beach by 4 for a couple of reason. 1. No seeums start getting really hungry about that time. 2. Happy hour is kicking. I haven’t seen midnight while on island for many years. Early rise early too bed. I’m ok with these restrictions. I do have a question related to social distancing and capacity. Are the bars being compliant with these regulations? I for one can have my happy our by the pool but would like to spend some money at our favorite bars. Anyone seeing places that are not playing along?
"Apologies if this has been addressed already, but is the nasal swab required or will the antibody test be sufficient?"
"TxSunny21, this has not yet been noted. Nothing will take place for at least a couple of weeks but there will be plenty of lead time and details to come soon. The list of states involved is being made up and the list may be available on Monday during the Governor's next scheduled address."
"jmass, we just got back last week and walked past Woody's once and folks were all over the place (not hard to do there since it is teeny). We only ate out at MM, CBL, Rhumb Lines and Pizzabar. None were overly crowded IMO. There were a few crowded together at Rhumb Lines, but they were together and there was plenty of space around everyone else. Everywhere we went seemed to be doing a really good job."
Thank you STTresident. We arrive July 12 from Texas. I have called around and cannot find anywhere that will promise rapid results for the swab test.
"Yes, thank you STTResident. We were trying to figure out how to get test results back for a Tuesday arrival on the 14th. I’m anxious to see what the governor says on Monday."
"It's funny that this was an afterthought in the Q&A, but it is the lead headline on VI Consortium. Kind of a big deal to not have any details or timeline for more details. The Consortium even calls it the biggest of the 4 announcements."
Is there any indication that this will be affective immediately on Monday. Has anyone heard when the pretesting rules will begin? We arrive Thursday and need time to arrange testing.
Tena - I suggest waiting to see what the test requirements are. In Puerto Rico they are very specific about which type of test is required.

"For what it's worth, the rules for Maine specify that the sample itself needs to be taken at max 72 hours before arrival. I am not sure if USVI will have rules that are similar. It makes turnaround time next to impossible if you want to get tested before your trip, unless you live somewhere with on site rapid testing.Edited: 1:27 am, July 03, 2020 "
"I myself haven’t been in town or to any stores or beaches since March 12th, but my son who is 19 has been giving me reports. He works at Morgan’s Mango and I know they are taking all measures seriously. I find comfort that many of you have reported the same in your trip reports! At some other places he’s said it can be hit or miss. He’s been home early many many times because he said town was too crowed and people were walking around without masks for his comfort level. I too wish the governor would have been more thorough about the testing and quarantine requirements or just left it unsaid until it was finalized. Also should be noted is the huge jump in pending numbers."
"I sent the USVI Government House Facebook page a message last inquiring about the implementation of the COVID-19 testing policy. I woke up this morning to their response: Good evening. There is no official policy in effect regarding COVID-19 testing for visitors coming to the Virgin Islands.In his response to a question from the media, Governor Albert Bryan Jr. mentioned a number of issues that are part of an internal discussion regarding visitors traveling to the Territory.The additional protocols mentioned by the Governor have not been implemented.Government House regrets any confusion that may have resulted from the Governor’s response."
"@Williamsfamilycov. Thanks for the update, like so many others I have started to panic as we are scheduled to arrive on 7/13. My hope is that everyone will remain vigilant as it seems based on the Governors address most people are following the suggested guidelines. I agree most people in my home state as well are doing their part to keep communities safe. As many have said we basically socially distance on STJ as part of our vacation, Really the masks and in service restaurants will be the only difference. If I can help the island economy and bring some much need peace to my soul safely for everyone, I am in, I just hope that tourists will still be wanted."
"Julie, I did not know your son worked at Morgan’s Mango. I will have to look for him next time. There was a nice young boy that brought us our food from the kitchen and helped with my order, maybe it was him. I can tell you Morgan’s mango is doing it right! They are excellent all the way around."
Yesterday was a rollercoaster with that off-hand announcement. Sounds like there is no immediate threat of that policy being implemented. We're scheduled to arrive on 7/15 so it looks like we'll be fine. My wife and I have decided to get tested for COVID-19 anyway before we leave just to be safe!
"Mattdad-it’s so complicated. I admire that you want to keep the island safe. One dilemma is that you can have a positive nasal swab for the rna, have no symptoms, and not be infectious. My understanding from numerous medical lectures for months(correct me if I’m wrong) is that weeks after you’ve had the infection you can continue to be a carrier with non-infectious material.  I wonder if a two-step test makes sense for travel. 1. Test once two weeks before travel and there’s a high chance that you’re not infectious anymore “as long as you have no symptoms”2. If you test negative 2 weeks before travel, repeat the test a few days before travel and cancel if you’re positive because you were likely just exposed. It’s not perfect. This doesn’t even cover the 70% sensitivity of the test. There’s a high false negative rate.Edited: 11:53 am, July 03, 2020 "
"Everyone is acting like rapid tests are easy to get. I can't just walk into ours here and say, oh, I'm leaving the country so I need to be tested. That's a denial for the test. I had to answer specific questions to determine if I was even eligable for testing, let alone the rapid test and I stretched the truth to get approved for a test and that was after I was exposed long term by someone so it's not as simple, everywhere, of going and getting a rapid test.I'm not coming if I feel sick or fear I've been exposed and I totally understand the need for it but it's not as simple as going to the pharmacy and saying test me now and I want my results in 15 minutes."
"AlexA, I believe you are correct. For our inpatients that need to go to a nursing home/group home, 2 negative tests are required. We have had completely asymptomatic patients held for weeks trying to get negative tests....daily tests for weeks....and of course, all count as positive cases.If you aren't in that position and tested positive (or think you were) with symptoms, you can be around others when ALL three are met: No fever for three days without taking anti-fever medicine, respiratory symptom improvement, and 10 days have passed since first symptoms.If you never had symptoms and tested positive, you just have to wait 10 days to go in public again."
"MS - here in MA my parents got tested so they could go to maine to see my sister. If they didn’t say they have symptoms they would have to pay $160 each out of pocket for the rapid test. So since they had allergy symptoms they were able to get covered by insurance. And we have a high test rate in MA, can’t imagine how people in other states will do this. I distinctly remember our president say anyone who wants to get tested can. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. And if travel is going to force it then we need better services."
"I believe he said anybody that NEEDS a test can get a test. That makes a difference. Just like I cannot go get some blood test because I want one, need a reason.If they are going to implement wide ranging requirements for tests for people who are asymptomatic or not in need, just because the states or territories are requiring it, then they will have to alter their criteria on how tests are ordered. They may even have to consider having that be completely out of pocket as it is not a healthcare need for the individual."
"snorkeler, that was probably my son :) He is food runner at Morgan’s Mango. Luca has been working there a few years now. Prior to that he worked at Lime Inn for a season. I read on the VI Consortium that tests for travelers may be offered here upon arrival as well. There are certainly a lot of unanswered questions at this point. We just had another big spike in positives territory wide. 111 total positives now as of 7:51pm VITEMA alert on 7/3/2020"
Most of the positive cases are on St Croix and are mostly people who work at the refinery. Many of the workers come from TX.
"In light of the announcement yesterday of a large uptick in cases (11 on STX and 2 on STT), the DOH is referring to it as an ""outbreak"":https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…"
"Julie, problem with doing tests is that you can test positive for weeks after no longer needing to quarantine (per CDC guidelines) yourself for infection.Of course, there is the risk of exposure after test that you bring to the island. A lot can happen in 72 hours, esp during travel."
"The CDC website state that ""a postive [COVID-19] result could mean that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called Coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold. This is alo contributing to the rise in ""infections"" numbers. The death rate is not rising, which is great news."
"We are also supposed to arrive July 16. There is no way you can match a 72 hour timeline. I am in FL, there are drive throughs but their turnaround time is 5-10 days for results, so how do you know which day to pick to go test? Also no rapid test anywhere near here, also if you go to a place like CVS you have to answer yes to specific questions or you are not eligible. I listened to the video and found this website where it does state that Texas and Florida will be on the list. https:/…I hear a lot of people saying he will clarify on mon the 6th? So we are probably not going to be able to make it since Texas and Florida and definitely mentioned. I also am curious about the antibody test, now that one I have schedule for the 7th and would have results back by the 16th. Again almost impossible, too many variables to get a negative result for corona virus test if it has to be within a certain amount of time. And again just because you tested negative one day does not mean you cannot be positive in 2 or 3. Travel would have to stop completely if have to follow those rules. Seems like the only way would be to require testing upon arrival but who really can quarantine for 14 days away from home if asymptomatic and then test positive.I also left a message on the government house facebook page earlier today, won't get an answer until Monday I presume."
"There is so much great information in this thread. It goes to show how vastly different each state and area can differ. The more I think about it, the more I think the requirement of testing is almost just shifting the focus... instead of the government saying there can be no check-ins (local government shutting us down) they are now saying you require testing in a way that pretty much strongly discourages or makes it impossible for travelers to come (now it's someone else's fault and the local government didn't shut us down). I only can hope that the local government has been keeping close tabs on all of the many many questions people have and do a thorough reporting on Monday answering all of the questions."
"Julie, those are my thoughts exactly."
"I see that Ann, who has 9 total posts to date as of my reply, posted ""THIS POST"" on eight other TA island forums this morning... Most of us are very aware of the opening timelines for St. John, as well as the other islands we have interest in. Oh, that Grand Cayman info doesn't really hold true for ""tourists"" - and what is the ""with restrictions"" after USVI - according to Govt House, no restrictions are officially on the books as of today.Edited: 11:33 am, July 05, 2020 "
"Nor were Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands ever closed. On July 15th PR is mandating negative Covid-19 tests for entry to the commonwealth by all travelers and the USVI is also working on a similar plan, details and effective date not yet known. But neither were ever closed as they are US holdings subject to Federal law which forbids closing of borders without specific Federal permission which was applied for by PR (not by the USVI) and rejected.The other islands are foreign jurisdictions and have their own laws."
