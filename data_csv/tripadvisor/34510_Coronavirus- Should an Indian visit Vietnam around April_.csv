"Hi,Any experience of Indian visiting Vietnam during February 2020 amidst Coronavirus outbreak?"
"irutuk, you really have to make your own decision about travel anywhere at the moment. It is a changing situation and none of us can know what the situation will be in April. Hopefully improved."
Thanks
"Wrong advice ! The Viet Government took very strict measures immediately, including banning flights with China on Feb 1st, everything is back to normal, (except no Chinese tourists, so, less crowd everywhere) nothing is closed except schools until the end of the month, less and less people wear a mask and everybody is very happy to be here. Risk infinitesimal, COME HERE !!!!!!"
"jacques, my advice was not wrong. I advised the OP to make his own decision as to whether he should plan on travelling in April. Neither you, nor I or any of the experts know what the will be happening in April. If any of us travel, we have to be prepared for any and all possible scenarios, including the illness being even more widespread worldwide."
"""jacques, my advice was not wrong.""Correct, Sue.Jack lives with rose coloured glasses on, and just can't accept any comment that he sees as a criticism of Vietnam.Regardless of whether it is, or not.Scott"
"Been in Vietnam for almost a month now, traveled from North to South and the virus has not even appeared apparent! It's less crowded at the attractions which is actually a good thing! Obviously there are cases of the virus here, as the case for alot of countries but unless something drastically changes for the worse, there is no reason not to visit!"
"OK, sorry, wrong expression, but it remains that Vietnam is much safer now than..; France or Italy, where my rosy-colored glasses do not seem to work. NO reason not to come here, except fear distilled by the media, with articles from journalist who are not even here, people who live 15 000 km away but are sure that they know the situation here, including some members of this forum (not you !)"
"Oh Jacques be nice. Was just thinking of visiting the beautiful province of Dak Lak ? All sounds good where you are, Lak lake, BMT and the national park which I think is called Yok Don plus I was told there are some nice waterfalls on the Lao border.Just as nice and better than India ( my opinion ) You could easily get sicker in India even without the virus. Check the stats."
you should wait if India has a out break they will close the boarder today sth Korea is close in vietnam
"You won’t hear any bad news such corona from India until next 24 hrs, air force one take off:)Edited: 10:47 am, February 24, 2020 "
"The coronavirus situation is much better in Vietnam. I heard that nearly all the coronavirus cases in this country have recovered. According to CDC, Vietnam is affected by the coronavirus at level 1, meaning that the situation is not serious.You can read more here https:/…vietnam"
"Newspaper Courrier du Vietnam of 28 February (my translation) :The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) has decided to remove Vietnam from its list of countries presenting a risk, saluting the efficient fight of the country against the epidemic of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)."
"I don’t even think Vietnam has ever been under the watch of CDC; I left the HCMC last week, made a short transit in Hong Kong and then arrived in US soil. It was pretty cool and easy passed thru US immigration. They are more concerned with me carrying meat products and fruits/veggies at customs. I brought 7 lbs of legend Vietnamese coffee and no problems!"
Are you saying that the CDC does not know what it is talking about and that their announcement is not the truth ?
"Hello,From the CDC website:""CDC does not currently have a COVID-19 travel health notice for Vietnam.Travelers should always avoid contact with sick people and clean their hands often by washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%–95% alcohol.Visit CDCs webpage for additional information about COVID-19.""https:/…index.htmlMany Vietnamese news agencies reporting the status change as of Feb 27th.Safe travels ✈️"
"Well... if I knew CDC will quarantine 14 days any US citizens recent travel to Vietnam like mainland China, then I would not even dare to leave the country; Mainland China was placed on the restriction on January 31st if my memory serves correctly and Vietnam was never mentioned at the time. And I left on Feb 13 to Vietnam, still never make it on travel ban. Now, South Korea, Italy and Iran are on the list of limit/restriction ban. Again, Vietnam is still freebies."
