"We're finding it difficult to deal with these Travelgenio ""agents"" and their automated responses. It has been a frustrating experience these past 3 weeks since my first attempt of contacting this company.We were on our winter holiday and our flight was supposed to have left on April 4th from Bangkok to Munich but we have not received any official flight cancellation from them or Emirates. Due to this uncertainty we had to find other ways to fly back to Europe.After receiving another standard reply from an employee named ""Francisco"" in the last days, I have decided to take this case further. First I was told by Francisco that I should contact Emirates in order to get a partial refund for the outbound flight that was cancelled but then Emirates informed me that Travelgenio is the one and only responsible party to deal with cases like this even though your employee did not seem very informed and up to date with the current policies.We have paid the total amount of 1184.35 EUR on 03/06/2019. Excluding the inbound flight already taken, we expect an accurate and detailed partial refund from you of an amount in the range of 590 EUR for the following ticket numbers:Ticket: 176-3604694777Ticket: 176-3604694776Travelgenio booking: PKW7B4Emirates booking code: BLL2HJ I would appreciate an official response from you until the end of next week in order to finally settle this case.In case we still do not hear from you until then, we have no other option but to take legal action together with our lawyers and also will have to raise a dispute with our bank to recover the funds. This obviously would be time consuming and I'm sure both of us would prefer not to go through such process.I expect you to proceed immediately with a partial refund to the same CC used on the initial booking ending 0878.We look forward to hearing back from you soon. Best regards,HR/AW"
What made you choose a bottom feeder like Travelgenio? Why not throw your money into the fireplace? Soon the Travelgenio bot will appear saying that they are there to help. But that might be as far you get for months given there are hundreds of dissatisfied clients trying get their money back from Travelgenio.
"“In case we still do not hear from you until then, we have no other option but to take legal action together with our lawyers ”This always works."
"That’s a good idea, throw good money after bad.Take the time to read all threads about TG, your situation is not unique. Read them as it save continually writing the same replies.You do know this is a public forum, you are not addressing TG?"
"100 other threads here about TG. Starting a new thread means that future visitors find a five post thread instead of the 2000 post thread that will better warn them away from this company.Check the other threads, as TG has a rep who posts here daily. Lots of info that might help.I doubt you will like the answers, but you chose an awful company to give your money to, and that’s on you for not researching first."
"There are hundreds of threads on places. like this telling you not to book with these agents and yet you You either didn’t bother to research or. didn’t believe them. So why do you think your announcement that this is bad is going to help?Apparently there’s an unlimited supply of people like you who are convinced they found a cheap airfare fairy and just handover the cash to an unknown company without doing any research.There is no cheap airfare fairy, and if you can find this forum to complain, it’s hard to feel sorry for you. Apparently you had the skills to have done research before you gave away your cash"

'I have decided to take this case further.' I suggest you look in the mirror and have a talk to the person there.'we expect an accurate and detailed partial refund from you of an amount in the range of 590 EUR for the following ticket numbers: [redacted]' Oh. 'I would appreciate an official response from you until [sic] the end of next week in order to finally settle this case.' You won't get it.'we have no other option but to take legal action together with our lawyers' If you do this - and the consultation will be expensive - you should be prepared to give honest answers to the questions 'did you read Travelgenio's terms and conditions?' and 'did you read the terms of the tickets purchased from Emirates?' If you did neither of those things then putting several hundred dollars in a shredder will be cheaper and quicker than the unproductive talk with your lawyer.
"First off your legal fees will be more then your flight, and your lawyer will take 20% of your refund, if you get it. Like the above comment if at any point Travelgenio points out that any of this was in their TOS your SOL. Honestly if you had done any research on Travelgenio before booking you would not have booked through them, Emirates does business in every continent, on a normal day they have thousands of passengers many of whom this virus has disrupted their lives its not your fault, its not the airlines fault, its not the booking agencies fault, we are in a global emergency. I presently am a expat living in Asia I have a ticket home for Thanksgiving, Emirates has been nothing but flexible with me stating if its not safe for me to go to the US by November I can use the ticket on a later date...like all airlines they have no obligation to deal with passangers who booked through OTAs and have issues with the OTA...your wasting your lawyers time if you go that route you have no case sorry!"
Hello Snoop. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days. Thank you for your cooperation.INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"Oh dear, probably the millionth person to book with them and have a problem.Do let us know when your lawyer gets the refund you desire."
"Snoop - you have had lots of replies saying the same thing - you do not have a case to go to court with . You need to sit down, read the T&Cs you signed up to , realise how little you will get back eventually when you get a reply and do not throw good money after bad trying to sure them Sadly YOU chose an agent which is known to charge large admin fees and is often slow to answer calls etc even in normal times - these are not normal times so all your empty threats will get you nowhere fast and you will have to wait your turn like everybody else .Edited: 4:27 am, April 09, 2020 "
"I actually feel sorry for Travelgenio. Not the greatest but probably not the worst either, stuck in a country with some of the worst C19 stats and some of the most idiotic 'customers' in the world. Time for a mercy killing."
They were shoddy before Covid19 reared its ugly head so they're just worse than ever.
"There are two types of lawyer:One will offer you a free initial consultation, then advise you to save your money as you don't have a case.One will make it clear from the outset that they charge by the hour and each individual correspondence has a fee of $95. You will recognise these as their car will be biggerm their office flasher and their suits sharper. I hope you choose your legal representation more carefully than you choose your travel company.Edited: 4:47 am, April 09, 2020 "
"I expect they will google and pick the one that looks the cheapest, then be posting on LawyerAdvisor about how they got scammed and ripped off"
