"Also Croatia Airlines continuously operates Zagreb - Frankfurt route throughout COVID-19 pandemic on a daily basis with increase on double daily flights since May 25th,"
"Hello, our flight is scheduled for July 3 - Toronto- Munich (stopover) -Dubrovnik with Lufthansa. Any ideas as to whether this is likely? Thank you"
"Hello J-MOT, in case Canadian citizens can enter EU borders by July the 3rd and in case Croatia is open for tourists that day, then yes - highly likely. Otherwise no. We just had dozen Covid-19 cases on flight en route Frankfurt a. Main - Zagreb incl. them pilots among infected ones. All passengers were ordered in isolation. No idea how government will look at tourists coming by air. Nobody knows when and how will Croatia open its borders. I am following closely the entire situation because of my ""maybe coming"" guests. Hope everything turns out good. Stay tuned."
Thank you very much.
