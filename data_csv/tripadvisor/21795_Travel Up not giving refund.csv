"I was due to fly out from London Heathrow in late March to Phuket and coming back at the end of April however the flight was of course cancelled due to the Coronavirus. The travel agent which I booked my flight with has said that they will give a full refund - this was back on the 28th of March when I received the email saying ""We have cancel your booking and process for the refund as per your email request"", to date no money has been received. I have also tried to call Travel Up on a number of occasions and after waiting on the phone for 4 hours the call cuts out, I have also sent a number of emails requesting for an update on the refund or at least for them to confirm the date by when I should expect the refund for the Thai Airways flight. At least if they could confirm a date I could raise a dispute with my bank to get the money back but Travel Up are not responding to anything so I am suck for options now, this is £490 which during these times is very much appreciated. What can I do to get my money back? Has anyone else received any refunds from Travel Up?My opinion is that they don't want to give the date of when the refund can be expected as any dispute with my bank the company involved will actually my charged etc, any thoughts?"
Travel Up have not covered themselves in glory with the whole CV19 refunds situation but I suspect your case has been exacerbated by Thai who have stopped all refunds whilst they try to restructure and stave off bankruptcy. Travel Up are very unlikely to refund you until Thai refund them.
"Sorry, your last paragraph doesn't make any sense. If you paid by credit card, contact your card provider and get them involved."

Did you read any of the other threads here about this company? They've been bad a very long time.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…
">>>My opinion is that they don't want to give the date of when the refund can be expected as any dispute with my bank the company involved will actually my charged etc, any thoughts?<<<My thoughts are that I think it's more likely they can't give you a date because they don't know when they will get the money from the airline, as T_U has already pointed out.Sorry, I can't work out what giving you a date has to do with you disputing the charge with your bank/card provider yourself."

"Thanks for the info/ advice guys. For my other two flights which I was able to successfully raise a dispute with my bank for I had to wait until the date quote on the email from the travek agent was reaches before I could raise a case with my bank. So they confirmed via email I would need to wait 8 weeks so I waited that long and because I never received the refund after that timescale was met I contact my bank and was able to raise a dispute as goods/ services not received. The only confirmation I have from Travel Up currently is that they will refund the money but no date specified so how can I raise this with my bank as they as when the refund was said to be received, currently the timescale as infinity. All I want travel up to do is say a date whether this be wrong or not then I can raise a case with my bank and get the money back, this has been going on since March! Very poor level of service.What's your advise, can I go to the Financial ombudsman? I expect they will also want to see somthing in writing from Travel Up confirming a date as well right?"
"don't wait, they know how long you have to file a dispute and they will likely try to make you wait until it is too late to file.Tell your bank they refuse to provide a date, and send copies of your correspondence as backupEdited: 2:36 pm, June 09, 2020 "
"That's a good idea, I will try this again tomorrow and see what my bank say. I do understand however that I have 2 years to raise a chargeback request with my bank though right?"
"Ask them. I doubt it's 2 years though.(The financial ombudsman would only get involved if the bank/cc refused you a chargeback and you wanted to dispute the decision IME).I should add that due to the problems mentioned in post 1 and the complications of having to go through an agent, you might not get a chargeback or a decision in your favour. You will have to be patient. Even direct customers are seeing long delays in getting refunds.Edited: 3:07 pm, June 09, 2020 "
Don't know where you are so can't tell you for sure. In the US it's a much shorter time frame
Most of the airlines now takes 4-6months to refund back money.Mine they call it 4 working cycle means in months and they even said that it might took longer because of the volume of refunds. Hope you get yours soon!
