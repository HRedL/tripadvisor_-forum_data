"Thanks for the update, this is what I found following up a bit:Less than 800 new cases of chikungunya in a week: the epidemic in sharp decline PAPEETE, February 13, 2015. Four months after his appearance on the territory of the chikungunya epidemic loses every week a little more vigor. During the first week of February, the Health Surveillance Bureau has recorded fewer than 800 new cases in all of French Polynesia when, at the peak of the epidemic in early December 2014, there were 9000 new cases per week. The decline of the epidemic is increasingly obvious over the weeks since the end of last year. Only the Austral recorded at the beginning of February more new cases than the previous week (250 against 160). Even the Marquesas still account for nearly 400 new cases since early February, the trend is clearly downward. The decline of the epidemic that has significantly slow down expectations in hospital emergency departments should not hide another phenomenon, that clinical signs with severe joint pain that persist or come back in people who have been affected by the chikungunya virus. These persistent joint pain affect about half of the people who have been infected with the virus in the previous weeks. The subacute form which occurs between 21 days and three months after the first signs is common. Although the pain is disabling or violent, they do not reflect a new infection: these people are therefore not contagious to those around them. If pain persists beyond 3 months in contrast, believes that people are living with a chronic form of chikungunya causing the joint pain regularly. tahiti-infos.com/Moins-de-800-nouveaux-cas-d…"
