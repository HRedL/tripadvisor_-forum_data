1. I bought tickets from travelgenio (from KUL to TOKYO without cancellation protection) on early Feb. The departure date is 7 April. If the flight is cancelled by ANA themselves will i get the refund from travelgenio ? 2. is there any possibility that ANA will choose to postponed the flight but not cancel it? 3. can i directly arrange my flight with ANA KL or i can only do that with travelgenio ?(travelgenio is not responding any of my emails)
You might be better posting this query on the Air Travel forum for a better response.
1- You should do2- Well not really. Flights aren't really postponed. They might be delayed for a few hours. Otherwise they'll be cancelled and you would ordinarily be put on the next available flight.3- You'd probably have to make any amendments through Travelgenio. Minor things like seat and meal selection can probably be done through ANA's website.
"As you bought your tickets through a third party ( Travelgenio), you will need to deal with them not ANA.If your flights are cancelled, any refund will be paid to Travelgenio. They will then refund you less any charges you agreed to in their T&Cs when you purchased the tickets."
"My experience with Travelgenio is that you will need to ring them to get a response. They may very well then try to make you run through a million hoops to get your refund. Be persistent. If the flight is cancelled, Travelgenio should contact you to let you know."
"If ticket bought with credit card, you can get refund from credit card company if flight is cancelled."
"hi, thank you for your information ! they really help. Travelgenio will contact by call or email? if the flight is cancelled"
"6. They should contact via email, keep an eye on your junk mail folder.Edited: 3:39 pm, March 21, 2020 "
