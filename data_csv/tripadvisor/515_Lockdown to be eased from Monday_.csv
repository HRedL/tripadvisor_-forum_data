"BoJo will make an announcement on Sunday as to what changes will be introduced from Monday, but I'm not sure there will appear to be any difference. I was in the city yesterday and there is plenty of traffic on the roads and lots of people walking around, many taking photos. So I think lockdown may be lost on many people.I found this video (not mine) of what London is like right now for anyone who hasn't been out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFFgtkIffB8&feature=youtu.be\Edited: 8:05 am, May 07, 2020 "
No has yet told the governments of the world that the lockdown is over.
>>No has yet told the governments of the world that the lockdown is over.<<What does that even mean..........?
"John, Iowa isn't the world."
It’s pretty simple. You can order people to stay home but eventually they will start to try and resume their routine. The poster noted they were seeing people and activity all over London.
"John there is always going to be people and traffic in London. Some people could be coming and going to work, health services have community teams who have to travel to see patients and some may be taking exercise. Among that there will be some Iidiots who are out and about when they shouldn’t be but they will be in the minority and certainly won’t be going on with things as normal. How can they nothing is open.I do hope however people don’t jump the gun this weekend and try to come to rural areas. The police have warned they will be out in force looking for them to send them home"
"Cuomo noted yesterday people sheltering at home made up over 60 percent of new cases while people out working in stores, nurses, truck drivers etc. were not so seriously impacted. No one yet knows if clamping things down was the correct response."
Can't speak for Central London but where I am on the fringes the traffic is extremelly light. Quite a few people out taking exersise and obeying social distancing. Did have two idiots in the queue for Costco stand directly behind me for some odd reason. I had to tell them to move further away.By and large it is working where I am.
I would suggest that people do not jump the gun over any announcement until we hear what is being said.There are more people around nut looking at those in cars they are often driven by a sole person so either going to work or shopping because many are avoiding public transport.I am never sure bout John as you cannot compare Iowa with the UK but seeing has never done one TA review he probably has never been outside his own state.
"Sorry, I should also have said that apparently the Scottish leader is not planning any drastic changes which could make it difficult for Boris to make England different"
"I think nurses, doctors and care workers have indeed been seriously impacted as I have personal knowledge from my colleagues and family. The other person in my family who has had the virus is a key worker still going out to work. Those of us who have stayed home haven’t had it."
"Ash not sure why you think insults would bolster your position. However, if your assumptions regarding the extent of my travel are so far off, misguided and completely wrong one can hardly give one shred of credibility to your opinions and especialy how to address the virus."
"Don't expect too much easing from next Monday.A 5 stage ""exit strategy"" apparently to be revealed on Sunday.Looking at September possibly for re-opening of pubs and restaurants, but with strict ""self distancing"" in place.All will be revealed by PM (hopefully !) in next Sunday's statement.Stay safe all !"
"Here is a wee question? Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister for Scotland has just announced at her daily Briefing there is to be no let up in the Restrictions in Scotland!Now let’s assume that as widely reported, Boris Johnson the Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, announces on Sunday, a partial easement of the Lockdown, no matter how small, how does that work?Last time I looked, my Passport said I was British, any official Application Form that has ever asked me my Nationality, it’s always British, every Census Form I’ve ever completed my Nationality is listed as British, if we ever get into a Conflict, it’s the British Armed Forces that will protect me.So that begs the question? Does that mean that the rest of the British Population can start getting back to some sort of normality whilst 5.46 Million Scottish residents are held under strict Draconian measures?Regardless of your Political persuasion, but didn’t Scotland vote to remain in the UK in 2014, didn’t the UK vote to leave the EU in 2016, what I’m saying is collectively we are British, how come a small percentage of the population are being treated differently?Let the debate begin."
@13 Why do they get free prescriptions in Scotland but we don't in England? That's devolution for you
"Bungle I know how devolution works.However this is different, this is a “National” problem!So, someone who lives within striking distance of the “Border” can nip over and enjoy a picnic somewhere scenic on the English side!Equally, someone from England drives over the Border into Scotland and could be stopped and Fined by Police for doing something they can do freely on the English side!It’s nuts!Ms Sturgeon has an Election in exactly one years time, I think she should give that some thought when making these decisions!"
"#14 simple. I pay a higher rate of tax than my colleagues outside Scotland. This helps increase funding to the NHS including prescriptions. We pay for it. Perhaps ask Westminster why they treat you differently, or would you rather not have the tax increase.Edited: 9:47 am, May 07, 2020 "
I’ve been told all my life that socialized health care is free. What’s going on here??
"""many are avoiding public transport""When I am out walking the dog I have yet to see any passengers on a bus."
"madscotsman115 , what you are complaining about is happening all over the world in countries that have a federal system. Every single state in Germany, every single province in Canada, has different lockdown rules. So why should England and Scotland not have different rules?"
"#18 - Do you think there's a magic money tree that drops cash into the NHS ? You really should do some research and find out how the NHS is funded before spouting your usual rubbish. As for people moaning about the First Minister leading the country in the way she thinks is best, well that's what she's supposed to do. I'm sure the Prime Minister is doing the same. Apart from ignoring social distancing, contracting the virus and leading the UK into the country with the most deaths in Europe. Who needs a lockdown ? Good luck everyone. I think we're going to need it."
">>I’ve been told all my life that socialized health care is free. What’s going on here??<<Then (as I suspect you know full well) you've been told wrong. A national system for health care can have whatever features the country in question chooses, of course. The common feature is that it's available to all on the same terms (usually little or no cost at the point of use, as a result of most or all of it being paid or subsidised out of taxation - all pay in what can be afforded, all can use it as they need it). In this particular case, a small fixed fee for prescriptions was introduced nearly 70 years ago, but it doesn't apply in a great many cases (people on low incomes, children, the over-60s and the chronically sick, and people in hospital), and the devolved Scottish government chose to abolish it."
We don't have the most deaths in Europe actually.
"#23 Yes, we do. Prime Minister presides over the UK, not England on it's own. Mind you, give it a few days...."
"From my own personal locked down bubble.I suspect lockdown is being eased already. Round where I am it was eerily quiet to start with, but there's a bit more traffic around now, the occasional parked car that wasn't there before. I can see at this moment a neighbour and someone with a bike chatting in a garden. Probably safe enough, I'm not losing sleep, but . . .And let's remember, for all the deficiencies in the numbers, and the increase in testing, that when lockdown was announced the number of new cases was under 1000 a day (currently between 4000 and 6000 a day, and has been for quite a long time). Deaths had barely reached 100 a day.If you meet a stranger next week the chance that he has coronavirus is considerably higher than it was when lockdown started. I'll be doing anything they let me that doesn't involve contact with other people. And nothing else."
"No we don't actually: https:/…And someone explain to me why there is so much emphasis on numbers of deaths so far, like it was some sort of competition, for a crisis that is a long, long way from being over............Edited: 10:34 am, May 07, 2020 "
">>And let's remember, for all the deficiencies in the numbers, and the increase in testing, that when lockdown was announced the number of new cases was under 1000 a day (currently between 4000 and 6000 a day, and has been for quite a long time). Deaths had barely reached 100 a day.<<Because there is a lag between people becoming infected and when they actually die. They are also counting deaths that were not being counted before. And ramping up testing is obviously going to dramatically increase the official number of cases. And let's be clear they were be lots of people who became infected that never showed up on the stats.The lockdown was never about totally stopping individuals from becoming infected anyway. It was about protecting the NHS from overload."
"Bungle, seriously my friend, read the article you posted a link to and compare it to what I stated. You are comparing completely different data to what I stated. I have never made death a competition. My concern is that any relaxing of lockdown rules will cause an increase in infection and death. That is not acceptable. When you read some of the posts in the UK forums where people think it is ok to travel hundreds of miles to get fish and chips, pick up an adult daughter from university, buy a car, buy a handbag (seriously, google that one) I despair. No matter what I do to adhere to the government direction, there are so many people who don't give a monkey's. That, sadly, won't change.I will continue to work from home - yes, I'm lucky that I can - avoid unnecessary contact with others and adhere to social distancing and basically do what I'm told. Probably for the first time in my life."
">>Bungle, seriously my friend, read the article you posted a link to and compare it to what I stated. You are comparing completely different data to what I stated.<<No I'm not. You're just twisting the facts for shock value. If you take into account population size (which you have to do for the stat to mean anything) , the UK does not have the most COVID-19 deaths,and that is a fact. And there is the fact the different countries are not even counting them the same way!And where I say that you personally have turned it into a competition? Everyone is doing it! The fact of the matter is death totals matter not a jot until the thing comes to an end.I'm not sure what the rest of that has to do with the conversation? Most people ARE following the guidelines.And I'm sensing you're another person getting a little hysterical over this. Over a disease that for the vast majority of people is nothing more than a few days of felling unwell.Edited: 10:51 am, May 07, 2020 "

"We have to return to normal at some point. Lockdown was to stop ICUs getting overwhelmed, not to stop us catching it. Hospitals are now running at their lowest occupancy rates for many years. We can't stay in lockdown until there's a vaccine or it dies out. That could be never. The economy can't sustain this for many more weeks, let alone months or years.There's a lot to be said for healthy people starting to ease out of lockdown. People who are vulnerable by health or age, or just plain nervous, can continue to isolate, but the rest are needed to get the country back on its feet. I'm expecting to catch C-19 at some point. It's fairly inevitable. Hopefully it won't be worse than the flu, but I'll have to take my chances.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52543692Edited: 11:07 am, May 07, 2020 "

"@30 Yours show that you are completely out of touch with reality. COVD-19s case mortality rate is 0.66%. 80% of people infected can manage their symptoms at home...if they even have any. So why are perfectly healthy people acting like they're going to drop dead the minute they set foot outside of their front door?People have got this idea the lockdown is some magical solution to make the virus disappear. It's not even close to being that. The virus is going nowhere, lockdown or no lockdown."
@31 Exactly. The government is set to have spent over £30bn on the furlough programme by June. That sort of spending is not sustainable in the long term.
"#17 John S. Iowa The health system here is not free, most employees pay National Insurance, an additional payroll tax automatically deducted from their pay cheque, the employer also pays a mandatory NI contribution. This is in addition to income tax, which for most employed persons is deducted at source plus general taxation, when I renew my car insurance policy and there is always an insurance tax premium added to this."
"Seems to have went a bit astray!My question was about should the different constituent parts of the UK move at a different pace?The Furlough Scheme is a prime example!Say the Treasury decide that it only ran for 3 Months, and Scotland (or Wales and Northern Ireland) decide to keep Lockdown going longer, then does those Devolved Governments promise to keep the Furlough Scheme going on their own? What with? Monopoly Money!It was in the News today about how this is going to effect us financially (Recession Etc) and it was said that this is going to cost each family £9000, hell, I lost that the first week off my Pension Pot! I reckon I’ll lose the same in earnings this Tax Year, and no I can’t be Furloughed!So it’s got to end soon, as that article reveals, a high number of the Population are self isolating for no reason!Flak jacket and Tin hat firmly on!"

If we come out of lockdown and the R figure rises back above 1 and infection rates increase Then we would be going back into lockdown. Many people wouldn’t accept it Many others would not trust the government regarding calling the lifting of the second lockdown This would increase uncertainty and cause further damage to the economy
"Sadly, considering how much many of us have given up to keep ourselves and others as safe as possible, in town today there was a surge in cars.Don't think they were local as all coming off the main road. Too many to be coming all at once from villages.Not a parking place to be seen.The police are out in force now. They probably know something we don'tI think that something should have been announced the beginning of this week as originally promised. It's taken too long to get the info on what happens next and people are doing whatever they like.Good luck to the person who thinks they are young and healthy and want to take their chance. I see this as the next stage in the virus spread. I'm fit I'm fine.............obviously don't read the reports."
"I agree Toopaz , I live on a main road and six - seven weeks ago people were jogging down the middle of a usually very busy road for the novelty of it. If someone walked towards me on the same pavement I would step into the middle of the road.These last two weeks and this week in particular the traffic roar is back and it’s constant. Very busy again even right now early evening The press have been running articles about lifting the lockdown and dropping hints and it’s encouraged some people to start believing lock down doesn’t matter and they can start mingling again.And tomorrow is going to be warm and a bank holiday Just watch the spike in 7 -10 days time !Edited: 2:21 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"Regarding the disparity between England rules and Scotland rules, does Scotland have less in the way of hospital facilities where critically ill people can be treated? Just curious. I live in the United States which is pretty large with huge differences in population in regions and even within states so one size does not fit all. I live in a rural county with 7 identified positive cases but (then) only half of one percent of the population have been tested. There is a great deal of anxiety manifesting itself as ( fairly obnoxious) bravado because the promised money/relief has not yet found its way into bank accounts and those folks living paycheck-to-paycheck are feeling it after 50+ days of enforced isolation. Conspiracy theories abound. ""Hoax"" is a favorite description. And while many of us are eager for a vaccine, an equal number of folks are already saying they refuse to take a vaccine if and when one becomes available. By this time we all know pretty much where we stand --- on the sidelines wondering if our ""camp"" is the one to be in. (attempt at humor). All I'm trying to do is respect ( by keeping my mouth shut) the opinions of others while remaining optimistic regarding easy and accurate testing which will make it ever so much easier for larger family and friend groups to socialize more freely. That in and of itself will make this all more bearable. Stay well, everyone."
"Because it's come up and not been answered, here we go. The lockdown restrictions have different legal bases for each of the four jurisdictions in the UK (political, not legal, so counting Wales separately). In Northern Ireland, for example, the legal basis resides in an act of the old Northern Ireland parliament, abolished in 1973. For this reason, Westminster has no authority to legislate except by consent of the Scottish/Welsh Governments or Northern Ireland Executive. This is why Nicola Sturgeon has already announced a 3-week extension, and why restrictions in Wales were *increased* a couple of weeks ago. It's also thought that NI may align itself more with the Irish government, despite what Westminster politicians may say."
"At the start of the lockdown I could walk to the end of my road and cross the main road to get to the railway station without having to wait for any cars to go past because there was zero traffic.Now there's a steady stream of traffic and I have to wait to cross the road! There's also more people on the train to and from the city centre because a few more businesses have reopened. I can't think of any other reason to go the city centre, unless you want to go to one of the 10 Tesco Express shops within one square mile of each other! There's more people pottering about the city centre (where I still have to go to work). I get the feeling that some are a bit bored and are just having a look around to what isn't open; which is pretty much 99% of the shops. It's the mingling that bothers me, plus the people who completely ignore the 2 metre rule, and the people to which lockdown never existed.My neighbour is still taking his bike for a 3 hour drive every day. Drive as in, sticking it on his bike rack and going off into the countryside!"
"Leuca. What is your location? I live inside the M25 close to the M1 and another major trunk road. The traffic appears to be marginally higher but I stress ""marginally"". The traffic is still extremely light.Still a lot of high powered motor bikes taking advantage and using the roads where I live like race track though."
madscotsmanIf England scraps the furlough scheme but scotland want to continue it then yes it will have to be financed from Scotland's funds.If you ever get independence you will have to finance everything yourselves anyway
"My location?Similar to Matt’s in the outer suburbs except I ama bit further out and I concur with Matt’s post, except I haven’t ventured out at all except for my daily toddle but the last three days I have just stayed doing my garden , but the traffic is building and also the number of people out walking"
"It's not practical for lockdown to continue for much longer. It's not possible for Wales to fund a furlough scheme, as the Welsh government has already said.That said, I don't have nay problem with a phased and gradual easing of what we've had since 23rd March. There won't be much in the way of organised gatherings, theatres, cinemas pubs and restaurants are all likely to be the last things to reopen. As long as no vulnerable people are forced to go and interact with those who may be unwell without realising it, I have no issue with healthy people going to work again.The lockdown worked in as far as it bought time to set up extra hospitals that haven't been needed so far, presumably thanks to the way the vast majority of folks co-operated with the advice to stay at home.What I hope we don't have is a repeat of the scenes of packed tube carriages in London, or buses and trains everywhere as was the case between 13th March and 23rd March."
Agree with RojblakeBut how can people get to work by public transport and self distance and how could it be enforced.Answers to Boris Johnson on a postcard please
"That's a good question. I guess that at least some of those who can drive instead will do so, particularly outside of London where I'd guess that there is a greater degree of car ownership.We'll have to wait and see what Boris says, but given what's happened so far I'm not expecting a huge amount of clarity."
"""But how can people get to work by public transport and self distance and how could it be enforced.""There is no one to enforce it on the trains or buses. But fortunately hardly anyone is using public transport at the moment. Yesterday my train home from Lime Street was cancelled so I had to get the bus. As you know, buses are a lot smaller than trains, with a narrower aisle and seats a lot closer together. Fortunately there was hardly anyone on the bus, but I did take a big, deep breath as I got on and made my way to a seat right at the back, trying not to breathe on anyone! What I'm worried about is if Bojo and his circus eases the lockdown too early you'll have a lot more people using the buses and trains who aren't necessarily using public transport to get to work, but for non essential leisure travel."
"Some thoughts on what people have written on this thread.1) Why were certain right wing newspapers with an agenda headlining this morning that we were coming out of lockdown ? One suspects that either they were briefed by a libertarian member of the cabinet (Gove is a likely suspect) or they were pushing their own views which seem way beyond what the majority of the public want as regards freedoms. The letters page of the Daily Telegraph is simply full of people who would rather live free and die than accept another day under lockdown.2) Around Watford traffic increased the week after the school holidays but seems to have remained at that level since then and I can still drive from Watford to Northwood during the middle of the afternoon in ten minutes without breaking the speed limit.3) Jon of Iowa enjoys showing off his wilful ignorance. Don't feed the troll.4) As Mark Twain said there are lies, damn lies and statistics."
"Health care is devolved so Scotland can do it’s own thing on that. Security isn’t devolved. Is the reason that the devolved governments can choose a different approach on lockdown, because this is viewed as primarily health."
"Agree with Adam that we're not actually ""coming out of lockdown"", we're just having some restrictions lifted. I gather that National Trust staff have been told their properties' gardens will open from 18th May, but on timed entry tickets - that's the sort of change we're looking at initially, I think. The big push is bound to be getting people back to work. The idea that it doesn't matter how much government borrows, whatever you think about it in normal times, is not sustainable in a time when every country round the world wants to borrow at the same time as many large companies want to shore up their balance sheets by raising extra share capital. For someone to borrow someone also has to lend... I imagine that there will be a big uptake in people walking from the london mainline stations to their place of work, plus a continuation of a lot of WFH for those who can and staggered workdays for those who can't. The big question has always been whether you think it is realistic that we can have a vaccine before most people who were going to catch the disease had caught it anyway; ie can we actually keep infection low enough at the same time as maintaining an economy that allows us to function. I've never been convinced that we can, so see it more as a question of not overwhelming the health service as we all steadily catch it. The story we've been telling over the past couple of months is different, I'm not sure it actually makes it true."
"Adam, re. the Newspapers this morning.Regardless of which end of the political spectrum the British Press finds itself, the fact is, to a man, all the front pages carried the story that things were about to “loosen up”So either someone in Government “tipped” them all off, or they are all guilty of copying each other!As it turns out after Today’s Daily Briefing, maybe, just maybe, someone in Government was leading the Press a merry dance, as it now seems there will be little changes, if any, to the Lockdown!"
"#46 All I can say is in SW Herts, as Adam Hornets said, it is up ever so slightly but stil minute to compared to what it normally is. Instead of being like 6 am on a Sunday morning in the middle of the day it is now like 8 am on a Sunday morning. Overflying aircraft from Heathrow are almost non existant. I saw my first aircraft yesterday in weeks. Just come back from taking the dog for a walk and just the odd car heading north up the M1.I am also at a loss to see how they can even partially take the lock down off in London. There has been talk of staggered working hours and encouraging people to work from home. But how do you do that and maintain social distancing on the trains and the underground. It is a joke."
"How do you define ""too early"" to lift lockdown? The government aren't concerned that people will get ill, just that they aren't ill enough to need hospital admission. Lockdown in its present form has done its job. From now on it's social distancing which will reduce infection rates, and this will continue to ease as long as infection rates don't rise too quickly. Not that they won't rise; of course they will. My organisation has already told us that we'll carry on wfh for the foreseeable future, and we may have to book a desk if we want to go in. There's absolutely no benefit to my job in physically sitting in a shared office. We had a hot desking system, and frequently latecomers had to work elsewhere as all desks were taken, and limited parking, so it solves that problem. That aspect of many office jobs will, imo, be here to stay."

"A quick look at the Guardian website and it seems that politicking, jockeying for position, displays of ego, and 'I'm in charge here' behaviours are the order of the day for many in positions of power. Dear oh dear.Inspector Knacker claimed the lockdown could be 'unpoliceable' next weekend, almost as if daring for it to become a self-fulfiling prophecy. 'The letters page of the Daily Telegraph is simply full of people who would rather live free and die than accept another day under lockdown.' I'd say leave them to it, but their actions could have an impact on others.We've had just under 4 million confirmed cases around the world and let's say another 10% to 15% who've contracted the virus with mild symptoms and recovered. Life has gone on for many of us and as such it's tempting to want to return to normality as the sky hasn't actually fallen, but I don't think it's quite time to do that yet."

"@76 Define ""a very low level""? What if that takes months and months? We can't wait that long. The effect on the economy has to be considered. And there is the mental and health aspect, and risks brought about by the lockdown itself.Edited: 9:55 am, May 08, 2020 "
It is so reassuring that we have a Government that right on the ball and knows exactly what they need do instead of bumbling around like a bunch of baffoons. They have got us to second in the league. That is good isn't it?
"78 of 79 ·@76 Define ""a very low level""?""As I understand ""the science"" the R (Rate of re-infection) level needs to be below 1 consistently, ideally below 0.5.At the moment, the ""R"" level in the UK is apparently somewhere between 0.75 and 0.90 and rising !!!Stay safe all !"
"Perhaps, in the UK, we should keep all the present ""lockdown"" restrictions in place, coupled with the ""social distancing"" rules, until 60m+ people have been tested and found to be clear of the virus; or until 60m+ people have had a vaccination ... which ever comes first? I'll float that suggestion.Anthony K"
"While the rate of reinfection (R0) is connected to the number of infections it isn't the same as it. If you have 100,000 current infections and you have R0 down to 0.5 and keep it there, you are, broadly, going to get another 100,000 infections in total (50,000+25,000+12,500 etc). If you have a current infection rate of 100 and an R0 of 1, you are going to get a further 100 infections every two weeks or so, although admittedly ad infinitum if you don't do something to get R0 down slightly below 1. I know which I would prefer...In a phrase I very rarely find myself using, I agree with Bungle... You can't look at this without considering the economic cost, and it's not heartless and unfeeling to do so. Somehow this has all got to be paid for, and the usual argument of tax-the-rich is even less relevant with the numbers involved here than usual. The government is currently borrowing £180 billion (about £3,500 per UK adult) over three months on the bond market, more than it originally intended to raise in the whole year. Arguably the only reason the market is happy to buy it is because the Bank of England has correspondingly announced £200 billion of gilt purchases in quantitative easing. Stripped of the comfortable jargon, what that means is that the Bank of England is electronically printing £200 billion in funds out of thin air, giving it to the financial institutions in return for current government gilts (debt) and then the institutions are using slightly less money to lend back to the government in buying new gilts.So really the new funds haven't been raised in the market, they've been printed by the Bank. Do that too often and a) it stops working and b) it leads to a potentially lethal circle of inflation. Either, or both, could lead to some appalling losses of life and health over many years."
"Astolat, you say - ""The government is currently borrowing £180 billion (about £3,500 per UK adult) over three months on the bond market, more than it originally intended to raise in the whole year.""If that is the case ... should not the Chancellor announce that to the HoC whenever it becomes a borrowing decision, by the Government.Anthony K"

"Covid-19 is not the only story in town. Non-covid deaths in the UK are also at a higher level than average. This is partly because people are not presenting to hospitals because of a fear of contracting covid-19, but also because routine screenings, tests and in some cases treatments are not taking place leading to underlying health conditions not being treated. It's all very well to say we should all stay in lockdown indefinitely to protect the NHS, but unless we get some economic activity kick-started soon there may not to be enough money to keep the NHS going anyway.Edited: 12:26 pm, May 08, 2020 "

"Sorry if this is off topic, but it relates to the Virus and care.If we are moving toward a situation where beds in Hospitals are being freed up, but cases of Covid-19 and deaths from it are still increasing in Care Homes, is there a good argument against moving elderly Covid-19 sufferers from Care Homes into Hospitals?Thank-youAnthony K"
"Possible, if all elective nhs surgery and treatment of patients with life threatening conditions, cancer, heart attack, stroke etc is abandoned."
"#89 No, absolutely not. Firstly, those beds are needed to clear the backlog of elective surgery which has been cancelled. Secondly, acute hospitals are the worst places to be for anyone with a low immune system. There are more virulent hospital related infections than C-19.What is needed (and being planned/implemented) are specific step down facilities where vulnerable patients discharged from hospital can quarantine for 14 days before returning to a care home. If the care home already has cases, not much can be done except let it run its course."
""" If the care home already has cases, not much can be done except let it run its course.""Are you a Tory Minister?Anthony K"
"'If the care home already has cases, not much can be done except let it run its course.' I can't speak for marshmallow999, but from my perspective I'd say more a realist than a Tory anything.When I worked in hospitals we had spates of infections, often noroviruses and Clostridium difficile. Usually by the time the first diagnosis was made others would have had symptoms and/or tested positive. Despite treatment for C diff and isolating persons with norovirus, ultimately the wards would be closed to admissions or discharges with no visitors allowed until the organism was cleared.All staff from cleaners to consultants stepped up infection control procedures and carried on working because there was little else to be done. With no new hosts norovirus petered out and C diff went back into hiding.There needs to be a balance found between people going back to work and reducing coronavirus transmssion as much as possible, ie to continue physical distancing and good hand hygiene. Austerity is a killer as well - not as publicly as coronavirus but it is lethal and as such we need to find a safe way to restart the economy."
If this is anything to go by what will happen after relaxation of the lockdown and we have to commute by train in London https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…
"Although we would all like an easing to the lockdown rules from Monday I don’t see it happening.New Infection rates are still close to 5,000 a day and over 4,000 people have died in the past 7 days, surely therefore too soon.Expect Bojo to follow Wales and say everyone can now go out for exercise more than once a day but nothing more than that. I suspect there will be a message to employers to get ready to reopen for business in the coming weeks and what is included in each step of the 5 stage plan will be interesting to see.The whole idea the media had about picnics and sunbathing, would be a complete disaster. It would give far too many the green light to meet up with friends in parks and other green spaces for beers and socialising."
"I walked to my local high street today to pick up some healthcare and DIY supplies. From what I saw, you'd think the restrictions had been eased, so I guess whoever briefed the press has now set up the expected eventuality that the restrictions will be extended and it'll be our fault, rather than the fault of government policy."
"Another one to add to the list of things I don't understand.Supposedly the big problem in care homes is people being discharged from hospital to their care home and starting an outbreak. But surely these people were admitted from the care home in the first place. They may well have infected others before they showed symptoms. Even after they showed symptoms they may not have been isolated as quickly as they should have been. The one time you would think that isolation would be rigorously enforced is after they have been discharged from hospital, when it's definite that they have had it. The damage was done earlier."
"A lot of older people are admitted to care homes temporarily after being discharged from hospital (although it often becomes permanent), either because home care can't be sourced or their frailty has increased to an extent that they aren't safe to go home and they need a few weeks of accommodation-based reablement.Edited: 3:44 pm, May 08, 2020 "

"'How does the Government explain away, after 6 weeks of lockdown, 5000 infections a day? Social distancing can't be working.' Without having seen the data, I suspect physical distancing has little to do with the numbers.Citing X 'new cases a day' doesn't indicate whether those are persons with active disease, persons who have recovered from the disease, or currently persons who have antibodies to the virus. More testing is going to show an increased presence of the virus within the population if one considers those who've been in contact with it and remained asymptomatic or slightly symptomatic as well as those who may have had illness seconday to the virus two months ago but are only now being tested.Without robust antibody tests and separation of total number of cases (actively ill, recovered, asymptomatic etc) it's difficult to do much more than look at the total number of cases and be worried even though the information in that total number isn't especially helpful.For my part I'll continue physical distancing and very frequent handwashing."
"They have only ramped up testing since the end of April. Two weeks ago they were testing less than 20,000 a day now they are up at around 80,000-90,000. The official number of new infections before the ramping up of testing would have been far fewer than the actual number. Hopefully now that they are testing considerably more people the number of new infections should be a lot closer to the actual figure.The fact that hospital admissions have fallen dramatically is a good indicator that the current restrictions are working but the numbers of new infections and deaths are still too high to allow for any significant relaxing of the current restrictions.Edited: 4:14 pm, May 08, 2020 "

"'Can anyone explain to me how sitting on the breakfast sofa is ""essential""?' I'll have a go.I suspect ITV would consider their staff essential not only to dispense the news (although what Piers M dispenses is something else entirely) but to ensure eyes on the channels and as such revenue flow to the company from adverts on GMB and more. In short, the presenters are there because ITV really wants money.Other journos - and there are those who can gather and assess information rather than just read an AutoCue - are essential in order to try and keep readers and viewers advised of what's going on. Whether those persons are revenue-producing or add value to the licence fee is an aside, but journalists and reporters do provide a service that's much needed now in order to try and discern the wheat from the chaff (as it were)."

"The argument above over whether TV presenters are or are not doing “essential” work is irrelevant - there is no such requirement in the U.K. guidance.

One of those is to go to work when the work can’t be done at home, and it’s then up to the employer to institute safe working with social distancing - which for TV presenters means doing their own makeup and sitting on separate sofas. There have been occasional admissions by government ministers that actually the stay at home mesage worked better than they thought it did, and combined with the economic insulation of furloughing for many (not all), it’s resulted in much more of the economy shutting down than they expected. The real problem may be getting people to accept that they have to take a level of health risk (especially if not in the high risk groups) to get the economy moving again."

Hence the likely encouragement to use face coverings, not because they work, but because they may make some people feel safer.There is a sensible balance to be made now for those at low risk of serious illness, and those who should continue to take more precautions."
"I certainly agree about needing to restart the economy as soon as it is safe to do so. I suppose my argument is why, when so many modern garden centres are akin to department stores, the focus is on them rather than other elements of the economy. The economy is very important for all of us, but so is human touch, company and ( dare i say it) a little joy in our lives."
"Akin to department stores? Your typical garden centre is a wide open space full of plants.......And have we forgotten the story a few weeks ago about garden centres having to dumpy all of their stock?Edited: 6:53 am, May 10, 2020 "
"""Hence the likely encouragement to use face coverings, not because they work, ""Oh yes the Government is still sitting on that fence on that one. How long does it take for a scientist to determine whether a mask helps or is completty useless. Or is it that they know and the the government cant make its mind up."
"Akin to department stores? Your typical garden centre is a wide open space full of plants.......—————————My two nearest garden centres sell furniture ( indoor and outdoor) , clothes , shoes, craft supplies, toys ( indoor and outdoor) , greetings cards , pet supplies , tools etc . They have a cafe and yes, quite a lot of plants outside. Also quite a few plants, seeds, plant food etc inside. So yes, quite like a department store imo. I should make it clear, I’m not objecting specifically to garden centres reopening, I’ll be glad to get some compost, but I am puzzled as to why they in particular are being singled out. I’m simply pointing out that the policy seems rather incoherent."
"That's the difference between a garden centre (all things for your garden and outdoor living, aquatics, sheds and conservatories) and a nursery (grows and sells plants). The nurseries with a few polytunnels and open spaces are usually cheaper than garden centres with buildings and cafes to maintain, and staffed by people who understand soil and growing. I head for the latter. I'm just not sure how my nearest one, which has only ever taken cash, tots up the total with a pencil on a bit of cardboard, and rounds up or down to the nearest pound, will adapt.Edited: 8:24 am, May 10, 2020 "
"According to someone on FB, the problem is that independent garden centres are in potential deep financial trouble having been forced to close, where as the big stores are trading freely and have been given a monopoly on their specific market."
"""Oh yes the Government is still sitting on that fence on that one. How long does it take for a scientist to determine whether a mask helps or is completty useless. Or is it that they know and the the government cant make its mind up.""I hope they make their minds up whether or not we will need to wear face masks to travel on public transport or to even leave the house, as has been the case in other countries. Where are we going to get these face masks from? I doubt the bumbling circus will provide them, so we will end up having to buy them ourselves online or from a shop, by which time the prices will have been hiked so that they become unaffordable to most people. P.S. my neighbour has just taken his dog for a walk again, in his car. And he did the same yesterday. I also saw him take his bike out again on the back of his car. Who was it that questioned me the other week and said ""maybe he took his dog to the vet?"". Well, the dog must be very sick if he has to drive it to the vet every day! Imagine if we were all as selfish as him and decided that the lockdown rules don't apply to us!Edited: 8:38 am, May 10, 2020 "
"Why is it brilliant, that someone might be known to the poster, just not ready to say the name...just like with my garden centre.....got the info from FB"
#165 - That did make me laugh too.A lot of the big trade only nursery are struggling at the moment. I can't see any issue with garden centres being open. Same restrictions as supermarkets and diy places.
"As you can see the gummint and scientists are not in agreement and as much in the dark as your typical citizen. I tend to believe each person is responsible for protecting their own health by either avoiding risky situations or accepting the fact they may be vulnerable even if others are not following ""The rules""... Or especially if others are not following the rules. Problem is, no one knows what the rules are. I do not recall a pandemic or health disaster in which healthy people are quarantined....usually sick people are told to stay at home.."
I am sure a face mask must have some benefit but the Government know we need a hundred million available before they say put one on
"@165 Well they said they have been ""contacting the government on this"", whatever that means. But the explanation does make sense and fit in with the facts."
">>I do not recall a pandemic or health disaster in which healthy people are quarantined....usually sick people are told to stay at home..<<That was the original plan though, until someone worked out that it would result in many more deaths.>>I am sure a face mask must have some benefit but the Government know we need a hundred million available before they say put one on<<A hundred million? The population of the UK is only ~60 million."
Stay Alert. I don't want to be a lert. They're rubbish. I want to be a ware. Wares are much more fun.
"You would need many hundreds of millions if everybody was told to wear face masks. Each person would need at least two masks per week. That is the rate of use in South Korea.Edited: 9:32 am, May 10, 2020 "
"I think quite a lot of people able to do so are making fabric, reusable, ‘masks’ but you’d definitely need at least two in order to launder them appropriately."
And then there would be a run on elastic...
I had an hospital appontment last week and was suprised at how few face masks were being worn there
">> change my Boxers and socks daily, if you think I’m keeping a mask on for a week then think again<<You're not supposed to wear it there."
Ian Thank you for explaining to Bungle that we are likely to need more than one mask.Those who do not go out might not need one but others may need manyI will remember to spell it out next time
It will be optional so the huge numbers being quoted will not be required.
"You can get reusable one, right? So they can be washed."
People in Korea get / buy mask in packs (don't known how many is in a pack but it looks a fair few ) from the chemist's at different days of the week depending on the last digit of your birth year. I think it's a months supply.
"'I am sure a face mask must have some benefit' Yes, with a few caveats.Health care professionals find disposable mask is useful when doing procedures or when transporting someone with a known respiratory illness. The N95 masks when fit tested are very useful but should be left to those who need them, say when intubating someone.There hasn't been consensus from any government body about whether masks would be of benefit at this time because there isn't yet solid evidence to say yes they are. They may slow transmission but equally could act as reservoirs for the virus, and since few people know how to don and doff them correctly they may end up being more harmful than useful.Disposable masks are nonrecyclable plastic waste which hasn't been taken into consideration. That a fair bit of time, money and resources are being put into manufacturing masks so people can wear them on their chins or foreheads - about 50% of those seen in my area of the city in the last week - should be considered as the time, money and resources could be better spent elsewhere.The 'stay alert' faff - what the actual [redacted]. We're to be on the lookout for something that can't be seen, smelled, touched or identified on naked eye examination. Brilliant."
"Hi TP on the money again.In the U.K. there could be I infected person out of 300.If 20% of the population disregarding youngstersThat could mean 10 million masks being worn at anyone time. And that’s millions being discarded as opposed to being disposed of properly and safely.That could mean 25,000 contaminated masks after each “ wear “.Every few days thousands of contaminated mask left lying around or dumped in bins just like litterEdited: 1:57 pm, May 10, 2020 "
Nothing about garden centres at all.......
"No, nothing, but the garden centres must have had information of which we don't know anything...I don't think Boris was particularly specific. Perhaps after tomorrow's briefing in the Parliament."
But he did mention the quarantine but didn't say when it would start.

"I was expecting the message from Boris to be confusing, and my expectations have been met."
We will find out in due course.
"He needs to give shops an idea of when they can reopen, such as opticians, hairdressers and book shops can reopen on 1st June, clothes shops can reopen on 15th June etc.But no, he just bumbled along, waving his hands about and basically told nothing we don't already know!"
"At least in England, the message is that we can go and drive anywhere we want as long as we respect social distancing (from next Wednesday)"
so we can drive to a self catering cottage?
"Very vauge today. So can I now drive where I want, when I want? Can I drive to the coast and sit on the beach? Go for a walk in the New Forest? Needs to be clear before Wednesday or it will be chaos at the end of the week."
"But you can't go to Wales or Scotland....but in England, as far as I understand, you can go anywhere you like as long as you maintain the social distance, and don't use public transport......so if I fancied going to Brighton beach, I have to drive.Edited: 2:44 pm, May 10, 2020 "

"Boris said specifically, you can drive to other destinations....so that's means anywhere within England. And if the rate of infection increases, then the the restriction will return."
I’m expecting a lot of people to drive to Cornwall which increases the risk for the rest of us here and also means we are pretty much stuck where we are

"This as was said by the police, will be impossible to police.Too much too soon. There should be a limit on travel.We've had teens off school and mostly stuck at home who will be in their cars. on their bikes hightailing round the roads, others in vehicles as often and as much of yet a lot will be stuck indoors with a lot more noise and fumes.And yes, if the weather improves I expect the town to be heaving with day trippers despite the 'essential travel' that's negated by the 'travel to other destinations for exercise'Terrifying if you live somewhere people will flock to and isolating because the stores will be busy and sell out.And as for one nation expempt from quarentine - words fail me."
I suspect the government are breathing a sigh of relief that the temperature for the week ahead is expected to be well below average.Goodness knows what he thinks will happen tomorrow on tubes and buses though.
"Indeed Adam. Where we have the problem of our food being raided and the bug spread again, those in town have the transport problem and the bug spread again.Nothing has been done to wait until as much protections as possible can be put in place.That;s why, when so many have worked so hard and given up so much to get to this point it's infuriating when it looks like it's all going to be shot to smitherenes for the sake of a few weeks!"
"If you would like to rewind to my Post @15!So a Scot living within a short drive of the Border is free to go anywhere in England for any reason (picnic, sunbathing, beauty spot).But could be arrested if they don’t cross the Border!"

"#210,not 'anywhere in England'. We're only allowed to drive somewhere local."
"#207 << There should be a limit on travel >>Wholly agree. It would be much better if it was stated as something like ""not more than N miles drive away from the driver's home location for exercise"".N could start at say 10 from Wednesday and be (conditionally) increased to say 50 on 1 June and so on. Impossible to police, but it would give a better indicator to the majority who do abide by the rules."

Another mixed message by an ineffective PM who nobody can trust
"The PM has been very seriously ill very recently. For that reason I think he should have had more time off. This thing is massive and needs someone with a clear head.re: foods being raided - we had sudden shutdown and as a local holiday camp was closed 5000 people were turned out into our rural area, queued an hour before the supermarket opened and cleared the shelves. Being rural we didn't get restocked for a fortnight. People came from hot spots to rent cabins or their second homes and again, stocked up. Motor homes came in droves away from the hot spots. They were sent home but first raided the supermarkets hearing their home stores were short.This was when the virus finally hit us through high street shops - first case,It's taken until the last week for out stores to restock and for our small population to feel secure in being able to isolate.People coming here to the countryside and seaside will want to eat. There are no cafes open.And yes, the toilets are closed to discourage unnecessary travel. Hopefully they will be opened."

I am listening right at this moment to the Prime Minister and his words are “ we THINK it is ADVISABLE to wear face coverings in some shops”
"The BBC said ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"".One could argue that supermarkets are ensuring that they are observing social distancing in them as they are operating on a one in, one out basis. Having heard Boris waffle in the Commons I am even surer that he is dumping the ""problem"" back onto us."
"Oh well, I bought a couple of face masks from Amazon last week, in anticipation, so will keep one in the pocket everytime I go to 'enclosed spaces' just in case it was required. But yes, the government makes it as they go along."
"Given this applies from Wednesday, I'll see what the general consensus is in Asda tomorrow. I've never seen an assistant in there wearing one. I still think they are pointless but if it saves tutting I'll concoct something out of a hankie and a couple of elastic bands."
I thought of making a couple so that I could bleach them between wearings but have things that are more fun to do.With people being able to drive to spots of beauty in England the ones that arrived for parties last weekend walked across the pavement and would not give way so in my case it may be more in open spaces!At the moment we can walk in the road due to lack of traffic but that will change.Concerned that our tiny police force and ambulance service may be overwhealmed if people do this + the virus + heart attacks and DIY accidents.
"I suggest our police force do what they are paid to do, investigate crimes and the recent guidelines only if they have nothing more important to do."
Can someone recommend a mask from Amazon? I've tried looking by they all either seem to have poor reviews or they're going to take months to arrive because they're coming from China! I've no idea what to get. Reusable would be my preference so I don't have to keep buying them.
"Just get anything you can get quick and is cheap, because on the long run it is a waste of money."
"It's not compulsory to wear a mask if you can avoid public transport and ""some"" shops( Whater they are).There was reference to a face covering rather than a mask as well.I am not convinced and will see what the situation is when I do the weekly supermarket shop.There were no store staff and only about 2 customers wearing masks when I went shopping last week in a large supermarket."
It's good to be ready just in case
I'm anticipating it becoming compulsory at some point.
When I went to Asda last week I saw several people with them.I'm finding searching immensely frustrating. Why is there no way of filtering Amazon search results so only UK based products cone up??
I got something off eBay in the end.
"Absolutely no way I'm paying a pound a pop on Amazon or anywhere else for disposable ones I'll use for 10 minutes then throw away. Or £4 for a couple of squares of cotton and some stitching. Extortionate profiteering that I won't be party to.If you don't have material or don't want to sew, then this is a good design using kitchen roll and a tissue, although we found it needed 2 elastic bands on each side.

"You know, I really am hoping for a quick end to this. I've had a large proportion of my life removed. I usually spend a lot of my time travelling up to London for museum and attraction visits (I'm a member of HRP, EH and the BM), and walks and cycle rides. I also frequently visit pubs for meals and some Real Ale. I had some bike rides planned that required train trips, and I was also supposed to be heading to Edinburgh (again) tomorrow. . Now all that has been taken away from me.I'm having to keep myself sane with local rides on bike, but I don't know for how long that will be enough......."
"""Face coverings can be removed for consuming food or beverages, but should be worn at other times.""Is there any guidance as to how to take them off, how to store them while you're eating, how to put them back on again? Because they only have any effect if a virus is actually present, whether from inside or outside, and once you start taking them off and putting them back on again the potential for contamination of other things must exist.Edited: 6:24 pm, May 11, 2020 "
"I would wear my Black face-bank-robbery mask, in the streets, on Public Transport, Buses, Underground, Overground (and possibly Wombling free.) However, were, I say, going from my home, in West London to the National Gallery, I would remove my mask, in the Gallery, for two or three hours whilst enjoying Paintings, eating and drinking.Cest la guerreAnthony KPS - Where possible I would be the one practising Social Distancing, cannot vouch for the others."

"#275. At least you're not dead. There's 32,000 people would have wished they could have been in your position."
"Bungle, according to the BBC Coronavirus Newscast, the Office of National Statistics should release the results of their antibody testing survey on Thursday. Although the antibody tests so far have not been deemed reliable enough to give individual assurance, they are good enough to get data from random sampling, which is what they have done. That should give some indication of how many people have had the virus, after allowing for the lag between having it and it showing up as antibodies. Since apparently the estimates for that range from 10% (not even the end of the beginning) to 50% (the beginning of the end), it could either fulfil or quash your hopes, but at least we should get a clearer understanding."
@275 You've had a large proportion of your life removed? ah poor you . You are still here unlike many who are not. What an idiotic statement.
Be Kind If somebody says that they are missing something it doesn’t mean that they are dismissing the suffering of others. Sometimes it helps just airing your frustration with strangers on a forum - let’s support each other
Absolutely shocking!!! And people have actually asked if we get to the park and there are other people there can we stay or should we leave?????? Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh what do you think?????? I have no words. Keep safe all. Lou x
"Obviously some people here have no understanding of how important mental health is, a bit like those who seem to think we should all be permanently locked up in our homes for months.@278 Let's get real here. You realise that 500,000 people die of one thing or another every year in England alone right?"
Agree Bungle!The experts have already mentioned there could be just as many Deaths because of the Lockdown.Mental Health - People are climbing the Walls!Anxiety - How do I pay the Bills? will I have a Job to go back to?Obesity - We are all eating more out of boredom and lack of exercise!Alcoholism - We are all drinking more!General Health - We may have conditions developing that we are putting on the back burner because we don’t want to get checked out or are scared to go to a Hospital!

"The government is encouraging people in England to start going out. First to work or a day out in the fresh air, then to spend money in the shops that will start to open. The ""stay home"" mindset needs to change to ""go out but take precautions"". This virus is going nowhere. It won't die out, there won't be a vaccine, certainly with the next 12 months. We have to adapt to it, minimise exposure if we're at high risk of death, but otherwise accept we may catch it. Or are you going to spend the next year too scared to go out? I'm in my 50s and overweight, so there is undoubtedly some risk for me. I may get a mild case, it may be more severe, I might die. Or I might win the lottery. Who knows? Life isn't a certainty. Adapt to your own level of risk, but don't stop living.Edited: 6:16 am, May 12, 2020 "

Can't disagree more with 287Coping wellNot eating or drinking more and going for daily walk and went to hospital appointment last weekPlanning to go out for a drive to a favourite spot of mine on edge of Cotswolds on Wednesday
"""Ask yourself a simple question? Are you happy with your life at the moment?""From a purely selfish point of view, I am certainly not unhappy. We don't have children or a mortgage, we have a flat with a balcony and large patio where we can sit outside on nice days and we have a large park five minutes walk away where we can easily keep our distance.I'm also an only child so am happy with my own company when Mrs Hornets is at work. Plenty to read and watch and I haven't even thought of subscribing to Netfiix.I've been working part time from home for a couple of years and with international tourism dead (and likely to remain so until at least 2022) and with no intention of forging a new career at 63, I have more than come to terms with retirement even though my state pension doesn't kick in for another couple of years.We will miss our American road trips and we are hoping that things will open enough for us to make one more farewell tour...if we can get insurance and there are airlines left by 2022...but if not then we will stay safe and enjoy what time we have left."

"“we will miss our American road trips”So you see Adam, it does have an affect on you!You also say you are not unhappy, but your not exactly jumping for joy.WarwickshireLad, was the Hospital appointment for a pre- Lockdown Condition? If so then fine, there is no doubt that people are turning a blind eye to symptoms they may have thought to seek medical attention for Pre-Lockdown, they are even running a TV Ad up here on the very subject where a Woman touches her Chest and says “och, it’s only a wee lump, I wouldn’t think of burdening the NHS just now”!And as Bungle says, no one knows how it affects each of us or at what state our health is in both physically and mentally."
"Re 299The Transport Minister has just announced a stimulus package for Cyclists, Walkers and Bus Lanes ... £200m+Nothing to aid the almost-walking wounded and nothing to stimulate the poor elderly. We'll keep badgeringAnthony K"
"£200 million for bus lanes but no one will be on them as we are told to avoid public transportEven in Wigan we have cycles lanes made at great expense but again, no one used them before the virus. There may be a video on you tube where some one filmed people playing crazy golf on them because they are always empty.Everyone has different circumstances and being furloughed or just having to stay at home may be ok if you have lots of indoor hobbies but take a football fan, unable to play or watch.Personally I have few hobbies except travel and researching, booking and preparing gives me something to look forward to"
"I'm more than happy with my life at present. OK Santana and Yes have been postponed so that means they should be performing again sometime. I get to cycle 20 miles to work in fresh air, I have even gone back to full time work because of this virus. My two weeks in Hawaii will be cancelled, but I will have earnt enough extra money to stay in better hotels and some helicopter rides over the islands.We have our first grandchild and get to see him regularly as his mother is a vulnerable person due to a c-section.Yes. Life is good for me"
I may not be jumping for joy but I am content and that is more than many (most?) people so I have a lot to be thankful for.
"My husband died last year and I thought I was adjusting well to living alone and was planning to start travelling solo this year. I am fortunate in not being in a vulnerable category by virtue of age or illness so I can volunteer for a local charity and I have a garden to look after which takes up some of my time. Being unable to see and touch my sons, grandchildren and friends is a major loss though so I’m not able to say I’m happy, I’m just about ok."

">>> At least you're not dead. There's 32,000 people would have wished they could have been in your position. <<<The actual increase in the death rate over the five-year average had reached around 50,000 by 1st May. . Having run slightly below the average for the first three months of the year, it rose dramatically at the end of March and in early April it was running at nearly 25,000 over the weekly average, normally around 12,000 at that time of year.Of those c.50,000 extra deaths, just over 36,000 had Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate. That still leaves an excess death rate of around 14,000 people who either died of Covid-19 without it being diagnosed, or who died as an indirect result of the crisis (e.g. not being treated for other illnesses, suicides). Covid-19 could well have claimed in excess of 100,000 extra lives, directly or indirectly, in the UK by the time this year ends. 100,000 of a population of over 66 million might not sound a lot, but it is nearly 20% more deaths than usual and given how widely the effects of each single death are felt throughout society, there will be few who escape the loss of a loved one, friend, work colleague, student, peer or acquaintance to the virus.Edited: 12:27 pm, May 12, 2020 "
">>> Having run slightly below the average for the first three months of the year, it rose dramatically at the end of March and in early April it was running at nearly 25,000 over the weekly average, normally around 12,000 at that time of year. <<<Sorry, I got that statistic wrong. It should have read:""Having run slightly below the average for the first three months of the year, it rose dramatically at the end of March and in early April it was running at nearly 25,000 a week, double the weekly average of around 12,000 at that time of year.""The other figures still stand though."
It's not statistically sound to compare a single year against an average and treat the results as absolute. There is no way to determine if this would have been above or below the average without C-19. The variation in years is too great.

"'Ask yourself a simple question? Are you happy with your life at the moment?' No.I am grateful that I have either avoided the virus or have had it (suspect the latter) and am still alive and that most family and friends have been unaffected. But my life is not at all what I wanted it to be right now for a number of reasons. That going outside - essential in my view - is limited and has an increased risk of meeting the virus does nothing for one's anxiety and is the cherry on a what's been a nasty cake.I'm willing to do what's necessary with the view of jam tomorrow but it's at a substantial cost, with no two people coping the same way with this tedious situation. As an aside, if anyone else has the urge to pull down signs in shops reading 'be kind' or 'keep smiling' and consign them to the nearest shredder, I'd help with the task."

AmosYes and Santana are no spring chickens so no guarantee that they will tour again in later years.I was taking Mrs A to see Diana Ross which has been cancelled and they want me to hang on to my tickets until a new date.Diana is about 75 so no guarantee we will ever see her over here again so I will be asking for a refund.
"""My husband died last year and I thought I was adjusting well to living alone and was planning to start travelling solo this year.""I'm in the same boat, I lost my wife of 46 years, six months ago to the day. I have no blood relatives in the UK, all my mates are in their 70s so will not be meeting up anytime soon. Both my wife and I loved to travel and I was planning on seeing more of the UK this year. Can't see that happening until next year. Yes I'm better off then some, I don't have any money worries and I don't work."
"I saw Santana at the BST two years ago, so not seeing them again isn't a big deal. I hadn't seen them for 40 years before that, so sure I can wait another 40.Boomtown Rats rescheduled for October and fortunately that missed Deep Purple by two days. Now I'm hoping Genesis have to reschedule and enough people can't see their new date and I manage to get tickets this time."
Santana is still playing Gm-C and Amaj7-Dmaj7 after 40 some odd years so you are not missing much.
Thought Santana used to be a vehicle assembler in SpainThey made Land Rovers at one time
I thought Santana was a key ingredient in fruit cakes?

"Per the OP, my prayer & hope is that common sense/smarts come into play. Most other FB posts are from those with time on hands and nothing to do. People with a lot of time on their hands , as travels comes to a send, stand still. My suggestion if someone(s) came to visit London in 2021, wanted to find a cheap hotel, wanted to know the best time of year to arrive, the best pubs, the best food, sights & museums to visit, places to purchase amazing crumpets, hotels to suggest across the city, taking taxi vs. the tube.Imagine your sister & husband or friends visiting with a toddler or teenager, what / where would you recommend they stay, they eat, they find a hotel?"
