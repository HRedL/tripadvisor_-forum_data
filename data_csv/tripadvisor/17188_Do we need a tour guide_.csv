"Hi! My husband, myself and our boys(5 and 7 years old) are heading to Cairo soon, and we want to see the pyramids(for a few hours)...do we need a tour guide/driver, or should we just take a taxi and look around ourselves? My husband has been to the pyramids once. We are hoping to ride horses or camels around the pyramids or sphinx...what do you think? Any information would be appreciated!!!Thanks!"
I would think that a lot of people on here would say yes...but it isn't compulsory! If you like doing your own thing and are prepared (taxi and a good guide book plus a little research)then no you don't need one. If you want the ease of someone taking you from place to place and organising your day then yes you need one!
Need a guide.. no .. But you'll get much (much) more out of the experience if you have guide. 
"I agree with the two members above. Having a guide and driver will make the day so much better, taxi drivers in Cairo can be terrible and I can speak Arabic and know the prices, but for you with I guess no arabic and having the childen with you too, why not go for some comfort.I like to be independant when I travel but really Cairo is a city of heavy traffic and it is getting hot. The taxi's will not be air conditioned. With a guide you will have a good vehicle and believe me, that makes all the difference.I just took my relative to the Pyramids - I hired a minibus with the help of a recommended guide and it was a great experience, we all loved the comfortable vehicle and the freindly and pleasant driver at our service for the whole day.So yes do it is style and comfort and you will have a much better day.You need to look at these pages :tripadvisor.com/Travel-g294201-c85398/Cairo:…tripadvisor.com/Travel-g294201-c84700/Cairo:…If you have some cool down time you can consider a visit to Al Azhar Park, my relatives just loved it.RegardsWendy"
"I would use a guide. Its a pre-arranged flat rate and then a little tip at the end, plus they look after you. My husband and i went with a guide and she explained so much about the sites which i am sure we would never have understood. She took photos for us too wish was fantastic. Then when we got conned for paying too much for a little souveneir ($5 USD) she gasped and took us back to the man whole sold us the item, had an argument with him and gave us ($4 USD) back. When we went to Egypt we had the intentions of ""roughing"" it. However, i wish we had gone the total opposite as it was too much of a culture shock for us to take in. So my tip is use a guide"
"I agree with everyone else about hiring a guide. We just returned from our trip in March and everything went so smoothly with a guide and driver! I wouldn't do it any other way! We rode the camels at the pyramids also and had a great time! If you are looking for a guide, ours was Mohamed Khairy Hassen and he was very knowledgeable and fun! You can contact me if you would like his contact info."
hi my wife and i went to cairo in jan 08. we did it ourselves we flew from luxor to cairo got a taxi from cairo airport to the pyramids. booked into le meridian hotel for one night did the pyramids that day and the light show that night. next day got a taxi from hotel to egyptian museum spent day there then taxi back to airport and flew back to luxor to our hotel.it was our second time to egypt so we sort of knew what to expect.if its your first time i would use a guide.do a deal with one and try to keep him all the time you are there.its an experience you will never forget.and we are going back to luxor again in jan next year for the third time in three years.egypt is amazing.
"Thank you so much for all of your advice...I am working on hiring a guide, thanks to your encouragement! I truly appreciate it!"

"We got back on friday we went to the pryamids in our first week, there is no way we would have attempted it on our own, just have to mention that we had EMad Aduhadeda and had a good time and found every thing good value and never to much trouble on our second day we had Mohammed and he was a lovely young man, very pleased "
