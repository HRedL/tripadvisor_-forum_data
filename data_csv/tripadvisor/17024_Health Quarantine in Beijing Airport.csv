Has anyone ever been quarantined at Beijing? If so can you please let me know what the process is. Thanks
This only occurs during an influenza epidemic. Also back during SARS.Don't worry about it.
"Thanks for the reply. I was actually thinking of what exactly happens if you have to declare one of the diseases listed on the form they give you when you arrive. Also, what would happen if you didn't declare it."
"Such as what?During the last round of flu quarantines, people who were overtly sick were taken to the hospital. If you had been seated on the airplane next to them, you were taken to a hotel, where you were kept under observation for about a week.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Why do you ask? There are serious reasons why those illnesses are listed for the general public health safety, why do you need to hide your illness? consequently putting everybody at great risk? What if people with Ebola hide their illness?"
"I understand that when you arrive in Beijing you have to go through a health and quarantine check before passport control. You need to fill in a form to confirm you don't have one of a list of diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis, leprosy, cholera etc. What happens if you tick one of those boxes and what happens if you don't declare it"
"Wrong question. It is your social responsibility to all people, all residents and all travelers to honestly declare your illness if it is listed. If you have one of those contagious illnesses, you should not travel to China or anywhere else, you are not welcomed anywhere."
I would not put anybody at risk but if the condition was a non infectious version would we be allowed entry even if it was on the list
That's like your tax declaration: If you don't tell them they will probably never know - but IF they find out trouble is big.
">>""I would not put anybody at risk but if the condition was a non infectious version would we be allowed entry even if it was on the list?""A ""non-infectious version"" of an infectious disease. Great! Please stay out of China. I have alerted the Beijing immigration authorities to be on the look out for you."
I am sorry but I cannot go into details but I can promise you this is not infectious.
I'm curious about the disease you're talking about that has infectious and noninfectious strains.
"It's really pretty easy to make an educated guess about what's going on here.For what it's worth, you may not even be asked to fill out a health form if your travel is soon. The last few times I've entered China (not Beijing) they have not been required."
This is not as suspicious as perhaps I am making it sound. I have a letter from a hospital confirming I am not infectious and am safe to travel and that I do not pose a risk. I am not sure what you mean by 'whats going on here' but I am sure you are wrong.There are some diseases which have infectious and non infectious strainsI say again I would not put anyone at risk
"To all the ones saying ""Stay away"": Do you know the medical record of everyone sitting next to you on the bus, train, airplane etc.? If someone knows about his/her disease and knows what to do to not infect others then what is the problem for him/her traveling the world? I'd rather have such a person next to me on the plane than someone NOT knowing about his/her condition and spreading it around."
For the benefit of everyone I have decided to complete the form honestly and declare the condition. I just wanted to know what the quarantine process was. We will only be in Beijing 48 hours
Thanks Jean P. When did you last go through Beijing?
jp I sent you a private message
