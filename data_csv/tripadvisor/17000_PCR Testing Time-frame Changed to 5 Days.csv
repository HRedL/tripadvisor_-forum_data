"This is from the Premier's Facebook page. I hope it helps some of you get there. Unfortunately Jetblue canceled ny flights, so I'm off to Aruba. • Agreed effective 22nd July 2020 for visitors and returning residents (with the exception of children aged ten (10) or under) to have evidence of a negative Covid-19 test taken within five (5) days of arrival in TCI instead of 72 hours. From 22nd July 2020, visitors and any person who is not covered under the National Health Insurance Plan must also have Covid-19 specific travel insurance that covers in country medical treatment, the cost of quarantine, and repatriation/medivac (if necessary)."
This is a more realistic timeframe . I have said that the policy to return to TCI will be ever changing . Stay tuned for more changes !
Five (5) days is much more reasonable.
"Here's the problem, you will not find any insurance company that will cover COVID-19, including cost of quarantine.Someone told me about Seven Corners, however, after reading the many negative reviews, it appears that this company is a SCAM.If T&C insists on this coverage, they need to step up and provide policies to be purchased from the island."
"Okay, this may seem like splitting hairs, but what if the test is taken 6 or 7 days before departure and the negative result is obtained within the five days? Would that satisfy the requirement?>>to have evidence of a negative Covid-19 test taken within five (5) days of arrival in TCI instead of 72 hours >>."
"<< ""this may seem like splitting hairs, what if the test is taken 6 or 7 days before departure"" >>Assuming they meant the words they wrote, it's petty clear...<< ""a negative Covid-19 test taken within five (5) days of arrival"" >>Neither 6 nor 7 days before departure are within 5.Edited: 1:08 pm, July 10, 2020 "
This is so helpful. Much more feasible now.
We would love to book we cannot get covid travel insurance. Hopefully this will change.
#3 Square Corner reviews...https:/…reviews
"#5My point was that the day the test is taken, it is neither negative nor positive, it is unknown until the result comes in."
Is this link somewhere that will carry the kind of needed insurance? Thansk.
"<< ""My point was that the day the test is taken, it is neither negative nor positive, it is unknown until the result comes in."" >>Ah... Schrödinger's test!If you studied physics (even at a non-Ivy league school) you would know that after the test is taken, but before the results are known, the test is BOTH positive and negative. The two are in superposition!:-)Unlike Schrödinger's cat, however, the fact that the TEST results are unknown doesn't change whether the PATIENT is actually positive or negative. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics notwithstanding, the wording is clear ""test taken within five (5) days of arrival"" so there's really no hairs to split.Edited: 2:11 pm, July 10, 2020 "
Worlds nomads
Has to be taken 5 days before departure so if you leave on a Saturday have to take it Tuesday
Not even a Schrodinger's cat hair? :-)My dilemma is we are scheduled to arrive on a Monday. Would you try to push that back to a Friday in case labs aren't working on weekends?
"Sorry for this being a tad bit off-topic, but #11/#15 it's a good day when you can squeeze in a Shrodinger's cat reference......nicely done."
"<< ""Would you try to push that back to a Friday in case labs aren't working on weekends?"" >>I wouldn't be travelling under these considerations.:-)"
"I don't want to be everyone's rain cloud, but while you're all celebrating the shift from 3 days to 5 days (k.i.m: you can be infected at anytime during that period), and the fact that someone ""might"" sell you a TCI qualifying insurance plan, has anyone considered what would happen if someone were actually sick enough to ""need"" evacuation?My understanding is that suspected/positive cases will be quarantined on the island. Statistically, if there is an appreciable number of visitors, chances are that one or more of those quarantined will be sick enough to need medical treatment. Where will you get that treatment? I imagine US Citizens expect to get that treatment in the US, BUT there is precedent for this Administration refusing to allow, or delaying, COVID-19 positive Americans' re-entry to the US.This is a bad idea for the TCI and for travelers. Have you seen the spike in cases on Caribbean islands that have opened to tourists? Press Release from Virgin Islands Governor discussing the spike and closing beaches at 4PM on weekends and holidays, among other restrictions (to try to stop the spread), is below:https://doh.vi.gov/news/governor-bryan-tight…Also, look at the spike in cases in the TCI since they have repatriated. Some cases are discussed in this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14739…The safest thing to do right now is Stay home, wash your hands, mask up and act responsibly.Stay and travel safe!"
@ DagnyNY once you arrive on the island there is no one who is going to force you to be tested again and even more so there is no need to get tested to board your flight back home so I am no understanding your argument
"<< ""there is CURRENTLY no need to get tested to board your flight back home "" >>Fixed it for you.:-)"
Schrödinger's cat walked into a bar and didn't?Sorry folks but I have to agree with Dagny on this one. I fear opening on 22 July may not work out well. I get it has to happen sometime but watching the nightmare unfold on the news tonight about Florida etc. makes one pause. While the TCI did get some ventilators/ICU beds (6?) and imported medical staff from Cuba to run them there may be a huge increase in Covid patients at the Hospitals. I get the whole logistics of a PCR test but 5 days post test is a ton of time to acquire Covid. I hope that contact tracing is in place and any (perhaps inevitable) increase in Covid cases can be well controlled and isolated. Also keep in mind most people that go on to ventilators never leave the hospital alive. The best defense is limit the spread. At least until we have an effective vaccine or therapeutics. I would love to have business come back to the TCI but not at the cost of loosing friends.
"I am new but i know I have put off my travels until 2021. it was reported today in the US that a domestic Delta flight carried 3 passengers on July 6 that were shoeing no symptoms and on the net day July 7 Covid-19 flared up in them. This may not be immediately relevant, but it has to scare some of the governments. Furthering the possibility of seemingly healthy passengers bringing the virus.Three people have tested positive for coronavirus on Friday after taking a Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Albany, New York.Flight 4815 left on July 6, a release from the Rensselaer County Health Department said.The passengers were not symptomatic on the flight, but began showing symptoms on July 7.Delta is in contact with regional CDC officials and has provided a manifest of the flight, Black said."

"I took a repatriation flight from Chicago to London in May. Stuck in USA when on holiday. Here are my observations from the experience:Dont assume that the TSA will follow procedures - they did not, so be watchful. I took a large tub of Chlorox with me and it was allowed through. Clean down everything that the TSA touched as soon as you go through. Neurotic? No, there is a high incidence of TSA employees catching the virus and sadly many have died. They are now told to wear a different pair of gloves for each passenger. I am putting everything I can into hold luggage. Only thing on board will be laptop bag will be computer stuff, meds etc.Dont assume that airport staff will have mask on. Wear your own mask from when leaving home (yes) until you enter your accommodation. Dont touch it. Take 2 masks with you and when 1 is used put it into a plastic bag and seal it.The airline filled the plane from the back forwards. Worthwhile paying for a window seat nearer to the front - you may get bumped up.On the plane, I felt safe as there are HEPA filters etc. Cabin crew wearing masks. Declined all food. Dont take food with you from home as the TSA will check it even when in a see through container. More contamination. Just take any bottles of water given out and wipe them down especially the caps before handling.Avoid communicating with anyone. Just keep the mask on. When going to the toilet, wait for when the line is short or not there. Take the Chlorox wipes with you. Use sanitizer when you get back to your seat for hands. The toilets are the biggest risk with airborne droplets and touch points.On arrival, your passport is the touch point. Keep this all throughout the journey in a sealed plastic bag. When at your accommodation, wipe it clean - cover and all pages. And relax!Edited: 8:34 am, July 11, 2020 "
"I am starting to think your way. I know you can get your results right away. But my sister and brother-in-law are 9 days and counting. And they have talked to other people in Oakland County and it is taking 7-10 days. I don’t think it worth the possible exposure. I wasn’t going till September, thinking this might calm down. I am just up in the air to give it a try. Plus most important I am an immune compromised person. I already moved the trip a month. Maybe it is just best to wait a year."
Grace Bay Club sent an email with the updated requirements and one of their recommendations was the at-home nasal swab test that you send off to Lab Corp. I verified that it was the PCR test. Anyone thinking of going that route?
JetBlue Canceled NY flights? I didn't hear this. They never contacted me. Did they cancel all of the flights?
Only for July . August 1 on is a go from JFK

Yes saw that on GBC website as well and ordered it.
"I'd be careful ordering a home test thinking that you .willget results back in 1 to 2 days. I looked at the labs website and this is the updated infoOur COVID-19 kits provide everything you need to collect a nasal swab sample and send it back to our lab. Kits are available to all individuals who meet the screening criteria for COVID-19 testing. 7/9 update: With significant increases in COVID-19 testing demand, the average time to deliver results may now be 4-6 days from when your sample is received at the lab"
"Dr. Jim, I never thought of that but really a great point to be considered."
"Between shortage of tests, time it takes to get results. Covid hot zones Atlanta GA & Florida to Hubs that airlines go thru. I have decided to postpone to November. I am getting same rate at Ocean Club West. They are actually trying the home test and seeing how long it takes to get results back. I was going to go to Florida in November, I just decided to cancel that and see what happens next 4 months.I use Allianz Insurance which is offered when you book air flights and it seems to me that they cover what is asked. Or another name is World Nomads which Ocean Club checked into. I know Jet Blue for sure cancelled flights to TCI in July and I think Delta did too. It seems like when the Premier announced that they were not moving forward with the next phase, the airlines seem to put a hold on Flights until the beginning of August. I can only speak for Delta and JetBlue."
"#38I have the Allianz policy that I bought when I bought the air, and it specifically excludes ""Epidemics"" which I'm pretty sure a Pandemic is inclusive of an epidemic. So, no, the Allianz insurance, by my read, is not Covid specific."
"I just called Allianz and they have a disclaimer that if you get sick with Covid-19 you have Trip Cancellation for that and if you get sick with Covid while you are away $20,000 Medical coverage and $30,000 emergency transportation."
Everyone: Why travel? There are plenty of issues. Sit tight and wait. Geez.
"Dr. Jim: Can you find out if Canadians would be covered, given the travel advisory in force in Canada, all non-essential travel is strictly at your own risk. When you return, you must quarantine for 14 days.If you could let me know, much appreciated."
"Mel, I don’t see anyway around getting insurance as long as we have the non essential travel ban ( rightfully so) . I’ve done a ton of research and not been able to find an insurance that will cover properly."
TC is reinstating the curfew as a result of increase in covid cases.
"West ford—thru July20, so before international opening"
"With hopeful news about potential vacinnes, would having a vacination just before having the PCR test show a false positive I wonder? Dr Jim or other medic view available?"
"Just curious, for the people planning on going in july or August what testing facilities do you plan or using ? It seems like with all the people getting tested that the 5 day time frame is leaves no room for error. If you arrive on a Saturday then monday test and pray you can get it back with enough time to upload everything and approved prior to getting to the airport the morning of.If you are arriving mid week its worse because the labs are closed Saturday and Sunday. What's your game plan?"
"I have no game plan. Cannot go. Too risky trying to get results in 5 days and in Canada we cannot get travel insurance that covers covid. If anyone in Ontario finds coverage, please let us know."
"Just wondering, is there a Rapid PCR test available for COVID 19?I called a clinic and was told if its for travel you just have to pay out of pocket the $135.00 and they offer the rapid PCR COVID test (same day results). My husband and i have plans for 8/15/20 through 8/22/20 and i'm concerned about time as well. Thanks"
We do not have the option to go to a private clinic for testing. All testing done in Ontario is through the government.
"Yes, testing is government controlled in every province I think. We, here in N.S. can’t get tested unless showing Covid signs. I have no issue with that and know it will delay any future travel plans. I will explore my beautiful province this month comfortably know that our borders are closed to the US."
"When I booked my flight yesterday via phone call with jet blue vacations, they told me specifically that the Allianz option does not cover Covid"
TCI requirement is for a RT-PCR test. Travelex insurance may work for you
#51. Sorry hit enter too soon. The TCI Assure program will only accept a covid test that says RT-PCR on your document. Most rapid tests do not meet this.Ask you testing facility specifically for a RT-PCR test. You may have to go beyond the gate keeper/phone operator to find out.
Does the insurance have to cover covid or just include hospitalization and med evac?
"#57 must cover medevac https:/…tci-assuredTravelex insurance seems to be acceptable.Edited: 2:32 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"#57 lesdixia, sorry.Insurance must cover Covid and medvac ""Medical/travel insurance that covers medevac, any costs related to quarantine, ambulance care or care at the local hospital."" or you could look at it that if you have insurance that won't cover medvac or hospital due to Covid19 they won't accept it."
#59: Love it. A learning curve. Not easy to travel which you have found out from other potential travelers.To answer the OP: Everyone answered for you and I think you know what to do/ not to do. Enjoy your summer. No reason to be on this forum.
"""No reason to be on this forum."" exactly so. at least I answered three relevant questions with accurate info, You? People need to know. The Fires Just read all reviews.All there to see. Just look a the map. No reason to go. Feel bad for you. Really. Already posted on several forums. No one is traveling given all the restrictions. It is what it is. Why opine.? Unless anyone on this forum is a great doctor who can cure, dis cure cancer or diabetes. This is devastating to all. Many countries are involved."
"Hi. I am hoping you can help clarify the 5 day window. Does it include the day you land? For example, if we arrive Saturday, is Monday a day too soon to test? I have tried to contact the TCI officials, but they are down due to the storm. I really appreciate your help."
"eastfam, if you’re arriving on Saturday, then Monday is your test day.If you go to the TCI tourist board FB page, they have a great chart on it to help you."
"#62Hi there. I asked the same question. So if you arrive at 1:30 PM on a Saturday, then you would have had to have had your test no earlier than 1:31 PM on Monday. Hope this helps."
"Lisa M, good information, that is a little tidbit of information they neglected to mention. That chart has caused many problems from the get go. Hope things have worked themselves out. I know quite a few people who have either been denied or had to actually change the date of heir flight because of that chart."
"TCI has revised this week so that your travel date doesn’t count. So no need to worry about time of day you get tested vs arrival times.“Please be advised that the policy has now been revised, travel day is no longer counts towards the 5 day period”."
"5 days is 120 hours, that will be how i proceed. I have talked to people denied when over the 120 hours. Take it for what is is worth."
"it is absolutely NOT hours. It's days. They publicly clarified it. There was tons of debate on this weeks ago, and they had to make it clear. monday for saturday, tuesday for sunday, .... here's the link - scroll down to July 28th. 10:47AM. That should make it perfectly clear. https://www.facebook.com/pressofficetcig/"
"Stevie, yes 5 days is 120 hours no matter how you slice it. Everyone feel free to interpret 5 days any how you wish. Knowing people who were turned down(yes recently) who went by the chart but were turned down because they were technically over 5 days not within 5 days. I am just putting this out there, pretty easy. If you land at 3 take your test at 3. Personally not taking any chances. Now we have people who are going on 7-8 days out because of the storm, certainly no fault of anyone's."
"Thank you, TewksNC. Five days = 120 hours. I don't understand how anyone can dispute that. https:/…regulations**upload approved documentary evidence of a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR COVID-19) test from an accredited laboratory, as provided in regulation 5 undertaken no more than five days prior to travel to the Islands; andupload proof of health or travel insurance cover, as provided in regulation 6; andobtain a TCI Assured Travel Authorisation"
P.S. - I am going to go with the posted TCI .gov regulations over a Facebook post.
"Yes, I took rapid PCR test and TCI accepted it. Received my travel authorization today. Make sure you read all their requirements regarding information report must contain - type of specimen collected, date collected, etc."
Too much trouble. Can wait until 2021.
