As reported by the Secretaria de Salud de Quintana Roo at noon today:https://m.facebook.com/SESAQROO/
"Thanks, Joan. The good news is that two cases are now recuperated."
"From everything I've heard and read we should be at or very near the peak in the next couple of days. Hopefully we'll see a decline in cases after that. IAnd yes, excellent news that 2 are in recovery and no deaths. If Isla can get through this with a 0 death count then all in all I think the island and the people will have been very lucky."
I read earlier that 1 person did die from the virus.
That was supposedly incorrect info on FB.
The Secretaria de Salud Quintana Roo reported 0 deaths from the virus on Isla in the last figured I saw yesterday.
Just checked today's stats.Isla Mujeres is now up to 10 cases. So 3 new cases in 24 hours. Still reporting 0 deaths.
"thanks Joan. For one, I really appreciate your posts and Mr. B's.BP"
"As always good , on the scene, information from Joan. To me, always preferable to just cut and pasting articles , etc. Always nice to hear the personal point of view. But many others on the site are also helpful."
"I am just reading that on Saturday, 3 new cases were reported on the island. the three cases in one day, It is reported authorities have increased the police and traffic surveillance measures.It is hoped this is a one day event and soon things will return to normal."
My heart goes out to the people and families on Isla and everywhere who are battling this virus. Thank you for keeping us informed.
Another new case was reported today bringing the total to 11. 4 cases are reported as recuperated. Still 0 deaths thank goodness.
"Joan, is anyone is hospital or are they all home recovering?"
I don't know. Perhaps Islawoman has that info. She has excellent sources for all the local info. E gets updates daily for this area since he works for the City but they only give overall stats for Isla. The only hospitalization stats are for Benito Juarez as a whole.
"Sorry, but I don't know. Hopefully not."
Anyone know what their testing regime is ? Are they only testing those with symptoms or is it more widespread than that ?
"I'm sorry to say that while the Secretaria de Salud de Quintana Roo reported no new cases on Isla in the past 24 hours, they are reporting the first virus related death on the island."
"Oh, that is too bad :("
"Sadly a death was reported today, no details given to protect the family's privacy. 11 cases total. Praying for the health and safety of Isla."
I have been informed by my local friends on the island that there are 10 cases. That was 2 days ago so that number may have increased.
Don't listen to friends. Official data on these websites...https:/…nuevo-coronavirus-covid-19https://www.facebook.com/SESAQROO/
"Well without more information I’m not sure how we can trust government websites. We need to know how many people have been tested or the numbers are meaningless. The majority of cases are asymptomatic so it’s unlikely that they would be tested. The more people you test, the more cases you will discover. Also, the tests they are most likely using won’t show the number of people who have been infected but recovered on their own. In our jurisdiction they are only testing people with symptoms so asymptomatic infections aren’t being counted. I’m pretty sure my wife and I had the virus in mid January but did not meet the criteria for testing so we will never know unless we get antibody testing. Stay safe everybody."
"It’s going to be a long summer.https:/…Edited: 6:27 am, May 14, 2020 "
Today's stats released by the Secretaria de Salud de Quintana Roo show one more positive case for a total of 12. There are 4 listed as recuperated and I know that one of the active cases is a child under 4 who had to be hospitalized. Still only 1 death.
Regarding the post about testing. From what I am hearing there is very little testing/tracing ON the Island. Those that have been tested go to Cancun.
"Today's statistics show another positive case brings the total to 13. 4 showing as recuperate and, thankfulky, still only one death."
"""Anyone know what their testing regime is ? Are they only testing those with symptoms or is it more widespread than that ?""Like all of Mexico only those showing symptoms are being tested."
Joan...that’s the same up here. I just don’t get how they give out numbers like ‘how many infected’ when it’s thought that the majority of cases are asymptomatic. There must be far more infected people walking around than we think and they don’t even know they have it.
Holding at 13 cases but they are reporting one more person as recuperated. So good news there.
Walker E - So that almost tells us all how much it has been overblown right? If its just a matter of testing people to prove positive but with no symptoms...
2 more people listed as recuperated for a total of 7. Number of cases holding at 13. So good news there!
"That is good news, Joan!"
Another new case reported today for a total of 14. Still 7 recovered and sadly the one death.
"The test is flaky, and a positive could well be a FALSE positive. This is an eye-opening article:https:/…should-you-get-tested-covid-19If they tested 100 perfectly healthy people, 14 false positives wouldn't surprise me at all."
No new cases reported (yeah) and 2 more reported as recovered (big yeah).It's going in the right direction
Thanks again for the update!! It's much appreciated.
You're more than welcome. I only wish I could report the same about Cancun as far as cases holding steady with no new deaths.We're not that lucky.
"Unfortunately, there were 3 new cases reported yesterday. Still holding steady at 9 recovered and 1 death."
2 more cases reported for a total one 19.One more case classified as recovered.
"Granted, 19 cases doesn't sound like that many, but then perhaps for a small island it is. Still, since there are increases is the June 8 reopening for hotels still in plan?"
"TravelerNewYork, As far as the state is concerned, yes. But it's also up to the local government. Municipalities can increase restrictions from what the government sets and maintain closures of they are fit. But they can't lessen them. So to be a go the local government has to give it's okay too."
"Thanks, Joan. Makes sense."
No new cases and one more listed as recovered. Yeah!!
Great update! Thanks Joan!
Great news!
"That is great news and keeping Isla in my heart and prayers! A special shout out to Joan, Isla Women and Robert for their unbiased inside scoop, very much appreciated.  For those affected, Privilege Aluxes is closed now until 7/24/20, changed from the 6/25 original re-open date. A lot of people ask, what do you miss most with the quarantine. I think hugging and seeing my loved ones, eating dinner in a restaurant and Isla might be my top 3! ❤️Stay safe everyone, everywhere!"
"I am not Joan. I am her better half, E. She's busy but I know she posts the new information daily. I must report the island has another positive case reported. No change in death or recuperations. Joan will be back mañana but I am happy to substitute for her. I am sorry the news is not better. One new case more is to much.Please excuse my bad english."
What bad English? It’s perfect. And thank you for update.
"Thanks for posting that, E! Looking forward to seeing you and Joan when all this is over."
Sadly 2 new cases reported. Two more listed as recuperate so at least that's good.
Unfortunately new cases seem inevitable pretty much everywhere. But it's good to hear of the recoveries.
One more recuperated.
"The daily report indicates only three active cases, and none in hospital.Edited: 1:31 pm, June 13, 2020 "
Daily reports here: https:/…nuevo-coronavirus-covid-19
Another new case reported in the past 24 hours.
One more positive case on Isla but still none of the currently affected are requiring hospitalization.
Another new case but still none that require hospitalization.
3 new cases in the past 24 hours and 2 more listed as recovered. But no hospitalization which is good nrws.
"I heard the owner of Picus Don Héctor Gil is in the hospital with it. Maybe he is a Cancun resident?While I've never met him, he seems to be a very nice a popular guy. Picus was taking care of its employees and helping feeding locals. They are doing some fundraising to help get him transferred to a different treatment center."
"Secretaría de Salud Quintana Roo on Facebook has added the number of active cases to the statistical data.As of 12:00 noon today, Isla Mujeres has 4 active cases.The entire state of QR has 675 actives cases.https://www.facebook.com/SESAQROO/"
"Those numbers don't add up. If there were 30 positive cases and currently there are 4 active, 19 recuperated, and 2 deaths, what happened to the other 5?Somewhere the Secretaria de Salud seems to be missing 5 cases in the stats."
"I think there are also cases under study ('casos en estudio""), or tests not yet confirmed as positive or negative.Edited: 5:30 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Yeah, I get that. But they say 30 positive, not 30 positive or under study. Still seems like their stats don't add up. Could be a number of reasons but you'd think they'd go to great pains to get it as well as make a distinction between positive and under study. They are two very different things. But then again, we are talking about a government agency, lol."
"Since none of them add up, there's obviously a category that isn't being shown. I don't think they'd get their math wrong."
I didn't mean they'd get their math wrong. I'm sure accuracy of their numbers is the number one concern. This is especially true since we face the very real possibility of going back to red. I agree that likely there's some info missing somewhere. And it is the first day of the new format. I'm sure will see a new category of something in the next day or two. What really matters is that they know the true numbers and I'm sure they do. Those numbers will determine whether we stay orange or go back to red. I don't think think there's a snowball's chance in hell of going to yellow.
2 more positive tests in the past 24 hours. Still none requiring hospitalization.
"Is that 32 now and rising? ""I heard the owner of Picus Don Héctor Gil is in the hospital with it. Maybe he is a Cancun resident? "" Is he a Isla resident?"
">> ""Is that 32 now and rising? ""There have been a total of 32 positive cases since whenever the count began back in February or March, but there have been 19 recoveries and 2 deaths which by my calculation leaves a total of 11 active cases.And the number is increasing.Edited: 9:40 am, July 03, 2020 "
"In the very near future the stats will also include info about how the active cases are broken down by region, colonias and supermanzanas. So we'll be able to see exactly what parts of each city (or island) are the most affected by active cases. And remember, the stats for Isla Mujeres include mainland Isla Mujeres as well. So not all active reported cases are necessarily on the island."
One more listed as recuperated but 2 more positive tests.
"5 more positive cases. Still no hospitalizations. I just wish the number of positive cases wasn't going up as quickly as it is. And remember, these numbers include mainland Isla Mujeres. The Secretaria de Salud does not distinguish between the island and the mainland."
"And in case anyone is interested in the breakdown of where the active cases are on Isla, click on this link:https://geoportal.qroo.gob.mxJust click on Cancun then you'll also see Isla Mujeres. You can just touch a neighborhood and it will tell you how many active cases there are in that area. My area in Cancun has 1."
Three more new cases reported and sadly another death. Still no hospitalizations.The death happened a few days ago. I'm just haven't looked at all the reports E gets for a few days.
One more positive case reported in today's stats.
4 more positive cases reported. Recuperate cases are going up as well but not at the same rate as the positive cases. Still none requiring hospitalization per the reported figures.
We've been trying to stay on top of whether a return to tourism will result in an uptick in cases and a possible return to more of a red condition. We're reaching a point when we need to decide about our September trip.
"All along, we've had a backup plan of driving to Boston to see my son. We've never been to Cape Cod and he's promised to take us."
"Dmartin, glad you have a backup plan to at least getaway.We just cancelled my daughters wedding in Puerto Rico next week as their restrictions were just too tight and their cases are on the rise. For now, we've moved it to November (which we realize is still questionable) but in the meantime I am now in a mad rush to plan a small family ceremony at home that makes the happy couple feel as special as they are! Then we will party and celebrate when Puerto Rico reopens safely.Edited: 1:29 pm, July 17, 2020 "
We just cancelled 30 days in sept planned for a 30th anniversary. Don’t feel comfortable going this year. Bummin : (
"3 more new cases reported today. Agan, still none that currently require hospitalization. In the past month there have been 33 new cases compared to the 24 cases that were reported during the time time island was shut down to outsiders."
Another 3 positive cases reported. Recuperated cases stand at 28 and still none requiring hospitalization. No new deaths thankfully so still standing at 3.
"Sadly, there are 3 additional positive cases reported today. And, unfortunately, 1 more death."
"""In the past month there have been 33 new cases compared to the 24 cases that were reported during the time time island was shut down to outsiders.""It was probably this post that ultimately made us decide to cancel our September trip. We were comfortable taking measures to protect ourselves but couldn't bear the idea of contributing to this increase."
Do you have a new month you're shooting for?
"DMartin, Well geez, now I feel bad. I didn't intend to throw a monkey wrench into your plans but do feel it's important that people have all the info, good and bad, when deciding whether or not to visit."
We have to ask ourselves. Would it be safer to never travel again?
"""We have to ask ourselves. Would it be safer to never travel again?""While it might very well be safer not to travel anymore, for me that's just not an option. I love to travel. And while it might sound silly to some, my life would have a huge void it in if I knew I wasn't going to travel again. I already have two big trips that I need to reschedule when the time is right. But, I will look at traveling differently now. Things that I never thought of when planning a trip now will be put into the equation. I think travel and it's importance in your life is a very personal thing. Even if I know it comes with risk I will continue to travel. Of course, I'll take precautions that hopefully will mitigate some of those risks. Nothing we do in our lives is 100% without risk. Whether or not you want to assume those risks depends on how important the activity is to you. Travel is one of things in my life that I value greatly. I'll make sure I'm well informed of the risk and do my part not to become a a risk to others, but I will continue to travel. I"
“Would it be safer to never travel again?“Certainly not never. Just not now.
"Like Joan, not traveling is not an option for me, nor should it be an option for anyone, in my opinion. It's too important. Travel is not just a way to enjoy one's time off from work, it's a way of seeing and understanding the world we live in. It helps shape who we are. As Mark Twain said, ""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.” Travel colors the way we live our lives. Terry Pratchett wrote, ""Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.""A few years ago, I had the chance to bring my parents to Isla Mujeres. We ate dinner one night at one of the coctelerias, toes in the sand, watching the sky catch fire as the sun sank. I remember telling my parents that of all the gifts they gave me, the greatest was instilling a love of travel in me at an early age. I cannot imagine how colorless my life would have been without travel. As St. Augustine said, ""The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.""Certainly one needs to take precautions, but I urge everyone to travel as often as possible. Imagine how much better the world could be if everyone took the time to explore other cultures, to see the world through other eyes and to befriend those whose lives are very different from our own. As Mrs. Gibbs says in Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town,"" ""It seems to me that once in your life before you die you ought to see a country where they don’t talk in English and don’t even want to."""

"@94 That’s an overly rosy picture...I am sure Mark Twain and St Augustin weren’t talking about spending a week at a gigantic all inclusive hotel sipping margarita on the beach while surrounded with speakers playing loud music and eating all you can...as is the case of many. In those times, the simple traveler observed and adapted to the local environment; today, in locations that receive a lot of visitors, it is the local environment that transforms to adapt to the tourist.There’s over 8b people on the planet... While tourism has a lot of beneficial effects, mass tourism can also have effects very opposite to those you mention, affecting the local way of life, culture, environment and resources (such as water), even creating resentment among the local population. For example, there is the use of enormous pieces of real estate to construct huge generic resorts accessible only to tourists pushing away local populations and destroying cultural and natural environments while the prices of food, land, housing, infrastructures and local attractions increase. Chain stores, restos and cafes pop everywhere. The local economy loses variety and becomes almost entirely dependent on tourism. The needs and interests of a tourist can be pretty different than those of a local. Jobs are important but they are not all. We went back to Riviera Maya 2 years ago after not visiting for 10 years and found that development had gone out of control in the region. New constructions also tend to be bigger than ever with little local flavour and charm. We do not think that we will ever return.In any event, limiting travel and postponing trips temporarily due to the pandemic is not a bad idea.Edited: 10:38 am, July 23, 2020 "

"DMartin216, Thanks so much for the Twain. It made my COVID-weary day."
@DMartin- beautifully said.
"kollision.....have you been back to the town you grew up in? (I know it's supposed to be ""the town in which you grew up"" but I think that sounds hoity toity.) Anyway.....change is everywhere. I don't even recognize my home town."
"Is truly bad this virus, I was skeptic that is not as bad as news tells until recently, guy that works Sunny Days Cancun transportation got sick, lack of oxygen, fingers got blue, 4 AM made to hospital, now 2 days on vent. Stay home people!! For your health and others, Stop the spread of covid!!!"
"I think DMartin hit the nail on the head with his post. Without travel it's impossible to truly understand the world we live in. You don't get a true feeling of how a community is by reading about it or looking at photos in a book. You only really understand a community and it's people by going their and experiencing life there.Anthony Bourdain once said "" Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life-and travel-leaves marks on you. Travel isn't always pretty. It isn't always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts. But that's okay. The journey changes you; it should change tou. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and in your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something behind. ""That's always been how I feel about travel. It's just not something I could or want to give up. I want my world to be big. Not small. And without travel I fear the world would feel very small. At least to me."
"Juan, is NOT the right time to travel, and you DO know it, Cancun affected badly with COVID but because people who live there needs tourist they do not care of others.

One more positive case reported today and 5 more reported as recovered.
"The positive case was someone many of you know: my good friend, Dr. Greta Shorey. She had an elevated temperature on July 15 so is nine days into the course of the disease and although she feels she is coming out of it now, it was rough. Her first antibody test on July 17 was negative but she retested on July 22, this last Wednesday and it was positive. (She has posted this on Facebook so I am not betraying any confidence.) She had been treating a number of patients who were very sick with Covid-19 and said her getting infected was inevitable. I had contact with her on July 7, July 11 and July 15 but am fine so far. Let’s all send our best healing vibes out to Greta, who is truly an angel who walks among us.Edited: 6:16 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"Good vibes have been heading her way since you told me. I plan on keeping them up for her.She, like many medical professionals, have put her health behind taking care of others. When she gets to Heaven (a long long time from now) there will be a seat reserved just for her. She has my gratitude for all she's done. She should have everyone's."
She has mine. All the best to her and everyone.
"This is what she wrote about it. It shows her shining nature.""And how each new day, as we learn more, we realise how little we know.But in general I am very pleased to have had it, and ,though will be using all the same precautions, i do feel I am better able to help patients."""
Four new cases reported in the past 24 hours as well as three more reported as recovered.
You're making us feel better about our decision to cancel. I'm sure it's not necessarily tourists bringing COVID to the island so much as the greater interaction required to resume tourism activities. That's why we felt we'd be partly responsible for new cases.
"The Mayor of IM reported that he has tested positive for Covid-19...Original report: https://www.poresto.net/quintana-roo/2020/7/…Translation: https://translate.google.com/translate…Edited: 6:35 pm, July 26, 2020 "
3 more positive cases reported.
One more new case reported and three more reported as recovered.
"A tourist from Britain arrived in Cancun two weeks ago. On July 25 he started showing symptoms of Covid-19. He tested positive and was admitted to a private clinic. He died yesterday. Since the incubation period for the virus is 2-14 days, he might have brought it with him or he might have picked it up at his resort.

I've lost count. How many active cases does Isla have? Thanks Joan.
"TravelerNewYork,I don't have the data in front of me but I believe there are currently 37 active cases on Isla as of noon today."
Thank you!
One new case reported today.
No new cases reported and three more recuperated. Good news today!!
"The stats reported today aren't good. No new recouperations. 8 new positive cases.And, sadly, 1 more death."
3 more new cases reported today. No change in number of recuperate cases or deaths.
"3 new cases reported for a total of 101 positive cases. Still 6 deaths and 51 reported as recovered. So, currently 44 active cases on Isla. All in the island; none are on the mainland."
"but how do they know those numbers while there are no mass tests, only those who already with heavy symptoms are counted?"
These numbers obviously represent the number of positive cases out of the people who have been tested. I think everyone here is intelligent enough to realize that there are likely more cases because not everyone gets tested if they show symptoms for various reasons But these numbers are helpful in that they show positive cases are on the rise. Are they perfect numbers? No. But they are what we have to deal with. Being supercritical does nothing helpful. Would you rather not know about the 101 positive cases just because the numbers aren't inclusive of all the cases on Isla diagnosed or not?
"u got me wrong, no I am not supercritical , I just wanted to make sure people understand that situation is not great because its just 1 or 2 , but is more out here .. is actually very helpful that you remind people every other day that covid did not go anywhere, its still as dangerous as is, they should do precautions"
8 more listed as recovered today. No changes otherwise.
"Today's released stats are not good. 11 new cases, 1 more recovered and sadly 1 new death. That makes total cases 112, 7 deaths and 60 recoveries. So, currently, there are 45 active cases on the island."
1 more new case and 3 more recuperated per today's stats.

"Here's some additional info E shared with me in case anyone's interested. Some people like stats. Isla Mujeres has the 4th worst Incidence Rate in the State at 9.23 people per 10,000 inhabitants. Holbox has the worst at 18.35 followed by the Chetumal area (Orthon P Blanco) and Bacalar (14.06). The best rate in the State is is the Cancun-Puerto Morelos area with 3.28 followed by Solidaridad (Playa Del Carmen) at 4.48. Cozumel is at 5.09 and Tulum is at 7.95"

I am liking the trends going down. This is happening nationally and also in the state I live in. However I have not made the final decision on our trip to IM yet. We still have 3 weeks to decide. Think I will wait for your trip report also Joan. I know you posted it somewhere but can't remember. When were you going?
"Rangmx, Two trips actually before you arrive. This weekend the 22nd of August for just one night. Then again on August 31 for 9 nights."
Today's stats show 6 new cases and 1 more listed as recovered. 49 active cases on the island.

Today’s...?
"Sorry, apparently Post a Reply went a bit loco on me, lol.Two new cases and one more death reported today. No new recoveries."
Doesn't seem to be getting much better. I hope IM at least stays Orange for as long as possible. Once they go to Yellow its going to be a mess.
Another 2 new cases reported today.
"Joan, is that 58 active cases or less the recovered ones?"
"TNY, Currently there are 51 active cases on the island. And there are 76 cases listed as recovered. And, sadly, 9 deaths."
