"Hi guys, Has anyone had problems with a refund from Loveholidays.com & if so or in general,how long did it take? We are well before the ""within 28days"" cut off for free cancellation for our hotel booking and we paid it in full at time of booking 4mths ago. But we are thinking of cancelling now and have sent cpl emails and heard nothing back and tried to call and was surprised to find I couldn't speak to anyone after 5pm. (Yet you can book of course, until 11pm!!) Just wondered how long these things normally take. Thanks."
"Hi there, We are sorry to read you have found it challenging to get in contact with us recently. Could we ask that you email our social team, we would like to fully investigate this matter. Please could we ask that you include your LVE booking reference, a reminder of your issue and what you would like to do within your booking. Our email is socialteam@loveholidays.com . Thank you for reading, we hope to hear from you soon, Kind Regards, ^Ellie. Loveholidays Social Team Agent"

I have tried calling emailing live chat I am due to fly Monday with monarch I want to know how long a full refund takes as I am not willing to sit until end of week and be too late. I can't change my holiday time off
"With all due respect Amanda, you are not due to travel for another week so you are hardly anyone's priority right now. It will likely take some time to get your refund so if you are prepared to make alternative arrangements just go ahead and do it now.Edited: 2 years ago "
"When taking on the risks of booking with a third party site, you must always be prepared to buy your way out of trouble at the last minute or during the trip. People who regularly book with these sites are, whether they know it or not, playing the odds, hoping what savings they realize when the trips go well compensate for the mess that may be coming one day. I personally think that's way too much worry for the measly savings offered, but your choices may well be to pay again or stay home."
"I think wirewipre is right, Manda. With the best will in the world, LH won't be able to deal with everyone who is due to travel this wek and next week all at once. They will have to prioritise those who are due to fly before you. I realise that's inconvenient, but that's the way it is, sorry. Your turn will come."
i have booked with love holidays for may 2018 due to problems with monarch i now wish to cancel does anyone know of cancellation charges love holidays may charge
@7There certainly will be some. You need to check under Terms & Conditions on their website to get the information.
Whether/what charges will depend on what you've booked through Love Holidays.
"The immediate aftermath of the Monarch collapse should be over now, and the companies should be working their way methodically - in departure date order - any future bookings that are directly affected. That doesn't stop you being pro-active, and asking them yourself! As yours isn't until next May it could take some time to get round to you.Edited: 2 years ago "
"One for the destination experts..... Whilst customers may not be a priority in booking order or indeed not travelling for a day/week etc some people may just not have the finances or funds to re-book elsewhere surely it becomes ""Their"" priority. and the need for a speedy resolution?"
"<some people may just not have the finances or funds to re-book elsewhere surely it becomes ""Their"" priority>The problem with that statement is that it's NEVER in the consumer's interest - it's ALWAYS in the OTA's interest. But, if the OTA is not following correct procedure or timeline on refunds/disputes, then look to the credit card agency or bank. And be sure to research this the next time."
"I'm not sure what else companies can do. Surely those who are travelling soonest need and deserve to be prioritised? Once all those bookings who are already on holiday, or travelling in the next few days or weeks have been dealt with, how does a company know who is in such a position as you mention? I'm convinced that a lot of travellers will want to be first in the queue, and will say just about anything to try and achieve that.I just can't see any other way to do it other than in order of travel and order of booking.Edited: 2 years ago "
i have cancelled my holiday when will i hear from them
Only they can tell you that. Speak to them. What are you expecting to hear from them? Are you waiting for cancellation documents to make an insurance claim?
"Hello everyone, I understand the cancellation policy when protects the company against people that change their mind with one week or 1 day before the holiday is due but I can't understand why is a problem to cancel a holiday booked by mistake the next year (more than 12 months) and the mistake was spotted 5 min after booking. The payment is not even gone trough.... Can someone please help me in this matter?"
“Can someone please help me in this matter?”I would agree that it does sound unfair and would like to think good old customer service would kick in BUT there is every chance they will wish to stand by the terms and conditions.I think all you can do is be extremely nice on the phone and plead to their better nature.
"Yes, there is no way to know whether they will stand by their T&C's or whether they will provide a bit of discretionary flexibility and goodwill. All you cna do is to ask them, but don't demand anything! As T_U says, politeness goes a long way :-)"
"Hi everyone, I had the response message on the loveholidays site in which they decided to refund the trip except the flights and other small taxes. Then I replayed that I have already the cancellation confirmation from the air company. I also asked nice and polite and explain that it was only a honest mistake . I sent also an email to the media team (socialteam@loveholidays.com) and that it helped as they called me next hours , they reviewed all the information and they decided to refund the full amount. A big THANK YOU to the loveholydays team for the support  I don't have the money back yet but they said it will take up to two weeks . I am confident they will keep the promise. CheersDanielEdited: 2 years ago "
Glad that you had a positive outcome.
Currently trying to claim £400 back. Due to hospital admission/unexpected illness and being diagnosed as possibly having cancer. Under investigation. I cant go. They have had at least 2 months notice numerous calls and emails. Ive put a complaint on resolver also. Anyone have advice as to what to do next please. As stated by someone else. They are quick enough to take hard earned cash. No sympathy or understanding at all. Stay away from booking with them......
I just want my money back.
"Did you book refundable accommodation? If not why would they refund you? It makes no difference how much notice you give, you are bound by their terms and conditions as well as those of their supplier. Cancellation because of illness doesn't mean you're entitled to a refund. Make a claim on your travel insurance. Cancellation for medical problems is just one reason we buy it. Travel agents are a business like any other. If they gave sympathy refunds for every booking that was cancelled because of illness they wouldn't be in business for long.Obviously if you booked refundable accommodation and you cancelled within the refundable period then they should be refunding. If that's the case then dispute it with your card provider."
A claim via the travel insurance that you bought at the same time as your holiday will be the best route to take.
"Nic, I am not sure why you are chasing them to refund you. Yours seems to be a classic case for claiming on your Travel Insurance. That’s what it’s there for. It’s a way cost effective way to protect ourselves and our non-refundable travel bookings and holiday plans in case life events hit us hard or weather delays us, or something else means our holiday is impacted.Or didn’t you take out a Travel Insurance Policy and you want Loveholidays to change from being a Holiday Company to a charitable organisation and cover your major health crisis? If you didn’t take out Travel Insurance for your holiday and booked non-refundable then I think that’s so unfortunate and you likely won’t be getting any refund. In future I suggest researching Travel Insurance policies and making sure to get one for all future holidays. Please read this topic link I started for this forum, it’s all about Travel Insurance, it has hundreds of replies and information to read:- https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-…"
"Non refundable generally means exactly that. You could be lucky and find that a hotel or an airline will offer a gesture of goodwill, but you're not entitled to anything.It's very worrying when you are under investigation medically, with the possibility that the diagnosis will be cancer. I know that, as it's happened to me and to other members of my family. That's why I get travel insurance which provides the cover I want, including cancellation for unexpected illness or accidents.If you have insurance, please make a claim. If you don't, then I'm afraid there's nothing else you can do except concentrate on trying to get better. I wish you well."

"In that case they need to put things right asap and in my view, in recognition of their error, they should throw in a small gesture of goodwill both to your daughter and to whoever they gave the money to."
"I would advise anybody looking to book a holiday to stay clear of Loveholidays. They are terrible, please pay attention to the reviews.Don't be a fool like me!"
Cant believe the response to customers its disgusting the way some of these complaints are handled. I work for a large company and our customer service is second to none if you need some help dealing with the customers 9have treated so rudely give me a shout I will show you how it's done properly.
"Elleng228, do you work for a large discount travel company? Just like big box discount retail store, there are things you aren't paying for with a discount travel service. Customer service being one of them. That cost more."
EllenHow do you know how they're handled? You weren't party to any of them were you? The problem with forums is you only get one side of the story. Maybe LH side would be a completely different one?
"Hi blimey not sure that is quite the attitude you should of received from Love Holidays all customers are important and should be treated as so.Bad customer serviceEdited: 9:08 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Have tried to sign in but the Booking reference i type in is apparently wrong,HowEdited: 12:29 pm, March 22, 2020 "
Hi ...I read this [post with interest as recently had to cancel holiday for 19 March 2020 due to unsure whether we could get home . Glad we did but impossible to get through to them on the phone . What have people done about this ..and has anyone got a reply or general indication of whether any customer will get anything back . We don't want compensation - just refund . Thanks
There is an address at the bottom of the website page where you can write - maybe send recorded delivery
Meant to be traveling on Friday everything cancelled can't get in touch with no one at love holidays email live chat and telephone all avoidance tactics I think
"Avoidance tactics? Have you any idea how busy agents, tour operators and airlines are right now? You'll just have to be very patient, along with thousands of others I'm afraid. Have you had a text to say when they'll be in touch with you?"
"What do want to talk to them about, stephen? It's pretty clear that you won't be going anywhere. I'd wait for them to contact you, which I'm sure they will do at some point when they have the available resources to do so, and those travelling now or before you were due to travel have been dealt with."
you are liars and don't want to refund anyone trying to force people to take vouchers this is not legal
"James, this is a travel forum, we are not Loveholidays. That said, what were the terms and conditions you agreed to?"
"We were due to fly out on Monday 30 March and until today (Thursday 26 )was unable to contact them but i finally managed to get a live chat with a person today who while being helpful was unable to arrange a refund.He offered a Voucher or a re-booking of the original Holiday at different datesBoth of which are not really acceptable to us but a Voucher now seems to be our only option HOWEVER the Voucher is only valid until March 2021 which means every Day,Week and Month that passes before we out out of the Virus shortens the life of the Voucher ,i do not believe this is a fair response ??"
"It sound fair to me, a year from the original date. What would you think is fair?"
"Post 44 what does your Atol certificate say on it? If it says package, either single or multi contract then you are entitled to a refund."
if the virus goes on for 3 months or more or less the value is only what time is left on the voucher.a year would be ok but it is not year is it ?
"From what I have seen, a year from the original date is common, for flights and lodging credits. Perhaps they will be adjusted if this goes on for a longer period of time?Did you see Post #46?"
mtw42If you want that refund get on to LH about pretty quick. The EC is changing the rules in the Package Regulations and the right to a refund is going to be suspended. The PTR were never designed to cover such an event as we're seeing now. The Transport Secretary is expected to agree to this new proposal and instruct UK companies that vouchers will be issued. When that happens your voucher will be valid for 2 years. If it isn't used within that period then a refund will be issued. These vouchers will be backed by government so if the issuer fails the value of the voucher is safe. Currently any vouchers issued don't have this fall back. They become worthless if the issuer fails.
i believe LV vouchers yesterday were just for one year but your note suggests 2 which is fairer but still not a refund .thanks for the info.Michael
"It would be a refund, but only after 2 years if you didn't use the voucher. Nothing has changed as yet though, and currently your legal entitlement is to a refund within 14 days. Any vouchers LV issue now will not be financially protected, so push for a refund, even if it takes them longer than 14 days."
"Hi my partner booked a holiday to Venice with you for the 16th of March this year,we tryed getting in touch with you week's before we went but had nothing from you at all even now we have not had anything from you.we only got an email from the airline saying that the flight was cancelled.i waited for hours on your live chat only to be told that I would receive a email or text, still nothing from you."
#52Sorry but this is not LoveHolidays
Hi yes we have had issues for a number of weeks with regards to a refund. I paid love holidays the full amount but I have been told by love holidays that I have to contact Tui for the flight refund and a credit note off Love holidays. I DO NOT want a credit note. Even with the credit note that I have NOT excepted and with what Tui said I would get still does not add up to the amount I paid. We should have gone 27th March. Love Holidays did say I may get the cash refund after 31st July I do not except the credit note but today they have changed there mind again and said the time to claim the credit note will be extended.
"<< Love Holidays did say I may get the cash refund after 31st July I do not except the credit note but today they have changed there mind again and said the time to claim the credit note will be extended. >>This sounds like refund credits which Abta are hoping BEIS will approve this week. The proposal is they're a credit which can be used against another booking, or if not used then a cash refund would be applicable at the end of July. Until that is agreed/approved nothing has changed. Currently you have an absolute right to a cash refund, but it's highly unlikely you'd get it within the normal 14 days allowable."
"Thanks for the information, however I have been asking for a refund since 15th March and have been fobbed off every-time. I have had the phone conversations terminated also Live Chats with Love holiday team members ended at the mention of a cash refund. They have point blank refused.."
"They are breaking the law by refusing, but they far from being alone in doing so. Airlines, tour operators and agents are doing the same. Its understandable and vouchers or changes of dates should always be encouraged, but they cannot legally deny you a refund, yet. I'd suggest reporting them to Abta, but Abta staff are all working remotely so only contactable by email. You probably wouldn't get a reply until after refund credits have been approved. The good thing is though, if they are approved, then you will get your refund, but it would be at the end of July."
"Hi thanks again for the feedback I will contact ABTA.What it does say to me is that throughout this pandemic people will be judged both good and bad. There are many heroes currently working but also villains wanting to profiteer out of people and the situation. Within Loveholidays.com there are both, the people manning the phones at home and on site trying to help and listening to people complaining are also heroes and they deserve a mention of thanks. But Loveholidays.com also have villains, people high up the food chain making the decisions telling there call centre to not offer a cash refund or at the very least telling people who booked holidays in good faith and paid in full they are not going to get a refund for 5 months, this allows Loveholidays.com to make money on the interest from all none funded monies. Loveholidays.com also want to make money out of this pandemic by wanting to give credit notes so that people book later in the year when the cost of the holiday will increase significantly creating more profit this could be called profiteering. People book this time of the year because it’s cheaper and some people cannot afford the summer price increase."
"I'm in the same boat. My holiday to Croatia on June 2nd was booked via Love Holidays and has been fully paid. I got a text from Ryan Air on March 23rd stating that the flights had been cancelled so they offered either a refund or to change the dates. I selected the refund and submitted the form. I then went to the manage my booking area of Love Holidays and filled out their form to tell them the flight had been cancelled. I haven't heard anything back at all. I have since been told by other customers (not sure if this is true) that Ryan Air will be refunding the money to Love Holidays as that is who I book through as a package, rather than directly to my bank. I understand that a credit note will be issued in due course and if this is not used by July 31st we can 'apply' for a refund. I kind of feel like they are moving the goal posts though with the indication that the ABTA advice could change with government approval very soon, meaning that we won't be offered cash refunds at all. I would have changed my flights if I thought this would be over this year (the virus), but I can't justify paying the price increase on top of what I had already paid in full for the same holiday at a time I do not wish to go. I chose to go in June for my own reasons, so a voucher for another date won't do :("
"John Jack<< they are not going to get a refund for 5 months, this allows Loveholidays.com to make money on the interest from all none funded monies. >> It's the end of July if BEIS agrees to Abta's suggestions. They won't be earning interest because the money won't be in their account, it will be used for paying overheads, including staff wages. It's the only way they'll stay in business. They do not want to make money out of this pandemic, nor are they villains. They are right to be encouraging the uptake of refund credits, vouchers etc but not without also offering a refund, at least not until later in the week. The industry is doing this across the board because if they don't airlines, tour operators and agents will go out of business. Companies simply do not have the cash to just refund thousands of thousands of bookings. If they go under people will being waiting a lot longer than the end of July to see any money. The EC are working on amending the PTR so the right to a refund is suspended on package holidays, with vouchers being issued instead and if the voucher isn't used it would see people waiting around 2 years for a cash refund."
"Becca<< I understand that a credit note will be issued in due course and if this is not used by July 31st we can 'apply' for a refund. I kind of feel like they are moving the goal posts though with the indication that the ABTA advice could change with government approval very soon, meaning that we won't be offered cash refunds at all. >>Abta aren't proposing to remove the right to a refund, just extending the time they are allowed to refund you in. Refund credits, if not used, would mean a refund would be issued at the end of July."
I understand. Surely we should be given the option though? I can't really afford to wait 2 years for a refund on a holiday that I was due to go on in June :(
With all due respect - we were meant to travel on the 31/3 and they are refusing a refund even though they are refunding people who were not due to travel yet!
"HiWe have a trip booked to Barcelona on 10 April, but due to the corona virus we can't go . We do not want a credit note , and would like a refund as this was a trip for a special anniversary this year . I have tried to contact you via live chat and manage my booking ,but have had no luck ?"
"Jane H, this is a travel forum, and you have posted on a thread. This is not Loveholidays."
Yes...instantly gave me a credit note...no option for a refund...not impressed will take this further
"COVID-19Your website is not fit for purpose, it should be clear and straight forward to apply for money back refund....not an automatic credit note"
Let’s face it no one know what country will be able to handle tourism after this devastating virus. Or the circumstance a person emerges from it. The fact is a refund is and was part of the deal when buying the holiday. Having no job now that money will help feed the family!!!!!REFUND NOW LOVEHOLIDAYS....don’t make this harder
"OnAir440111, this is a travel forum, we are not LoveHolidays."
I have tried to contact love holidays . Holiday was for the 24th April 2020. Paid in full. I have heard absolutely nothing from love holidays. Have rungphone line goes dead. Sent numerous emails...no reply at all. I paid for the full package to love holidays in February. Just an acknowledgement by now would have been expected.
"You are like many of us that have been totally unable to speak to a person at Love Holidays.They are burying their head in the sand hoping we will all go away.Well i will not,i will chase them for as long as it takes to get my refund and i suggest we all do the same.."
why cant u refund me instead giving me a credit note. why isn't there anyone to contact either. no phones and live chat doesn't work.
"Thank you Loveholidays for my full refund!!! it took a while but that is understandable under the circumstances, I am so pleased!! we will be booking again with you in the future, once again, Thank you!!"
"did you manage to get a direct email address for love holidays, I cant find anything for them?"
"No, I spent a couple of days on the phone till I eventually got through, told them I wanted a full refund and about 30days later they refunded me!!"
I have asked for a refund and they told me know I will have to wait until the 31 of July. Ryan air have offered me my refund and I am waiting for it to me processed.I think its unfair because I still have to pay the credit card charges
"I have been told that they will refund me the full amount. Then I was told I could only have a voucher for the hotel, but had to claim the flights back myself (but I never booked the flights, they did) Then I was told there were no refunds at all and I had to accept a voucher and the flight companies have no record of my booking.LOVE (hah!) HOLIDAYS are full of excuses and will have no customers once this is over as their behavior has been shocking."
I was due to travel 11th May and obviously not. Jet2 have emailed me and said you have now been sent the refund and yet i am awaiting my refund i appreciate you are struggling but our holiday was cancelled 7th April and this is certainly longer then 2 weeks for refund.
">>>LOVE (hah!) HOLIDAYS are full of excuses and will have no customers once this is over as their behavior has been shocking.<<<The question is, assuming they do survive, whether the number of customers they get in the future will be enough to keep them going. That's because there will always be people who don't care who they use, don't research a company before using them, don't read the T&C's and who don't care what problems others have as long as they think they are getting a good deal.>>>our holiday was cancelled 7th April and this is certainly longer then 2 weeks for refund.<<<Susan, how long is it since Jet2 told you that they had issued the refund? Even if it's more than two weeks, many people are now discovering that everything is taking much longer than it did in the before times.I don't know if your card provider would be able to do anything to speed things up, but you could try that path and see."
Can you help me with a phone number?
Yep love hopidays are a law breaking joke and will never use again they dont reply and are still taking peoples moneY they are saying they have got to get refunded first sorry love hopidays it dont work like that
"thelarr,Yes it does work like that, you should read the thousands of postings on many of these TripAdvisor travel forums about all kinds of booking companies people chose to use. If you book through a holiday company or third-party agency, the airline or hotel may provide a refund to the agency, and the agency then deducts fees and in their own sweet time passes any balance to you."
"thelarr, I'm afraid that Avanti is right and though you might think it doesn't work like that, in reality it does. You pay the third party and then they pay the suppliers. If a service is cancelled. the supplier returns the money to the agent and they pass it back to you. Minus the fees you agreed to them charging when you made the booking."
Love holiday have been disappointing with the way they have handled customer cash refunds. They keep fobbing people of. They have breached there own refund policy and breached the package holidays travel regulations by trying to force customers to take a voucher. The staff are rude
You can report them to the CMA if you believe they have gone too far via this linkhttps:/…competition-and-markets-authorityPlease remember that it's not illegal for them to offer a voucher or try and persuade you to accept it. It remains your choice.
"How can they try to force you into taking a voucher? Of course they'd prefer you took a voucher/vouchers because that's all they'll be getting from their suppliers in the majority of cases. If you don't want one just say you want a refund. You'll have to be prepared to wait for it though. Most companies are taking a long time to refund, which is understandable given the workload they've got."
"Good afternoon, we had our accommodation that was for 12th May - 19th May 2020 cancelled by the hotel, not by ourselves and are still waiting for a refund. Could you please advise us why we are still waiting for our refund?"

@juniper99This is a Trip Advisor public forum. You are not actually corresponding directly with LoveHolidays. Whilst there was/is a representative from the company who did post and responded in the past they appear not to have done so for a while. If you look back to post #1 you will see the representatives details. Click on their username and you can send a private message.
I expect that when you do manage to contact their reply will be a standard one saying something along the lines of exceptional demand leading to delays in processing times. I'd just be patient at this point.
Still waiting to get her money back we cancelled it a month ago will text them but they're not answering we booked a holiday with on the beach for September they gave us and money back within 2 days so I don't know why I love holidays

I have e-mailed you twice on this e_mail address and not once have you contacted me.we cant phone because you have suspended phone lines and your live chat is impossible to get on.in other words you are unreachable.not professional at all

"I don't recall ever seeing LH posting here. Vmac, you need to pay a bit more attention to what you're doing online. There are lots of spiders on the web, and some of them are very poisonous.Fortunately, mistaking a travel discussion board for a holiday company isn't a serious error, but do please be vigilant or you could end up on a dangerous site."
Yes I have had problems totall nitemare do not book a holiaday with love holiaday... They cancelled my hol understandably as I was due yo fly in May... They said I woukd be due a refund within 28 days... I have documentation that the flights were refunded by jet 2 to company.. I am still waiting... No chat line... No E mail that works no phone number I think they going into liquidation judging by no contact
"Dispute it with your credit card, Kate"
I haven't received a full refund lovehol refunded the flights after a 40 day wait.... After they said I'd get full refund in 28 days... I am now waiting for the accommodation refund!!!!! Booking ref LOV1796174 miss Emsley
"kate, you can either carry on waiting or you can try and get your card provider involved. I suspect your issue is that LH booked flights and accommodation separately, and have to wait for the airline and the hotel to refund them before they can pass the money on to you.I think that with the benefit of hindsight, LH might well now agree that a refund within 28 days was ludicrously optimistic."
I too am waiting for a refund from Love Holidays re a holiday to Cape Verde that was cancelled in May. It is worrying that I cannot contact them except by their Live Chat which is most of the time not available. I have been offered a refund credit note but being over 70 I do not know when I will be able to travel again. The last time I spoke to their Live Chat I was told I would get a refund but I want to know when!
"#101When you receive your refund credit note it should indicate a point in time when you can exchange for a cash refund if you do not wish to use it for a rebooked trip. Dates seem to vary between operators depending when their bonding or a trade membership is renewed.Edited: 12:49 pm, June 16, 2020 "
I booked a complete package holiday with Love Holidays for early May 2020.How come Love Holidays aren't refunding the airfare part? I contacted Easyjet and they said that as I didn't personally book direct with them - I need to go back to Love Holidays. I'm going from pillar to post .............
"#103Rather than a ""package holiday"" I think you have instead purchased two or more travel components from LV. This is classed as a Linked Travel Arrangement. For a ""package holiday"" think more what you but from TUI, Jet2 Holidays, Olympic Holidays, Virgin Holidays etc.Whilst you do have protection for timely refunds under the Package Travel Regulations many are finding that these online travel firms who cobble together holidays are waiting on refunds from their suppliers before they pass the refunds back to the customer. I suspect this, together with general chaos and being busy, has meant that the airfare part of your trip is still pending refund.Some airlines have been better than others in terms of refunding. Some initially took the route of credits only and then after pressure started to refund (I think EasyJet was one). Your flights could be caught up in this web.I think all you can really do is have regular attempts to speak with them and push home you are awaiting a refund on the cancelled flight. If you get fed up and you paid by credit card you could have dialogue with them and see if a charge back is possible."
Hi guysI was due to go to sunset beach in Malaga on the 12th of March 2020.My holiday was cancelled due to covid.I would like some communication re my options now.
what kind of communication are you looking for?There is 3 years worth of advice in this thread.
"Annette,This is just a travel chat forum on Tripadvisor where all of us travellers discuss issues with holiday bookings. Nobody here is a Rep for LoveHolidays so it may be best to communicate with them about your refund options."
#105Was that the first weekend of travel disruption to Spain. What happened in your case? Have you been in contact with LH at all?
Why are you not refunding your customers. You keep saying live chat or email. But emails come back it in a no reply link we are going round in circles and you owe me £1169.58 and it’s been months. Do the right thing and pay us back NOW
Ronni: this thread has three years of complaints. Why would you ever use them?Have you tried a chargeback with your credit card?FIND these threads BEFORE you give your money to strangers
I have been waiting since 24th April for my refund
"Ronnie ""Have you tried a chargeback with your credit card?""This forum is not Loveholidays. It is a public travel forum where volunteers help others plan trips."
"""""Rather than a ""package holiday"" I think you have instead purchased two or more travel components from LV. This is classed as a Linked Travel Arrangement.""""That wont be the case in will be a package LV sell atol protected package it dose not matter that you choose your flight and then hotel as long as its a single point of sale and the customer chooses the services before agreeing to pay thats classed as a package.Package travel covers all sales which include two or more different types of travel services for the same trip/holiday which are booked under a single contract with one supplier. Package travel also includes sales where services are booked with different suppliers under separate contracts as long as the above appliesEdited: 1:56 pm, June 21, 2020 "
Hello Can anyone help ...Love holidays. ..unable to speak to anyone regarding my refundaughter thanks
"skim them thread, Marian. 3 years of complaints and attempts to reach this company. If you can provide some details like dates and places and who canceled things we can help"
"Ronnirloo,Nobody here on this public forum is connected to or works for LoveHolidays so nobody here sent you an email."
"Hi all, we are supposed to leave for our long awaited getaway on 31/06/2020, due to our flight being cancelled & not being able to fly, we are not going to get to our accommodation that's booked. I have tryed with loveholidays to get something done & have got nowhere at all. I am so very disserpointed. Can someone help with advice please. Cheerz Malissa McIntyre"
"You're not alone, I'm sure, Ronnirioo. In the various forums I visit, many people report waiting months for a refund, even from what are normally very good companies. It's a sign of the huge disruption the health crisis has caused."
"Love Holiday in Tallahasse florida is not a good place to book. The codes they give will not allow you to open the management part of your trip and they will not call you back. Buyer do not at any cost use this group. Pay a little extra but you will be able to manage your things correctly.Edited: 6:08 pm, June 25, 2020 "
Does anybody know if anyone has actually got a refund from loveholidays as we were due to go on the 12th may I have contacted them numerous times taking hours to get on live chat everyone I’ve spoken to has given me different information I know that easyJet have already refunded the flight part of my holiday to them but still have not heard anything from them
The social team email you gave us is invalid.
"Ronnirioo, who gave you an e-mail?"
Can anybody on here post a link to the Love Holidays 'live chat line'. Impossible to find. Due to go on the 14th July to Greece need options.
Please could you contact me and let me know what you are doing about my cancelled holiday LOV1800407. We were in lockdown from day one of our holiday and and the hotel shut down 2days after. We had to make our own way home. We tried ringing you but the phone was dead.
"They don’t post here, Peter. The don’t read here, either. Skim this discussions they are not a good company. Three years of complaints right here. You MUST do research before you give your money away"
"Peter,It’s just us travellers on this forum. We can’t help you or contact you. If you saw reply 1 of this topic is that the person you are trying to talk to? That person in reply #1 was a LoveHolidays company Rep/Staff but that forum posting is over 3 years old and that LoveHolidays Rep has not posted on this topic or anywhere on TripAdvisor since February, 2017. If you want to speak to LoveHolidays staff then contact them via their website contact details."
"We booked through ‘love holidays’ for a trip to fuerteventura for 5th of may, this has obviously been cancelled, however , when we contact ‘love holidays’ they state that of the £350 that we had already paid £330 had paid for the flights by Ryanair and we have to now chase them for the refund !!! How is this right seeing as we booked through them ????"
"it isn't right, but you picked a company without much customer service, which is why we have many threads here with many complaints. If you wanted customer service you should book direct or with a Full Service agency.You are going to have to get confirmation that Ryan repaid them, and then chase them for your money. You can also then raise a dispute with your bankcard if LH doesn't come thru"
Love holidays please let me know if holiday is cancelled. Due to fly 15th july but flights confirmed as cancelled. I cannot get on.manage my booking and final payment is due on 1st july... help
"LH doesn’t read this, sorry. Good luck with your trip, I hope it works out"
Having trouble getting in contact with love holidays like most as online chat is only option im due to go away 23rd july and flights are cancelled so how can anyone get through to yous please?
MariaYou are on a community forum and not addressing LoveHolidays directly. Whilst a LH rep used to post occasionally I have not seen them do so for some time.LoveHolidays online chat seems to be the only method to reach them at the moment but you have to try this at certain times. Their website explains and gives the webchat open times.Persistence is key although for 24th July I suspect they are as much in the dark as you might be on to whether the holiday will continue. Awaiting news from Team Boris on travel corridors and FCO travel advisories.
"Beware - Loveholidays were a lot cheaper than the hotels own website. I thought as they were on Trivago they could be trusted! However, I prefer to book direct with the hotel having had major problems with Prestigia - also via Trivago - and so contacted them. I was told that they dont deal with Loveholidays and have no idea where they got their rates from! Needless to say I didnt proceed with the booking through Loveholidays!!"
"I have been attempting to contact Love Holidays for the past six weeks without success in an attempt to gain full refund for package holiday booked and paid for six months ago (LOV1729995U). Despite assurances that no-one will lose money due to cancellation,and that a process to claim a full refund rather than a credit note is available, this does not appear to be the case. I posted a critical revue on Trustpilot which elicited a response to the effect that my request was in hand, but I fear they were just empty words for the benefit of review readers since Love Holidays have so far not had the courtesy to speak/e-mail me direct.I have booked several holidays with Love Holidays and each time they have been highly proficient and faultless and I have been quick to praise their organisation and superb value for money, however when things go wrong their organisation and efficiency is deplorable and I will consider my options very carefully when next booking a holiday... as things stand at the moment I would caution against booking with a company that appears to have total disregard for customer relations and seems oblivious to the fact that they are in clear breach of the Package Travel Regulations."
"Hi yes I’ve sent them multiple emails , there is no chance what’s so ever getting on the live chat you cannot contact them by phone it’s impossible tui have refunded love holidays back for flights but still nothing off love holidays it’s disgusting as a business they you can treat people like this you was ok taking everyone money but don’t want to refund it I even sent emails saying I’ll book with you again for next year no chance now"
"I think part of the problem with these online travel firms is that their whole business model is built around tech and automated processes. Fewer manual interactions with fewer staff means cheaper headline prices. Of course this might be fine when everything is working well but any travel disruption then they just don’t have the staff to support and back up any service to customers, Perhaps something to consider moving forward when searching and booking with online companies and seeking price over service."
"Yes. We have tried to contact them to no avail. My holiday was 3rd April. I challenged the transaction with my American Express. Love holidays refused to give AMEX the money back. TUI did it straight away. So not sure as and when I will revive our money back but I would never book with love holidays ever. The point is they don’t respond to anything. Messages through manage my bookings don’t get responded to. Their Covid-19 update states you can have your cash back, by processing the action through manage my bookings. This is a tick box exercise to show people they are doing it. They certainly are not. There isn’t even an option for it. You have to send an email or message. Yes you guessed it no response. Shocking and hat they have done to people."
"I have been trying to contact them for 3months. I have sent umpteen emails and they have not replied to any.Have tried live chat and been cut off before I had explained my case.disgusted with them.Edited: 4:37 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Managed to get onto so called live chat, and after four hours was head of queue; automated response came on asking for security answers, but when I immediately stated to type response was cut off saying as not heard from me for a while so was cancelling chat! Strongly suspect it is not Live Chat but a robot. Customer relations is non existent and would warn anyone booking with LH in the future to think again...Been waiting nearly four months for a reply and refund."
"I've used live chat quite a few times and it can be very inconsistent, even with the same company. That being said, I'm no fan of LH and I suspect that they won't have invested in the greatest IT in the world. Or customer service for that matter."
I will never book with LOV1800407 love holiday s again you can never contact them. I have sent about 20 emails and not one reply.
Peter BYour location shows you in the U.K. yet you are referencing Love Holidays USA operation. Did you book via their U.K. operation or US one? Which email address have you been using? Have you tried to access and manage you booking online or calling them (picking the correct U.K. or US number)?
Yes I have used the same email address that I booked the holiday with. I have also used the social team email to no avail.
"What about Manage My Booking via their website?Alternatively, if you look back on this thread you will find a LH Rep used to post. You could try sending them a private message. Click on their user name (highlighted in blue under the profile image) and follow instructions on sending a private message."
I just want to know if I can keep my flight?? LOV1930495U.
LOV1930495U Just want to know if can keep my flight??
"Melanie, this is not Loveholidays, you will need to contact them."
All I want is phone number to talk to someone at love holidays?? As wont reply live chat or email
"Melanie,I’ve never seen any phone number for them given out on these forums. Also I doubt the company Rep who used to post years ago will notice your request here or respond to Private Messages. That company Rep has not done anything on Tripadvisor for at least 2-3 years. I’d say that person is long gone.I don’t know why LoveHolidays isn’t answering live chat or emails just now. It must be frustrating for all of you who booked with them. Do they have a Facebook page?"
"My holiday to Portugal was cancelled by Love holidays on May 8th. I choose the refund option. I have messaged them via the manage my booking app, I have emailed them, tried the web chat, messaged on messenger and they answer nothing. My sister was booked on the same flight with Easyjet and she has had her refund 2 weeks ago, 31st May. Love holidays are a joke, a waste of time and I will never use them again nor advise anyone to use them."
All the online agencies are having trouble with refunds. The bad ones are having harder times. Did you skim this thread before you gave them your money?Has your sister always made better researched choices than you?
Totally agree. They are pathetic.
Still waiting for my refund since 15 April
"Don’t expect anything soon, I paid extra for my holiday back in December so I could cancel if needed NOT because of Coronavirus, I cancelled my holiday 23rd March, supposed to depart tomorrow and I am still waiting for my refund. Love holidays say 8 weeks from cancellation well , currently I am on 16 weeks so don’t hold your breath. They are appalling!"
"Still waiting for my refund, was due to fly out to Greece on the 2/7/20 but it was cancelled due to the pandemic. Not able to contact them at all and the only email I had from them was to confirm my refund. Will not book with them again"
"It is reported in the paper today that Loveholidays have put an "" extra 50 staff per day"" on getting people their refunds and have already returned £23 million.Don't hold your breath.Also a friend of a friend arrived in Spain yesterday to find their hotel closed. Cost them £700 checking in to somewhere else.Whenever I have done a dummy booking with this company I have never found them cheaper taking in to account flights, hotel, transfers, luggage.Is this just me?"
Please use this company at your pearl they take your money and cancel your holiday . If you take a voucher please be aware it is minus your flight fare as they say they have to wait for the airline company to pay them which is Lies a package holiday should be payed back in full this was confirmed by Trading standards please check this website CMA.GOV.UK TO LOOK AT THE OPEN LETTER TO THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY WHICH STATES THAT COMPANIES ARE BENDING THE RULES REGARDING REFUNDS ECT the more people who complain the faster these companies will be brought to justice as it should be if you break the law.
Love Holidays sent a message on 2nd July regarding our cancelled holiday we can no longer look at our booking and I have been on the chat for 5 hours and still unable to know when I will get my refund. Love Holidays say TUI will return the flight money to us Today TUI said this is not true and love holidays are passing the buck including flights Love Holidays have over 2000 pounds and we should at least know a date of our refund
"EugeneAs you were flying with Tui , a recognised UK based major airline why did you not book direct with them?"
"I got my refund in two parts, firstly for the accomodation part of the package and the second payment was paid into my bank two weeks after the airline refunded loveholidays.Their online messaging service wasn't great but their automated telephone line worked out fine for me.This was for a trip, cancelled in April.Edited: 3:44 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"Still waiting for our flight refunds from april 19th and may 30th , absolute disgrace of a company"
TO ALL LOVE HOLIDAY PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING NOWHERE WITH REFUNDS GO TO Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA WEBSITE) these are the only people who can take action against companies who break the rules the more complaints the faster we will get justice.for the stress this company is causing to people.
"I have reported them to the cma a few wks ago, they are absolutely awful, emails bounce back, really rude live chat agents, I have rang only twice and these people were ok, but still not received our flights refunds from april 19th and may 30th, webare pensioners and save hard for our holidays out of our pension, we feel totally disrespected and beaten by them"
Hi folks please put this below into you browser you will see the warning given to holiday companies.CMA open letter to package travel sector PLEASE MAKE A COMPLAINT
When am I going to receive my holiday refund my holiday booking number is lov186617ou my name is BarrySchofield. If do not receive a reply after several attempts will be forced to go to omnedsman mrbarry Schofield
"Culture769660, we are not Loveholidays. This is a public forum, Bargain Travel, on the Trip Advisor site that helps people plan trips. We have no idea when you will get your refund. As you can see by all the posts before yours, it is a common problem."
"Barry: Don't post personal info like that on the web, someone else could take that info and try to collect your refund instead of yours. Remove your post!"
I've been trying to get my money back over £800 for a while now I booked a holiday with loveholidays and it got cancelled I waited a month or so then booked another holiday and they cancelled that since then I have been trying to get my money back but there is no way of getting I touch with them they are conning people out of there money and have no intention of giving it back they are fraudsters
I'm still waiting a refund from easyjet .bloody nitemare not happy .need to hurry up .this is since april ..
"It's rediculus! I had two holidays booked with Love Holidays. I was optimistic when they cancelled the Flights in March for April and I re-scheduled them to August, I even paid the air line an extra 120 euros, then that got cancelled so I opted for a refund but I was told by everyone that they were being pushed to take vouchers so I changed the dates to the same dates instead, then decided it's too risky to travel to Portugal since it's not on the Green List and Ryanair refused to change the dates or destination even though I changed it on 16th June and it's free for all new flights booked as of 10th June , change fee waived, but yet they still refuse. Then, Love Holidays cancelled the Ibiza Holiday and I just said NO, I just want my money back now, I'm not re-scheduling again, it didn't work out before. I cancelled the flights as per the Love Holidays Rep instructions and Ryanair. I was told my flights would be cancelled in a week, that someone would contact me. I was on the chat at least 4 times. I just want my money back now. I've had to fork out for new flights to a green list country at my own expense, and I would like the rest of my money back for the accomodation. I'll probably loose the 520 from the Portugal flights. My rights are payment within 14 days of cancellation. Also, I am still scheduled for Love Holidays to take payments. Oh they think it makes it ok if they tell you not to cancel online because then they are contracted to pay you within 14 days and yet still be taking money from your account. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!!!"
Hi jet2 sent my flight refund back to them over 2 weeks ago £560 and I cannot get it back of them I get no reply I have put it in the hands of the small claims court Best off luck
I think expecting a refund within two weeks was probably wishful thinking.Glad to hear that the airline has refunded the agent. I however suspect you may need to apply patience before LH work through the administration and arrange the refund back to you.
"I fear that the small claims court will take longer than the refund. I agree with T_U that 2 weeks is not realistic for a third party to pass on the money at this time. It should be a reasonable target but even pre pandemic things would take longer than that, on average."
from customer of love holidays i think you are wasting your time trying to get in touch with love holidays ertainly at weekends its completely impossible no one in available to contact. the only chance is you go on love holidays live chat which i have found out gos onlinee 9am monday to friay but dont hold yor breath that you ill get through.i intend to write to them you will find theaddress on live chat page.good luck your certainly go to need it
when am igiong to get my refund i cancel te holiiday almost 10days aggo made six attempts before i got anywhere
"10 days? Places are taking 3-4 months, dude. Unique times."
"Kenneth, if all you want to know is when you're going to get your money then you may as well just give up. Even if you do get to speak to someone the chances are they'll either make something up or just trot out the same, standard, meaningless answer the system tells everyone.Give it a couple of months at least."
"We are going to Portugal on Friday 28th August. The flights are still live but we had a message left from Love holidays last Sat telling us our hotel is closed, We have been trying everyday to contact them to either get a refund or a new hotel. If you do speak to someone my husband was on the phone for 2 hours before someone answered they just pass the buck and say they will get in touch.Holidays are happy times not getting stessed .They just need to tell us what’s happening a refund or us to fine a new hotel which I believe will be easy when we get there.Will NEVER use Love Holidays again."
"I'm not going to argue with your decision, katrina. I have never used LH and I never will.I'd just like to point out that there are other websites that are as poor as LH or even worse. I'm sure you don't want to end up in the same position with dreadful customer service again, so it would be wise to be very vigilant in checking out a company's reputation before giving them your money."
"Hi there allI booked with Loveholidays.com 0ne week holiday to Tenerife for January 2021, final payment due 24th December 2020 .. we have decided to cancel due to the uncertainty of travel over Covid virusWhen i try to contact, NO luck with live chat .. No luck via telephone .. so tried to cancel online, with flights and cancelation fees they tell me to cancel now (4 months before travel !! ) that it will cost me £410 TO CANCEL STAY AWAY from this company"
Don’t cancel then.If you cancel at this time then you will of course find you are liable for cancellation charges in line with those you agreed to when you booked. You are of course free to do so but have to accept you face possible financial loss.A lot can happen between now and January. Why not just wait to see how things pan out. If closer to your departure date in January and there are still travel restrictions then other options may be available.Somewhat unfair I think to shout to stay away from this company purely because the booking terms and conditions on payments and changes to holidays are being kept.
"HelloI don't think i was unfair because your website said NO cancellation fees charged by loveholidays.com and of course i don't expect to be charge free for cancellation but aprox 35-40% of the cost of holiday surely cannot be fair.I am of not wanting to cancel closer to January in fear of incurring the full cost of the holiday to pay if covid cancellation of flights and holiday are not in place , so when is the last date that i can cancel ?Also find that through criticism i get an immediate response but nothing from all avenues trying to contact the company loveholidays.com directJohn"
"We were promised a refund 3months ago, we are still waiting. No contact or any information or updates whatsoever."
"#184 @john II think you will find the “No Cancellation fees” flash was for certain products and certain room rate plans. It is not on the full holiday or all holidays.From the Love Holidays website and their terms & conditions -Quote:How do I cancel my booking and what will the charges be?- If you wish to cancel your booking, please log on to our handy Manage My Booking tool. You will need your LOV reference and the lead passenger's name to log in.- In Manage My Booking you can generate a cancellation quote that lays out what costs will be incurred if you cancel your booking with us. It also details any monies that will be refunded to you.- Cancelling a booking with multiple Service Providers is complicated, and as such we charge an administration fee to cover the cost of processing cancellation requests as confirmed in our booking terms and conditions.- Cancellation is always subject to fees from your Service Providers, and these are as follows:Flights:Flights are non-refundable from the point of booking and therefore the cost of your flight cannot be refunded.AccommodationWhilst some hotels can be cancelled at no additional cost, some may charge a partial cancellation fee; others can charge in full. If you selected a non-refundable room at the time of booking, then there will be no refund due when cancelling.Other products / ancillaries:Transfers are non-refundable from the point of bookingAncillaries such as car hire, and airport parking will be dependent on the Service ProviderEnd quote:I suspect the charge you are being quoted is for the non-refundable flights."
"HelloMany thanks for your efforts in replying to my post, the hotel is refundable (although not paid for ) which i assume if i haven't paid for it then there will be no claim on me, but the rest of the booking is as you have said non-refundable, so this is a classic mistake made by myself at booking for not reading the print Kindest Regards John"
