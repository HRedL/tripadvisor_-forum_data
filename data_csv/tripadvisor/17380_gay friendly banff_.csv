"My girlfriend and I will be in Banff for a week (NY eve included). Are there any gay/friendly places to go ? Any jazz venues perhaps ? Will any ski fields be open NY day ? if you had 4 days to spend sightseeing, what sites would you NOT miss ?"
"All ski resorts are open NY Day. Must see lake louise, stay 1 night at the top of Sunshine Village in Banff, Canmore is nice and a day in Calgary is good too."
"Try the ""aurora"" Great place to party and dance! No Jazz there though. As for gay friendly, any goes in Banff!! Be careful though.(aids capital of Norh America) Its an epidemic there."

"While Canada in general is a gay-friendly destination, Alberta in particular is not. We're the only province that is actively looking for ways to stop the impending gay marriage law. While I believe the majority of people are fine with it, hand-holding or kissing is never seen, so a the very least it could be shocking. And the people not okay with it are quite vocal (as you have witnessed). So although Banff may be an exception, I'd advise you to be discreet until you get there (from the Calgary or Edmonton airport). "
"I agree that gay handholding and kissing are not common in Alberta, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they are NEVER seen. My partner and I live in Edmonton and we hold hands in public all the time. We get some stares, but the only time anyone ever bothered us was when some teenagers driving by in a car yelled ""fags"" (which we thought was pretty funny since we are women). "
"HiI'm sorry if I was a bit on the rude side. I do not believe in gay marrage but I do still have a respect for gay people. I not sure weather or not Banff has any gay friendly places but I see you have already had you trip. Anyway I'm sorry for my blunt words!!Sincerly, Barkley"
"Hi Barkley. I appreciate the apology, but I want you to know that your comments were more than ""a bit"" on the rude side. You say that you have respect for gay people, but where I come from calling someone ""sick"" is not considered respectful. "
"Barkleythedog: I must agree with chucklebelly. I am gay, and was quite offended by your original post. Your apology notwithstanding, it's inappropriate to use Tripadvisor forums to express ideological viewpoints. There are plenty of other web sites to voice your opinions on such matters. Just follow the old axiom of, ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."""
I dont think you should show PDA in canada outside some parts of the biggest cities. 
"Good Evening!It seems like everyone posting isn't actually from Banff/Canmore, so let me help, Banff/Canmore is great compared to Calgary... That's not saying a lot, yes, two women dancing is good, but two guys??? I can tell you that we have gone out here and people say things, and make you feel unwelcome. I would say that you should head to whistler or somewhere in Ontario. But if your going to come, check out the Saltlik, the steak is amazing!-D "
"Just a note, before many people respond to this thread, that the original question and responses date back to 2004/05."
"ya, realized that after the fact"
