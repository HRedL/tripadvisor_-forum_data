"Yes, the health care workers from the infirmary at Viva Dominicus, who worked with the first case, the man from Italy, are now in quarantine at a military base. I wonder how long the rest of the staff is quarantined? :(https:/…"
I've always read such good things about medical professionals in the DR ... :(
Good for them for being proactive.
"thankfully quarantined and not infected, feel bad if they are not infected though.... who's going to pay their salary? Who's going to look after their kids :-( Maybe they'll let them go home and self-quarantine?"
I agree Deb. It is a very sad situation.
"I have to say..regardless of where you work, in whatever country if your company is not going to pay you or dismiss you for this issue...time to find a new place to work. Canada, America...wherever.As for looking after kids, most working in resorts at whatever level see very little of their kids...Grandma or mom are looking after the kids.Deb...you know the cycle...12 days on...one day on the bus to get home...one day to hug your kids and another day back on the bus to spend the next 12 days saying...""you my family""! Lol"
"You're right Mike.My comment was just a generalization for anyone in this situation.I'll be seeing my family soon :-) HopefullyNo cases in Manitoba thus far,,, just Ontario and BC"

""" . I was going to, but I have been accused of being a pot stirrer and fear mongerer. ""As well you should be .., claiming how many people were going to be sick , when there was not one confirmed case in all of PC.., fearmongering , simple as that ."
