"I asked this question on the Maui Forum it's just starting to pickup speed, so I thought I'd ask the same question here since so many visitors come to Las Vegas from overseas.Is the outbreak of the Corona Virus starting to altering your travel plans to Las Vegas?"
The Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is not affecting my thoughts more than common flu. Common flu is causing more complications/deaths throughout the world than 2019-nCoV.I hope the current hype doesn't affect attendance or celebrations in Las Vegas. 2019-nCoV is no more of a consideration for me than common flu that might be happening in Las Vegas.
i must admit this has crossed my mind but as my flights are booked i will still be going unless the foreign office says otherwise
"Every time there is a new strain of the flu, hysteria breaks out. No, the outbreak of the coronavirus won't alter my travel plans."
Not at all. Why should it? I could always barricade myself at home until it's all over I suppose.
I was on the Strip over the past several days and many Chinese and Asian visitors are wearing masks. LAS airport and other airports in the US may start to restrict direct flights from China to the USA.This is a very popular time for Asians to visit Las Vegas with Chinese New Year. They bring a lot of $$$ to gamble. Time will tell on this.
"Asian gamblers from Asia no longer go to Las Vegas, they go Macau, casinos are booming there. The Asians you see in Las Vegas are Americans, nothing to do with Coronavirus."

"Just the facts, ma’am.“ The number of Chinese tourists to the western U.S. state of Nevada has been booming in recent years, who have significantly contributed to the local economy, a tourism official said.Tourism remains Nevada's No.1 industry, driven greatly by the influx of Chinese, said Bethany Drysdale, chief communications officer of Nevada Division of Tourism, in a recent interview with Xinhua via email.Drysdale noted that the Silver State has witnessed an increase in Chinese visitation year over year since Nevada began to market travel to China in 2004.”https:/…index.html"
"What if there were Chinese visitors in Oroville, CA? Would you go to Vegas to eacape?"
I'm watching to see if it lowers hotel or flight prices temporarily.
"Would'nt change my trip to Vegas at all. I may be more aware of hand-washing after touching the slots or other things,but Im not worried at all. As said above,the flu thats here now is more concerning."
"No. I'll just keep drinking Corona Lights with lime and hope I don't get the regular flu, coronavirus, bronchitis, mono, or any other illness."
"@10 Lol, Chinese visitors to Oroville. Not worried no one visits Oroville."
"I will admit, to wondering if we know the true facts about the virus. 50m+ people under quarantine, building three 1,000 bed morgue like hospitals in 10 days and US officials being much more proactive about stopping the virus from reaching our shores than other previous viruses. The flu ""seems"" more concerning, so why don't we take all the above precautions to stop the flu???OK the tin foil hat fell off, time to travel to Vegas."
"Eh, one of the US patients is in a hospital 30 mins from me and reports to be doing ok in isolation. Am I any safer here than Vegas? While the death toll seem to be around 5% in China, maybe I'm just privileged in thinking as a middle age American with good insurance that I'd be OK."
"""Is the outbreak of the Corona Virus starting to altering your travel plans to Las Vegas?""No."
"""While the death toll seem to be around 5% in China, maybe I'm just privileged in thinking as a middle age American with good insurance that I'd be OK.""Huh?"
Trip is booked for April.....not going to change a thing and have no intentions of wearing a mask. You are more likely to get shot in Las Vegas than catching this and dying from it would be my guess.
"To Las Vegas? No. I'm not due there for awhile. But for my travel plans next week, yes, I'm concerned.I volunteer at LAX at arrivals in the Tom Bradley International Terminal. Last weekend, the number of people in masks, arriving passengers/crew and others, was enormous. Very sobering to see in person. We've received updates on how to deal with the issues (dealing with those who are ill, disinfecting workspace and hands frequently, etc.). Folks are understandably nervous.I have a compromised immune system, so I checked in with my doctor. She said I could travel, but to come in for a checkup as soon as I get back. And my sister, who I'm visiting, is a health professional. So I'll be in good company. But I'm still very aware of the scenario that's unfolding and also wonder what the full story may be."
"""You are more likely to get shot in Las Vegas than catching this and dying from it would be my guess.""Too soon in its potential to spread to make that statement. Lots can change in three months. Reference the ""Spanish"" flu epidemic of 1918. https:/…Spread"
"From CNN:How Wuhan coronavirus compares to SARSFrom CNN's James Griffiths and Julia HollingsworthMore than 6,000 people worldwide have been infected globally since the first confirmed case of the Wuhan coronavirus in December.By comparison, there were 8,098 confirmed cases of SARS between November 2002 to July 2003.To put this into context: It has taken less than two months to get infect around 75% of the number infected by SARS over a nine month period.Experts have previously estimated the Wuhan virus figures could still be vastly under-reported, making the novel coronavirus far more contagious, but also less deadly, than SARS so far.https:/…index.htmlSpreading much faster than SARS but as of now not as deadly. As of now the risk of getting this in the US is VERY SMALL."

Knowledge on how to contain it and fight it is not even close. DNA sequencing was not possible. Now it is. That's just one piece that's possible now. Already working on a vaccine. Best guess it will be available in 3 months. Please don't be an alarmist."
"#22 versus #23, like punching yourself in the nose."
"And I still go back to the number of flu related deaths in the US in 2019. Adds a bit of context from my perspective. Not changing my plans a week from now. But everyone has their own comfort level.Cheers,Jay"
CNN? Fake news. Fox didn't even mention the corona virus.
FOX News??? for conservatives who still think the world is flat.One big issue with today's viruses is that people move around so much and so far that the speed of infection is still much faster than science.

“ ·#41 reported for spamming the forums.”#42 reported for being off topic.
No - - Flights booked / hotel booked and I am anxiously awaiting my trip in 75 days !
Nope. I can't WAIT for my Vegas trip in May.
Yes
#41 and #42 have been reported for too much reporting.
"This is nothing more than a bad case of the Flu. Like a Dr said on a national news site. Wash your hands don't touch your face after handling public rails, grocery carts etc.. Treat it like Flu season and you will be fine. with this scare I am taking advantage of all the great flight cost and hotel/casinos dropping there rates"
"""This is nothing more than a bad case of the Flu.""Not even close to accurate."
"The only thing that will stop my planned trip to Vegas at end of April is if the airlines stops the flight or the Hotels close down. Over 40,000 people have died from the flu and the most I have heard about that is here on this forum. I think a lot of this hype is politically motivated and do not plan at age 65 to stop doing what I enjoy."
Politically motivated? That’s some crazy theory ya got going on...The next thing you will tell us is that Matt Getz and the new chief of staff currently quarantined with possible Covid 19 were given it by MSM
"Haven't booked anything as of yet, but plan on being in Vegas at the end of October. Surely by then, the virus will be gone"
It has begun: https://www.ktnv.com/news/mgm-resorts-tempor…
"Wildhorse Casino in Oregon closed because an employee might have the virus. Despite all the efforts that the properties are making, any one can close abruptly because of one guest or employee"
"I'm slightly concerned, but more about if they issue a mandatory quarantine or something once we are there (we are from Boston) and will have the dogs with a sitter. We are visiting with my in-laws (who are in their 80s), but in better health than most 50 year-olds, so who knows. We are due to leave April 18; I'm sure a lot will change over the month."
“ Wildhorse Casino in Oregon closed because an employee might have the virus”And it reopened about 36 hours later. About a week ago.
"South Korea, one of the most infected nations, has one of the lowest fatality rates. South Korea can test 15,000/day.Look at them..then look at us."
"""We are visiting with my in-laws (who are in their 80s), but in better health than most 50 year-olds,"" - This is a ludicrous statement. They might be healthy, but due to their age alone are more susceptible to any illness.13"
"South Korea, one of the most infected nations, has one of the lowest fatality rates. South Korea can test 15,000/day.Look at them..then look at us.<<<I flew through Incheon airport last week, it was a ghost town. Landed in Atlanta, and it bustling busier than ever. Either SK is taking this too seriously, or we are taking it too lightly."
"Preliminary data indicates past the age of 79 there is a 30%+ chance that you will require hospitalization if you get COVID-19. That means a month on a ventilator letting you breathe. Ventilators that could be in short supply.At the very least be informed. The effects of aging on your lung's ability to fight off infection are not tied to health. While yes, good health is always helpful, it doesn't at all preclude them from the natural risk of aging.Another morbid consideration is the fact that you can be a carrier up to 14 days without symptoms. Do your parents have friends and family in a similar age range? If they infect them it could wipe them out. The first cluster in the US was in a nursing home in Washington where 33 got sick. To date NINETEEN have died.I know people want to live their lives, but some prudence is needed. Taking 80 year olds to a high risk environment like Vegas is something you really need to reconsider."

"“ I know people want to live their lives, but some prudence is needed. Taking 80 year olds to a high risk environment like Vegas is something you really need to reconsider.”Agree, the lungs of an obese 30 year old are much more capable of withstanding a respiratory illness than a fit 80 barring no underlying condition. It would be challenging to find one pulmonologist that would argue the reverse. Tissue does degrade over time as cells replicate thousands of times over our lifetime."
"Testing like South Korea would likely bring the mortality rate from the virus down closer to a .6% rate. It would not likely change the number of deaths. If the implication is that SK is more effective at survival rates due to testing availability, that seems ignorant. SK has/had an explosion in symptomatic patients. They instituted draconian measures to arrest its spread. Personally if I had any health issue I would rather be treated here in the US than SK. Both drugs that are showing promise in treatment are made here in the US. At this point, selective testing seem prudent."

"I too have been questioning traveling, with their being very big gatherings and what not it seems harder to avoid. I am still planning on going on my trip in two weeks, but i am more scared to infect others. So i will follow instructions and disinfect rooms, airplane seats, etc. with recommended sprays. I will also wash my hands and clean my phone regularly. Everyone gives a different opinion on it. If the CDC puts travel recommendations between states then i will cancel.. I mean I think the panic the media is putting on it is really causing items to go scarce and putting Americans at risks of more problems then just the virus itself. Please people dont buy more than you can even go through in the year there is no point."
"""The U.S. spends more on healthcare than any high-income country, yet Americans have poor health outcomes and a worsening life expectancy when compared with other countries, according to a report from the The Commonwealth Fund.For the study, The Commonwealth Fund assessed the healthcare systems of 11 countries, including the U.S., based on these five areas: care process, access, administrative efficiency, equity and healthcare outcomes. Data was collected using international surveys of public and physicians, from 2015-2017.Here are the three things to know:1. The U.S. ranked last place among the 11 countries for health outcomes, equity and quality, despite having the highest per capita health earnings. 2. The U.S. also had the highest rate of mortality amenable to healthcare, meaning more Americans die from poor care quality than any other country involved in the study.3. Poor access to primary care in the U.S. has contributed to inadequate chronic disease prevention and management, delayed diagnoses and safety concerns, among other issues.""Edited: 11:37 am, March 11, 2020 "
"For those in high risk, consider the reality, vegas has a high percentage of international visitors, even casinos are starting to act adversely, like closing buffets to cancelling shows, sports events and conferences. They don't want to, but the writting is on the wall, this is a deadly virus with no cure and is unstoppable. Again if your in a high risk or not, keep up to date, watch the news on the CDC site, changing your plans is not easy but may save your life. Just my thoughts..."
"Mortality rate is inadequate measure of healthcare, survival rates are much more effective data set. We lead the world in survival rates. If you have cancer, heart issues, infectious diseases I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else. Culture including diet, lifestyle, how you count deaths all factor in. Blaming healthcare system is a fairly weak argument but this is a travel forum. I don’t find your comments nor Qdogpas comments informative, rational or relevant. You just seem ignorant and irrational."
"""Testing like South Korea would likely bring the mortality rate from the virus down closer to a .6% rate. It would not likely change the number of deaths.""If your low number is true it means it six times more deadly than the flu with no vaccine or treatment like Tamiflu available. That's the good news?"

"I just saw this on the news. We have a trip planned April 5 thru 10th. I have had a cold/flu? for about a week. No fever or other symptoms related to Covid, but I worry if we head off, if they don't cancel flights, and I still don't feel 100%..would they stop me from flying due to a cold?"
"""would they stop me from flying due to a cold?"" - Nobody will know you have a cold unless you tell them.13"
"The vaccine rate for the flu is the highest among the elders and they even have a special stronger vaccine for that population. So while the death rate for the average person may be the same as the flu, it will most likely be higher for the elderly. Plus the elderly could face the possible of getting both the flu and the virus and that double whammy could be the tipping point.

"FWIW, many area hospitals are checking temperature of people prior to entering the front door...I would not be surprised, though unlikely, that airlines do so at some airports"
My job just issued a travel ban. No business travel outside of state and personal travel must be submitted to HR and then a possible home isolation depending on where you are going. I am thinking that Vegas will be an isolation! I'm waiting to see if JetBlue does anything before I make a decision and cancel my May 10 trip though. But right now I don't think I'm going. The thought of being in the airport with thousands of people scares me.But I will definitely reschedule as soon as things clear up. I love Vegas!
"Vegasbride, you do have plenty of time to make a decision... I wouldn’t go in the next few weeks, but who knows what 6 weeks brings!"
"Vegasbride and othersAnother risk. Earlier I mentioned I just flew through S Korea from Bali. On the way, I met a very healthy 40 yr old man that will have to take two weeks vacation time to self isolate."
Agreed with Qdogpa. You can take a wait and see approach with trips that far out. Weather could hopefully curtail it. We also should finally have mass testing up and running.
"""We also should finally have mass testing up and running.""You do realize that under current operating policies that means mass quarantines, think millions & millions.Mild cases that are now unknown and don't cause a quarantine for everyone they came into contact will now require 100s to 1,000s of people to be quarantine."
"Yeah, that's why I'm not cancelling right now. Let's see what happens in the next few weeks, but after reading what zoobrew said... it's not looking too good!"
"""Testing like South Korea would likely bring the mortality rate from the virus down closer to a .6% rate. It would not likely change the number of deaths.""Yes it would. I have stated such. Its not minimizing the dangers of the virus... This is a legit troublesome bug. Easy to spread with no known antiviral or symptom modifying medication. My issue was/is with comparing the US testing to South Korea. South Korea has a very difficult time arresting its spread. I would not hold them up as a model of success right now. Some want to make it about US healthcare system or the administration. If you look at the countries that are struggling the most with the bug, many are ranked high on WHOs healthcare ranking system. Italy is number 2, France, Norway, Germany Switzerland etc. Constantly taking shots at the administration or healthcare system makes some feel good about themselves but not all that helpful on a travel forum."
"""Constantly taking shots at the administration or healthcare system makes some feel good about themselves but not all that helpful on a travel forum.""Yes, the current administration has just really been on top of this with the voice of reason coming from the very top. Well, I can dream can't I?"
"The windbag proclaimed weeks ago it was contained..His words, not mine ..Said it was NOT Inevitable to spread, his words, not mine..this differed from EVERY expert opinion, but he continued the drivel...At some point, one needs to be held accountable for his words and actions."
"I am impressed with NY's response so far. Transparent, proactive, and aggressive. I'm not always a fan of our Governor, but his response when asked about a restriction he imposed was perfect, ""It actually wasn't my call. I deferred to the doctors.

This being an election year my bet is all Federal Government resources are going to be throw at containing, treating and finally a vaccine for this virus.

"I don't really care about what news channel you watch. Nor the political party of those involved. Disease is not a political argument. I listen to the experts and monitor results. Not having testing ready despite months of warning is catastrophic. We still are a few days away from that and as a result we're now three weeks behind on everything. Considering the disease's progression we're likely looking at more than 10,000 untracked cases. This is going to make mitigation so much more difficult and on a scale many won't like. This is according to experts, and I could care less what political party they belong to."
First hand experience here in California during a crisis with current administration. I lived through the Campfire in Northern California FEMA did an exceptional job up here of getting aid to those in need. I've yet to hear a compliant of any kind about how the federal government has handled their business. On testing kits the Chinese government is to blame for the lack of mass production of corona virus testing kits.

"Mitigation and containment of this virus scenario supersedes politics, or it should. We're so damned divided as a citizenry that we lose sight of real facts and numbers ( that are now changing by the hour), and the reality that we're chasing a viral rabbit with a sizable head start on us ( specifically with the late testing problem). Yeah, I'm aware that only the elderly and medically compromised are most at risk( they always are) and, thus far, this thing is nowhere near as widespread / lethal ( number of actual deaths) as the multi-organism flu strains of this past winter in the US. Yet, the potential virulence / spread of COVID-19 in the US is unknown, regardless of one's title; that's partially because of unknown infection cases that will emerge from the now ongoing testing procedures and the isolation / containment cascade in response to that. A large number of confirmed cases exhibit little or no symptoms. In that regard, when the testing is in full-swing, nobody knows how widespread this will be. In all probability for the grand majority of us who enjoy travel to Vegas, the life/ travel disruption aspect of this disease may be the worst overriding consequence, even if some of us were to get the bug. On the bright side, great hotel rates, airfares, and multiple other travel perks are already emerging..for when this situation subsides. We could view this next couple months as an ideal time to plan a bargain-filled Vegas trip..while we simultaneously come in here and argue about whose fault it is. Lovely.China made mistakes, Trump made mistakes, Europe made mistakes, my Uncle Clarence and Aunt Eola made mistakes, I made mistakes..all behind us and unchangeable. How are we going to contribute to solving this problem, even though there is indeed a unique hysteria that will continue to be associated with the cause/ effects? C'mon summer? Go to Vegas now? Punt? Beat the ears off the orange-tinted guy some more? The increasing summer heat might yield the best odds (nature's way), along with common sense precaution measures ( including containment/ dreaded quarantine) and paid attention to those who truly know what's going on."
At this point I can't even keep up. It's gotten crazier by the hour.I just wanna say stay safe every single one of you.
Yup..
"Approx. Total of U.S. confirmed cases thus so far - 1281.Approx. total number of deaths thus far - 36 - The key majority of which occurred within a nursing home (or homes) facility located in Washington State.Considering the fact we're most fortunate to have multitudes of medical staff (doctors/specialists/hospitals) readily avail. within the U.S. who can provide us the necessary skills &/or treatments when ill; most of us (other than for the elderly &/or with weak immune systems) have very little cause for alarm &/or fear of the Coronovirus. Most folks who contract the virus, will most likely experience mild symptoms of a cold, some bodily chills, coughing, as well a mild fever or temperature. It's extremely unfortunate whereas, most countries deeply lack the necessary medical staff, the skills, &/or treatments to effectively treat their people of these viruses. Which helps to explain the extraordinary high levels of confirmed Coronovirus cases &/or deaths being experienced outside the U.S. More oftener people are so extremely poor whereas, they'll forgo medical care due to the high cost(s) of treatment within their country. Thus the extremely high mortality rates outside the U.S."

"""what’s your vitea (criterium vitea when you look it up on dictionary.com)""Curriculum Vitae?"
It’s altering my plans. Have my reservations for April but considerable doubts on how this progresses. Plan on hiking the Smokies in 2 weeks but my employer ( hospital) may have other plans so that may change as well.
"Curriculum vitae” IPad Siri change ... It was unnecessary comment anyway. I changed it to more relevant CommentEdited: 3:18 am, March 12, 2020 "

"Every year a buddy and I go to Vegas for March Madness to bet on the college basketball games. This would have been our 10th straight year for this. I made my travel plans months ago. Yesterday I cancelled my trip. My major concern was that I would become infected with no symptoms, then bring the virus home and infect loved ones. The risk is too big; it's not worth it."
I have reservations for Early May. Wondering if I should cancel then rebook to try to get a better price. My airline ticket which is non-refundable has already dropped by 80% Maybe its not too late to save on the Hotel?
"The timeline seems to be similar everywhere it hits. Well here in NY we are 2 weeks ahead of Vegas and we're shutting things down fast. My bar now can run at only 50% capacity and likely be shut down in total in a matter of days.So heads up, this will be Vegas in 1-2 weeks.Edited: 3:47 pm, March 12, 2020 "
