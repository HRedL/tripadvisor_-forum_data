"There are a hell of a lot of reviews gone on in the last week or so mentioning sickness and people being hospitalised, Almost all of the reviews are to do with sickness.I wonder when TC will stop offering this hotel as it has gone down hill.After our food poisoning fiasco in April we will not be returning but this hotel has the potential to be spectacular."
I’m booked up to go end of November.I’m seriously thinking of approaching my travel agent and asking to relocate or cancel.Watching the reviews lately it just looks like a game of Russian roulette with a barrel loaded full of bullets.Visited Cuba four times previously and seriously considering my options.
"I loved this hotel, Until we all got sick that it, Confirmed Salmonella and Thomas Cook AND the hotel accepted liability for it. It could be so amazing if they sorted out some very basic things like hygiene. Another thing we noticed while there is running out of food no chips for 13 days while we were there, no burgers on some days chicken etc.It would be amazing but its far from it, People obviously haven't stayed in top hotels if they rate this place. I've stayed in better 2 star hotels in India.Its a shame as it has the potential to be superb"
"I'm also booked for November. Been to Cuba 15 times, never had any issues. But really worried this time after reading all the latest reviews. Something is not right there."

"Does reviews sure are scary not a place I would like to be at .I know Cubans that go to resorts and they can,t believe how some of there own people leave there manners at home and are an embarrassment to the Cubans that go to the resorts so they can enjoy a nice vacation like the rest of the tourists .Jay you had no chips for 13 days well I talked to my Cuban friend this week and she has not been able to buy a potato were she lives since last year because there are none to be found .If there is potatos the resorts will get them first so tourists will get them and Cubans will be the last ones on the list ."
I ment those reviews ..
I must say as a long time lover of the Playa Pesquero I am shocked to read this latest batch of reviews. What on earth is going on at this resort?
"I couldn’t give a flying fig about no chips, I’m not concerned about anyone’s nationality.I just don’t want to be ill.I’ve never been ill anywhere on our holidays (Cuba three times, Gambia a few times, India & Northern Africa and most of the Mediterranean so we are used to taking sensible precautions)I don’t want fobbing off about too much sun or foreign foods and drinks.I’m at a loss what to do....."
"The reviews lately doesn't make it look too promising, I would keep checking, it might be going through a rough patch, which a lot of resorts do.....but if it doesn't get any better within the next month, I would change resorts."
"Thanks, I’m due to pay the remaining balance of Friday !I know our travel agent personally so before I part with any more money I’m going to see what she’s had to say....Maybe we should try the PCV....And just a little correction this is our fifth trip trip to Cuba and it certainly won’t be our last...Edited: 2 years ago "
"Saying that, sometimes if your in doubt, it would be best to change, than you can relax and not be worried that it's going to be ok......nothing worse than choosing a resort and stressed before you even get there."
"stewy w:When are you going? I would have thought that once the 'summer' season has ended, things should return to normal. ie; once the Cubans stop going to the resort and staffing levels return to normal."
Same thing was going on at PCV when we were there although not to the extent at Playa Pesquero (probably because there were very few guests as PCV as a lot transferred to PP. I know of one family of 6 that 5 had food poisoning (one adult and 4 children) and one ended up in hospital. Might be a Gavotia supply problem
"hola :) I read some of the reviews, loco and triste. That(sorry to say) is reality at times in Cuba. I have been before and going back! buen dia! :)"
Hi KenWe don’t fly until November 26th.I don’t mind who is at the hotel whilst we’re there. So long as it’s a happy bunch..Do staffing levels really get affected that much when it’s cuba peak holidays? I’d have thought numbers staying in general would have more of an effect?I did a quick search earlier and very surprised how prices have come down dramatically for the same date?I know your a big fan of PCV and also the PP... so welcome your veiws.I have until Saturday to decide and as much as I’ve been looking forward to experiencing the PP....oh dear now maybe similar issues at the PCV although reviews are not reflecting this at the minute I’m keep a close eye on things....
Stewey:This is the first time for over a year I have read reviews. I have never put great faith in them myself as I prefer to hear the views of the people who post on the forum. When I used to stay in resorts the reviews prior to my visiting were often very mixed but it didn't stop me from enjoying myself. Having said that I would never really recommend Cuba to anyone because the food is often quite poor compared to other parts of the world. It was the people and the culture that drew me to Cuba.In the summer months the hotels lay off cyclic staff and send others back to school. That used to be the case so I assume it's still the same. I really wouldn't know what to advise you to do but were it me I would just stick to the hotel I had booked.
We just got back.... my son (11years) was terribly ill for 4 days... on IV fluids.... and just about everyone i spoke to either had been ill or one of their party had been ill! It certainly wasnt just one or two people who had over done the sun! The Thomas Cook rep told me it was nothing to do with the restaurants and probably a virus we had brought with us..... NOT BUYING THAT...we cant ALL have brought a virus!!!! If you can change resort or hotel then CHANGE! There were some lovely moments during our stay in Cuba.... but seeing your kids so ill they cant move on IV fluids...and other people throwing up in restaurants and in the rooms next door....IT WAS HORRIBLE! Id NEVER go back!!!
"I agree with you mate, Chips i couldn't care less it was just the fact they didn't have any!There was a loads of locals there in April when we went, Some were alright but true majority of them very rude very pushy fighting for food etc it was at times crazy at meal times just watching them.We have been to some pretty poor places we know all the stpes to take we go to egypt twice per year as i dive, Been to India places like that but my god we were bad here!We got married my dad was that bad he didn't make it to my wedding unfortunately ours was confirmed Salmonella, I just dont know whats gone on here its changed. We will not be returning"
"Advise to anybody though who is there or just returned get straight to your GP on return and get a stool test, We thought it was just a bug until it come back with Salmonella.My girl was in hospital for 2 days worst experience of my life"
And this was back in April before the summer rush ...as I read it . Still going on now during the summer 5 months later . Doesn’t sound like a one off issue to me . Not good . Johnny C
"I still find it amusing that the hotels reply to everything is ""traveller's diarrhoea"""
"we are due to pay our balance in a week, as booked for last 2 weeks in Octoberhave never had any problem after 5 times at PP, but now super concerned re many reports of sickness!!talked with our travel agent who called Sunwing, said they have not heard anything and there is no travel advisory!! they do not go by tripadvisor reviews!if cant cancel will make sure we take Ducoral (sp?) and bring lots of meds"
Sunwing sit next to Thomas Cook reps so im quite sure they're fully aware...but will deny knowledge.... out rep tlld us it was a virus we had brought with us from Manchester and was unaware of others being poorly.....but loads of people filed reports about illness with them so they absolutely did know! Be careful....change resort if you can and if not i wish you luck.
"Stewy:Be interested to hear of your experience at the PCV. One thing for sure is that you will love the Japanese restaurant. Also the disco is superior to that of the PP plus they also have the cigar lounge, which was my favourite place to spend the evening after dinner."
"Not long now... 92 sleeps....We know it’s one of your favourite resorts Ken.Certain we have done the right thing, we will just put the PP back on the to do list - maybe try and have a walk round there in November.At the moment we’re considering also going away mid January....We will write a review anyway."
"We're due to arrive here on the 6th September.Goinb to speak to Thomas Cook today to see if we can move somewhere else (be that another hotel, resort, or country) We've been to Cuba before so lack of food etc not really an issue but as we're travelling with our 2 year old these reviews are terrifying.Matt"
"Hi MattWe can’t say we blame you, family safety must come first. suggest to explain the situation, we wanted to stay in the same area so picking the PCV was an easy choice.There was a £50 per person administration fee which initially seemed expensive but with current prices compared with Initial holiday cost (we booked back in April) we still saved £300.Good luck and please let us know how you get on."
There’s a story in the daily mail today about how a bride spent her wedding night on a drip after getting salmonella at Playa Pesquero.
dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6103729/Bride-2…
"All of these cases of sickness seem to have been going on for months. There were several reports before we went to PCV in July. I asked about this on the facebook group and was told there were no issues with the food, it was likely all just down to the usual change in climate, too much drink etc.Unfortunately our 6 year old contracted Salmonella (confirmed by samples on return home), while we were there and I know of quite a few others who had been unwell too. I have also seen mention of sickness in other hotels too, it's a worry for sure."
Hope your 6 year old is doing fine scary stories reading these posts and the lady that got married who also got sick just awful but as we know it's Cuba and nothing will change and the tour companies will continue to send tourists to these places .They always come up with the same stories when people get sick to them it's always the sun and to much drinking and the worst is some tourists will believe them like I have seen to often on this forum when people say they got sick in Cuba ...
"gat0:You are so right. Mind you I don't check other caribbean forums so I have no idea how Cuba shapes up as regards hygiene, health and safety against other tropical holiday destinations."
Bellagio i know a couple of years ago people from the Province of Quebec got sick in Jamaica at a resort and they stopped sending people till they got everything resolved and it also has happened in Mexico so I guess some places will take this more seriously then in Cuba .
"We have returned yesterday from this hotel yesterday. Every single person we talked to had been ill, including myself. I'm still I'll now. The food was shocking and the hygiene from the staff was none existent. For example at the stir fry station the cook had finished off a tray of prawns, he then washed the tray with his hand and no soap and then returned to his tongs to carry on cooking. We have been to Cuba and know what to expect with the food, no fresh vegetables whatsoever the 2 weeks we were there, everything was either frozen or tinned. Returning guests said it had never been that bad."
"Thanks gato, he is doing a lot better now thankfully! I know that a lot of the time people do get sick from the change in climate, drinking too much, different food etc but it seems sometimes like people can't accept that anyone can get genuinely ill. I had been asking before we went as I was concerned about the reports of illness at PCV at the time. I was assured that there were no issues with the food it was all just the usual travellers tummy - but obviously not!!"
"Well I called Thomas Cook the other day, they're now investigating the hotel and complaints and have been moving people out of the hotel due to the issues.We've managed to change our holiday as the only alternative hotel they offered didn't have a few things that PP had, so we're now off to cayo Santa Maria (melia las dunas) on Saturday instead or PP on Thursday.Found the people at TC in alterations to be extremely helpful and informative.Maty"
"Thanks for the update and pleased you got sorted.Hopefully issues are soon sorted and things return to normal. I’ve just taken a quick look and TC web site shows availability for next week - we are hoping to take a closer look in November and maybe visit in January.That’s unless we fall in love with PCV, Brisas is always a good fall back but we like to visit different places and make new memories."
I’m booked into the PCV at the end of October and now wanting to change resorts.. Were TC willing to let you change..?
"We didn’t have any problems changing hotel (we wanted the same area) but we know our travel agent personally, maybe the fact we were due to pay the balance helped our situation?We just explained our reasons, the Travel agent did have to go into ‘live chat’ on the PC and get authorisation but things went smoothly.We did have to pay an admin fee (I believe if the new hotel is more expensive this is waived) but this worked ok for us as the second hotel was actually cheaper at the time.Hope this helps and good luckEdited: 1 year ago "
Hi Matydo you know where Thomas Cook are moving people to?we are booked for October am hoping issues resolved by then!!!contacted our tour operator and they say no advisory yet
"This is certainly worrisome.. I wonder if this is employee/standards related/staffing issues/lack of training/ or is it related to time of year and infrastructure to support safe food handling techniques? This could be any or all. However to support tourism, Cuba will need to step this up to ensure public health/food handling issues and perhaps education on impact of a tourist being in a Caribbean country sun, water intake and impact of drinking in this location/ hand washing and having some hand sanitizer stations. If there are confirmed tests for salmonella that becomes another issue. Because someone is on an IV drip does not denote bacterial infection, it could be for example dehydration. This resort is getting a lot of attention."
"Hand sanitizer stations Mar . That’s hilarious .They can’t even replace burnt out light bulbs on walkways ,in half these resorts . Yes Cuba better step it up , soon Johnny C"
"@43 ...yes better health training is definitely key for many hotel chains...With so many health issues poster 36 is right about food handling....try teaching them cross-contamination...Unfortunately resort management is often busy with other topics (what could be more important?), so Food hygiene issues are happening in all resorts in the area, including the SOL SRLM."
@dreamliner4me Yes spoke to TC who were fine with us moving to a completely different resort as the hotel they offered (can't remember which now) didn't have one of the main things we wanted (young kids club so we can be adults for an hour or two!) Best place to call is Thomas Cook Alterations on ‭01733 224554‬They were extremely helpful and also have the details on their current investigation of the hotel and can provide further information.Hope that help you and anyone else out who's worried or concerned.Matt
Was going to PP Nov 27th. 40 min wait on the phone and 10 mins to change hotel. No way am I risking my wife and I going there. 1st call I made (dropped during call) the lady told me a team of TC guys went over last week and reviewed the place and passed with 96%. When the hotel know an inspection team are coming they will suddenly make everything better. I expect they hid the poor bed stricken people somewhere. Very sorry for them.Absolutely awful...
"we are booked to go here on the 17th september, and just been reading all the reviews the hotel seems to have took a nose dive , is there an up-date on the sicknessEdited: 1 year ago "
"We are considering going there after New Year.Kevindunn, please up-date us after your vacation."
"We were there in January, out of four of us that travelled three got a sickness bug which lasted about four days. The first few days we ate in the restaurants and out of the semi tepid trays, we put our illnes's down to this. After that we always had our food cooked fresh in front of us or used the restaurants which you could book, no problem after that. Ps, no medication was needed just plenty of water and rest."
"I would say tour groups,.....TC, etc should pull out of there, maybe PP will start to do something about this....it seems to be an on going epidemic....of health issuesBuffets are a magnet for germs, ....poor temperatures, cross contamination etc"
"We are going to playa pesquero on Thursday , what is the latest on thesickness"
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-619…
Whilst waiting for my flight home last Thursday I spoke to three separate couples who had stayed at the Playa Pesquero. All said they had had a fabulous time and knew nothing about these illnesses and had no knowledge of anyone being ill during their stay. Just saying.
That’s good to hear as we are going there in 5weeks
"I'll be interested to hear how you get on. I have been to Cuba nearly 60 times now and have had the odd illness there but nothing to speak of. Change of climate, different food and water can often cause minor problems."
Just wondering if this is still going on at PP or it's pretty much resolved? Booked for November but still have an option to change the resort.
I've reached out to some friends who live in the area to find out if they are aware of the goings on. They told me that he knew of some problems a few months back but that normalcy has returned and there is no word of any further problems.
"Hopefully resolved? I dont think id go back after what happend to my family especially my little ones i just couldn't risk it again but if they get everything right then this has the potential to be amazing! I wonder what the cause was, Wondering if it was just the way the hotel stored and cooked meats or if it was contaminated before it got to the hotel?"
StewyMyself and Carmen spent 3 week's at PCV in July 2015.We had a great holiday then.Hopefully you will love it in November.  PAULM
"Cheers Paul, we’re looking forward to some Cuban sunshine and hospitality.We’ve been watching reviews with interest but still taking things with a pinch of salt.The last few years we’ve been swapping and changing our destinations - keeping things different but still love returning to Cuba.We hope you and Carmen are well, hope Carmen wasn’t too put off with the Scottish weather !"
I spoke to people whilst waiting for my flight home on Tuesday who had been staying at both the PCV and the PP and no one knew of anyone that had been sick.
Hopefully all will be OK. Look forward to hearing all about it on your return.
I only just returned on Tuesday flying back into Gatwick.. Prices a little on the high side for me to return before Christmas so January seems to be my best bet.
Oh Gatwick!Not the easiest of places to get to from our neck of the woods - especially trying to tie in flight times with work - we’re flying out of there 14th January but going East not West.We almost booked for PP but timing was just too close to the November trip.But we will holiday there at some point ✈️
