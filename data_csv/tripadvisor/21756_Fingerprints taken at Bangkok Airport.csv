Hi Was surprised to see this happening on our recent trip.Are other Airports doing it too?
"Yes they do it at Don Muang as well, not sure about other international airports but I would expect so. It has been in for about 1 year now, nothing to do with Coronavirus."
"Phuket International Airport too.Right 4 fingers, left 4 fingers then two thumbs.Edited: 7:37 am, February 29, 2020 "
"Last time I only did 4 fingers left hand, they must know me by now as I have done many times.About time they got rid of those forms, Malaysia did it about 10 years ago.Edited: 7:39 am, February 29, 2020 "
"""Are other Airports doing it too?""Yep, plenty of airports do it. Not sure what's so surprising about it tbh.Malaysia brought it in about 5 or 7 years ago, with Thailand not that long after Malaysia."
"Yep, quite common these days."
"Japan has used thumb print monitoring at immigration for 10 years or more. One amusing story I read concerned a Chinese woman who had her thumb prints surgically swopped over in order to enter Japan illegally after having been previously deported.news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8400222.stmEdited: 8:27 am, February 29, 2020 "
"yes, we did it last time..."
"""nothing to do with Coronavirus.""True but interesting to see if they provide hand sanitizer as a result of coronavirus."
Started doing it at Suvarnabhumi last year April or May I think. My recent trip they did not asked for finger prints coming in but when I left 4 days ago they asked for four fingers on right hand.
"They do it at Ko Samui airport too.Pretty fast system. The system recognizes frequent travelers usually after scanning the right fingers, changes to your own language and ends the scanning."
"""Are other Airports doing it too?""In certain cases Heathrow for one."
Another great fomite for COVUID-19!All travelers get a chance to spin the wheel!
Never had it done at Heathrow.
Great idea !Hopefully UK will introduce finger print scanning now we have left / are leaving the rotten EU.Need to learn from Thailand and stamp people both in and out of country so as to know exactly who is in the country.Hopefully after Brexit UK will be able to introduce this without interfetence from the EU.
Cant they just do that from your passport?
#14 So UK wants to learn from Thailand?5555Good luck with that and good luck with Boris. So happy I am not British.
"""Cant they just do that from your passport""Britain abandoned exit checks and believe it or not the method used to determine how many people were leaving the country was statistics.On an individual level Britain has no idea who has or hasn't left the country."
"@#14""Great idea !Hopefully UK will introduce finger print scanning now we have left / are leaving the rotten EU.Need to learn from Thailand and stamp people both in and out of country so as to know exactly who is in the country.Hopefully after Brexit UK will be able to introduce this without interfetence from the EU.""It may be new to you that p.ports get scanned on arrival by immigration. Your p.port is put on a scanner. No need to do much more. EU doesn't care how you register arrivals/departures as UK doesn't belong to Schengen."
"""It may be new to you that p.ports get scanned on arrival by immigration.""Yes, correct, but NOT on leaving the country, so UK has no idea who is in the country at anytime !"
">>Britain abandoned exit checks and believe it or not the method used to determine how many people were leaving the country was statistics.On an individual level Britain has no idea who has or hasn't left the country.===================================Actually, airlines hand over passport information of all passengers to the Border Force for each flight leaving the UK (this is the point of API - Advanced Passenger Information). So the statistics are based on some measure of reality from the airline's manifests and records. Why employ Immigration officers to stamp everyone in and out when you can make the airlines do that job for you?!"
Cambodia has done this for agesI have always wondered how many people they apprehend as a results of these printsIn an ideal world the UK might well follow suit but can you imagine the fuss the civil liberties brigade would make
Why? Do you see this as a problem?
"""Cambodia has done this for ages""Yes, I have been finger print scanned entering Cambodia for years. Interesting that Malaysia and Thailand have followed suit. Must be a good reason for this ?I am sure Priti Patel would like to introduce FP scanning in UK but reading current news she may not be Home Secretary for much longer :) 555"
"Malaysia has done it for years also, I have not been there for at least 8 years and they were doing it then and no landing forms either. I'm reading it started in 2011."
"@ Ray ""Never had it done at Heathrow."" no Ray you will not have (I am not sure if Thai citizens have it done at BKK either), but you will notice I said ""in certain cases"". At the moment it is only non EU citizens living in the UK with a biometric residence ID card who ""may be asked"" for their fingerprints.."
"""Hopefully after Brexit UK will be able to introduce this without interfetence from the EU.""What did exit checks have to do with the EU. Do you seriously think that the cheapskate UK Government would re-introduce exit checks with all the cost involved. Hell would freeze over before the Government spent money on exit checks."
Malaysia has been using this finger print system since 1/6/2011 to prevent illegal immigrants coming in using fake papers.
Even Banjul airport in The Gambia in West Africa is taking fingerprints.
"Singapore takes fingerprints, and if I recall so does China? (Shanghai at least? I do forget).The EU never dictated that the UK shouldn't do border checks, because the UK had the liberty to decline the Schengen treaty. I had to go through passport control going from/to the UK to Italy, my friend going to/from Spain to Italy did not. It's not my fault that the British border staff pretends to scan your passport but has no idea when you've been in or out. Yes, touched a nerve. There is a lot more to how the UK could have dealt with checking their borders but decided not to and then blame it on others, but this is not the place.Edited: 8:41 am, March 02, 2020 "
Post #29.No not the place. Blame game? Who is blaming who about what?
"Not all airports do it. If a traveller has nothing to hide, he/she should be OK!Edited: 2:27 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"""Not all airports do it. If a traveller has nothing to hide, he/she should be OK!""Although it is wise to wash you hands afterwards. The Thai divers license test includes a test for peripheral vision. One has to lay their chin on a metal pad and spots little lights to their side. I always take a handkerchief to place on the pad. Not only do I avoid direct contact with a well contaminated fomite, it also allows me to set my head back just a bit further!"
"""Although it is wise to wash you hands afterwards.""I do a quick wipe off of the screen before using the gadget then use a hand sanitizer afterwards."
#32 how many times have you had to take the driving test

#36 care to explain as your post makes no sense
"What money grabbing idiots are you talking about exactly, Darren?"
"""#32 how many times have you had to take the driving test""I have applied for a Thai DL 3 times. First time is a one year. Subsequent times have been 5 year renewals. I have never taken a ""driving"" test. With my Stateside DL, and an IDP, both with motorcycle endorsements, I only needed the ""skills"" tests. Nothing behind the wheel.The first time there was a very simple written test. Now they just run a movie while everyone plays on their phones."
Yes. It has been that way for a while now in Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok. A lot of other airports do it too.
Sorry to be so off topic but post 39 explains the high death rate on Thai roads!
"""Sorry to be so off topic but post 39 explains the high death rate on Thai roads!""Had I not had an valid DL, and and IDP, I would have had to take a road test. Thais, getting their first DL, need to take a road test.The high death rate is from stupidity, drinking, no seat belts or helmets. No test is going to overcome that."
