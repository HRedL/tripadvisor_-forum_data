Are there bars that allow smoking to the general public in Caleta.
You are not allowed to smoke in any bar inside.Outside is ok if the bar allows it and most do.
"Initially in Spain the ban was only paid lip service to. Then it was enforced and there was an entertaining case live on Andalucia Directo where a big fat and rich bar owner somewhere down south, maybe Marbella, said he would defy it.The Policia Nacional broke down his barricade, threw out his regulars, closed the bar and fined him 100,000 euros. I understand he then complied with the law."
"The reason I am asking the question about smoking bars is I was hoping someone would come back with a specific bar name as I was in this bar last week and the people drinking in the bar were smoking, I asked the bar staff who were British why people were smoking and they said that the bar had a special dispensation to allow smoking????. There were children in with their families who I hasten to say weren't smoking, the bar is part of a holiday complex.Any thoughts please."
"Hi Willie H,was it Zanzibar? We were in there a few years ago and I was amazed when a couple who were playing pool, lit up and kept leaving their cigarettes burning in an ashtray!! Then other people started smoking and we got up and walked out. Never been back in there since."
"There is no dispensation that I know of , he’s just making an excuse , I agree with the smoking ban , even though I’m a smoker , don’t like the idea of smoking in front of people , who may be eating , and particularly in front of youngsters A lot have awnings , or a covered area where you can eat or drink , even then I try no to smoke unless nice and open and no kids about"
"Good guess Gill G, yes it was Zanzibar, couldn't believe what I was seeing, total disregard of the law, they have covered areas outside with televisions so I have no idea why people would flout the law. I am a non smoker but in no way am I anti smoking, laws are there for a reason. I am moving to Fuerteventura permanently in August and no way will I set foot in Zanzibar again....Thanks H9467jKianh for you sensible comments, I wish others were like that...."
"Don't quote me Willie H but I know this subject was brought up before (don't know which forum). One poster commented that they had heard that the Chief of Police drank in there and, as a smoker himself he basically turns a blind eye! As I say I've no idea if this is true, just something I read. Maybe you'll find out the real reason they get away with it when you live there. Good luck with the move."
"Might do some detective work on that one, pardon the pun... I put a review up on Tripadvisor about it last week but it is still pending!!!!! Thanks for the good luck message Gill G....."
"There are just a very few bars that continue to flout the law. Here in Corralejo we had one that is now closed (for different reasons) and I've heard a recent complaint about a bar I frequent sometimes. I haven't witnessed any smoking in there myself so I shan't name the bar. But it really is rare and should be reported, with photos if possible. Whatever your views, it is illegal."
"Sheila, I don't want to name names either but is it one of the Irish bars? Just seem to remember being quite surprised when someone lit up when we were there one night."
"No, it wasn't, Gill. Goodness, I do hope it isn't an epidemic of civil disobedience!"
"I've heard that the Zanzibar at Fuerteventura Beach Club, in Caleta has always flouted the non-smoking law, for the reason mentioned in Post 7. I don't know if it is true as I wouldn't go there."
