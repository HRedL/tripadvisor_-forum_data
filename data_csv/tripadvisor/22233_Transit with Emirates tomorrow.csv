Flying from Thailand to UK via Dubai was with Emirates. Has anyone had any problems when stopping for short while in terminal 3???
"Nope, even 90mins connection is fine, but if your 1st flight arrives a bit late, then Emirates will have staff waiting upon arrival at the gate, to fast track you through to your next flight"
Thank you
Are you Really going
Really going where? I’m trying to get home to UK. After 4 flight changes over the last week I am hoping this one works.
"they are cancelling into bangkok and phuket until further notice from the 23rd - good luck , hope you get home, id turn up and see, if they cant fly you then insist they get you on someone that can."
Dubai Airports (DXB & DWC) will be closing for two weeks as of midnight March 25th for all inbound and outbound flights including transit https://www.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus-out…
so what are the options open to them who cant get back from dubai - anyone know..
"options are:1- wait for after the 2 weeks period are over. However, authorities said that the period will be reassessed and could be extended2- Go by land to a neighboring country and try to travel from there provided the airports in that country are open. A stay extension will be given for visitors who could not leave the UAE due to flight cancellations and airport closures https://www.khaleejtimes.com/news/general/ua…"
"Lovedogs,It seems that folks stuck half way home are up a certain creek without the proverbial paddle.Very worrying times we live in at the moment.Kind regards"
"Update, I was lucky my flight into Dubai and back out on Sunday night, early Monday morning went ahead. It was a very anxious time, especially when we were delayed with the flight from Dubai......no one telling us anything and no Emirates staff to be seen! 3 hours delay but got home. I hope others are as lucky as we were."
Glad you made it before the airport closure.
Yes it was scary how quickly everything was changing.
Many thanks for posting back with your good news.
