"In early August, I am currently scheduled to go to Mexico City via Amsterdam due to the 3 hour layover. My concern is, especially on the way back, is the quarantine situation. I am fully aware I would need to isolate in the UK but because the first city I land back in is Amsterdam, do I have to stay there?Anyone done a trip to a non safe country via a Schengen country?"
"If you are in the transit area in Amsterdam, you do not enter the Schengen area.So your first country you enter is really the UK."
There are no coronavirus related restrictions for nonSchengen to nonSchengen transit.
