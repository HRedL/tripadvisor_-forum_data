"I’ve been reading about all the seaweed all over the coast there for months. Your thoughts about whether it will likely clear up by mid October or not or impossible to know. Really want to go to Secrets Maroma beach for our 25th anniversary, but strongly reconsidering. Thank you for your thoughts."
It's hard to call from week to week let alone forecasting it 5 months from now.Just my opinion mind you.
"Well not just yours. :-) As with other aspects of beach conditions, there is a lot of variation over time and from one specific location to the next."
No one has a crystal ball
That’s fairly obvious that no one has a crystal ball! What I’m asking is it seasonal or completely random. Is October any different that June or it all the same?
"I don't think there has been enough history to make a prediction.In 2015, when it was the worst I've seen, it eventually abated, and I don't recall that it was a problem at any time in 2016.The seaweed returned in Feb/March 2017, and again abated towards the end of the year when there was very little to none. When it did appear at the end of 2017, it was usually a thin strip, and easily raked up. On most days, the beaches were clean.In late February this year, seaweed returned in significant amounts. We have had a few occasional clean beach weeks when the beaches had been cleaned up, and no new seaweed washing ashore, but it has always returned. I suspect it will abate as it did last year, but I don't know when (I'm not even sure if it will abate).I know there was little to none last October, as well as Oct 2016, but can't recall Oct 2015.Edited: 2 years ago "
"This is just about all that can be said with certainty: If you want to be reassured that seaweed will not be a problem during your vacation, you are going to have to travel somewhere else. If you are determined to travel to the Caribbean area of Mexico, Western facing beaches on Cozumel and Playa Norte on Isla Mujeres are safer bets. If you just want to go to Mexico, the Pacific coast is an even safer bet."
"""I don't think there has been enough history to make a prediction.""^^^This.I've been on these forums for a looong time (13 years) and am not aware of any seagrass issue prior to 2015. Although I've read speculations that mention rising ocean temperatures and other factors, I don't believe any definitive cause of this problem has been identified. So, without a history and without any real understanding of why this is happening in the first place, it's impossible to predict future conditions.There is a website that provides ""forecasts"" about eight days out based upon satellite imagery that tracks the ""mats"" of seagrass in the ocean - but even they have a disclaimer stating that their forecasts are based upon current trends and theories. seas-forecast.com/Page%20Forecast/Yucatan.jpg"
"Hard to say, but I have been to the area in June, October, November, December and October had the worst weather and seaweed. Would not go back at that time."
"I live in the area and the problem is widespread all over this part of the Caribbean. With massive amounts like this, one would have to be a fool to expect this to go away anytime soon. I guess the effects of global warming and relentless pollution have reached us. As for your vacation: if it's beach you're looking for, avoid this area!"
""" I guess the effects of global warming and relentless pollution have reached us. As for your vacation: if it's beach you're looking for, avoid this area!""Spot on!! As many experts say, who know much more about it than most of us, this may be the "" new normal"".P.S. Sargassum and sea grass are two different things."
"I wonder that no americans have any idea that the whole seaweed problem was caused by deepwater horizon incident. BP obviously does all it can so that they are not pointed at.. otherwise they would go bankrupt by lawsuits from travel industry - they destroyed their business. During tue incident, there was so much oil (=nutrients) released to the sea, that i will take many decades to settle down."
Nonsense.
"Well Jan; it's a well known fact that our Mother Earth has this thing they call the Sarsassum Sea. You might want to google that before theorizing on the BP oil disaster; which was a terrible thing and still impacts the Gulf today. You may also want to research the Amazon mouth where other problems occur that are also part of the problem and do this before blaming the problem we all face here with the sargassum on something totally irrelevant.You may even want to visit our piece of paradise. We have been eating seafood from the Caribbean and the Southern Gulf waters before, during, and after the BP spill. Delicious. The same can not be said for my friends in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for sure. There are still gobs of oil that wash up on the beaches in Florida. After the hurricane we are bound to see more. My intention is not to tear your comment apart but to try and keep info that is more realistic.BTW Welcome to the the forum!"
The sargassum currently affecting the area and so many other areas if not coming from the Sargasso Sea. This particular sub species called s.natans viii is coming from South America and even off the coast of Africa. It is well documented. Saw a photo just today from a beach in Tulum and it was awful....piles and piles of it.
Sargasso Sea was a starting point for research versus the theory of the BP oil spill.
