"Hi,Are people in Antigua concerned about Chikungunya virus? How bad is the situation there right now? Those of you who traveled to the Verandah, are there a lot of mosquitoes on the resort premises? Thanks."
"There have been a couple of cases reported. I wouldn't say people are particularly worried - certainly no more than they are about dengue. There are mosquitoes around, but the resorts fog effectively, and it's pretty easy to protect yourself with adequate insect repellents and sensible precautions.See here: tripadvisor.co.uk/Travel-g147242-c3273/Antig…"
Thanks a lot!
"It's not a major problem.There have been a few isolated incidences, but these are few and far between. There are 80,000+ people who LIVE in Antigua and only a handful of cases. I'm not saying that contracting the Chikungunya virus is impossible, but right now I would say it is extremely unlikely. However, take precautions - for example use bug spray, and try to stay indoors at least a half hour on either side of dusk and dawn."
"never heard of it! Hotels do a good job of fogging to minimise mosquitos, and as usual you should just spray some repellent in forest areas or on beach after sunset (sand flies). I didn't get one bite this time in April. I bought ""OFF"" from my hotel shop which is much better than the stuff you get at home."
"That's great, Salfifi. Thank you so much for posting your answer. I feel better knowing that they are doing their best in keeping mosquito population under control."
"Apparently the mosquitos carrying chikungunya commonly bite during the day, so you might want to take precautions at all times. Especially if you are away from the beach and into the more wooded areas."
Canada has upgraded their travel advisory to level 2 from 1 so its getting worse. We were there in April and had not heard about it but we were right beside Sandals resort who fogged at dusk every evening. We have booked 5 weeks next year as its beautiful there but will monitor the situation. Even where we were the mosquitoes were terrible!!
"We ended up going to The Verandah and no problems with mosquitoes there either due to the fact that it gets pretty windy there or maybe because the resort management runs an effective mosquito control. Not sure. But on the way back, we saw them at the airport terminal."
"The Minister of Health in Antigua today expressed concern that ""too many Antiguans have gotten chikungunya"". Don't know how many is too many but methinks I'll be a bit more careful than usual - long sleeves, long pants and a splash of OFF."
"What is the current situation please? I have just cancelled a holiday in the French West Indies where ChikV is at epidemic proportions. Unless public health control measures are very effective, it is likely to spread across the Carribean."
"Not sure if you're asking a question or trying to make a statement?There is some Chikungunya on Antigua - as there is on most of the islands, but I think the attitude of those living there and those visiting are very different. Like Dengue, it's perceived as something that happens, and every effort is made to stop mosquitos breeding (keeping the place dry), with fogging taking place in vulnerable areas. Most resorts fog as well.As said before, taking sensible personal precautions, both day and night, to avoid being bitten is the best and most effective thing you can do."
"I returned from Antigua at the end of August and went down with chikungunya 3 days later. Felt very ill, high fever, joint pain and incredibly itchy rash. 3 weeks later the main symptoms have subsided and I'm back at work but I'm still suffering from joint pain in my hands and wrists. I used DEET every day/evening and thought I had taken all sensible precautions. I had a lovely holiday but this illness has certainly put me off travelling to the tropics again."
What bad luck Reigatemum :(Hope you start to feel much better soon.
"Thanks mizgeorge - relieved that the rest of my family haven't had it! Have been feeling a bit sorry for myself and I'm impatient to get back to full health, hopefully it won't be too much longer."
Headed to Antigua in December. Is this ChikV that serious? or just an illness?We will be staying close to the English Harbour at a friends place. She's been down there for 5 years now and has never contracted the virus. Is there anything else we could do to protect ourselves while we are down there other than bug spray? We have Bug Spray issued by the Canadian Army.
"Hi Jay; I had never heard of the virus and was certainly not alerted to it whilst we were there. I think I must have been bitten whilst on a day out. We hired a car and explored the island and visited St John's on a couple of occasions. I think it was just bad luck. In terms of the seriousness, I was back at work within a week, however, I am still suffering from constant joint pain in my hands, wrists, feet, ankles which to date have has not improved at all. I'm taking ibuprofen as it's painful to walk,my doctor has said that most people recover in a few months but for some it can go on for over a year! It's obviously not something they are going to shout about as it would be bad for tourism. If you are at a resort with regular fogging and intend to stay there I'd imagine the risk would be very low."
Thank you for sharing your story Reigatemum as I also never heard of it . We will be staying at a resort in March and will rethink our plans regarding exploring the island. Wishing you all the best and a speedy recovery.
"We stayed at Jolly beach beginning of september, 3 of us (females) where literally eaten alive covered from head to foot in bad bites even with use of OFF and local spray. Although very itchy and annoying no symptoms of virus and would have had it by now. Im NOT saying it isn't an issue but we didnt get the virus."
I just got returned from Antigua 3 days ago. I was very concerned about chick V being pregnant and didn't take any chances. Usually I'm not as diligent and come back covered in Mosquitos/sand flea/no see um bites. This time I reapplied spray at least twice a day and I came home with only 5 bites!! Such a big difference from past trips.
Any news or reports re the Galley Bay resort?
We are also staying at G.B. and have read some reviews that the mosquito's are horrendous with only open air dining but never any mention of the virus. Our dates are end of Feb. into early March does time of year affect at all ? We will definitely have the bug spray packed and trying to focus on the reviews by so many positive repeater clients.
My parents have just come back to England from antigua after being there for 3 months. My dad has been confirmed as having the virus which has left him in a lot of pain in his joints. Our local doctor had never heard of it but went out of her way to research it and he has now been prescribed an anti inflammatory drug.Edited: 5 years ago 
"@DGK we have stayed at a resort right beside GB, and the Mosquitos were terrible, but it was in December which is rainier than Jan-Mar. So I think at least the time of year will be in your favour. We were also in Antigu just before Easter this year, on the heels of. Dry spell, nd the mosquito conditions were better where we stayed on the west coast."
"Thanks for sharing MelvaOntario, we will have the spray handy and hope they won't be too awful."
I'm still suffering the affects after almost 6 weeks since initial infection. The joint pain and fatigue is hampering my day to day life. I can't walk far due to pains in feet and I am doing the minimum at home/work. Speaking with the doctor I was referred to in London yesterday; he indicated that my current symptoms could continue for a number of months. Do take extra care to limit bites - this is a nasty virus!!
"Wow, Reigatamum, that sounds very difficult for you, am so sorry. I do not like the toxicity in chemical sprays so I am going to ask my naturopath for a natural one. If I hear of a good one, I will share. We usually used Off, but I did not find it terribly effective (on top of the nasty chemicals).I do wish you a speedier than predicted recovery!"
hi DTG0101i have sent you private message would it be possible to answer me getting very worried about accommodation or if you have phone no for steve really need to contact himamanda
"We always use ""Incognito"" insect repellent which is natural and citronella based. We find that it works as well as some of the chemical sprays and have successfully used it to prevent bites when staying at Cocobay. You can get it quite easily in the UK on Amazon and also at Holland and Barrett. Not sure if it available elsewhere....."
"Health Canada ( ha..ha..ha...what a joke of a name) is banning citronella based products here in Canada. For anyone renting in Jolly Harbour, I received an answer to an email inquiry from Typically Tropical that no guests renting a villa through them have reported the virus."
"If you don't mind making your own effective repellant spray, this essential oil product works great as we've tested it a lot in the Caribbean:amazon.com/gp/…What you do is mix drops of this oil with witch hazel to make a nice potent spray. What makes it work well is that it has a mix of oils and not just citronella. The combination of oils is the key to tricking the mosquitoes not to land on you.With a natural spray like this the most important thing to do is put it on multiple times during the day. (It.s best to apply it more often than a deet spray.) Another good natural technique (that is non toxic) for dealing with the mosquitoes is to wear the essential oil infused bug bands. They are especially good at night. You can wear them on your wrists and ankles and they work quite well. Banning citronella as a natural tool for fighting mosquitoes is stupid; it's just really bad science."
"@rRichk, health Canada has banned citronella? Whatever for? Always thought it was one of the best natural remedies...go.figure...joke indeed.Will look I to the essential oil. Don't think Incognito is available in Canada."
Citronella was band because the safety studies have not been done and it contains a suspected human carcinogen. Here is a link cbc.ca/news/business/health-canada-pulling-l…The article does say spray doesn't mention candles etc.
"If you are really wanting to protect yourself the only really effective deterrent is an insecticide containing at least 50% DEET. Don't mess around with herbal remedies, please, it is your health that you should be worrying about!"
"The percentage of DEET does not affect it's efficacy. The lower strength (5%, 10% etc) only means you have to apply it more often. Always read the label before use. I agree with Amanda, don't play with your health. Use a product to protect yourself that has been tested and proven to work and also to be relatively safe if used as directed."
Hi - is the chik v still on the increase or are you finding it on the decrease? Any issues at Galley Bay? Thanks!
"Hello,Getting a little worried about this virus! Arriving on Saturday and staying at the verandah. Is it bad at this resort? Do we need to be careful about being on the sand? Any info would be great! Thank you. Btw how's the weather been???"
Amanda - I agree that you should be concerned with your health but perhaps you should look into the side effects of using Deet. Especially such a high amount as 50%!! I'd prefer to take my chances with a more natural product. I've tried and tested Mozi-Q which is a homeopathic remedy and has been effective against mosquitoes in northern Ontario when using it. This in combination with other natural products is my preferred way but everyone needs to gather the facts and make their own decision.
"@wspr it's hard to tell whether its on the increase or decrease because Antiguan labs don't do the testing, which means a long and expensive process to send to an overseas lab to confirm whether you have it or not. As a result, testing for most cases is no longer done and the disease can quite easily be misdiagnosed.@Patricia Most resorts do fogging to reduce the mosquito population, so I doubt it would be a major problem. My advice to you would be to be inside in the hour before and just after dawn and dusk, or to cover up well AND use repellent during this time.Since the passage of Gonzalo on Monday, it's been extremely sunny and dry. In fact, even with the passage of the storm, we are well below the average rainfall for October."
Rick do you have ChickV in Northern Ontario?
"Amanda I live in Northern Ontario and no we don't, we don't have the right mosquitoes. It is in the southern US though.Edited: 5 years ago "
No Chik V here but lots of mosquitoes in parts of Ontario that people have summer cottages.
Thank you :)))
"I'm bringing something like 98% DEET - it's worth the risk for a short while. I have RA & I certainly do not want my health compounded by more joint pain/muscle weakness for a year or more! I used to like Mosquito Milk but my husband thought it useless. From what I hear it's the daytime type mosquitoes that you need to worry about, not the nuisance-type sand fleas.Hope scientists find a remedy soon, this has got to hurt the tourist industry - like it needed something else!"
"Hi everyone, We're coming out soon (not to a resort which might be spraying) - south near Curtain Bluff hotel I know the weather has been pretty wet recently, so I'd welcome any updates on what its like at the moment? My husband is panicking as he always get bitten alive by midges or any other flying insect!Plus, do Epicurean sell good mosquito repellants that plug in? As well as wearing DEET, I thought this might help!"
I like the mosquito coils that you burn; we put them under the table outside or inside in the bedrooms. Some people don't like the smell but I love it because I associate it with my mother-in-law's in St. Maarten. I will bring some from home & expect to be able to buy replacements @ the grocery store. Traveltalkonline St. Maarten site is also talking about this problem & people have a lot of recommendations there. Some are recommending natural products but I like DEET & will look for Mosquito Milk also; nothing is quaranteed to work tho.!
is there a good or a bad time of year for the mosquitos ? we are leaving for Orlando on the 5th Dec and then we go to Jolly Beach Antigua on 13th December.
Due to travel to jolly beach on 18th can anyone tell me what the situation is ref this chikunguya virus at this area pleaseEdited: 5 years ago 
Think it's got a bit out of control! We are still booked for our 16 th visit to Antigua for 10 weeks.
"The situation is no worse than anywhere else on the island - and all the resorts are making a huge effort to contain any problems with regular fogging and trying to keep standing water to a minimum.You can help yourself the most by using really effective mosquito repellent, ideally a DEET based version, during the day as well as after dark at the moment. Avoid any highly scented toiletries and perfumes and consider covering when practical. Mosquito coils/mats will also help. These, and the local OFF repellent (which works well for most people) are available at the Epicurean supermarket right next door at Jolly Harbour. Antigua has not been as hard hit as many other islands, perhaps because it's relatively arid, but you do still need to take care."

Have just returned from a holiday of 4 weeks in Antigua. It has been very wet recently and there seem to be more mosquitoes than previous years. We know many locals there and there does not seem to have been many cases of Chikungunya as yet. Of more immediate concern has been West Nile virus which is becoming widespread. Locals reported that they had been affected and in many cases had not fully recovered after several months still suffering joint pains.Little is being said publically as there could be devastating implications for tourism there. Most resorts carry out fogging to control insects but this can never be fully effective and it only takes one bite from an infected mosquito to get either of the illnesses. It is a definite very important risk to be considered especially for retired and elderly visitors where the symptoms and outcome can be far more serious.Deet based repellents should be used at all times and re applied more frequently than recommended and also to clothes. From dusk onwards trousers should be warn and upper garments with long sleeves. It may not make you look so cool but is vital to protect your well being.We used higher strength 'Off' spray which seemed very effective though we still had the odd bite. Indoors we sprayed on leaving each day in case the odd mosquito had been missed and we ensured doors and windows were only open if screens were across them. All a bit of a pain but being in the elderly category it was worth it to avoid a potentially debilitating and possibly life threatening illness
"I just talked to my sister-in-law just returning from St. Maarten; one of her friends there is recovering from the disease - it was terrible. She couldn't work & subsequently lost her job, she lost a lot of weight, had a relapse and is just devastated. I would not cancel my vacation & am spending 5 weeks between Antigua and St. Maarten, but I truly am getting more and more concerned. We will be staying @ Jolly Harbour and I think we will be personally in charge of any fogging. In St. Maarten we will be staying @ a private home. They have had a lot of flooding. There has been tremendous rainfall since the last hurricane and it looks like Grand Case is under water from the pictures I've seen. We have family there. I am so looking forward to a cure or scientific breakthrough to quell the spread of this illness."
"so..in the ""4 weeks you were there,you had no problems?"
No we are fine but as said previously we were careful. Just try to prevent being bitten.
Anyone been to the Grand Pineapple Resort that can report on the mosquito population there. Do they fog? Do you know of anyone who has been there and has gotten Chik-V? We've booked for Jan 3/15 and we are concerned. Thanks.
"GZerbie, I have been to GPB twice and they fog regularly. In fact, we did not get any mosquito bites at all in the resort.We do need to be aware of Chik V and West Nile, but I have been on holiday to Antigua several times with sand fly and mosquito bites, but with just the usual annoying bites. I would not be afraid to visit. The deet spray you can buy over there ""Off"" is very effective, and I purchase that every time instead of bringing anything over from the UK.I have just returned from twelve days in Antigua. We had heavy rain during second day and then on the day we left. Inbetween the usual lovely weather with maybe the occasional light shower lasting minutes. In fact, the locals are so grateful for the rain as they say they have had a drought.The incidents posted are in the minority. I really feel sorry for those who have suffered, but please do not be put off.I have just had a wonderful holiday and can't wait to return."
"Thank you for your message. We have ""Off"" here in Canada so we will be taking it with us as we do on all our trips. We've been to many Caribbean Islands and wanted to visit Antigua as we have never been. We have heard nothing but good things about it and the GPB so we wanted to get there before they change it for a Beaches. All the islands seem to have the Chik V now and we also have the West Nile here in Canada. My wife was a little bit concerned, I don't know why because I'm the one who usually gets bitten not her. Anyway prevention and being prepared is the best medicine and we will still be going. Thank you again."
Just returned from Jolly Beach resort mosquitoes and sand flies everywhere and they bite all day and night! Make sure you take suitable spray. We took a good spray with DEET and it didn't work - locals recommended OFF. Take some plug-ins for your rooms too.
"Hi, I got back from Old Road a couple of days ago, and despite taking the maximum DEET formula's (coils to burn and plugs in), we still got bitten but on the positive side, no sign of the virus and it was being reported in the local press that the numbers of those being diagnosed had fallen from 56-62 per reporting station (don't know how many they have) to 8-11 This is a positive feedback loop, the less with the virus, the less mosquitoes become carriers and the less they can transmit it to others!"
"Chikungunya in Caribbean/Americas Region (Update) 17 Nov 2014Antigua and Barbuda, 1376 suspected cases, 18 confirmed.…scot.nhs.uk/news/newsdetail.aspx…"
I would never rely on coils or plug ins to prevent mosquito bites - in Canada or in the Caribbean. You need to spray repellent on your clothes and exposed skin.
"We returned on the 21st Dec 14, my hubby and I had about 20 odd bites each despite covering ourselves with stinky high level deet spray every night ! however we thankfully had no side effects from the bites ! x"
"I meet a great many visitors in my job and the conversation frequently turns to bites at some point in the day. A few quick questions usually highlights gaps in people's protection.jRules to follow:1. You may get bitten in first couple of hours of arrival if you do not use protection from the word go. Mosquitos do not offer any amnesty just because you only just arrived! Be prepared or make a visit to the resort shop to buy repellent and bug spray the first thing you do.2. Use high level of deet - 50% is best- Off in bright orange or dark green cans is best.3. Now is not the time to experiment with ""something my friend swears by "" - stick to the tried and tested Off.4. When I say use it, I mean use it liberally on all exposed skin except face - not just a dab like perfume.5. Spray a little on hand and wipe around your neck.6. Do not wear perfume or strong smelling deodorant - it attracts Mosquitos .7. repeat of no1 , waiting until after your evening shower is too late, spray late afternoon and again after shower., the Mosquitos will not give you a pass till after you have showered! 8. Applying sun block over deterent reduces/ stops entirely the effectiveness of the deterrent.9. Spray room with bug spray when leaving for the evening.and 10. If you wake up in the night and can hear a mosquito get up and use bug spray- hoping it will go away just means waking in the morning with a bite.This all sounds a nuisance? Well no more than applying sun block ( and I hope you do that) and following all this means I can go months without getting bitten - until the day I forget when they will still find me!Edited: 5 years ago "
Sandflies were so horrible at sandals it ruined our vacation ... The wife and myself have decided to never visit the Caribbean again. hopefully we don't come down with anything.
Can I please ask for those of you who have gotten bit badly did it happen at the resorts ?( Corrine P hubby 20 bites ) We are staying at Galley Bay and realize we must be prepared but starting to wonder if we picked the best destination for our holiday. Thank you JabberwockyNick for your detail guidelines and suggestions as it is greatly appreciated.
Thank you Nick for your valuable advise! I should print it off & post it everywhere as a reminder!
Nick's advice is exactly what we would give summer visitors to Canada (although the mosquitoes in some areas here are far worse than anything I've ever experienced in the Caribbean).
"We stayed at Galley Bay 7/8years ago in one of their huts. I got bitten quite a lot , and I guess it didn't help with the lagoon behind the resort. However I didnt wear any protection. We are going back to the island this year are are naturally concern but will heed all the advice given.Hopefully this is a bit of good news....abstvradio.com/chikungunya-on-the-decline/"
"Thanks for your advice Nick. My husband and I are going to Grand Pineapple Beach next week and are extremely concerned about the Chikungunya risks. Very little help or advice from our travel company or the hotel itself. As several people say on TripAdvisor - you don't hear it talked about or how wide-spread it is now. I only found out about it (after booking our holiday) from an article in the Saturday Telegraph on 15th November. No mention from the tour operator of course!We will take your advice on board as we are both 'seniors' and I have arthritis, so do not need to come home with Chikungunya and yet more aches and pains!.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Awesome Nick, really appreciate the advice."
"So, you're at Grand Pineapple now! How is it? Any sign of construction? How bad are the mozzies? I hope you are having a wonderful time - Grand Pineapple is one of our favorite places in the world and we hope to return in March."
"We don't go til next Thursday Annmarie, and I think the renovation is not starting til next year. Hope it's not while we're there!Will update on chikingunya situation on Tripadvisor when we get there."
Have a lovely time!!
"Just a heads up that dengue is also around, however only in one particular part atm.http://abstvradio.com/dengue-on-the-rise/"
"I was in Jolly Beach in Nov and there were thousands of the damm things and people were getting bitten all over. They did not appear to the the Chick Virus ones though, cant speak for your resort but at JB they were doing nothing to control them."
"Just returned on Saturday the 10th from the GPBR. They fogged twice. I found the timing of the fogging a bit peculiar. Around 530pm when people were at the bar or at the snack bar. However, I only got bitten once the whole time I was there and my wife did not get any bites. We only sprayed Off on ourselves before going for dinner. It was windy during the day (Christmas wind) so we really didn't see any mosquitos morning or daytime. I would suggest bringing a spray just to be on the safe side. I will post my review of the resort soon."
Thank you for posting GZerbie and thrilled you and your wife had minimal bites. Do you think possibly as we are going into a dryer season ....less mosquito's ??? We are at GB early March and keeping fingers crossed
Thanks GZerbie. Look forward to the review. Hope you had a nice holiday.
Thanks for your update GZerbie. I've just been assured by the Hayes and Jarvis agent that 'they fog twice a day at all resorts'. Interesting.........
"DKG Calgary Yes they are going into dry season but the little buggers still came out at dusk but I hardly noticed them. Bring some Off with you. We brought Deep Woods dry because we didn't know what to expect. It did the trick.Ann Marie we made the best of it. The beach was wonderful. Vicki Mills, they only fogged twice at our resort on Wednesday and Thursday at dusk. I can`t speak to other resorts but I highly doubt they fog twice a day."
"Thank you GZerbie , we will definitely pack the bug spray and hopefully will only need at dusk. The restaurants at GB from my research are all outdoors's so we need to be prepared. Hope we have the same experience as you did. Thanks again for taking the time to comment."
"I would heed other suggestions to apply ""Off"" as soon as you deplane! The dangerous mosguito type is out during the day. At least that's the idea I get from everything that's been posted & various articles I've read.Edited: 5 years ago "

I'd be interested to know how many recorded cases there have been in Antigua lately. I'd never heard of this until the Daily Mail (UK) ran a huge scare story about it in the Autumn when we were already booked for Christmas. It worried me a little and worried others travelling with me even more. Happily we are all back healthy having all got the odd inevitable mossy bite. Antigua would do well to publish such figures if they are minimal to avoid people not booking (or keep it quiet I suppose if it is indeed a problem!).
"Here in Antigua it is not something we are lying awake worrying about. Tip - don't take medical advice from the Daily Mail, they don't sell papers using the headline "" There has been an increase in X but numbers of cases may already be falling again"" You might note that I think in the 85 posts in this thread only one person has mentioned actually catching the virus - (which was clearly unpleasant for him but which is often much less serious) . More important is that it is almost entirely preventable if you take precautions which have been set out umpteen times already. But you do need to take personal responsibility and apply repellent and stop asking what "" they"" are doing about it."
Just returned after a wonderful trip. One week at Sandals and one week at Galley Bay. Both resorts were fogging just before dusk. We took Deep Woods Off (25% deet) my husband and Off Family Care (15% deet) for myself due to sensitive skin and used it everyday all day. He didn't get any bites but I did get about 8 over the 2 weeks. Now it appears I may have come down with the virus but the frustrating part is getting a confirmed diagnosis here in Canada. My physician didn't even know about chikungunya so her diagnosis for now is the flu and is taking a wait and see approach. This joint pain does not feel like the flu!! In hindsight I wish I would've taken more long pants to wear in the evening as all of my bites were on my lower legs. Also switching to the stronger deet formula Off helped. Cleaning staff leave the door wide open while making up the room so having whole room protection or wearing Off while sleeping is important too. I'm on day 3 of what feels like chikungunya and am hoping that I'll be lucky and be over it soon.
Thanks 2weeksayear for posting. I hope you recover quickly and get an accurate diagnosis. We will be at G.B. and taking note of your tips. Thrilled you had a wonderful trip and wishing you a very speedy recovery.
"We always use ""AVON SKIN SO SOFT ORIGINAL OIL BODY SPRAY"" when we go to Antigua or St Lucia. It is an alternative to insect repellent. My husband starts using it about 2 weeks before we go every now and then and he normally gets bitten loads when he is away. There is shower gel as well. There are rumours that the Royal Marines and SAS as well as the US Army use it."
Some official figures here....for what its worth.Not looking too bad for Antiguafile:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Administrator/My%20Documents/Downloads/2015-ene-23-cha-CHIKV-cases-ew-03.pdf
"Hi ripple - unfortunately you've linked to a file on your own PC, which obviously we can't see, rather than a weblink."
We are trying to plan a Caribbean vacation. I am pregnant and keep seeing this virus in every forum I visit. I will not wear any deet containing bug spray. Any suggestions for best island to avoid the virus??? Traveling early March.
"Hi ripple 11 - can't seem to click on your link, but have just returned from Antigua (Grand Pineapple Beach), and didn't find there was a big problem. They fogged 3 times in our first week, and again 3 times in our second.I think GPB is probably not too bad, as it is on the Atlantic coast and gets a nice onshore breeze, but I hear it's not so good on the leeward side of the island. I did meet one Antiguan guy on the beach who had ChickV in August, and still gets pain in his fingers, and said he felt really ill when he had it. And he lives there.Mossies were probably worse in August, but I still recommend people to use plenty of Off and be on the safe side. It is NOT a nice thing to get."
"Kayce,The whole region has been affected, though the current reports suggest numbers are dropping. It's also reached the mainland US, so it's pretty hard to avoid completely. Some of the small island resorts might be an option though.There are alternatives to DEET based sprays, though not all of them are suitable for use during pregnancy (especially the first trimester), so the only obvious solution is to stay as well covered up as possible. My understanding, though, is that repellents containing up to 50% DEET are safe to use during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding, provided they're used in accordance with manufacturers guidelines. Many good repellents are as low as 20% concentration, and simply need to be reapplied more often to remain effective.It might be worth doing a bit more research on this one, and perhaps seeking an opinion from your OB?"
