"Since it is declared coronavirus case in Zagreb, I want to buy N95 or N99 mask. Where can I find it? Thank you."
Thank you very much. I will visit now
"Since I can not understand Croatian and new to Zagreb, may I ask you do you know anything about does the Croatian authorities taking necessary precautions about that epidemic?"
"1-) I hope they did as you said. But I am not sure the authorities are taking this serious. I arrived to Vienna at 17 Feb and there was not a single x-ray. Only person was me in the Airport and city who wears mask for protection. That situation was same in Croatia too. I hope the situation is as you said. 2-) Thank you for the links, I have already read them. There was no mask at Bauhaus and other similar shops. I think the blackmarket is being created."
All this mask are cool but I visit all sites and I can't find any mask . Then I watched a video tutorial how to sew a mask for kids . Here is that video https://www.youtube.com/watchâ€¦
"Dear Mariana,Thank you for the video. It is really cute. The mask with a fabric like that is nothing more than a classic surgical mask. It has to be touched only by ropes and after usage has to be washed with detergent on high degrees like 60 or more in washing machine. But since, finding any kind of mask is nearly impossible, your effort/video owners effort is remarkable. Our kids don't understand that epidemics and such a sweet masks will be helpfull to reduce stress. Be healthy madam."
