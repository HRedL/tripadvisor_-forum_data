"I would be interested in how Ruth Christ restaurant owners have responded to problems with food poisoning. My wife and I ate at the Ruth Christ restaurant in Las Vegas in January of 2011 and both got very sick and cut short our stay as a result. Despite repeated calls to the restaurant and to the Ruth Chris corporation's offices in Florida, we never received anything from the restaurant other than a letter stating that the owner's insurance agent would be in touch. I have never received such incredibly callous treatment from any restaurant in my life. The Ruth Christ company refuses to get involved and they have stated that they have no control over an independent operator which is of course a convenient lie."
Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.
Breeze: For some it's an almost religious dining experience.
"""Breeze: For some it's an almost religious dining experience.""Hee hee!! :D"
Breeze: Ruth Christ was Jesus' aunt. Made a to-die-for cobbler.
I guess it's not religious anymore if they got food poisoning.If you have doctor's notes or anything to confirm the food poisoning I would also write to the Nevada Attorney General and Department of Consumer Affairs with your complaint. I bet you get action after they get involved.Good luck.
"I bet someone in that house uttered some ""Oh God's"" and ""Oh Christ's"""
"Could have been an exorcism, expelling the old, evil food. And replacing it with the good new food."
Are you SURE it wasn't Ruth Christ's Ellis Island Casino and Brewery ? Did you have the tube steak while in Vagas?
""" I have never received such incredibly callous treatment from any restaurant in my life.""How often do you write to restaurants complaining of food poisoning? What's your point of comparison here?""both got very sick and cut short our stay as a result. ""I can't imagine leaving a hotel room with a bathroom within 10 feet and driving or flying home with food poisoning symptoms. Yech."
"I would think there's not much any restaurant could do about someone claiming they got food poisoning. I'm not sure if they or you could be sure it came from them when you factor in all the different places you had eaten at during your stay. I am sorry you became ill though, that's never fun especially on vacation."
"The other difficulty is in determining where you got food poisoning. Onset can be anywhere from a couple of hours to two days, so blaming the last restaurant isn't really fair....or, for that matter, was it even food poisoning? For example, the infamous Norovirus can be transmitted not just by food and water. Did you ever touch a handrail, or door handle, or door knob, or just about anything else? If so, you may have been infected that way."
"I agree with jlo and Irishfan. Most restaurants will deflect accusations of food poisoning for the reasons jlo stated, unless it becomes an epidemic and it is clear they were the source."
Yeah for those of us that have actually had food poisining you know that travelling in a car even a short distance or airplane is quite impossible. maybe they had a rv? in any case most food poisoning symtoms only last 24-48 hours so again another reason to just ride it out instead of going home.
"Big chain restaurants probably get hundreds, if not thousands, of complaints every day similar to yours. What did you expect, for them to cut you a check on the spot? Even if they did something like saying ""sorry"", that would be an acknowledgement that they did indeed give you food poisoning and open a big can of worms legally.How exactly can you prove that this restaurant gave you food poisoning? Can you even prove that you did indeed have food poisoning? If this did happen, why did you wait 7-8 months to take any action in regards to it?"
And so what happened when the insurance company contacted you?Edited: 9 years ago 
"Ruth Christ! I demand seperation of Church and TA! LOL I assume Ruth's Chris is the only Restaurant they both ate in together,No way they could have gotten it from somewhere else.Accusing someone of Food Poisoning on a public forum probably isn't too smart,they may hear back from ""RC's"" lawyers but it won't be about thier illness either"
Please go to the Food Poisoning forum !!!!!
"Did you want a gift certificate for a return visit? Did you visit a doctor before you left to document the symptoms and timing? If you can't prove your case, why would you expect to be paid?"
"This happened, allegedly, six months ago. What do you want them to do? If it was even Ruth's Chris that made you sick, the most they can offer you is an apology and a free steak. And I'd assume, if the steak is honestly what made you so deathly ill, you wouldn't want that anyway. Move on, please. Do yourself a favor and move forward."
Another one bites the dust. One more poster that just posts once never to return.
"""Another one bites the dust. One more poster that just posts once never to return.""well..they DO have more than one post. Just not on this forum. What's interesting is the reviews they've done. Where the illness today apparently lasted for a while and caused them to leave town early. But in their review it says it only lasted 24 hours.Then there's the other review from a couple years ago where they accuse some OTHER place of giving them food poisoning...interesting."
I didn't know Jaco was now into coffee plantations! So that's where he's been...
"I have had food poisoning six times from food at restaurants which is probably a low number and every other time the restaurant manager or owner phoned me back to apologize and to offer a complimentary dinner. Considering that I paid for a dinner, was violently ill for eight hours, to offer to replace the meal seems like the least any business should do. Why should a restaurant with a defective product be held to a lesser standard than any other business? I think with food and health matters they should be held to a higher standards. I consider food poisoning a serious concern and not a source for stupid attempts at humor. According to the US CDC:More than 200 known diseases are transmitted through food (1). The causes of foodborne illness include viruses, bacteria, parasites, toxins, metals, and prions, and the symptoms of foodborne illness range from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening neurologic, hepatic, and renal syndromes. In the United States, foodborne diseases have been estimated to cause 6 million to 81 million illnesses and up to 9,000 deaths each year When restaurant management does not respond it tells me that they do not care about health standards for their business and that their establishment is not going to be a safe place to eat."
"Ruth Christ, because they spent the rest of their vacation on their knees."
"I definitely don't think that is a low number for number of times to be food poisoned. I've never had FP and neither has my husband. And we eat out quite a bit. Very often, really.The concern about proving food poisoning is the time it takes for symptoms to set in. I assume since you've had it seven times you are aware that if you became sick immediately after leaving RC that it was, in fact, not RC's fault. Even if you and your wife only ate one of the same food items in the 24 to 48 hours before you got sick, again, it's hard to be sure you've been FP because as another poster pointed out, it could be norovirus or something similar. Just curious (and I'm not implying you're wrong here) but why do you think it was RC that made you ill?"
How many times have you slipped and fallen on the properties of prominent companies?
rofl nightdrive
This restaurant made me violently ill! I want you to give me a free meal so I can see if it happens again!!!!!
"I'm 41, have never had food poisoning, and eat out multiple times a week. The wife has had it once in her life, from a McDonalds.Six times to ACCUSE restaurants of giving you food poisoning is nowhere near a ""low number""- Sorry."
"Call my attys.""Dewey,Cheatem and Howe"" They love these kind of cases,no extra charge for neck braces either.I have never had food poisoning.Sounds like you like to make a habit out of getting free dinners."
"Food poisoning 6 times from restaurants.That's actually an extraordinarily high number of times.I eat out most of my meals, and I may have had it once. It's hard to tell where these things originate without making far reaching assumptions."
"You all are a bunch of inconsiderate meanies. You problably haven't had to go vomit in a toilet that already had a vomitter on it. You probably never had the runs and discovered that when you got to your bathroom, there was already a ""runner"" on the throne. Not like you share the throne, right?"
"They're the Bonnie and Clyde of Botulism!The Daring Duo of diarrhea!They get ""WEcoli""!Edited: 9 years ago "
omg...lolAlready runners?The daring duo of diarrhea?!? lmaaoYou guys are killing me today.
"I can certainly empathize with the poster.On one Vegas trip, I took the Deuce downtown to play at the Nugget. Found my favorite slot, put in my cash, kissed the button (I do this before every spin) and played about 3 hours. I left because some snot-nose next to me was sneezing all over the place but finished my drink sitting between us first. Took the Deuce back toward downtown. Bus was packed. I hugged the rail with both hands. I stopped in at Slots-O'-Fun and hustled in for a big dog. I had just lubed it up good with mustard when a biker bumped into me and the dog hit the deck. Within 5 seconds I had picked it up so all's well. The next day I go eat breakfast at some fancy-schmancy, top shelf restaurant and before I can get four bites of my tartar and over-easies, I come down with a hellacious case of the squirts and start spewing like fire hydrant. I call the manager over and tell him that they gave me food poisoning. He wouldn't do nuthing for me even though I told him I was going to sue his seersuckers off. The nerve of some of these places..."
Hitch...thanks for the laughs
"Geez at my age of over a half century, including stops in foreign countries with questionable sanitation practices, I've had food poisoning maybe 4 times. And I surely never wanted a free meal from any place that made me sick."
Blah Blah BlahWhat a waste of forum spaceGet over it !!!
"nightdrive, Hitch....LOL!"
""" have had food poisoning six times from food at restaurants which is probably a low number ""Seriously??? Six times??? I strongly recommend you picking better places to eat! My DH is a chef and I can tell you we eat out a LOT. Food is our life. I have gotten food poisoning once and it was self induced. I grabbed the wrong containter of chicken salad out of my own refrigerator that I had purchased from the deli and not thrown away when I bought the new container. Not to mention I was 8 months pregnant. I definitely would NOT have left my hotel room. I basically slept on the bathroom floor."
"ShowMeVegas, your's doesn't count because you didn't have the Emperor's Buffet. Cstorm, I hear you, and soon the whole world will....I've gotten food poisoning also from stuff in out own refrigerator. I don't tell the wife to flush leftovers anymore, I do it myself."
"ShowMeVegas, did you lick your players card too? I know I do... THEN kiss the play button or french kiss with the arm of the said one arm bandit! ;)"
"Pookie, I thought that play button and arm tasted like margaritas. Now I know why."
"I saw the woman who played the slot before me licking the glass so, since it had already been done, I felt like for me to do it would have been redundant.As she left, I overheard her say to her husband, ""Hey, I feel like steak. Let's go to Ruth's Christ""..."
"""As she left, I overheard her say to her husband, ""Hey, I feel like steak. Let's go to Ruth's Christ""...""You misunderstood. The woman has a sister, Ruth. Everyone knows Ruth is a horrible cook. What the woman said was"" Let's go to Ruth's. Christ, even HER food is better than THIS joint."""
Hmmm... The op didn't mention where they were staying I will bet dollars to donuts that they drank some pool water from the Luxor! We know just how sick people get from doing that.;)
"Yup HH, extra lime! :) Sorry about the salt on the screen.. I always spill!!"
I didn't know food poisoning was included in the resort fee at the Luxor...just another added benefit!
...this thread is so entertaining....lol
Food poisoning from the pool and free kids at check in.
"I saw there were 50 posts here and thought it was misprint- that didn't take long...Can I play too? I got Monty's Revenge once in Mexico (yeah the exotic foreign version ) and I promise you I would have much preferred the domestic, religious Ruth Christ version as I worshiped at the porcelain altar for days- no self respecting airplane would have let me on...These posters really need to eat all their meals at home- they seem very prone to food borne illness( or maybe they are prone to free steak-itis )"
"Food poisoning in Vegas is not fun. My DH got it and we barely made it home on the plane. It was all he could do to keep it in! LOL!To OP, sorry there are so many goof balls on here, but all you can do, which is what we did, is report it to the County Health Dept, and they compare it to any other reports that they get and is the only way for a food poisoning case to be verified. Just like the Aria situation, multiple reports would trigger an investigation, so your duty was to report it and just send an email to the restaraunt, because you can never be sure exactly where it came from. Don't expect anything for your inconvenience, is the chance you take anywhere you travel."
"Hey lay off guys, it's not his fault Ruth Christ made him vomick!!"
"This is the funniest thing I have read in a long time!Does Ruth Christ have services on Sunday? If so, what time?Edited: 9 years ago "
"Omg, my stomach is hurting!! Maybe it's that Mexican food I had for dinner earlier.....or maybe it's from laughing so dang hard!!!WEcoli!!!! Nightdrive, u freakin rock!! Ya'll are cracking me up!!And yeah, if I thought I got food poisoning somewhere, you dang right I want some more of their food!!! lol"
"I got food poisoning from some bad fish back in 1993 and I haven't been able to eat fish since. I can't imagine that the OP had honest to goodness food poisoning but rather a little too much alcohol with dinner or even maybe an allergic reaction. I don't know, sounds like serial food poisoning, if you know what I mean."
All of you people slay me.
"I have had food poisoning once when eating out. I dine out several times a week so getting food poisoning six times is a huge amount. I reported it to the pub where I got ill and the council but did not expect the pub to give me anything in return, I just wanted them to be aware so they could address the issue and prevent others from getting so sick.But, had they offered me a free meal, I would not have taken them up on it - they gave me food poisoning! Why on earth would you want a freebie that could make you sick again? And why wait six months to rant on here, not to warn, but to complain about the failure to provide another plate of botulism, this time, for free?Edited: 9 years ago "
"I think the OP's second post commenting he's had it ""six times from food at restaurants which is probably a low number""....Implies they likely had food poisoning from restaurants more than half-a-dozen times.Not remembering how many times one had food poisoning in their life, reducing the figure to a crude estimate, is amazing.And, to have collected a complimentary dinner in each instance, at least a perfect 6 and 0 record, is equally amazing."
"Showme, Irish, ND, Hitch, Funny, funny, You guys could write comedy. So much fun. I need some kleenex, the tears are just rolling down."
"Goldenlover, I think we should keep that attorney on file just for all the TA members, Dewey, Cheatem, and How. The next time I slip or go to Ruth Christ, I'll remember."
"I traveled a lot in 3rd World Countries in my youth, and while I'm not sure I want to spend the time counting how many times I've gotten food poisoning from eating at a restaurant, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't at least 6. While I should have known better than to eat some of those meals (the 40c sausage kebabs in Marrakesh were just too cheap to be any good), most of the times I got really sick was from eating at western-style establishments: an expensive pizzeria in Amman and the pizza hut in Agra come to mind, for example. My best friend got terribly, terribly sick after eating the salad bar at a 5-star hotel in Luxor - so, apparently, did half the people in the tour we had joined for the dinner. My husband and toddler spent a couple of days worshiping the porcelain god after eating at an expensive Recoleta steak house in Buenos Aires. This is all to say that you can't always tell how safe the food at restaurant is based on the dining room or the menu prices. Indeed, just watch Kitchen Nightmares and you'll be scared about dining out anywhere again.I don't recall having gotten food poisoning eating out in the US, but plenty of people do. If I did get food poisoning from a restaurant I could identify here (and really, it's not that hard to figure out where you got whatever it was that made you sick), I would expect the restaurant to be apologetic, if nothing else. If it was a chain restaurant, I would also expect them to promise they'd do an inspection of the franchisee's premises."
"I've gotten what I've believed to be food poisoning several times in my life...and not once have I ever thought to accuse the restaurant for all the reasons stated...you just don't know where or when or what caused it.One time I did know for sure...we were in Bordeaux, and they had olive oil on the table, and it didn't taste right. I looked carefully at the carafe and it was filled with shrimp! Tiny, dead, raw shrimp in olive oil you used on your bread! I was sick for a day or two after that.I'm also thankful it was just D or V for a few hours or day or so...look at the cases of E coli that have truly killed many people...a garden variety stomach ache every once in a while is just part of life."
"@soyyo..Right about Kitchen Nightmares. Also, I believe I have had food poisening/lysteria etc..both times it was (i believe) from asian restaurants(not in LV..in Mpls). We wondered if maybe they were reheating the leftover buffet food from the day before as one of the owners made a comment saying he had some of a particular dish the day before........but we could not concretly prove we were sick from their food. Both restaurants are now closed."
"The Last Supper, so to speak, what did you have to eat?"
My husband got food poisoning one time in Vegas and we had to leave that day. He spent the 4 hour flight home in the bathroom puking his guts out. I felt so bad for the people in the back of the plane we were. By the time we landed he felt better but wiped out.We never thought of suing the restaurant and yes we think we know which one it was.
