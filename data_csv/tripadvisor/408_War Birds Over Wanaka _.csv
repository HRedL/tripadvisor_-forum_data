"Hi, Has any one heard any news of cancellation of this event ?There is nothing mentioned on their website.I realise it is a month away and things are changing daily, but just wondered if anyone is in the know.Thank you for your time."
"No, no indication of any possible cancellation. There's no known or probable cases identified in the South Island yet (yet!) and no community transmission identified, so on that basis no suggestion of cancellation. Our A & P show is on this weekend, a biggish local event (though nothing like the scale of Warbirds of course), and that's going ahead.I can't speculate where things will sit come Easter of course, but that's where they are at at the moment.Edited: 8:29 pm, March 11, 2020 "
Thank you for your reply. I will be keeping my fingers crossed (and washed). :)
"We’re in New Plymouth for WOMAD, which is going ahead this weekend."
Nothing has been cancelled in NZ yet as we have no cases of community transferred Covid-19 .
Here is the latest from New Zealandhttps:/…
"Hi OP you likely know this now and the flight restrictions may have caused you to cancel anyway, but Warbirds has this afternoon been cancelled."

"Thank you for your reply. Yes because of the travel restrictions we had already cancelled our trip. WOW was the main reason for this trip for Hubbys 60th. Oh well, looks like it will be for his 62th now. :) Take care everyone."
"Beyond sad Warbirds is cancelled, but large gatherings are currently off the menu around the world. Look out America's Cup, Olympics and more. (Japan says Olympics will stall happen, but it's only 4 months away - things can get very much worse in those 4 months)."
