"Hi, I'm travelling with family (kids 12 and 18) around Sri Lanka for 10 days in February. We are only staying in hotels.I've had conflicting advice concerning vaccinations. My NHS surgery has told us we don't require Hep A or Typhoid (and we will have to pay privately as they no longer provide them) but advice from other agencies online recommends them. Not sure whether they are needed or not?Any advice appreciated."
"Official NHS site definitely tells Hep-A, don't go without. Typhoid is relevant for stays of 14 days or longer (due to the small doses building up in your body through even boiled water and baked food), so N/A for you.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
Thanks for the reply - is there any chance you can provide a link to the NHS website you referred to - the one my GP surgery pointed me at says both aren't required (hence the confusion)!Thank you
"Hope you understand that those vaccines are not required by Sri Lanka. They are what you should have for your protection. So basically it is your decision and whether your govt will pay.Having said that, I will not travel without hep-a vaccine and also rabies if your kids might pet a dog or a cat while over there."
Herehttps:/…sri-lankaFor sure Hep-A used to be on a more compulsory level; unlike JE everyone has risk for it!< Erik> & [Sandya]
"Checked one other non-English European health site, and Hep_A is compulsory there. Hence no idea why it changed at NHS site...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
Hep A&B and tetanus are worthwhile whether traveling or not.
I got CFS/ME from vaccines so I will never take them again where ever I go. Engerix-B and Pandemrix are some of the worst ones. So I can't recommend them to anyone else either. Today I know how to treat myself in alternative ways without side effects. But I'm not a doctor and everyone makes their own decision.
"Yes and anti-vaxers recently have been responsible for a few epidemies, e.g. measles in some Pacific island killing 50-100 people of which a lot innocent kids. Hence #7 is ready to be totally ignored...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"The vaccines themselves spread the epidemics. It's part of the Agenda 21. The Samoan epidemic was instigated and inflamed by the forced vaccines. Like happened in Africa with Ebola. The doctors who were really helping and treating people like Dr. Howard Robins and Dr. Robert Rowen, using ozone therapy, were driven out by the corrupt government, while the vaccinators kept pushing their poison and people kept falling ill.https:/…Check out what Peter C Gøtzsche has to say about the current state of medical ""science""..https://www.deadlymedicines.dk/home/"
"I guess it will be removed time and time again.TA is for travel advice to each other based on one's own experiences. Hence your opinion/experience in 7 is okay. As is my reply in 8 as I find it distorting the truth (for Sri Lanka and worldwide) and bad advice.The rant you are starting now however is just trolling and far beyond the scope of the travel forum, and hence should stop. Find another place on the www for it.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
Obviously Tripadvisor does not allow conversation and presenting dissenting information in a cordial manner. What a totalitarian sandbox.
"Nope, it does not allow trolling, political discussions etc. That is the difference between your post 7 and what you started afterwards.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Tripadvisor does not just remove postings. They are removed only after the community reports them to be inappropriate. Did you see the link at the bottom right of every post? That is where a post gets reported. So your posts were reported to the Admins as inappropriate and that is why they were removed....entendio?Your anti-vexx posting does not belong on the forum. This for travel. Go and debate/shout/scream at the appropriate place. Not here.Edited: 9:34 am, January 11, 2020 "
"I just plainly presented dissenting point of view with facts from doctors on the field; Dr. Howard Robins, Dr Robert Rowen and Peter C. Gøtzsche. This is a topic about vaccine recommendations and I posted views that are contrasting yours. Nowhere I have been shouting or screaming or trolling. Dissenting opinions and hardly debunkable facts are not trolling. Who are you to decide what is ""inappropriate"" if it's just point of view you can't handle or comprehend? I could also flag all pro-vaccine posts as ""inappropriate"". Maybe I should do so. With your logic pro-vaccine topics, replies and recommendations do not belong here either. Find another place for it."
"Nope you are not presenting facts as science agrees on it (and 99% of the civilians too) but a campaign of 'fake science' which is responsible for hundreds of dead, often innocent, people. And that is trolling.So it will keep on being reported here for what it is, totally out of scope for a travel forum...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
