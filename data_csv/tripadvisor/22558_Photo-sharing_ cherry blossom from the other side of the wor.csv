"Like many others we have cancelled our spring trip to Japan. Not on par with those lovely cherry blossom sites in Japan here are some sakura photos from a small park in our home town. Hopefully it will trigger off some kind souls to post some recent sakura photos in Japan to quench our thirst (and those who can’t going there for the season). Thank you.https:/…It seems the title falls short of the last word ""world"".Edited: 7:02 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"William512Lovely photos of blossoms in full (I think?) bloom on a clear blue day (thought it always rained in Vancouver in winter/spring? :-)I recently posted an album of plum, sakura cherry blossoms, and a few other spring blooms from Tokyo circa 2007 - 2019 at Tokyo Blossoms: Photos https:/…tokyo-blossoms-photos-2e07995d763bI am currently editing, and hope to have finished this weekend, pictures of Sunday's near-full blossoms accented with a freak spring snowstorm - the heaviest this year. Some of the best sakura and other blossom pictures I've seen, if I do say so myself, I'll post them when ready..."
Thank you William512 for sharing those from Vancouver.Wish you safe and well.
"Wow tokyoaaron02, what lovely photos! You really put me to shame with your professional photographic skill. Eagerly await for more!You are right about Vancouver too. Winter here is miserable, it rains a lot and it gets dark very soon – before 16.00. Spring is coming along and we are getting a bit more sun now. Those blossoms on my photos still have a couple of days before full bloom."
"William512 your pictures do a noice job of capturing the tree canopies, and creating a sense of ""three-dimensionality: especially the tree-lined path.I'll post more pics soon, including ""blossoms in snow"" and some straight-up blossoms in 2020: the year of the rat snaps. They're past prime, and it was windy in Tokyo yesterday, but still managed to get some snaps today..."
"Thanks for the posts and images. My favorite location for Cherry Blossoms outside of Japan is actually Santa Fe, New Mexico. I think it is because the flowers look so good against the adobe buildings. I will try to get some together and post. In the meantime, here is something different, images from the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington D.C. https:/…"
"Wow Charles L, Washingtonians have really taken the Japanese hanami party, fused it with cosplay, and come up with something unique!"
"Thanks, William512,I was in Japan until about ten days ago but too early for sakura in Kyoto - saw a few from the train on my way to NRT!"
"Thank you Charles L, nice to see such a festive event in this part of the world. At what exact dates is the festival being held, and is it running this year !?"
"Wow marajapantraveler, how lucky you are still being able to travel to Japan during such turbulent time ! Any difficulty encountered and were you in quarantine coming back to the US !? New York is a hard hit area, how is thing back home ? Stay safe and would love to hear from you again about your future trips to Japan."

"Haven't finished yet with some of the more creative pics from this year's cherry blossom season (at night; in the snow; etc.), but I did put together a straightforward collection of pictures from Ueno, Inokashira, Yasukuni, and a few other local favourites...https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/tokyo-blossoms-2020-63207f610aaf"
"Thanks Wiliam512. We are heading into autumn in this part of the world, so no blossom here! But it's lovely to see the beautiful flowers appearing elsewhere.In a different timeline, this should have been my last full day in Tokyo, before moving on to Osaka tomorrow. *sigh* Oh well, fingers crossed for same time, next year instead.Stay safe everyone."
Thank you again tokyoaaron02 for your artistic portfolio.
"Hi MumPlusOne, good to hear from you. Yes, it’s a real pity not being able to travel to Japan right now. We would have flown over in about 10 days’ time and go for cherry blossom in one of our most beloved regions which is Tohoku. Putting spring behind us we are looking at an autumn trip to Kansai, hopefully during the second half of this coming November. Although it doesn’t seem too promising right now we pray that things would calm down by then.BTW, how are things going in your country!? Apparently you are in a better shape than us as cases here in Canada are rising fast. A friend of mine in Sydney told me she and her husband are taking in a new pastime at home – gardening."
"William512, I guess you could say that Australia is in better shape than many other parts of the world, but we still have cases here and the numbers are rising. It's still only a slow rise and of course we all hope that there won't be the exponential explosion of cases seen elsewhere. Pretty significant lockdown measures are now in place, but who knows if they'll be enough. We'll have to wait and see. For anyone interested in following the Australian situation, this is a good site (and not behind a paywall):https://www.abc.net.au/news/Edited: 3:05 am, April 04, 2020 "
"Thanks for thinking of this topic, William512! I hope others will also post pics from around the world. Don't they say looking at pictures of nature is almost as good for the brain as the real thing?"
"Willian512, thank you for showing us beautiful pictures of Cherry Blossom in Vancouver. I am wondering why you have become interested in Japan, especially in Tohoku Region, when you are living in Canada with very beautiful nature. And now my wonder has grown by watching your pictures: why are you interested in coming to Japan in Cherry Blossom Season, when you can enjoy Cherry Blossom in Vancouver? I remember a lady in Vancouver said to me in her letter that she is not interested in seeing Cherry Blossom in Japan, because she can enjoy it at home."

"Hi tokyoaaronn02, couldn’t agree with you more.Too bad we don’t have many (if any) Korean posters on the Japan forum as we read about some equally nice cherry blossom sites in Korea as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRXibmHmFEM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4ay-vK5ZnY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8PiV44haNw"

"#20 Wow yes Seoul really gets a full-on blizzard of cherry blossoms, doesn't it!I lived in Seoul for a year a long, long time ago, but don't remember the cherry blossoms. Seeing the pictures makes me want to visit again, see what else I've forgotten.Heard Seoul has changed quite a lot in the 20 years I've been away...Anyway, beautiful cherry blossoms!"
"Tokyo Blossoms in Snow:As if the world hasn’t gone crazy enough, heavy snow on buds and (almost) full sakura cherry and other blossoms alike. Sunday, March 29th.https:/…tokyo-blossoms-in-snow-2e69cfced760"
Thank you again tokyoaaron02 for those wonderful photos. How we wish we would be there to witness the scenes! Is the phenomenon common every early spring or is it just this year!?
"Cheers again, William 512!Was gonna say that i could only remember one other such snowfall anywhere close to what we experienced last week during hanami, but Google reminds me there were actually snowfalls during cherry blossom season in 2018 and 2015... and probably others as well.Still, last week's blizzard was the heaviest I can remember during the spring bloom - and the first time I had all my camera gear with me!"
"tokyoaaron02, those photos are sensational. Thanks for posting! Part of me wishes I had seen sakura in snow myself (and I would have been in Tokyo for this, if I hadn't cancelled my trip for obvious reasons) - but then again, I really don't like snow. If it's snowing, it's just too cold for me! So I guess I'll just be happy to look at photos instead. :)"
Thank you tokyoarron02 for your update.Yesterday we read from the news that coronavirus cases in Tokyo during the weekend had risen to 100+ daily for 2 consecutive days (118 + 143). And it is said to be suspected that more people went out for cherry blossom that had lead to the rise. Wonder if it is truly the real cause!?
"The theory I heard locally is that people were out en masse to enjoy the long weekend March 20 - 22, especially young people and especially people drinking and party at night.Hopefully what we're seeing is the ""bubble"" of cases caused by that long weekend where everyone seemed to throw caution to the wind, so to speak.I went to the parks on weekdays, before they blocked them off for the weekend. Ueno and Inokashira were busy-ish, as you can probably tell from the pics.A few couples, small groups tucked semi-discretely on blankets behind trees, sharing food and drink and carrying on more or less as normal. Most people sat quietly apart on benches or little clear spaces, doing their best to stay 2 meters apart. Yasukuni was almost deserted. As I say, during morning to mid-day on weekdays, I didn't have trouble maintaining social distance in any of the parks. I avoided the whole scene altogether during the weekend, so it might have been a different story (though, as i saw on the news, the sakura avenues and the like were blocked off from Friday).Still yes, if I were to generalize, there is a growing awareness of the seriousness of Coronavirus in Tokyo, but especially younger people don't seem to take it as seriously as middle age and older types (I remember what it feels like to believe you are young and indestructible...).The next few days should tell whether this spike is a temporary uptick or the dreaded overshoot""..."
"Thanks MumPlusOne2012! Yes, it was certainly colder than average for Tokyo that day, and my hands got wet and a little numb from operating the smartphone and camera. Still, it was definitely worth it! I've seen snow in Tokyo before, and it's always transaforms the city, but that day at last that park and blossoms became a magical, fantastical wonderland! Feel lucky to have been in the right place at the right time, with the right gear (so often one of those three crucial ingredients is missing :-)"
"# 29 Williams 512, it is true that part of the number rise might be caused by the consecutive holidays, but another reason is that more than 120 people got in-hospital infections. It affected more than seven elder people to lose their lives.www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13268509BTW, the somei yoshino started to change to green leaves. The bright pink Kanzanzakura can be seen along the streets now."
"Thank you tokyoaaron02 and Global715255 for on-the-spot information.It’s sad to see there is in-hospital infections, and with the present alarming rate it is not surprising that this kind of outbreak will happen across the globe. A similar suspected case we read is in one of the hospitals in Hong Kong although so far only 1-2 patients are involved.Besides Tokyo and Osaka we also read that there will be some sort of emergency measures going to be imposed on certain prefectures/regions such as Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Hyogo and Fukuoka. Can either of you confirm and provide more details!?"
Abe is supposed to have a news conference at 7 pm on April 7 and declare the State of Emergency. Here is a Mainichi News article in Japanese:https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl…
"(William 512 et al, I have posted my reply re the current state of the Coronavirus emergency on the 'Coronavirus (Covid-19) Information in Japan' thread to keep updated info in one place https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29423… Can I suggest we continue the Coronavirus discussion there? It also helps those looking for Coronavirus info find it in one place...""Sides, I like your original topic of Sakura pics. Makes a refreshing change of tone and topic on so many threads, and the world, right now :-)Speaking of blossoms, I went on a bike ride yesterday, - always observing social distancing of course - and spotted some late-season blooms, including the dark pink variety which appeared to be in full bloom, and the rarer white-and-pink hybrid which I've only seen a few times, including twice yesterday! I'll post some pics if i got any keepers on my smartphone..."
"Sure enough, gota few keepers of the hybrid white/light pink and dark pink cherry blossoms which look like they were in full bloom yesterday https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/daily-life-in-tokyo-april-7-on-the-brink-e8849ec245d9"
Thank you tokyoarron02
"It is the season of Kanzan and hanamomo, flower peach, and Kikumomo."
"Thank you William512, love anything that jogs my memories. we actually have all our Japan photos playing on a google home thingy so we see them everyday.....makes the wait to go back bearable"
"Global715255, can you identify these blossoms from yesterday? https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/daily-life-in-tokyo-april-7-on-the-brink-e8849ec245d9Based on Googling the names you posted in another thread, I believe they are most likely mostly hanamomo peach blossms, instead of cherry blossoms..."
"Piece of cake!! It is Genpei momo, two color peach flowers, a kind of Hanamomo, peach for appreciation of the flowers.https://botanica-media.jp/103"
"Thank you for the quick reply, Global715255! They seem bloom late in the season: full bloom over the weekend - at least in West Tokyo."
"Thank you bron2008Yes, like you and many others my wife and I are waiting eagerly to go to Japan again. We cancel our April trip and are now looking at the possibility of a late November trip to Kansai. We too have been looking back at our past Japan trip photos, but unlike you the more we look at them the more unbearable the wait becomes, LOL!"
"Tokyo Night BlossomsOkay, finally managed to get this post together of (mostly) cherry blossoms, bamboo, and other blooms of spring in the megacity. Didn't get as many ""keepers"" as I'd hoped this year, so this is post presents the best from my archive of such photos, dating back to 2008 (!).https:/…tokyo-night-blossoms-fe0804a522d0Enjoy!"
Thank you again tokyoarron02 for your input. I have also found some recent Tokyo cherry blossom + snow scenes on youtube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkYg-zRsUsQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXXRi46F2d0 https://www.youtube.com/watch…
"Some nice footage there, William512! Don't know the Onda River, but I'll have to look it up. Sensoji makes a really colourful backdrop for the falling snow! Thanks for sharing."
"Tokyoaaron, the flowers that dropped are Camellias, Tsubaki.椿"
"Thanks, Global715255! Those flowers, Camellias, are pretty enough when they are in bloom on their bushes, but I especially love to photograph them once they've fallen in clusters on the ground and are in different stages of decay."
Hirosaki castle park is closed but here are some beautiful cherry blossom scenes of the place this spring.https://www.youtube.com/watch… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVSNLPHEpcQ
