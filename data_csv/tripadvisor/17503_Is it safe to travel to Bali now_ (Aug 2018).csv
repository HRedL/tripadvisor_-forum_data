"We have flights booked to Bali later this week (10th Aug), and were planning to stay in Seminyak and Ubud. Given the recent earthquake in Lombok and the tsunami warning, is it safe to travel?"
Please read the other similar posts on here.
Safe!
Where can i find the other posts? Do you have the links?
"We are in Bali on the Island of Nusa Lembongan. Yes we felt the Earthquake, but all is back to normal today.The Earthquake was on Lombok an Island half an hours flight away.Where you are staying some people felt it some did not.In the long run it is up to you wether you cancel. We will continue our holiday and feel completely safe."
"There should be no problems at all, unless there is another major earthquake and tsunami. However, nobody can predict earthquakes. On local news they described yesterdays earthquake as the big one so hopefully there will only be minor aftershocks now. But actually we never know and only you can decide."
"We're in the same boat, scheduled to travel to Bali on the 9th. All stories I read lump both islands effected together so it makes it hard to tell how severe the effects were on Bali specifically. I'm wondering if Bali is pretty much fully functional and even if it is, is the situation in Lombok so extensive that the local focus in Bali is on helping neighboring Lombok.We don't want to be the idiot tourists expecting to ""vacation"" during a serious emergency situation where resources like temporary shelter are needed for residents of Lombok"
"Hi , hope everything is ok and u are enjoying your stay. What about Nusa Dua is it ok there coz I will fly recently!"
We are also flying out Saturday and feel slightly worried about risk. As I understand Gili Islands are being evacuated but Bali seems okay. Could anyone recommend an alternative to Gili? I think we are just going to take the chance and hope for the best. My friend is in Bali at the moment and he seems fairly calm about it all.
"come on guys, I live in bali and is perfectly safe, zero problems..."
"Thank you for all your responses - they were very helpful. My family and I will continue with our vacation as planned, and arrive in Bali on the 10th. From what I understand, Bali is extremely prone to earthquakes and the tsunami warning that was issued earlier as a precaution and has now been lifted."
Hi stay safe. Hope all i well. I will be travelling there soon.
Looking for an alternative to staying on Lombok and the Gili Islands. Wanting a nice beach not over populated with tourists on Bali.
What about Uluwatu Omnia ? Was it affected by earthquake?
"Don't worry, Bali is very safe to visit."
How Is Nusa Lembongan
Wondering the same. We are due to fly out on the 18th Aug. and were planning on traveling to Bali- Nusa Lembongan- Gilis- and then Komodo National Park via overnight boat around the islands. We will cancel the Gili islands but does anyone have any advice on Nusa Lembongan or Komodo? Trying to figure out if we should cancel all and just stay on the main island of Bali. Mind you we will be there for 3 weeks and don’t intend on leaving Bali until 26th Aug. Thanks in advanceEdited: 2 years ago 
"I just got back the other day after 2 weeks and 2 earthquakes. I would not hesitate to return and in fact, have just booked my mother in for a 10 day vacation in Bali starting 30th August."
"We decided to travel too, will be there on the 11th !!"

"Hi @TanviM24, I will be travelling to Bali on 23rd Aug, please keep us updated how is it going there."
"Hi, I intend to leave to Bali tomorrow night. Seeing how most of these messages are two days old, I was wondering if anyone here has changed their minds and think it is unsafe to go. Thanks in advance."
Other threads on this forum contain current postings from people already on holidays. The situation in Bali remains okay. I’m flying out on Monday for a week’s stay.
"Hello, I would so appreciate if you would be able to help answer these concerns, is Bali is fully functional at the moment? is the situation in Lombok so extensive that the local focus in Bali is on helping?! Are resources like temporary shelter are needed for residents of Lombok? Are there any new predictions of earthquake, after effects or tsunami’s in the next two months? Has the earthquake effected pollution of the oceans around Bali? Any help you could give would be so helpful"
"Bali functional - yes.focus in Bali helping Lombok - many charities are offering aid. Tourism and life in Bali goes on a usual.It is impossible to predict earthquakes. Indonesia is on the ring of fire, earthquakes are to be expected.The earthquake in Lombok has not polluted the ocean around Bali."
"Hi, hope you had a safe flight! I am also planning my honeymoon in ubud & nusa dua on 27th of august, and the recent events made me curious where to change or not. Kindly advise us on the ground situations and if we should continue our plans or change ?"

"Same here !!! I am also planning my honeymoon in ubud & nusa dua on 27th of august, and the recent events made me curious whether to change or not. Kindly advise us on the ground situations and if we should continue our plans or change ?"
"My wife and I are also thinking about canceling due to the earthquakes. We head to Bali on Sept 4th and the last week of our vacation will be on the coast in Legian. I've been looking forward to this trip for months now, but also I don't want to risk our lives. Just worried about tsunamis. Hopefully in the next few weeks everything settles down. Also wondering with the thousands of people that were affected by the earthquakes and left homeless, I wonder if Bali will have a influx of people to that island. I guess and hopefully we'll find out soon. Safe travels everyone!"
We too are heading to Kuta for our honeymoon and are concerned. Any advice appreciated???
Please read the earthquake thread and ask questions there.https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29…
"Hi I understand you are arriving today, can you please let me know what the situation is on the ground we are planning to fly to Bali on the 27th"
"Faith B, best you take the advice offered by cbimages in post #31 and read through current responses in that link. Cheers"
We are heading to ubud & legion 1st sept. After reading comments feel confident
"Hi,Yes, Bali is still functional at the moment. It is not as crowded as 2 weeks ago. However,g restaurants, stores, hotels are still operating normally. There could be some minor damages on hotel buildings that you want to check out first.No news about temporary shelters in Bali. Some of people in lombok go to their families in other island or town. I am looking for that information too as my place will be empty next week.People still work as usual in Denpasar. Even if they want to help, it's gonna be difficult to spare the time :)The last aftershock happened around 17 hours ago, 4,.. SR. Perhaps there will be more aftershocks in the future wih less intensity. Tsunami can happen if... The earthquake is >7SR.I dunno about the pollution in ocean related to this earthquake. I havent been to the beach since earthquake."
"I will be travel on 18/8 May I know how the condition at Bali , it is ok"
Hi may I know how the condition? I will travel with family on next week 18th
"No one knows what the 18th May holds. Please read the latest from 100's of comments, there is so much information."
How's the situation? We are traveling tomorrow morning from Langkawi...

Sorry wrong threadEdited: 2 years ago 
Is it affects travel to Bali staying in seminyak on the 20th august
"hi, I just came back from bali (kuta). Everything was perfect just that during 9 Aug, there's earthquake on Lombok island, magintute 6.2. I was in the hotel room at that moment and i felt the whole room shaking including the bed, for a couple of seconds. A lot of ppl were screaming and ran out of their hotel room. I was one of the last few to leave the hotel room and ran down the lobby to wait for further instructions. Many visitors were crowding there and talking about how they feel during that moment. Few minutes later, someone mentioned that there's earthquake in Lombok, that's why somehow we got affected as well. The staff mentioned that it's normal to feel aftershock once in awhile but it's our first time experiencing it, moreover it's just a while after we check-in our hotel. I think it's okay to travel to bali as it wouldn't trigger earthquake other than the aftershock. I'm just afraid that all these earthquakes that occur within Indonesia may trigger tsunami. And if there's tsunami, people in bali especially those areas near the sea (e.g. Kuta), will get affected first."
What is the present situation there?
"Manasvi P, please read this and ask your questions on this threadhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29…"
Did you go ? Was everything safe?
I was just there for 10 days and it was fabulous. No worries in Seminyak or Ubud.
"Everything in Seminyak, Kuta, Ubud and surrounding areas are perfect."
"Hi,Even i am planning a trip to ubud and semniyak in 1st week December,I have already booked everything but worried after reading tsunami and earthquake news everyday. How safe is it? I am quite worried."
Get a map and check out where Sulawesi is in relation to Bali.(Hint: it's quite a long way).
Yes. The serve weather isn't close to those areas. About 50 to 60 hours away.
Hi guys I'm traveling on Nov 24-29.. hope things are fine in bali and especially the volcano eruption one.. guys anyone here visited just few days back?? How is the place
How was your trip? All of u safe???
Any Updates?
Updates on what exactly please Asela?
No news is good news...if theres not a mountain of questions here then nothing is going on
"planning to goto Tamansari Jivva Resort, Bali, Pantai Lepang on January. Looking for current status of this Volcano or avoid this area and staying south?"
"Which is ""this"" volcano you want status of? Mt Agung remains at level 3 with an exclusion zone of 4km. There are no alerts for Mt Batur. Or do you have concerns about Mt Rinjani?"
Im planning this December to Bali! Is it safe? Kindly reply
"Ramesh, no one can tell you what might happen in December in Bali, or anywhere else in the world. So sorry, but it is impossible to answer your question."
"Ramesh this is truly amazing!! You can't do research yourself and you ask people on a forum instead? There have been about a thousand answers to this question before which you haven't bothered to check and have only picked out a question from August and not bothered reading the answers to that one as well. However, I will answer it myself. There was a huge earthquake and tsunami which wiped out Bali completely. Bali has ceased to exist, so best to stay home and worry about travelling from there!!Edited: 1 year ago "
"Last night completley sober I tripped on uneven ""footpath"" fell forwards really spectacularly today my knee is sore can't surf couple days at least...It's unsafe here"
"Hi, i am reading posts from August, and now wondering about Japanese mosquito bites. Can someone advise please is there epidemic situation or only in rural areas? We should go on the 1 st Jan 2019.Thanks"
Have you read this thread?https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29…
Yet another shallow depth earthquake was felt in South Bali this morning ( becoming more prevalent in the region ).... luckily no Tsunami occurred.
"DuskaMy advice is to do your research into what vaccinations are recommended for a trip to Bali (JE vac is suggested for UK travellers if your trip meets certain criteria) then go see your GP.At the same time, research the prevalence of JE in Bali (if you can find specific figures for Bali) or Indonesia if you can't and decide if:you still want to travel without JE vaccinationyou want to have the JE vaccinationyou want to cancel your trip"
"Japanese Mosquitos have invaded Bali?After what I saw in the Pizzeria on Gili T tonight ""Japanese Encephalitis"" must be something to do with instagramming your pizza and pasta then covering it in Soy sauce.Just wondering if you can substitute other nationals. I wonder what ""Aussie Encephalitis"" would be. Is Dr Gregg in the house."
Is it safe to travel to Bali in January?
"Absolutely, what exactly are you worried about ? Mosquitoes, volcanoes, geckos, earthquakes, monkeys, tsunamis, dogs, humidity, bag snatches, contaminated water, snakes, overflowing sewage.You could experience one, none, some or all of the above, yet the chances of having a great time in Bali is more than likely."
"Like Janice said, it is currently safe, but anything can happen anytime in indonesia, remember they are on the ring of fire.But you have 99 chances on 100 that everything go well."
