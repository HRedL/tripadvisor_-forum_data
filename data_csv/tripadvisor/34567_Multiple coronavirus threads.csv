"Certainly on the Europe boards, and I suspect most other parts of the world as well, there are repeated new threads along the lines of ""What's happening in X, and should I cancel my trip?""Please could the moderators pick one for each country and make it a sticky to avoid further multiplication? Call it a containment strategy."
"HiGood idea but even with a Sticky people are still going to post new threads. Personally, I cannot see TA doing thisYes it can be annoying to see multiple threads on the same topic but this is nothing new as you see it all the time on some forums where you have tropical storms or hurricanesHere on the Support Forum / HUMTAB from time to time you see multiple threads asking people to boycott TA or when there has been a change to the websiteSuch is life on a forum"
"Good idea but can't see it working. Hardly anyone seems to see or read stickies. Also many of these posts are created by trolls. They can easily reword them so they won't be deleted. The other problem some countries have numerous sub forums, so some don't even visit the main country forum, they may just post on one sub forum."
"I see there is new travel notice regarding coronavirus on the opening page of all TA forums.Edited: 9:32 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Is there? Not seen it.OK I see it now, I think that if anything will just encourage more posting about it.Edited: 9:47 am, March 07, 2020 "
Only on the full TA site is it showing just checked the TA mobile site and of course it does not show there. Angie
ArielIf you click on Tripadvisor's Forums in the blue highligted link 'Follow the latest traveler discussions on COVID-19 in Tripadvisor’s Forums ' it takes you to ALL the threads on Coronovius across the TA site. But as you say folk still will not trawl through all the current 34 pages of threads and read them they will just open a new thread.Angie.
Well done TA
"Had a look at that notice and there are at least 10 posts on the first few pages for Thailand. Not sure this is going to help or not but there are new posts all the time, apart from that subject the forums are almost dead."
"Bellagio #3,Yes, on Safari/iPad and full dot com Website, I am seeing that link on most forum pages, in bright orange, with a link to: https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019Hunt"
"Ariel-ScarlettThey also recommended other things as wellThere is currently no vaccine against COVID-19. To protect yourself against infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends:Washing your hands regularly with an alcohol-based sanitizerMaintaining distance of at least 1 metre (3 feet) between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezingAvoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouthSeeking medical care immediately if you are showing symptomsWhat did you expect them to recommend at this stage?Edited: 11:33 am, March 07, 2020 "
"WHO could have included advice about washing your hands with soap and water. IMO, WHO is not the most Average Joe/Jane friendly website. The CDC may be more informative for the general population. They say, in part:""Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.""Link to full page on Prevention and Treatment"":https:/…prevention-treatment.html"
Yesterday I was talking to a nurse friend of ours who was saying how sore her hands were getting with all the washing of hands she was having to do in addition to her normal in between patient hygiene
Perhaps someone can repeatedly point people at the top banner about it - so cutting out some of the banter?I thought it was particularly good. Shows each countrys number of cases updated. If you want to know more you should really research.People do tend to like to think that their question is different to others. I'm not sure you'll ever change that.When other disasters occour it tends to be one thread only so all the info is in one place. Good idea but leads to a lot of indignation of 'my post was closed' etc. This is unusual because it's not just one country to control. It's the whole world so without more staff to deal with merging threads etc not sure what they can do.
"Toopaz #15,I have done so, on several Destination Forums I frequent, where there have been Covid threads.Not sure how many have bothered to read, or to follow the TA link?Still, likely a step in the right direction, or so I hope.Hunt"
"The WHO site is about 1 day out of date, I find this site better: https:/…countries"
"WHO does advice washing with soap and water, that's why I was baffled by the ""wash with sanitizer""."
WHO posts the hand washing advice in the page about Advice for Public.https:/…advice-for-public
There is a new member on the Cruises forum with 65 posts this month and every one of them is about the virus.It is just bizarre.
"Even more Coronavirus posts on the Thailand forum, most getting closed down but some previously closed ones have reopened."
"Traveller, I've too noticed something similar... people come out of the woodwork."
Ariel.You do wonder what their motive can be!
"Some are trolls, some are anti that country. I see many first time poster starting negative posts about Coronavirus. No doubt many of them have just set up new profiles and have existing profiles on TA."
I think you are right about the trolls Stingray.
Yes it is very sad that situation like this bring out the troll who just want to spread their mis-informationHaving said that I have seen quite a few rather hysterical posts from regular users
"There is a lot of hysterical nonsense in the media, so it's not surprising that it appears here as well."
under the be CAREFUL what you read. Under the Orange Button TA can no even get the washing your hands to match what the agencies like CDC recommend )-: They also include Travel Advisory for the US using the White House info which has politicized this whole thing so that the numbers look good rather then dealing with the health recommendations based on experience developed from the other countries. That Orange Button if it is going to be useful need to have the facts not Alternate Facts.
"Of course the coronavirus is a big concern and a concern for travelers. If you don't want to read it, just scroll by. People have an interest in what's going on in the destination where they are going, are thinking about going so I hope the threads get reinstated and the others just scroll on by."
Just because people don't like trolling or a hundred identical threads flooding the forums doesn't mean they're not concerned or interested in the destination.
Now here are even more as some of the removed posts have returned.
