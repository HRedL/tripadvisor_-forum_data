"Vietnam Airlines policy:https://www.vietnamairlines.com/~/media/Files/VNANew/Travel%20Information/Covid-19/20200316_en_ticket_change_and_refund_covid19.pdfNot sure that VietJet have put anything out. They're on 19001886@vietjetair.comIf you can get refunded, you should fall back on your travel insurance."
Just incase if you didn’t buy insurance; just keep calling to the airline and explain your concerns. Many are very aware of the situation and likely and willing to work with you if not all refunds back. I had some refunds when I canceled my flight sgn to cnx last month and wasn’t expecting at all.
"In March, the situation of Covid 19 epidemic in Vietnam in general and Hanoi in particular was happening quite complicatedly, so flights were almost canceled. If you book a flight with Vietnam Airlines and the flight is canceled due to the Covid 19 epidemic, then you will be refunded to your bank account after 3 months. You can contact Vietnam Airlines hotline 19001100 for assistance.Information to you!"
"No i was going in april and travel insurance will not cover as they have a pandemic so we are out of pocket for vietjet and most things that didnt have cFree cancelation our flights in sydney got canceled one week before we were due to fly ,so international carrier gave us a credit not a refund"
