"I booked a hotel in Philadelphia which was in the historic district and a historic building. I received a confirmation from Getaroom (I thought I was booking via TA). I was then told the hotel was overbooked and given two alternatives. Not as convenient but both near the historic district. I agreed to one (and, if not, the other). After pressing for confirmation, I was told (as we were pulling in to Philadelphia) that a room was booked mid town in a large impersonal hotel. Getaroom were slow and unhelpful. The final straw was saying they will pay for a cab and then not paying for the tip. Small point but typical of the entire episode. I c aution against using Getaroom under any circumstances and caution against using TA as they won't help me resolve my issue. The only offer is repeated requests to review the hotel I wanted in the first place. Very frustrating."
"""I received a confirmation from Getaroom (I thought I was booking via TA). ""Yes, you were booking exactly like that via TripAdvisor not booking with TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor only acts as a platform for getaroom booking.com and others, including hotel websites, to book without leaving TripAdvisor. That's all.Still, did you tell TripAdvisor what went on? Did you complain directly to them about getaroom? Maybe you need to do that so that TripAdvisor can mediate between you and getaroom.You can contact the staff on this issue by going to the Help Center. Go to www.tripadvisor.com/generalsupport Click on My User Account, then select Hotel Bookings.Silvia"
I have told TA what happened. They refused to list my review. No other attempt to contact me. I will try again via the link you mention but I am very unhappy that I have to make all the running when a complaint has been made. This applies to Getaroom and TA.
"""They refused to list my review"" -Tripadvisor does not have listings so people can review Online Booking websites, such as Getaroom or any others. There are listings for Accommodation, Dining venues, Attractions and Airlines."
"Hello pearlfan,Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and we truly apologize for the situation you faced with Getaroom. Someone from our team will be reaching out to you privately.-MollieTripAdvisor Staff"
"Most unfortunate.The problem faced by many consumers, is the often mistaken belief that all OTA's operate similar/same business models, when in fact it's not the case at all. There are many different business models, some which have direct distribution directly with the hotels, whilst many others source the products from wholesalers, bedbanks, and other agents. So effectively, these agents aren't selling inventory they have access to - which is why bookings seemingly become unavailable or apparently overbooked. Basically put, they never had it in the first place, and you didn't purchase anything from them, you merely purchased a request to *source* a product.The key is to read the T&C's of each agent thoroughly and carefully, to understand how they operate. Below is from the T&C's of Getaroom;""Travel Agent is not involved in providing actual airfare, cruises, hotel rooms, room service, valet parking, meals, any food products, and/or tickets of any sort. As a result, Travel Agent has no control over, and makes no representations regarding, the quality, safety or legality of the products and services offered, food provided, accommodations provided, and/or the truth or accuracy of the listings or the ability of the vendors to offer services""The advice here is to research carefully - and there is a plethora of threads on Getaroom on the forums. It's of little consolation now, but hopefully you'll have a better understanding for future travels.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Went thru Trip Advisor to book room at Hyatt Regency Orlando for four days. As going thru booking process with GetARoom watched for any mention of additional charges such as parking or other fees hotels love to charge these days as this is almost pure profit for them. After not seeing any mention of these fees finished booking. When arrived to hotel found they had book two rooms as I had only requested one, ok that was easy to fix. Then at end of stay I found I had been charged additional fees for resort and overnight parking adding an extra $127.80 to pay above what I had already paid for room. After getting home I checked paperwork to see if I had missed something but all it said on confirmation sheet was total charge $xxx.xx. I then thought to look at their Terms and found this ""20.Charges NOT Paid by Travel AgentUpon check-in at a hotel or for a cruise, customer acknowledges that customer will be required by the cruise line or hotel to provide a credit card to cover any incidental expenses that are incurred by the customer at any time during the stay. These expenses include, but are not limited to, room service, meals, valet parking, additional hotel taxes, internet fees, beverage fees, spa services, picture purchases, and any other fees associated or incidentals with staying at any particular hotel and/or traveling on any particular cruise line.""This gets them out of this type of practice and lets them show rates below what you would see from other sites which include the information they don't."
"Unfortunately your complaint makes zero sense.>>>20.Charges NOT Paid by Travel AgentUpon check-in at a hotel or for a cruise, customer acknowledges that customer will be required by the cruise line or hotel to provide a credit card to cover any incidental expenses that are incurred by the customer at any time during the stay. These expenses include, but are not limited to, room service, meals, valet parking, additional hotel taxes, internet fees, beverage fees, spa services, picture purchases, and any other fees associated or incidentals with staying at any particular hotel and/or traveling on any particular cruise line.""<<<Why did you not check the T&C's before you booked, instead of after your travel? Do you understand the definition of the word incidental?>>>This gets them out of this type of practice and lets them show rates below what you would see from other sites which include the information they don't<<<Incidental charges have nothing to do with advertising room rates. How does an agency charge you before you incur incidental charges? Let's give a real basic example. How do you pay for room service in advance when you haven't used them yet? Room Service is incidental. How do you pay for telephone calls you haven't made yet? Telephone calls are incidental. How do you pay for valet parking you haven't used yet? Valet parking is incidental,The hotel is responsible for ensuring any additional charges or fees are mentioned. So this has nothing to do with Getaroom.I have no hesitation shooting down OTA's and businesses in the industry for poor practice, but not for reasons where the consumer has no understanding of the agreement they have entered into.I believe it's time this thread is either shut down or relocated.Edited: 4 years ago "
