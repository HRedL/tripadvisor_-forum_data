"You probably won’t have any issues. Just be sure to have a contingency plan. In addition to taking extra medication, be sure to bring a credit card with a high limit in case you can’t get back into the country, are hospitalized, etc. Also make sure your obligations at home can be met if you have a long delay getting home."
