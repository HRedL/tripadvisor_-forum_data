"Hello fellow travelers!Due to the Covid-19 is anyone slightly stranded in Vietnam, Hanoi or Vietnam in general?Watching the gradual decline of tourism here and almost being outcasted. I’m being denied hotels and restaurants, pretty hostile in Hanoi right now. With boarders being all locked-up and obviously not being able to leave to another, I’m just curious to hear if anyone is in the same boat...Cheers again!"
"I wouldn’t be surprised to encounter hostile during critical time; indeed anyone will put their nation’s interest first, foreigners will be in last. If I were you I would leave ASAP. Heard about recent a western YouTube blogger kicked out from air bnb during nation locked down in friendly Italy?Edited: 2:27 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"UK FCO saying make arrangements to come home while it's still possible.https:/…vietnam> If you’re visiting Vietnam and intend to return to the UK, you’re advised to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible. The number of international flights out of Vietnam is reducing rapidly as a result of travel restrictions in the region and globally."
"Tony A Go home, AustrLia has advised it citizens not to trawl any where and to get home ASAP ..Qantas has reduced its international flights by 90% Soon you won't be able to get out..take this seriously."
"Well the Australians similarly sayhttps:/…vietnam> If you are already overseas and wish to return to Australia, we recommend you do so as soon as possible by commercial means."
"In a matter of a week or so, posts have gone from shall we go, to shall we go home?If I was an expat with a family or a good circle of friends I might stay rather, but short term visitors should be gone by now."
"> In a matter of a week or so, posts have gone from shall we go, to shall we go home?Give it a few days and it will be ""How can I get home?""And a few days later, ""I can't get home!""I'd be getting out now while it's still possible."
"IAnybody with a bit of commonsense would have been making arrangements to get home last week, or even the week before that. Within a few days the ones who thought they knew best will be crying on forums like this that they are stranded with no way to get home. It’s about engaging your brain and taking the relevant action, instead some constantly need their hands holding and whinge like big babies when things go belly up."
"Hi we are in isolation in a hotel in Hanoi we arrived on the 8th/9th march on a flight from London. VN54 an air hostess has been tested as positive for covid 19> we have been in isolation since then (13th) we aren't allowed out of room and have spoken to consulate etc. my worry is by the time we are let out ( we tested negative but still in isolation) there wont be any flights, how are you getting on?"
only wish we could good luck we are isolated so cant move
"well that is a great attitude we are in isolation the Vietnam government have us locked in hotel, we cnt just walk out we want to but that's just not possible we have been told we will not be allowed to leave as passports blocked. thanks for your support here we cant Get Out > ok for u saying folk are moaning and need handholding you try our situation and see what u would do"
"Why didn't you go. Home earlier this has been going on and getting steadily worse but people are still going to travel, ...so now all hell lets loose and you can't get out. No surprises there."
"Just flew home yesterday and currently under 14 days home quarantine. Was suppose to fly out on 20th March, but was given very short notice on 17th March that Sapa will be on lockdown, to leave by midnight or be quarantine in Sapa. I cut short my trip, and flew out.Vietnam is taking very drastic measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. Flights are very much reduced. For those still decided to stay, be prepared for the worst."
"A few are stubborn....and till stepping into deep water and crying for helps..it’s been warned late February. Probably and maybe last hope is contact your embassy and plead for your case before total lock down and flight(s) is still available to your home.Wish you the best luck!Edited: 12:49 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Hi Karen,We returned from Vietnam last night after almost a month there. We were 2 nights shy of our intended vacation when our local guide said we should leave.Very sorry to hear your dilemma, it must be incredibly stressful for you. People saying you shouldn't have gone aren't much of a help! For the few that have been unfortunately 'isolated' many, many more have had wonderful trips, It's just unfortunate that you were on the wrong flight, it equally could have been us. When you travelled there was no way of knowing how this would unfold. A lot of people are in the same boat as you. The Vietnamese have been taking what seems to many as drastic steps to try and stem the spread of this virus.Where are you in Vietnam? We spent 4 nights in Hoi an, I know 4 people in our hotel were still in isolation for 14 days after being on that flight. Not sure if it's you or someone else. I spoke briefly to a lady from a distance as she was putting a tray out for collection as no housekeeping was allowed to enter the room food was delivered on paper plates.I hope you get home soon."
"I don't see how it's extreme to forcibly quarantine all international travelers (Vietnamese and foreigners) when we know that self quarantine isn't effective because people keep violating it. The country was free of any cases for more than three weeks after its 16th case, and while there is still the chance to prevent community spread I don't see how any possible action can be anything but reasonable. I'm sorry if you're stranded here away from family. Life is still pretty great because while engaging in social distancing you can still order delicious food from Grab or Now.vn. Hanoi is a pretty great city to be stranded in. You may encounter discrimination as a foreigner due to western governments' lack of a response to covid-19, but as of a few days ago they will enforce punishments to those businesses should you report it. While hostels have closed (and good, you shouldn't be sharing a room with strangers during these times), you should still be able to find hotels."
another speculator!
"yes, it is happening. Hanoi has only been open to westerners in the last few years. i used to experience that animosity when i first traveled there. but there is another factor in play. The social media in ASia is promoting a conspiracy theory blessed by China that blame the virus outbreak on the US, saying that it started with us military athletes competing in Wuhan. i am in Cambodia now....a colony of China, in reality, and the theory is widely accepted. it took hold after Trump began calling the virus the China virus. He has made travel in Asia much more difficult.Edited: 12:17 pm, April 02, 2020 "
suggest you look to airbnb
I feel for you. We were tgere recently just got a very expensive flight out the night before Australia closed borders.we were googling the whole time. Called the consulate who couldnt tell us anything and the local tour operators were telling us its fine etc. Tours were cancelling as we made our way south to get closer to HCM where we were flying out. We were treated disgustingly at the very beginning of our trip at the bus station where our booked and paid ticket was not honoured. After a local in Hanoi helped we got to the North to do the loop where people were nicer other than Da Nang. The whlle trip was ruined to the point i have no interest in going back and fear or no fear there was no reason to be treated like crap. The virus started in a wet market in China it is not our fsult these countries are not being educated on the truth. With incorrect and minimal cimmunication i can see how you ended up in this situation and i really hope things get better for you
> Hanoi has only been open to westerners in the last few years.DECADES.
"""yes, it is happening. Hanoi has only been open to westerners in the last few years...""Please take your ignorant and false beliefs elsewhere. Thank you in advance,Scott"
cathnniv M The virus started in a wet market in China it is not our fsult these countries are not being educated on the truth.--------------No one really knows where it came from or how it crossed over to humans ..... https:/…200317175442.htm
"Ive been called some awful names recently saying that there is no absolute proof it came from China. Scientists are saying its evolved from other viruses found in camels in the ME.And Ive said it before, its pointless blaming a race for a virus.It will infect any human. Be wary of right wing conspiracies spreading false information."
They are extremely happy to tske tourists money when times are good if they want this to continue they should treat tourists better in bad times. Some operators were amazing which made it more hurtful when they were rude
The Australian government needed to advise travellers better throughout this. Travel with caution was the ruling up until very late
I'd have thought it obvious that things were going to change rapidly i.e. China. One reason I decided way back in early February that going to Vietnam much before July wasn't on - we were looking at the Easter break (have a very frail mother-in-law who we really would like to see again). And that was just by reading the news. Most governments around the globe are playing catch up. And what does 'travel with caution' mean. It means keeping an eye on what is happening and having a plan B or even C. It certainly doesn't mean carry on as before. Unfortunately some will always blame others for their own shortcomings. What has happened has happened - live with it.
"There have been warned Zillion, Brazilian times here on TA forums; some jokes about accidents on roads kills more or flu kills whatever; still it doesn’t bother to some egomaniacs ....well.. what is next?"
"We cut our trip short leaving 21/03 when our flight from Hanoi was cancelled and Australia announced 14 day quarantine on return. When we were in Da Nang we kept monitoring what was going on. I did try to change flight again but they were either heavily booked or connecting flights were not available. As it turned out we got one of the last direct flights back, there were people on standby, but there were still quite a few empty seats.While it was a little stressful we enjoyed our holiday. We travelled because the our government had not issued a do not travel. We looked at risks there were less cases of the virus in Vietnam than Australia. My main worry was being caught up in quarantine and not getting home, I feel sorry for anyone that has happened too.Vietnam has been proactive, I read they are selling test kits to European countries and have a high rate of testing. when we retuned home they didn’t even check our temperature."
You still have to do 14 days in quarantine though.
"As previously says, you still have a civic duty to quarantine yourself. If you look at Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar such neighboring countries seem to have no reports or whatsoever doesn’t necessarily mean their govnt doing excellent jobs to prevent covid19, just like you have mentioned Australia government is not warning to the travelers ahead of time; it is not a time to play blame game on any one but cooperate and work together, get butt out of country and go home ASAP. Do you ever wonder why we always call “home sweet home”?"
"Now, you can move, have fun, eat and rest easily in Hanoi then. Because the Covid 19 epidemic is now in Hanoi in particular and Vietnam in general has been well controlled.However, you still need to improve the prevention of Covid 19!"
Hi I have been stranded in vietnam since March with 3 flights cancelled since then. I am trying to get back to Australia. Can anyone help with flights comming up ? I have followed embassy suggested flights but all are fully booked or cancelled and land borders are closed. Any information would be a help. Thankyou.
"> stranded in vietnamIt's more ""locked out of Australia"". https:/…6887b28152d0241abb1df9664f6b7264I don't think there's any magic that guarantees to get you home quickly. Register with the consulate and keep trying is pretty much all you can do."
