I read on the CDC website that they recommend vaccinations for hepatitis A and typhoid fever for travelers to Chile. Does this hold true if just traveling to the airport and Portillo and back?
There was an epidemic of Typhoid Fever in the 1970s and 1980s. Current levels are very low. I would not be vaccinated.In general levels of health in Chile are similar to other industrialized countries.
"Our Department for Foreign Affairs recommend for Chile:Tetanus, Diphtherie, Pertussis, Mumps, Measles, Pneumokokken, Influenza, Hepatitis A.But these are the standard immunisation in Germany and everybody should have it anyway. (only Hepatitis A is not necessary in Germany and therefore no standard)Beate"
As in North America and Europe Hepatitis A is largely restricted to homosexual men.
"welcome,what it comes down to is that you need to have a personal chat with your doctor and let them know your concerns. They will have your health records and be able to give you information.what happens is that people are short sighted and they dont think about ""tomorrow"" and if they will be traveling in the future and where it maybe needed.good luck"
