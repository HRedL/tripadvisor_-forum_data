"hi guys,i am planning to fly from UK to HK next week via dubai with emirates, i saw they have stopped issuing visas on arrivals, but i dont believe i need any sort of visa?can anyone confirm?thanks"
No need if you stay in transit area.
no flights to hong kong until further notice its on their cancellation list .
No emirates flights full stop
It’s a UAE stop for all passenger flights - including transit. Comes into effect 25/3.
"yeah changed from not yesterday to it will be operating but on a demand option , so if know one on the flight or much cargo or a few it could be suspended at will. no one is going to fly in empty planes ."
Again Lovedogs please get your facts right. Passenger flights from 25/03 only at foreign government repatriation request
well clearly the thread i read has since changed since various changes of yesterday.
