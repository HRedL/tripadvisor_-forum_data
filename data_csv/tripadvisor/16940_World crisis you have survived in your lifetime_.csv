"I've been reminded during this time of the number of crisees I've (so far) lived through.The first of mine was spending my teens expecting global destruction from the Atom Bomb as a real threat to my future or lack of. There were public service announcements, bunkers built in the countryside for council members & politicians and we were told to just Duck and Cover! Yes really.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMnKNHNfznEIn my 20's went through the power strikes where we never knew from day to day whether we'd have light or heat. That's when most people in the UK turned to gas which couldn't be turned off.In my 40's there was a major recession resulting in people loosing their jobs and, with government restructuring, their careers. I took another form of work and it was another recession and the worst weather for 300yrs so that went by the by.My 30's there was a TB outbreak from people travelling abroad, measles, polio etc. Where people had become complacent about innoculationIn my 50's there was Sar's a relative of this virus, then Bird Flu ditto, the banking crash. Lost my work just before retirement, my retirement trip never happened but I eventually scraped into pension time though it took ages to life to reestablish.And then Ebola. Again, largely people travelling.But so far, here to tell the tale.Each time the country/world has recovered. Not sure about Global warming which has worryingly been on the agenda since my teens.........it's happening but so far London isn't underwater yet so differently to originally predicted.So what are your tales of crisees during your lifetime?Edited: 7:58 am, May 03, 2020 "
What about the millennium when all the computers and everything that relied on them were supposed to stop working.
"Let's be honest. There hasn't been any really serious crisis in Europe since WW2 till this one. My parents went through WW2, my father was even a war prisoner in Germany (not for long), he even went through WW1 as well but he was just a young kid then."
Ha!Ha! Yes Raymond. Can you imagine what the world would make of that if it was suggested now?
I remember the duck and cover film being shown in our school and we all had to practice hiding under the desk.Those desks were pretty sturdy but not sure they were designed to resist a nuclear blast.
I remember when Take That spilt and the ensuing crisis as to who would take their mantle
https:/…current-time
"This is the only world crisis that I've experienced. I remember the school practices for nuclear bombs, but luckily I was young enough not to be aware of what the consequences of a bomb would be & felt quite sure that taking shelter in the school basement was going to save us."
"Gen ex, in Canada. World crisis, maybe not. Things that affected our family, October Crisis, Mass exodus from Quebec, AIDs, and the financial crash of 2008.We all thought that the Russians and the US. were gonna nuke everybody so we just kept dancing and having reckless sex cuz really all we worried about was getting pregnant and there was a pill for that, and then that became dangerous."

"Ehm, this and the 2008 one.Not a world crisis, but the 2011 Garbage crisis in Naples has been for sure a traumatic event. And my parents went through the cholera epidemic in the early '70s, which affected the most of Southern Italy and was the last (so far?) cholera epidemic in Europe."
"Nothing of this scope.Probably the closest was the “Cuban Missile Crisis,” but that was fairly quick.Next closest was likely, the Korean War, Vietnam Nam, and the Gulf Wars.Locally, gasoline shortages in the 1970’s, and of course various hurricanes, but nothing like this, by quite a bit.Hunt"
9/11 was quite traumatic but nothing to compare to this.
"I, also, remember the grade school drills of crawling under our desks. ,Now, not at all a world crisis, but the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens did require us in the Pacific NW to wear masks, plus drive cars really slowly to avoid stirring up the ash. I remember having to rinse off the car every day as the glass in the ash was destructive to the paint, plus protecting anything with motors or like that from clogging. Anyway, the mask wearing just reminded me of that time. Many deaths from the eruption, However the amount of deaths with the current event is staggering :("
I was young at the time of the Cuban missile crisis but reading about it and watching things on tv it was literally only seconds away from nuclear war that would have killed millions.
"My late mother always used to complain about the world going to ruin and how things were the worst they ever were. Which was weird considering she lived in China and Hong Kong during the Japanese Invasion, and the civil war between the communists and nationalists, and lost a number of relatives to these events."
"I would consider this covid pandemic my first. There were other events like the Vietnam War and 9/11 but they did not personally effect me in a way I can honestly say that I ""survived"" them."
"On a global scale? Just this.Everything was more localized events 9/11 happened, but I lived in Texas. There was hardly anything to 'survive' there. The shuttle Challenger blew up, on TVThere were various outbreaks of ebola, swine flu, bird flu, but none were really a global crisis. The 2008 crash was probably the worst thing."
"Just this current pandemic. Other things went on around me, a big distance away, like various flus and diseases but none affected me. The stock mkt crash in 2008 did damage to my investments but they came back and increased."
"Definition of World Crisis differ.I'm 63. I missed WWII. I'm not sure anything else has risen to that level before now.As it is, I'm trying to survive my 1st two.COVID-19Trump"
I think this was a world crisis.https:/…
"I remember people being very scared of polio in the 50s. I actually knew someone who contracted it but they survived, albiet with a limp. Fortunately a vaccination was found and we had ours at primary school but it was certainly a very scary time. The Cuban Missile Crisis. Another scary time when the world waited to see what would happen.I was born towards the end of WW2 so cannot remember anything of those days. Likewise the Korean War. We knew it was happening but were relatively unaffected at our young ages. The Vietnam War was a bit closer to home in that we knew many young men who fought over there.The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was big but fortunately my husband and I came through it relatively unscathed. We had just retired too. Great financial adviser.But this one, IMO, tops the lot. Never in all my years have I ever experienced living like this and hope, in the years I have left, never to see the likes of it again.Edited: 2:14 am, May 13, 2020 "
"I either went through or witnessed some world crisis, however I would not go as far as saying I survived any of them.Vietnam War- I remember, as a child, ducking under the bed when hearing the siren in the middle of the night, or how to use a wet towel over the nose to mitigate the effects of tear gas. I remember moving to another country after my father was released from a ""re-education camp"". I remember my parents working hard to give us a more promising future. And life moved on.9/11- The Pentagon, which is about 30 minutes from my house, got hit while I was on vacation in Greece. My return flight landed on the first day when the US was open to international flights. It was a scary and sad time! 2008 Financial Crisis- Minor impact so recovery was pretty much painless. SARS, Ebola- We followed their development on the news, but no direct impact.Coronavirus- The way this whole thing is affecting our everyday life seems very trivial compared to how it is impacting the life of millions of other people who got sick, lost their loved ones to Cover-19, lost their jobs,... We can only hope that, sooner rather than later, we will overcome this one too!"
