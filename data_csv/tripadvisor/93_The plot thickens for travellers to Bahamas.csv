https://www.bahamas.com/tourism-reopeningNo commercial America flights
"The plot is pretty simple -- no mystery there. Due to rising numbers fo cases in the US, the Bahamas has simply closed our borders to US travellers -- as have many others countries, including Canada. International flights from Canada, the UK, and the EU are still permitted -- just no flights from the US or US citizens. This takes effect at midnight, Wednesday, July 22nd."
Commercial flights Private planes boats still allowed I’m told
"Yes, that is my understanding too. But it will bear looking closely at the actual Emergency Orders for clarification on this point."
"Just went back and looked at the national address transcript and it specifically states --Private international flights and charters for Bahamians, residents and visitors will be permitted.Pleasure craft and yachts will also be permitted. It makes no distinction where these private flights or vessels come from, just that all passengers must comply with the travel requirements, including a negative RT-PCR test and the accompanying documentation. This appears to be a loophole of sorts, but the effect is that it drastically reduces numbers of incoming passengers. Yes, the post above suggests there be a way to allow those not living in hot sports entry to the Bahamas -- and you do (see above), but we've already had 100+ people lie and submit false test results.. What's to stop people from claiming they live in East Podunk and really be coming from a hot spot? Many countries have taken the step to ban US travellers, so the Bahamas isn't alone in this - and even offers a small loophole as well."
Just Curious as to what happens Americans already in The Bahamas is there a time they have to leave or can they continue their vacations as normal .
"Hi @donK_00,Outgoing flights will be permitted to accommodate any current visitors scheduled to return to the United States after Wednesday, July 22."

"@DonK ... I’ve been wondering that same thing. Yes, as TheBahamasOutIslands explains, *outgoing* flights from the Bahamas will be allowed. OK, I understand that. But as no travelers will be allowed to arrive on flights from the U.S., are JetBlue, American Airlines, Delta, Silver, et al gonna fly *empty* planes from the U.S. over to NAS and ELH every day, on their regular sked, to bring back their customers who are already in the Bahamas? I don’t know that anybody other than the airlines can answer that question, but I’d be really amazed if it worked out that way. We’ll see, I guess ..."
"I agree, the US airlines are not going to be willing to fly in empty to take a few stragglers home for long. Shortly we will be back to Aztec being the only scheduled flights to the US. If you want off the rock now is the time."
"The Bahamas is planning on exporting all the Americans to Toronto or the UK so they can infect those countries, too. :)Now's the time to plan that little trip to Cuba, no?"
"Gawd, Bret, I was thinkin’ that same thing ... it could reach a point where U.S. tourist refugees hoping to get home realize they might have to fly BahamasAir to Havana or Port au Prince and hope to catch a flight back to the U.S. from there!"
The US/Canada border was just closed to non-essential travel for another month so Toronto won't work either. You could go through London if you quarantine for 2 weeks.
We don’t want them thank you!
You could get a private charter out. I think the Hopper flys to Florida. We’re planning on taking it from Nassau to North E if we can go in Feb. The direct Calgary to Nassau gets us in to late to make it to NE
"I've been checking and there seems to be no direct flights (BA) from UK (London) to Nassau until Sept. there are direct from Toronto , that's all i can find . The only way i can see for Americans who are in The Bahamas now is for a mandatory exit , no hanging around. Now since us Europeans are allowed travel , might be a nice quiet time for my safe return."
Most Americans that go over there go by there own private boat. If the weather is right you can cross in a few hours. More to the Bimini area
"DonK, it would almost be a you can't get there from here scenario! With BA on hiatus, you'd alsmost have to do a Canada flight, then on to the Bahamas. Or even the direct charter from Paris to San Salvador for Club Med (not sure they are even running right now) But, according the US Embassy's health alert email today, there will be empty legs being flown out of the Bahamas back the the US for at least the immediate future. But, as others have pointed out, there's little incentive for them to continue this for long. And the US Embassy has taken a dim view of ""rescuing"" stragglers who don't get outu when they can, then expect the Embassy to accommodate them. Throughout the lockdown from March - July, Jet Blue, Silver Airways, Aztec and United all offered a few odd return flights - all announced in the daily US Embassy email update. I presume it will be the same, but for how long remains to be seen. Domestic travel throughout the Bahamas will continue as is -- subject to the same health visa process. I'd think that, as long as there aren't any cases in the out island, this too will continue. If there are, then expect out island travel to be restricted again. Going for my daily swim now -- have to walk across the rocks, as the beaches are now closed..."
"If any of you Americans brought really good steaks and have to leave, I'll gladly take them off your hands. Same is true for boudin or shell on shrimp 20-25. ;-)"
"“Most Americans that go over there go by there own private boat.” Huh? That’s not even close to true. Most Americans do not own ocean-going yachts. Good grief. The yacht traffic is barely a drop in the ocean, pardon the metaphor, compared to the commercial airline arrivals."
You won’t get anything from anybody. Your pessimism and antagonism towards Americans is disgusting. I bet you are a 5ft bald nothing POS!
That was for dahermit
"I'm really feeling the love on the forums today.Actually I don't think he was referring to you Dave, it's the other American that he is accusing of antagonism towards Americans."
"I'm just trying to be a polite Canadian here, but wasn't it Caicos that was just being antagonistic to Americans?"
"If only he was a hermit, neither heard nor seen. Every message board has trolls who derive their self-worth from irritating everyone else."
"You know, they're right DH! You should gladly be willing to get sick or die for the sake of someone's much needed down time. How dare you be so selfish?! Do you always have to put the welfare of Eleuthera and the Bahamian's lives first?! "
"Roger that, Bret ... and, help me out, I’m havin’ a hard time rememberin’ if any of these knobs donated medical supplies, or school supplies, or baseballs for the youth league, or other charities that the old “troll” was promoting? You? Not to mention the sick or injured or clueless tourists — mostly fellow Americans — he’s rescued over the years. SMH."
The other type that you find on every message board is someone completely devoid of a sense of humour. How could anyone take DH's comment about steaks as anything other than a joke? He even added a ;) for the humour impaired.
Oh the warped irony. How many stupid and stranded Americans has DH safely rescued and helped over the years? Several hundred would be my guess. He deserves all the steaks you can give him! (Though he prefers goat)
DaveI’m talking about guys zipping over in 30 foot cc not yachts. Very popular for people close to Florida to boat over for a few days to enjoy the islands
"Did Bahamian citizens need to have a negative Covid 19 nasal swab test result for re-entry into the Bahamas after visiting the US?Edited: 8:14 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Yes, Westendgirl. All travellers need a negative COVID 19 test. The exception is for Bahamian citizens who are unable to get tested in the US prior to travel. In those cases, they will be permitted to return to the Bahamas, but will be put into a mandatory 2 week quarantine on arrival at a government designated facility (or home, if approved) at their own expense and agree to monitoring via Hubcatt. At the end of 2 weeks, they are tested and must rest negative before being released from quarantine. But if you're from West End GB, I'd think you'd not be able to come back to the Bahamas without a COVID 19 test -- which is why we're in this mess in GB to begin with!! My guess is that with 20 new cases in GB today, that there will be a full lockdown instituted on Friday for GB, as the PM promised in his national address. I also recall that there are no flights into GB either now or within the next few days, so if you're planning to return, you'll need to do so immediately."
Sorry I was referring to the Americans that zip over for a weekend to fish/dive/boat. Very popular on some of the closer islands to Florida. Seems a lot of the ones I meet have there own boat. I feel left out...if thoes darn lotto numbers would ever hit.
"Matt D, so many of those little sport fishing boats plague the Bahamas -- many come over for the day, fish our waters (often ignoring catch limits and closed seasons) and never even bother to clear Bahamas customs or immigration. We don't consider those types of visitors as anything other than criminals and poachers. There are also many who come to the Biminis and Berrys who are law-abiding and follow the rules, but sadly, they are the minority in comparison. Some more serious ones make their way to the Exumas and further afield -- those are the ones who will typically contribute to the economy and play by the rules. Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them for us to consider them the majority! This time of year is mostly the powerboaters as opposed to the sailing yachts -- largely due to insurance regulations and hurricane season. But these boats do contribute to the local marinas, rentals, restaurants, groceries and liquor stores and are a welcome sight in the islands."
Thank you for the information.
Ya Dusty I have zero use for poachers. I’m told a lot of that has stopped since the BAhamas Defence Force has upgraded there boats. Hoping and praying I can make it down this Feb to help support the local economy. (Just ordered 4 new rods). One of the few places I can rent a boat
"Research on the coronavirus is far from being conclusive, and it will take a long time to completely understanding this contagion. The best/only strategy at this time is the lockdowns - which I agree with. Yet I do find the stigmata placed on US. residents disconcerting to say the least. Just remember history has shown that sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted!Gunderson Health has stated that 15%>40% people testing positive even have any ill affects. The other 60% plus are asymptomatic and never develop any signs or become I'll. That 25% swing shows me (IMHO) the statistic gathering still needs fine tuning.John's Hopkins shows the US #17 on a list of countries with a 6.45 daily positivity rate. Our good neighbors to the North - Canada at #19 4.17 daily positivity rate. So am I to understand that EU residents flying from the UK are allowed to vacation in the Bahamas? France has a 20.37 daily positivity rate. Scary huh?Be safe everyone.…jhu.edu/testing/international-comparisonEdited: 10:53 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"I just got a PM saying someone named 'Cloaca' said something mean about me, but I can't find find it.'Cloaca' can you post it again please."
The US has 2 million reported active cases.Canada has less than 5 thousand reported active cases.It's about the numbers.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
"CB, this is a travel forum so I won't get into another long health care debate with you.The Johns Hopkins site says that it gets its international testing data from Our World in Data. This is what Our World in Data shows for positivity rate by country:https:/…Canada 3.1%UK 3.7%Most of western Europe around 3%WHO guidance less than 5%USA 8.1%As you said, the Johns Hopkins data has the US at 6.45%, still above guidance. Also this data is all time averages of daily positivity, so it includes data from a month ago when the US was doing pretty well and headed in the right direction. I'm sure your current positivity data is much higher, I'm just too tired to look it up."
"Ok, I looked it up:https:/…testing-positivityJohns Hopkins data on positivity rates over the last 7 days shows 34 states over the 5% threshold. Florida, where most flights come from for Bahamas travel, has a positivity rate of 18.72% over the last 7 days.Now I can go to bed."
Sleep well WD
"It's all a spaghetti bowl of stats. The US has completed far more tests than any other country - no one comes close even. So if other countries ramp up there testing would their data not show a higher rate of infection? Most likely. Don't forget the majority of people infected are asymptomatic. So there is millions of people around the world walking around that have come in contact with the virus and have not been tested, and by the data the majority will be asymptomatic. If other countries were testing at a higher volume their infection rate percentage would climb as well.We are all in this together, and combating this together is the best course of action.Wishing the best for all of you!✌"
"No CB. As you increase your testing rate to include more asymptomatic people your positivity rate declines. If you are doing a lot of testing and your positivity rate is high it means you are in deep trouble.If you want to combat this together why did you leave the WHO?Edited: 1:12 am, July 21, 2020 "
Ha! Sleep tight WD.
"CB - time to turn off Fox News and come join us in the real world, quoting DT is a little embarrassing to be frank, the USA is out of control with in excess of 60,000 new cases daily it’s a total disgraceAs for the comment by a fellow poster regarding WHO, your country will come crawling back at some point, maybe when the new government takes control in Jan 21...."
The Bahamian government is taking the necessary measures to prevent the number of Covid-19 cases from increasing exponentially. They should be commended for their efforts. They do not want the country to become overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases - like the United States of America.
Who can blame them? The US has done an abysmal job wrt the virus. I'm in no hurry to go anywhere for a while anyway. Maybe next year we'll have a vaccine. I look forward to my next visit there.
Not sure about other airlines but jetblue has flown in empty planes during the previous lockdown /travel ban to take out passengers and have confirmed they will do so up until the July 27th. No confirmation yet on the flight schedule past that date.
"DaveC - if you think the WHO has handled this well then Pip Pip and Bully for you.Feb. 2The President said, ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" His executive order banning anyone who has been in China in the previous 14 days.Then the WHO statement 2 days later>Feb. 4During a WHO briefing, Tedros urged that there be no travel bans. ""We reiterate our call to all countries not to impose restrictions that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.""Then the WHO finally got off there duffs and sent a team to China to investigate the virus. IMHO probably late in doing so and completely behind the curve.So the US started travel banning before the WHO gave it a first thought.As for daily positivity rates> My supposition is if testing is available in a wider range of area in other countries people with mild effects may go get tested and show a positive for the virus. I am not saying more tests per day, I'm saying the same number of tests - this is only a supposition.As for Fox News - FYI I do not watch it."
"@CB ... lotsa people said lotsa stuff about Covid-19 in early February that proved to be unavailing, as we’ve learned a lot more about it over the past +5 months. A lotta people wish their quotes from Feb. 2 or so woulda kinda fade away. Lotsa people were “late” in their responses, in lotsa ways.Also, while the travel ban from China was necessary, the fact is that in the weeks after that “ban” was initiated, about 40,000 people arrived in the U.S. from China, some of them on direct flights from Wuhan. Upon arrival, they were jammed, unmasked and undistanced, into crowded arrival halls for hours on end, as the plans to handle their arrivals were chaotic and unorganized.Either way ... gene testing has shown that the strains most prevalent in the U.S. actually worked their way from China across Europe, and it appears that the worst U.S. infections were brought here, unsuspectingly, by travelers from then-hot-spots like Italy, Spain, the UK, etc. As it continues to unspool, this likely is the most complex challenge we’ve faced in our lifetimes. Compared to this, bro, wars seem kinda simple."
"@DaveA - Good information - thanks for posting.I just want to reiterate I am for the travel ban - especially from the US. I truly want the best for the good people of the Bahamas, and our friends on Eleuthera."
"We know where your heart is CB ... but we’re all bored and locked down and ripe for “discussions”. Be well, bro ..."
"CB, if you test asymptomatic people you will of course have some positive results. But the rate of positivity with asymptomatic testing is much, much lower than the rate of positivity with symptomatic testing. So, as you increase the amount of testing to more and more asymptomatic people your total positivity rate comes down.As you say the US is doing the most testing by far, and your positivity rate is 2-3 times higher than other western countries. You have a huge problem that is unique among developed countries, and this is why many countries are closing their borders to you.Yes the WHO made many mistakes. Are you saying that your leadership has not?"
"private charters are allowed entry, does that mean a silver charter flight ( or other company) from ft. Lauderdale can enter Eleuthera?"
"The primary reason that the US continues to skyrocket in covid cases is the lack of a coherent national policy. Each US State makes its own rules (or not) regarding business openings, public gatherings, indoor dining, masks, etc ... and, until very recently, there were no restrictions on interstate travel. Not shocking that places like Florida, Texas and the Carolinas are in the red, with amusement parks, bars and social events in full swing. Even now, in many cases the interstate travel restrictions are more like self-enforced ""suggestions"" or guidelines for self-quarantine when traveling from a hot spot to a state that is starting to get things under control. Other countries were able to bring it under control by instituting national policies of lockdowns, distancing, travel bans etc. The US, on the other hand, has no national plan in part because we have a president who is a narcissistic dim-wit that doesn't believe in science. But not to worry, the virus will disappear soon."
"Jersey Diver, I live in North Carolina and I can tell you we are not allowed more than 10 people for an inside gathering, outside 25. Bars are closed and gyms. No playgrounds are open No amusement parks. We are in phase 2 with mandatory mask in public. Schools will be all remote learning for the fall. You need to get your story straight before you post ."

"Sandal i'm always happy to admit if i mis-spoke, specifically regarding ""the Carolinas"" my apologies. Seems i lumped a few of the spiking sates together in one sentence with many of the attractions which are open, although not each category specifically to each state, very sharp of you to catch that. Regarding the comment - i have a brother in Orlando and last i checked Disney parks were open and happily packing 'em in... and have friends/family in Myrtle Beach who send daily reports/pics from the packed bars & restaurants etc. Thanx a bunch for helping me get my story straight."
"... meanwhile, two Cat Island residents who had not traveled anywhere have tested positive and are now being treated over in Nassau. This is why Eleuthera is nervous."
"jerseydiver your describution of your current president is spot on though ! Sad to read that Dave , if Covid made its way to Cat one of the less visited islands thats a big concern for Eleuthera and Exuma both far busier Islands , I have been travelling to Cat the last few years and this will be very bad indeed if more cases show up thereEdited: 5:09 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"Sorry lovinlife, no festivals in TX!I live in TX and I can guarantee you that we are not in full swing and our daily cases / hospitalizations / deaths are going down. When I do venture out a couple of times a week (once for groceries and once for take out to try and keep restaurants open), everyone is masked up and staying away from others. When I get take out, if I have to go inside to pick it up I might see one table occupied, even though according to the guidelines more would be permitted. People just aren't wanting to take any chances.Unfortunately, we have had 4106 deaths statewide, which is 4106 too many. That's 142 deaths per million population. NJ has lost over 12X that per million, and NY 27X that. They got through a much bigger problem than we are facing. We are not panicking, just trying to do the right thing to turn the daily increases in the other direction and it is working."
"Texas, I know. I was being facetious. Texas is locked down. The comment from Jersey boy made it seem as though you guys were having a grand time. Our area ICU beds are at 75% capacity. Gasp. Then you read the rest of the truth. They were between 70-80% capacity BEFORE COVID. .06% of positive cases end up in the ICU here."
"Dave , I'm sorry to hear about those residents in Cat. We love the people in both Cat and Eleuthera.i hope they recover and that it won't spread."
"#70 - Dave, absolutely! That these two had no travel history is most concerning. That Cat Island is nowhere as busy as other islands -- Eleuthera, Exuma -- is even more alarming. I wonder if people also realise that these two residents needed to pay for a charter from Cat to Nassau to receive medical treament? To the tune of around $2000. And that they had to be taken into specialised medical isolation travel pods at more expense. Such as things are in the islands. I will be watching today's update with some trepidation, as you can well imagine. 21 new cases yesterday is almost double from the previous high one day total -- the day before at 15. Single digits for the previous 3 1/2 months and now this. Stay safe, folks -- wherever you are!"
"This is very worrying , Dusty can repost that to the Exuma forum they seem oblivious on that forum about what is unfolding , very frustrating and concerning that folks are still trying to get there come hell or high water !"
"DonK, I've given up on that forum -- there are several ""vocal"" non-residents who have rental homes who would prefer the truth not be told. Sadly, ""oblivious"" is a nice word -- I prefer willful selfishness for some of the ""noisy"" ones."
"”In these uncertain times,” it appears fashionable for folks of modest math ability to cherry-pick stats — especially numbers that look conveniently small — to imply that the pandemic is a raft of hype and media lies: The low case counts in their rural state, the bed space in their small-town hospital’s ICU, where the nurses are sitting round playing canasta on empty gurneys, etc. (These folks tend to be *terrible* poker players, but that’s another story ...)For those stats-whizzes, I offer this one: On the morning of 9-11-2001, the mathematical probability that any individual American would die in a terrorist attack mounted by Osama bin Laden was infinitesimal. It remained infinitesimal after 3,000 Americans died in the terrorist attacks that morning. It was about 1-to-.00000909 (3K fatalities of 330M population).So ... no big deal, right? Just more lies and media hype, right? Pretty small numbers, eh?Flash forward: In about 6 months, Covid-19 has killed about 140,000 Americans — the equivalent of a 9-11 event every couple of days, with no end in sight.That 9-11 attack changed our lives forever: It spawned 2 wars — one of which we’re still fighting — and forever changed how we board aircraft and enter public buildings, to the point of allowing government agents to scan or strip-search you en route to Eleuthera. (Tell ‘em they’re violating your rights — I dare ya.)Yet an event 45 times more deadly, and growing, has ruff-tuff-creampuffs whimpering about wearing a little paper mask, and how “boring” it all is, and demanding their right to party down or go wherever they want on vacation — even to an island they claim to love, where *one* incoming case could prove catastrophic. SMH."
"Well said Dave. As fun as this thread has been, it was bound to melt a few snowflakes. I kinda regret mentioning politics but too late. Simple facts, covid in the US is out of control largely due to a lack of any coherent national plan; with each state doing its own thing. Contrast that with other countries who have largely brought it under control. The Bahamas had done a very good job of keeping it out and (as discussed on a different thread) the current traveller testing scheme is flawed. We cancelled our regular trip to Da Rock this summer as a matter of conscience and respect, but sadly as pointed out so many “couped up” people who need to get away will no doubt bring the gift of covid to Eleuthera. It’s only a matter of when. Prayers for the good people there. We are well-traveled, and Eleuthera happens to be one of , if not our favorite destination and we will miss it for now. Sad to say in our recent travels we have noticed increasing anti-American sentiments in many countries (not the Bahamas- yet) because so many portray that sense of entitlement. Here’s hoping that, when this is all behind us, that the good people of the Bahamas realize that not all Americans fit that mold."
