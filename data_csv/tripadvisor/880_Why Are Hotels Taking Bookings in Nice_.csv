"Dear All,Why are large hotel chains like Accor taking bookings right now for tonight and offering refundable rates? Mayor Estrosi has banned the tourist activity during the Easter holidays? However smaller hotels like Hotel Florence in Nice are not taking bookings until after the 11th May. Hotel Eden in Juan Les Pins are doing the same as Hotel Florence. See below text in French from Nice Matin regarding Mayor Estrosi directive.Le maire de Nice prend donc immédiatement un arrêté municipal interdisant toutes activités de locations de type AirBnB (sauf les logements déjà occupés dans le cadre du confinement) et les hébergements hôteliers sur Nice à des fins de villégiature, pendant la période des vacances de Pâques."
The text from the mayor says that accommodation cannot be rented if for holiday purposes. Maybe some business people still have essential travel and the room letting is allowed in these circumstances. In Avignon I know an hotel where an association has paid for a homeless man to be accommodated during confinement.
"Tradeform, this is not the case. I can go on and book a room in Nice right now and pay a non-refundable price without any part of the site asking me the purpose of my travel.There isn't even a note about Covid-19 on the site - at least AirBnB have a note but still let you book which is ridiculous. It is tantamount to fraud, taking money for a service that you cannot provide."
Maybe you should alert the Mairie de Nice about the situation. But since Mr Estrosi's friend Mr Sarkozy is on the board of Accor perhaps nothing will happen.
"Not tantamount to fraud at all. They can certainly provide the service, and it is a service which could be of considerable value to those lawfully allowed to use it. It is your own personal responsibility to know whether you yourself can lawfully use that service, and you would have to have been living in a cave for the last months not to realise that there might well be problems with that.This is a similar situation to people buying air tickets to countries for which they need a visa or otherwise cannot enter, when it is the individual's responsibility to check their entitlement to enter, not the airline's.You can buy air tickets from other countries to France for dates this week (e.g. London to Paris) without any warning that you cannot use them for tourism. And I can buy a train ticket without any questions whatsoever to hop across the border, even though for tourism it's unlawful for me to travel either side of the border. Is all that tantamount to fraud too? Are we now living in a world where individuals shouldn't have to take responsibility for anything? Surely not.Edited: 7:26 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Why do other responsible hotels have notices on Covid-19. and others don't? They SHOULD ask you for the reason of your travel before they take your money in an non-refunfdable payment. As we have seen in every country people don't obey laws, that is why lockdowns are enforced. Here someone can book a hotel without stating the nature of their business and the hotel will take the money without asking questions - it is immoral and unethical. There is a responsibility on EVERYONE including hotels to ensure that correct procedures are being followed. If they are taking bookings they should check that clients have attestations stating the nature of their visit."
"Since when have Mr Sarkozy and his friends been moral and ethical? Do you remember that time when Mr Estrosi spent several thousand Euros of taxpayers' money to fly back from the USA in time for a cocktail? https://www.20minutes.fr/france/211278-20080…Edited: 8:58 am, April 15, 2020 "
"So British Airways and Trenitalia (to reference my travel examples), not to mention all Irish buses, trains and hotels, should also demand 'attestations'? We'll have to agree to disagree. But personally I think this is ridiculous, and that to say it's immoral and unethical is absurd. If anyone at the moment is living in such a self-centred bubble that they don't realise there are travel restrictions, they deserve everything they get if booking a hotel they can't lawfully use for tourism, and that they can't even lawfully travel to for that purpose. But then I'm obviously now far too old to believe there is anything wrong with treating grown-ups like responsible adults rather than like children."
"Don't be ridiculous bringing Irish trains into this it has nothing to do with it. There is a collective responsibility here...that includes hotels. For this reason supermarkets restrict numbers of certain items to people who live in your so called self-centred bubble...by your logic let them buy as much as they want and to hell with everybody else. While you are at it let anyone buy PPE and don't prioritise it for frontline medical staff. Do you believe police stopping groups of adults congregating during a lockdown is treating them like children? What's absurd is your blindness to greed and lack of ethics.Edited: 10:35 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Hotel managers do not have police privileges. If some hotels are legally open (for instance to provide shelter for some essential workers that cannot go home) it is not up to them to do police control on their customers. If you are visiting now a hotel in Nice and do not have the proper reason to travel, the hotel is not doing something illegal. You are."
"It is facilitating something illegal, which is also illegal. By that logic buying a stolen bike on the promenade is not illegal, you didn't do anything illegal, the thief who sold it to you did. I doubt that essential workers are going to websites and deciding whether they should opt for the refundable or no-refundable rate....do you? I have no problem with hotels open for essential staff...if that is the case they don't need to be touting for business online now....they can simply have a phone number that essential staff can ring. Now do we have any more apologists for this despicable behaviour?Edited: 12:27 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Re my post 6 - I've just realised the fight was not from, but to the USA. He wasted his ticket on a regular AF flight and spent €138,000 on a private jet just to have a cocktail with Sarkozy and his cronies."
Nice Pebbles are still touting for business online. You can book any of their apartments right now. Not one mention of Covid-19 on their website.
"@12 yep happy to take money which will become non refundable...these places need to be called out...crisis or no crisis...it is just not ethical. I think anyone right now laying out full prepayments or even deposits runs a serious risk of never seeing their money again. It seems logical ,but I think some posting here think there will be a rush to book in fall etc. and they can get their spot now. I don't think that will be the case at all.Edited: 2:44 pm, May 02, 2020 "
"Offaly,Although in many ways Nice is my favourite place in the entire world there is a good deal of chicanery that is regarded as normal but be considered anything but in Northern Europe.Very sorry indeed that the ever helpful Ed has disappeared. I fear I have a good idea why. Robert"
