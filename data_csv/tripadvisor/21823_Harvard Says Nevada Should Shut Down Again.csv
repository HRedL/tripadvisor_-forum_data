"@ JoeYou are very much mistaken, PnSfromLA has provided uncountable LV tips (for visitors), which have been on-point, tasteful, and economical for those of us who who desire a richer vacation experience. His vacation opinions/suggestions regarding Las Vegas are inspirational to those who can see it; and his political views are quite challenging which should make the best of us open-minded and properly handle controversy as powerful mature adults. It isn’t an easy task but we should probably clean each of our own mirrors often so we can accurately Reflect upon its Reflection....Ohmmmm....But, like you, I could be wrong.@ PnSfromLA, BTW did I mention that after following your advice of a once-in-a-lifetime deal that I was upgraded from Skylofts to The Mansion?

Thanks again!""Funny the 1% of the 1% defending each other. for the most part PnS throws out there all the time what magnificent suites he stays in and constantly recommends them even when people are asking about basic rooms. Laughable."
"@AndrewThank you for the kind words. Yes, you told me you were getting upgraded to The Mansion. Were you able to work out getting upgraded to the 3 Bedroom with pool? Regardless, I'm very happy for you. It is an experience I hope to enjoy one day. If you've noticed, I've never asked your political beliefs. Not that you shouldn't feel free to share them if you wish. In the end, however, they are irrelevant to me. They don't change my opinion of you nor my enjoyment of you and your wonderful wife's company. Thanks to the internet/social media where you can find people who think exactly like you, too many of us have come to expect only that. I actually prefer having friends with diverse perspectives and who have led different lives. How are we ever going to grow if we only hang around with people ""like us""? How are we ever being truly tolerant when tolerance is only extended to those we already find socially acceptable? Sad world we live in right now on so many levels, which is a shame because there are so many things in this world to be grateful for.Edited: 11:14 am, August 10, 2020 "
I guess Big Daddy wasn't happy with his room or the service during his stay at the Mansion?
"@BigI'm not the 1% of the 1%. I'm not even the 1%. I'm comfortable. Andrew can speak for his families situation, that is his business. Regardless of what I do or do not have, you berate me for my lifestyle yet I am the one sticking up for the people that you and many others, including politicians on both sides of the aisle ignore. I do this because I was one of these people. I am far far from a socialist, but I believe in decency and equality for all. Equal opportunities not equal outcomes. The people who aren't suffering and won't ever be suffering economically from COVID-19 dictating the circumstances by which others who are less fortunate must live their lives is extremely distasteful to me. Wealthy people who support stay at home orders, mask mandates, etc. Yet fly off to their private ranch/island/estate or freedom loving state/area where they have the freedom to do whatever they want, yet look down their noses at the people who merely want to go to work or shop at a market without having to wear a mask. For the record, I tailor my advice to the circumstances. The only time I'll ever discuss say The Mansion is if someone asks about what are the best rooms at MGM or something similar. It isn't my place to know their economic level and if anything being in sales for a very long time, I know to not discriminate against people. ""Room"" can mean ""suite"" or ""villa"" to some. Or maybe the person is like me and just likes to have as much information as possible. I always appreciate knowing all of the options out there so I can make an informed decision. Simply saying ""stay in the Grand King"" isn't doing it."

"@andrew I agree with you. While politically I’m completely opposite of pns and many of his views infuriate me, it challenges me to see hisnPOV Although I mostly fail to do so , I’m grateful for the exercise. And yes he has in the past given some great accounts and advice for a more luxurious vegas experience he’s not that dissimilar to the rich in Harvard after all :)"

"No university that's opinion is bought by donors should be taken seriously. After reading the comments in this thread I have a what I think is a simple question. How does one allow someone else's views to infuriate them? If you have conviction in your own views, your own ideology, and your own values, why would someone else's point of view matter to you? I try to learn from others, once I determine I can that they have conviction and aren't just repeating things they hear on CNN.Edited: 10:35 pm, August 10, 2020 "
