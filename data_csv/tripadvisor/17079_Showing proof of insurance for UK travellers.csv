Has anyone from the UK ever been asked to show proof of medical insurance on arrival? If so what exactly did you show?Not looking for a rant about not having insurance-I have it I'm just concerned about what they class as proof.I'm booked with trail finders and have their insurance. On my printed booking confirmation there is a line that shows I have paid for and booked their insurance then in a totally separate booklet it actually outlines the details. The girl in trail finders had never heard of anyone being asked for proof of insurance on arrival and they are pretty experienced. If they don't accept this as proof what will happen?Thanks
Nothing will happen.You have proof you have some cover so it will be enough.
"70peter:They probably will not ask for proof. That law was brought in to stop American Cubans travelling to Cuba and having free hospital treatment. It was never meant for tourists such as we are, however in the early days the odd person was asked for proof. What you have will be fine, but make sure you carry it in your hand luggage just in case you are asked."
"I can only say that we were in Cuba in November. The only question I was asked was had I been in Africa in the last three weeks. No mention of either health insurance or return air ticket, be aware that the immigration process can be quite slow, certainly set Havana airport."
That question about whether you have been in Africa is quite frequently asked nowadays due to the Ebola epidemic.
