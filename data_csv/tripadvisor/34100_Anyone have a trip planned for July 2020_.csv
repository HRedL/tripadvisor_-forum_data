I have a trip planned to Sao Miguel and Pico in July. I know none of us have a crystal ball but is anyone else in the same boat? I don’t want to cancel but I also don’t want to be a fool. Cancel or Wait it out?
We are booked end of June and have the same concerns. See post link below for helpful info on gradual reopening.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g189123…
Thank you. I saw this. If there’s a 14 day quarantine there’s no point in me going since I have a 7 day trip. Just curious if others are keeping their reservations. Azores Airlines says we have until May 31 to reschedule at no cost but I feel like there’s not enough information for me to make a decision.
When I read that I assumed refund would only be for trips up until the June 6th flight suspension? Or does this include trips after? I booked through expedia but upon reading it looks like they follow suit with the airline.
"Cancel or Wait it out? If you cancel will you get refunds? Because airlines (in general) are not doing refunds, offering vouchers or reschedule have been the options.A lot can change till the end of May... the opening has just started and we have to wait until mid May to have an idea of the consequences, and the goal is still the same, not to overload the health system which was totally achieved with the lockdown. Now Brussels is proposing to extend EU entry ban to 15 June, it has to be approved/accepted by the countries."
"Hmmm. Maybe I read it wrong. We have AA for inter island flights. We are flying TAP from Boston to Sao Miguel. On May 6, they released for the Azores “ As determined by the Regional Health Authorities, all passengers arriving to Azores are obligated to comply with the mandatory quarantine period of 14 days, at a predefined location.” No point in going for a week if I’m in quarantine."
"I have a trip Booked on TAP Boston to PDL and a house rented for July 21 to July 30, I can't cancel the flight with TAP at this Point because they are only giving vouchers on flights that start before June 30th, the house has free cancellation up until May 22nd, so what I think I'm going to do is Cancel the house and book another one that has a 100% cancelation date of July 6th, which gives me more time to make the fission without losing any money in the meantime if I do have to cancel the whole trip which I'm hoping I will not have to. Portugal needs my tourist dollars, it can be done, so let's make it happen."
All good ideas. Thank you so much for sharing. Is your rental through AirBnb? We have three different rentals and all through AirBnb but would lose money on canceling those too. My airline is TAP to Sao Miguel but AA to Pico and back. This is so stressful! I want to go but also don't want to lose large amounts of money. We are a group of 4.
"We have three different rentals and all through AirBnb but would lose money on canceling those too - the new law in Portugal for situations canceled because of Covid19 (except flights) is all about vouchers, rescheduling (refunding only after December 2021), here's the decree-law if you have to ask that to any of your rentals https:/…maximized"
"correct me if I'm wrong but according to summary of this regulation in English, it seems that it does not apply to reservations made not directly but through agency (for example at Airbnb). Am I right?I have three bookings (Pico, Corvo and Flores) for July and two of these bookings are made at Airbnb. These two bookings are flexible and if I cancel them before end of June, my initial payments should be refunded (minus Airbnb's administration fee). I hope that this new law in Portugal does not apply to these two bookings, as it would mean that instead of refunds (if I need to cancel these bookings), Airbnb will be trying to force me to accept voucher or to reschedule my stays. What do you think about it?"
If I have to cancel - which is definitely likely- I’d hope Id get refunds. I am traveling with three friends so who knows if this will be possible next summer.
"it seems that it does not apply to reservations made not directly but through agency (for example at Airbnb). Am I right? I don't think so, on the full portuguese version you can ""see"" that article 4 and paragraphs is all about booking directly or using a digital platform..."
"I’d hope Id get refunds - if it's accommodation then for a refund they can delay it till January 2022 by giving you a voucher that can be used by yourself or another person (article 3, paragraph 2a) )"
I plan for September Trip to Azores iam going to be quarentene
I have a trip for September from Boston to Azores do I have to be quarentene when I get there
"I plan for September Trip to Azores iam going to be quarentene- good only knows... The rules now (May 2020) the Azores have 4 different ""approaches"" to those arriving to the region:The first is to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 virus test within 72 hours before the flight departed for the Azores and the result was negative.Second option: consists of performing the screening test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the moment it disembarks. Then you will be taken to a hotel determined by the Regional Government of the Azores, where you have the obligation to remain in prophylactic isolation, until the result of the test. The maximum time limit for transmitting your test result is 48 hours.third option: voluntary quarantine for a consecutive period of fourteen days in a hotel indicated for this purposefourth option, which is to return to the place of origin of your flight or to travel to any airport outside the Autonomous Region of the Azores."
This is really helpful! Where did you get this information? I'd love to share it with my group and learn more!
"so presently, to be clear, arrive with a negative test conducted within 72 hours and you have a green light to enter and travel freely?"
"Where did you get this information? You have it, the official info in portuguese only https:/…A7ores.pdf"
"arrive with a negative test conducted within 72 hours and you have a green light to enter and travel freely? To enter yes. At the official pdf they refer a self-quarantine (to be honest, I find this a non-sense... and there's no way that they can check/enforce this). Anyway really important is that it's also referred that if you are still remaining in the island 5 days after the date of your negative test you have to do a new one there and get a negative result again... all this is obviously not friendly..."
We have a trip July 2 - 9th and are waiting it out until AirBNB and the airline allow refunds/cancellations. Right now it's only through June 30th but I can't imagine that won't be extended. We have trip insurance on the flights but AirBNB rental was only 50% refund (lesson learned) and really don't want to be out that money.
"AirBNB rental was only 50% refund (lesson learned) and really don't want to be out that money - If your flights are cancelled then you are entitled to a voucher of that value and if you don't use it till December 31st 2021, a refund in a period of 14 days. Check post #8. The link for the decree-law is there and there's a summary in english."
Yes. Same issue with our Air Bnb. Are your flying TAP?
"We are booked for end of July. Have a good cancellation with our Air B&B of only 5 days before. Flying with TAP via Lisbon. Their website says from 1st July they will be doing daily flights but not sure whether it will be my flight or not. If flight is not cancelled then flights are my biggest exposure to the tune of £1,000. Reschedule has to be before Feb 2021 and I don't really fancy going in the Winter. If I can get assurance that a) the Azoreans will actually want tourists and b) there will be enough restaurants and activities open then I will go for it, even if that means wearing facemasks on the flights for a couple of hours and having to go for a test a few days into the holiday."
I’m in a similar boat although my air Bnb will only refund half. I’m also going about it a similar way. The stress of “not knowing” is driving me nuts.
"I've done some further digging today on the flights. If I try and book flghts with TAP for my dates they seem to be only doing the late evening flight from Lisbon to the Azores which I deliberately avoided and opted for the early evening flight. But my 11am Heathrow flight still seems to be available, so does this technically count as a rescheduling to which I would be entitled a voucher? As it stands if they said my flight was still technically running it would mean an 8 hour layover in Lisbon. Not what we would want to be doing with face masks mandatory! Alternatively there is an evening Heathrow flight but that only allows 1 hour transfer between flights at Lisbon and one would assume things are only going to be slower at transfer rather than slower. 1 hour seems very tight but they were prepared to sell it to me!"
I think you still have to quarentine with negative results I have trip for last week in July so if they dont change regulations maybe not worth the effort.
Yikes. Tough decision. I wish they would just refund! Mine is a direct flight from Boston.
"They have changed all you need is a negative test within 72 hours of arriving, and no quarantine, also maybe even future less restrictive by July. https:/…alerts-and-informations"
"""In the cases referred to in paragraphs a) and b) passengers must comply with prophylactic isolation at their home, or at the hotel where they are staying, until the result of the test carried out on the 14th day is known.""I think this means even though you have a negative test you still have to isolate untill 14th day!"
"My interpretation is that if you arrive with a negative test result you are fine until day 5 when you have to be retested and then isolate for the next 24-48 hours while those results come back and then if you are still visiting, get tested again on day 14, presumably because there will be a concern that hotels will act as points of transmission. Mind you what I still can’t get my head round is whether I can legitimately travel to Heathrow in the first place!"
"My interpretation is that if you arrive with a negative test result you are fine until day 5 when you have to be retested and then isolate for the next 24-48 hours while those results come back and then if you are still visiting, get tested again on day 14 - correct, because the so called ""self-quarantine"" for those with a negative test is not only a non-sense as impossible to enforce. It's against the portuguese constitution to enforce it (meaning that the police/authorities can not check if you are doing or not), that was possible only when we were in State of emergency."
"Change as of 28/05: “The main change has to do with the 14-day prophylactic isolation. With the greatest awareness that we believe there is, from the point of view of the care that each one should have, this is no longer a requirement ”, said the President of the Government."" https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/?p=5559 --> This is a big step in the direction of making it possible to visit again."
"I will start some ""soft planning"" for July 17 and definitely get tested, 24 before I travel to insure the safety of those around me. Masks when inside and socially distance. This is logical and correct. I will wait until mid June to book all. Thanks for sharing, Geert."
"Well, the difference is that the mentioning of a ""self-quarantine"" for those arriving with a negative test at arrival has disappeared... it was an impossible measure to implement/enforce. The rest remains equal. The good news is that the inter-island flights are going to restart and also the ferry connections between Terceira, Graciosa, São Jorge, Pico and Faial are going to restart. The ports are open to yacht and the sailors has to be submitted to the same rules/tests as those arriving by air. https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/?p=5608"
I am from São Miguel. No testing or quarentine needed at the moment.
"AndreNPA - No testing or quarentine needed at the moment - quarantine yes, if you are in azores read the official publications of the regional government and you'll see that testing is mandatory... you have the link on post#34 and if you want a message from the regional secretary of tourism it's here https://www.publituris.pt/2020/05/29/nenhum-turista-ou-residente-tera-qualquer-custo-com-um-teste-realizado-dentro-da-regiao/?utm_term=Como+os+Acores+preparam+o+Ovirar+de+paginaO&utm_campaign=Publituris&utm_source=e-goi&utm_medium=email"
Can anyone advise on whether taxis will be running? I fear my evening arrival is going to bumped to the Lisbon TAP flight that comes in at 23.30. I can't imagine I''l be able to pick up a car rental at that point (the WayZores desk says it closes at midnight and I doubt I'll get to it in time with all the added COVID checks etc.) so in the event that I can arrive at the airport with a negative test result will I be left stranded at Midnight? I'm heading to an Air B&B
"Can anyone advise on whether taxis will be running? Yes, any plane arrival is a business opportunity... and there are not that many nowadays."
"We have booked for 31st of july, and we don't have our flights yet, but wondering if it makes sense to rik it or not..."
"I have July 19 flights booked, and will most likely be cancelling. Its a very bad sign that Portugal was left out of the UK air bridge today. I don't have faith that they will allow US tourists by then. Apparently, July 1 is a big day for international travel decisions. I will wait until then, and then decide what to do."
I have tickets for July 6. I’m waiting to cancel because my understanding is if the airline cancels the flight then they have to issue a refund.
