Where can I find websites or links for information related to visiting Australia during this period of covid-19 ?
If you are talking about visiting as a tourist then no you can't ... this is the website you need ... https:/…2
"Thank you Under the (ALL OTHERS) section, it says all arriving travelers must be quarantined for 14 days but an exemption can be applied. I wonder what's the conditions for exemption and if anyone has successfully applied for it ?The website doesn't say for how long will these conditions but Air Asia, which I am holding tickets only allow travel until end of October."
"No one here can help you ... you need to use the government site ... the only exemption I am aware of is for Kerry Stokes and his wife, a billionaire media mogul ... are you a billionaire and friends with our prime minister?"
"Having a flight ticket or voucher that expires is not grounds for a quarantine exemption. Exemptions are only approved for very specific circumstances which are explained at the link above.Edited: 5:21 am, May 08, 2020 "
"""Under the (ALL OTHERS) section, it says all arriving travelers must be quarantined for 14 days but an exemption can be applied. I wonder what's the conditions for exemption and if anyone has successfully applied for it ?""First of all you are missing the vital point that you are not allowed to enter Australia unless you have a compelling or compassionate reason to be allowed entry. The impending expiring of your ticket won't suffice. Without obtaining, in advance, permission to enter the country, which is done on a discretionary basis, it is a pointless exercise to see if you can be exempt from the mandatory quarantine.------------------------""The website doesn't say for how long will these conditions but Air Asia, which I am holding tickets only allow travel until end of October.""There is a simple reason for that. The Government imposed the restrictions ""until further notice"". Period. This means nobody can give you the information you are looking for because it does not exist. What the website does say is to check back often for updates. Bookmark this home page for that purpose. It has a 'Latest Updates' section: https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/"
"Exemptions will only be applied for scientists, medical professionals, diplomats and other VIPs. Not for travellers who want to dodge the rules."
"Thank you. No, I am not from Indonesia."
Hopefully Air Asia will extend the life of your ticket when it crystallises that the travel ban to Australia will extend beyond October and travel is simply not possible. The banning of non Australian citizens/PR arrivals and mandatory quarantining has saved us. The Oz govt won’t be changing these arrangements until the whole thing is resolved globally.
"""Perfectly""Perth ... << So Able you seem to only be aware of the one newsworthy name (which was a legitimate medical exemption). I guess it's far too boring to make yourself aware of the thousand other exemptions that were granted on medical and other grounds - simply because their names are not famous.>> Thanks for the snarky commentary but I have zero desire to research who can and can't come in under exemptions ... I certainly am not bored enough to go through that ... maybe if I was extremely self rightous and need to feel superior I would go to the trouble ... but I'm not."
Are the reasons for exemptions which have been granted actually publicly available anywhere? I have personal reasons for wanting to see what might qualify.
"Yes, thx Mia, I’ve looked at the link but am looking for some real world experience as to what constitutes ‘humanitarian and compassionate’. For eg if a team of rugby league players can enter ( still can’t work out under which category they would fall), could a grandmother apply to be here for the birth of a first grandchild. One seems much more compassionate than the other to me, but I suspect would not even be considered. And I also note that Home Affairs simply don’t get back to you at all if they don’t intend to grant the exemption so how long do you wait to know?Just wondering if anyone has any practical experience?"
"Perfectly ... Pet, I didn't harp on about it ... it was you that bought it up , anyway I let it go at that, I'm not one to comment on your inane posts, so I won't. Seriously ... have you nothing better to do than go around being the forum police?"
"When they close all the theatres and all the bars, one has to make one's own entertainment."
@18 Looks like the real forum police have struck again

"Everyones a tad techy I guess, strange times ... personally I think posts should stay up so we can all see how people really think and behave."
Well someone from a distant part of the country was extremely rude to me and I replied in kind ... and someone didn't like my replies ... that's about it.
"Wasn't worth reading, GurusW."
"Gurus, the 'extremely rude' they are referring to is post 10, I think. I didn't think it was extremely rude. It is still there. Missed the deleted posts."
"***TA: Time to ""Drain the swamp !"" Unfortunately #24 has not headed their own advise on many forums."
"44 posts and not one piece of positive travel information.It is a real shame, forums and questions are asked to assist postersso most definately **Time to ""Drain the swamp**Let's get back to assisting posters with their travel enquires from real people who want to help others."
Looks like the heat is pretty bad in WA and people have been in lockdown too long with too much time on their hand since the 15th AprilNo reviews and no helpful travel advice.I do hope the OP has the information they needed as there is not a lot available now https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/city-…Looks like foreigners will need to wait.
"No mention of a newly joined contributor anywhere!FWIW, my son is a police officer in WA and has been at the 'frontline' dealing with interstate and international travellers at times during the last few weeks. If a resident is returning, they can quarantine at home, but they will be checked on by police. He thinks that although I'm a citizen, I'm not a resident so probably would be allowed in but would have to pay for quarantine in a hotel but my OH if he travelled with me, probably wouldn't be allowed in as he's only my children's step father. not biological."
"***I am sure some contributors would recognise my writing style^^I think post #35 just does not get it.This and other Forums are suppose to be family friendly and travel related forums to assist posters to make their travels enjoyable as per Trip Advisor guidelines.There is no place for political and abrasive non travel related statements.It does look like the swamp needs to be cleaned out and maybe in the doing so we may lose some posters along the way. which will not be a bad thing as they tend to infiltrate into other forums tooHopefully the real posters will family friendly and helpful posts will come back to help posters with their future travel plans.PS BellaHampshire I would do a little more research on that situation.Edited: 5:36 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"Bella ... your husband, as the spouse of a citizen is able to enter the country ... all explained here ... https:/…2Now as to the quarantine I am not sure ... I ""believe"" you can do it at home if you arrive directly into your home city ... otherwise it's an hotel. I am led to believe this is paid for by the government, you should check that though."
"""I ""believe"" you can do it at home if you arrive directly into your home city ... otherwise it's an hotel.""My understanding is that you have to be quarantined at a hotel of governments choosing and not at home, unless you get an exemption."
I think you are right Cromansydney2.I was led to believe that no matter what state you are in all repatriated flights from a foreigh country need to be put in isolation for 14 days at a government nominated hotel.
"Sorry Bella, that's old news. Now all arrivals to WA have to quarantine in a hotel and not go home for 14 days. From the official website:""Returning to WA from international travel If you are an Australian citizen or permanent resident arriving back in Australia, you’ll be subject to the Australian Government’s mandatory quarantine period of 14 days at your first Australian destination. You will be provided with suitable accommodation to stay in during this period. However, you will not be permitted to travel domestically (including to your home) or continue on any domestic connections, until the 14 day mandatory quarantine period has been completed. """
"Thanks YorkFoodie!We have flights booked for February for a 6 week visit so fingers crossed the quarantine is not deemed necessary by then!My son is on different duties now, when he told me that, it was a few weeks ago."

One situation that has been granted is an exemption due to a child being in hospital near death.
If you are needed to assist your daughter due to her having no partner (or one with the ADF and deployed) then you could try and make a case. The other concern is that there are no flights coming into the country.
"""One situation that has been granted is an exemption due to a child being in hospital near death.""A parent can enter Australia under the current restrictions, so I assume you are referring to obtaining an exemption from quarantine. These are allowed under medical or compassionate grounds, but the thing to note those decisions are made by the State or Territory of arrival, whereas entry exemptions are dealt with by the Federal Border Force.--------------------------------------""The other concern is that there are no flights coming into the country.""I am sorry but that is plain wrong. Just this morning there were flights arriving in Sydney , for example, from Vancouver, Tokyo, Hong Kong (4 flights), San Francisco, Shanghai, Xiamen (2 flights), Singapore and Auckland."
Do you have to pay for the quarantine period in the hotel run by the government?
"""Do you have to pay for the quarantine period in the hotel run by the government?""When the quarantine measure was announced by the Prime Minister on 27 March he said this:""The Commonwealth will provide support through the ABF and ADF for these arrangements across Australia, and that states and territories would meet the costs and determine any contributions required for travellers arriving within their jurisdictions.""I took that to mean that inbound travellers would not have to pay for their 14 days hotel quarantine. States such as NSW and Victoria confirmed that the mandatory stays would be 'free of charge'.But, it turns out that the Northern Territory decided to hit inbound travellers arriving in Darwin with a $2500 fee for quarantine. This, I believe, is against the spirit of the Prime Minister's announcement but it was clearly provided for in the meeting that precipitated the quarantine decision.As far as I know, and I stand to be corrected, NT is the only state/territory imposing a fee. If, for example, your arrival point is Sydney, you don't have to pay for the hotel stay.Edited: 5:24 pm, May 20, 2020 "
Radio news on my way to work this morning was saying universities are looking to open up to international students soon. Plans would seem to include the mandatory 14day quarantine but this time round the bill wont be picked up by the government.
