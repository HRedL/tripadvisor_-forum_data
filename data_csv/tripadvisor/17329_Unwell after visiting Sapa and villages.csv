"Hi,I returned home to Australia after visiting Hanoi, Sapa, Hue and Hanoi. 3 days after I got home I developed a high temperature and feeling generally unwell. 2 more days later I started to break out in a rash with the first spot starting in the middle of my chest. The first spot was different to the remaining spots.I've seen two doctors so far and they cannot identify what I might have caught. I've had bloods which have not identified the illness and they are currently growing cultures. The rest of the family are not unwell, its only me. The only 2 things that happened during the trip that are different to my hubby and daughter (we shared every meal etc) is that a Black H'Mong lady tried to take my bracelet off my arm during a walk through a village and when I would not give it to her she mauled me and then spat in my face three times. I had not been wearing it but had accidentally put it on that morning out of habit so I do blame myself for this and don't hold a grudge. I only mention it as maybe this lady had some sort of illness that she may have passed onto me. The other different thing is that I went to a fishing village near Hoian to take photos without the family and did accept a cup of tea from the tour guide who assured me was safe to drink.Has anyone else had a similar experience or have you heard of any outbreaks in Sapa? I will be posting this in each of the forums in case its helpful. I absolutely loved my holiday and wouldn't trade it so this in no way is to put Vietnam down in any way, just trying to figure out what I may have.Cheers"
Hi - glad you enjoyed your holiday. Is it possible a mosquito has bitten you? I was bitten by one in India last November and contracted Chikungunya. A recurring virus that has me laid low periodically with stiff joints and muscles - very painful!! It takes a while to grow cultures - you may also have Dengue Fever or Malaria. Both mosquito borne virus. Look them up on the internet - Chikungunya matches your symptoms but not if you do not have the stiff joints.We are going to all the places you have just been in September - will be taking a LOT of insect repellant!! Hope you feel better soonCheers
"Hi missdoo01,I'm very sorry to hear about your illness. I hope the blood cultures identify the condition and that you feel better soon. Other than the incident I hope you enjoyed Sapa. Thank you for your post and please let us how how you're doing.Cheers!"
"Hi Shalleen C,The Malaria test has come back negative but I don't know which diseases the Dr tested for as he didn't hand me the pathology slip as he gave it to the place for me. I was only bitten by one mosquito that I know of so I don't think I would have Dengue as I thought you had to have multiple bites? I didn't see any mozzies any where to be honest which really surprised me after visiting Cambodia years ago and sometimes having them as a blanket in the sky.I absolutely loved the places we visited and have no regrets, you will have a great time."
Hi 'missdoo01'Unfortunately just one lone mossie can cause a life of misery for months to come!! Let us know the outcome of the cultures. I will keep my fingers crossed for you.BlessingsEdited: 3 years ago 
So far I went to Sapa two nights with trekking on 2013 but It didn't happen to me.Hope you are ok now.
"Dear Robina,The symptoms you describe seem quite similar to those related to dengue fever which, this year, appears to have become epidemic in Vietnam. I hope you will soon feel better."
Update - FYI.I have a severe case of Chicken Pox. I have been vaccinated in 2013 but apparently it didn't work as I had no antibodies to Chicken Pox.Incubation period puts me in Sapa at the time I became infectious. I have been horribly sick but nothing I can do about it.Thanks everyone for your advice.
"I am so sorry to hear that you have been so sick - surprising since you had the vaccination. Scary!!No, nothing any one of us with Chikungunya, Malaria and Dengue fever can do about it either.I guess you are lucky that once the chicken pox is gone, in a relatively short time, that will be the end of the pain.All the best - and blessings"
