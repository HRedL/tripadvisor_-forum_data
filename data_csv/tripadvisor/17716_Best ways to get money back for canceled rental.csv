"Need to cancel condo rental due to fact we are over 70 and advised not to travel due to pandemic. We have paid 5 weeks rent and have travel insurance.. Any suggestion as to best way to try to recover, at least, some of our money."
Who advised you not to travel? You might have to produce a doctor's note.
"Look at your travel insurance documentation, and call them with questions. It depends on what your policy states. Some cover cancellations ""for any reason"", some cover ""quarantine""."
"If the condo owner is decent, they should refund. If they donâ€™t tell them you will shame them on social media."
"We do not have insurance that allows us to cancel"" for any reason."" Doctor's note suggestion one I have considered - thanks for reinforcing that idea. Have rented from large condo rental consortium. Doubt if they are about public shaming, but I will give it a try.Thanks for the help."
we were able to negotiate an even trade for 5 weeks in November/December. I commend the company for being so helpful
"Glad you were able to cancel. With everything going on, it would be very inconsiderate of an owner not to let you make a change."

So tell us who treated you right
"V trips, operating out of Ponte Vedre Beach, Florida. They were helpful and easy to negotiate with. At first, they were only willing to consider rebooking 6 months out. But when I said that would not work for me, they let me name my dates. ( I had already checked availability of unit.)"
