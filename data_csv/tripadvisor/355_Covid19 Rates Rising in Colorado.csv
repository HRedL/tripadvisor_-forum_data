"This is scary. Colorado’s weekly COVID-19 count hits highest level since May as upward trend continuesMeg WingerterPUBLISHED: July 13, 2020 at 5:37 p.m. | UPDATED: July 13, 2020 at 6:36 p.m.Colorado recorded 2,743 new cases of the coronavirus in the second week of July, reaching a level not seen since early May.Sunday capped the fourth week of rising infection numbers in the state following a decline since April, reaching a level of new COVID-19 cases not seen since the week ending May 10.While Colorado is still below the late-April peak of 3,761 new infections in one week, it’s much closer than it was in early June, when the state recorded 1,135 new cases.Some of the rise in cases is due to increased testing: the positivity rate on Sunday was about half of what it was on May 10.But testing isn’t the only factor, and not all new cases are mild. The Colorado Hospital Association reported 220 people were hospitalized as of Monday afternoon. That’s the highest number of patients needing hospital-level care for the virus since June 4, though it’s only about one-fourth of the number of people hospitalized at the peak in early April.State officials attributed at least some of the increase in COVID-19 cases to people mixing more with others outside their households.PLEASE if you're planning on visiting, reconsider. It's not likely to be the trip you envision.We'd love to see you when things are under control."

"To those who insist on coming this summer, make sure everything is refundable. The writing is on the wall. I anticipate stricter restrictions re Covid19."
"I'm an out of stater, and based on my observations during the trip I took from June 25 - July 1, I'm not surprised. We had a chance, as a group, to be socially responsible. And we blew it. Too many people refusing to wear masks, in obvious mask wearing situations. For example, I'd enter a convenience mart to use the bathroom, and get a can of soda. Maybe half the people would be wearing their mask. And some of them would look at me, wearing my mask, like I was from Mars. Ugh.You might still be able to responsibly enjoy CO as a tourist, MAYBE, if you're willing to haul 30 pounds, and backpack into primitive campsites, to be isolated. Which would include being responsible with human waste, and practicing LNT. Do that for as long as you can stand it, drive home smelling like a gym locker, and self quarantine. What percentage of tourists could or would do that, though? This is assuming the state doesn't get shut down, anyway. That's my two cents"
"Steve B...Sad but true, and I like your candor. Exactly what you described is causing levels to skyrocket, yet clueless people think it doesn't apply to them. Thanks for at least being aware. It doesn't take much, but it takes everybody. Stay well."
"43 pages of obituaries in a recent Houston Chronicle edition. That's not normal.A new study from last week reports that half of Covid-19 cases are spread via people that aren't showing any signs, also known as ""Silent Spreaders"". https:/…ref-2 and https:/…This knowledge is absolutely relevant to traveling during a pandemic. It's irresponsible to put so many others at risk. People are unknowingly passing it along. That's why America is in the situation we're in. Everyone needs to do their part. Staying home is morally the right thing to do. I mean, come on, this is a travel website that is based on the people recommending travel. When the majority of people stop recommending travel, it should be a clue that something is terribly wrong. It's no different than the NFL talking about cancelling this upcoming season to fan attendance. Something ain't right!"
Gotama..that 43 page obituary was not all COVID deaths. It was a tribute to those who have passed this year.
Yeah from Texas...hot spot with little regard for the safety of Coloradodans. Sigh. Are Texans incapable of vacationing in your own state?
"The larger percentage of deaths WERE from Covid or complications caused by Covid. This is way way way above and beyond what is normal for Houston. http://news.leportale.com/doc?id=21596827680-100 deaths per day in TX just last week? Unacceptable and largely preventable if better steps were taken earlier on. We do not want this in Colorado! We care about our people and our economy and thus we can’t help but to defend our people and our state. Don’t blame us for not wanting travelers who insist on turning our state into another deathbed like TX, because unlike TX, we WILL close down our economy again to prevent more deaths. And we don't want that. The apathy I’m seeing here the past few days from mainly Texans is astounding."
