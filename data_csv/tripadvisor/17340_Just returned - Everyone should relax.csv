"Just got back and thought I would share some thoughts. I’m no expert, but I have first hand experience and not just someone posting every link they can find. I mean if it is on the internet, it has to be true, right?Any case we arrived on Sunday and had a fabulous time. Traveled from Playa del Carmen to the hotel zone with multiple stops along the way. Used Taxi, colectivo, bus. All pretty normal. Hotels were running low occupancy but still operating normally. Things seemed to change yesterday when we were departing. Seemed like half the hotel was checking out. I’m guessing the state department warning panicked the American travelers. The airport yesterday was busy. More so than It was when we arrived, but not any worse than a spring day. Check in, security, boarding, all the same. They did ask questions and there was a joke of a thermal screening, but other than that nothing out of the ordinary. There were a few people wearing masks. I mean very few. Pretty much everyone we encountered had the same view that things are being blown way out of proportion and a massive overreaction. This was the mindset of locals and tourists alike. I don’t know what the future holds for my friends in Cancun, but my fear is the the economic fall out will create conditions much worse than a few people getting sick. The workers were already working reduced schedules and there isn’t much of unemployment support and these people live mostly paycheck to paycheck. Overall it was a great trip. Hope that someday we can return."
“a few people getting sick“Let’s revisit this comment in a few months when the new case count dwarfs the current number
What was it like at Your Home airport? Any changes there?
"Blown way out of proportion...Read any story about the conditions in Italian hospitals, and you will know that this isn't being blown out of proportion. Hospitals in the US are reusing protective equipment, Doctors are getting sick.Glad you made it home safe, because you don't want to be in Mexico if/when they start getting a lot of cases. Their medical system will be quickly overwhelmed.I know you are not taking this seriously, but for everyone else's benefit, follow instructions to stay home.Edited: 10:15 am, March 21, 2020 "
"You are on another planet. This is not about “a few people getting sick”. This virus is very contagious and with about 15% of those affected requiring hospitalizations, it can quickly overburden any health system. You may not care about your health but at least take precautions not to endanger others.Edited: 10:28 am, March 21, 2020 "
"Most Mexicans live very poorly, and do not have the disposable income to travel much, buy pallets of toilet paper. So mostly stay home with family. Even on vacation. All of my friends here are just staying home, and not going out of their homes."
"I am glad you made it home, and hope that you stay healthy. I would also be interested in how the US airports were. Did you have a direct flight?Currently we are sitting on our 4/24 trip to Costa Rica. We have NO INTENTION of traveling, as I live in upstate NY and the cases are high in downstate NY. But...since insurance doesn't cover pandemics there is no immediate need to worry about canceling. Things will play out-it appears that our Atlanta to Costa Rica leg of the trip has been put on suspension anyway.Stay safe and healthy everyone!!"
"Sorry Kol. I don’t subscribe to the nonsense I see on TV. Case in point a story about a 34 year old dying. While the person tested positive, he also was recovering from cancer and had a host of other problems. Corona was the least of his issues, but it sensationalizes the story and stirs up fear. I could sit here and post links but instead I like to see things for myself. I have seen it and I’m not worried.I am more worried about the impact on the poor. Undoubtedly there will be looting and violence when money runs out because no one is working. That is a much worse alternative than a busy hospital."

Well obviously Sunngod should change his/her screen name to Superman/woman. Bullet prove right.
"Relax? Up here in Canada we have a Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, self quarantined with his 12, 11 and 6 year old kids, a fully quarantined wife who got it in England at a conference and no staff in the house. It's normalized the necessary actions for many of us. If Justin can run a country, figure out how to least 2 metres and cook, clean, parent etc. then let's get on with this. We need to stop the rhetoric that it is not necessary to get on board with stopping the spread.Don't think about yourself (and the great holiday you might have or had). Think about the people you protecting by practising what the experts are telling us to do.Pay attention to Italy and second and soon third waves. Think about friends and family, even if they are not yours, who are elderly or have compromised health, young or old. Think about others who you are protecting. As is being said all over "" Our parents and grandparents were asked to go to war and we are being asked to stay home""."
"I’m glad you were able to enjoy your vacation, despite a worldwide epidemic taking place. This nonchalant attitude of some people is precisely why the virus is spreading throughout the world."
Meant to say 'figure out how to communicate in person from 2 metres away'
"""Pretty much everyone we encountered had the same view that things are being blown way out of proportion and a massive overreaction. ""I don't think there's a single person who doesn't wish that were the case. Nothing would make me happier than for this to be nothing more than something blown out of proportion.

"I read this on CNBC a few days ago, it makes a lot of sense what Bill said. Just look how Italy is overwhelmed right now.You look at the beaches at Fort Lauderdale: Unfortunately, they're packed with 18-to-22-year-olds having the time of their lives, spreading the virus,"" he said.""They're probably OK, most of them ... but when they go home to their parents, or they go home to their loved one, or to their friend who just had breast cancer surgery and is immune-compromised: They're going to kill that person,"" Ackman said.""Everyone feels, you know, '99% chance I'll be OK!'"" he continued. ""But it's not you: It's the person you give it to. I am not going to kill my father, OK?"""
"I think Sungod should now start worrying now that he is back homeAs I understand it all 50 states have the virus. Europe is ahead of the states but yesterday Spain had five thousand new cases reportedIn the UK all bars ,restaurants and schools are closed and we await ""the storm"""
Good god take this post down. Obviously the tourists think everything is ok because only idiots are tourists right now.
We got back yesterday and I don’t want to delve into the whole coronavirus controversy travel controversy again but I did see an interesting article while down there and got the same sense from the Mexican people I talked with. Right or wrong they had a very different perspective than us. They live with a host of infectious diseases like Dengue fever for example and the amount of violence in everyday life pales the coronavirus threat a bit (which is understandable when you read the local publications and see the amount of lives lost a week to homicides).
I think we should all follow Joan S and not reply.It's just not worth it and you're only giving him/her what they want.
"The rate of violence we live with daily is sad. And I'm almost ashamed to say that over time we've become conditioned to it. I use to find it horrifying to look at the graphic pictures they put in the paper here daily. Now, it's just like, ""okay, there was another execution"" .I read an article that said this virus was bad news for the bad guys too. People staying home, bars closed......their source of income is drying up too.And, yes, we live with dengue and other infectious diseases but people are still concerned about this virus. It may be just one of many things that concern people but that concern is still very real. And remember, if you think any post or thread is inappropriate you can report it. Just click on ""report inappropriate content"" and pick a reason."
"sunloverg09: I agree with you and JoanS. This post doesn’t deserve a reply, but I will say, ‘That if ignorance is BLISS, he/she must be very happy!!"
"Joan S. Agree 100%. Did the same.Edited: 3:47 pm, March 21, 2020 "

"My fiance and I were supposed to fly down this past Tuesday and get married on the beach yesterday. We had been following the situation closely and had planned to go up until last Sunday evening. The situation was changing so rapidly we decided to cancel. It was a tough decision but one I'm glad we made. After all is said and done we'll certainly see which country handled the situation better, Mexico has taken very little precaution in comparison to the U.S and Canada, It'll be an easy comparison to make."
"I have to admit. It does get a bit out of hand when one DE is 'preferred' over another. And heaven forbid you do not agree. I am not saying what Sungod posted is what I would agree with. I also do not put certain DE's on a pedestal and only follow their ideas/suggestions of what one should do. I understand why some people come on here looking for help and guidance. They are new to travelling perhaps or just want some advice. Bottom line. Do what YOU think is right for you and your family. Heaven forbid someone says ""Yes, go ahead"" and something bad happens. Just wash your hands ok?"
"One thing I do know is no one on here speaks for the people of Cancun, not even the ex pats who live there part or full time. I appreciate contributors like Joan and Robert for their advice the can provide us travelers, but none of us can speak for the working people there. There’s way too many of us on here speculating what the best path is for Cancun both economically and pandemic wise (unfortunately no one has found the right solution there)."
czech- agree with all that! and sunngod keep speaking the truth man! Salud
I think the original poster just wanted attention and comments. This can’t be a real post. Unreal.
"TJay - sad to hear - hope all went well elsewhere. Yes - a real post with and An open forum. Prov - Cabo and Cancun?Agree Czech - but, this is an open and opinionated forum at time. Just hope that everyone gets home safely and Prov offers seats to those that need to get home."
"Seriously partygirl? I have been traveling to Cancun for years and posting here long before anyone else. I hardly need attention. I got back yesterday. My information is first hand. I’m sorry you do not like it. I posted this information to share my own personal experience. If someone else was there and saw something different, they are more than welcome to post and I would hope that they would. The value of this form is travelers helping travelers and not just one person’s opinion."
"I will contact tripadvisor and alert then that a few people are trying to shut down a valid post.As for the fearmongers, the midpoint of estimate flu deaths this season is 41,000. Should we shut down everything every year to save a few lives?How about 36,560 motor vehicle deaths in a year? Shut down driving to prevent those deaths?This is a politicized media driven hysteria event.The numbers above were just in the USA...not global numbers."
CoPilot - Yes - Please - I for one am tired of a$$Hat people on the roads!!
"""I for one am tired of a$$Hat people on the roads!!""My suggestion is to assume that people will do stupid things that may kill you.Never go through an intersection without clearing cross traffic from each side. This applies especially in Cozumel when driving north and south. Watch out for people looking at their phone and not the road."
"""I have been traveling to Cancun for years and posting here long before anyone else."" Sunngod, not really an important statistic to me but before such statements, check the facts.I find the people here are relaxed, for the most part. Of course, they are worried about their jobs but not so much how much toilet paper they can buy (and it is readily available) The latest example of the attitude here was a local I talked to yesterday working in a travel agency kiosk. (business was slow). Her English was excellent and she told me she just came back home from working in Canada because the sense of panic was just too much for her there."
"“...the midpoint of estimate flu deaths this season is 41,000”I know numbers bore people but since this was brought up it should be put in context. The mortality rate for the seasonal flu is 0.1 %, or 1 in a 1000 cases. For Covid it’s 1 % at its lowest, or 1 in 100 cases. Ten times the rate. In Italy it’s as high as 8%. I don’t know about you but when my chances of dying is ten times greater (at best) than from the flu I think it’s a little more than “media driven hysteria.” But to be honest, I really wish that’s all it is. I’d love for this to be just one big mass hysteria."
"“How about 36,560 motor vehicle deaths in a year? Shut down driving to prevent those deaths?”Car accidents occur year-round. Hospitals are not overwhelmed with a massive number of car accident victims all at once. We are trying to do the same with covid-19 by flattening the curve. It’s not a difficult concept to understand"
"""For Covid it’s 1 % at its lowest, or 1 in 100 cases.""That is why those at risk need to bear the brunt of measures taken to protect themselves...or for those in care facilities, taken by staff to protect them."
I don’t know where the 1% number is from but thats not what i see online from trusted sites
Covid also has a hospitalization rate of about 15%. It cam quickly overburden any health system.As for those saying things along the lines of “Do what YOU think is right for you and your family.” There is both and individual and collective responsibility to tale measures to limit/slow the spread of this virus. People ignoring recommendations of authorities are simply pushing governments to impose more and more restrictions on everyone.
"Meanwhile, I hope this is reason for hope. 12 cases identified so far in the region with all of them being from folks getting it from somewhere else or people directly connected to them. Here’s praying the heat and humidity slow Community transmission in the area. You have to think there’s something to that or with all the visitors from potential hotspots that Cancun has had already.https:/…2020.html"
"I just wish healthcare providers had the PPE we need. I’m being asked to reuse N95 masks. It’s pretty alarming. 3 of my coworkers including an ER doc are ill now. What’s bad is that our docs and RN’s aren’t all young, so us experienced oldies are already higher risk. We are all fighting the good fight together tho. I just ask everyone to be safe and to help protect the healthcare workers who may be taking care of you or someone you love in the near future. Oh and if anyone who works construction or does sanding/woodworking projects has any of those boxes of 3M or Milwaukee N95 masks consider donating to a local ER. Call them first. Thanks everyone and stay safe."
"I really hope this is the case but I think it’s more because testing isn’t widely available. Similar to what we saw at the beginning of this in the US. Now as we start to see testing numbers go up it will be natural to see positive results too. It’s really all about the asymptomatic spread of this thing. We have so many patient's telling us they were perfectly fine one day then boom, sick as all get out the next day. That’s unlike the flu were you can feel crappy for a few days before it gets worse. Alot of folks have zero symptoms and by current data this virus may have a 5 day asymptomatic contagious timeframe. I work at a major hospital in Chicago as an RN"
"”don’t know where the 1% number is from but thats not what i see online from trusted sites”Fatality rates vary. That’s why I said 1% at best. South Korea is about 1% but most countries are much higher. Globally it’s 4%. I guess my point was that even at its best, Covid is 10x more deadly than the seasonal flu. But that’s at its best."
"I agree the testing is probably low, but you would think with the number of foreign visitors slammed into tight resorts, eating buffet, handing drink glasses to the wait staff, etc would have spread the disease like wildfire in the region and there would have been more evidence of an outbreak in the region by now. The hospitals would have seen more of an uptake in admissions at least and would be packed with possible cases (maybe they are and it’s all a cover up for all I know?)"
Google CEBM. Center for evidence based medicine. They are keeping track of death percentages from around the globe.
"If you look at the global spread it could be that Mexico is just not hit hard...yet. My concern now is that people traveling TO Mexico are going to bring it and spread it. Some corona viruses are impacted by temps of 86 F or over but this one doesn't seem to be necessarily following the rules. If you want my honest opinion as an RN, I think that the numbers will go up in Mexico because of tourism. If it’s already there, it’s there. Everyday I pray this thing slows down. I don’t even want to imagine the Mexico healthcare system if it hits them. I have many friends in the Akumal area (locals and expats alike) And I’m really hoping to God you are right."
"Senora Fabuloso,Exactly and the Mexican Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said, “If it were technically necessary to consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance we would have to take into account not that Mexico would bring the virus to the United States, rather that the United States could bring it here”.https:/…You can tell from when that article was publish the rise in cases to the current cases today from the link gardengirlie posted.Angie."
"Not necessarily if the majority are taking the virus home after 7 days on average. I think people may be sick but having mild cases and don’t know because they are t being tested. Especially if an economic hardship may force workers in Mexico to keep working even if they are sick. Mid-March is when US really started testing so a possible long incubation period could be showing delayed results in Mexico. I would watch for places like Mexico City to start showing higher numbers. If it’s going to hit Mexico I would think the enormous density of folks in Mexico City may be impacted the most. I really do hope that high temp of 86 F or more does slow this thing down, but the increasing numbers in other warm climate countries is not giving me much hope"
"https://medium.com/@jpsmithalt/hold-the-line-17231c48ff17New reality for the foreseeable futureEdited: 12:05 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Thank you Senora for all your input on here, & what you do day in & day out to help the sick. Be safe!"
"Typically all coronaviruses or influenza tend to diminish in warmer weather but the reasoning is really unknown for sure. Dr. Fauci said he hopes that warmer weather will “diminish” this a bit but no evidence to prove that since this is a new virus. We are learning as we go, comparing to past outbreaks and cautiously hoping. Look up what scientists know about all coronavirus vs this one. It’s a fluid situation with this one"
"Thanks Henry, there is truly a difference between panic and preparedness. I can’t panic or else I will not want to go to work. But I am prepared, staying inside with no contact when I’m not at work. Not traveling, have food and TP but not hoarding. Preparedness is staying put not being in groups anywhere right now if you can avoid it. It’s really also to protect those healthcare workers who must use public transport to get to the hospitals to take care of those who are sick. Everyone needs to remember that and it may take people getting a lot more sick than they thought they would just having a “mild case” for that to convince them. Most mild cases in those over 40 aren’t as mild as people think in terms of symptoms."
Sunngod thanks for this post. I always like to see the other perspective of things. Is the virus bad? Yes. Should precautions be taken? Absolutely. Let’s not forget that Italy has the second oldest population in the world and therefore they’re more likely to have folks who are susceptible to this virus and there towns / cities are mostly clustered together causing the virus to be transmitted more easily. It should also be mentioned that most people recover from this virus something around 85% or so and another fact in 2018 60k Americans alone died from the flu just for perspective. I do hope that this is being blown out of proportion and that the world can go back to what it use to be very soon.

Hahaaa - you two are funny :-)
"No need to fantasize when you can afford it and have been traveling that way for years. You sound like you're jealous. Don't care what you think or any one for that matter, we all can have our own opinion. That's the way we travel."
"Sunngod, you’re right- you are no expert. The real experts say stay home."
"FWIW people are getting the flu and getting in car accidents in addition to COVID, so the disease still puts a huge strain on healthcare since it's in addition to the first two, not in lieu of them.Not sure how this can be defined as political since the entire world is experiencing the same problems and acting accordingly regardless of political affiliation. Can you please enlighten us?At this point, I would be more concerned about traveling to places like MX and potentially spreading the illness to workers and then their families, as they likely dont have the healthcare resources to be treated, let alone to pay for it. A few weeks without tourism doesnt have nearly the potential death toll as infecting the population. If a housekeeper or dishwasher at a resort comes down with severe COVID and doesn't have health insurance, will they be treated? I know many in USA don't have health insurance but hospitals are not allowed to refuse treatment, not sure the same can be said for MX."
"""If a housekeeper or dishwasher at a resort comes down with severe COVID and doesn't have health insurance, will they be treated?"" Most likely yes. Many have the Social Security healthcare but if not, with the new Presidents plan, they will be treated at other hospitals. Have not tried it yet but said to even be available to resident expats, with proper documents."" I know many in USA don't have health insurance but hospitals are not allowed to refuse treatment, not sure the same can be said for MX."" I had always thought the same until I was being treated for a circulation problem at an expensive local hospital and the doctor suggested , to save the high costs, he send me to a doctor friend at a local specialty hospital. Told him I didnt think I could go there and he told me, they cannot turn anyone down. I went and excellent treatment at almost no cost."
"For every single county in the world, except China, it was introduced by travelers taking it there, so that's obviously how it spreads. It doesn't spontaneously generate. I'm counting anyone who traveled to China and then back home as a traveler, whether it was a tourist or family.I don't understand the belief that it is killed by warm weather, right now it is about 90F on average in the afternoon in Singapore, and has been for a while and they just had their most cases yet. Most of those had contacted it while traveling, but some had not, so it is being community spread even in hot weather."
"I read somewhere that it's not the high temps that might be a deterrent to the virus but rather high temps AND high humidity. It said that the virus gets sort of trapped in the humidity and although it will still spread in the air, it does so for a shorter distance. I think I read it was like 2 feet and not 6. I wish I could remember where I read it but I can't. If I come across it I'll post the link."

"I was just pointing out what I read. And I said ""might"" be a deterrent. I didn't say it was a deterrent."
"Wow, I would love to go into details about all the reasons why the OP is just wrong on so many levels but I really feel it would just fall on deaf ears. The overall sentiment is just sad, and unfortunately shared by too many people in the US. This kind of attitude is one of many reasons the US will not be able to contain this. I guess its herd immunity for you and who cares about the loss of life right? Just sad."
"Citing Singapore does not necessarily illustrate your point. Singapore is a crossroads for so many, especially visitors from China (54 cases today - 48 imported (https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…). There is no doubt that people can still bring in the virus from other areas into an area and immediate transmission can still occur. However, what we don't have is widespread community transmission like we've seen in certain latitudes like Korea, Wuhan, Iran, Europe, New York and Washington State. Don't count out the heat and humidity hindering widespread community transmission."
"""Don't count out the heat and humidity hindering widespread community transmission.""I'm keeping my fingers and toes crossed this is the case. It just might save us here in Cancun from widespread transmission if it is. Because if there's one thing Cancun is, it's humid."

You all should know resorts are closing down anyway in Cancun. I canceled my trip for mid April at paradisus Playa and just got an email from them saying they are shutting down thru the end of May. I wouldn’t pretend nothing is going on. Hotels themselves are keeping people not understanding the seriousness of this out by just shutting down
"I don’t understand why you would lump all of the US with this guy, I assure you, he is in the minority.It’s easy to generalize though, but not really accurate."
Coming in Wednesday. Tulum Time
The original post and this thread should be DELETED. It is terribly irresponsible and dangerous.
Thank you for posting this!!!
"As I stated before, I did reach out to the TA staff to have them reinstate the original post...which was fine. If you disagree that is fine but having the post removed was an incorrect move.People need to get over their hysteria over this event and the associated knee-jerk economy destroying actions taken."
"Odd, my post seemed to vanish for a few hours???"
Nice try folks but I will get post 91 reinstated.
"Well CP. I do agree with you on a couple things, the OP post should be re-instated, to each his own regarding their opinions. And, I do agree that there's much hysteria involved with the pandemic, revolving around fear, panic, hysterical hoarding, xenophobia, and folks taking nonsensical, illogical thoughts and behaviors to extremes. However, and you know this was coming, there is a pandemic, there is a sickening and deadly contagion virus upon the land infecting people in almost every corner of the world. The economic balance between saving, sparing, and containing the virus is of the utmost importance as is the search for a cure, God willing, perhaps a concept you don't share, or as hard science has told the world that the mounting sick and dead are not mirages, and that swift, appropriate action needs to be taken. Now you can deny Climate Change, the COVID-19, or that you would rather the economy be protected from those that provide it but I can assure you that the world is not flat. And, just as you and others have a right to your opinion, others here do as well. There's not much use in having a job or a 401K if you're dead.

"The opinions of others...even if wrong...does not give them the right to have my opinion silenced.Man caused climate change is a hoax. The Earth is not flat.

I am not having posts that are contrary to my view removed.Edited: 6:00 pm, March 24, 2020 "
I think the difference is that claiming the earth is flat isn't causing anyone to behave in ways that are risky or dangerous to others (unless they die laughing). Spreading misinformation or advice about a pandemic is dangerous.
Spreading hysteria is also a bad thing.

There will always be those who stick their heads in the sand. Thankfully most people are responsible and act appropriately.
"You know CP, I really don't like seeing opinionated posts taken down either, I didn't think that #91 was all that bad, I didn't agree with some of it but it wasn't worthy of being burned and filed into Trip Advisor Area 51,  And, now that we can both agree that the Flat Earth folks are living on the edge, just maybe we can talk about hysteria? You know, like shouting fire in a crowded theater, or telling folks that it's safe to travel to foreign lands on a travel forum while there is a worldwide virus pandemic ongoing, and many governments, including our own, are making not traveling internationally a recommendation. A couple of months ago, your views may have made some sense to me, I try and be reasonable, but not now. Heck, I don't believe the government or the leaders in Statehouse want a whole lot of interstate travel let alone international travel now.  Or calling, yes, I'll take the bait, COVID-19, the Chinese virus, because putting a nice xenophobic hysterical label on something attracts more attention, and invites extremists to positively identify new victims of their hatred much like we saw after 9/11 when many folks automatically presumed all Middle Eastern backgrounds or religion were in on the tragedy. Now, let's have some idiots make presumptions on people from the Far East or their descendants that have been in this country since the 1800's. I certainly don't want to see you silenced however, I view your Cancun posts as both informative and at times naive, sort of like a CP abroad. Peace out amigo. Your circuits dead, there's something wrong... ;-)"

My first comment ever removed! World Traveler. Double asshat in response to your post.
"Dangers, you’re my hero. To all those who are genuinely taking this thing seriously and are worried about travel enough to postpone, I get it. I do believe social distancing is one factor that may work. Stay safe and keep others safe. To those who continue thinking this is nothing more than hysteria, I wish to god you were right. I would love nothing more than to wake up one morning and have this thing “disappear, like magic.” It would make me beyond thrilled to say, “hey, you were right. It was just hysteria.”ETA: I don’t believe post should be taken down for differing opinions either.Edited: 8:13 am, March 25, 2020 "
"KD, Not sure what explanation you are looking for. This was my first hand account of what I saw and felt in Cancun. This is the Cancun forum and that is where I was. I can't speak to what is going on in LA or Wuhan. I am not there. I really don't understand your troll comment when I was actually there. I'm not reposting internet links or making up hysteria. Had I saw people in peril or distress, I would have stated exactly that. I'm sorry that is not in line with what you see on CBS or in your area. I hope you and your family make it through and some day can visit a Cancun that was still in all its glory as it was when I visited."
"sunngod... People will always take the opportunity to ridicule others. I traveled 2 weeks ago & I was ridiculed on this forum because after I had traveled, I discouraged others to do the same. While I was on vacation, I witnessed how rapidly things were changing due to the pandemic (travel warnings, closures, social distancing, school cancellations, etc) so my opinion regarding traveling changed 100%. My guess is if I would have have shared sentiments similar to yours, I would have also been criticized."
"sunngod, would you agree that even though you were just here, the situation in Cancun changes daily? So maybe your info isn't accurate as to the situation today?"
"Definitely not! First-hand or any other news from last week - or even yesterday - should be c confirmed today.Sunngod does have a ""history"" here...Edited: 10:22 am, March 25, 2020 "
"Bluewater_646, Totally agree. I'm just wondering if sunngod will agree also."
"Yes, my first hand knowledge that was much different than what our experts were stating is now several days old. I will switch to posting only links I can find on the internet."
"sunngod, I asked a question in a very polite way. Too bad you couldn't have just answered my question without a veiled reference to my behavior. I guess expecting that you could put your obvious dislike for me aside was naive on my part. I won't make that mistake again."

"Agree, JoLeen. Hoping TA will shut this down soon."
The doomers got it closed once. I contacted TA about it (as others may have as well) and it was reopened.
"Really love the ""my view is the only view"" by our 'experts'. Cracks me up that with the exception of Joan, none of these people have been to Cancun recently (if ever). And considering that even Joan isn't seeing the doom and gloom outside of effects of the lack of vacationers is having, I find it fascinating that a few of you continue to say that I am wrong.Unless you are there or have been there recently, it would benefit everyone greatly if you refrain from confusing facts with your opinions. Why would TA close down a thread that is first hand actual information? Seems to me to go against what TA was founded on."

"Your statements are irresponsible and one of the reasons this virus continues to spread at this rate. I am a nurse in NYC and it terrifies me to think that you will be the reason more people will die because they think this is being blown out of proportion. The father of one of my coworkers just passed away from COVID-19 and he was a healthy man. I pray that no one in your family is impacted in this way for you to learn the truth of what this virus can do. Be more careful of your statements, words matter."
"sunngod, You don't know me. You don't have any idea how this current situation is affecting me or those that I care about. How dare you be so presumptuous to assumed that you know what effects this may be having on my daily life. Or the daily life of those I care about. Or what I worry about. This is a resort city. It was built to be a tourism hub. Without tourists coming here and spending money, there isn't an industry that some how isn't effected. So the fact that we have no tourists here is a HUGE concern for everyone that lives here whether they work directly in tourism or not. No tourists...workers have no money. They can't pay for a taxi ride, they can't buy food beyond the basics, they can't buy clothing, shoes or other apparel, they can't pay tuition to send their kids to a school that isn't public (public school system here sucks), they can't take their kids to Parque de las Palapas and rent a tiny motorized car, they can't go out to eat, they can't buy gas for their cars, they can't pay rent.And they can't do a whole lot more.And for everything that they can't do another list exists of things that the people they'd normally be paying can't afford to do. It goes on and on. You may think that I don't see anything beyond the hotels closing and occupancy rates but in this city that's where everything starts.You came here and stayed in your little vacation bubble. You took the bus and collective and think you experienced real life here. You have no idea what people's real lives are like here. You think some hotel workers is going to tell how bad it is? Think again. They may tell you they're worried about a shutdown but I don't very much they opened up to you and told you all of their many concerns. No. They didnt. Because you're a tourist and the resorts want to keep you happy. They don't need you thinking about bad things. They want you happy and spending money. You have absolutely no right to use my name and reference what you think I'm seeing when I look at what's going on around me. Kindly refrain from referencing me in any of your future posts. No one here believes you know anything about the current situation in Cancun. Don't use my name to try and make your point. I hope you see this before it gets deleted. End of rant......"
"Okay - insults are going in all directions. Now if Beach is whom and doing what they claim - well - gotta vent out someplace. Then back to work.

But if you have a child who doesn't have many clothes that haven't been outgrown you do need to think about those things. I'm saying that no tourists being here has a trickle down effect effect that affects everyone in one way or another.I was making the point that I found it offensive that sunngod was using my name and assuming he knew what I was seeing on a day to day basis. He doesn't have the first clue about what concerns me or what observations I make here. I'm well aware that everyone is suffering but so are the people here.

Well - I’ve got nothing much to say to that :-)Hand me downs - yes - there’s a family someplace. Been there in my life as I’m sure many others have also - it’s never ending. One good thing that is more prevalent down there - is shelf milk. Youngsters up here really don’t know the uses of shelf milk.
Arrived in Tulum and the weather is perfect
"CO_Pilot 54,I love how you talk about “spreading hysteria” from the comfort of Colorado Springs. You are no where near NYC which has gone from 2 COVID -19 cases on March 2nd to 24,000+ cases as of 12 o’clock today. Why don’t you come spend some time in a NYC hospital with me while I care for my patients? God willing there will be still be healthy nurses and doctors to care for you and yours if you should come down with the virus."
"Zeeka, I'll freely admit that I can't drink the boxes milk here. I buy the refrigerated kind but I'm not that much of a milk drinker to begin with. But, yes, I agree. It comes in very handy when people are staying home and not going out daily. And kids here, well, for most of them it's all they know.And thankfully, although it can be hard to find pasta, beans, rice, instant soup and a few other things, pretty much all stores have a good supply of that boxed milk."
"Prov1....I’m at home, the weather and my conscience is clear"
They say winning the lottery tends to magnify a persons character. A jerk becomes a bigger jerk whereas a compassionate person becomes more compassionate. Apparently a pandemic does the same thing.
"BeachPlease, maybe you should reread your condensending comments. To want to educate ppl is one thing, to talk down to ppl, is just wrong. If you were truly coordinating respirators for sick kids, get the hell off Trip Advisor and this ridiculous thread. This is just mindless blather compared to what's important. I am retired, so am doing nothing important and am self quarantining because I've been in Mexico. Ya wanna be mad at someone, be mad at customs for not looking twice at anyone who came thru. There was no screening coming back into the country. None!! That angers me! I didn't think Sungod was telling anyone to travel, just what she seen. I witnessed the same thing. All was fine and then it wasn't. I was there before any of this got remotely bad and watched as they got the news of what was going on. Sad for them, sad for us, sad for everyone. I live in an area that has only 4 cases, but our state is on lockdown. The downstaters will treat it like a vacation and come to the area I live and bring it with them. So I am now in the same position as the Mexicans. My area needs the tourist money, but for now stay the hell home. I think Sungod got a beatdown for that post, for something unintentional. But I'm wrong alot too, so who knows."

Co Pilot - Keep speaking the truth! Tons of doomers out there and are jealous of the people who speak the truth and have fun in life. Salud!
"Thanks for the kind words. I am still concerned about how things are going in some US states where the idea is to just try to keep everyone at home rather than implementing very strong measures to protect those at most risk.Yes this means that some people (mostly not in a care facility and able to be mostly self-reliant) have to make the most changes to protect themselves.Add in the enhanced TV and radio messages to have everyone become more cautious about not becoming infected with any virus and please don't go to work or out and about if you are sick...and we can live normal lives.Excluding anyone whose health status suggests not flying, there may still be 250 million or more people in the USA who can safely travel to Cancun/Riviera Maya/Cozumel."
"“I have no desire to go to New York City. Perhaps the mayor or Governor should have implemented ""shelter in place"" a month or two sooner rather than allow people to spread germs packed as closely as they are.“ So much ignorance parading as expertise. I was in NYC 2.5 weeks ago, helping an elderly relative prepare just as the rest of the country was. It was business as usual there. The extent of the New Rochelle cluster was just coming to light. NYC had few cases. If the governor issued restrictive orders a month or 2 ago, they’d have had to be psychic. If they had done so based on the possibility of things to come, the same uninformed poster as above would have called it “hysteria”. Not understand how quickly things happened there is a pathetic inability to comprehend the exponential nature of this virus’ spread."
"I usually appreciate your your posts, copilot. But this is way over your head. I’m sure I’m repeating previous posts, but it’s about containing the spread of the virus, not will I get sick. You are in the with Sunngod, and Provo, whatever the helll. I can appreciate different opinions, but one can be critical of those opinions. That is is fair. Full disclosure,I r only been traveling to Mexico since 2004."
"“ Add in the enhanced TV and radio messages to have everyone become more cautious about not becoming infected with any virus and please don't go to work or out and about if you are sick...and we can live normal lives.”And just ignore that pesky 14 day incubation period and the people who get very ill or die who don’t seem to be at high risk. Leave your elderly and vulnerable...you know...wherever you have to leave them put away. And go to work and have a great vacation. Delusional and fully irrational. Let me guess, though...things in your area look like they’ll be ready to be back to normal some time right around, let me guess, Easter."
"Here are the data from my state, lest anyone tries to get away with continuing to say this is only about the elderly or vulnerable. Remember, we still have a major testing shortage so only the sickest are being tested:“While the data shows [sic] the virus continues to pose the greatest health risks to older patients, more than half of the state’s cases involve patients between the ages of 20 and 54, Hogan said Wednesday, citing health department data. He said the “vast majority” of Marylanders infected with the coronavirus are in their 40s.”Edited: 10:53 pm, March 25, 2020 "

"No, he has a point. Then again I'm not disagreeing with a lot of the arguments here. If this becomes where there are 40,00 deaths from COVID19 each year like the Flu especially among our elderly. Does that become the new normal? I'm with you, I just like to hear different opinions. This is a sneaky virus when statistics show one in five show no symptoms but they can infect so many. That's a big difference.."
"The data for flue deaths are for a yearly cycle, from Oct to March. Covid death data is a month of data, and growing exponentially.

"“For all those critical of my view of this event, where is your compassion for the 41,000 flu deaths this year?“The compassion, Red Herring Man, is in getting vaccinated (which you cannot do for Covid-19) and not moving through the world while ill, which doesn’t account for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread of Covid-19. The compassion is in supporting good healthcare options and better access to medical care for all. Your projection of your own lack of concern for others’ welfare and potential exposure does not reveal anything about others’ compassion."
>>Look at the facts. Hospitals are mostly empty besides normal emergencies. Go drive to your nearest one and take a look. We are still free to travel wherever we would like. Step back and look instead of listening to the media. <<Even scarier to see such naïveté...
Empty hospitals???? Check out the lines in NYC. They can't even begin to practice social distancing.Sad...and a global problem. Sensitivity is important now.
"I'm a pharmacist in UK, those playing down the seriousness of this situation are ignorant fools - its precisely this level of stupidity that is helping spread this virus and cause avoidable deaths.A few months ago when it was limited to China it was fair to criticise hysteria in countries with no cases, the situation has changed.Perhaps when its you or someone you know, you might wake up and realise this.TA - CLOSE THIS TOPIC"
That’s another 919 deaths reported in Italy over the last 24 hours. The people in this thread that are not taking this seriously and travelling to the area are just putting other people’s life’s in danger. I hope it doesn’t hit where you live as badly as it effecting parts of Spain and Italy. Both countries are under a strict lock down just now imagine the death tally if there was no lock down. A lot of irresponsible posts in this thread.

"Prov1, I don’t have to take a trip to my nearest hospital. I work in a hospital in NYC and unlike you I can speak to on this subject. Hospitals, doctors and nurses are drowning under the sea of patients! We are doing our best with the little that has been given to us by that person in the White House.

"Sunngod,I want to see if you’re capable of intubating yourself while simultaneously putting yourself on a ventilator (that probably won’t be available for you) when you’re struggling for your next breath. Bravery will have nothing to do with it."
"What is the percentage of those that get the virus that need intubation that are under 50 and in great health? Pretty small, right? I'll take those odds. If we were talking Ebola, probably not so much."

"Raymond P / Post 193 - I agree with you, and miss those days."
We are supposed to be going to Cancun on the 7th of June. My wife received a letter yesterday advising her to stay at home for 12 weeks so it looks like that’s not going to happen.
"Just in case anyone needs an example of how this can affect a young person, my friend in his mid-30’s posted this yesterday. He is one of 4 people I know with the virus.“Update on my health for anyone interested: it's now been 12 days since onset of Covid symptoms and 9 days since test confirmation of the virus. Symptoms have been dynamic day to day. There were days I didn't feel like leaving my bed was an option. There were days I felt like I could go run, but then got winded just taking a shower. It's a rollercoaster. At its peak I was bed ridden. Night sweats half the nights.The biggest takeaway after this long, is the damage I feel to my lungs. Everything I cough up has blood in it now. I wish I was exaggerating when I say it's not a small amount, but it's a concerning amount. I'm very lucky to be around someone that can give me medical advice and they say it's ok, and likely just damaged tissue being shed. I know that my airways are damaged. I know that my breathing is heavily impacted and might stay that way for a little bit. I do think I'm entering into the final phase. My energy is up on average, my temp is down on average, and I'm clearing a lot out of my System.I hope this helps clear up how this effects your average young adult and what you might expect or what others might be going through.”"
"Thanks for sharing Chris. It seems some feel they are immune due to being younger and healthy, so I think that's an important message for many. I hope your friends have a full recovery and continue to improve every day."
"How it effects person to person is different. In young, healthy, not overweight you should be fine with no underlying health conditions. Spreading fear and fake news is not the way to go"
"Prov1 that is incorrect. And even if it was, what about the rest of the population? Fake news? Come back to reality."
"Poster #205 must be a troll, pure and simple. There is no other reason for someone to be posting information that is wrong and dangerous to others. TA needs to find a way to stop allowing posts like that."
"Chris,Thanks for sharing your friend's story. It's a horrible one that many share unfortunately. I wish him a speedy recover. And, of course, wish you continued good health. PROV1_ASU isn't a troll. He's just extremely self centered and doesn't care what happens to other people or how his actions affect others. He got to take his previous vacation and that's all that matters. Guess he never heard the phrase ""What goes around comes around"".Edited: 5:23 pm, March 29, 2020 "

"Yes, I've heard that is the case in other states also, a large percentage are under the age of 50. Chris' post was an actual real life experience of a friend so I'm not sure how someone feels remotely justified with the accusation of spreading fake news and fear when it's a true story. Even if someone is young, healthy and will be ""fine"" after getting the virus, it sure doesn't seem like a pleasant experience to go through. Even if there are no symptoms as some have experienced, there is still the possibility of being contagious to family, friends and healthcare workers. We all (mostly) realize that. It is really unproductive to feed the negativity with further responses when 33,901 families around the world have had to bury their loved ones, that we know of as of this date. The facts can speak for themselves regardless of opinions. Stay safe everyone."
"SS, incredible humble message. Totally agree. Stay well all."
"Prov1 is a classic contrarian. They're all about saying anything to the contrary, whether they actually believe it or not .It's really irrelevant to them."
"Prov has no moral compass.Money can't buy that, its instilled."
My current fascinations are PROV1 on TripAdvisor & “Tiger King” on Netflix. Both are intriguing enigmas.
"rg1099,Thanks for the laugh this morning! I am right there with you!"
What would really be an exciting show would be Prov1 offering up his/ her private plane for a rescue to help others return to wherever. It could be a reality series - who will they rescue next? We could also track his/ her flight on radar24.com!

"Well said, Denise. Seems some can just whine and complain and point fingers because THEY did no do the jobs they were elected to do."
"Here’s some excerpts from another friend-“Today, our 18 year old daughter was diagnosed with the coronavirus and pneumonia in both lungs. We can’t see her and it’s terrifying.”A few days later...”(name redacted) was moved to the ICU yesterday and put on a ventilator. She is sedated and vitals are good. We anticipate her being on the ventilator for several days in hopes that her lungs heal. She also started hydrochloroquine yesterday as well so we are hoping to see some positive results from that as well. Unfortunately we are still not able to see her. Thank you for all of the prayers and thank you to the beautiful strangers who are caring for our baby. These nurses are going out of their way just to hold the phone up to her ear so we can talk to her a few times a day.”A few days later...“We were able to FaceTime her today which was horrible and amazing all at the same time. The doctor said sometimes hearing your loved ones can help people fight a little bit harder. They are going to try to lower the sedation medication again today. Yesterday when they tried her vitals dropped and she wasn’t ready to do all the work that the ventilator is doing for her.“———————Anyone still skeptical, please understand that I was planning on being the LAST person to accept the full danger of this pandemic, as I had a trip to Mexico planned in April, and I wasn’t going to let some little virus that seemed to only affect old people (or so I thought!) stop me. But as I saw the numbers creep higher and closer, and then suddenly and exponentially shoot up, it became apparent that I probably wasn’t going to Mexico. Now I look back at that mindset and understand that it was out of the question all along. And then I saw my local hospitals overflowing, and lines out to the street and around the corner just to have your vitals taken for permission to simply enter. Nobody has supplies. Nurses are wearing bandanas. Hospitals are renting refrigerated semi trucks to use as overflow morgues. I’ve seen pictures of convention centers being prepared with thousands of cubicles and cots, but no medical capabilities, because it’s a room to put dying people....and there’s still folks out there skeptical that this is really a real thing that they need to deal with in real reality."

"Thank you again Chris for sharing your friends experiences with everyone, as heartbreaking as they may be. It is a hard dose of reality for sure. Also, I appreciate your humility in being willing to adjust your initial perception and attitude about the situation and making a fact-based decision. That is quite admirable, as some seem unwilling to do so. Hoping for full recovery for your friends, and continued health to you as well."
"Denise P, that guy in the White House has done a spectacularly bad job of managing this crisis. His inconsistent messaging inspired others to not take the crisis seriously and ignore health warnings. The failure to ramp up testing and follow pandemic response plans in the early stages of the outbreak rest squarely with this administration and its leader who denied the problem for far too long.I don’t think most Americans realize what a hole they have been put in and how different the outcome could have been. The border between Canada and the US was not closed to protect Americans from Canadians but vice versa."

I don’t think the Cancun travel forum is the appropriate place for people to share their opinions regarding American leadership. Find a political forum to share your views.
Please STOP posting on this thread. The Topic is misleading to say the least.
"Chris,Sorry to hear about your friend. Assuming that it was your friend and you are not just repeating a story. In any case a loss of life is tragic, but the reality is that we will all die. That is the inevitability of life. I don't know the nature of the individual or what led to their condition, but people die every day. With this current condition, it is highlighted even more. The reality is we can't hide this out. The common cold, influenza, SARS, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, etc. exist and will continue to exist. You simply cannot hide and think they will go away. This current version is no different. It is here. It will run it's course and it will go away. The question is how to deal with it and what it will look like to get past it. I realize that there are hot spots and those areas should be avoided. NY, Northern Italy, North Korea are places that I would avoid. Short of that, I would use my best judgement. Cancun is not a place I would avoid. Will it occur there? Sure, why wouldn't it. Will it be a hot sport? Probably not. Climate seems to play a big part in the intensity and you would never describe the Cancun climate as being similar to those. I say this as someone who is a realist and looks to the future. I see the economic disaster as a worse disaster because it will impact more than those with a weakened immune system and those working in the healthcare world. I think the loss of life from hunger, poverty, and violence as being potentially worse and on a much larger scale and longer reaching than hiding from something that you can't avoid or control. This is particularly focused on Cancun specifically where the wages are incredibly low and the vast majority of the population literally lives pay check to pay check. Of course this is all my opinion and you are free to think and feel as you wish."
"Sunngod, that is stupendously bad advice.‘Hide it out’ is exactly what health authorities in the US and Mexico are asking people to do. Your comparisons to other conditions are pointless and illogical. The flu does not have the potential to overwhelm hospitals and icu’s in the next few months.Best advice for people anywhere in the US and Mexico is to follow the advice and directives from their respective health authorities. And right now that messaging is pretty consistent; stay home, avoid non-essential travel, practice social distancing."
"So what is your advice, Sungod. Should we just shrug it off with an ""oh well, we all eventually die anyway"" attitude and go about our business, spreading it everywhere and overwhelming the hospitals and healthcare workers? Hot spots are hot spots because people went about their business as though nothing was happening. Do we really want to create hot spots everywhere?"

I just did a rough translation thx
"That list looks very similar to the deemed essential and excluded industries here too. Very good common sense. (flies a bit in the face of all the people crowing how this is 'ruining the whole economy!)One thing though, a group of 50 people is a high number- they will likely lower that soon. They made it a rule at my company-no meetings or gatherings of more than 6 people- I think the official provincial 'rule' is 10."
"Yep Rissask 50 people. I shrug it off and put it on the ""This Is Mexico"" pile.As absurd as it may sound, sunngod is right, Mexicans don't like being told what to do. So I guess it's a compromise on the part of our government.."
"World Traveler- What I read from Sungod is usually interesting and knowledgeable and sometimes flavored with a bit of intelligent humor. When you post a derogatory comment about someone you might try reading it back a couple of times and then delete the part that can show ignorance.The reason that I add the following is just to show that there is always someone else that has been there, done that.As to the World Traveler designation without seeing your TA travel map I would say that perhaps you should look at a true world traveler's map by glancing at mine. 6 continents and have flown over the 7th.Oh, I might add. I am sure that it is nice to meet you.Edited: 4:47 pm, April 02, 2020 "
Missed my edit.. Miguel A. Keep up the wonderful posts.
"""Food and non-alcoholic beverages industry,""Miguel, excellent post!! I heard today that all of the breweries were shutting down but wasn't sure if that was true. But I'm guessing based on the list you posted that it would be accurate as there doesn't seem to be anything relating to alcoholic beverages that would seem that industry essential. Would you agree or an I missing something?"
Joan- did you see the posts (might have been in a different thread?) about how cutting off the supply of alcohol can have very adverse effects on society when some people who are dependent upon it have medical issues when they suddenly stop drinking?Also the increase of methanol poisonings.
"""Yep Rissask 50 people. I shrug it off and put it on the ""This Is Mexico"" pile.As absurd as it may sound, sunngod is right, Mexicans don't like being told what to do. So I guess it's a compromise on the part of our government.""""Our number for max allowable people in one 'room' started higher, I think 250, then went to 100, then 50 I think, then 10. I think most other places in Canada and the US followed a similar pattern.So I would bet the recommendations there will also decrease as more cases come to light."
I did. I think I actually read it in the Isla Mujeres forum. I wasn't really making a point about that one way or another. The way I read the list it sounds as if the food and non-alcoholic industry has been deemed essential but there's no mention as to the production of alcoholic beverages being deemed essential. I wasn't making an argument one way or another about whether a ban is a good idea. I was just curious whether Miguel (or anyone really) read it the same way. I know they are completely banning the sale of all alcohol in Merida starting tomorrow. A friend sent me photos of the people buying cart fullof alcohol stocking up before the ban goes into place. I'd post them here if TA allowed photos.
"You may be right @Rissask. I clarify that 50 people must sit (or stand) 2 meters away from each other (that's the law but again, #ThisIsMexico.

"Hi @Joan! Some interesting info:You're right the alcohol 'industry' is not considered essential, so the rumor goes than in Monterrey (a huge beer production area) the factories are being closed. So the stores will be selling whatever alcohol they have. What would happen after we can only speculate. My first question would be if the distribution trucks can circulate unhindered. I read this in the comment section of Facebook so, huge caveat emptor.Edited: 6:57 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Here's an article I found.

Also, there are reports that beer production hasn’t actually stopped at all Mexican breweries despite the order.Lastly, and perhaps most relevant, the three major beer companies operating in Mexico — Anheuser-Busch InBev, Heineken and Constellation Brands — are believed to be lobbying furiously to have beer production deemed essential by the Mexican government, as it is during shutdowns in the U.S.On Thursday, both Beer Marketer’s Insights and Beer Business Daily publications reported that the Mexican government announced Tuesday a nationwide suspension of all nonessential activities through April. Essential industries included “non-alcoholic” beverage manufacturers, but not alcoholic beverage manufacturers, both outlets reported.“This could end up being a big deal, but it could also just be a blip on the radar,” Harry Schuhmacher, editor and founder of Beer Business Daily, said in an interview.Even if the Mexican beer industry shuts down for one month, Schuhmacher said there’s a good chance American consumers will barely be affected due to the reserves already on hand. Were a shutdown to persist, however, the supply chain may be affected.“In that case there would definitely be a big short-term impact, and then they’d have to ramp up production quickly because we’re going into the summer months — though we don’t know what the ‘new normal’ is yet,” he said.Constellation Brands, whose beer division is based in Chicago, makes Modelo Especial, Corona, Pacifico and Victoria, among other brands, for the American market. Anheuser-Busch InBev makes those same brands for the rest of the world and Estrella Jalisco for the U.S. Heineken owns brands that include Dos Equis and Tecate. None of the three companies offered comment Thursday.Of the three, Constellation has the most on the line. Its beer business largely amounts to making its portfolio of Mexican brands just over the Texas border, then importing them to the United States. They have been among the nation’s most popular beers even as the overall industry struggles."
"In the UK we have a maximum two people together in public unless family,What is worse is a maximum ten people at a funeral. Not nice and people dying of the virus are dying in hospital alone with no relative to see your body before burial.A good reason for everyone to forget travel and isolate"
"sunngod, -Yes these are people I personally know who are infected, not a news story. And I’m up to 5 I can name right now, and maybe a sixth I’m forgetting.-We must differ in our understanding of how contagion works, based on your statement that we can’t hide from this.-Yes, we will all die. I think most of us would prefer to put that off for as long as possible. I think if one possesses this attitude, then they are mostly free to apply it to their own circumstances, but to assume the whole of society should adopt this mindset as well is unhealthy by definition."
"Since the idea of alcohol being considered essential or nonessential is being discussed, I just want to mention that in most states in the US, cannabis (marijuana) has been deemed essential and the dispensaries are allowed to stay open (curbside pickup), as well as delivery. It’s very refreshing to see the laws and attitudes change for the better!Mexico is also about to legalize cannabis at the end of the month as well, for anyone not paying attention. And I’m guessing that not even the virus will stall the legislation, because of how sternly the wording in the (already) time extension was.I think that a better case can be made for cannabis being considered “essential”, based on the medical benefits that are widely enjoyed by its users, but I also think alcohol should remain accessible because whether we like it or agree with it, some people do depend on it, whether that’s by way of addiction or simply stress management. And if groceries are still available, alcohol should be too, because it’s just another consumable product, not to mention the businesses will need all the revenue they can get in order to make it through this, in some cases."
"In today's Riviera Maya News:Grupo Modelo to halt beer production in compliance with non-essential business activityBY RIVIERA MAYA NEWS ON APRIL 3, 2020Mexico City, Mexico — Grupo Modelo reports that as of April 5, the company will complete the process of suspending its beer production and marketing operations as part of the dictated sanitary emergency decree announced by the federal government to stop the spread of the coronavirus.“Grupo Modelo announces that this Sunday, it will complete the process of suspending its beer production and marketing operations in compliance with the agreement published on March 31, which establishes extraordinary actions to address the health emergency caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2,” the company said in a statement.The company’s portfolio includes 46 national brands such as Corona, Modelo, Pacífico and Victoria.The Emergencia Sanitaria decree issued by the federal government on March 31 includes the suspension of all non-essential activities until April 30. The essential activities are those related to health, security, justice, civil protection, energy or food provision, including agribusiness.“In the event the federal government considers it appropriate to issue some clarification confirming beer as an agro-industrial product, at Grupo Modelo, we are ready to execute a plan with more than 75 percent of our staff working from home,” added the company.Grupo Modelo has eight plants across Mexico located in Yucatan, Zacatecas, Coahuila, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Oaxaca, Sinaloa and Hidalgo."
"#257. Compromise=deaths. Bottom line. Everyone stay home. Except to go out to save lives or get supplies that maintains life. Nothing else Every time you leave your home there will be increased deaths in the future. Look at the projection charts that brilliant people have developed and sadly demonstrate how even if one person spreads to one other person, it multiplies and many more deaths occur in the future. The more we all stay home the sooner this will end."
"CancunLover,Right on. I know two people who have now died of this and 2 more in the hospital. I can name several I know who have Covid-19. And this is the beginning. I was talking last night with some friends who originally fell in the ""this is overhyped and politicized"" camp. Now they are scared and humbled, feeling behind the 8-ball with their late prep and their late to the game social distancing in spite of recommendations. These are unchartered waters. That anyone was/is engaging in and recommending behaviors different from the best advice of experts is dangerous, selfish, and irresponsible. I hate to think how many unnecessary deaths will have been caused by like-minded horror shows masquerading as humans."
"@Reviewer, I am scared and humbled. Yet I doubt overhyping and politicizing the pandemic will save any lives. Bots and shills don't post in good faith, they post to further their political agenda, be it against Trump, Merkel or AMLO, to them it's just another day at the beach.My point is that today we have a huge pile of dishes to wash and political bickering is always a distraction. When it's all over, we can look back and adjudicate responsibilities but today it's only white noise.Edited: 3:44 pm, April 03, 2020 "
As predicted. The murder rate in Mexico is increasing - https:/…
"Miguel,Well said. Unfortunately, because of or beyond politics, there are still those who think that they know better and can follow and recommend their own (misguided) guidelines, to the danger of all."
"well said, reviewermaryland."
Everything normal but you might have gotten the virus while there and spreading it at airport etc
Taco's are essential. Can anyone recommend a good taco place?
"Rob D, but you can spread the virus going to a taco stand.Don't take my statement as too far out. Sterile hands, mask (except when eating the taco) handle money, sterilize your hands.I know that I sound idiotic, but take what I said with a grain of salt and practice good sanitization and social distancing. Protect yourself and protect us."
"""Unfortunately, because of or beyond politics, there are still those who think that they know better and can follow and recommend their own (misguided) guidelines, to the danger of all.""In due time I will be proven right that this was a politicized media driven hysteria event that did not warrant the flawed ""shut everything down"" approach taken.It will be revealed that modeling used to make estimates was so flawed that it makes fake climate change predictions look reasonable.From the beginning the response should have been risk-based targeting those most likely to be hospitalized or killed by this virus...or the flu.There was no need to cause the level of economic ruin in this area or the USA. Going forward, the risk-based approach is still the best option.I have little faith in the CDC or WHO.Edited: 8:41 pm, April 17, 2020 "
Wow...that is a whole new level of ignorance and self delusion.
"Ignorance, arrogance, and delusion. If only the deniers and minimizers were only putting themselves at risk, the consequences would be far less troubling. It will be disturbing to see what distortions and contortions are employed when he gleefully declares himself “right all along” with a trail of hundreds of thousands of deaths."
We shall see.
"In the US, 700,000 cases and almost 35,000 deaths in 3 months and this with social distancing and lockdowns in place.Hard to see that it is a hysterical media driven event.So easy to blame the media when the facts do not jive with your narrative."
"Co Pilot54I have said on this forum before that Europe and particularly the UK are a few weeks ahead of the USA in terms of the effect of the virus.I would agree that old people and those with underlying health conditions are more at risk.However, in the UK two people I know through family who work at our local hospital are strugglig with the virus. This is repeated throughout the country and some health professionals have died. In London 20 bus drivers have died.The vast majority of health workers and bus drivers had no underlying health condition and overall about 10% of those that have died were perfectly healthy. On post 285 figures that makes 3500 so far who were healthy and are now dead.So, unless you live in isolation on an mountain top you should protect yourself."
#281 maybe do more research. bajainsider.com/article/progress-corona-viru…
#286 -Co_Pilot 54 (Colorado Springs) does live on a pretty high mountain. although he is not isolated. He is in fact correct that much of the modeling considering COVID-19 was and perhaps still is flawed as this is a new problem that we are dealing with and models are constantly being updated. CoPilot is picking a few points that can be deliberated at length and pulling a lot of chains. He has been around for a long time and I think he is getting bored with so little to talk about with the virus taking front page. Don't feed his banter and he will go back to the normal intelligent posts that he normally does.
