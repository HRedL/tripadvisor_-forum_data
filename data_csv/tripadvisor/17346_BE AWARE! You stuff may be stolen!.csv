"Just came back form Gran Bahia. Wanted to warn ppl...you personal thing can be stolen.In the first day toulet in our room didn't flash, I notified front-desk, the told me not to put toulet paper into toulet as it's not allowed in Mexico and promised to send somebody to fix it. In the evening toulet was fixed, but from out room new sandals of my son were stolen todether with beach tower. At the beginning I didn't understand why they stole also towel, but after understood that the thief should've wrap sandals that it won't be suspisious. I spoke about it with front desk , but it was waste of time. Couple of days later my crocks were stolen from Coba beach. I visited hundreds of resorts/hotels include Cuba, Bahamas, Turkey, Israel and so on. NEVER I didn't get my stuff stolen.Maybe this is style of life in Mexico?!"
"I had a bike stolen here in Toronto, but have never had anything stolen while on vacation. Unfortunately theft can happen anywhere. For the one person that it happens to at a resort another 1000 can go to the same resort and nothing is stolen.The Bahia has a good reputation, other than this unfortunate incident how was your stay at the Bahia?"
"This appears to be reaching epidemic proportions. I remember a series of posts last fall about mysterious disappearances from a room, cigarette butts on the balcony and cats wearing stolen Tevas."
"Hi Therecant comment on the items stolen from your room that was just unfortunate, but the crocs taken from the beach was most likely a random tourist and not a member off staff reading all the reviews this hotel has a very good reputation. I Can also stress its not just mexico sandles taken fron hotel lobby salousunglasses pool side rhodescamera oops i left it in a taxi in fuertaventura but couldnt get it back. never let it ruin my holidays I am a trusting person but rubbish happens its all over the world....... "
Gibot:So sorry to here about you stolen shoes. 
"I don't think that crocks were taken by some tourist by mistake, it happened late in the day when there were no tourists close to my place...And sandals for sure were stolen by staff member.If somebody think that it's not truth...I don't care... just wanted to warn potential travelers.As regarding my general opinion about Gran Bahia, I'll publish report later. In couple of words I can say that resorts is OK , but nothing special. Last 3 years in a row we visited Cuba )Cayo Coco, Cayo Guilermo and Holguin) and we liked Cuba much better. Food, entertainment, people much better in Cuba. Beach at Bahia - disaster, cannot even be compared with Cuba's.The only thing that we liked better at Bahia - swimming pools (especially at Akumal)"
"I remember that Terry, the Bahia conspiracy theory.Safes being broken into not once but twice. Anyway I digress. "
"skier - the point is that your thing may be stolen from your room...it doesn't matter shoes or some different stuff.But for sure, I'm not going to this resort anymore ... next year - back to Cuba"
"Regarding stuff stolen off the beach, that could happen anytime, anywhere, considering the number of people on a beach at a hotel of that size. Regarding your shoes stolen from the room, did you report that to management? What did they say about it?"
"Gibot:All I said was that I was sorry about your stolen shoes. Everyone that responded said they are sorry and no one said they did not believe you. Every one that has responded so far has said that theft happens everywhere.Again, I'm sorry that your shoes were stolen or that a theft happened to you. We all believe you, theft happens everywhere.We look forward to your review and thank you for the warning."
"""Every one that has responded so far has said that theft happens everywhere.""Probably, as i said I visited hundreds of places and such thing happened only in Gran Bahia.When I told about it at front desk , they called housekeeping I asked them if they took the sandals from the room... You can guess what was the answer... than they send me to Public Relation and I didn't like how they talked to me... at the end they tolad me that I can fill out report and than security will go to my room with me and perform search.... and that after security will investigate... I didn't want all this mess, as I understood from behaviour of public relation girl that it will be only waste of time. Obviously, that guy who fixed toulet stole it... because it happened between 7 and 9 pm when we were dining."
Leaves a sour taste in your mouth when something like this happens doesn't it?Thanks for letting people know.
"I think if something is stolen from your room you do have a responsibility to fill out the form etc so the hotel has a paper trail of complaints to look into. If no one fills anything out, then it is almost like it didn't happen - it certainly won't be investigated. I am not saying it didn't happen, but I find it hard to believe that the Bahia guest services manager offered you little help, this is a chain that prides itself on good customer service. I had a client last week have $300 stolen from her locked safe at a RiU in Punta Cana. Clearly an inside job, but they did fill out a report so it could be investigated and the hotel upgraded them over to a different hotel. If nothing else management was made aware of the problem.I know when you are on vacation it is a pain to get tied up with stuff like this, but it does happen everywhere and thankfully you have been lucky to this point to avoid it on your many travels. Our experience with the Bahia staff was that they were overly cautious to make sure they were above suspicion - my boys simply trying to give a new ballcap to the gardeners was troublesome because they didn't know whether to accept the gifts or not.Go easy, this isn't necessarily a Bahia problem, but perhaps one unfortunate incident that they could have looked into if given the opportunity."
I had a magazine I had not finished with and a chunk of Easter Egg removed prematurely. This was stuff that could not technically have been stolen rather 'cleared away'. It was weird to find them gone though. Nowhere near the bin.
hey that happened in my own house - only the tattered half eaten ears left as a sign that the bunny was even there. devious theives - maybe they were trying to point out my hypocricy of reading Shape magazine while eating easter candy. 
"""Leaves a sour taste in your mouth when something like this happens doesn't it?""Exactly! and this is my point!"
"These things can happen all over the world from 2 star to 5 star resorts its a shame but they can and will happen any where so no reflextion on the hotel other than the way they deal with complaints perhaps,"
"Giblet,Sorry you had your stuff stolen.But I must say that with you having been to ""hundreds of places"", you are extrordinarily lucky that this is your first ( and very minor )experience with theft.As for the ""sour taste in your mouth"", I can only refer you to the thread about tequila preferences."
It certainly can happen anywhere. my family was gassed and robbed in spain last summer.
"Alterry, you really do crack me up. I am still laughing about ""brock umbellera"". I think you can give Skier a run at ""cracking me up""."
" Every visit to Mexico in the last three years, more than one person has offered to trade us something for our sandals. One guy eyed ours so much last time, I made it a point to not leave them on the patio at night.One of the last things I ever thought to worry about.Sad to get ripped off when on vacation."
"""you are extrordinarily lucky that this is your first ( and very minor )experience with theft.""Maybe you so unlucky if you get stuff stolen from your hotel room numerious times?!"
"GibotSorry to hear about your stuff.""Maybe this is style of life in Mexico?!""Mexico is a country, how much of it did you see? While experiencing the ""country"" what else was stolen? On one trip you had a bathroom that did not work, plus your sandals, beach towel and crocks were stoles. My grandmother used to say, child be careful with your things because if it wasn't for bad luck, you would have no luck at all. "

"Giblet,I'm afraid I didn't understand your rejoinder to my comment about you being lucky.But I'm sure it was moderate and not given to stereotyping,overstatement or hyperbole."
"What the Gran Bahia MUST understand, is that Gibot will go home and tell everyone they know about the theft. These people will go out and tell people. They will go out and tell people.Pretty soon someone will say ""Oh yeah, I heard something bad about that place. Don't remember what I heard but it was bad! I think it was the staff are all thieves!"" Not a true statement, but people will remember the worse.In all the years I have been going to Akumal / Tulum I have never had a case to report this type of experience. (My good fortune)Gibot, I feel your pain and thanks for the warning about this resort."
"rhodesazHe will take it one step further. Why stop at a mere resort. He is going after the entire country. Before long no one would who treasure their sandals and crocks should go to Mexico. As he said, ""Maybe this is style of life in Mexico?!"" Before this warning, I was so looking forward to this vacation. It's settled, I will leave the sandals and crocks home where they will be safe. Safe at last, safe at last, thank God almighty they are safe at last!BTW...what are crocks? "
"Hey Kooljammin,Crocks are very comfy (but butt ugly )molded plastic sandals.BTW, I found your ""safe at last, safe at last"" riff hilarious! Never thought I would allude to OJ and MLK in the same paragraph."
"Crocs (not Crocks) are a very comfortable shoe/sandal made of a bacteria-resistent resin in Niwot, Colorado. Well, the company is out of Niwot - no telling where the shoes are actually made. Very hip - in an unhip sort of way. A friend's daughter works in marketing for the company (Crocs - not Crocks). Have been to hundreds of places (if you count Milner and Rush, Colorado among those places). Have had a few things stolen (probably lost after too many cocktails), but would never consider that a reflection on the people or place itself. More like misfortune or a mistake (or too many cocktails). For the large part, people I have encountered in the U.S., Mexico, Europe, Asia, New Zealand, etc. are good, kind people just trying to live a good life with their families and friends."
"alterryOnly on TA could some manage to put OJ and MLK even in the same train of thought. Then again only here someone has the audacity to relate a theft of a B-U-T-T ugly (though comfortable) pair of sandals to the life style of the people. When since an A/I stay reflects anything about the country? Gibot....Next time take a minute to experience the real Mexican life style. You will be surprise to leave with some thing much more valuable than a towel, sandals or crocs! BTW..still sorry that you loose them. They obviously meant a lot to you!JMOP"
"Hey Kooljammin,I doubt that we differ very much. Well spoke."
I have impression that some people on TA are shareholders of Gran Bahia lol
Gibot:That was funny!!!
"Crocs are ugly is most sense ive heard all day Flip flops are going in the safe at night and never leaving my feet during the day,"
"Hey Gibot,I don't think you can be complacent anywhere. You always got to be on guard. Just before I left for Mexico I had my prescription sunglasses 'taken' from the Hilton hotel in Manchester. Nobody knows by whom and just what use they would have been to anyone else I have no idea but if it aint screwed down keep an eye on it.Don't let a little thing like this cloud your impression of Mexico. Just think, their need must be greater than yours lolIt can happen anywhere at any time mate...sadlyKath"
"Sad to say, it can happen anywhere. For example we left our garage door open last night...Little rats left all the expensive stuff (including the cars with the keys on the seat) and stole all the Bud Lite and Girl Scout cookies I had stashed in the outside fridge. Not happy about losing those Girl Scout cookies......"
"We left our safe open one of the days there, when we returned there was anote telling us how to use the safe...ZI guess they must want crocs and filp flops more than money and credit cards.."
"""...and stole all the Bud Lite and Girl Scout cookies I had stashed in the outside fridge. Not happy about losing those Girl Scout cookies"" good thing it was just bud light- were it real beer, I would have been livid(LOL)"
"Gibot,Generalizing about countries and theft based on your experience at a couple of resorts in a couple of resort places is not really wise. I just returned from Cuba. We had a bungalow very near the beach at the resort we stayed at. We know better than to leave things out front on the porch - but at one point left my son's swim shirt out front hanging on a chair, and a fellow with his two kids came by and grabbed the shirt and also an ashtray off the table. My husband saw him and ran out and grabbed the shirt back (but he let him keep the ashtray). So these things happen in Cuba too. In fact, they happen anywhere that people with very little are tempted by those of us with plenty who are careless enough to leave our stuff lying around. They are probably basically honest people, they just don't have a whole lot of stuff. So if you value something, the obligation lies with you to keep tabs on your it. Hopefully you haven't let the loss of some used shoes and a towel ruin your On a humorous note, also on this last trip to Cuba, I left my flip flops out overnight, and in the morning only one was there. Was is a one legged thief who likes the beach?? Or was it my little four legged friend who liked to bury things around the resort? We'll never know, but I suspect the latter! And I blame myself, for being dumb enough to leave them out. But good heavens, they are just shoes."
"In 2006 we all went over to Cuba for my sisters wedding and on the very last day, my sister had $300 taken from inside her locked safe.So Gibot, theft can happen anywhere, Even in Cuba (wow, the shock!!)"
"I feel this subject has run its course. Anyone who has travelled to many places around the world knows that some of the more affluent society countries have the worst reputation for thieves. Anyone been to Naples in Italy? any of the Costa's in Spain? for us Europeans they are terrible places for thieves. We have been to Thailand many times, and Bali, they are some of the poorest people in holiday locations, but we have never had problems with thieving, and their needs are greater than most.I feel sure that the majority of Mexican people are hard working and honest, and that they appreciate very much the small tips that we give them for thier services.Looking forward to visiting GBP on Sunday for two weeks. "
We were robbed at Anfield last sunday. 
Cruiser's right. See you there.
"Gibot,It is not right that your shoes were stolen; however, perhaps to make you feel better about it, consider that the shoes were taken by someone who really needed them. Perhaps they werer taken by a local who has a child with no shoes or tattered shoes. Consider that they were taken because they were really needed. That would make me feel better about the theft."
"We also returned (reluctantly) from the Gran Bahia Principe Tulum. The first afternoon there I absent mindedly left my Prada sunglasses in the Tulum bar/lounge. I did not realize I had forgotten them till the next day. We went to the front desk and the bar and they did not have them. The staff however, were accommodating and courteous. The following day I asked at Public Relations if there was any other place they may have been turned in. The woman there said, No, but we could fill out a form reporting the loss and describing the glasses. The form was filled out and I was called the next day to say Security had found my sunglasses. I felt like the resort went out of their way for me. Anybody could have taken the glasses. This was indicative of our entire stay. Everyone was very pleasant, kind and helpful. We had a fabulous time!!!PSI bought a pair of ten dollar sunglasses from the gift shop and wore them the rest of the trip!! I actually liked them better than the Pradas! :) "
I never take my expensive anything on my trips. If I have to worry about it it does not belong with me on my vacation!:)

"DDFCall me stupid, but why did you bump it after the last post, almost 12 hours ago? On a public forum who decide when nuff said? Just curious!"
"Yeah, maybe this should stay on the front page to remind us all how shallow some travelers are. Some goes on vacation, looses something and has the audacity to judge an entire nation by it.""Maybe this is style of life in Mexico?!"""
some = someone
"the main thing that needs to be addressed in this post is that the""toulet didnt flash "" what the heck is a toulet? i know what a toilet is but not a toulet. i didnt have a toulet in my room in mexico.....i bet someone took it when i wasnt looking."
HAHA wicked...that's funny!
