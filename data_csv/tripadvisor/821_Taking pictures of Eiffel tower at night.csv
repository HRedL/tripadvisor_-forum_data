We are gonna visit Paris in mid August and this is our first time. We also booked our Eiffel tower tickets at 10 PM and as usual we want to click romantic couple photos Infront of Eiffel tower but I just got to know that it is illegal to click photos of Eiffel tower at night. What to do??Help me.
What do you realistically think will happen if you take a photo of the Eiffel Tower at night?Arrested along with all the other thousands of tourists doing exactly the same thing?As long as you aren't going to use the photo for commercial purposes you will be fine.
Private photos of the Eiffel Tower are totally authorized. Commercial photos are subject to official authorization and payment because the twinkling lights are copyrighted. It costs a fortune to show them in a movie.
LOL. I am imagining a raid at Trocadero scooping up a couple of hundred tourists photographing the Tower at night. FWIW still photos of the twinkling tower are kind of a bust; you have to video to get the effect. The thing actually looks better during the non twinkling phase in night photos. Don't give it a thought.I think it is ridiculous that a monument like that can 'copyright' itself but as K2 notes it costs a fortune to show it in films which is why low budget films don't show it twinkling.
Wanna know something even more ridiculous? All of the volcanoes in Auvergne are privately owned and commercial photographers have to pay to take a picture of them. Volvic knows a bundle about that.
"For romantic couple photos w/ Eiffel Tower, get to Trocadero early in the morning (7-8 am), not at night."
Thanks all of you for replying!! But I was really tensed about that and I don't wanna ruin my honeymoon by any means. So I thought it's better to ask people.
"All those articles you come across online saying it's illegal are just click bait, plain and simple. Someone making outrageous claims in a headline to grab attention and garner clicks. It's usually hidden somewhere in the article (or not explained very well) that the copyright laws only apply to commercial photography, as has been explained here."
"As you can see, it won't be a problem at all ... even though it's technically illegal to take photos of the ET day or night. 10 out of 10 of us have taken a photo(s) of the Eiffel Towel lit at night and enjoy these beautiful photos to this day."
"#8 is incorrect. It is not illegal to take photos of the Eiffel Tower, day or night. It is illegal to commercially distribute photos of the light show on the Eiffel Tower, as the light show itself is copyrighted. Take as many photos for personal use as you want. You'll be fine."
"Per post #9, wrong-o! https://www.travelandleisure.com/photography…"
"Actually, it's funny that the author of the Travel & Leisure article linked in #9, didn't seem to read the source they linked in the article (or they didn't summarize it very well).If you go to the full Snopes article that was linked, it explains that the copyright claim has nothing to do with simply taking nighttime photos of the light show, the claim made is: ------------------------------“The views from the Eiffel Tower are rights-free. Permission and rights must be obtained from the “Société d’Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel” (the operating company, or SETE) for the publication of photographs of the illuminated Eiffel Tower.”------------------------------The key word is *publication*, so you are free to take any photo you would like, as long as you don't publish it. The article does point out that the EU considers publication to include posting online (social media/photo sites/etc.), even for private individuals. However, it also points out that making a claim of a copyright is not the same as actually having or enforcing that claim. The validity of the copyright has actually never been tested in any court.But even if we assume that the claim would hold up, you are still free to take picture for your own private use.Here's the full article: https:/…Edited: 1 year ago "
"#10--reread the article you linked to. As most of us have said, it is only (technically) illegal to *distribute* or to *publish without permission* those nighttime light show photos. You can legally take all the photos you wish, day or night, for your own personal enjoyment."
"The article is simply wrong. You find that information everywhere and its bull. You can not commersial distribute but apart from that, no restrictions.Edited: 2:58 am, May 19, 2020 "
"Isn't it the case that any copyright issue is only likely to arise in relation to the light display itself? The display is a creative artefact and so not able to be captured and applied for some other commercial purpose. Ownership cannot be appropriated through the use of a created work even, I imagine, if it were a light show. Perhaps as a still photograph does not represent the continuous nature of the display, the essence of the created work, there would be no breach of copyright in the display.It would be unusual - but maybe not under French law - for a building over a hundred years old to be somehow protected under copyright from being photographed, or painted or simulated - we have a mini Eiffel Tower in our city, and aren't there similar in Disney-type parks elsewhere? I wonder who would sign the release form (the Mayor of paris?), as media producers can be required to do when specific people are photographed and featured in advertisements or documentaries.However, any subsequent photo or painting of the Eiffel Tower, or any other public icon for that matter, would itself be a copyright protected property in the interest of the artist who created the image. A video of the Eiffel Tower light display, if published or otherwise distributed, might be a breach of the creator's copyright - but it might be counterproductive to go after a tourist who put it on their website. However, if someone made a movie - let's call it Midnight in Paris - and featured the light display, there might be a conversation to be had with whichever authority owned the copyright of the display itself. But maybe the rights to the display were bought by the commissioners of the work, under the terms of the contract for its creation.....and on and and on.Copyright law is a labrynth.Act in good faith - ask for forgiveness if you should have asked for permission, is what I would do ;-)PS: Some chocolatiers and patissieres might not like you taking shots of their creative work - just to throw another log on the fire :-oEdited: 1:51 am, May 20, 2020 "
"I don't remember if there were shots of the Eiffel Tower in this film : https:/…Midnight_in_ParisEdited: 2:02 am, May 20, 2020 "
"""Some chocolatiers and patissieres might not like you taking shots of their creative work"".Why masculine chocolatiers, but feminine pâtissières? I would have written pâtissiers which would include women."
The French are very protective of their gender determinations ... as the Germans are of their three. CheersAnthony K
"""The French are very protective of their gender determinations ... ""For some obscure reason it has been officially decided that Covid 19 is feminine. I don't know why since un virus is masculine. A French friend was quite annoyed about that when he discovered it yesterday."
"Sorry Tradeform about the masculine and feminine gender terminology oversight - nice shot though. But I was just using my pidgin-French...no offence intended. On the further hand though, far be it from me to pursue you down the broader genderist issues raised by your sally ;-)As for ""Midnight in Paris"" - I was kind of hoping that it might be taken somewhat apocryphally. You are in good form, mate!Edited: 4:37 am, May 20, 2020 "
"Sorry I get a bit pedantic sometimes, but no offence is intended for anyone, especially not for GoingRoundAgain, who is one of the more level-headed and useful contributors on these forums."
"""Sorry I get a bit pedantic sometimes"" — only sometimes? Here's my turn to be pedantic: As was explained in the Académie française's pronouncement, COVID-19 is an acronym for coronavirus disease 2019, which in French would be rendered as la maladie à coronavirus 2019. Since the head of the phrase is feminine, so goes the acronym. The logic's there, even if the choice of method used to reach the final result is flawed. But no one is under any obligation to pay any attention whatsoever to what the self-important immortals of the Académie française deem ""proper French."" Le COVID-19 is by far what is most commonly used in France; la COVID-19 barely registers. The immortals can stick their heads in the sand, but le COVID-19 – both the disease and the masculine gender – is here to stay. For an interesting read on the topic: https://theconversation.com/le-la-covid-reou…"
"Apparently, the masculine and feminine gender of words in France exceeds the intellect of many people. But of course this includes the French because most of the French still consider ""covid"" to be a masculine gender word instead of feminine. Not to worry, though. Everybody puts up with it. There are not all that many words where getting the gender wrong will get you in trouble -- but wow, those words can really mess you up if you get them wrong."
How will the French deal with the gender neutral agenda that is being pushed in many quarters? Le and la with a neutral version 'li'?
"I am unfamiliar with 'li' as a gender-neutral alternative to le and la. I am, however, familiar with iel as a gender-neutral alternative to il and elle. I am also familiar with the convention of writing things with a median point, like: les musicien·ne·s. Native speakers of languages that don't have grammatical gender are often flummoxed when learning a language that does. 'But WHY is the apple FEMALE?"" Well, it's not. It's feminine. That doesn't mean that there's anything inherently biologically feminine about an apple. It just means that it belongs to the noun class called feminine. Many linguists (myself included) are moving away from the term 'gender' to refer to what are better described as noun classes. As for gender-neutral personal pronouns, the French language will adapt to these just as English, Swedish, German and many other languages are doing. The sky isn't falling, despite what pearl-clutchers at the Académie française might think. There is a wide body of scientific, academic literature - both in English and in French - about this. But I fear we are moving off-topic, and I recognise and apologise for my role in facilitating that. As I've written, I am a professional linguist, so could talk about language all day. Happy to carry on the conversation and share my credentials over direct message, if that interests you.Edited: 3:08 pm, May 20, 2020 "
The reason you are unfamiliar with it is because I just made it up :)Many linguists (myself included) are moving away from the term 'gender' to refer to what are better described as noun classes....sounds like you are moving to the linguistic equivalent of object orientation in computer programming. I admire the French for sticking with their traditions and resisting these calls for everything be gender neutral - people with nothing better to do other than stirring up nonsense. I note that connerie is feminine.
"""The reason you are unfamiliar with it is because I just made it up"" -- ah, well that explains that, then :-)""sounds like you are moving to the linguistic equivalent of object orientation in computer programming"" -- yes, something like that, although the similarities break down the more you think about them. ""people with nothing better to do other than stirring up nonsense"" -- strong disagree from me for a variety of reasons, but I'll leave it at that. We're already far away from the topic of taking pictures of the Eiffel Tower at night. Happy to talk about language and linguistics elsewhere, though."
Even if this discussion has been side-tracked (mea culpa) at least it's good to see an exchange without contributors insulting each other.
I think if we have to tolerate endless Disneyland Paris posts using irritating acronyms we can occasionally venture into language-related issues.
OffalyRover15You're missing a joy. Reading Disneyland Paris posts and inventing your own meanings for the acronyms is what got me through lockdown. The idea is to make the posts as salacious or blasphemous as possible.I now have a mental image of a theme park full of the worst kind of people :)
"There has been a push in France for ""inclusive"" spelling, which is a total abomination.When written down it looks like this: « technicien.ne », « arrivé.e.s » or « italien-ne-s », « employé-e ».I defy anybody to know how this should be read out loud."
"Kerouac, in all aspects of life here in Ireland (social, professional, terminology etc) we have a huge push for this gender neutral nonsense. This has happened shortly after the proliferation of text speak "" I no wat u did lst nite'. Leave languages as they are and don't spoil them with this nonsense. There are clowns hanging around waiting to be offended and language is one of the topics in their cross hairs. They should really get a life and worry about more important things like such as how the planet is being destroyed by modern living."
"The only languages which don't change are dead ones. – David CrystalFor what it's worth, «autrice» and «philosophesse» were in use before the 17th century, when (male) language commentators removed them from the dictionaries for supposed improprieties. And of course, the supposed precedence of the masculine form of professional titles over the feminine has led to some fairly egregious examples of gender discrimination: - women were barred from taking the lawyer's oath at the end of the 18th century when the Assemblée argued that an 1810 law excluded women from the profession on the basis that the law used the term «avocat», in the masculine.- and in 1935, the Conseil d'État refused women the right to vote, giving the following explanation: «Le législateur, en donnant le droit de vote ""à tous les Français"" n'avait pas pensé aux femmes.»So the Académie francaise's argument that the masculine form is a generic, gender-neutral form that applies to both sexes has not panned out historically. As for using the medial points, I do use them when writing in a formal, professional capacity, but I don't bother with them in text messages, informal emails or other types of writing. It's a stylistic choice that signals certain intentions to the reader, but it is in no way corruptive of the language itself. (Because language can't be corrupted.)And it appears that AFNOR's 2018 keyboard design puts the medial point in a place of prominence, so I reckon it will stick around for a while, regardless of the objections of the immortel·le·s. https:/…"
"While the French language continues to defend the word ""actrice"" as opposed to ""acteur,"" many English speakers seem to think that actresses should be called actors. In that case, there should be only one category at the Oscars with no distinction between the sexes.I would still like to know how you read inclusive spelling out loud.Edited: 12:49 pm, May 21, 2020 "
I don't. I merely read it in silently. I have some friends who use inclusive spelling as a matter of course. I'll check in with them to see what they do.
"The general consensus seems to be that the written convention is merely that: written. It is not something that is meant to be spoken. Were they to come across, for example, « les musicien·ne·s sont... » and need to read it out loud for some reason, they would say « les musiciens et les musiciennes sont... »I'm only the messenger."
