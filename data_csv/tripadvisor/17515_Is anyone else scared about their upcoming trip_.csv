I'm a little nervous with our news reports saying that H1N1 will peak in about 6 to 8 weeks in Minnesota. My trip is in a little more than 6 weeks and I will be mad as heck if I get the flu and have to cancel. I normally don't get sick when everyone else does but I'm sure I will this time just because I have been waiting so long to make it back to Vegas. Looks like I won't be touching anyone until I at least land in Vegas!!
"You could always purchase travel insurance if you are worried about having to cancel your trip. In any case, try to think positively.By the way, nobody knows when the H1N1 flu might peak in Minnesota or anywhere else. So whatever news report said that is full of BS. The best way to avoid getting the H1N1 flu is to wash your hands thoroughly and often with soap and water, especially before eating or touching your face.H1N1 flu vaccines will also become available in the fall but I have no idea how they will be distributed in your state. "
"Nope, not scared. Just use common sense (and a lot of soap) and you'll be fine. :)"
I will be out there in Vegas also around the same time frame.Just make sure you wash your hands. I'm also packing some sanitizing gel.
"I'm scared because I might trip down the steps tonight and break my leg and have to cancel. Or I might get into a car wreck on the way to the airport. Food poisoning the day I leave for the trip. Family member might get deathly ill before I leave. Coyotes could come into my house and eat my luggage. I might get the flu. Or cancer. Or appendicitis. Vertigo or amnesia! Heart attack.Other than that, I'm not scared at all."
"Second what stratton said; wash your hands often, try to be aware of touching your face (most people do it much more often than they realize). Try to minimize use of telephones that have been used by others. "
"I'd be more scared of losing all my money in Vegas. Remember SARS and the predicted worldwide bird flu epidemic? Didn't think so. Two years from now, you won't remember swine flu either."
"you cant spend time worrying about things you have no control over.I work with the public and they come in all the time sniffing-coughing.Im not worried about that at all.My major concern is the blow dryer in the room.Im trying to do this trip with just a carry on,,, so I dont think you can bring a blow dryer on the plane. "
You can bring a blow dryer on a plane. 
Yes.. we should all PANIC!!! AAAAAAHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhOk... no not even a little
"You can take your blow dryer on the plane, but you shouldn't need it. Almost all Las Vegas hotels have hair dryers in every room. If yours doesn't, call the front desk and request one.As for getting sick, visualizing yourself getting sick is a sure way of getting sick (I see it here at work all the time!) Rather, visualize yourself NOT getting sick, take a good multi-vitamin to keep your immune system strong, wash your hands a lot, and try not to hang out with the sniffling/sneezing/wheezing people. "
HaHa Dave! No need to be scarred of losing my money since that is a given anyway!
"Nope, we went to Mexico this summer when everyone thought we were crazy. Not even a sniffle. The only concession I am making is I will have a small instant gel sanitizer in my fanny pack to use when I touch the slots."
"Oh I really wouldn't worry about it.Here in the UK you couldn't turn on the TV two months ago without being told how we were going to be struck down at the rate of 100,000 per week or something equally ridiculous.The National Health Service spent millions setting up Swine Flu help centres to cope with the number of people who were going to be affected.What are all those help centre staff doing now? They are sitting around playing cards all day because the pandemic didn't amount to much."
"I could be wrong about this, but I seem to remember reading that with all the recorded cases of H1/N1 in North America, that the ratio of deaths per number of cases is lower than for the ""regular"" flu, so I am not sure what all the panic is about. "
"Wow - I'm leaving from MN 6 weeks from tomorrow ~ maybe we'll be on the same plane! ;-)I am more worried that one of my kids will get it while I'm gone. I went to Korea in the hieght of the Avian Flu, just as they had killed off all of their chickens, spent 1 week there and after a total of 48 hours of air travel never got sick. I was downing Emergen-C like crazy tho! "
Your odds from dying as a pedestrian during your lifetime are 1 in 627. Your odds of dying as an occupant in a car crash during your lifetime are 1 in 261.You have a better chance this year of dying from getting struck by lightening or falling off a building then dying from swine flu.Sorry but I dont know the odds of contracting swine flu. But I'm guessing its something you really dont need to worry about.
"There is no reason to be ""scared"". The only reason H1N1 was worrisome earlier in the year is the possibility that it was more virulent (deadly) due to fatalities in the younger population in Mexico.This has not proved to be the case. If you contract H1N1 you will feel like you have the flu, no better, no worse. It will be widespread because most people do not have as much immunity built up to H1N1 because it doesn't occur every year like regular flu A and flu B.Get your regular flu shot and then the H1N1 when it becomes available. Use good hygiene and common sense precautions.My job necessitates that I conference call with the TDH every other day. If different info becomes available I will post it. But you can get the same info on your state's Dept. of Health web site or the CDC web site. "
"Relax, it's just irresponsible scaremongering by the press. Happens every year - bird flu, swine flu. What next doggy flu?  I'm having the flu jab next month because I didn't have it last year and caught normal flu - no way am I risking missing Vegas so having a jab instead.  If you're really concerned, just take echinacea to build up your immune system so you won't get it. And then start planning how much fun you're going to have! "
"No, I am not scared. What would be the point. So many things can happen to me -in the next day, week, month. I refuse to live my life in a panic over something that may or may not happen before, during or after the trip. I have a life to live-one that I want to enjoy. I will use common sense and what is going to happen is going to happen. "
"Sorry Quaffed: but echinecea, pfffttttt, lol!"
"When the Nile flu came along, I thought I had caught it. Seezing, coughing, high fever, halucinating-why I kept seeing Cleopatra's asp."
"I going to Vegas next month and I hope I get over whatever I got right now. Again, bad symptoms-fever, achiness, I wake up skealing for no reason, I have this craving for slop in the dog's bowl and just the other morning, the wife found me wallowing in the back yard. Think it might be the swine flu?"
"It happened to me this weekend. I do all the right things and still spent the last 30 hrs of my trip shivvering, sweating and sick to death under my blanket in my room at TI. So bad things happen|||||."
I think you're just excited about your upcoming trip but don't have a tail to wag........Maybe if ya be sweet to your wife she'll scratch your back with a stick!
"^^^^^^^^^to Hitch, not Cougar"
"LOL,,, or you might win some money!!!!!! :)"
"Don't trouble yourself. I repeat, don't trouble yourself."
"The gambling starts when you board the plane.Dont sweat it. Have fun. If you get sick you get sick, if not then even better. Either way have fun!!"
