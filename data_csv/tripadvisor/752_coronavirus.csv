Does anyone know if the coronavirus has been identified in Roatan? A lot of visitors are from Europe. Are they allowed in?
2 reported cases in Honduras so far. Both on the mainland.
My information suggests that it will be at its very worst the last week in May when I will be there. I would definitely avoid going that week.
"Thanks, we're going middle of June to sign the paper work on our new villa. Should be done by then.I thought the virus didn't like the hot weather?"
"The virus doesn't like soap and fresh air. Wash your hands often and feel free to take a walk. Open windows if you're in a stuffy room with lots of people.Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan are ""hot"" countries, but they found the virus there, although all 3 places have not seen new patients for weeks and have it pretty much ""contained."" Heat will not deter the virus from spreading. https:/…myth-busters"
"Covid-19 is in Mexico, Florida, Australia etc. and some Caribbean islands.... all warm/hot places. Are people actually being tested in Roatan?"
"Someone posted in a facebook group I belong to, that the Honduran government posted an official statement that basically says: 1. Government calls the population to abstain from unnecessary travel. 2. Any citizen arriving to Honduras from China, Iran, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, among others, should provide info from countries they´ve visited recently and subject themselves to a health inspection and protocol or will not be admitted. 3. From yesterday on there´s a restriction from persons arriving through air, sea and land if they´re citizens of countries with high incidences of the virus, consisting of self isolation for 14 days to confirm they´re not carrying the virus.Has anyone else heard this? They posted the notification in Spanish and I know enough Spanish to confirm their translation. We are coming from the U.S. so I guess we should be prepared for the possibility of a health inspection."
"Consider this long term perspective of how I have seen the “mainland Honduran govt” and the local Island Tourist “front” as presented for our...entertainment.The US pays for and thus gives the Honduran govt a template for many things, not the least of which is all the Passport Control goofiness that we see endlessly revisited here, endlessly. It’s like a game of telephone... we gave them HLS money and what we wanted to make us feel good and keep them employed. This is the point. Then they took our specifications, translated them into Spanish, went to unch and then shipped it all over to Roatan, complete with the fingerprint scanners that came from somebody’s cousin in New Jersey. It’s all a circus for the amusement of the USTaxpayer. You think C19 test kits are sitting at the Roatan FedEx/Kinkos ready to be picked up?The H Govt by its inception and heritage lives for onerous layers of institutionalized bureaucracy. Simply look at the Spanish legal system from where it came. We bemoan what strife befalls the tourist who falls into the flypaper of the seeming jabberwocky of the Spanish legal system. You ain’t in Kansas anymore, plain and simple. I have seen it, many times, up close and personal, this is why (much to the derision of exerts here) I counsel against even driving a car. Avoid their system, you will not understand it or like it.Whatever circus show they will put on will be too little and too late...if you believe in the philosophy of “social distancing”. Nobody here on TA has even begun to fret over protocol for rental regulator mouthpieces or communal dive mask buckets. There is an established fix, but I’m not seeing it happen at the day-dive-ops ...so far and yet. And I have looked. Of course, the dive boat that rolled over last week didn’t either- nor did the small plane crash on takeoff late last year) This is not going to be instituted on Roatan for a lot of reasons, most of high are green and state in God We Trust. Nobody at the decision level of the H Govt is going o be in any hurry to cut off the big cash spigot that is Roatan.The cruise ship stoppage will be noticed first. It affects the immediate cash-flow pipeline directly from the Ship to Tegucigalpa. It will also affect the big-money players on the Island itself. The effect on local dive ops and donut vendors are not going to be what ‘they” are thinking about.In short, do not expect or anticipate any real effective Govt response in the Bay Islands, US Money, if it comes at all, will trickle down like molasses in January. You’re on your own. You might be worried/amused/reassured by Immigration type screening. Seriously? Consider the primitive levels of sanitation by Island food workers. There is not one establishment that could pass the Health Dept inspection in the US. Not one. Washing hands? Be serious. Wash hands or wash produce with purified water? Nope.Worry about the big stuff. Maybe we’ll have a different question from the folks back home...”Aren’t you afraid of the Sharks?”. The pricey US Govt System, the free Canadian Health Care system, none of that is really going to ”prevent” what you’re concerned with. If you have any perception of the Lack of operational capacity of the Honduran Government, you won’t be doubting this.Life is an adventure, fortune rewards the brave."
"My wife is a Japanese Citizen but Canadian landed immigrant. And has not been to Japan since last year. We are supposed to travel to Roatan on Monday for March break. The post above said citizens from Japan will be ""required"" to self Quarantine. This would obviously be a problem. does anyone know where we can find out information about this (source) to confirm!"
"I got the information about specific countries being quarantined from a post on a Roatan Facebook page. They supplied a picture of the official document From the government. I'm not quite sure how to post that on this forum.Edited: 2:33 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Perhaps it is possible to private message it to someone?
"I found it. I will see if I can post the link. Japan is not on the list but Europe, China, Iran and South Korea are banned from entry. Other travelers from foreign countries that have cases of Covid 19 may be subject to minstry of health conditions and requirements (e.g. self isolation)https:/…1"
"Implementation process is the big obstacle in Honduras, but this is what they’re doing so far...“ Honduras, with two coronavirus cases, said it would close schools and cancel public events for two weeks, as well as restrict entry of people coming from Europe, China, Iran and South Korea.”That’s the totality of what I could find."
"Vicious, does you wife still have a Japanese passport? Can she prove her Canadian residence? Does she have an entry/exit stamp in her passport for Japan? (They give you a choice these days, so she might not have one.) There are lots of ways to prove that she hasn't been there for awhile. ""Protocol"" and ""health inspection"" on Roatan shouldn't be hard. If she's flying in from Canada or the US, they might not even notice. Or maybe they're noticing now. Either way, have some sort of proof that she lives in Canada."
"I agree with Caronaandlime, stay away the last week of May! LOL."
I am wondering the same thing. I am planning a trip there in mid June and I can't seem to find any negative information as of yet.
"I do not know. We are planning to go March 20-28. We will cancel if it looks like it would be an issue. We are traveling from US. We are hoping we can make this trip to be outside and stay as a family, and away from most crowds, but also want to be able to get there and back home.We will finalize our decision 48 hours prior to departure, but hoping we can go. Need to escape the hysteria that we are under. We've all been home for a week, thus basically quarantined by the date of our travel."
"Vucious,I saw your link and the one I looked at looks very similar to the one shown on the link, but mine clearly says Japón and it is dated 3/11 not 3/12. I am not great with technology or translation, but will try to see if I can message it to you or post it somehow."
Finally figured out a way to get to the document:https://covid19honduras.org/…The Honduran government has a website dedicated to the virus where the document above and others can be found (look under communicados):https://covid19honduras.org/
"Please keep us posted posted on your travel Michelle S. We are scheduled to go in April. Fingers crossed all works out.Edited: 8:55 am, March 14, 2020 "
"If you would just wear SCUBA gear, this would be a non issue. Use the available technology. B.Y.O.T.P."
We are on the same schedule as your family and thinking similar on waiting to decide until about 48 hours to go. Will be following TA for updates and share any news we hear.
"I am planning on flying to Roatan tomorrow for a five day vacation. Coming in from Chicago. I hope I can get there and back! FYI, the DAN website lists good sanitization information. I am following everyone’s post so keep us updated!"
Good luck on your trip from Chicago! We are scheduled to leave Des Moines Friday 3/20 and will be in Utila 8 days and then Roatan 8 days. Would love to see any information about your experiences traveling in from the U.S. We will also provide updates once we’re there for others. Thanks in advance!
"Also, We have been in communication with our dive shop and our AirBNB hosts, both say there are no restrictions in Utila or Roatan and the Utila Dream ferry is still running as normal as of yesterday."
"To you who will be traveling. Good luck.... and here are some tips on IF you end up with an unexpected long layover! https:/…surviving-layoversThe last advice is especially important. ""Bonus Tip. Be kind.This is one that I had to remind myself of constantly during my two 10-hours days at the airport. It's not the staff's fault that the flight is grounded or delayed. They are in the line of fire and take everyone's anger and blame, but nobody reacts very well to getting yelled at, and taking your frustration out on them will only make them not want to help you.And don't just be kind to the staff. Be kind to your fellow passengers. Be friendly. If someone needs help, help them. No matter how bad your day is, someone else probably has it much, much worse, and showing even a sliver of kindness may be the only bright spot of that person's day. It doesn't cost you anything to be kind, but it may mean the world to someone else.""Safe travels!"

"""I thought the virus didn't like the hot weather?""I don't usually pass on wildly unfounded information, but FWIW here's a rumor I heard a few days ago.The average body temperature of people who have gotten the Coronavirus is in the 90's. The average body temperature of people who have died after getting the Coronavirus is in the high 90's.That makes me think the virus might be pretty happy in any tropical location. At least if it has a warm, moist host to live in.The effect that temperature does have on most viruses is that as it gets warmer people tend to spend less time inside, and that reduces close interactions with other people."
We ended up canceling our trip due to the Canadian Government issuing a warning against all travel outside of Canada. Particularly when they say return back to Canada while you still can. Requirement for all traveler's to self-isolate upon return for two weeks. Also with the warning health insurance may not cover claims due to Corona virus. At the end of the day realized this is not the time to travel. Will work with airline and hotel to re-book at a later date. Really disappointed but the right decision. Stay safe and healthy everyone!
"We arrived today from yyz. 23 people on the plane. Eerily quiet at Pearson this am, and we were the only flight to land on Roatan today, none from US."
Sorry.......forgot to put a smiley face on my post! Have no idea what the virus situation will be at the end of May but I would be (selfishly) happy if people would decide not to visit the week I am there.
"We just got a notification from the Utila Dive Center, they’re closing down and canceling all dives for 14 days. Guess we’re canceling our trip! Urg!!"
"Saw this on a facebook page for Roatan Sunday evening: Here’s the full translation of the Municipal Ordinance just signed for Roatan:MUNICIPAL ORDINANCEThe Honorable Municipal Corporation of Roatán, Islas del Bahía in use of the attributions and powers that the Municipalities Law allows, MAKES KNOW:WHEREAS: The Constitution of the Republic establishes that it is a duty to participate in the promotion and preservation of personal and community health.WHEREAS: COVID-19 was declared a World Pandemic by the World Health Organization.WHEREAS: On March 14, 2020, COPECO declared a red alert for the 18 departments of Honduras, where it says that the Central Government and local governments are obliged to issue mandatory compliance provisions related to risk reduction.WHEREAS: The Bay Islands, due to their geographical location, are isolated from the national territory and do not have the capacity in Health facilities to deal with an outbreak of COVID-19WHEREAS: It is the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation to take the necessary preventive measures in order to safeguard the health and life of the population against the threat of COVID-19.WHEREAS: The Municipalities Law in its article 25, paragraph 15 empowers the Municipal Corporation to ""DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR PUBLIC CALAMITY IN ITS JURISDICTION, WHEN NECESSARY AND ORDERING THE SUITABLE MEASURES.THEREFORE, ORDERS THE FOLLOWING:FIRST: DECLARES A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR PUBLIC CALAMITY IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF ROATAN, for a period of 14 days from Monday, March 16 at 5:59 PM, establishing the necessary measures.SECOND: As of Monday, March 16 at 5:59 PM, people will not be allowed to enter the Municipality by air, sea or any other type of transport coming from the national territory or from abroad.THIRD: Any person who works in the educational system and children under 17 years of age (school age) must remain in their homes and will not be able to move freely, except for justified reason.FOURTH: The sailors who work in the cargo companies must remain on board the boats and will not be able to leave the ship or circulate within the Municipality.FIFTH: The cooperation of all the Port, Airport, Merchant Marine and Civil Aviation authorities is requested.SIXTH: All kinds of agglomerations of people that exceed or congest public and private physical spaces are prohibited.

"In simpler words. A short summary of the recent Municipality decisions:1 - State of emergency for 14 days from Monday.2 - No entry of people via air, maritime national or foreigner.3 - Kids under 17 days stay at home.4 - Cargo boat staff must remain on board.5 - Asking for cooperation for airports etc.6 - Avoid crowded places, public transport must remain hygienic.7 - Health staff has preference in transport and businesses.8 - If you have symptoms report to Secretary of Salud.9 - Business required to remain fair prices for products.10 - Municipal resolves rights to modify information at any time.Cruise ship operations around the world have been cancelled for the next 30 days -- or longer. And with the flight restrictions, even for 2 weeks, it's a nightmare for the Bay Islands which rely on the tourism industry. Many people are living day to day to provide for their families. I cannot fathom what will happen. My heart breaks. Sigh......."
"Thank you for posting this information. Our delta flight from Atlanta on 3/21 is still listed as active but I am assuming there is a lag in airlines catching up due to all that is going on? The US Embassy in Honduras has posted the information below:""The Honduran government announced all borders (air, land, and sea) will be closed as of 11:59 pm Sunday, March 15, 2020 for a period of seven days. Travelers should check with individual air carriers to confirm flight options beyond that date and those with existing itineraries should reconfirm their departure details. Travelers with health concerns are encouraged to communicate with air carriers directly."""
"I feel really bad for the residents of Roatan who rely on us tourists for their livelihoods. I wonder about the number of cases on the island, given that so many cruise ships have visited since the outbreak. If you are there now, please tip generously - these folks may not see a pay check for a long time."
Why would anyone travel at this time? Scientists all over the world have warned that to contain the virus one of the best things we can do is stay put. No travel. I sincerely hope the irresponsible and selfish people who have travelled in the last few weeks are stranded in their ‘paradise’.
"Sunset07, we were only requested to come back to Canada on Friday, March 13, so there are still many people struggling to get home as directed. We were in Oaxaca, Mexico and managed to get home on the 16th. I believe the US asked its citizens to return only a few days ago. Of course we knew Coronavirus was circulating and had discussed whether to alter our plans."

"Coronavirus Covid-19 was declared a PANDEMIC on March 11th. I would think that would have been enough to cancel any travel plans.Edited: 8:15 am, March 23, 2020 "
"Just an fyi. As of today, still zero cases on Utila. Several people have been tested over the course of the last 2 weeks but all came back negative."
"We are booked to be in Utila for two weeks starting May 2nd. There is no way that I see that happening under the circumstances. Even if we could get there and back, I love Utila and I know that if the virus gets there, they will have no way of containing it or treating people. They only have a small clinic with one doctor. Serious cases of any kind must be transferred to the mainland. Please, for the sake of the people of Utila, don't go there until this thing is under control! It's my favorite place in the world, but it is not worth the potential of infecting people there so I can bask in its' beauty. Stay home!"
So far Roatan is still virus free. The borders are closed and nobody is allowed to come to the Island for an unspecified amount of time. Airport and ferry are closed and they are keeping an eye on the water for people trying to come to the Island by boat. Most businesses are closed. The grocery stores are well stocked and you are allowed to go on certain days for shopping. Praying the virus does not appear because this Island would not be able to handle many cases. Stay safe and healthy to all
"I have a friend that lives on the island and am so happy that the island is shutdown to keep all of the residents safe.Edited: 10:35 am, April 04, 2020 "
Utila has a volunteer force of boat owners and they are patrolling around the island 24/7 to make sure no boats try to land on the island. They caught a boat 2 nights ago trying to land and turned it away.
I am booked to fly in on May 7th. I am guessing that is not going to happen.
"We were in Roatan until March 29. The island had a robust response to the virus, immediately restricting all traffic onto the island except for supply vessels. Knowledge of the virus appeared widespread. We did not ever speak to anyone who was unaware of it. Hand shaking stopped, store personnel immediately began wearing masks, ( all stores except essential businesses closed almost immediately, restaurants used gloves - then closed except for takeout. Shores and beaches are patrolled to prevent anyone from coming in. Boats will be impounded! Martial law went into effect."
