We are due to fly into San Francisco to start our California (plus a bit of Arizona and Nevada) road trip at the very end of August. Any idea ??!! how likely it is going to be possible?
">>Any idea ??!! how likely it is going to be possible?<<I think most of us expect the stay at home orders will be lifted before then, what things will look like in Aug, no one here knows that today, it would just be speculation."
Hope everything is cancellable and refundable.Right now the UK remains a Tier Four country. How long that lasts depends on conditions in UK.Best to postpone until 2021. And best not to do this in August in the deserts.
"I agree that it's all speculation at this point, yet my speculation is that whatever opening up has happened by then will be limited or with specific conditions and recommendations from the kinds of things I'm reading from public health and infectious disease people.I suspect we'll be seeing distancing where possible for a long while in California in public spaces, reduced seating at restaurants (whichever ones can survive), trying to limit close crowds and urging people to avoid close contact when possible and wear masks when close contact is needed, even if there are not mandated shutdowns.But I don't have a crystal ball and maybe we'll have enough testing or other measures for things to be more normal than I think.Some other (mostly Asian) counties have found ways to track, test and isolate risky individuals for the collective good and even counties like Germany have seemed to do things like that much better than the US has. Here in the US we are often highly individualistic and some people seem to feel rules don't apply to them and infection has spread far so its not just finding and quarintining a few cases to stop the spread.In the bay area, when we were at the ""recommendation"" stage for distancing we had people breaking the recommendations such as driving to parks, overflowing parking lots, meeting up with people from other households and basically breaking the recommendations because of ""nice weather."" The result was that a number of parks had to be shut down or parking closed to control the people breaking the rules (and people using things more responsibly were also affected by shutdowns, too). I wouldn't be at all surprised to see things go in cycles testing different sets of restrictions and then clamping down in different ways as spread increases or some people cannot be relied on to follow rules. I don't believe I'd personally make any firm plans for leisure travel anywhere in the world during this global pandemic because of all the uncertainties everywhere. Even with refundable reservations, I'm not sure how easy they will be to get money back from if someplace you've booked goes bankrupt or out of business.If things are open enough to visit, will you enjoy your leisure activities in this environment if things aren't really normal? Popular places may have factors such as required wearing masks, distancing, lines to admit limited numbers of people to ensure distance or maybe fever checks at the gate. At least I expect that will be the case. Even if things are completely open or rules not enforced, I wouldn't be relying on other people to look out for my health and probably take some steps myself to reduce unnecessary risks. From what I understand a wide-scale solution such as mass vaccination is unlikely by August."
"No one knows not even the government. CDC, infectious Disease doctors, researchers etc are still trying to figure it out.I doubt CA will welcome internationals by then due to the fact concerts, sporting events, conventions etc are CANCELLED over the summer to prevent spreading which some are carriers and have no symptoms. New symptoms were just added to CDC.If I was a research scientist or reporter I'd focus and investigate the first cases which weren't diagnosed correctly to see where it's coming from.Young people are having strokes and organ failure. Just like cancer some treatments work for some and others it doesn't."
How would we know any more than you know?
"LA Times, SF Chronicle and NY Times are all providing Covid articles outside the pay wall. Our Governor -- Gavin Newsom -- has 6 specific points he wants to see before loosening society. One has to do with testing which has its own technical limitations. There is no way of knowing. San Diego beaches are opening soon and if a bounce is seen because people can't or won't distance properly, that might change dynamics. My personal thoughts (take them with a grain of salt because that's what they're worth): tourist attractions will be among the last to reopen because we don't need a bunch of people from outside the state thronging in. California, along with Washington state, has probably been in the forefront of doing what needed to be done and I doubt the Governor wants to see that all undone. Additionally, when test and trace is put into effect, how much more difficult does it make it to trace people from all 49 other states and international visitors as well?On the economic side of the coin, many lodgings and restaurants may not survive this crisis making the tourist infrastructure a lot less robust than before. Tour operators may not survive either. Or their workers may not be interested in being tour guides in areas where it is difficult to impossible to maintain social distance. Public transit has been severely curtailed in San Francisco. When that comes back is anyone's guess. But all transit vehicles will need to be disinfected and many operators and maintenance people are sick. The cable cars may not run again for a long, long time because of the mingling of operators and passengers, which is impossible to prevent. California loves and welcomes visitors from all corners of the country and the world. But for the rest of this year ... maybe not so much. I'm not sure why anyone would choose to travel -- even in 3 months -- when things look like they do right now. There is no on/off switch to this virus. Even China (who releases very little accurate information) and Singapore are seeing second waves."

"It's foolish to count on any international trip until far more is known about what's going on with COVID-19. Many of us, who travel abroad frequently, suggest that international travel won't be permitted through 2020.Here's the thing, none of us on this forum know, scientists don't know and MDs don't know when COVID-19 has diminished in order for any of us to travel abroad safely.The best any of us can do is provide guesstimates.

"I doubt CA will be fully functional in August, but it is guess like everyone else is guessing."
"1) I would not book anything that could not be cancelled or rescheduled at no or minimal charge.2) I'd expect outdoor things (national parks, beaches) to be open before things like theme parks. So your decision might depend on what sort of trip you had planned."
"I agree with #10 that I doubt everything will be functional in August. Something else just struck me and it's not something I've read anything specifically about. However, Europeans have been exposed to the European mutation of the virus. That is what hit NY and the east coast. The west coast of the US is experiencing the Asian version of the virus. Now, whether the two react differently or have different infection rates or you can have antibodies to one but not the other ... well, I'm not sure anyone knows. And I'd rather my state not be the laboratory and testing site to find out. My personal opinion is international travel is off the table for the rest of this year. I hope the US continues its international travel ban. And I hope CA looks into doing something similar for domestic travelers."
"""And I hope CA looks into doing something similar for domestic travelers.""Down here we're going to the I-8 freeway where it crosses into Yuma, Arizona and string up some barbed wire.

"I read.. I think Seattle Times there are 2 ways it got here.By Americans who were in Wuhan such as the first case in Seattle who was young and knew he had been exposed and CDC isn't ready for Covid-19 even though they were informed..Americans traveling or who came in contact with European, Australian carriers.Carriers can be asymptomatic..While China's theory is bats and a specific anteaters carry this virus there is also theory there is an intermediate host before it gets to humans which hasn't been identified . And as you probably know we can give Covid-19 to our fur family too.And they are just now finding not everyone has the same symptoms and you could get it again after having it."
I would be all in support of the National Guard coming and monitoring county borders since some just don't get how contagious and infectious this is. Vaccines can take up to 2 years.
"I'm afraid I'm going back to my thinking around February 1st. I think the only way forward on this is, 60 and up, stay inside. 70 and up only go out for emergencies. 80 do not go out. People with compromised immune systems and other disabilities that may lead to breathing problems, they also don't go out.Everyone else can start going out. Businesses can decide if they want to be open. The public would have to follow recommendations from the medical profession on distancing and forms of protection. It also means that anybody mingling in the general public has to stay away from those who are continuing to shelter.I think this means a law would have to be passed stopping liability lawsuits. You're going out and entering a business waves you ready right to sue over anyone dying of the Coronavirus.This would still be a big mess I'm starting to think some version of it is what will have to happen.Also don't tell them on the Las Vegas board, but I don't really see how amusement parks, resorts, or their beloved casino resorts can open anytime this year."
"They walked back that claim. From the WHO Twitter:Earlier today we tweeted about a new WHO scientific brief on ""immunity passports"". The thread caused some concern & we would like to clarify:We expect that most people who are infected with #COVID19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection."
"""""""Europeans have been exposed to the European mutation of the virus. That is what hit NY and the east coast.

Autopsies have shown the first attributable Death was weeks prior to the previously reported “first US death” in Washington. Antibody testing is showing the virus was here much longer than previously believed. I don’t think we really know enough to presume there are multiple strains. I’d love to read more about that.
"There is a Chinese study that claims weaker West Coast strains came from China while stronger New York strains came from Europe.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8…Edited: 9:27 am, April 27, 2020 "
"Sorry, I can't read your link. But it doesn't matter. nevertheless I have to lough: for sure China writes that ""their"" virus is the weaker one. But what do China says where from comes the european strain? Has it fallen from heaven?"
"If you read the linked article your questions are answered. Sorry you're not able to click on a link and have it bring you to another website.Here is a summary:Coronavirus has mutated to become far deadlier in Europe than the milder strain that made its way to the US west coast, Chinese study claims•Researchers in China have found at least 30 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus•Some of the deadliest mutations were found in Zhejiang, as well as in Europe•The most severe strains could generate up to 270 times as much viral load•Milder mutations were mostly found in the US, such as in Washington state"
"""""Sorry you're not able to click on a link""""For sure I'm able to klick on a link. But the given link is blocked for me, whatever reason.If the Chinese found that the european strain is deadlier than I have to say, apparently Europe did a very good job fighting it. For example we here in Germany, also Austria and some other european countries have much less cases and even much less death per 1 M pop. as most of the american countries."
"It's probably a bit off-thread that someone in Virginia is talking with someone in Germany about European death rates. But I'll just say that the death rates for many European countries (Spain, Italy, UK, Belgium) is very high.You are correct that the rates for Germany are much lower. Now whether that is due to Germany doing a better job testing and isolating than the rest of Europe, or due to Germany classifying and counting their deaths differently than other European countries, or a combination of both....is beyond my pay grade.One correction to what you said: Germany has a lower death rate than 19 of the US States, and a higher death rate than 31 of them. There is only one American country."
"""Vaccines can take up to 2 years."" Vaccines can also not arrive at all. There is no guarantee anyone will ever be able to produce a vaccine. What if a vaccine never comes? Should we stay in lockdown forever?"
"There are claims that vaccines were close to being verified and approved for SARS, but that ended when it became clear that while it had a high mortality rate, it did not have a huge infection rate. In the end, fewer than a thousand people died of SARS globally, and because so few were in western countries, interest waned although not in Asia.Our current virus is also a SARS Coronavirus, hence the name SARS CoV-2. Vaccine research has been accelerated in Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, but even those places don’t project a mass produced efficacious vaccine any time soon.Europe and we are also rushing a lot of research, but as Gates noted, a lot of that will result in no vaccine. Minimally, there should be a lot of data......often the data of failed biotechs are the most important asset in a buyout.As to whether anybody achieves a vaccine is unknown obviously. But even absent a vaccine, China is mostly re-opened with stringent rules as is Korea. Let us see what happens in Georgia and Florida."
"Yes, Italy and Spain are hit very hardly. But if the european strain is worse than the american strain it should be normal for all european countries.But the reason why Italy and Spain are hit so hard is different: Both countries were overrun by the virus very fast, it was almost no time for locking down. And in both countries people live closely together, mostly 3 generation in one house. So the Virus had an easier way to infect more people."
"The US has both versions of Covid. What came from Europe is infecting the east coast. What came from Asia is here on the west. And who knows what the mid-West has. There has been nothing in the news I've read how the two differ in terms of infections rates, antibodies of one creating immunity from another, severity of cases and other germane information."
"""There is only one American country.""A guy from Russia once told me that when they say ""America"", they're thinking of the US, Canada and Mexico together. Or at least that's what his view of America was."
"In case you missed it on the other forum, here is an article with pictures of what some of San Francisco's major hotels look like today. Some of the biggest and best known and most iconic are not just closed, but fortified. The Hilton Union Square and Parc 55 are prepared for a siege - perhaps understandably since they are closer to the edgy activities of the Tenderloin and Market Street than some of the others.https://www.sfgate.com/travel/slideshow/A-st…"
"So many of us are eager to get outside, again, walk with friends to a restaurant for lunch or dinner, get brunch and sit outside in the sun. I can't wait to have friends & family for dinner or even have people over for cocktails, wine & appetizers. Finger foods for dinner works for me."

A vaccine is on the horizon - have faith.
Faith does not speed science.
"Faith that science doesn’t lie and comes through over millennia, as current scientists work their a$$ off to find the vaccine for the planet is quite another story. Faith keeps many holding on.Edited: 4:17 pm, April 29, 2020 "
"If #34 walks a different path and opts to believe something different, so be it. Isolation helps no one during this time, as SIP extends through May. A quick smile or wave hello to a neighbor/stranger makes a difference for oneself more than for the other person, believe it or not. Not suggesting cartwheels on the sidewalk. Just a quick nod hello is more than enough."
"Other countries (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and even Germany, for example) have done a much better job of controlling the virus than the US.Americans were slow to react and have been less diligent in taking steps to effectively test, trace, and isolate.There is a false dichotomy doing nothing and needing a vaccine to control it. Test, trace, and isolate has been shown to be a viable strategy if properly implemented."
"Have to agree with #37 Australia acted pretty quickly, could have been quicker but then really ramped up the test, trace and isolate and we are now seeing the benefits with a national death toll of just 91 as of today, (still 91 too many though) but far far below the catastrophe happening in Europe and the US. We are still in lockdown in varying degrees in all states but hoping for a relaxation of some measures in another week. Our government started taking it seriously whilst Trump was unfortunately still calling it a hoax and no worse than the flu."
Here in UK we have the next review on 7th May. I have just read an article on the BBC website about the difficulties in getting airlines and aircraft ready to get back in the skies. Long haul will apparently be the last to fly. I can see we will be postponing for a year. Keep safe and well everyone.
"PennyW, yes it is definitely better to postpone your trip for a year."
"We were due to fly out on the 11th May, and was hoping we could re-arrange for later in the year. We have now opted for next May."

Haha Rocky is posing like a rock star. Very cute dog.Coyotes are too vicious in a pack. They can go back to where they came from
"I generally like coyotes, but the crew that was recorded howling at the foot of Coit Tower a few weeks ago was spooky. It sounded like something from a werewolf movie! That area seems to be getting a lot of sightings, so either there is a colony around Telegraph Hill or they migrate back and forth from Fort Mason (just a guess).Most coyotes I see are in Death Valley, so they have a little different lifestyle. But they are like all wildlife (maybe all living creatures, given a chance): if they can find picnic or camp leftovers or get people to give handouts, they'd rather be panhandlers than work for a living. ."
They came from here. And they were here long before we were. I’ve seen a few coyotes but more often in Marin. It’s rare for coyotes to travel in a “pack.”
We and neighbors have heard them in packs devouring domestic animals and you never get over it They come down from the mountains for food and water.
"So are we supposed to be smiling and waving at neighbors who have never acknowledged us before?I'm in SoCal and lived in the same neighborhood for 25 years. It took years to get friendly with even a few of them and turnover is high. The renters behind us change about every 12 months. I do smile and even tried a wave (no response, they averted their eyes and continued unpacking groceries).Are we sure that people want us smiling and waving? I can't tell. To me, it's almost like everyone just wants to get through this as isolated as possible. In my late dad's neighborhood, people who know each other are chatting and smiling (mostly at least 6 feet apart). Outdoors.BTW, the possibility of outdoor transmission is pretty small.California's death rates are about 5 per 100,000 - nothing to sneeze at, but very much on the low side compared to the nation as a whole or to many other nations.But that's because **we are shut down.** Everyone I talk to says we are going to have to restructure our economy going forward, because many aspects of life will probably have changed for more than just this year."
We lived on a canyon in SD in the early 1970s and it was very clear that cats should be indoor only and dogs on a leash at all times. We are encroaching on their territory not vice versa.
I lived in La Jolla at grad student apartments right by the canyons. The coyotes used to pick off the spring bunnies pretty regularly. My cats were definitely indoors.I have been biking around our neighborhood a lot the past month with my toddler on a handlebar seat. She's pretty friendly so we have been saying hi to pretty much everyone we go by and she rings the bell to get their attention. Lots of seniors are sitting in their garage with doors up or on their lawn. We many of the same families with kids on their lawns. We are able to keep distance but still interact. She sang a couple of songs for a family today. It's been nice as I haven't gone around the neighborhood this extensively since we canvassed the neighborhood maybe 5 years ago when one of our cats got out. (He was found 3 weeks later by a neighbor a block away BTW).
I'm hearing coyotes yipping and yapping outside of my house right now.
"The Aptos Facebook page is full of videos and pictures of coyotes, grey foxes, bobcats and mountain lions lately. The grey foxes with pups are especially fun to watch plus they don’t go after cats or small dogs like coyotes do. They are great at getting gophers. Anyone that still lets their cat outdoors isn’t doing a very good job of caring for their cat. We’ve even had small dogs on those long leashes snatched. It’s very sad but the coyotes are just doing what comes naturally. We need to stop providing easy domestic animals for them to go after. I wasn’t thrilled that a mountain lion walked through my daughter’s front yard the other day at 6 pm. A half hour after she came home from work. She doesn’t live that far from Soquel Village. Those of you that have taken Old San Jose Rd. into Santa Cruz know the area. OSJ Rd. goes through the Santa Cruz Mountains but she’s miles from the Summit. She has pepper spray and a whistle on her key chain but I wish that mountain lion would go back up the mountain. It’s collared so The Puma Project is tracking it. The wildlife is definitely getting more comfortable.Edited: 6:37 am, May 04, 2020 "
"The IMHE model that Trump seems to like because it first projected deaths at “only” 60,000, and then 74,000, now as of May 4, at 134,000.Far from over. Glad San Francisco Bay Area counties still have strictest rules of all and without OC crazies to deal with.Edited: 10:21 am, May 05, 2020 "
"Maybe I am hijacking this thread, but I have a similar question.What's the latest news on oversea travel? Our current trip from Europe to California is planned for end of June, first half of July, but I am quite sure this is quite unrealistic. I could change our flight to the first half of August the latest. Is this worth it? If I change my flight, the highest I can get is a travel credit. If I wait this out and they cancel my original trip, I get cash."
"From my reading in various sources it would seem very unlikely that overseas visitors will by flying into USA at all this year, atm our plan is to sit it out until our flights are cancelled and get a refund. As your trip is much nearer, June, I would definitely suggest that. Vouchers are all very well but what happens if the airline goes bust? We still want to visit, but when it is safe. If we come another year we’ll make it a longer trip. I’d be interested to hear what you decide and what happens."
"Additional businesses were allowed to reopen yesterday for curbside pick-up. However, it is still very quiet around here unless you are going to a grocery or hardware store. It will be quite some time before SF is back to normal--whatever ""normal"" is. At the same time, there is media coverage about airlines still flying, cramming people together, etc. Considering how things are going on the ground and in the air, my suggestion is to keep your current travel dates, unless they allow re-booking to 2021, and get a refund as soon as possible since airline bankruptcies are likely."
#56 So you think travel in California for oversea tourists is way too optimistic this summer?
"Jens, you should closely monitor your flights. If the airline cancels, you have a right to a refund, at least in the U.S. The airline might not tell you. We had a flight to Kyoto, party of eight, and we were offered credits. Instead we monitored the flights. They got cancelled, and we got a full refund much quicker than it had told us. The airline had not contacted us.Good luck."
My question was more of international tourism is likely this summer in your state?
"Jens, As you should know, northern California, around SF, shut down sooner and tighter than many other areas of the country. Just in the last couple of days the shelter in place rules have been relaxed. In Sonoma County they're even talking of opening up wine Tasting Rooms on a limited basis, with restrictions. According to polls that I read, a majority of residents feel we're opening up too quickly, and exposing ourselves to a second ""wave"" of infections. If this happens, it's supposed to ""trigger"" another shut down. Given that we seem to be in the middle of a huge biologic/social experiment, I would not want to make any major travel plans now, for this summer or fall, certainly not international travel."
"A limited number of international flights are supposed to start back up in June. California will likely enter ""Stage 3"" reopening in all counties by the end of June. So things might seem vaguely ""normal"" by July 4th weekend. But many businesses may remain closed, and all special events have been cancelled for the foreseeable future. I am not making summer travel plans, personally, and I am not sure my international travel plans for December will be possible. The people I know who are traveling (i.e., flying) right now are doing so only because they have to tend to family emergencies, and I doubt that will change going into the summer months."
Fingers crossed!
Biologic social experimentWell said EricaOver and over CDC emphasizes a minimum requirement of 6feet. It doesn't happen when you do it with your own free will. Why it's okay to go to the beach or walks or anywhere period without a mask is beyond my comprehension. People are breathing and talking the same way you do.at a store. I mean it will travel easier outside than in I would think.
"With the loosening of sheltering restrictions this week, traffic picked right up. On Monday, the KCBS traffic reports sounded like old times, with slow-and-go, crowding on Altamont, bunching up on the Bay Bridge exits into San Francisco. In following days, more of the same, but escalating. With social distancing continuing for awhile, and people's worries about close contacts lasting maybe beyond that, we'll see less public transit or casual carpool use and more solo drivers out there for months.During the height of the restrictions, I drove around the City a few times just looking around, marveling at how quiet and empty everything was. It wasn't good economically, but aesthetically, it was nice to see and hear peace and quiet almost everywhere. It was also a way of revisiting ""Twilight Zone"" days from my childhood. It was an opportunity that will never come again. And people all over the world have commented on how much cleaner their air has been with car and airline traffic, refining, manufacturing, and other pollution sources less active. Just anecdotally, some people in China or India cities discovered that the sky is blue. Better air is one aspect of the pandemic that I wish we could hold onto to."
