I need to refund my booking because the flight has canceled and the country doesn’t allow outsiders due to the coronavirus and I have called and email Travelgenio many times but there is no response at all. @TravelgenioHas anyone have the same issue? That let me feel Travelgenio doesn’t want to refund or deal with any cases as of corona virus impact so they don’t answer any calls.
"How long ago did you book your flight? Best chance may be to contact your credit card co.Most OTAs other than the biggies (expedia, priceline, trip.com) will be going out of business soon."
"There are already at least 3 threads about this.All travel call centres are overwhelmed at the moment, and it is unrealistic to expect quick service from a company as crappy as Travelgenio.Edited: 10:35 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Yes, others are in throat.They are also dealing with Travelgenio, and there are several threads on this very forum.You are. Ot alone, and maybe Search for “Travelgenio” here, and read.Best of luck,Hunt"
