Disappointing news. (Shakes fist at coronavirus)https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-phant…
Every cloud.
So sorry for all those affected.I saw and enjoyed it the week it opened.
"In keeping with the story, I wonder if they will auction off all the props etc. I might bid for Lot 666 ;-)"
"Over the years, we have been fortunate to see it 3 times in London, and enjoyed each performance.Though sad, thank you for the H/U.Hunt"
Don’t think it’s been playing to full houses for a while. I saw it last year only because I got a half-price ticket from TKTS - I have to say I couldn’t see what all the fuss was about.
"It will be interesting to see what happens to the Broadway ""Phantom"" (and other long running shows). The Broadway Phantom has also been deeply discounted, for decades, though must have been making enough pre-pandemic to keep it open."

Hopefully that means Mama Mia will also close and be replaced by something decent.
"Agree with your post 9, Amos."
"Given that its uninterrupted run has now been broken, I'm hoping even more fervently that The Mousetrap will be replaced by something better (ie anything). But no - having just checked, it's already announced its return with socially distanced performances;https://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/…"
Sad to hear this news...seeing a performance of the Phantom was one of my favourite London experiences...
"Cameron Macintosh gave the wrong impression before. It's not permanently closing. The theatre is going to be renovated, so it will be a year or so before it opens again."
That’s fab Neil. How have you been holding up during this? I’m sure you’re missing playing. Do you have other opportunities?
"Dang, I am surprised that Phantom is hated, by so many.Having seen it performed at six venues in the USA (several times at some), and then several times in London, I have only had positive experiences, but that is just me.Now, Love Never Dies, was weak, and it’s run showed that.Oh well,Hunt"
"You aren't alone, Hunt. Though I am not one of them (once was enough for me), I know of a number of Phantom fans who have seen it multiple multiple times."
"QQ2,Fortunately, we have had the pleasure of seeing Phantom many times: Road shows in Denver (2x), Phoenix and San Francisco, then twice on Broadway, and three times in London.While I thought that the large venue, and high production values on Broadway, were spectacular, the smaller, more intimate venue of Her Majesty’s is my favorite.Hunt"
"I was fortunate(?) to attend a private performance of Phantom. A small audience, a large number of whom fell asleep. I wasn’t hosting but, being in the position of an honoured guest, I stayed awake (just)."
