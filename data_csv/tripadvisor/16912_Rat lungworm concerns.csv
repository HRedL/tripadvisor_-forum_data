Hello all!Just another day before we head over to Oahu but I heard on the radio today about a rise in the cases in Hawaii regarding rat lungworms. How big a concern is this overall? I ask mostly because we have a couple of young boys and want to ensure that we view this in its proper severity.Thanks!!
"Aloha,As of right now, there have been no cases on Oahu.Hawaii Island has had them for years and recently on Maui.I live on Oahu and I have been trying to be vigilant about washing ""All"" veggies and fruits for years now.Are they here? Who knows for sure."
"Aloha,I'm not an expert, but I would think your vacation will be just fine."
"Oh, I'm sure it's on Oahu too. It just hasn't hit the news because they don't want you to know. Visitors also may not have reported it, or their mainland doctors may not know what they have.Just wash produce well and you should be fine."
"And do not eat any more slugs no matter how tempting they look! (Read the article.)cnn.com/2017/â€¦But more seriously, do wash your fruits and vegetables carefully - just as you should anywhere else......"
The rise in reported cases amounts to fewer than a dozen. Hardly an epidemic.
