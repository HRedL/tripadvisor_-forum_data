I'm a UK Citizen but been in Mexico for the last 3 months. I'm moving to Dubai (UAE) as a resident when they open next week the only option of a flight we seem to have is going from Mexico to the US and then flying from the US to Dubai. I've spoke with immigration and they said it won't be a problem as long as you haven't been in contact with any of the countries listed in this article https:/…from-other-countries.html. Has anyone got any experience as to whether this is true or not? As it's extremely hard to clarify and don't want to run the risk of getting rejected of immigration.
I'm not sure you're going to get answers any different to the ones you've already had on this.
"With previous threads they've been regarding Spain, Istanbul and Canada. This specific thread is about flying into the USA which other people probably have had experience of since COVID-19 came into place. This will be my last thread."

"I’ve no personal experience with it, but the rule is quite clear. You’re not allowed entry to the USA if you’ve been in the UK or Europe or a few other countries in the last 14 days. If you’ve been in Mexico for a while you should be fine. You still need an ESTA or visa for permission to enter like usual.Given the high case count and the new restrictions from the EU I’d be more concerned about being denied entry somewhere else along the along the way after transiting in the USA. Not sure where you are in Mexico but I’d se if you can fly to Mexico City and get a direct flight to Europe from there."
