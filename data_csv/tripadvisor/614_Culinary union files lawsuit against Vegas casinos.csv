"LAS VEGAS (FOX5) -- The Culinary Union Local 226 will file a lawsuit Monday on behalf of Strip employees to protect workers from the spread of COVID-19, the union announced Saturday morning.""The lawsuit alleges casino hotels have not protected workers, their families, and their community from the spread of COVID-19, and that the current rules and procedures in place for responding to workers contracting COVID-19 have been wholly and dangerously inadequate.""Culinary Union Local 226 represents some 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno.https://www.fox5vegas.com/coronavirus/culina…"
I'm sure that's been eatin' em for awhile.
"Yes, they've probably had it on the back burner for a little while."
This is due to the recent death of a Caesars employee due to Covid. https://www.fox5vegas.com/coronavirus/caesar…
"How can they prove that worker got COVID-19 at work? Perhaps he got it at 7-11, Smith's, church, restaurant, gas station, etc.I feel bad for the Fernandez family."
"""how can they prove that worker.....'They don't have to prove it, it's not part of the lawsuit. Click on the link above."
"Without knowing any of the particulars here, damn right should the workers putting themselves at risk have a say in safety precautions put in place for Covid."
"I might add that while we debate figures and percentages and what they mean, if a significant outbreak occurs among casino workers the Strip will close overnight."
"When I saw the video of the opening of Cosmopolitan I can understand the culinary unions concerns. If it takes a lawsuit to make masks and other social distancing enforced until a vaccine or curve has been conquered, so be it.Edited: 8:35 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"In an ideal world, state/federal governments and also corporations would work together to develop and mutually agree common-sense guidelines that avoid putting workers at unnecessary risk, but then again, unfortunately we've never lived in an ideal world, and probably never will. Retrospect is easy, but in retrospect it was probably not wise of them to initially only require workers, and not guests. to mask. However, as another poster noted, it will also be difficult for workers to establish exactly where they caught the virus. It's also of course true that even the maximum level of precaution will never create a 100% guaranteed safe environment until a vaccine is found, which will probably not be 100% effective anyway. New viruses will also occur. And even when it's medically safe, we all still lose our money most of the time! LOL!Edited: 10:25 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"Review Journal reporting that the Cosmopolitan may have a COVID-19 situation with its employees.https:/…IIRC, the Cosmo was remarked as crowded with mask-less patrons when it opened up."
"It makes me so sad knowing that ""never maskers"" are out there killing and sickening people in the name of freedom. Sounds like Cosmo is also putting greed before the safety of their staff and guests. Their terrace rooms suddenly don't look very nice to me any more."
