"There's an relevant excerpt from:https:/…Modified measures upon entry into SloveniaThe seven-day quarantine upon entry into Slovenia for EU citizens is lifted. At the same time, a 14-day quarantine was introduced for: all third-country nationals without a permanent or temporary residence in the European Union; persons who have permanent or temporary residence in the EU and have left the territory of the EU for more than 14 days. Spokesman Jelko Kacin added that the border police will provide everyone entering Slovenia with the instructions of the National Institute of Public Health on the implementation of measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Strict measures remain in force for foreign nationals who arrive at Slovenian border with visible signs of upper respiratory tract infection or with a positive test result for coronavirus; they may be denied entry.If a person with permanent residence in Slovenia indicates being infected with the new coronavirus or show visible symptoms, such person will be instructed by the border police officer to immediately contact the selected personal physician or emergency medical service by telephone.The government ordinance provides for some exceptions. Quarantine will not be mandatory for: persons attending the funeral of a close relative in Slovenia and leaving the country on the same day and submitting a proof of the date and time of the funeral. persons carrying out the transport of goods to or from Slovenia to a third country, and the transport of goods from third countries in transit; persons with diplomatic passports; persons who provide emergency services for which they have been issued a certificate by the competent ministry and if ordering a quarantine could result in major social or economic damage due to non-provision of these services; members of the protection and rescue services, healthcare services, police and firefighting service and persons carrying out humanitarian transport for Slovenia who are crossing the border in order to perform their duties.The Government's official spokesman Jelko Kacin emphasized that the change of regime was mainly triggered by the events in our immediate neighbourhood. In the event of emergence of a major outbreak in the neighbouring countries or if a significant spread of COVID-19 to Slovenia, the Government will respond to the new situation by reintroducing the strict measures to combat the epidemic."
"Unfortunately, for some reason Slovenia again introduced quarantine for all but Slovene nationals:https:/…People who booked an accommodation are exempt from this rule:""oseba, ki ima v Republiki Sloveniji potrjeno rezervacijo nočitve turističnega obrata in to izkazuje z dokazilom rezervacije.""Edited: 4:56 pm, May 25, 2020 "
"What is meant by that last post? Can an EU resident just book a couple accommodations and then your problem is solved, ie. you don’t have to go into quarantine?"
Yes. For EU citizens there are no restrictions in Slovenia =)
"Sorry my mistake in earlier post. There was no restrictions several days ago and then they implemented some rules.So there is still some uncertanities about crosing the boarders. But all the info are on websites (which also are posted in previous posts).My opinion is that second half of June will also lift mayority of obstacles which are bothering us now.Edited: 9:30 am, June 04, 2020 "
"Ok thanks! I didn’t count on being able to travel at all this year, but may actually consider early September, by car since I don’t fancy flying. It will be something last minute probably. Thanks for the updates!"
"Yeah true. I find them a bit unreliable and incomplete most of the time, especially when it comes to countries like Albania, Montenegro, etc. Since Slovenia is in the EU it's probably a bit more accurate. Whatever is on ANWB website is contradicting the travel advice by the government (orange = only when necessary) - should be lifted as of June 15th probably."
