Any advice on how to get a refund when the reservation was canceled by the owner because of covid-19
"Have you contacted the owner? I would speak to him/her first.Hopefully, you used a credit card to book the reservation. Then just place the charge “ in dispute” with the credit card company.Edited: 6:27 pm, May 26, 2020 "
I paid with PayPal. The owner said the refund comes from TripAdvisor and they have no phone number and have not answered emails.
Your first mistake was booking via Trip Advisor. Sorry to tell you that.I would post on the Support forum where some TA members will be able to advise you what to do next. There is no customer support at all from TA .Thank you very much.
