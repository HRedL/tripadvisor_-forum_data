"New Zealand has been hailed as a coronavirus safe haven after an international research group ranks it the third-safest country in the world.The strict lockdown procedures and rapid response to the virus meant New Zealand was better placed than most to deal with whatever was to come, the research found....... According to the data published on the international group's website, New Zealand is the third-safest country in the world to be in during the on-going pandemic, behind Israel and Singapore.https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coro…"
I would not swap places with anyone living in Israel or Singapore and I feel blessed that I was not born in the USA. especially in these trying times.
I am happy with the effects Australia is making in combating this pandemic..It is the highest testing country in the world and has the best hospital system too.I would not want to be in any other country right now although the Deep Knowledge Group website rates Australia as number 16 on their list as of the 3rd April.
"With you there GTS. Got a daughter in Australia, and I'm not too concerned for her or her family. Somewhat conflicted about my son in the UK, though he seem fairly relaxed so we're trying to stay calm."
"One of the reasons we had to ""nailit"" was that our hospital system is stretched anyway and could cope with much of a surge.Hopefully building hospitals is one of the ways we spend our way out of the recession following along behind this. The earthquakes saw Christchurch get a new hospital, just not big enough for the current and growing population."
Interesting to see how different countries deal with this awful situation. If NZ health services couldn’t cope with this pandemic then suppressing it may well be the right solution But to the future this years ‘safe’ country will surely be next years ‘vulnerable’ country with little Herd immunity to the virus? Future travel into and out of the country would surely be very limited for tourism And business until there is a reliable vaccine.I had planned to visit next year but decided on 2022 was a safer bet but who knows if it would even be then.Anyway stay safe and enjoy domestic travel in your lovely country.
"""Future travel in and out will be limited"". Quite right. If that the price we pay until a vacine is develloped, fair enough.Im not prepared to donate a member of my family so we can all travel. No science supports ""herd immunity"" and if it did, what would be the cost."
"** If NZ health services couldn’t cope with this pandemic**Smudge, I would argue no health service has fully coped with this pandemic. Sweden followed it's own path and remained fully open for business, allowing herd immunity to do it's thing. A high death rate followed and they are now beginning to close borders, shops etc. https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/04…"
**If we could choose which members of society to sacrifice** it was called the Boomer Remover for a while as it seemed to fell mainly the older generation (baby boomers). Now possibly the virus is mutating as an increasingly higher population of younger ages are getting it and dying.
The reason why so many young people havd it in NZ (most affected age group 20-29) is that they are so mobile.There have been attempts in recent past to weed out the weak etc. Let's not go back there!
Singapore has another spike in numbers. Stopped their restrictions too soon me thinks.
As the Australian prime Minister says EVERY LIFE MATTERS so who do we let go with the Herd mentality.I for one ( over 70) don't want to be part of the trial.
there are a number of countries with no coronavirus - surely they should rate as safest (north korea the exception) https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/121023387/s…
"NZ does have a couple of things in its favour, it's an island, a long way from the nearest land mass, and I think in general your much lower population density,and your quarter acre housing blocks must help.Until either most of the population of the world has developed this "" herd immunity"", or been vaccinate, any easing of international travel will ensue in an upsurge of cases.3 months ago, I was one of those saying"" what pandemic, it's just a bit of flu"".Don't mind admitting how wrong I was.Stay safe,and take care of yourself, and others, everyone."
"I thing everyone one got a bit carried away with Singapore and really only looked good when compared to China and South Korea. a the start The reality of it is, Singapore only has a million more citizens than NZ, and it's current case rate stands at 3,700.Even over the last 7 days the number of new cases has never been under 200, now jumping to 447. What Singapore does have is a very low mortality rate of only 0.27%, with only 10 deaths.This will likely climb, as across the globe there is a latency trend of about 2-3 weeks from infection to death, as seen in Germany which also initially had a mortality rate of around 0.28%, but as time has passed the mortality rate has jumped to 2.7%Me, I'd take NZ over any country at the moment for the foreseeable future."
Well with me I will take NSW Australia.Eleven new cases in the last 24 hrs in the state with over 3000 tested in the day and half of them associated with a certain Nursing home.Social distancing is working and I am more than happy with what the federal and local governments are doing to keep Australia as safe as possible with part of the economy still working and some on the books with a $1500:00 a fortnight Job keeper payment.I think New Zealand is in great shape too to combat the outbreak.
OOPS as of April 12th New Zealand has now slipped to 6th Australia is 4th safest Country.https:/…
"Im confident that our figures are quite accurate, but not sure about some other places. Our figures include all deaths, but the UK figures are only hospital deaths.It also interesting that countries that have compulsory military trainging are quite safe. Their population is used to doing what they are told and act more collectively.Australia and NZ also have the advantage that we dont live in as high a density as say Singapore or London.Our experience is also that if the bug gets into say a care home, devistation follows."
"NZ and Australia are definitely the places I would pick to ride this out, and most definitely not the UK with it's coronavirus magnet London. But we have the cards we are dealt with, and we wait with some trepidation to see the effect of this thing on the likes of India. Nobody's figures are reliable but some are less unreliable than others."
#19 i agree. nz only just starting testing population without symptoms. and were still turning away those turning up for testing with sore throats and coughs in our region today.
"These rankings are laughable. NZ has obviously done a good job (partially due to its geography). Singapore, Germany and Japan are still seeing a relatively high number of cases daily."
"Yes, definitely need to read the criteria they are using for their data.4 more weeks for lockdown in Australia just announced today."
"We are waiting for an announcement on the 20th. My feeling is the level 4 lockdown will be extended. Maybe not another 4 weeks, but maybe one week at a time. It seems Australia's lockdown is less rigorous than NZ's, with more businesses able to operate. More like what our level 3 will be like from what the PM said yesterday. It's a delicate balancing act, achieving the desired health result without crippling the economy. Glad it's not my decision.Edited: 4:46 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"In the UK, we have just had our lockdown extended for a further 3 weeks. I think our rules are broadly similar to those in force in NZ, although our off licences ( booze shops) are still open.Now, where did I put that bottle opener last night?"
"Rankings by ""Hungary Today"" that ranks Germany the 2nd safest country which has a mortality rate of just under 3% and is still seeing a 3% day on day increase in cases.Even Israel is seeing a steady number of new cases running around 3% day on day and a mortality rate of just over 1%.South Korea, Australia and New Zealand easily safer, and would trust the figures out of China about as much as those from Israel."
"Yes, I think local knowledge is best and the people living in New Zealand and Australia know how safe their country is.4988 tests in the last 24hrs in New South Wales with only 29 new cases is a great result.The more testing the greater the results I am all for this approach.Total tests undertaken to date in New Zealand is 70,160.380,000 tests have been conducted across Australia."
"There was a drive through testing station set up in Queenstown yesterday. They were doing random testing of everyone who came through, to see if there were unidentified cases among the general population. They took , I think, 300 swabs, and we should know the results today."
Yes drive through stations are great we have another set up to operate in a cluster area of Nth Ryde this morning. We have testing now and results that sends a message to your mobile phone within half a day if you test negative.
"""Total tests undertaken to date in New Zealand is 70,160.380,000 tests have been conducted across Australia.""So basically the same number of tests per capita, 14,902 per million for Australia, and 14,549 per million for New Zealand.Sweden with a population of 10m and their carry on regardless attitude embarrassingly only have a testing rate of just over 7,000 per m, which is why their mortality rate is over 10%, basically a reflection of more cases in the community that are unrecorded. Same can be said for the UK which has a paltry 6,162 tests per m and a mortality rate of 13.32%. It's no wonder they have extended their lock down for another 3 weeks as they are far from out of the woods.  Many European nations are close to or over 20,000 per m, such as Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Portugal, etc."
"The UK is desperate to have access to more testing as well as more PPE Eugene, but you can't blame the low testing levels for the fact that lockdown is being extended for another 3 weeks in common with all other prudent countries.NZ and Australians are so so so so fortunate that you will be able to live in an Antipodean bubble away from the rest of the world for as long as necessary."
Yes Andy agree being an island that can close it's borders does help.Also the fact that there are less people per square mile is a bonus for self distancing.
"Have you not noticed Andy that the UK is on an island...well 2 Islands I suppose? Pretty much same as Oz and NZ.While you are close to Europe, Taiiwan is close to China."
"True Mike. But most definitely more connected with the rest of the world (before all this) with huge amounts of interconnectedness through London, which was 2 weeks ahead of the rest of the UK for Coronavirus. Hence we are the third least safest, diametrically opposite to NZ in another way. Thanks London!"
Maybe we should put plans in hand to concrete up the Chunnel if need be Mike!
That third runway for Heathrow is definitely looking a bit unnecessary Haddaway!
"I know it's too much to hope for, but let's hope you're right!"
"Before all of this we were in the early stages of flight shame, I think that would have grown anyway.The Government here has asked regions for ""shovel ready"" projects to assisf ecconomic recovery. I see Christchurch has listed airport expansion. What a waste of money! Anyone who thinks travel is going to increase is deluded.Our nationalcarrier is scaleing back to a fraction of what it was in a way that looks permanent. Talk is they will focus on domestic, much reduced, Trans Tasman and freight. I doubt they are the only one. Travel will be a fraction of what it was."
I am not so sure NZMike.I think people will want to travel again as soon as this is done and dusted or under control.Requests for cruises is now bigger for next year (2021) than it was for 2019 and 2020 and you know of all the awful results from cruises this year.
"and places like cook islands, tonga, samoa are all covid-19 free. If they can get people tested before they arrive then its a safe place to holiday to keep them safe."
