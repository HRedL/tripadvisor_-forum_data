"Just wondered what people due to fly to Tenerife in next few weeks are thinking of doing. Still going or cancelling? I’m currently in two minds, part of me wants to continue and go and be extra careful, but part of me wonders if it’s worth the risk. Sat debating it so just wanted to know what others have decided on :)"
"we are due to go on March 7th for 2 weeks but as we both have underlying medical conditions are thinking of cancelling our health is more important than the money we will lose, I think it's a personal choice ."
"I think it is a very personal decision.Also, it depends on your age and if you have any health conditions, that make you vulnerable.The risks are generally low for healthy young people."
"Completely agree health is more important. We are both 21, due to go on 9th March for 5 nights. Not the end of the world if we have to cancel. Think we’ll see how it develops over the weekend, don’t want to cancel over nothing but then again don’t want to risk it for the sake of 5 days sunshine"
"If you are considering shifting your trip to another location, it could just as easily happen there.Whether you are healthy or not, you could still find yourself stuck in a hotel in quarantine - anywhere in the world."
"As I understand things at present, the outbreak is confined to one hotel. Tenerife is a big island and the southern tourist area is also massive. This is the time of year we generally visit, although coincidentally not this year. If we had booked we would still be going."
"We’re here until end of March but as it’s been reported today that someone has returned from Tenerife with the virus I am concerned that it could escalate and we could be stuck here indefinitely. They have quarantined bigger areas in the world because of the virus . Personallly once we get home We’ll be avoiding airports until this dies down. If it does escalate here it coukd be very serious. People eat out all the time here ,much more than at home and all tourists have arrived from airports.We’re in an apartment and not eating out at the moment ,but we still have to shop in supermarkets. I really hope there are no more reports of it from here and I really feel for those stuck in a hotel ,it must be so stressful.."
You had better stay away from the UK on average 600 people die every year from flu . Thousands more worldwide.
"At #7, there are at least vaccines for influenza, nothing for this at present, no one locksdown hotels, towns and cities ect for flu outbreaks.Atb steve"
"@Peter . There at least a flu injection,which I’ve had ,but I would 100% prefer to be in lock down and isolated in my own home than here in Tenerife. We have only medical insurance until end of March plus our medication until then too, To be staying here indefinitely would be a nightmare."
Yes there are injections against flu but still 600 people die every year. This kills a very small percentage of victims mostly people my age with underlying health problems Stop worrying and enjoy your holiday
"Number of flu related deaths in England:2016/17 - 18,0092017/18 - 26,4082018/19 - 1,692Vast majorority aged 65+(Source: Public Health England)"
"I think you’re all missing my point ! I know all the statistics. I am more concerned about it spreading in Tenerife. I don’t want to have to stay here and that could easily happen . There’s already another person diagnosed that has come home from Tenerife. This could very easily escalate as there are hundreds in that Hotel and the two cases were only reported a few days ago ,so we don’t know if it’s spread or not .My husband has had a heart attack a few years ago and we wouldn’t have enough medication plus what would happen when our insurance expires. At the moment if I had a choice I’d give Tenerife a miss until we see what happens ."
"The final line "" I'd give Tenerife a miss"" says everything but one other point.There are a variety of cases in the UK and many other countries, both possible and confirmed cases. So anyone who has concerns about going to Tenerife should also avoid every other country for a holiday until things are resolved.There was a lady on BBC1 this morning who was unable to fly home on Monday due to the Calima. She was put in the H10 hotel overnight but after arriving at 22.00 the hotel was quarantined at 04.00 next day and is now stuckSo in order to avoid being put in quarantine whilst being perfectly healthy the only thing to do is stay at home"
"Ask anyone in the H10 if they’d repeat their experience. My big concern is that the health authorities here are opinion,being very blasé . Letting people wander about in the grounds ,mixing with each other and eating from a Buffett.I’m very concerned it will spread like wildfire here as they don’t seem to be following the right instructions. The stories from the guests are appalling."
I wonder how long the 2 new cases in the UK stayed in Tenerife. They say the incubation period is a minimum of 14 days so if a couple of weeks holiday they could have brought it with them rather than catching it here. It is now easy to blame it on Tenerife.
"I'd travel as I agree you have risk every day regarding usual flu and other viruses and as the flu viruse mutates, don't believe it that you are fine cos you've had the flu jab! They often give it and it's not the right one any more. They make me have it as I have a heart murmur but I laugh as I know it's rubbish, afterall my mum had the pneumonia jab and died from double pneumonia!! The rubbish thing is going out on holiday then stuck indoors like forced jailespecially if you can't sunbath or use the pool and just stuck in your room. Me and hubby would eventually drive each other mad with boredom. I'd love to know how or who pays for their food at H10 if they should have checked out or weren't on AI?!? That'll be expensiveEdited: 8:58 am, February 27, 2020 "
You might have the decision to stay or go taken out of your hands. https:/….XlfNPaj7Q2w
Alan that’s exactly my fears . It could so easily happen .
"BA have cancelled flights to an area which has experienced a massive outbreak. That is probably sensible, but it doesn't currently apply to The Canary Islands."
"As it stands today, we're still going on the 11th for a week.Unless it's mandated to not do so by those that make that kind of decision, I take it as just being as sensible as you can, much like travelling anywhere.If you think hard enough there's a risk going anywhere or doing anything."
"My work colleague is still travelling to Northern Italy skiing on Sunday as her holiday has not been cancelled! Yet! Last thing I heard BA were refusing to allow cabin crew to where masks as they said it was unprofessional!Edited: 10:10 am, February 27, 2020 "
"""unprofessional""Same with the bus drivers going to the Wirral. But the medical people were all covered up"
"We are due to arrive on 20th March and will travel if we can. I’ve been travelling to work, going to the supermarket etc. If I’m going to get the virus I could get it anywhere. Hopefully things will have settled down in 3 weeks. I’m ever the optimist however"
"15 cases here, not as many in Tenerife, I'm still going 8th March.Edited: 11:05 am, February 27, 2020 "
"I'm going they're not going to stop it, it will soon be everywhere.Hopefully we'll just have the mild flu like symptoms as 85% do."
"Fuerteventura is no ""safer"" than tenerife.All it takes is one tourist to bring it into a hotel, or onto the plane with you. Or even at the airport.If you are that worried, you'd be better staying at home. Right now I wouldn't pay good money to risk being quarantined in a hotel room, bored silly, eating the supplied bread rolls and pasta salad for 2 weeks.Edited: 11:20 am, February 27, 2020 "
"@grk99 to be honest sooner or later wherever we go there will be a possibility of catching the coronavirus. The media isn't particularly helping the situation, making everyone too scared or worried. Which is undedstabale but it's spreading so fast it really can't be contained. Like someone else has said if we get it hopefully we just have the flu like symptoms, it's older people or people with underlying heath problems who are more at risk to having a severe reaction to it. I think you'll be fine, we should all just be living our life's with extra procautions in place. Are you still thinking of cancelling it?"
Not going until the 3rd of May so hopefully have blown over by then so going unless the FO say no. Over 65 now and had 6 chemo and 15 radio a couple of years ago but think my immune system is back to normal so not concerned yet.
"We fly out 19th , still going , unless they close their borders due 2 the fact it gets worse in the mean time. The H10 will have 2 give sum really good offers out 2 get people 2 start booking up again"
BeckyxAs I was stuck in Fuerteventura for 2 days I took the time to read my insurance policy. My policy covered me for up to £100 per day each member for enforced failure to be able to return home. It might be worth your partner obtaining a similar policy
"Ashtonian1954, I'll have to check out our insurance policy properly. If we did end up losing wages I do have savings and support from family if I needed it. Not sure where abouts to find in the insurance booklet about not being able to return etc?"
"Have changed our plans and are going next year instead, no holiday is worth the risk, i could think of nothing worse than being stuck in a hotel room for a fortnight. I also work for myself and provide healthcare to others so couldn’t afford to take what realistically would be a month off work and or risk passing to others. Jet2 were excellent and only charged £70 to chamge flights and our hotel charged nothing at all to change. An absolute no brainer for us."
That's good carly sounds the best solution. Are you gonna risk a little uk trip instead?!?
"We fly out Thursday 5th , have absolutely no qualms about going , just bought hand sanitizer and will be sensible .Pandemic Panic I think !"
"Need plenty of people to cancel on my flight on Saturday, bit of extra space never goes amiss on Sleazyjet"
"Off tomorrow, Carnt wait."
Apparently this virus doesn’t like hot weather so....
Salcha66 you’re right to be honest. Trying to talk myself into it. Only bit that’s worrying me is the plane/airport but like you said extra precautions. Have a great holiday x
"I mean, we're not talking about Tenerife itself being a massive quarantine zone. If it was China, South Korea or northern Italy, I could understand reluctance to go.As it stands today if I was of the mindset to not to go Tenerife, I'd also cancel any meetings I've got in London, not go to any big city, etc; it'd be lockdown until the dust settles. And I'm not sure that's really practical for anyone."
"We are due to fly out to the hovima hotel Costa Adeje on 17/3/20. My husband has well controlled asthma, so thought it best to ring insurance, they said if we had a letter to say he is fit to fly we are still covered for this corona virus. I rang the doctors and they said we take 28 days to deal with this request. Big dilemma!, to go or not? I'm not a panic type person and don't think we are likely to get this virus, more at risk here in this shocking weather, we are so desperate to escape the cold., but on other hand can't afford to lose nearly £3 ,000."
"busstop13 - oh dear what a dilemma. It’s such a hard decision for people, obviously health is more important but when you’ve worked to pay off a holiday it’s a kick in the stomach to know the only option is to lose the money. Is there no way insurance can sort it quicker given the circumstances? I keep thinking if the risk was so high and serious they’d stop people from going, think we’ll probably go too but stay in another resort.Also, is your holiday a package? If so can’t you pay a fee to change dates?"
"@busstop13 - perhaps have a look at obtaining a Fit to Fly certificate privately. There are lots of places that do this. It may cost you a bit (we paid £55 for one in London), but if it helps your peace of mind, and validates you’re insurance then it’s worth it. Your Gap surgery may offer private appointments or you could try Bupa or similar.Jx"
"Weare here now,arrived Tues after the sand stormsand horrendous 3 hour wait at tenerife airport for luggage but that's another story! At airport lots people wearing masks including staff and touts but if anything scaring people. In Los Christianos and las Americas everyone enjoying themselves,yes might be talking about it but no big panic. How many people die of flu? This is no different, we don't know what these peoples health or lifestyle was originally! But I know it's not going to ruin our holiday, hubby off to Spain next month and we our going to Cyprus in April, we our carrying on with our plans regardless."
"""My husband has well controlled asthma, so thought it best to ring insurance, they said if we had a letter to say he is fit to fly we are still covered for this corona virus""Bus stop - had you already declared his asthma to your travel insurers at the time you purchased the policy?"
"What a good idea, didn't know we could see a private doctor to get a fit to fly letter, might go down the route, the gp receptionist did say we would have to pay £50 for the letter so ok to pay this anyway. thanks for the tip.Yes we have always declared my husbands asthma and had same holiday insurance company for many years claim free.Horrible being in state of limbo not being able to look forward to this winter break as we normally would be. Obviously remaining healthy is our top priority."
"If the his asthma was already declared and they sold you the policy and accepted. I cannot see why they are now asking for a fit to fly letter. So many people have well controlled asthma, if everyone were to go and ask for fit to fly letters from their Doctors, it would become a ridiculous situation. I think doctors can charge about £30 for these fit to fly letters.If your husband was ill whilst away he would most likely have been told by the insurance to use the Spanish NHS using his EHIC card. A win win for the insurance because they would not be paying for his hospital fees on the Spanish NHS. Read the small print on his policy. More and more insurances are refusing private hospitals for pre-existing illnesses."
https:/…Each insurance provider will most likely have an information page of questions and answers about coronavirus. Above is one from Virgin travel insurance.
"We are leaving for Tenerife March 12 for 2 weeks with our children ,well climbing trip and we can not wait."
"Thanks again, all very helpful information, I'm going to ring travel operator tomorrow. (As stated in your insurance info) I will also ring insurance company and raise the question re pre- existing asthma, as the only thing that's changed is this new virus not hubby's condition, the insurance did say they are dealing wth all claims individually."
"Perhaps also ask, if in the event that if he were to catch the virus, would he be in a private hospital or a Spanish National health hospital. (Spanish NHS hospitals are very good indeed) nothing wrong with them. It's just that insurance companies seem to be asking for more people to use the free hospitals, not the private sector. Just seems a bit unfair of them to ask you to jump through hoops and then have to pay for a fit to fly letter, if you are going to be told to use the free EHIC national health anyway."
"we are going to adeje on the 21st of april,and have no intention of cancellingthe amount of hysteria that is being created is beyond beliefthe virus will kill aged people .ane old person died 86 years old on a liner with 1000 people on boardthe virus will kill people who have health problems,but so will many other conditions"
"Defo going(Easter time, for 1 week). Just in case bought insurance policy for 100% refund if cancelled due to medical reasons)."
We are due to go Friday I am a bit apprehensive but there are more case's in the UK. looks like at the moment it's confined to one hotel. Insurance companies don't cover the cost for not wanting to travel so i think we will be going and just taking extra care.
Paid in full last weekend for 14 days from May 3rd. No intention of doing anything other than going. Wrong side of 65 but not worried so far.
"we are going on the 21st of aprilby then if you agree with the media,food shortages ,no medicines,people dying like fliesmy advice go to your chosen hotel,drink and enjoy yourselfbetter to end your days,having a good time.hannah"
"We are here now , going through Manchester airport , all we noticed were more people using hand sanitiser which is a good thing , Tenerife airport same thing .Now we are here no one seems particularly worried , everyone going about doing their normal stuff , would not even have thought about it if it was not all over the British press , glad we came"
"We are supposed to go by the end of March. Everything already paid in full. If I weren't taking my parents with me, I wouldn't think twice about it and absolutely go... but they are not the youngest, so I guess I'll see...."

"We are going mon 9th , if it was such a risk the Gov would put travel restrictions on but they haven't, so my bags are packed and ready to go, as said you could catch it anywhere , I'm not worried and need to get away from the panic buying streesheads in the UK"
"After a lot of thought, (should we shouldn't we! ) I decided to start packing, we go 17/3. I have a fit to fly letter from G/P for my hubby, so looking forward to a relaxing holiday, and hopefully a bit of good weather. I think we are at more risk of picking up the virus at home. Hope we don't have the same problem for our holiday to Corfu in June. Have a great holiday everyone."
"Hi,My partner and I are due to travel to tenerife south on 17/3/20.I am in two minds but more on the side of travelling still unless any development oçcurs stating that travel has not been advised.Its a tough call tbh and something we haven't had to deal with before.My gut instinct says go."
"UK news say today 280 cases in Britain. The government here say 17 cases which include 12 in Tenerife, 4 in Gran Canaria and 1 in Fuerteventura. No contest."
"We dont fly till mid April, but unless our flight gets cancelled we will be going. Both in our 50s with no real health issues, but understand those who have, not wanting to go. However read an article by Abdu Sharkawy on coronavirus (google it). It makes a lot more sense than than the hysteria all the media is creating"
"Allan. The population of the UK is approx 67 million. The population of Tenerife is about 1 million and it has 12 cases. By my calculations the UK should have 792 cases for a comparison or am I missing something?. That said I will be in Costa Adeje in May for 2 weeks unless the UK government ban travel. In my mid 60's, does that make me elderly?Edited: 2:29 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"60,s is the new 40,s raymond go forth and enjoy"
"We are booked for a week 5 April to the GF Fanabe about 20 mins walk from the H10 for our family - 2 over 60 and a 16 and 19 year old. Unless the FCO says we cannot travel we will be going. We'll just be careful and wash our hands a lot.Edited: 4:38 pm, March 10, 2020 "
I am booked for 24th. Its not catching it I am botherered about to be honest its the potential to be quarentined.keith d
we are booked to go in late april for a month and we are both in our 70 s but not even thinking about cancelling
"Has anyone thought about getting stuck out there? My family due to fly on the 15th but I can see from the skyscanner alerts that the prices for my flights are falling every day. They are now at the same price they were when I booked pre christmas with 4 days to go - will they fill the seats? or cancel?. They have dropped over 60% and that is not normal. ( I always go this week last 5 years). Ryanair have abandoned people in Italy. Now you cant just hire a car and get home from tenerife lol! I normally always never let something stop me from travelling but this - I think it is time to give it a miss maybe. Having the Flu is horrific in itself, but having it abroad and your kids being quarantined for a number of weeks is a great possibility as this is fast moving."
"I agree with you. We should go on the 21 st, but 90% likely now that we won’t. After weighing everything up.The airport / flight risk of infection. X two.Chance of cases escalating in Tenerife ( 12 now in a population of only 1 million. So more infected per head of population than uk.)Chance of being quarantened,.If uk ends in,lockdown, which is highly likely sometime in next 3 weeks , then no flights home..Fear of being seriously ill abroad.Other Family members becoming sick whilst we away from uk.SadlyJust Too many unknowns !"
"My flights still the same cost as what paid in september, maybe a bit more actuallyRecreated the order and only a few seats left scattered around left on the plane,Fly on the weekend, cant wait.Spain may end up like italy in a few weeks, who knows, however I feel the canary islands will be treated separately. They themselves may end up in 'lockdown', but I feel that would take much longer than Mainland and major cities, purely due to the nature of the island.Have to say I think tenerife handled the 'outbreak' fantastically."
"For those quoting the number of cases in reference to the population - you ARE aware that at least 5 of those cases are people who are not only foreigners, but also caught the virus when originating in Italy?"
Since healthy people may not know they have it there could be a lot of cases we do not know about. Each of us must make our own choices. As my husband and I are high risk we will be staying at home but that is our choice. For those who are travelling we hope you all have great holidays.
Are these 12 the tourists who stayed in the H10? Or are they also people who contracted in Italy and stayed or lived elsewhere? Or have they caught it from H10 guests.
"I respect everyone else's decisions, it is very personal to your situation and health problems. I do think it is escalating far faster in this country, I may be wrong but the 12 confirmed cases in Tenerife has not changed recently. Not sure but the virus seems to die out in the hot climate. We've made our decision to still go, hopefully we will have a good time and more importantly, return healthy. Will let you know on our return 1st April.Edited: 1:53 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"We were due to travel tomorrow and have cancelled. No holiday is worth the risk of being either quarantined away from home or not being able to get home. I would only have this on my mind if i went anyway, and not enjoy myself fully so happy to have cancelled, and rescheduled for another time."
We are here with no regrets.
"I remember saying on here on a similar post that I have stopped even looking for my next holiday as things would only get worse.Two weeks on and its just been confirmed as a pandemic world wide,Whatever is happening in Italy,I would think is going to also happen in the UK and many other countries around the world.I am so glad I have nothing booked,and If I did,I would be cancelling.The thought of being stuck in a foreign country for gawd knows how long is just not worth the stress.Imagine sitting on a plane and the person next to you starts sniffling and coughing.But looking on the bright side,hopefully it will go as quick as it came,and then some bargains could come along.So for me,its a defo no no to travelling in the near future."
"Certainly, if I had nothing booked I would, not be thinking about booking until the situation resolves itself. However, we have a mega holiday booked and we can ill afford to lose the many thousands that it's costing. It's not till the end of May so things may be clearer by then and, if the UK is in lockdown or the countries we're planning to visit are locked down, then we should be able to get refunds from the operator or our travel insurance"
"Neighbours and friends are happily continuing with their plans to holiday in Tenerife and Spain. We are due to fly out to Tenerife on 17 March and, whilst we are usually upbeat and optimistic, we have today decided to cancel our Jet2 package holida (no option to delay - which we would have considered, let alone any prospect of a refund). This is a personal decision based on a number of factors. 1. Lack of transparent and accurate data regarding local cases on the island (this also applies to UK). Everything is a bit vague regarding location and source of cases. Not sure about the accuracy, but this local news site seems to show that the number of cases in Tenerife has increased to 20 - including the 6 cases in Costa Adeje and another five in La Laguna. https:/…2. WHO declaring a pandemic. Hopefully this will 'encourage' governments to take the appropriate actions. I get the need to consider the imact on business and the economy etc, but this is a really fine balance which is easy to misjudge. Local media reports on today's Canarian Government’s extraordinary session to suspend for a fortnight all social, sporting and cultural events involving more than 1,000 people; restrict visits to patients in hospitals/nursing homes, and suspend all clubs and social centres for the elderly. These are reasonable preventative measures - much more than the UK is doing, 3. Our perception of how the H10 outbreak was handled. The Canarian authorities have said that a similar incident in a hotel would not be handled via a hotel quaratine, but they haven't said what they would do differently. 4. Uncertainty whether the island has the expertise and resources to cope with a larger outbreak. 5. Lack of data and clear advice as to whether we, as seniors with some underlying health issues, would be more at risk. The UK's 111 on-line assessment is a joke., 6. In the event that we become ill, are quarantined or are 'lock-downed', we have little faith in our tour operator/airline, insurance company or the UK government to fund or organise our health/quarantine/repatriation needs as the virus continues to spread worldwide.7. Lack of proper advice let alone proper testing (temperature checks are not a firm indicative) in exit and entry airports.8. We have elderly parents, one of whom is in a high risk category. If they are 'encouraged to 'self-isolate' by the UK government (which is likely at some point in the next few weeks), they would be dependent on us for food supplies etc, so we can't risk being infected ourselves. We do understand that, for the vast majority of folks living on the island, life is going on pretty much as normal and we hope that all visitors have a safe and enjoyable holiday. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected, in Tenerife and elsewhere."
"I just wish Jet2 would take the decision away from us. We are due to head out 21st ( flight only ) We were still optimistic that we could go, however as each day passes and things escalate I am nervous. Currently we lose all our money. If Jet2 cancel at least we get that back. I'm doubtful about our accommodation costs as we booked an apartment through Booking.com. Husband still determined to go unless told otherwise!!"
"I’m with you on this Baldystewart .Were due home on the 27 th .Not looking forward to the airport and when we get back we’ll not be bookin anything. I just wouldn’t look forward to going anywhere.I think by the posts on social media ,I may fill our cases back with toilet rolls and pasta .At least the Canarians don’t seem to have the panic buying mentality that’s going on at home ."
"We decided to come. It’s absolutely gorgeous weather and we fly home Saturday. The UK was only getting worse so if we’re gonna get it we’re gonna get it, might as well have a holiday too"
"Do not book a place with Elena for El Beril on AirBnB. This property should be excluded from AirBnB's listings because the host cancelled our reservation on the day we were to fly out! This was outrageous. The only explanation was that she had to cancel because ""of an emergency."" There was no other explanation. That is unacceptable. I had to scramble to make another reservation. No one who makes a future reservation with this host can trust that their reservation will not also be cancelled on this short of a notice. The host also demanded a security deposit of 300 euros in cash. When I inquired with AirBnB about her policy, I was told not to pay any monies outside of AirBnB. Her reply was that was her policy. If that was her policy, it should have been disclosed in the listing of her property before I booked her place. I agreed to her demands but I think that she was upset with the fact that I reported this to AirBnB. I believe that she cancelled my reservation as a punishment for contacting AirBnB about my concerns.Edited: 9:55 am, March 12, 2020 "
Update to my earlier post: we're not coming as our travel agent just cancelled our trip yesterday (due to lack of participants which means that people here in Poland are cancelling their reservations) . TA offered trip from other city but after long discussion with my wife we decided to get our money back and wait until situation is clarified. We don't want to take risk of being quaratined in hotel because someone is coughing or smth. It was hard decision as we couldn't wait to be again in PdS but seems that was the only one right in present situation.
"Well we came , we're having a lovely time, the weather is hot & sunny, all here are enjoying their holidays, the hotel ( landmar at los gigantes ) is a big hotel but they have an army of cleaners who are constantly cleaning and sanitizing throughout the day, hand sanitizer at each entrance & exits & each lift on each floor, dont think they could do anymore, life is going g on as normal as far as we can see on the island"
"Just to Let any flight only jet2 customers know, they will allow you to change your flight to next yr or later in yr for a £35 per person plus any price difference in flights, as we thought we would lose our money, and this was an option we didn’t realise we had."
Jet2 will also change a package holiday for a fee of £75 per person I think it is so there are options to reschedule rather than cancel.
"It’s nice to hear that your having a good time, we’re due to come on Sunday. We were 50/50 about cancelling. Nice to hear positive feedback."
"Re 571Anhe571's post. Jet2 Holiday's admin fee for changing a booking (destination or dates) depends on how far ahead you cancel. 14 days or less it is £150 per person, but I guess that is still better than losing the lot. On a separate note, for any Brits out there, the latest advice to self-isolate for 7 days if you have a persistent cough or temperature is a minefield. We have just spent the morning having a circular argument. NHS website tells you to self-isolate and not bother the 111 helpline or your GP unless your symptoms get worse. Our insurance company advised that we should speak to our travel operator to arrange for a later flight. The Jet 2 website FAQs state 'If you have been told to self-isolate and cannot travel as a result, please talk to us about amending your departure date'. When we rang them, they told us to visit our doctor to get a 'not fit to fly' note so we could claim off our travel insurance (even though guidance is not to visit GP!) When we asked about changing the dates, we were told they would not waive the admin £150 per person fee. We are still mulling over our options given that travelling with a severe cough (and possibly something much worse) does not seem sensible."
"A lot of people must be cancelling. This is from a guy living in Puerto De La Cruz 'Also news that the hotels Perla and Diamante Suites will close temporarily due to cancelled reservations, all bookings will be consolidated into their sister hotel, the Turquesa until the situation improves.'"
"Thought I should update you all. I have Just spent 2 hrs waiting to get through to tui, the girl I spoke to was very helpful. I have cancelled with full refund due to hubby chest problems and age. Only made this decision today due to the escalation of the virus. Sad but safe for now."
"Received a post online from a guy yesterday to say that some jet2 holidays to Tenerife passengers were arriving at their hotel and finding that they were being quarantined to their room for 7 to 14 days . Do`nt know whether this was spam or not . would be interested to know from anyone who has traveled there recently as I, like you, am due to go there shortly"
Top-trippers - given the current situation maybe 111 can do you one over the phone?
"I’m not due to arrive until end of April. BA offered us the chance to cancel yesterday with a voucher for the deposit (not paid full balance) which can be used against a future booking in the next 12 months.Given where we’ll be in the next 4-8 weeks, I’m taking that and will rebook when it’s all settled down.It’s not being infected that puts me off, there’s a equal chance of that happening anywhere. But if I’m going to be ill, I’d prefer to be ill at home.Edited: 4:53 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Jet2 just cancelled all flights to Spain, Balearics and Canaries with immediate effect."
Have cancelled 12 day visit to Tenerife starting April 4th.
"Jet2 have cancelled all flights and holidays to Spain, including Tenerife."
No flight are going so there will be no holidays.
"Emily - all academic now as Jet2 have cancelled all flights/holidays. Sadly, this came just a few hours after we felt pressurised into paying £150 each to postpone the holiday (we told that we would lose all our money if we didn't make the change yesterday, plus we were threatened with additional cancellation fees from the hotel which was absolute rubbish). Still - its only money/a lost holiday. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the thousands who are much worse off."
"Was at Leeds Bradford yesterday waiting to fly to Tenerife with the great satan Ryanair when Jet2 cancelled all their flights. Ryanair renegotiated a later slot, but we decided to just give it up, as did a number of others.Flight got away ok. Now sat back at home looking at grey skies and counting how much money we have lost.Best decision ever. Good luck to those who went."
"First of all think you made the right decision and I hope you get your money back easily. Jet2 cancelled and then flew empty planes out to repatriate the holiday makers waiting to come home, Ryanair would have had to do the same, also people who live in Spain needed to be taken home."
"We are not scheduled to be in Tenerife until early June, (and booked non refundable). Hotel is being reasonable and allowing a change (as is airline) but no idea when we would change to right now. Cancel is last resort for us, but may happen by default. Anyhow your post was very good and covered many useful thoughts to bear in mind - not least in my view the risk of hotel lockdown and risk of infection. Im conscious theres always the risk right now of people unknowingly bringing it from the UK. Thanks for your post."
I was referring to the items of consideration in #85 above.
we cancelled the hotel so we got most of our money back. But ryanair still went as scheduled this morning. So we can't get our money back for the flights. We are gutted. We have been looking forward to this holiday for a year. But better to be safe. It will probably be pretty deserted.
We were supposed to go this morning (Fri 20 Mar). We managed to cancel the hotel but ryanair still went as scheduled yet they had cancelled the flights for the last 4 days. We're gutted cos we love Tenerife.

"Howard, take heart in knowing you made the right decision not to go. We just got back from Costa Adeje last night, having been there for the last 10 days. By the time we left, almost everything was closed, including hotels, and LOTS of people were struggling to get flights back home. Just by blind good luck our ryanair return flight was one of the handful that hadn't been cancelled, so our original tickets were still good. But a lot of people had to queue for hours to get standby tickets, and even then a lot of them never made it on the plane.I had a window seat, and it was a rather bizarre experience after takeoff, looking down on all the massive, fancy hotels without seeing a single person.Praise goes out to all the workers in Tenerife, the airport staff, and ryanair staff. Not everything went smoothly, but in a very difficult situation, they still came out and did their jobs, and for that they deserve thanks."
Been in touch with JET2 this morning as we are due to fly out 1st May. Cant cancel / get a refund at the moment as thats when they hope to resume flight's....no chance!!
I have a Jet2 package holiday booked for the 14th of August.Anyone predict my chances of still going ahead?
"Seeing as you invited guesswork, I'll go for you having about a 25% chance of it going ahead. I'm basing that on the UK governemnt saying, yesterday, it may be 12 weeks before ""the tide turns"", which I interpret as meaning 12 weeks until we reach the worst situation - then there's another 12 weeks to get down to current levels and more before things are ""normal"". Hope I'm wrong - because I'm basically under ""house arrest"" in the UK for the foreseeable."
"I appreciate your reply harters.I guess like everything at the moment, it is a wait and see job. However, do you think i can be rest assured that because it is a Jet2 package holiday, I can be quite relaxed on the situation, in general? My outlook is I am not going to cancel (it is fully paid right now) and if all flights/hotels/resorts are available then, great, I can go - and if not, i will recieve a full refund or perhaps even rearrange it for xmas/next summer.. Am i right in thinking that?"
"Yes, youre sort of right. As it's a package, you are sorted if Jet2 was to cancel it for whatever reason. Of course, if you were cancel it then, generally speaking, you'd be looking to your travel insurance for refunds. But I wouldnt fuss about this right now. Plenty of time before you're due to go so, yes, be relaxed about it.In the meantime, take care of yourself and those around you."
"Thank you for your update. My wife is a lot happier knowing we made the right decision. I suspected that hotels and restaurants were closing down but Ryanair said that everything was normal. However, in the next breath they said that they couldn't guarantee the return flight home. How does that work? Thank you again for sending the update. We both really appreciate it. Take care."
"Ryanair works in mysterious ways. Please don't ask me to try and understand them, let alone try to explain. However, let me have another guess. And, really, it is only a guess. The airline is only a carrier and, unfortunately, you cannot expect them to give a monkey's about the situation on the ground. If they can legally fly and take your money, that's what they will do. I've never flown Ryanair (and have no inclination to do so) so am not familiar with the terms and conditions. But could this be that it regards each flight as an independent one. Hence, they fly you one way and then say ""Nah, nuffink to do with me, guv"" about the possible return flight. If you see what I mean.Good that both of you are feeling a bit more settled about all this. Fingers crossed all proves to be OK with August. Happy to have helped. John"
We were due to travel early April. Jet2 cancelled us yesterday. We could have had a full refund but decided to rebook for next year same time in the hope others will do the same to keep them going.
"Unless the airline cancels the flight it will not give you a refund. It may allow you to change flights (probably at a fee). If the FCO advises against travel your travel insurance kicks in - make sure you have travel insurance although it is too late now to insure for non travel because of coronavirus.Edited: 12:06 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Harters, your assumption about Ryanair is incorrect (I'm not having a go at you, I'd just rather people had correct information. If you book a return flight with any carrier - including Ryanair - they have a duty of care to ensure you can return, even if they have to pay to put you on a competitors plane, or put on repatriation flights. The exception to this, and again this is for all carriers including Ryanair is if they offer you a route home and you refuse to accept it. At that point their duty of care ends, and they can legally leave you to fend for yourself.That's not to say the process will go smoothly or quickly, but any carrier loses its license the moment it abandons people it flew abroad."
"Thanks for correction, Mark. As you no doubt noticed, I twice said what I wrote was a guess. You seem to be very knowledgeable about this - do you have a source to confirm your comment, please?"
"Harters. Item 2 might be what you are looking for. It is the same for short, medium or long haul. https:/…Edited: 3:08 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Harters, I did indeed see that and almost didn't post for fear you'd see it as me trying to ""correct you"", which is not what was intended. :)I don't have the links to hand because I was on my phone, but its on the Foreign & Commonwealth website somewhere. My knowledge comes from being in Costa Adeje until yesterday, booked with Ryanair, on a return flight... So I made VERY sure I knew and understood my rights. Hey, I was in lockdown and it was cloudy on Tuesday, so reading FCO guidelines & legal terms seemed like a good way to pass the time, and prepare me in case something went wrong. :)"
"Raymond - thanks for the link. The CAA information is very clear - it's actually on the ""medium haul"" page, not the ""short haul"" link. My guess was wrong and I stand corrected. Such is the risk of guessing."
