"Hi, I am planning to visit Chiang Rai from Chiang Mai to visit the White Temple. I wasn't planning to take antimalerics for this excursion. However, the tour guide we have approached has suggested we also take in Mae Salong while we are in the area.I guess this would be half a day/one day tops. Should I be taking antimalerics for this?Thanks, Steve"
"No, I wouldn't, but I would still take sensible precations to deter mozzies, quality repellant is a good start. It's the other nasties the mozzies carry that you should guard against throughout Thailand."
"Agree with Fourb2 - use a high concentration DEET spray to ward off the dengue-carrying mozzies. No amount of malaria prevention medication will protect you against dengue, so keeping mozzies away is a must! I posted a similar question on the Mae Hong Son forum last year and was convinced by the answers not to use anti-malarials. There are some informed comments from DE tookay here: tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297928-i10519-k58â€¦"
"Would agree with the above posters. Althought it is a personal decision you should make with your travel phycisian, I do not take anti malaria meds when traveling to Mae Salong (and I travel there often). Precautions for Dengue are more of a priority, so take deet and long sleeve shirt/pants for dawn and dusk.Safe TravelsBroder"
"High concentration DEET lotion/spray is recommended for the whole of Thailand. There is some Malaria in the North particularly on the border with Burma, but there are only a handful of cases every year. Dengue Fever is not a rural disease, it thrives in city conurbations and you are far more likely to catch Dengue in a large city (like Chiang Mai or Bangkok) than anywhere in the countryside. There are several strains of Dengue, the most deadly is Haemorragic Dengue which can be fatal. There is no preventative medication or cure, the only thing you can do is try not to be bitten. I have had one of the milder strains of Dengue and it was extremely unpleasant.Edited: 7 years ago "
"Thanks everyone - really really appreciate the advice, Steve"
"hi Mossvector,we debated this question on our last trip to CM and CR, went as far as having the scripts printed then decided not to bother, mainly because we are good at taking clothing and DEET precautions, taking antimalerials is not 100% garunteed and when our doctor told us we would need to take the pills a month after our return home, well i just new our kids wouldnt keep up with that!shona"
"Hi all, As my holiday has been and gone (April/May) - thought I would update, in case anyone else is interested. We decided NOT to take any antimalerics, and followed the good advice of being well covered and using Deet. We opted for 50% strength. During our stay we did not get bitten at all in Chiang Rai or on the mountain, and did not pick up anything nasty on the way. Thanks everyone who posted, in hindsight I do wonder if I was being overly concerned - but at the time, I was worried, so appreciate everyones input. Steve"
Steve:Thanks for coming back to the forum and letting us know how it went.Broder
"It's worth perhaps just mentioning that June to October is the rainy season.Statistically, you are 10 times more likely to get bitten and therefore 10 times more likely to catch a nasty in this period. So a strong concentration of DEET on all exposed parts and a spray of the bedroom a few minutes before bedtime with a good quality insecticide (I use Baygon) is important this time of year. Make sure there is nowhere for mozzies to get in whilst you're sleeping."
Can you buy this DEET spray in Thailand? Definately dont have it in South Africa!!! We might have something similar but theres only one strength and have no idea what that is?
Yes you can - in pharmacies.There is a popular brand called OFF containing DEET.In Australia DEET sprays are sold in supermarkets and labeled Tropical Strength - you have to read the fine print to see that DEET is included in the ingredients.Caroline.
"I usually take it with me, but when I have run out, I have bought it in the pharmacy. Broder"
"You are likely to have DEET but it might not say 'DEET' in large print. Look at the tiny print for active ingredients and you'll see 'diethyl toluamide' or something like that. 60% DEET will be something like 600 mg/mL diethyl toluamide (eek, perhaps someone should check this, it's a while since I did these conversions!). But I'd be surprised if there are no DEET products available in SA."
"It's more important than ever to cover up/use DEET in Chiang Rai just now. We have somewhat of an epidemic of Dengue Fever here, they are currently clearing all the residential areas with mosquito fogging machines."
