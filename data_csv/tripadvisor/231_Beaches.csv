What are the best beaches during this pandemic that visitors can enjoy with limited physical movement. I want to be able to sit on the beach.
"As a native Californian, I also want to sit on the beach. But I don't. And not because I am not allowed. I live in Santa Cruz County, a beautiful beach town. But I don't want any part in spreading this virus. I stay home except for essential errands. If every one did so, we would not still be in this crisis. Our governor recently rolled back many openings due to increased case numbers. Please be respectful of following the rules in whatever location you find yourself out of respect for those who live here. I would not visit your city and not follow whatever protocols were set in place for your safety."

Florida is much closer than California. And climate change will drown those beaches fairly soon in geological time. Better enjoy those beaches before they are gone.
"On yes, California beaches are terrible. The water is too cold and the tip rides are dangerous. On the other hand Florida beaches are much nicer and the water is much warmer. Go to Florida, please."
Going to ether FL or CA would require you to quarantine for 2 weeks upon returning to NY. Maine is nice this time of year.
"Hi JaniceI'm sure the above comments come across as being rude, but for the life if us, we don't get why people want to get on a packed airplane with people who may be asymptomatic for COVID and then mingle and possibly spread the East Coast strain among those of us who live here.It's not fun here right now. Restaurants can't offer dine in. Masks are required indoors and any public setting where social distancing can't be maintained, including outdoors.Please travel closer to home and save California for a future visit when it's safer."
"If we Californians sound inhospitable it is for a reason. I, too, live in a beach town and we respectfully request that visitors stay away at this time."
"There are many beaches closer to home for you to visit. There is no need to fly to California for a beach. I doubt your state that was successful at bending the Covid curve would appreciate it. Go to the Hamptons, Jersey Shore, Martha’s Vinyard or even the Carolinas. All closer , all less risk. I live a 10 minute walk from the beach. It’s so full of tourists every day we only go to the beach after 3pm and drive 15 minutes south to an empty beach. We’re in count down to Labor Day mode. We have to work around finding a safe beach close to home , I’m confident you’ll be able to do it too.Edited: 2:49 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"Stay away from our beaches, but you're welcome to go to Florida. So much for E Pluribus Unum."
"I like the suggestion of the Hamptons and Jersey Shore. May I suggest watching a very good New York vlogger on You Tube called Action Kid. He walks or bikes various parts of NYC almost every day and live streams with live chats. If you want you can ask him for his ideas of something more local to you. Many of his streams are available for ""playback"" at your leisure. I've never been to New York so watching these live streams are kick for me as well as a learning experience, traveling by sitting on my couch and with a guide! Coney Island is certainly somewhere you can go sit on the beach, but doesn't look very appealing. I saw a vlog from Long Island a couple of weeks ago. He took a ferry there and walked through the park. It looked lovely. People sitting enjoying the day. Distanced of course. That park is huge! I know there isn't an actual beach, but it looks like a great place for you to go that's more local to you. You might want to just do day trips to places more local to you. I'm sure it will help your city's economy too.Edited: 3:31 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"I am coming to the conclusion that some of these types of posts are meant to troll the locals. The OP has not responded to any of the comments here, and New York has plenty of beaches, as do the neighboring states, as others so rightly pointed out."
"In addition to all the other reasons above, you might want to check out the average temperatures of air and water at our beaches. Even in Southern California (which generally has the warmest weather in the state), July high temperatures are in the 70s along the coast (compared to the 80s in Long Island, for example). Temperatures in Central California can be even cooler (high 60s at Point Lobos, for example)."
"Sigh, I live in Montana and it seems that a quarter of the plates I see around the valleys and in campgrounds are from California. Not every CA resident is staying home and sheltering in place. Our COVID stats have gone the roof since MT ended the 14 day quarantine June 1, but not all of it is coming from out of state visitors. Our cases are increasingly the 20 somethings who think they are immune, and probably are asymptomatic and passing it around. The governor *finally* announced a mask directive last week, although law enforcement doesn’t plan to deal with it unless a business reports an altercation."
"Our cases are also coming from young people. It’s those who are testing positive. But they aren’t the ones getting really, really sick (on average) and certainly not the ones dying. But they are the ones selfishly being out and about. At bars (where they’re open), at private parties and traveling. Recently I read an opinion column which said “we have drunk our way out of opening schools.” Meaning all the summer partying has created a situation which makes it extremely difficult to o allow kids back into classrooms. I said as much 3 weeks ago here. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60713…"
"Jziol yep! Why in the world would someone from NY need to fly cross country to California when they have lovely ones within a days drive. Makes no sense. Ah Montana! My girlfriend moved to Montana twenty years ago and we talked over the 4th. She said it was busier than she’d ever seen it. Yes probably a lot of California plates, but she met a couple people that flew into California and were doing a National Parks loop and were in rental cars."
"Off topic, but it is just not logical to assume a car with an out of state license plate is being driven by someone from that state. That car could be a rental car that was driven into the state and dropped of there and now driven by someone who had an accident in their own car who lives in your state.Edited: 8:01 pm, July 21, 2020 "
Of course Californians would want to quarantine in Montana then in CA with millions of disease carriers.
"I personally don't see why.Edited: 9:14 pm, July 21, 2020 "
How about a very very long beach called Long Beach? Not the one in California. The one in the state of New York?
"Weeell, RedlandsRedhead, to be honest, Montanans wouldn't be caught dead driving a car with California plates. The Californians who move to Montana change out their plates very quickly after they arrive."
I have no doubts that many Californians are traveling to Montana as well as other States as well as other parts of CA.I just hope that everyone would stay at home until this is resolved.
"Some people want to get away and want a vacation and to see something different. The beaches around NY are NOT that great. Of course they aren't the best in CA, either, if you really want great beaches, you'd go to the Gulf or Mexico or the Caribbean."
