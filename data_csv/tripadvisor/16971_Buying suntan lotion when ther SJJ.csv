"We are going in a few months and, based on everyone's advice on this Forum, we think we could pack only in carry-on bags. In thinking through what would be a problem without checked luggage - suntan lotion. I use a lot of it. I could bring a ton of those small size bottles but really prefer suntan spray over lotion. I'll bring just a few of those small ones, but will need to buy spray lotion there. So, suggestions of where to buy it without getting ripped off on the price would be appreciated. At to location, we'll be staying at St. John Guest Suites & will have a jeep rental. Thanks."
"There is no cheap sunscreen on STJ. If I remember correctly, sunscreen was about $18 a bottle everywhere. The same bottles are $10 in the US so do the math and decide if checking a small bag one-way or buying sunscreen on STJ would be cheaper. We usually check a small bag one way and then pack it inside our larger bag for the return. Another option is to go to Goodwill, buy a small suitcase for $5.00, pack it with for food, sunscreen, and other stuff that won't be coming back with you - and then leave the suitcase behind when you return."
"We do the same thing, an extra large nylon duffel bag and we simply do our Costco vacation shopping at home and just fill up the bag, including suntan lotion. Well worth the $25. baggage fee plus we have the food and snacks that we want. On the return home we simply fold up the duffle bag and pack it in our luggage."
"We've done the duffle bag route several times and it works great. Well worth the $25 one way. Snack type items are expensive on island as compared to back home, plus you don't have to spend so much of your vacation shopping - more time to enjoy the beach!"
"Not sure if there is spray, but I bought a large bottle at the store next to Cruz bay landing... I remember it was reasonable. We each put 3 small bottles in our zip lock bag for carry-on and only bought 1 more for 8 days. ( we do use a lot but stay away from spray on for various reasons)"
You could also ship a one price box to Connections in Cruz Bay and pick it up when you arrive. Might be cheaper than checking a bag if you have to pay and you won't have to wait for luggage.STJ guest suites is awesome!
"Just remember if you are going on a boat, most of them don't let you use sprays."
"stxdreamer, are the boats requiring eco-friendly sunscreens? If so, you definitely want to pack your own sunscreen. Some underwater National Parks are banning commercial sunscreen products that have ingredients that are killing the reef and ""genderizing"" some species of fish.Our family has switched to eco-friendly sunscreen products and wear UV swim shirts and leggings.~~~Allfins"

What is SJJ?
When we stayed at St. John guest suites we shipped a med flat rate box a week before we left. It was in our room when we checked in. Also there were extra partial sunscreen bottles to use in a spot near the pool area that others have left behind
We have also bought sunscreen at that store next to Cruz Bay Landing (Fantasia? Not sure of the name.) it was just a few dollars more than what we would have paid here. We never check a bag but we do take the travel containers filled with sunscreen. One 3 ounce container for every two days keeps two of us protected.
I think it's worth the money to buy reef safe sunscreen. Don't mind paying 20.00 or more for the environment.We bought a tube at a store in Mongoose Junction and left it for the next renters.Edited: 4 years ago 
"I recently found ""Safe Harbor"" sunscreen at Walmart. ..Priced reasonably and an ""acceptable"" product rating. I plan to give it a try on my next trip. I use VERY little sunscreen because I have changed over to swim shirts and tights. I was resistant to the change but have discovered I really love them! ""Wear a swim shirt...save a reef!"" (The fish will thank you!)"
Yes pay a couple bucks more for reef safe sun screen so we can try to keep for the next generation what makes St. John so special.
"Shipping ourselves a medium flat rate box this coming April. It is much less $ than the baggage fees so we will just have our carryon. We will be sending large sunscreen (maybe 2) and large bug spray. The extra space will be filled with mixed nuts, granola bars - well... you get the idea..."
"Haha NJ, SJJ is taking over the forum. See post on day trip to Tortola :)"

Ackkkk. Look what I started with the SJJ......
I checked today at the post office. A medium flat rate box to USVI is over $60.
"Make sure it's priority mail flat rate box. I double checked online from my Raleigh zip to Cruz Bay zip.... medium box $13.45, large $18.75"
