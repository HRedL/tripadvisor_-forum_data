Supposed to come next weekend.
"What shutting down?Gatlinburg?GSMNP?More info needed please.Edited: 12:14 am, March 14, 2020 "
No word on any shutdowns other than Dollywood delaying their opening until March 28 at this point.
"Here’s some information from Pigeon Forge: https:/…travel-advisoryMost things are open. Check this site for any closures, few at this point, in Sevier County.Here’s some news features: https://www.wbir.com/mobile/article/news/loc…https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Sevier-Co-l…"
"Dollywood, Pirates Voyage, Stampede closed now through the 28th. Hatfield & McCoys shutting down on March 16th until March 28th. Others will surely follow. All conventions have been canceled in Gatlinburg and some in Pigeon Forge. The Governor has stated no gatherings of 250 people or more. But today thousands walked the streets of Gatlinburg with no ""social distancing"". While others coughed and sneezed. Personally I suggest caution. We get thousands of people here from every state. If we have no cases in Gatlinburg yet (who knows we have no test kits) we will."
"I'm not sure folks walking up and down sidewalks meets the classification of a ""gathering,"" but that's likely a question for the governor. I imagine it's very difficult to tell an area that relies so heavily on tourism that they have to shut down. That's an economic nightmare for a lot of folks."
"This was not just a few people walking down the strip. This was thousands of people walking within a foot or two of each other. Some coughing and sneezing. Go if you choose to. But know that the suggestions of the Governor, CDC and others are not being followed there."
"Tabo is correct. The CDC is discouraging travel. Whether in a confined space or crowded sidewalks, the risk is there. I do not want to see economic hardship for the area but governors across the country are asking for people to do only essential travelling. Most cities depend a lot on tourism perhaps not to the extent of PF and Gatlinburg. There is just no way to say it any differently...this situation is calling for sacrifices."
I read that the Sugarland Visitor Center is closing the animal exhibit abd the movie area. The gift shop is more crowded than those areas. I wonder if it will close. Is it run by the Great Smoky Mountain Assoc?
"While not the National Park, I found this statement by Tennessee State Parks informative regarding the benefits of being outdoors: https:/…1239575440198680576https://www.tn.gov/environment/news/2020/3/1…"
"Will Tennessee shut down restaurants like Ohio,Kentucky and Indiana?"
"Cinci, right now it's being discussed on a local (county) level, but I would not be surprised to see Governor Lee make it a statewide thing. He just this morning told all counties he'd like to see them close schools through the end of the month."
My family and I are on the fence of cancelling our trip.
"Nashville has implemented a ban on bars being open, but some are challenging that ruling. The city has also ordered that restaurants limit occupancy to 50% of the maximum allowed, but no more than 100 people, regardless of the size and that bars within restaurants be limited to 50% of capacity with no standing allowed. Some restaurants with bars have taken the additional step to eliminating seating at the bar completely. I believe Ole Red's in Gatlinburg has taken this step and has also restricted seating in the restaurant to a limited amount."
"There's a big difference between shutting down schools and doing things to affect the economy.I would think it's more likely to see a statewide mandate to reduce seating and limit numbers, as Patrick K referenced with regard to Ole Red's, before you see an entire shutdown of restaurants."
"Indiana is closing bars and restaurants... eliminating dine-in only. They can still do carry out and delivery. The White House outbreak panel said this would be for 15 days. However, they also said schools would be out for 2-3 weeks. Now they are saying they may not get back to school this year. They ask Americans to practice social distancing for 2 weeks now they hint at 8 weeks. Is it any wonder that people are people are buying up groceries. People are getting frustrated. I realize we have to make sacrifices to keep our hospital infrastructure working but I do wish they would stick to one plan and see it through without all the continuous changes. I imagine TN will implement bar and restaurant shut down state wide soon as cases in TN are growing fast."
Sevier County has its first casehttps:/…
"The restaurant situation is currently being ""advised"" by local government at Gov. Lee's urging. For example our mayor has ""strongly suggested"" that restaurants close dining rooms and become curbside only, and many have. All morning I've seen the list rise. It will eventually be mandated state wide, imo."
"Well, I, for one, am NOT cancelling my trip to the area. The outdoors of GSMNP and other outdoor venues, trails, woods, and nature in general are the only ""havens of sanity"" we have left, and I'm not missing out.Not in a hotel with common areas, and won't be ""eating out"" all that much, so no reason to not come and enjoy the beauty of the mountains."
I am currently watching a White House briefing. They are begging people especially the young to follow guidelines about travel. There are a lot of young people completely ignoring the guidelines. I believe that is one of the main reasons for the closing of bars and restaurants. Florida wanted the President to curtail travel to Florida since a large part of their populations is older. Kids showed up for Spring Break instead of staying home.Disney World was packed with people watching the final fireworks before shutting down. Roy Disney's granddaughter was shocked that these people were not following the guidelines. I question why they had the fireworks! It is going to take all of us to do our part.Kat...if you do decide to travel...be safe and find trails less travelled.
"I agree! We were there this past weekend and it was PACKED!! Hundreds of people!! Praying no one there had the virus. If so, God help us!"
"I would note that some of Mike Chase's restaurants in Knoxville (Copper Cellar family of restaurants - Calhouns, Chesapeake's etc) are announcing closure which is huge. They are usually open 365 days a year. They will probably tighten the reigns on the Gatlinburg restaurants as well, maybe offering curbside only or just closing. Right now everyone in the area who is closing is throwing out the ""two weeks and we'll re-evaluate""."
"Tara, That's probably for the best especially since it's a huge tourist area."
That's very interesting about the Copper Cellar chain. I had seen a post earlier for the Calhoun's locations in Knoxville that they were going to curbside delivery/takeout only.
"Reid, yes and to clarify so far I heard of the Copper Cellar West and Cappucinos location specifically That is shutting down - this is from a friend who works there. Not entirely sure about other locations. Have also heard from a friend in Gatlinburg that LeConte View Lodge is calling people to cancel and refund their reservations.Edited: 5:21 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Here's a link for Calhoun's advertising they are now offering delivery:https://www.instagram.com/p/B92IbVynJdJ/Here's a link for Calhoun's advertising online ordering for takeout:https://www.instagram.com/p/B91kW7pFTac/Perhaps the Copper Cellar and Cappucino's aren't conducive to primarily doing takeout/delivery business.
Almost all dinner theaters are closed until May 9th
"Same! We feel like we would still be social distancing at a cabin the mountains. We recognize many attractions are closing, and we could only order carry out - but feel like having the pool and hot tub in the cabin, etc - would be relaxing. Wish we had a better guy feeling."
Skybridge is closed .(WCYB) — Operations are suspended until further notice at Gatlinburg Skylift Park and SkyBridge amid concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic.
"We're here now, and it seems to be business as usual with the exception of a few closures. We were on the fence and am glad we came.wemt to Bennetts bbq earlier and they we're thrilled to see us."
"I live here. If your still thinking about coming do so with full knowledge that the park hq is closed. Bars and resturants are also closing. Dollywood, theme dinners, tourist attractions are also closing. At this rate you will be luckey to find gas stations open in another week other than along the interstate at truck stops.Things are stressful enough around our own homes, why add to that with travel and unknowns thru this event. It will pass, patience. I remember traveling during the long forgotten gas crises. From central Ohio back to Tenn took about 30hrs as gas syations were only selling 5 or less gallons and open with limited hrs. No fun."
"smokey, which bars and restaurants are closed? I've not seen any such announcements for Gatlinburg specifically.Edited: 4:30 pm, March 18, 2020 "
There's several starting to shut down.
Absolutely. There are several now two days later.
