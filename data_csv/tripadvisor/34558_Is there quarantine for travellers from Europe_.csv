Does anybody know if there is quarantine or compulsory test for travellers arriving from the EU?
It is my understanding that EU citizens cannot enter USA at the moment
I didnt say EU citizens i said travellers arriving from EU
Where is their citizenship?

"this is what I am trying to understand. As an example, I am a German citizen, travel to e.g. Dominican Republic and stay there >14 days, can I enter the US from there ?"
