I have a trip to Europe planed later this month we will go to Paris -> Rome -> Madrid. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak I'm considering skipping the Rome part of this trip if there are more travel restrictions placed for us. Is there any travel restrictions I should know if in Madrid?
"Hello,I would check the CDC or WHO for restrictionshttps:/…index.htmlhttps://www.who.int/"
I have been searching for any information about travel from Rome to Madrid with no luck. If I find anything I will post it on here. Thank you for your help!
"This question also becomes a question of risk and reward, risk-loving or risk-adverse, etc. It may be easier for some and not for others. Traveling abroad is a question each of us have to ask ourselves and assess.Other travel options?? Could you travel to Rome another time perhaps and/or are you willing to risk the possibility of being exposed to COVID-19? Are you willing to risk the same exposure at home? Last, if this is your last trip ever, is it Rome?For me, absolutely! ... but that's me. This a question only you can answer. Also, check the CDC website for more information.. The question becomes are you risk-loving or risk-adverse? Again, no one can answer this question but you."
Hello JasminI found these articles online- you should probably ask your question on the Madrid forum as wellhttps:/…https:/…covid-19-coronavirushttps:/…
"HI,We are in Rome currently and they have closed all museums/tourist attractions. Otherwise you would not know there was a pandemic going on. The streets are still lively and busy. If you are going to see the inside of museums/tourist attractions then you should probably cancel, if you are coming for the food or just to have a wander then it could still be okay once it does not become under lockdown"
"Going to large cities is not a good idea at the moment. Travel restrictions can change daily, getting in and out of Italy will become more difficult with flights being reduced an cancelled."
"I second what Polly says (#6). In fact, I'd go further and say non-essential foreign travel is a bad idea at the minute. Just look at how quickly things have escalated in Italy and what it has led to. Other countries are sure to follow similar trajectories, so the chances of getting caught up in disrupted travel (or worse) is increasing daily. France, your first destination, has today confirmed 1,126 cases of coronavirus, with the death toll increasing from 11 yesterday (Saturday) to 19 today. Plus gatherings of more than 1000 people have been banned in France and President Emmanuel Macron warned an epidemic was “inevitable” in the country. Can you see the direction of travel here? Worth it? I don't think so.Edited: 4:10 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"I would skip Rome, they closed all museums, vatican city, and the colloseum this morning. You can still see the city by walking around, but if you are planning on visiting Rome for it’s landmarks and want to go inside, I would not recommend. We have been fine during our trip, just taking regular precautions! If you already have your tickets I would call the airline as it is considered an extraneous circumstance!"
"If this is all on one plane ticket and you decide to skip the middle part of Rome and find another way to go from Paris to Madrid, be sure to talk to the airline about it because IF it is all on one ticket and you decide to skip one leg of it without informing them, they can cancel the remainder of your ticket including your fight back home. Good luck whatever you do -"
I guess you'd know by now the entire Italy is in lockdown. I hope things settle down soon as my trip to Venice-Verona-Milan-Como-Zurich-Lyon is in October 2020.Hope things work out for you.
"Yes so heartbreaking we were so exited to visit Rome for the first time. We will have to try again in some years.As for your trip I hope everything goes as planed! This trip is really affecting everyone's daily life around the world. College classes are being cancelled here in California, and no toilet paper still ..."
Jasmin B: no toilet paper? That's because the Brits are hording it in the UK! Haha!
