"Hi all!I am planning a road trip through Croatia for this summer (leave in 10 days, actually!), and would love some feedback/advice. I am usually VERY self-sufficient with travel agendas, but due to recent travel restrictions, this is a very last minute trip.  Rough outline: Land in Zagreb and head south to Dubrovnik. One way. Will take detour over to Istria. Have a rental car. Total of 15 days. Okay with being on the move or off the beaten path. I could just wing it, but it seems like the government wants proof of where I am staying, so I will need a more definitive itinerary in order to book some rooms. Likes: history, hiking, diving, outdoors in general, good food, good beer, small villages, local authenticity (def don't need a GOT tour).Would anyone like to help this last minute traveler?? What are some places I should explore?? And to Croatia and her citizens - thanks for opening up to us Americans. I promise, I would not be visiting if I wasn't Corona-sponsible :)Thanks, Rich"

"Wow, RiEugen, This is so helpful. Thank you so much for your time and information! I will get right on this and get back to you with any questions when the research begins. Again, THANK YOU!While I have you, one more question:What is the overall vibe of your country in regards to opening up the borders to tourism? Are people angry about it, thinking maybe its too soon? Or welcoming it, as it will help the economy?I would not want to insult anyone by visiting their country too soon!Rich"
"Hey 424, Thanks, yes it seems so. Do you know if ONE accommodation is enough, or do they need to know ALL the places I will stay?As someone who moves around a lot when I travel, its tough to book everything in advance. Thanks!Rich"
"Is begins with adding one property, and then theres a button for ""adding additional properties"". I think I'm going to try to enter my first and last and see if that works."
"Hey RiE, Thanks for that reassuring reply. I assure you, we have taken ever precaution as to not ""bring anything"" with us.As for the accommodations, I have submitted the Enter Croatia form with the booked accommodations in Zagreb and Dubrovnik (first and last). I immediately received a ""welcome"" message with a conformation number and a print out to carry with me. I have no idea is this is the OFFICIAL confirmation or not. Any ideas? Am I waiting for more confirmation? Theres no way any human could have received my submission that quickly. If what I submitted does not work, I will take your advice and booked refundable accommodations at the ""big guys"". I will definitely be staying with the small owners throughout my stay, however. Thanks, Rich"
"Excellent, 424. So, I guess I'm all set with that part of it!Edited: 4:01 pm, July 09, 2020 "

"Hey, you guys have any feedback or info on the San Servolo Resort & Beer Spa experience in Istria?From Zageb, I was going to do 2 nights in Rovinj (day trips to Motovun, Grožnjan, Hum, etc).Now, thinking maybe an extra night more up north for this beer thing, if its worth it? Seems like there's some hiking up there, as well?"
"Or, in lieu of the zipline, the Canyoning Experience in Omis?https:/…Any good?"
"Srdan, thank you so much for the wonderful videos and hiking ideas. I will be sorting through all of it today and hit you up with questions, if thats okay. It seems like I could spend months in Istria and keep busy! Sadly, I will only have a few days, so I'll need to choose just one or two. 424, thank you. I will probably be checking that out while staying in Split. You guys know about the San Servolo Resort & Beer Spa experience?"
"I hear ya, not mine either - it was just because beer was involved :)I'll prob skip it."
"Rich, you seem to be out of luck with that one as I don't drink. :) I've never even heard of the place but again, I'm not into cafes, bars or even restaurants so not exactly surprising. I know of some restaurants, mostly in the Opatija area as that's where I spend most of the time. But haven't really been in any.I'm glad you enjoy the videos and hope they help get the feel of a place/path and even entire areas and the available options. If you have questions (about places :)) feel free to ask. That post of mine was just... a nutshell by my standards. ;) Just be aware of the time difference between Belgrade and New York and that it's sleep time here so you might have to wait for answers. Btw, I do (well, did) actually visit even for months at a time and there's always so much left to see, do and explore. Istria is just an incredible place. So much variety in such short distances. From a beach to the top of a mountain in half an hour. From a new, modern club/cafe to an old village in 10 minutes. From a busy, crowded town to a lone valley or a hiking trail in... you get the point."

"Haha, Srdan, no worries! All the info and videos provided were amazing - and I will be skipping the ""beer spa"" anyway. I haven't chosen which hikes I will be doing yet, but I'll get on that soon.Hi again everyone,First off - all of your help has been SO VALUABLE. I cant thank you all enough. If I could buy you all a beer (except Srdan, of course), I would.I've been at the computer researching and booking, and I'm CLOSE to being done - except for 3 nights between Split and Dub, which we will spend on an island. Million dollar question: which island?We'd have travelled for about 10 days at that point, so looking to just chill and relax. Dive, hike, eat good food, drink good beer, etc.Any advice or suggestions??So far, I'm torn between Vis and Mljet (which seem the most laid back?) and Hvar or Korcula (for a bit more action?)Help me out one last time?? Thanks, Rich"
"Mljet does look beautiful, but it also seems that there would be A LOT more day-trippers from the mainland due to its proximity."
