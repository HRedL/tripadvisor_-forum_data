"Hi,I am flying for a long trip which goes through Israel, Portugal, US, Mexico and back to large parts of Europe. I am however far away from China through out my trip. My question is very specific: Should I take precautionary measures to prevent infection? I have heard that gas masks are completely ineffective and N95 masks are difficult to find and use. I could use disinfectant swipes for the counters and the seat, carry my food for the flights etc. Of course I will keep an eye on the situation.I did read but I am still not sure: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…"
"I wouldn't. But I don't know how much risk you think is ok, and how your general health is"
"I wouldn’t wear a gas mask if I were you, a passenger was removed from an American Airlines flight recently wearing one.https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…"
"You should take precautionary measures to prevent infection - in general. That is only sane and sensible in any situation, in any travel.Not necessarily due to the Corona virus.What you are describing- face mask, etc. I would not necessarily do. Face mask help prevent the infected person from shedding the virus ( be it corona or the flu) into the air. It is somewhat ineffective to prevent a healthy person from contracting it.https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/924531…There are less than a 100 corona virus patients in the US but thousands of flu patients. Yet due to a wonderful PR department (the press) the Corona virus is gonna "" win "" out."
"The protocols for viruses are the same, be it the common cold, the flu or otherwise. For the individual with a healthy immune system the Corona virus isn't a grave concern. Issues on planes are more due to the dry air and the lack of pressure and lack of oxygen. The though of flying with a mask further hindering the ability to breath isn't a good idea. As noted, the masks are helpful to keep unhealthy from coughing on everyone. No everyone has sense enough to bring a few tissues and cough into the tissues. The last flight a lady coughed the entire flight and didn't even cover her mouth. The staff repeatedly asked her to cover her mouth when she coughed but nothing changed for the better. The better option is to keep the unhealthy person off the plane.Edited: 12:23 pm, February 05, 2020 "
Thanks a lot everyone. This is very helpful!
"Last week on a domestic flight, we used disinfectant wipes to clean tray, handle and touch screen, anything I’d touch. I don’t touch anything in the public, no handshake, no elevator button, no escalator handle, use paper on toilet handle and bathroom door handles and I wash my hands many times a day. I don’t wear mask.Not for Coronavirus, I don’t want yo catch flu.Edited: 12:37 pm, February 05, 2020 "
"I flew last week YYC - YYZ - LGW -> bus to LHR (overnight) -> MAN. Despite my best efforts it was incredibly difficult to maintain good hand hygiene. Dirty airport washrooms, busy grimy plane washrooms. People coughing and sneezing and sniffing. I'm not going to wear a mask - that is over kill and largely ineffective. Really all you can do is do your best and hope it works. I took hand sanitizing wipes and used them as necessary, Tried not to touch eyes and nose and mouth. Ended up with a whopper of a cold (worst one I have had in years) but it wasn't for lack of trying."
"Make sure your routine vaccinations are up to date. Won’t help with coronavirus but will help with flu, measles, etc, which are a bigger risk than coronavirus outside China. Every country I visit has warnings about measles On the CDC web page."
"Just back to Dublin from Paris, in through CDG and out through Orly, only saw a handful of people wearing masks.Hand sanitizer and a cautious approach is always good practice."
"The thing about the guy with the gas mask is hysterical. He really did look spooky, but I don't see how he could possibly have been hiding anything under the mask, as other passengers apparently feared, as he must have gone thru security, or don't they have security in TX? I wonder what those passengers would have done, maybe fled the plane, if they'd had pilots dressed the way some of those pilots flying into Wuhan (delivering supplies, etc.) have been dressed -- hazmat suits, masks, goggles and the like.To OP: I think the best you can do is try to keep everything around you very clean -- also your hands and areas around mouth and nose. I am not very good about keeping my hands away from mouth and nose as I should so sometimes just wipe my face with one of those sanitizing wipes or put some hand sanitizer from bottle on it and wipe with tissue. If you have or can get some of those surgical masks take them with you as you never know when you're going to get stuck sitting next to someone coughing and sneezing and dripping and if nothing else you could offer a couple masks to the sneezer."
That is quite hard to maintain! Good for you.
Yeah! I am not good with planes either and try to buffer my trips. I am sorry that you suffered.
Thanks!
