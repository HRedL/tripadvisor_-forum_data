Can anyone help me out about current situation in coorg after heavy rainfall and we are planning to go dussehra holidays trip with our family
Did you go to coorg? How is it now ? All places are accessible ?
yes go after september
We are planning to coorg in Sep 6th to 9th. Is it safe to proceed?
yes safe now for most places in Coorg.This time while the access to Nadikeri via Mysore Kushalnagar is fine some sections of roads towards Irrupu Falls from Virajpet have got affected as also ghat sections on Mangalore Madikeri route.
The situation has improved a lot. Although there is incessant rain but road conditions are OK to travel and most tourist spots are open except Mandalpatty hills and Talacauvery. Best to postpone trip if possible then these spots will open as well.
Hi have there been any more rains ? We are planning to go from Bangalore to Coorg by car this weekend. Just checking if its safe now?
is it safe to travel to Coorg in first week of October?
