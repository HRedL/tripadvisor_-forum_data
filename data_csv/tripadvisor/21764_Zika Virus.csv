Hi all.. I am travelling to Paris next month (February 2020) and I saw that France has been recently added to the Zika advisory list. My husband and I are trying to conceive so we are just worried if it is all bad as the internet says it is. Does this seem to be a concern to anyone travelling or living in Paris? TIA
"Zika is present in ""France"" mostly in some oversea territories (so thousands of km from Paris). In 2019, there has been nine official cases of the Zika virus in mainland France, 6 were ""imported"" (travelers that have contracted the virus abroad) and 3 were ""native"" (people who didn't travel to an infected country). Those 3 were in Cote d'Azur. https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-… (sorry, link in French).I let you decide if it is a concern for you (for me, no)."
Mosquitoes in Paris in February ? I think not.
"I donrt know where youre from, but would zika stop you travelling to the US, which shows on the map as the same level of danger?"
"""we are just worried if it is all bad as the internet says it is""Nothing is ever as bad as the internet says it is.Again you don't say where you're from but I just checked travel.gc.ca and Canada has nothing regarding Zika under travel warnings for France."
"welcome,No one on TA is vetted.No one can give you assurance on life.If you can talk to a doctor and or a doctor that is versed in bugs and travel, go talk to them. Again, no one on TA is vetted. Paris is not going anywhere and if you want to hold off, you can, and go after you had your kid(s). good luck"
Ten years might be a good time to wait for one of our one-post wonders.
"Zika is far more prevalent, more established in the US than it is in Paris. I don´t know where you are from but I only worry about Zika when I visit the US."
I saw the Zika title and thought I was in the Orlando forum. That question comes up repeatedly by U.K tourists coming to Florida.:o)
"My daughter's OB would not allow her to do business travel to Florida when she was pregnant because of the real danger there. I doubt Paris in winter is a risk but the Riviera might be.A bigger risk is listeria which is always a risk with many types of foods including charcuterie, salads etc."
I thought the next virus thread that pops up would be about the Corona Virus..
"Chikungunya would be more logical to worry about in France, but since nobody is logical here..."
"Corona is a done deal there are over 100,000 people in China sick with it and they are lying about its extent (or so I read this morning). It is out of the bag. Just a matter of time."

"Just spoke to my French doctor about my concerns about coronavirus, and her opinion abut it is that although it's highly infectious, if you are a healthy person it won't be fatal. PS She agreed with me that this is maybe not a good time to visit the Louvre or other large museums here. Just sayin'"
"> My daughter's OB would not allow her to do business travel to Florida when she was pregnant because of the real danger there. <Well, the *perceived* real danger. At its peak for Florida (2016), there were just over 200 (presumed) local transmissions in the entire state of Florida. Almost all in south Florida - none in Central Florida, but that didn't stop the panic over going to Disney World. As a comparison, there have been10x that number of the food borne, Hepatitis A cases each year for the last few years in Florida."
"Anouk, if you live in Miami, you are at far greater risk of Zika exposure at home than you would ever be in Paris.As far as advice to avoid crowded museums, that’s good advice for anyone who might be concerned about exposure (due to health status or compromised immunity) to any virus including the seasonal flu. (& parts of the Louvre are sardine-level crowded)"
The Corona virus is in Germany and I guess other countries too. The 2 infected in Paris and Bordeaux are contained. People freaked with SARS..
"LovesSunnyIsles, Yes, exactly. I don't like large crowded anyway, so I will avoid the Louvre for the time being."
Here's a story about the Coronavirus and tourism: https://tinyurl.com/yx26w59n
"Jamie -- most people who travel have (or should have) Hep A vaccinations. Zika destroys the future of a child -- no risk of that is reasonable if avoidable. And Listeria is spread in salads, charcuteries etc etc as well as soft unpasteurized cheeses and raw fish. It is fatal to late term fetuses which is not as big a risk as Zika which doesn't kill but drastically damages the brains of unborn infants.My grandmother died in the 1918 epidemic -- Corono is appearing to be stacking up to be of similar impact and is apparently not going to be well contained. There are still huge groups of people from Wuhan flying out of China -- there was a big fuss today in Hong Kong about a plane boarding a dozen people from this city. Since the disease may take 14 days to appear anyone could be a carrier infecting a plane load of people. The world is in for a few months of this.The US used to have an office specifically focused on pandemics -- that was abolished under Trump and the CDC has been crippled. I have to assume that the US is going to deal with this incompetently. FWIW, although masks are thought to be useless, all the pharmacies near us have long been sold out and on line sites have long backlogs.Edited: 4:39 pm, January 28, 2020 "
"""huge groups""....""a dozen people""....?Might the ""huge groups"" refer to efforts by some nations to remove their citizens via special charters - hundreds at a time? Thereby exporting, if we are to believe the hype, opportunities to deliver the virus into their home countries? And then blaming China? Medical opinion seems to be conflicted - some say that isolation/quarantine is the way to restrict distribution; others say it won't work. This is not the first epidemic where avoiding crowds is recommended - it happens in my home town during flu season when it coincides with the local agricultural show. Much to the annoyance of the organisers and sponsors.Mind you, isolation is applied for dealing with novovirus on board cruise ships. It might just be harder to manage on the scale being attempted in China. The reportage, even from our usually sober Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is somewhat breathless with one exaggeration piled on another. For example, a street squabble involving what looked like half a dozen people over Hubei residents visiting elsewhere is conflated into the equivalent of people being chased down streets. Then there is the high-energy, rapid, shouty commentary - stoking the emotional tension to ""hold the audience"". Like a story on a pandemic won't! Some medical advice boils down to ""wash your hands regularly"". That might well apply on an aircraft - in any circumstances. The usual commentary is that aircraft airconditioning does not distribute infections. Corona is spread by direct contact, including droplets. Any chance passengers will avoid that crazy press of people exiting the aircraft? Stay calm - wash your hands."
Corona is contagious through the air i.e. having a conversation or breathing; it does not require contact although like colds and flu it is also on surfaces and thus washing hands and so forth is useful -- and 12 people on an airplane from a restricted area are a huge number. I bet you would think so if it were your plane. China does not seem to be enforcing travel bans very well. ONe of the people who spread the disease in Europe had symptoms and was still screened and send on their way to travel. This one is out of the barn and is not going to be contained. We can only hope that it turns out to be a lot milder than feared Perhaps there are 100s of thousands who have contracted it in milder form and thus the death rate is pessimistic. And of course aircrafts recirculating air are also circulating viruses. and the masks everyone is wearing will stop droplets from sneezes which is not nothing but they won't stop viruses floating in the air as they are not fine enough to do so.
">> Jamie -- most people who travel have (or should have) Hep A vaccinations. Zika destroys the future of a child -- no risk of that is reasonable if avoidable. <<My point wasn't specifically about Hepatitis -- my point was about the (over) reaction to the miniscule odds of contracting in the U.S.Maybe I should have used toxoplasmosis as an example. It also can have a devastating effect on unborn children. Millions of cases of infection a year (not a few hundred) and less than half of pregnant women are self-immunized from previous infection. Yet, very few pregnant women stop eating raw vegetables, get rid of their pet cat, or stop gardening (some of the lead transmission sources)."
"Jaime, interestingly (or perhaps not), in France it is routine to test all pregnant woman regularly for toxoplasmosis exposure, & a much higher percentage of women in France have had prior exposure than in the US, perhaps due to different eating habits (more raw salads & vegetables, etc). among Frenchwomen. (Can’t blame the difference on cats)Even so, pregnant women in France are given the same dietary precautions re raw cheeses, raw salads, charcuterie, uncooked fish & meats etc. But they are also tested for some viruses that are not routinely tested for in the US. Zika has not been a big concern in Metropolitan France, though it has been an issue in the Caribbean & other tropical overseas Departments.Edited: 10:35 pm, January 28, 2020 "

"I believe the expression means once the horse is out of the barn it’s too late to lock the door.....as Janet said, too late to contain spread of infection from at least that one person.

Terrified to the extent that they're just not bothered...
"No-one is terrified - since the five cases so far confirmed (all being treated in isolation in specialist hospitals) are recent arrivals from China and there is no reason at all to suppose that the general population is at risk.If this is worrying for you, I would stay home, since many countries have a few cases and some countries have a lot more."
"We do have the seasonal flu though, if you need something to be worried about."
"Going round? It is too late to lock the barn door once the horse has escaped (or bolted) is not an idiom in your part of the English speaking world? It is in the UK and the US. None of us is going to know the risk for awhile. It seems unlikely that the virus will be contained given that contagion is airborne (all that handwashing won't prevent breathing in the virus) and that a lot of travel was allowed by infected people before more serious attempts were made. We don't know how serious it is; flu kills too; this one appears to be more lethal but we don't know that because we don't know how widespread it is.FWIW. trip insurance will not cover cancellation of travel because you fear the epidemic. We are in wait and see mode for coming travel. No one has enough information to make a a decision, although unbooked travel might wisely be postponed.There is no reason to think Paris is particularly at risk any more than any other major international city.And back to Zika -- same precautions apply i.e. if you live in an area with it and are pregnant then you protect yourself from insect bites and hope for the best. If you can avoid visiting an area where it is endemic then you do so. Doesn't matter if the risk is small when it is that catastrophic you don't take the risk unnecessarily. (and yes you are more likely to die in a car accident)Edited: 12:23 pm, January 30, 2020 "
The only reason that there were more cases of coronavirus in Paris than other European countries is because Pars is the #1 European destination of Chinese tourists. There are plenty of other European cities that you could visit that don't interest Chinese visitors at all. Belgrade? Talinn? Kiev?
LovesSunny...absolutely true regarding toxoplasmosis tests; I'm wondering if you had a baby there. My whole pregnancy in Paris I had a test every 4 weeks. Nail biting fear about results but very important. All turned out well. I still get cross when people don't pick up their dog's poo when you consider the danger of toxacara canis to babies and children. And same for washing hands - amazing how many illnesses could be stopped in their tracks. Wash your hands when you get home before you touch anything.
I think the OP might be related to anouk. ;)
">>LovesSunny...absolutely true regarding toxoplasmosis tests; I'm wondering if you had a baby there<<@littlelamb, we’ve had several grandchildren born in recent years in both Paris & NYC. Quite a few differences in French & US pre- & post-natal care protocols. (have to say I think mothers and babies get better care in France; not being political, just commenting on the personal experiences of my children (& their friends) & grandchildren in both countries)"
"By the way, my French family was far more concerned about potential measles exposure when visiting the US (due to outbreaks in NYC area in some unvaccinated communities which put many people at risk, especially children too young to be vaccinated) than they are concerned right now about coronavirus at home in Paris. Now the seasonal “gastro” in France is another story....but again just wash your hands often.(& be sure to keep your immunizations up to date for those illnesses against which we do have some protection)"
"And back to original query of OP, my Parisian daughter, & her friends pregnant around the same times in recent years, were never cautioned about any Zika risk in Paris. However, they were all advised (by their doctors & midwives in France) not to visit parts of the Caribbean or even Florida.My American daughter-in-law was also advised by her doctors in NYC not to visit Caribbean or Florida; but no issue at all with her visiting our family in Paris.If you have concerns, check with your own doctors of course. But no reason for Zika to be a concern for a visit to Paris, especially in the winter. (French West Indies might be a concern, not Paris)Bon voyage...Edited: 4:11 pm, January 30, 2020 "
"""stable door"" down this way, for horses, Janet. Horses, being noble creatures, can happily be metaphors for people. Not so much some of the other animals housed in barns in colder climates.Ah, English - separated by a common language again!"
"Out of the gate, as in the races. Isn't that when it's too late to place your bets."
