"That CNA link makes no mention of Vietnam.You wrote a few days ago you ""have to cancel"" your Vietnam/Asia trip. Changed your mind? Not going to New Zealand?"
"> That CNA link makes no mention of Vietnam.Well, it mentions that The Korean times is reporting that > South Korea has ""strongly advised"" its citizens to refrain from travelling to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and Taiwanbut it's really of very little interest here. There's realy no need for new threads on the subject.FWIW, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health moh.gov.vn links to https://suckhoedoisong.vn/ which is regularly updated with the situation in Vietnam. Apart from that, people would be well advised to read their own government's advice:UK: https:/…healthAU: https:/…novel-coronavirus-outbreakUS: https:/…Vietnam.htmletcThere's also plenty of local news at https://tuoitre.vn/ https://tuoitrenews.vn/ https://vietnamnews.vn/ etc But nobody can predict the future with certainty."
