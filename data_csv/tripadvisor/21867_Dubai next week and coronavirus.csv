We are travelling from Luxembourg to Dubai next week. Is there high risk to get coronavirus? Is there any panick? Or business as usual. Thanks
"Risk is always subjective.I can only go on what the media are publishing, but i believe there have been 5 confirmed cases in the UAE, all of which are of Chinese origin.The latest (5th person) was from the Wuhan area (the original source of the virus) and has been quarantined as per WHO guidelines.Again, only from media reports, the mortality rate is currently sitting at around 2%, this is far less than Sars (around 10%) and Ebola (90%) and the majority of people who have died, have had pre existing conditions. There are theories running around that its more like 150,000 that are affected and the Chinese government are trying to cover it up (rather than the 25,000 reported), which would infact reduce the mortality rate to 0.3%.As of today, only 2 people have been reported to have died from the Coronavirus outside of china, 1 in Hong Kong who had been to Wuhan and had underlying severe health problems and 1 in the Philippines who was a resident of Wuhan.Source:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/While the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. To avoid any viral illness, experts advise keeping up general basic hygeine and washing your hands frequently and maybe use an alcohol based hand sanitiser to keep germs at bay."
"I understand the question - I am still debating whether I will travel (Londen duba) in half term later this month with my two under 5’s. I’ve seen some photos of people in Dubai wearing masks, mostly appear to be of Asian origin. Is that something common now on the streets there or not? Here in Holland nobody wears them at the moment."
"Regarding masks, a lot of mask wearing people in Dubai belong to one particular expat community, which is over represented in customer facing roles, and as such it would appear that a lot of people are wearing it. One can also argue that if they have customer facing roles, that is a good argument for mask-wearingThat is not to say there is no risk, but certain groups of people do tend to panic more than others. i would still not consider a trip to Dubai to be risky but that is my subjective opinion"
I've been in Dubai last weekend and I don't feel there is any risk at the moment. People are acting normally and there is a few number of people wearing masks. Enjoy your trip and no worry!
Thew risk to you and your family is probably the same as the risk of staying in Luxembourg so on that basis why would you cancel a holiday and lose the money you have paid ?
"I had advise from Doctor ...drop mask unless u really butya surgery one super tight ....the normal ones are worse for you . WASH hands disinfect hands after allpublic places do not go for Buffet or be FIRST !!! and i hate to say this ....stay a little awy from sneezing chinese peopel ...I travel myself to dubai !Edited: 11:00 pm, February 13, 2020 "
"It’s business as usual in Dubai streets except the oddly few here and there wearing masks. You have a higher chance of getting hit by a car or hit by lightning!!Edited: 11:27 pm, February 13, 2020 "
"People have been wearing masks in Dubai (and elsewhere) *long before* it became in vogue to decry/accuse every Chinese person for spreading a virus.Every morning your car is blanketed by a fine layer of dust. And, this is what you inhale with every breath you take ..."

"""The mask wearing is totally superfluous and serves little purpose.""As far as the virus is concerned, yes. Presumably this is why most are wearing them. But, as mentioned, people were wearing the mask long before the Corona virus.Personally, I'd be happy that others were wearing the mask ..."
"@FrankAB_10,When you say things like “stay a little awy from sneezing chinese peopel .” you fuel racism. Even if you say before you hate to say it, the fact is you did say it. Would you feel less threatened if an infected Caucasian sneezed at you or a non infected Asian? Think about that one - the one you were less threatened by infected you. How would you feel then ? After 9/11, some Moslem doctors couldn’t get work. Many drove taxis. This was because of things like what you said getting out of hand. Please consider your words carefully next time.As for the masks, if you have a cold and are flying, please be considerate and wear one.Thank youEdited: 12:01 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"Hi Frank,Here is a useful article to readPhan, writing in the Guardian, appealed for compassion over fear. “It’s important it is to see us in all our diversity, as individual human beings, and to challenge stereotypes. The coronavirus is a human tragedy, so let’s not allow fear to breed hatred, intolerance and racism,” he wrote.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-chinese…BillEdited: 12:07 am, February 19, 2020 "
"Hi Dolux, have you been to Dubai already ?"
"Yes. Finally we decided to go. Now we are in the airport, flying back. Dubai looked safe. But the airport full of people with masks.Edited: 3:57 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"Dont be too alarmed for the masks, be thankful. If they sneeze or cough, you wont catch it! I hope you have alot of fun! do reply back and let us know once you're safely home about your highlights and reccomendations.Edited: 5:42 pm, February 20, 2020 "
I am also in a kind of dilemma . I have a trip planned to dubai around mid or march (Delhi to Dubai)I still have an option to cancel/postpone the Flight tickets . Should I postpone the Trip or continue with it
"Hi Karan, why would Dubai be any more risky than anywhere else at present?"
"@ Karan - what's your decision after reading all the other posts in this (and similar) threads, and checking the approporate links that have been posted then?"
"Coronavirus Cases: 77,987Deaths:2,362Recovered:21,318This means it’s a global epidemic that’s only going to get a lot, possibly a hell of a lot worse, before it gets better. Now let’s consider Dubai: 13 cases zero deaths.It’s probably better to come now as fewer cases IMO. If you delay it will probably be worse"
"Finally I have decided to cancel the travel plans after lots of consideration. Coronovirus cases are increasing on daily basis and it can even get worse in 3-4 weeks from now (My travel dates)The main risk zones are the Airports. Specially the Dubai Airport (of course any big International Airport) Also yesterday 1 unique case of Coronovirus shocked me Where a girl having no symptoms of virus , negative test results and even after proper screening was actually infected by the virus (this(likely) cause widespread of infection in her family 4-5 members)Finally I decided to cancel this Leisure trip :( and revisit it in a few monthsEdited: 12:10 am, February 23, 2020 "
"Sorry to hear that Karan.We have a visit planned in just under 2 weeks, we had the option to cancel with minimum loss, but we have decided to still go.The risk in Dubai IMHO is still very low and the high majority of critical cases are with the elderly and with pre existing conditions, COVID-19 Fatality Rate by AGE:AGE - DEATH RATE80+ years old - 14.8%70-79 years old - 8.0%60-69 years old - 3.6%50-59 years old - 1.3%40-49 years old - 0.4%30-39 years old - 0.2%20-29 years old - 0.2%10-19 years old - 0.2%0-9 years old - no fatalities COVID-19 Fatality Rate by COMORBIDITY:PRE-EXISTING CONDITION - DEATH RATECardiovascular disease - 10.5%Diabetes - 7.3%Chronic respiratory disease - 6.3%Hypertension - 6.0%Cancer - 5.6%no pre-existing conditions - 0.9%Give the fact im in my forties and i have no pre-existing conditions, there is no question in my mind to consider cancelking...Edited: 2:08 am, February 23, 2020 "
"That's a shame Karan, of course, it's a personal decision and it can't have been easy. Sometimes 'peace of mind' is most important of all.Good luck to you, and go well.Edited: 3:11 am, February 23, 2020 "
Yes and i forgot to mention my parents were also joining me in the trip (both ~60 ) and hypertension patient so I didn’t wanted to take any risk with them
"Wow Darren, thats really impressive - where did you get your figures from ?Also be aware of new research coming in reporting of an unconventional route of transmission as reported in Fortune magazine Feb 20th.""Fecal transmission may be responsible for coronavirus’s rapid spread""https:/…This means personal hygiene should extended here as well. Prevention is better than cure."
"@FrankAB_10Not sure if you read this one. Great article from The Economist Feb 17th.""The coronavirus spreads racism against—and among—ethnic Chinese""https://www.economist.com/china/2020/02/17/t…"
"BillUK ... FrankAB seems to have left 10 days ago (Feb 13th), after 1 (slightly off-colour) post.

"@BillUK32 - Its from my original link, but under a sub heading.https:/…We have a lot of multinationals that work for our company of which some take this time of year to travel back home and see thier family, so we are keeping an eye on the figures."
"Darren, that is superb, thank you for sharing!"
"Traveling in 2 weeks to Dubai with 3 kids aged 9, 11 and 17. I cannot get a refund for any of my hotel or airline bookings or i would have canceled. I watching the news and trying to figure out when to make a call that life and health are more valuable than losing several thousand dollars. other than the transit and airports i think we are just as likely here inthe US to catch Corona as we would be in UAE."
"We are travelling to Dubai from Canada in a couple of weeks as well. Seems that so far the UAE is keeping the virus in check(same number of cases as we have in Canada).Obviously, this virus is getting worse but as long as the cases remain low in the UAE we still plan on going.In the end health is more important than money."
Actually the risk of heavy health damage is higher in the daily traffic than by the virus. It's more a question how to manage the potential situation of being blocked for a while in a hotel or other place.
"Any other updates? I know cycling event has been canceled as two Italian cyclists tested positive for coronavirus. We have a flight next Wednesday, trying to decide to go or not to go.... :)Edited: 10:08 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"As the post above says, the main problem now is the large number of people being quarantined for every infected person, more than the risk of catching the actual virusFor 2 masseuse of the cyclist team (not even cyclists), dozens of people were either quarantined or asked to stay home.In Moscow, their first case led to 80+ people being either hospitalized or quarantined., all because they had some form of contact with the victim, which includes being in the same flight (!)If you do not have small kids or elderly travelers, i would travel, otherwise i would reconsider as the effects of potential quarantine would be worse for them"
"Dubai airport is now scanning all passengers, this from the Khaleej Timeshttps://www.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus-out…"
"It’s a difficult call to make, if people have underlying health problems or are are travelling with young children I can understand the concern. If you’re otherwise fit and healthy I’d see no reason to cancel unless you’re guaranteed a full refund. The UAE have stopped flights to/from Iran and other ‘at risk’ areas. Who knows by next week WHO advice may change and further travel bans may be imposed but at this stage I’d stick to my plans and just exercise good hand hygiene and stock up on anti bacterial wipes for touching things on the plane etc."
We fly out next week and I can not wait. Coronavirus won't stop us unless FOC say it's not safe to go. We will take precautions as we would here. I can not wait to feel some sunshine on me and some warmth :-)
"We fly out tomorrow, cannot wait too."
Bumped for the reasons on other new threads
"I’m having difficulty coming to a conclusion, do I cancel or not? Thanks."
"@ Reet Ghosh, it’s your decision and nobody else’s."
Why would you cancel? If it was a major issue our government would advice against travel & they havnt so go & enjoy yourself
"In fact, the ""panic"" level is rising.Spring Break has essentially been cancelled (having been moved up by 2 weeks with less than 24 hours notice) and university courses have been moved to on-line. It is difficult to imagine that employees could be trifled with in such an off-hand and callous uncaring manner. They would have made travel arrangements months ago.And, no doubt that the next 'happiness' survey will follow shortly."
Are you there now? Anything you can share?
"I fly out tomorrow with my husband to UAE for 9 days. Booked this package since September and couldn’t be more excited. Now this. With a much lower number of cases than US, I actually thought it’s safer there. But my anxiety growing with all these media news and friends advising I cancel. All I wanted is some sun, beach and a great vacation....smhEdited: 2:52 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I still want to go in 2wks can’t wait for some warm Sun ☀️ fed up with all the rain in the UK . Have signed up for Emails from FCO , updates for travel to UAE . They seem to be taking a lot more precautions over there so hopefully all should be OK."
"Just cancelled my trip, their health authority just posted that anyone with any cold like signs, even runny nose, will be held until deemed not sick. Jail? Camp? Not me. Check their health authority posting. Plus my trip insurance probably will not cover cancellation expense."
You have more chance of winning the lottery so seems a shame to cancel to avoid a bad cold but it's your money.Why on earth you think people will be sent to jail for a runny nose is totally beyond me and hope you stay safe or win the lottery.
we have planned vacation in Dubai from 21st March and now this Coronavirus threat.........dont know what to do ??Can anyone guide about how is the situation in Dubai ??
Same question. We are travelling from 12th-18th march.
I’m going also in two weeks to Dubai not cancelling
"Scheduled for Dubai from 13-22 March. Not sure what to do right know, not coming from one of the 10 countries specified but things can change until next Friday and would not want to go through a lengthy screening/testing or even quarantined in the UAE."
keep it in proportion its not huge in europe so hopefully no issues currently.
"I just came back after 7 nights on Wednesday, when I flew I had a cold just a high temp not sneezing, I got pulled out after immigration, a nurse took my temp with an ear thermometer and then she called someone, after about a 5 min wait I was let through and after spending about 2 days not feeling great I was back to normal and enjoyed the rest of my holiday with my family.I wouldn't cancel if you're fit and healthy as Dubai is so clean everywhere I don't think it's even a major issue there."
I have exactly the same concerns. We are flying to Dubai on the 15th for 10 days and although currently UK is not on “high risk” list for incoming passengers anything could change in the next few days.Has anyone landed at Dubai from the UK/Europe in the past couple of days? Are there on the spot medicals and talk of potential isolation? Is anyone flying in this week and could maybe update on what the situation is on landing at DXB? I am also concerned about potential isolation/lockdown/quarantine. Thanks!
"We just arrived to Dubai from Budapest last night, there's a temperature check on the airport, but everything is as usual. We took the bus to Abu Dhabi, few people are wearing masks at bus stations but no sign of panic or isolation. I will kepp you updated."
"#56This link about medical screening at airports in the UAE has been posted a number of times earlier in this and in other UAE forum boards...https://gulfnews.com/uae/health/video-all-pa…We are in the UAE now, and have no worries at all.."
"Glad to read ur post. Please do keep posting further updates, till ur there."
Did u fly out to Dubai as scheduled?
I cancelled my trip.
"I am traveling with a 2 years old baby & parents both above 50 on 19th March.I have decided not to cancel the trip as Dubai is much safer than even India in terms of cleanliness , readiness.Please provide your opinion."
"Thanks for this, I had already seen this article.But this article was published afterwards:https://m.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus-outbr…And seems to suggest ANY symptom from any passenger could mean immediate isolation. Hence my concern, and reason for asking.I appreciate over the past week most passengers have arrived and transitted through Dubai airport safely and easily, but screening seems to change every day, hence me asking if anyone has arrived very recently, or if they are landing there this week maybe they could update this thread.I have ZERO concerns about being in Dubai itself, but I am worried about the screening process on arrival and risk of automatic quarantine/isolation. Which the article above does suggest.Thanks!"
I am also planning on going with my family on 17th March. However with the number of cases in India rising by the day and other Gulf countries stopping flights from India I'm worried the UAE will follow suit.
"Hi Fabida,It will rocket if it mirrors spikes around the world. But i would also add, it seems to be doing worse in hot countries - Hence Dubai night actually be ok"
"I am coming with my family after 10 days, trip is in on.."
Traveling on 19th with infant & Sr.citizen.Still wondering what to do?Fligjts are allowing free rescheduling!
"Unless you know you can handle a situation where potentially your hotel may be locked down and you would be subject to staying stuck for 14 days, i would postpone.This may also apply if someone on your flight is found to have a virus, in which case many people on the same flight will be contacted and asked to quarantineIf the infant and senior citizen are in good shape and not in need of any special medication, then you may be in better position to take the riskRight now, the situation is such that disruptions are not entirely unexpected, Healthy adults are far likelier to be inconvenienced by such disruptionsThis of course does not apply only to Dubai, but most major cities in the world. A Dubai resident planning to visit Singapore would take the same precautions as to whether they can tolerate a disruption"
"A friend and I are planning on holidaying in Dubai for 5 nights in 2 weeks and I am really unsure on what to do as well! The virus itself doesn't concern me but a potential quarantining situation does, especially as that would involve us being in our hotel room for the entire holiday = would be better to stay in the UK! It's so hard to know what decision to make 2 weeks out"
"Under the present world situation, 2 weeks is a long period of time, a lot can change by then, for the better or worseYou can decide 2-3 days before your flight depending on the situation"
"We fly out tomorrow and I am not concerned at all, I am just making sure we take extra medication (prescriptions) to cover an extra 2 weeks just incase we get stuck out there, which I doubt very very much."
Not yet booked (flights or hotel) but looking at going on 21 March for a week. Watching the news and this thread with intrigue. I know its a personal choice but always interested to hear what others are thinking/doing. Desperate for a holiday (who isn't?!) but concerned with potential quarantine more so than the virus itself. My wife and I are slightly disagreeing as to whether to go or not at this stage! We have a 2 year old so 2 weeks in a confined hotel room would be a nightmare!! Good to see Emirates are offering full refunds or changes for flights if booking before 31 March.
"It’s a difficult call to make as FHO advice changes on a daily basis, however it appears for most western countries it’s likely to get worse before it gets better so if you cancel or delay an impending booking then who knows when you’ll next get away.I couldn’t get away Feb half term due to having surgery so my Easter hols can’t come quick enough and unless I’m told otherwise I will not be cancelling but it’s an ever changing situation and the decision may be taken out of my hands. I know it’s business as usual in The UAE at the minute apart from school closures and extra checks at the airport and unlike The UK, folk aren’t half killing each other in the aisles of supermarkets for hand soap and toilet roll. It makes me wonder if anybody actually washed their hands properly before Coronavirus if there’s such a desperate need for hand products now !!"
"So today as 14 more cases have been reported, guidelines seem to have changes again and the UAE are asking for compulsory 14 day isolation for ANYONE coming from Top 10 affected countries:https://gulfnews.com/uae/health/dubai-health…Can anyone confirm if this the case? Does this apply for tourists too? I would say anyone travelling in the next few days should keep an eye on this situation - if UK gets added to the list it surely isn’t worth going for 2 weeks of compulsory quarantine?Can anyone update/advise?Thanks!"
"Hi, we are due to travel end of next week and would appreciate if anyone there currently can confirm if there are any closures in terms of tourist sites?"
As of now there are no tourist sites closed
not closed but concerts are cancelled. For example all concerts in Global Village
"Thank you, much appreciated."
"We are flying out from UK this weekend, will keep you posted."
"I’m due to fly out in a week with BA, and that with my 8 month old baby! Not cancelling, but just keeping a very close eye on advise.Main worry is being quarantined with my baby, but the way things are in the UK, it doesn’t seem much better!"
I am flying out next week am not worried only worry is UK added to Top Affected Countries .
"Can anyone confirm, that if travelling from France or Germany as a tourist, then you will have to self isolate for 14 days?Coz if so, the UK will be at similar Covid 19 figures in 7-10 days and assume will be added to list!"
It’s the risk of quarantine that I’m also super worried about. Can’t seem to get any straight answers anywhere as to whether it is UAE residents or tourists too that face potential compulsory quarantine/isolation. I also think it’ll be safer/cleaner in the UAE than UK but the threat of being on lockdown in a room for 14 days makes me wonder if it’s worth the risk. I just can’t work out what the level of risk actually is....
"It might seem cleaner in UAE, because its all marble and shiny, but at the moment they have more cases of Covid19 per head of population than we have in UK.so much for some on here, that said you have more chance of getting struck by lightening, or winning the lottery. The UAE will go the same way as most countries and have a rapid increase in cases, I just hope its not too soon."
The comment about winning the lottery relates to your chance of dying from Coronavirus.If you are not from China and under 55 you have more chance of winning the lottery than dying of corona virus
@Phil BMy reading is that emirates are only offering refunds/changes if you are coming from an affected country.Due to travel soon with 3 kids under 10 and will be staying in a private family home. So not really so worried as no hotel mixing etc but concerned about the travel and also doing touristy things. Eg... are swimming pools etc safe? Kids are a concern of courseWill be watching develops. I would not even consider making new travel arrangements but flights are booked and paid for
"Latimer (The comment about winning the lottery relates to your chance of dying from Coronavirus.If you are not from China and under 55 you have more chance of winning the lottery than dying of corona virus)Not exactly true now is it?Coronavirus latest news: British woman, 53, dies in Bali after contracting Covid-19?Edited: 6:43 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Yes it is still true. It is statistics and probability.Just because one person under 55 and not from China has died with compromised health and in Bali it doesn't mean the statistic is wrong.You live in Essex where several people have won the lottery - the chance of you winning the lottery is still more than your chance of dying from Corona virus.But you keep making your point if you wish, I'm not going to argue about probability with someone who doesn't get the principle."
"Latimer, You are correct , its pointless arguing over statistics and probability, when people are dying and are scared from the impending doom! Especially with someone, who dosen't understand, that Covid 19 isn't just a bit of flu. Stay Healthy:)"
"I agree, statistics are in most healthy peoples' favour and there is a LOT of media scaremongering, which is why I am desperate to know what the actual situation is in Dubai as of now.I am aware many people flew in last week/over the weekend with no issues, but things are changing on almost an hourly basis, and there are plenty of media reports suggesting automatic quarantine for certain countries, anyone on affected flights etc. I am self employed and have pets at home and so being stuck in Dubai for potentially 3 weeks or more (given our trip is 9 days) is too big a risk for me personally, but I can't get a sense of whether this is likely or not.Has ANYONE arrived into DXB yesterday onwards? What is the situation? Are they being as strict about quarantine as has been reported? Thank you!!"
"@stevieob - its for any new bookings - front page of Emirates website says ""Book by 31 March with zero change fees on all flights"". Plus when you go through to booking, it says this on any ticket option that you select (including the cheapest ""Saver"" fares) - both to cancel and change. Dates on route I was looking at go out to Jan 2021 if anyone wants to take a no monetary risk now that this virus will be under control by then.The 14 days quarantine issue is clearly a real issue and could impact the UK at some point. As others have said, it's very difficult to assess the risk at the moment because everything is moving so quickly"
"Hi, was to travel to dubai on 19th of this month. Decided to postpone the trip due to the present situation. Day after day situation is not getting anything better, stricter screening at airports and also learnt from my friends who are actually at dubai that streets are mostly deserted and there is no much tourists spotted around which shows the amount of caution with which the people are treating it with , hence there is no point of taking the risk along with a 7 yr old kid along and getting stuck for 2 weeks in case of any issue even with one of the other people who would accompany us in the flight/hotel."
"I appreciate any and all updates as well. Leaving in two weeks from the US, and am hoping to travel as planned, but I feel like every day is completely different. I'm ready to pivot and reschedule if needed, but ideally would like to continue on. If the US gets added to the isolation list, obviously that is a non-starter. Also, keeping an eye on if tourist sites shut down, because it is a long way to come and not see everything. Thank you, everyone, who has provided updates. It's really helpful for those who are on the fence and just not ready to make a decision!!"
"@Phil Bunderstand you nowour flights have been booked since last sept, I don't think we qualify for cancelation refunds... or can someone tell me any different?"
We supposed to fly with Emirates on the 2nd of April from the UK with two young children. I have no idea what to do. We could change the date free of charge now or wait and see what happens. At the moment we cant get a refund as no restrictions in place for travel. I doubt things will get better by then but dont want to change the date until a slight chance is there to go.
"We are booked to go on the 6th April. Honestly, I should be excited to go - a trip of a lifetime with my hubby and 3 kids, but I’m seriously worried. I like to think that the media is scaremongering really as more people die of the flu everyday and that doesn’t stop people travelling. I’m just worried Britain will be added to the dreaded list. I’d rather not re-book if it can be avoided."
"People in this thread referenced a list of affected countries whereby a blanket 14 day self isolation would apply.i have looked on the WHO website and can find a list of every country that the virus has spread to, but can't find this list,can someone please link it.... or is it a case that if the virus has hit your country, you will need to isolate?"
"recent news from Emirates, they will now allow changes on older bookings and not just new bookings.it says one change and a window of 11 months from original travel date.nothing about refunds and i think you might have to pay more if there is a fare difference!https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/travel/…"
"Actually some information here on flights and testing.nothing about blanks self isolation rules though, if anyone knows more about that pleasehttps:/…latest-update-on-flight-suspensions-2"
"Hi All, I am so in two minds and I think its going to effect my holiday. I fly out Friday 13/3/2020. I am hopefull all will go well. I am going with Family t wo childrens 1 and 5 year old from Gatwick UK."
"Well. The European-US flight ban just canceled out my Dubai trip (coming home via Amsterdam), so the decision just got made for me after all. I’m very disappointed but I will try to reschedule."
"I think the travel ban from Europe to the U.S. does not apply to U. S. citizens. I thought my Dubai trip would be canceled, too because we are going through Switzerland. I have to make phone calls to the travel agent tomorrow to confirm. There is a chance my flight back to the U.S. could be canceled though."
"I had a feeling something like this was going to happen, not often I agree with Trump but perhaps the right thing to do and I think The UK and indeed everywhere else should follow suit to contain it as it’s clearly getting worse before it gets better.I understand it’s really disappointing for anyone due to travel but with the ever changing advice and the fact many countries tend to follow suit on US advice, I think delaying an imminent holiday may be for the best as I think we’ll see more flights ceasing to operate from many destinations on a temporary basis in the coming days. I don’t think you can enjoy a holiday fully with the worry you’ll not be able to get back. I’m due to travel to Dubai next in April, still 5 weeks away so it’s most likely to change again but I’ll just watch this space.Edited: 11:49 pm, March 11, 2020 "
According to the news US citizens can still fly back into The US from Europe but may face quarantine so in line with that may be best to delay. Oddly enough the travel ban doesn’t ( yet) include flights from The UK despite The UK having significantly higher numbers of confirmed Coronavirus than some of The European countries which are on the travel ban. I assume that’s a political move. Trumps speech did make me laugh as it suggests it’s now a European problem and The EU are responsible for affecting Americans... that man has no limits
We are due to fly from UK to Dubai on 23rd March and hoping to go. Watching all announcements daily. So from this post looks like we can change Emirates flights to next year but we did book non refundable flights ages ago but presume this is OK? However not sure what hotel Park Hyatt will do as booking (4 people) was a non-refundable rate. Assume if UK added to hot list then we could claim on insurance? Don't want to arrive and be isolated in hotel room for the holiday! What about if you paid hotel on credit card - will they refund if UK gets added to hot list? Any info on above much appreciated.
"Hey everyone,We’re also due to fly to Dubai on 31st March, like many at first I wasn’t phased at all but now I’m just hoping for the best and that we still get to go. Is anyone in Dubai at the moment? Is it business as usual or a significant decrease in people at tourist attractions? My suitcase is half packed lol but now I’m coming to terms with the possibility of flights ceasing etc hopefully it will be fine, I’m keeping a close on eye on updates as most people will be"
"Hi Amelia,I think you'll be ok in Dubai. The bigger risk is travelling from Dubai to an affected place where you might get stuck in quarantine somewhere you really dont want to be.Good luckBill"
"We arrived in Dubai this morning, the plane was pretty full, for some reason the plane parked miles away & we had to bus it to the terminal. No probs on there, immigration was a little slow & the thermal imaging was very discreet. We then went to the Mall after we checked into our apartment & it was very quiet, even at lunchtime. My friends got some very good deals on jewellery. Everything seems fine, a few people are wearing masks but not many.  I’ll keep you posted"
"Hi Nicola, with cases rising by 11 today to 85, take extra care."
"Hi, I’ve been following this post for a while and also keeping an eye on foreign office advice daily. I’m feeling quite stressed about it all but currently plan to travel on Monday to Dubai as planned. My concern, like others, is getting stuck away from home, poorly or in quarantine. We are a travelling family of 4 with 2 healthy but young children. If it was just me and my husband I’d be far less worried (perhaps!) We booked our flight and hotel both through Emirates, I have spoken to them directly as we would be allowed to change flights but not hotel without financial penalty. Obviously safety is more important than money but it’s hard to determine the true level of risk...If we do get out there and make it back ok I’ll be happy to post an update!Edited: 11:32 am, March 12, 2020 "
Hi Nikola it's good to hear of someone who is out there now. Would you be able to give us an update on if any attractions are closed? I am flying out on the 19th and am in two minds whether to change date for later in the year. Have a great trip!
"We got home last night from a 10 night stay and had no real concerns about the virus at all. The Government are implementing widespread hygiene enhancement practices in many aspects of the country.Additional cleaning and disinfections are being carried out in the airports, malls, attractions, hotels, offices, shops etc.The mechanism of infection is by droplets, either sneezed or coughed over people, but the virus can survive on hard surfaces, so good hand hygiene is your first line of defence. The Gulf News, a local newspaper has rolling updates on the situation in the UAE.. here’s a link to it if it helps. https://gulfnews.com/We are due back in Dubai for 16 nights at the end of May and are very much looking forward to it..Edited: 12:02 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Thevikingguy yes of course I’ll keep updating if anything changes, JBR still seems busy & Global Village is apparently still open, if I hear more I’ll pass it on"
"A big thanks to everyone on providing onsite updatesI have a trip in late May to Dubai for a few days and then onwards to Hanoi (Vietnam). That portion seems to be more in jeopardy so I may stay in Dubai and return back to the UK, assuming things don't get much worse."
"I arrived to Dubai from London two days ago. I feel much safer here than London (fewer people, more spacious, more room.) It feels like people here are taking the virus situation seriously and using hand sanitizers all the time. A couple of restaurants I have eaten have even brought hand sanitizers to our table. Unlike London, the pharmacies are not sold out of them either. I’m here with my family, including a 4 month-year-old. Lots of families here enjoying themselves. I’m staying in the Marina area and not seeing much of the sites, just enjoying the pool and beach. I made the calculation that if I did have to stay another 2 two weeks then that would be ok.Edited: 2:57 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Also thanks everyone who are giving updates I fly out on 18th March
"I also fly on 18th so am reading this thread with great interest - thanks for the updatesEdited: 3:18 pm, March 12, 2020 "
I am due to fly out on the 16th.. thanks everyone for the updates it is really helpful and I am continuing to check this thread.
Thank you all for the updates. It’s both reassuring and really helpful. I’m still hopeful we will get to fly out on the 31st so keeping the suitcase packed and keeping a close eye on this thread :)
"I have been keeping an eye daily on all OFFICIAL sites as we go on the 23rd. Regarding a previous post about anyone arriving from an affected country on the list being told to isolate for 14 days - I can only find mentioned that UAE citizens and residents being asked to do this and that isolation means not going to work/school - no mention of this being the case with tourists. If you go to Dubai Airport website, scroll to the bottom and click on ALERT it just states that every arrival will go through thermal scanning and that anyone on their list will be scanned twice (thermal + nasel swab) and there are NO European countries on the list. This info was updated this morning so at the current time I think there is a lot of misinformation flying around. Of course things may change but we are hoping to go and feel we would be safer in Dubai than the UK as they seem far more prepared for this than here."
Italy is the only European country currently on the list
I think we are going to reschedule and probably wait till Christmas to go
"Thumbs up to all with the updates, due on the 8th of April for shopping mainly. Hope the Dubai mall & mall of Emirates is open?Not an essential holiday but the kids are all excited & have planned for quite sometime but flights & hotel is cancellable without penalty, DO YOU THINK I SHOULD POSTPONE AS WITH 3 kids???"
"8th April is a long way away considering how much is changing every dayAs of now all malls are open and fewer residents going vs normal times, so they are relatively quiet, and there are also less tourists than usualEdited: 5:16 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"We travel 28th march to the palm atlantis from the uk. Still don't know what to do. Is it busy there??Edited: 5:20 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Yeah due to the changes happening every day especially here in UK no one knows what situation will be like come April. Emirates has list of suspended flights and they so far got US Asia Italy Iran on there.Edited: 6:42 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"I am also going to Dubai on the 31st March with three very kids under 6. I am going for 16nighrs and was sooo looking forward to going . Now I feel like I am under so much pressure . Should I go ? We are staying on jbr and I have heard this place is deserted . Is that true ? Can someone please tell me if places are still busy , are people still going . I’m scared my 5 year old and 3 year old would want to go touch everything there no matter how much I try to keep them From touching stuff . And I want to take them to city walk area where there are play centres and also water parks , will I not be able to ?"
"That's more than 2 weeks away.Yes, most places are much quieter than normalBut everything is open, and functioningIts a psychological thing, if you are constantly worried about your kids, then even if theres not much risk you will be constantly worried and have a bad vacation. If I were you, I would decide 4 or 5 days before the flight whether to go or not depending on how you are feeling then"
This thread ia very helpful- thank you in advance. I know the situation keeps changing. My concern is going to the hotel and not many people being there. Is that the case? Will kids clubs Pools activities etc still be going ahead?
"Tourist attractions and malls are still working an open as usual, although some people have taken precautionary measures to stay away from crowded places. As mentioned, the authorities are taking the situation very seriously and have taken decision to prevent the spread of the virus. Yesterday, a ban on shisha in all cafe, restaurants and hotels for 2 weeks went into effect. Schools and universities are out for one month since last week (2 weeks mid term holiday and 2 weeks online home study). Overall, people are more careful now. At work you notice less people shake hands, more sanitizing devices are placed all over. At restaurants, malls, etc you have free hand sanitizers to clean your hands. In short, there is no panic and everything is open but you notice few people wearing masks."
"I'm flying to Dubai on Monday 16th March, but my parents are very very paranoid. How is the situation in the airport? Is it really bad??"
"Leeroy There is nothing “ bad” at the airports...The airports are thermal screening all arriving passengers, and anyone with signs indicative of a fever is being additionally tested by a nasal swab or mouth swab.The smart gates at DXB and DWC have been suspended but other than that, everything is functioning as normal."
FiyazIsmath - Yes.
"Well I am just about to cancel my trip, which was scheduled for 31st March. Due to the fact that the UK government has admitted they cannot contain the virus and the fact that they estimate that up to 10,000 people in the UK may already have it and be unaware of the same I expect many countries to exclude UK visitors.This is the list as of 14.30pm today (13.03.20) India (until 15 April), Benin, Cyprus, Gabon, El Salvador, the Federated States of Micronesia in the Pacific, Kuwait, North Korea, Philippines, Slovakia ,Vietnam and the Pacific island of Kiribati. There is a high risk that British nationals may be put into a 14-day quarantine while the authorities impose travel restrictions.Trump will soon have more than enough issues to deal with, especially if he continues to allow UK flights (politics or not) and then he can come on TV in a Keep America Great hat to talk about how ""tremendous"" the USA's testing facilities are (they're not) and how ""he's seen the testing packs and they're beautiful"" - deluded and barking, inappropriate responses to any off script topic as per.I get that some folk have just come home and that some folk are there now with no issues BUT the next two weeks will see unprecedented levels of flight restrictions and self isolation.I've decided to cancel because I don't want to unwittingly spread anything and I have an 85 year old mum at home.I've said a lot on this topic up to now including stats and probability and urging ""no panic"" and I maintain that position, however, we all have to do our part to halt the spread and frankly whether or not Wild Wadi is open is irrelevant compared to the fact that I fully expect more countries to prevent UK citizens from travelling because we have admitted we can't contain it and in fact we'd like people to get it to create a herd community in the UK.For the people that are hanging on or undecided then that is entirely up to them - this was only ever a decision that an individual could take regardless of how many forum posts there are."
"I am traveling to Dubai tomorrow (Saturday) from India.I have Slight cough and cold.Even though I don't have Corona virus, will I be quarantined or will they just test me and allow us to go after testing in a few hours."
I booked a last minute flight the other night to go on the 24th of March - however I have a sneaky feeling things are going to go pear shaped before then and I wont be able to go.. not too worried about it getting cancelled to be fair as I am returning with the family at the end of May.. even that may change too..
"Latimer ... I have not always agreed with you in the past, but in fact I did agree with you as regards the 'no panic' business. I myself had a trip to Singapore scheduled. I would still go, if I could. At least, I would have a few days ago. Today, with the ever increasing number of flight restrictions, etc, and Singapore now saying that they will not cover the cost of those who are deemed infected (whether or not it occurred in Singapore) it gives a person pause. My health insurance (issued, as it is, in the UAE) would be a 'wild card.'A week ago, Spring Break was moved up by 2 weeks here in a knee jerk reaction that is now touted as a stroke of genius. Voices of reason concerning how many contracted the flu (and died) in the same period go unheard. That the flu targets older people (also) as it's main victims is irrelevant. Shisha has been banned (in principle only, as I walked past Piccolo Mondo Cafe along SZR tonight (from the (tonight empty) pub I frequent) and people were puffing away.) But who knows what will go sideways next.You have simply to genuflect to the hysteria. There is nothing else you can do. And if you don't, you run the risk of something being imposed upon you by the righteous, the 'all knowing' and by those who post links to CoVid 19 updates, and who have just discovered the word 'pandemic' ..."
An interesting read; maybe we should hear from some who have had this deadly virus ...https:/…
"Check out the comments on the article of the link in #140. Here's a preview:""While it certainly needs to be taken seriously and all the appropriate measures put in place, this is hardly the Black Death or Spanish flu.And absolutely this is being used as a political weapon to bash Orange Man Bad. When it was the swine flu under Obama 2009 (which killed something like 12,000 or more Americans, many children) the coverage was far more muted and there certainly wasn't a barrage of hysterical 'journalists' and Republicans trying to pin all the blame on the President.Indeed, while screening and flight restrictions were being put in place back in January, most Democrats and 'journalists' were still salivating over the idiotic sham impeachment trial.I wish I could say I was surprised."""
Here it comes ...https://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/corona…
"I agree with Cookie, but when I look around me, and in social media, a lot of people have turned to panic after being indifferent. And now people like me who bring up swine flu numbers to show how much worse that was are termed irresponsible and selfish. The latest woke thing is to paste that graph about ""flattening"" the infection curve, and say that we need to get into lockdowns to avoid overwhelming the health system.....Everyone seems to be pointing to ""Experts"" including Dr. Fauci, who are ringing the doom bell, and some experts are predicting 5 million deaths, while others hold on to a 3.4% death rate, ignoring that many people have not been tested and which would bring down the fatality rate"
"I am due to travel on 27th, i booked with an agency travel trolley, as emirates has advised there is no charge to change the dates only pay fare difference, travel trolley has said i would still need to pay airline tax again? Is there anyway around this as they have quoted me £500 airline tax for 2 adulta and 1 child under 2"
"Absolute nonsense , Airport taxes are only paid once and would only change if you moved from Economy to Business. In fact if you have to cancel the flight the taxes paid are refunded. Either the agency is giving you false information or you are misunderstanding the problem"
"HiWe are due to travel on the 23 rd MarchWe are desperate to go on holiday and as such are thinking of bringing it forwardIt’s the thought of being tested for virus on arrival and being quarantined that’s a worryWhat actually happens at the airport and, if you have the virus, where do you get put(quarantined)"
"Not sure what Dubai will do but Abu Dhabi just issued this statement:In line with precautionary measures to ensure the health and safety of visitors, AbuDhabi’s main tourist attractions, theme parks & cultural destination will be temporarily closed from 15 to 31 March to limit large gatherings and protect public health in response to COVID-19https://gulfnews.com/uae/coronavirus-uae-abu…"
I feel dubai will follow. I'm accepting that our holiday from 28th March isn't going to happen. I heard that you are screened on way out of the airport. If you show signs of temperature etc then further tests
I also heard from people i know in dubai that dubai will likely go into lockdown for 4 weeks soon
"Bph12See post #3 in this forum thread...https:/…106023138The only people who know whether the emirate is likely to go into lockdown, at any time, are MOHAP staff, and they certainly won’t be sharing that information informally with UAE residents... The decision, if it is made, will be announced formally and through official channels, after approval by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al Maktoum , the ruler of Dubai and his ruling Council of advisers.I would suggest you recommend to your friends in Dubai that they stop spreading speculation and scaremongering, because they will get into trouble for doing so...https://www.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus-out…"
I’ve just read post 3 as per linkWhat actually happens if the swab is positive for virus
"Hi Steeevo - we are also going out on the 23rd for 10 days. I follow all the official sites and as of today UK flights not affected. You will go through thermal screening at airport and only if you show a fever/high temperature will you have to have a nasal swab. We are not worrying at this stage - OK Dubai will be quieter than usual (good thing) and they may well shut down large attractions like Global Village etc but I cannot see restaurants/hotels closing. We have non refundable flights with Emirates from Birm, - if Emirates cancels flight before we go/UAE stops UK flights we will get a refund as other countries currently in that position. Our hotel has said we can move our reservation to same dates 2021 if that happens. Don't worry, just go have a great time and just follow precautions re. hand washing etc. If by chance you have a cold/fever you may have to have a Covid test but if healthy no problem (currently). By the way anyone (like us) who bought World Cup tickets - they are refunding to card you paid on within 6-8 weeks - had E Mail this morning."
Thanks wotsist. I dont believe everything i hear unless it's via authorities. Anyone in dubai at the moment? How are things?
"Totally agree with Wotsit!! Don't listen to rumours, just follow official sites - uk gov, dubai airport alert, uae gov, flight company etc"
"This may be worth noting, although it's only just broken and may (or may not) be refined with more information later.https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/uae-susp…"
"Bph12 I am here now & it is quiet, the Dubai frame was quieter than normal. To be honest apart from some wearing masks & less tourists it all seems fine"
"This has just broken from Dubai Media Office"" In line with ongoing efforts to safeguard public health, the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing directs that all events in #Dubai should be suspended from Sunday 15 March 2020 till the end of the month.DTCM also directs all entertainment destinations to suspend operations and all hospitality establishments and wedding halls to suspend wedding gatherings from Sunday 15 March 2020 till the end of the month. Inspections will be carried out to verify compliance with this circular."""""
"@Shaun C #155 we have just seen that too. This part of the article is interesting: “The authority added that the decision will be effective until countries of departure activate a mechanism for medical screening of passengers as an additional measure.” I wonder how long they anticipate to have this restriction in place. It seems a relatively simple ‘solution’ to test prior to departure but I suppose it’s all still a waiting game. We visit Dubai regularly, due back in Aug but also due to fly out to Mauritius via Dubai with emirates for 2 weeks on 4th April."
Has everyone seen the news about the visas not being issued?
Louise B #159 yes see below - a link was posted a couple of posts ago for those who haven’t seen it. Hoping it is just a temporary thing for a few weeks max!
Oh i missed that one. Not sure where we stand now. We go Wednesday. Can you get a visa from UK before arrival?
HiDon't think any visitors can go from Monday they are not issueing and visitor's visas.
HiNo visitor's visas being issued from next week.Nobody can go
"Hi, apologies if this is a stupid question but links say the visas will stop being issued from 17th. What about people who are due to arrive on the 16th (us!)?!"
There’s no confirmation yet of no visitor visas being issued. Please stop spreading fake news. We are all awaiting proper confirmation.
"It is all very confusing atm in terms of no real clarity or transparency. We’re due to fly on the 31st March however with the visa ban we have no idea if that’s now going to be the case (most likely not) because it doesn’t clarify how long they’ve stopped issuing for? @Hannah - it’s not a silly question, I’d be the exact same as it does say from the 17th but if you’re due to fly out on the 16th then you may possibly get one? Perhaps confirm with the airline/booking agent? The FCO should ideally update as soon as these announcements come to light in the country of origin I have half packed but now I’m considering unpacking lol such a dilemma I just hope we all get a straight answer soon Amelia x"
Please see my post at 23 on this topic.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g295…I won't be commenting on this type of topic againI hope everyone stays safe and well
"Oh no just finished packing 2 suitcases, due to fly out 18th March so defo no Visitors Visas ?????"
"The only visas that will be issued are diplomatic ones. So unless you throw parties with Ferrero Rochers and spoil guests (pop culture reference - 80s advert) it's 99.9% certain you won't be allowed to board.Now, this is only guesswork, but I'd say your flight would have to be landing into Dubai a couple of hours before midnight on the 16th just to be sure (depending on how strict they are).As for this jiggery-pokery about trying to apply for an e-visa now in the hope it will be issued beforehand - you can try, but it's likely to be a waste of time, money and energy.As for how long the suspension is likely to take, it's anyone's guess. I wouldn't think UK airports would implement a system the UAE would be happy with any time soon (even if there was a political will to do so).Edited: 1:44 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Hi shaun , should I just wait for BA to contact me ?"
"When are you due to depart Maggie? I'd expect BA to have an announcement on this within 24 hours, so maybe by tomorrow lunch (UK time).It's a fine line sometimes as the dust needs to settle, companies to think about their policies and then get the PRs to write emails etc.I don't think it's a coincidence that the UAE decided to make all these 3 major announcements on the local weekend. It should give travel providers a bit of time to get their ducks in a row.Edited: 1:54 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Thank you , Monday evening . On BA site you can request a voucher to rebook but I'm not sure if its working properly as they have complaints on Twitter ."
"IF your contact details are correct on your booking, they'll likely email you to advise.However, IF that advice is only the same as what's on their main CV pages it may mean you've lost a bit of time in submission. My guess is, like most of the 'tinternet and contact centres for travel companies at present, they're maybe overwhelmed.With that said, you are travelling within 72 so you're allowed to message them as per their pinned Tweet. I'd suggest sending them a tweet and asking them to follow you so they can DM you. Put in the tweet you're looking for help as due to fly to Dubai within 72 hours and they should be able to chat with you (fingers crossed)"
Thank you again Shaun .
@Sarah F #165 what makes you think this is fake news?? I wouldn’t expect Gulf News to report if this was the case...
"Never mind Gulf News, Khaleej Times it hardly gets more official than Emirates News Agency.This is the original post that all subsequent media has reported from >>>http://www.wam.ae/en/details/1395302830665"
"Also re post #165What part of ‘all’ visas, implies that it doesn’t include tourist visas?Edited: 3:16 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Sarah in #165.See the link to the official UAE news agency portal in #177. Nobody here is spreading “ fake news”..Members have previously posted authenticated links to a number of UAE media / newspaper websites, which obtain the FACTS from the official Emirates News Agency, and perhaps if you had read any of them you wouldn’t accuse members of posting untruths.In an effort to assist you, here’s a link to the information posted in #177..http://www.wam.ae/en/details/1395302830665"
"Going a tiny bit off topic, does anyone know this - we have a annual worldwide Gold cover family insurance policy with a relatively well known insurer. This is due for renewal in June. This would therefore cover us for our (supposedly) upcoming trip in April, but we also have a Dubai trip booked for August. This obviously won’t be covered by the current year but we can’t currently renew the existing policy because it’s too far away. Does anyone know what happens in this situation if we booked it before this was all an issue (last Oct)? Thanks"
"I will do my best BUT this is a time for individual circumstances and individual solutions.I work at a senior level in the insurance industry in the UK so have access to latest information and guidelines for most insurers and from the advisory bodiesMost insurers will have or will shortly publish on their website or send you an email their approach - if you want to send me a PM with the name of the insurer I may be able to help further.So in general terms (and please note not all insurers will follow general terms), Corona virus is now what is classified as a known event, this means that for policies taken out after an event is known i.e. your renewal date in June issues arising from Corona virus will not be covered such as medical bills or hospital costs.However, the cancellation element of your cover applied at the time you bought the holiday (Oct) and as far as I am able to I would reasonably argue that if your August holiday is cancelled due to an insured event then cover is applicable on your old policy because Corona Virus was not known about when you booked that trip.This of course is a somewhat moot point because as we have all experienced this past week it is not people that are cancelling, their holidays are being cancelled left, right and centre for reasons that are beyond their control and the airlines or holiday companies are liable.Please also note that ALL prudent airlines and ALL prudent hotels will have huge insurance policies too - that cover them for all sorts of things normally classed as business interruption.Hope that helps a bit."
"Just had Email from FCO with up date Visas will no longer be issued on arrival. If you do have a Visas issued before 17th March you should be allowed to travel, visitors will be tested on arrival and be required to self-isolate for 4 days , its not clear whether these changes apply to all visitors or those coming from a specific risk-based list of countries .Edited: 8:38 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"The situation here in Dubai has changed significantly over the last 24hrs :-( As you are aware all tourist attractions are closing, night clubs closing and no visas issued from 17th March. I am here now & up until yesterday it was all going well, I here with 3 girlfriends at the moment. They are flying home on Tuesday morning (17th) my husband, dad & friend are meant to be coming out overnight on 16th, arriving on 17th, however it is now very doubtful that they will be able to come due to the visa restrictions, so I will be here rattling around in this huge (absolutely beautiful) apartment until I fly home on 22nd, unless I can get on an earlier flight home??? My poor husband has been trying to speak to Emirates all night to no avail. The situation is changing very rapidly"
"Thanks to all for keeping us informed with updates. This from the FCO. this morning `5/3/20 (below)As discussed No new visa's on arrival, if you have them issued before this date, it looks like you will have to isolate for 4 days! CoronavirusThe UAE authorities have introduced a number of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) within the UAE.You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities. This could include enhanced medical screening on arrival, with the potential for further follow-up health measures and restrictions. You should be aware that public health measures and restrictions in the UAE may change quickly and may be significant.The UAE has announced new restrictions on issuing of visas. We understand that from 17 March, the UAE will temporarily suspend the issuance of all visas, with the exception of diplomatic passport holders. Visas will no longer be issued on arrival although those who have a visa issued before that date should be allowed to travel; visitors will be tested on arrival and be required to self-isolate for 4 days. It is not currently clear whether these changes apply to all visitors or those coming from a specific risk-based list of countries.Some routes to and from the United Arab Emirates by air, land and sea have been suspended. You should check with your travel provider before travelling.We understand that passenger cruises are currently not allowed to dock in the UAE as a result of measures taken to combat coronavirus The Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) has adopted an enhanced member health policy which all CLIA ocean member cruise lines are required to follow to address the coronavirus. If you are planning to travel on an international cruise that is due to call at any port in the UAE, contact your travel company for the latest information.UAE Citizens and Residents have been advised by the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention not to travel abroad and that those who travel may face preventative measures on their return to the UAE. Returning residents will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. It is not currently clear whether these changes apply to all returning residents or those coming from a specific risk-based list of countries.The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHaP) have called on all senior members of the public to remain at home and steer away from crowded places.All schools in the UAE have been closed for four weeks from Sunday 8 March 2020.Many events have been cancelled in the UAE in the coming weeks and months. Abu Dhabi’s main tourist attractions, theme parks and cultural destination will be closed from Sunday 15 March until the end of the month. If you are planning to attend a specific event in the UAE, please check with the organisers before travelling."
Hello. We’re due to fly out tomorrow morning(16th) on Emirates and land in Dubai at 8:30pm. Returning a week later. None of this news is on bbc so we only found out here! Now we don’t know if it’s worth it to go or not if we have to self isolate for 4 days and all the attractions are closed. Does anyone know if I can get a refund? Thanks.
"Hi Sera, we are in same situation. Due to arrive in Dubai from Manchester U.K. on 16th. I’m inclined to cancel but not sure how this affects our rights as visa issue applied from the 17th.The idea of going straight into self isolation is not very appealing!!"
We booked through an agent so I’m trying to see if I can get a refund or rebook. Emirates and the hotel have said we can rebook but I would like the option of a refund first. The FCO haven’t said not to go which is a huge bummer for so many travellers to so many countries as it doesn’t validate their insurances. This is becoming a pain!
Good luck. I would like the option for a refund of to rebook. At the moment I can’t get hold of anyone at Emirates holidays to get clarity on what to do. I appreciate they will be inundated. Hoping to get guidance soon...
That’s the bit I don’t understand The FCO haven’t said not to go but you can’t physically go if you hold a British passport
Someone has just said UK passports can still go and get a visa on arrival. It doesn't make sense. Hope something official comes out soon.
"I am here in Dubai at the moment. Nightclubs, big events, etc have closed but hotels, restaurants and beaches, clubs are still open. Malls are still open. Still looks pretty normal out there."
"The FCO will not say don't go. Just as they didn't when India restricted visa issuance a few days ago.The FCO will say not to go to a country usually for safety/security or other reasons. A visa restriction/suspension is a completely separate matter and they will just advise of that situation, not to travel.To be clear, the FCO does not have UAE as a ""do not travel"" listed country.UK passport holders can get a visa on arrival, but not from 17th onwards, and there is a compulsory 4 day period of self-isolation on entry."
Update for UK passengers https:/…latest-covid-19-update-15-3
Does anyone know when official sources will tell us we can’t fly to Dubai after 17th March? They were soon to tell us about flights to Spain and USA? It’s slightly different as they’re not advising no travel but if you can’t get a visa on arrival then basically it’s the same? I
"This is bloody crazy, it’s now saying UK passport holders can still go?? Or am I reading it wrong?? Xxx"
"Jools - they won't, and it's not basically the same as it has different implications and outcomes.Many agents won't actively rebook or listen to complaints/requests until FCO says it's a no-go country.FCO won't say don't go to a country if it restricts visas, it will just advise you.As it stands - and this is only single-source (ie Dubai Airports) but it now looks like they will issue visas to UK (and other countries) travellers. It seems that overnight, they've decided to implement a four-day self-isolation rather.However, I can't stress enough this is why it's worth looking across different reputable sources - as even they can't always keep a uniform message. As it stands the FCO advice, the Emirates News Agency and Dubai Airports have slightly different messages being relayed.Edited: 8:00 am, March 15, 2020 "
There Is no one answering any calls .
has anyone who is still intent on going thought about the risks of quarantine and costs if not covered by insurance?
"We’ve been lucky and we have managed to cancel and get a refund and for our hotel, and credit for our flights to be used within a year of booking. We decided not to risk it as my companions are in the high at risk categories. Seems like people are understanding which is nice. Just gotta keep trying to get through!"
"Hi Sera, that’s great news. I’m really hoping we will get the same but who knows. I managed to get through to Emirates holidays and they have promised to call me back with an update on our options before our flight tomorrow morning. The issue is over the hotel, the flights can be changed. As appealing as it is to go, I’m feeling increasingly stressed about the prospect of going into self isolation, quarantine, etc with young children."
"Hannah, I completely understand your reservations. It’s not a holiday if you’ll be worrying constantly the entire time you’re there. You’re travelling with young children which means having to keep them happy and entertained too. I really hope Emirates can either refund, rebook, or credit you. Everyone deserves a peaceful holiday!"
Apparently The ban on visas does NOT include those who get free visa upon arrival https:/…latest-covid-19-update-15-3
I'm in Dubai until Tuesday. Our hotel spa and gym were shut today until further notice. I suspect all hotels now have the same restrictions. The pool is still open.
"On the wagon, off the wagon - but it seems better news.FCO have changed their advice from ""required to self-isolate for 4 days"" to may be tested and required to self-isolate. Screenshot >> https://d.pr/i/T0Jz8YLink >>> https:/…coronavirus"
"Regardless of whether people will be granted entry, personally I’d be reluctant to travel to The UAE or anywhere at the minute, with the risk of quarantine, self isolation and lack of amenities which is including pools I’m slightly in disbelief that folk are still willing to travel. It’s each to their own and I do understand the financial implications if people cancel and lose money but I can’t see how anybody can go on holiday at the minute and not have constant worry. For those still opting to go I hope it’s still possible to have a good holiday giving the ever increasing restrictions."
"so you would lose mid march when its not that hot and a pool is really not needed as it is yet to get to hot oppressive temps , several thousand pound on the basis of being unsure . we have spent all day getting people to take trips because they cant afford those loses as they are going in the morning - not next week . last infor and people boarding says it ok , of course it might change , so what would be the preferred option for a family of 4 saying spent 5 k lose all their money and sit in miserable england thinking what if and not getting any thing back as their agent is closed and they are due to travel at 8.30 am in the morning and a no show would lose any money back or change . OR think go and have some quality time if not all be it . If they had options of 24 hrs we have told them to pursue the agents , this long length of post is about those travelling today and tommorow morning.Edited: 5:10 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"the restrictions have been lifted , its was all hot air yesterday as it is tonight all good for the uk . the rest is just scare mongering. since yesterday it has changed on the hour."
"Love dogs, are you a travel agent?If so, can you confirm if rebooking is an option or not in some hotels or are you just insisting everyone has to travel?"
"im not a agent - this thread has been about luke and hannah travelling today and tomorrow morning - the FCO has said we are not self isolating as it stands for uk on arrival - Luke reported that at 6pm on his check in with emirates. Neither of those two were able to change or refund because the agents were impossible to get through to and the agents didnt contact them either .There are so many threads - you created this one and this is the one we have advised on based on today information before hours of operation tomorrow . the lady due to travel from Manchester will be sat on the plane prob at 7.30 am for her flight tomorrow - her agent has not responded , she has been on all day to them which is emirates travel - if we tell people to not show up they will lose their full money."
"there are 7 different threads going - admin close all down and keep one open so at least we can read and be sure what is current.Travel bear i thought i was on your last thread . clearly i wasnt - to many - to much information and to confusing we need one and one only threadEdited: 5:28 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Ah, apologies, when you said, ‘we have spent all day getting people to take trips’ I thought that was in a professional capacity"
"no one is insisting people go , where time is allowed get information and make a informed choice on the facts and offers from their agent . you were responding to many as well with the same information about those travelling today and tommorow not thursday not next week or next month.one thread please ."
"Lovedogs in #213If you would like a TA Moderator to close threads and/or amalgamate them all into one, you need to contact TA via the General Support Help Centre.It’s unlikely they will agree however, because they have declined to do so in many other forum boards, the Air Travel one being a prime example.Kind regards"
"cheers wotsit - maybe the DE can sort it out its to confusing for travelers for limited time to make informed options , im out now , brain is frazzled .what a flaming state of affairs this travel business in in today globally - ive family in florida - no that is another story."

"Hi all, with all the changes happening since yesterday and Abu Dhabi announcing shutting down attractions we thought Dubai would be on its way in doing the same. We were due to travel today evening with BA and were on the phone to BA early this morning about our options, luckily just before my call their policy had changed and they advised that I can get a voucher which would include my flight and hotel booking (we booked a package via them) . Therefore we just went ahead and did this. Just a note to those who will be staying at Atlantis like we would have been, they just announced a few hours ago today they will be shutting down their aqua venture park and other attractions until end March via twitter and ond their website. I also called them several times this morning about whether everything is open and they said yes , and 5/6 hours later they announce this. Just letting anyone out there who is going to stay with them to be aware of this"
"Nobody on this forum DE or otherwise is qualified to tell people what to do, this is an unprecedented occurrence and so fast moving. Only last week I was quite happily prepared to go to Dubai in three weeks, I have since changed my mind. I have a permanent residency visa so together with the fact I have lots of family in The UAE am l luckier than most in that I could stay elsewhere I’m not governed by hotel restrictions however I don’t think it’s the right thing to travel at the minute, as well as the uncertainty of what is/isn’t open and other restrictions there’s a higher risk when travelling of contracting the virus but equally as important I don’t think it’s fair to put others at increased risk and given our governments lax approach if I was resident of another country I wouldn’t want anybody from The UK coming into contact with me. Yes I would rather lose money than put my child at a higher risk than necessary but that’s just me. I’m not saying my opinion is right as it’s just that, an opinion, people could travel tomorrow and have a right good time but equally could travel and have a holiday disaster but this is about more than just getting away on holiday it’s about staying safe and looking out for those around you. The airlines, governments, FCO and travel industry need to be singing off the same hymn sheet as clearly at the minute they’re not and it’s leaving many people in an impossible situation."
"Well said Hannah , completely agree ."
Anyone tried to change flights from Emirates online? I booked mine back in early February so should be eligible for no fee to change but if you try change online it still has fees added.
Don't get a visa or get a visa 24 hours later - methinks that there is far too much politics mixed up in all of this whilst ordinary people try to juggle things and make impossible decisions.I see the FCO has advised against all but essential travel to the USA - pouty lip and tit for tat following the extension of their ban on the UK. But at least all the folk that were heading there get cover on insurance now.How any airline or hotel chain can refuse to re-book (providing you can get through) any customer that is heading to a place with a 4 day self isolation period and no cover for hospital treatment if required plus no facilities is beyond me.All of these outfits pride themselves on their customer service standards until they are against the wire.I agree totally with Hannah and I have cancelled my trip - I will get a voucher for the flights and hotels have agreed to re-book.
"Latimer I don’t think the 4 day self isolation is correct - I believe it was a possibility but now it has been removed. The issue is the insurance and holiday companies. We’ve got 2 packages booked - one through Destination2 for Mauritius (via Dubai with a stopover on return) in the upcoming Easter holidays and another to Dubai in August with Emirates Holidays. If they stand firm on the refund policy and only permit refunds where FCO advises against all but essential travel we stand to lose £14k if we don’t go. So for many, the choice is either lose your money or go and risk being put in self isolation if you have a temp/any symptoms on arrival (which lets face it kids always have a cough/cold/temp). For us there’s also the risk that we won’t be insured at all for the second trip as our annual policy expires before that one even though it was booked last Oct. So yes I agree it’s right for people to cancel etc if they want to do that and are able, but for others there’s a lot at stake financially."
"Whilst this whole farrago is in play, it's worth trying to narrow the issues.* Ultimately, it's about priorities - everyone has their own needs, and it's worth stepping back to think what yours is if you're looking to travel anywhere. Safety, peace of mind, health, financial loss etc. * This may be an unpopular comment, but hey - the truth hurts. A large % of travellers are totally unaware of what they've actually booked, or won't look into things for themselves and rather be told something by someone else. Look into your booking conditions, your provider's (direct, agent or otherwise) website & policies for CV - most now have a landing page on websites - and most of all, take responsibility for researching objective facts from trusted sources.* If you haven't booked direct, you're generally in the realms of goodwill gestures when it comes to refunds, rebookings or otherwise unless FCO says not to travel. Visa or document issues are often not a reason for another party (e.g. your agent) to make concessions.* Most of us here on the TA Forums are not here in a professional capacity, and we try to offer help and advice - but it's just that. It helps immensely to ""ask better questions to get better answers"" so please try to not ask questions that have already been answered just because you can't read back a few posts into a thread."
"@ LKH08 - it was correct because that was the advice given by the FCO until late afternoon UK time yesterday when the advice was updated to its present ""may be tested and required to self-isolate"".Self Isolation is still a possibility and should be factored into any decisions, and that's not just Dubai but anywhere right now."
Has anyone got through to emirates?? Current wait time 15 hours!!Will the fco change their guidance so we aren't allowed to travel. Shocking that we can still travel!
"Yes I did today. See my response on ""Emirates line, can't get through"".Edited: 5:29 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Hi sharon. Sorry i can't see that thread?!
It's five back in the main Dubai Forum BPH>>https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g295…
Hi BPH12 sorry about that - I didn't see your message. Thank you to Shaun C for answering - I had no idea how to include the link.
"We r here at present and all hotel swimming pools are closed, as well as bars, no alcohol being served in restaurants"
I dont think all hotel pools are closed - i called mine yesterday and they are open as normal. Going to ring again today and check
"Do check Louise as it’s not the hotels decision to close pools or not, from what I understand it’s a direct order from the government, but I may be wrong"
I will do. I saw something yesterday about it but then it changed and said pools and beaches will remain open
The sofitel pool was open yesterday but bars were closed
Heard from the hotel. Pool and beach open as normal. Bars closed.
"In Dubai at the moment.All Theme parks, amusements, attractions are closed. Global Village has closed for the year (was nearly finished anyway as it only opens in winter).All bars, pubs and lounges are closed. I don’t believe this includes licensed restaurants as I had a beer at Apres in the Emirates mall yesterday.Our hotel pool, gym and sauna has closed and after today, our hotel breakfast will be served to our room (instead of buffet)We are due to move to the Atlantis on Thursday for a few days, in line with the above, the water park and aquarium etc are closed, but they tell me all restaurants are open as normal.But, it’s 30+ degrees and the sun is shining, the malls are still open, beaches are still open, the off licenses are still open.(For now at aleast)If I was in the U.K., I would probably be self isolating, apart from the odd trip to the supermarket to try and find that rare sighting that is toilet roll. Feeling sorry for myself, looking out the window at the cold rain, thinking what if..."
Thanks for the update Darren. Feel like I need to get away from here it's driving me crazy! Looking forward to some sun!
Good update Darren - is it Grosvenor House you're at?
"Spas got closed 2 days back, salons can operate but with strict guidelinesRestaurants got special guidelines enabling distancing and encouraging use of one-time cutlery and plates*Oh, and no more open buffet which makes senseBoth these rules got implemented in Dubai, but not in Abu Dhabi as of now. No reason to think that there wouldn't be similar rules there any time now*brings up the hypocrisy of so many ""woke"" movements today, but that's another topic"
"Does the closure of buffets make a material difference to bookings?We are booked for 2nd April all inclusive including buffet meals. We are yet to talk to Value Added Travel to confirm if we can reschedule or refund - we've been trying since the weekend. I wish the FCO would just advise against travel. We booked this as a treat after a very difficult bereavement and now no none feels like we should travel, but it's such a lot of money."
"I wish it was 30 degrees here. If you are at GH Darren, can I ask if they are still letting you use the beach at LRM"
"Just got home last night, everything seems to be shutting down, restaurants had very few people in them. Bars / clubs closed or closing. Attractions closed.Around pool etc very few staff about and people for that matter. All malls closed apart from Dubai mall but I can see that closing if it hasn’t already."
News Flash.From Foreign Office:For the next 30 days the UK Government is advising against any non essential travel globally.
"We are currently at the Millennium Atria in business bay.We have been to the Jumeirah public beach (by four seasons) and Sunset beach today (a bit noisy due to ongoing construction), so no issue with beaches (so far).As far as I am aware, from speaking to our hotel and friends who live in Dubai, there are currently no plans to close the beaches, there is just advice to spread out to at least 2m apart. As per our friends who live here, “it’s winter and no one goes to the beaches in winter”And they were correct, I was expecting Spanish riviera style occupancy with not a square foot of sand in sight, but I was pleasantly surprised.Given that there is no much else to do at the moment, I expected the beaches to be rammed, but there was plenty of space around to just relax and soak up some sun...Very selfish, but my only current dilemma is whether we be able to get a decent Friday family brunch as it will be our last day with our friends in Dubai as we fly back to the U.K. on Saturday..."
"@darren beaches are never really hopping in Dubai like they would be in the costas of Spain etc but they are usually busy around this time of year, the public ones anyway up around JBR. It might be winter, but you just wouldn’t be able to lie out there in the summer at all.Was there at Christmas a few years ago and the beach at JBR was very busy every day"

"Thanks for the link Maher, we thought this would be the case, ah well..."
"Wow, Pools closed, I wouldn’t survive without a pool in the heat. I’m not going until May but ideally I would like to cancel. With no malls or water parks and attractions it’s not good.Edited: 7:29 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Well we are still here & I have to say it’s strange & not everyone is adhering to the new rules. Our pool is closed but our private beach is still open as is the public one (JBR) however looks either side of us, the Sheraton & Double Tree Hilton pools are open. I’ve been here a week & it’s been very quiet in the evenings, last night JBR was rammed, I’m assuming because lots of hotels have closed their restaurants?? Some are distancing tables as they should, some are not, some are frantically cleaning non stop, others are not. We are still having a great time, the sun is shining, it’s hot & it appears less frantic than what we are seeing & hearing from the UK!"
This just in . All Visa upon arrival stoppedhttps://wam.ae/en/details/1395302831595
"In addition, all pre-issued visas cancelled as well, including the ones issued before March 17 as previously stated."
