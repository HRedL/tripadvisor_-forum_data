"The U.S. State Department has announced a global level 4 travel advisory, directing Americans to cease international travel and for U.S. citizens abroad to either return home or to shelter in place, as the coronavirus spreads across the U.S. A Level 4 advisory warning, the state department’s most severe warning, would elevate the current Level 3 warning put in place last week —which recommends U.S. citizens to rethink their international travel plans— and indicates how seriously government officials are taking the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier reporting indicated that while Secretary Mike Pompeo supported the measure, figures inside the state department worried the directive could cause panic for Americans currently stranded abroad, according to Politico. https:/…6ae7274a6f13Edited: 4:43 pm, March 19, 2020 "

It says to cease international travel.
"How, much time our they giving people to come back?"
"Mexico is international as are Caribbean Islands, Costa Rica...ie many of the spots US travelers head to for spring break."
Never mind it said border could close early as Friday
"Barlette Dan...maybe this will be your kind of English to understand?The State Department raised its travel alert to Level 4 for the entire world, an unprecedented move aimed at keeping Americans from going overseas as the Trump administration tries to get control of the corona virus.In a notice Thursday afternoon, the department said Americans who venture abroad may find their travel plans “severely disrupted” and “may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe.” Level 4 is the highest advisory in the State Department’s travel alert system and is normally reserved for countries in ‘a state of war such as Yemen and Somalia.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…"

"The State Department is urging Americans not to travel overseas and to return to the United States if they can, a move that comes amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The Level 4 travel advisory warning against all international travel also indicated that citizens who stay abroad should expect no assistance from the US government if they decide to remain abroad and find themselves stranded amid a health crisis.“The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. In countries where commercial departure options remain available, U.S. citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period. U.S. citizens who live abroad should avoid all international travel. Many countries are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. Airlines have cancelled many international flights and several cruise operators have suspended operations or cancelled trips. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe.”https:/….XnPHGUBrXPM.twitter"

"In brief: return from Mexico to the USA, the government is not going to help you if you remain there after all the airlines cease their flights."
"It's not a ""ban"" it's an advisory."
"Alexandra beat me to it hence why I removed my post.Thanks Judy for the heads up! International travel would also include Mexico not just ""across an ocean."" Other cities in Mexico are already closing up shop relative to restaurants and bars. Feel bad for all the locals who depend on tourism to support themselves. Depending on the country you are traveling from you can be stuck indefinitely but that might not necessarily be a bad thing especially in a place like Cabo unless all the bars close down but still not a bad place to be quarantined on a nice resort with a heated pool."
Just inGovernment to announce Friday border closure with Mexico similar to agreement with Canada.Time to come home
"Dan,Merriam-Webster's definition of abroad ""beyond the boundaries of one's country : in or to a foreign country"". At least you got me thinking.It is just an advisory but far beyond what I'm willing to risk. Now if I didn't have a kid or a job, things may actually be better in a warm climate for this. But don't listen to me as I was passing this off along with the swine flu.I canceled our trip to Guadalajara for tonight a few days ago and the condo owner does not want to give us credit to use in November but is looking into it.Edited: 5:58 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Happening all over. I’m told Bahamas is shutting down. No one allowed in. Panama and Costa Rica have already. Hehe only reason I know if a few guys I fighting with some fishing lodges trying to get a refund (big bucks)

"Yes, I feel bad for Mexicans in particular those directly employed in tourism."
"Alexandra H, yes it will be horrible, but unless there is a really severe drop in tourists coming in, I'm afraid the Mx government will be reluctant to implement any effective means to control the virus. I'd rather have my friends there alive for my next visit."
"It's not only Mexico. Here in Seattle lots of people ""directly employed in tourism"" have already lost jobs over this situation (like hotel employee and restaurant layoffs)."
This coming from one of the more condescending posters on this site.
The likelihood of a person catching this virus still remains low according to the CDC. Plus lots of folks can be asymptomatic which might explain the myriad of world wide quarantines. In other news the 1995 movie Outbreak is streaming on Netflix. Might give it another watch with nothing to do but to be self quarantined at home!
"Actually, the CDC says this is a highly contagious virus that is easily spread, like measles:“How easily the virus spreadsHow easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.”https:/…transmission.html"
Yep. Just cancelled our trip. So very sad. We will come visit after all this blows over. Sad we could not support the travel industry.
"“For most people, the immediate risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to be low.” Per the CDC. Be safe everyone!"
