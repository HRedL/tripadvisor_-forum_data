Can anyone please share their recent international arrival experience at Mumbai airport? I’ve heard they are screening international arrivals for Coronavirus. Curious how long the lines may be. I’ll be arriving from the US via UK. Are US and UK passengers subject to medical screening as well? Thank you in advance for your reply.
"All international arrivals into India are being screened. This screening is actually just checking of tmperature using infrared thermometers. In addition, each incoming passenger has to fill out an additional form giving travel history.

"Yes, passengers from US & UK & all other countries are subject to medical screening at airports on arrival. There is a form to be filled at the airport for this. There are msgs on WhatsApp saying that passengers have to stand in long Q to get these forms. So better to get it printed, 2-3 copies & arrive with that. I too have received msgs & blank form on my WhatsApp. One of my Indian relative visited US (Chicago)for his office work from 1st march & arrived on 8th March early morning at Mumbai airport. He is a frequent traveler within India & also to US, China, Japan etc for his work. He says it didn't take much time for him, they checked his temperature. May be because he is an Indian & visited only for a week. But if you are a foreign national & visiting India for the 1st time or after some months or years then there can be more medical screening. On WhatsApp videos & in news on TV, we see that all the passengers are being medically screened on arrival for Corona virus."

"Arrived at bombay today,1st everyone have to go through temperature check and then get the declaration form stamped from the staff,we got the deceleration form on board,after that passengers arriving from selected countries (around 20 countries) or visited those country's in recent days have to go through additional screening and for us it was normal immigration,it hardly added 2-3 minute for us.https://flic.kr/p/2iD8Kenhttps://flic.kr/p/2iDcVi6Edited: 8:08 am, March 11, 2020 "
