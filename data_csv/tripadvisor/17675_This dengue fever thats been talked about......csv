Ill be in Rarotonga in May 2007. I have heard from various people that dengue fever is a bit of a problem at the moment.  Is there any truth to this? If so wots being done about it? can I do anything when im there to protect myself other than a good insect repellant?

"HiWe're going in June and being a serious mosquito magnet I've been doing a fair bit of researchI agree that it would be wise to do some reading yourself but very simply ( and please someone correct me if I've got something wrong here)Dengue is spread by mosquitos that like hanging around during the dayIt's really nasty but rarely kills you although I think it can be a worse problem for childrenNo inoculation , only preventative high DEET repellant i.e BushmansAccording to my doctor, don't wear anything perfumed i.e hairspray, deoderant go unscented, cover up if possible,use mosquito coils, repellant and common sense, and book somewhere with insect screensI believe there are plans to spray as soon as weather settles down( maybe already) although there is some question about the toxicity and that it shouldn't be as much of a problem in the winter months ( I hope)Hope that helps a bit Tricia"
"The larger resort properties spray for mosquitos, smaller places no.But honestly mosquitos congregate in standing water which is around homes and not usually resorts. A good mosquito spray for your person, and coils for your bungalow in the evening/early morning when mosquitos are most prevalent would be in order. Lots of the small properties provide mosquito coils as well. I wouldn't worry about it too much unless you are camping.sunny regards,shully"
"Just kidding about the camping :)not allowed in the Cooks. Just meaning some properties that are off the road and in jungle like areas are more prone to mosquito heaven.sunny regards,shully"
" Kia orana, A small correction with regard to Shully's remark that only resorts and not smaller properties spray for mossies and insects.In fact some do. Tipani"
"My understanding is that it is locals who have been the main victims so far. 20 odd visitors from NZ have been infected, all but two were returning Cook Island residents. I am off to Aitutaki in a couple of weeks and have found little information on the outbreak there. if anyone has any info I would appreciate hearing it.CheersJason"
thank you Tepani! Great to know some smaller places do spray!:)shully
"Yeah, from what i understand about past outbreaks of dengue - the following is generally the case:1) The largest grouping of outbreaks generally occurs on the west side of the island. This is because the winds there are partially blocked (it's the leeward side of the island). Remember, that mozzies are generally poor flyers in windy conditions and prefer it still and calm.2) Locals are the one most often affected and cases of visitors getting the disease are ""relatively rare"" (though they DO happen). The likely reason for this is because visitors tend to stay near the shoreline where the tradewinds are strongest and so again, there tend to be less mozzies. Locals on the other hand often live inland along the back road and such, where the winds are often broken up by trees, structures, and foliage.3) Summertime (Dec-Mar) is the time when dengue outbreaks tend to occurr. I think because the mozzy that carries the disease has a life cycle built around the warm season. Can't seem to recall hearing about outbreaks during the ""winter"".4) Dengue affects not just the Cooks, but potentially any place with a tropical or possibly even subtropical climate. There have been outbreaks in Hawaii and Florida in the past, as well as in French Polynesia and throughout south-east asia. In 2005 Singapore had over 14,000 cases (and 19 deaths).Not wishing to minimize the issue, but don't think it should be overblown either. No doubt about it, this year HAS been a bad season for dengue on Rarotonga (worst one I've heard of - though my knowledge of past outbreaks is admittedly pretty limited).If you wear insect spray and try to minimize the time spent in the interior (Wigmore Falls is TERRIBLE for mozzies) you should be just fine. As I've already mentioned, the coastal strip is generally mozzie free (or nearly so anyway). In addition, most, if not all of the resorts will have insect screens on their windows (not always true with rental houses though). Using, insect coils sure wouldn't hurt either.Ken"
"My daughter was in Rarotonga last month for a week. She said she only saw a couple of mosquitos--she stayed at a Backpackers place. I was very worried because she had dengue fever before and read that if you get it a second time --a different strain, that you can get very ill. She didn't get any mosquito bites and did trek through the jungle. She never heard anything about a dengue breakout while on the island until I e-mailed her. I have 6 more working days until our trip to Rarotonga! My daughter said, ""I can't believe you are going there--it is soooo nice"". She had a great time even though it poured rain for 2 days of her trip. I'm not going to worry about the mosquitos. But I will use the deet.My question--Will I have any problems taking a a food suitcase--packaged foods to use on our trip? Then I use the suitcase to fill up with our purchases for the trip home. "
"No problems, just declare it. The customs people will check to make sure it is packaged as opposed to fresh"
"well, this poster is from Massachusetts and either he or companion got it while on vacation this year:tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294328-i2626-k102â€¦"
Ready the local news the spray program has been cancelled with reported new dengue cases falling dramatically. The outbreak may have peaked
"Well i feel much better informed and less worried. We will make sure we pack a good repellant, ive checked and our hotel room is fitted with screens. We will just be aware but not go overboard. It sounds like cases have died down a bit and as we wont be there till May im sure we will be fine. Thanks everyone.P.S Redbeach use as much luggage weight and take as much food as you can, youll save yourself alot of money. Customs seem to be pretty good as long as everything is packaged well."
"a friend of a friend is currently living and working in the cooks ( not sure what island) and just came down with dengue. A bunch of ppl she knows has it too. She tested positve via blood test. She's been in bed for about 2 weeks with a rash, fever, and aches. "
A friend of mine has just returned from a three day stay in Rarotonga and has been diagnosed with dengue fever after visiting his doctor for headaches and a rash. He stayed in a top beach resort and has said he used repellents. 
Canceling the eradication program seems really dumb to me. Kind of like stopping your antibiotics course when you haven't finished it just because the symptoms have eased up. Then the problem returns.
That's what seems to happen every time in Rarotonga. They do a big cleanup and things seem to be ok for a few years. Then there's another outbreak.
"My partner and I just got back from Rarotonga (late Sep 07) and didnt really see any mozzies until we went for a short trip to Wigmore Falls. As soon as we got out of the car we were covered in black and white striped mozzies and had a quick look at the falls before jumping straight back in the car as I didnt like the look of the little things (about 30 mozzies had got in the car while the doors were open). Had no idea about dengue fever at the time but a couple of days later we were both very ill. The plane trip from Raro, then to NZ, then to Australia was the worst I've ever had. Nearly passed out several times at the airport. Been home about a week now and we're still very ill with nausea, body cramps, diahorrea, headaches, dizziness and extreme tiredness. Much like an extremely bad flu with throwing up and diahorrea thrown in. So, just a warning if you are going to check out the falls, be careful, Dengue Fever isnt fun. "
This is NOT good news! 
I would really like to hear people's feedback on this.
well according to the cook island health ministry the epidemic has been over since May with no new cases reported. But I can't find any information posted about it since the 5th of July. Any new info would be helpful. Thanks!
"Hi,Wigmore's waterfall is renowned for mossies which is the reason that I have never gone there.....I am a mossie magnet!!Tipani"
"I was very nervous about dengue but we are back and just fine. However, we did choose to avoid the interior of both Raro and Aitutaki b/c I was nervous about the mosquitoe situation there. We might have been missing out for no good reason but I didn't want to risk it."
