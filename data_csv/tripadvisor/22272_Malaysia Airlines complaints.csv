"Has anyone successfully managed to speak to them or resolve any complaints with them? if so, how?I emailed on the 8th Jan and got no response. I emailed again 2 weeks ago and no response. I then called them in Malaysia and requested their call back service. A lady called me back but as soon as I said I hadn’t received any responses to my emails she hung up.How on earth does one communicate with this company?"
"Depends on the type of complaint. What is the gist of the complaint, and maybe we can push you in the right directions. They have many different departments, depending on the complaint"
This was the original email sent to customer.relations@malaysiaairlines.comBooking REF; XXXXXName; XXXXI couldn't input my passport expiry date online as it only went up to 2025 and my passport expiry date is 2026 so I had to call which cost me £4.71 and the call centre person said they had updated it to be 2026 but when I went back in they hadn’t updated it all. I got bitten up my arms and face on the KL to London flight and the air stewardess had to provide me with antiseptic cream. This was in business class and totally ruined my flight.I ordered the chef on call meals online but my order never made it to the aeroplane and they had no record of it. I arrived at Phuket airport early and requested to go on the earlier flight to KL as Phuket airport is not a nice place to spend 3 hours. The staff in the ticket office were very nice but even they couldn't get through to anyone and when they called to try and change the flight they received an automated message advising them they had a 40 min wait. Totally unacceptable. I have caught earlier flights where they have spare seats on budget airlines with no problems yet Malaysian couldn't even find out something this simple. The issue with not potentially taking my luggage on the flight caused me distress and stress while I was trying to enjoy my holiday. My whole experience has been very disappointing and I would appreciate a response from you addressing my issues and compensation for the issues I had to face.
"somehow i think that your ""complaint"" might have entered up on the bottom of the pile!you were bitten by an insect on the plane? well, these do fly in when the doors are opened. the cabin is not a sterile location. and it looks as if the fa did try to help you out. and then demanding to be put on an earlier flight? that may well have been difficult due to various reasons, but you had booked the later flight and you got it. so what is the beef?and that caused you distress? get real!sorry to be so blunt, but it appears that you were flying first class and expected everybody to jump to your commands.live with it, you got there, presumably enjoyed your holiday, got a few insect bites on the plane rather than on the beach, and you got home again."
"nakagoli - I've no idea why you bothered to reply. I didn't demand anything from anyone, you clearly haven't bothered to read it properly. You've picked out 2 things from a list of issues. Please refrain from commenting unless you have anything useful to say."
If you follow the news you may have spotted that Malaysian Airlines have had some problems over the last few years and if they were a European airline would have long since gone out of business. I am sure that you being savaged by an insect and having to wait for the flight you booked will not get onto their radar of issues to address. (insects in the tropics? who wold have thought!)Best to look on the bright side and think the if you had booked Third Class you wouldn't have been given the antiseptic cream.
Which issues do you want compensated for?
This isn't a discussion or debate on my complaints. I asked for help in getting through to the airline somehow.
I think we are all trying to tell you that you are wasting your time. I can't see you getting any response
"My own thoughts on this are, that if you delete this thread, and start again, maybe you will get more help.The insect bite is irrelevant, leave that out totally. Your complaint is about your passport details not updating correctly.So I would stick with your first paragraph. As has been stated airlines aren't sterile envoronments."
"victoria. you came on a public forum, so must expect people to react to your complaint! if you want to know how to contact malaysian, go to their website (which you have done). unless there is a rep of malaysian on this site, there is no other way that you can contact them. but as i said, because of the nature of your grouse, it is more than likely it has fallen to the bottom of the pile!as regards the passport date, most airlines only list up to 10 years for expiry. when did you book? if in 2015, then understandably their listing might only go up to 2025. you caught them just before they were updating the list.as regards your meal, if they say they didnt get your order, then it is difficult to dispute it.isnt christof mueller the ceo of malaysian now? he did a great job at aerlingus, so things will only get better."
"You are totally stressing the small stuff, I think I can understand why they are not dealing with you. Im genuinely astounded that you are not only asking for compensation for them, but actually chasing them. These complaints probably win the award for the most baseless made up complaints we have seen on here this year. And that's saying something.give it up, they are not going to compensate you for this list of trivialities."
"Compensation? For what, and how much would make it all better for the OP? Minor inconvenience, an insect bite, not getting a specific meal, (when no menu options are guaranteed anyway) and not being able to make her onward travel earlier than she had actually booked?This takes the proverbial biscuit so far this year..................Mon"
"Wow, I wasn't aware that paying over £2500 for a service meant I couldn't complain when I wasn't happy."
"Of course you are entitled to complain, but in my view, in the grand scheme of things, none of your grumbles would warrant compensation..... A nicely worded apology from the airline, maybe, but compensation for minor issues, almost certainly not. How much would make it all OK for you? Have you evaluated or quantified a sum you have in mind?Mon"
"paying for first class travel certainly wont protect you from insect bites....insects are not class conscious, they will bite anyone. not sure though, if you get a better class insect in first class.and your comments smack a bit of ""dont you know who i am......""you also say that phuket is not a nice place to spend three hours........... that really defies a response"
The insect has written an email to Malaysia Airlines too...... Literally flew through security and straight onto the aircraft. I settled down in my business class seat. Apparently it was the wrong seat and only found this out when someone tried to sit on me. He didn't even ask me to move. You provided a an excellent host for a lunch of human blood. Yum. Although I did get sick afterwards and I may have had some blood carrying the dykwia virus. The seats were wide enough for me to spread out my full rear mid gut sac without over-spilling into the isle and there was enough room to accommodate my wife Midge's elongated proboscis.We were late departing which worried me as my lifespan is only a few days but conditions on the aircraft were excellent for mating and Midge managed to lay about 500 eggs before she collapsed and died. I was most dismayed that you didn't make an emergency landing at a nearby airport. If you do respond could you please make it in the next couple of days...Edited: 4 years ago 
"Wonderful response Mr Marcoos.Puts it into perspective and I needn't bother with my less erudite reply, but in a similar vein (get it?)"
"Marcoos,Was the IFE movie "" The Sting"" by any chance?Mon"
"MsVictoria, I'm not sure what you hope to achieve by speaking to someone, but my feeling is that you won't feel much better after such a conversation even if you manage to have one. What sort of resolution are you looking for?I think that the most you'll get, or can expect, is a template reply apologising for the issues you faced on your flight."
"I'm still trying to work out what she wants compo or an appology for?If I was the airline, I certainly wouldnt be giving an appology, and as for compo, thats just not going to happen.Move on Op, it just wasting your time with your frivolous claims."
MsVictoria - stop with the petulant attitude. It won't get you anywhere. Put the boot on the other foot. How would you feel if you had received the type of email that you have apparently sent the airline? Would you respond? No? That's probably why the airline hasn't responded.
"The apology, if given at all, won't be sincere and it won;t be for any specific aspect of the complaint, at least in my experience. That is the most that MsVictoria can hope for, and in my view she would find a conversation with any member of staff, including a manager, very frustrating.The complaint about the date son the website may have some grounds, but that's about it as far as I can see."
"Well, thanks for all your abuse but I have received a reply now with an apology and an offer of compensation.Have a nice day y'all."
I sent a compliment to MH a couple of days back regarding an excellent crew member on a recent flight and received a reply within 24 hours. The reply was from a personal email account rather than just a generic one.
"victoria. glad to hear that you got a response. i guess that they had to wait for the insect to recover and then had to interview it. i trust that its punishment was not too severe, and that it lives to bite another day ! LOLwhat exactly did they apologise for? or was it just a generic apology with the offer of some free air miles?"
"They offered you a compensation over a mosquito bite? There was not even a delay in your flight.You chose the 3 hour connection and you ve got some ""unhappy meal""...Malaysia Airline went missing ,, got shot and you were offered a compensation??Really?that's not fair."
"I am facing the same case scenario, Can you tell me if you have resolved your issue or not?"
what? are you looking for compo too over a mosquito bite?
"Rufina, im assuming you can read. Try reading a few posts up and you shall seek what you are asking."
"Well if I can write, I definitely can read as well... But initially in a frantic situation where in I have almost 50 sites open for a lost baggage claim and complaints, I hadn't seen the replies to any other post up there. I came across the post for Ms Victoria and just hit reply as I could relate to it big time."
"I was going to suggest the Malaysia Airlines office, in London, in Cromwell Road, I think. Calling their call centre is another exercise in hopeless!After a cancelled flight from Sydney, uselessness in KL and downright incompetence in London, and then they lost my luggage, I found that their office was not far from my hotel.I called in and made a complaint, which went no further than the receptionist, and no result. The next day, another visit, but this time I wasn't quite so polite. I'm a good size and taller than the average Malaysian. I also have a good voice. A large, hollering person does get more attention.Result - an apology for all the inconvenience, they gave me what I asked for - which wasn't much and they should have just said yes on the first day after all the problems they had caused me. And they hoped I'd continue to be such a good Malaysian customer. Not bloody likely!"
"rufina. so it is lost baggage that you have a problem with? did you report it at the airport with the handling agents? did you get a tracking number? luggage is not lost or mislaid by an airline, but by the airports at either end . if you have a tracking number and there is no sign of the luggage after 21 days, you can claim compensation. however, if you claim from your travel insurer, they will pay out any excess over the legal liability of the airline.as for jack, do you really think that hollering and berating a person smaller than yourself is very polite? i dont!but you say you got an apology.....for what?"
"And they hoped I'd continue to be such a good Malaysian customer. Not bloody likely!------------------On behalf of any future Malaysian customers, many thanks."
So bad service.no consideration.the girl counter where i drop my bag and luagage ask me to wrap all the boxes which i already pack and tie properly.can you all imagine 10 boxes she ask me to wrap.she tell me that was policies and the not believe with their own workers.but we need to waste our money to wrap the bag?so stupid.then when our thing missing the service counter said we cant do anything.they know their own policies only.but not responsible.
Que????????
"you brought TEN boxes to check in, none of them wrapped or tied? sheesh"
"Check in isn't a post office..... what do you think would have happened to your unwrapped parcels, or partially wrapped parcels in the hold during the flight and being thrown around by the baggage handlers?"
I don't think it's bad service at all to ask you to wrap up boxes that are going into the hold.
Mefahira AWelcome to TA upon joining and congratulations on your forum debut!Maybe you should consider DHL for your future shipment needs.Presumably you saw the terms and conditions of carriage when you booked your ticket and didn't think they applied to you?
"Hi,re: 36I think we'd need to see what these ""boxes"" were in reality -- be that size, condition, number and other factors.. In my experience, it is not *normal* for a carrier to >require< that boxes be 'wrapped', but it is not entirely outside of reasonable.. but for me, that would be driven, in part, on the boxes in question.If they aren't/weren't in the best overall condition (and that alone could commonly be grounds for a refusal of acceptance) for air travel, then I could see the carrier asking/requiring you - the passenger - better seal/strengthen them... So, for me, I think more details are needed here.. as to the implied claim that MH is somehow liable or at fault for not having or not supplying said wrapping .. given that securing baggage is the passengers responsibility, then I don't think there's any onus on MH to have such materials.. Now, IF it were some kind of localized policy or something that was a last-minute change -- then perhaps I could see an argument made for MH to provide it.. but as a baseline, packing materials aren't the carriers duty.The last part about items having allegedly gone missing -- that to me is why my initial question of what was the condition of these boxes comes from... I'm wondering if they were borderline suitable for transport -- and while in transport they broke open and contents lost.Travel Safe,"
"this was a case of a poster allegedly turning up with TEN boxes. now if it was a private passenger, did they really pay for 10 pieces of luggage? but if it was a commercial entity, they would be fully aware of the need to properly wrap and secure boxes for transport. i can just visualise the sight of a luggage cart, standing out in the rain and with the cardboard slowly disintegrating"
This is a Pathetic airlines with worst service and worst customer relation services. If possible in all means try to avoid flying with this company .I already had a verybacd experience with them and to y surprise even after raising several complaints and talking to correspondents at the airports they do not help you out .On thing that is consistent with their staff is arrogant and rude attitude. Fly on your own risk
So far you only wrote a rant helping nobody. What went wrong?
"I have flown malaysia airlines in business class many times. Most were fine. I do have status and once when I did complain, they sent an apology and an invitation to join their loyalty program, and I already had status with them due to several business class flights from nz to europe. Eventually they gave me some miles, but I just put it down to experience. No point in getting all worked up and wasting energy and time. It happens, even to those with status."
"Frequently ""arrogant and rude attitude"" is code for:- I did not get what I wanted, or- I broke the rules and they did dare to enforce them."
"Hi,re: 44""This is a Pathetic airlines with worst service and worst customer relation services. If possible in all means try to avoid flying with this company .

While YOU appear to be dissatisfied, absent more facts (not opinions, but objective facts) it is hard to say if MH really failed or if there was just a gap in terms of expectations. Naturally, every carrier wants their passengers to leave with a positive experience, but the reality is that there are some things that are either not controllable by the carrier or only partially controllable and some issues that, in the carriers thought process, don't rise to the level of a ""legit"" complaint.I also agree with #47 in that absent more facts to the situation, it MAY be the crew was wholly correct and professional, but didn't go/say what you wanted. it could ALSO be that they were unprofessional... but facts here provides better clarity.Travel Safe,"
"Since this topic is talking about Malaysia Airlines complaints, I would like to share my experience here and appreciate that anyone who read it give me some opinion or advice. My case as below:I bought a ticket through American Airline, from Kuala Lumpur to Lima, will transit in London and Miami before arrive at my final destination Lima, Peru. My first flight was operated by Malaysia Airline from Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow, connecting to Miami and then Lima with American Airline. During my check-in in KLIA Malaysia Airline counter, I got all the 3 flights boarding passes and my check-in luggage will direct to my final destination. However, the check-in counter personal didn't check that I don't have a US VISA on hand to transit in Miami. I boarded the plane to London and got denied boarding to Miami due to this issue.May I know if the check-in counter personal should be responsible for checking of all my travel document including my valid US VISA before issued me all boarding passes?I wrote a complain to Malaysia Airline for this case since January but there is no reply at all from them. I contacted MAVCOM and they already highlight my case to Malaysia Airline, but I'm still waiting for a reply."
">>> May I know if the check-in counter personal should be responsible for checking of all my travel document including my valid US VISA before issued me all boarding passes? <<<No, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring you have the correct documentation for travel is yours. You unfortunately paid the price for the fact that a visa/esta is required for the Usa, even if only transiting. The airline were correct to stop you at London as they would have been heavily fined had they allowed to board the aircraft to Miami."
"liauchinfoo,I am sorry that you didn't find out before your trip that the US doesn't have sterile transit. All passengers arriving in the US are required to go through immigration and customs even though they are only transiting, thus for Malaysian citizens a US visa is required. While I agree the counter staff at KUL had a lapse in checking for US visa, but if the correct protocol was followed you would have been denied boarding there and then. You are not due any refund as it is the passenger's responsibility to check visa requirements for their journey and to obtain the necessary visas."
"It would have been too late to get the visa even if check in had asked you for it, the outcome is the same. Sorry."
"Josh, you are right. My point is that they should not issue me any boarding pass at all and not to let me board the plane to London at the first place.Bella, I actually got a valid 10 years B1/B2 US VISA that time, but it was left at home that time because it was in my previous 2 expired passport.Do u guys think I am able to get any kind of compensation due to this mishap done by Malaysia Airlines?"
"NO ! Your fault, your loss."
Absolutely no refunds or compensation due.All airlines state that it is the passenger's responsibility to be in possession of the correct travel documentation. That means that you should have checked what you required and made sure you had proof of your US visa with you. Only you are to blame here.
"The only advantage as I see it in being denied boarding at the start of your journey would be that you would be at home in Malaysia. You still wouldn't get a refund on your ticket, and you wouldn't be flying unless you could dash home and return with your US visa before they closed boarding, which is unlikely given how long it generally takes to get to the airport at KL.Edited: 3 years ago "
"YorkFoodie, ya, that's what I'm thinking, even I can't make it to board my plane in KL on time after dash home to get my US VISA, I'm still able to reschedule my next day flight instead of get me stuck in the London airport, right?"
"No, not necessarily. You could only have rescheduled your flight if you'd bought a flexible ticket that permitted changes. Most of the cheapest fares don't permit rescheduling by the passenger."
"Ya, I know that. Mine is not cheap though and it was a flexi tickets."
Do not fly Malaysian with children. Our family of 6 was allocated seats all over the plane on an overnight flight from KL to Adelaide on MH139 on 28/4/17. They put our 2 yr old and our 4 yr old together apart from other family members. Complaints went unresolved. Take seats or get off plane. Other families were treated similarly. Never fly with them again ! Dale B
"Why didn't you choose seats when you booked? That's what most people do. Expect because most people had booked their seats there were simply none of the ones you would have wanted together, to make it possible. Of course you're not going to get great seats if you leave it till check in!It would be the same with any airline...."
"""They put our 2 yr old and our 4 yr old together apart from other family members.""Did it not occur to you to move one of those children and have an adult sit in the seat next to the remaining child?????"
">> They put our 2 yr old and our 4 yr old together apart from other family members. Complaints went unresolved <<Suspect more to this than what is posted, due to the comment ""Complaints went unresolved"" which is different from unanswered."
your choice! but why did you not book seats in advance?
If I understood properly the seat reservation fee is around 50 MYR (USD 12) per seat. Hence for a party of 6 this is around USD 72. You have elected to save this amount and have received what has been left over. I do not see why you are blaming the airline when you should blame yourself.Finally and as mentioned above. You can always swap seats of your party and have an adult sitting close to a child. This is not only better for the child but also appreciated by fellow passenger who do not feel obliged to act as a nanny and the cabin staff.
"I also raised a Complaint against the airlines and after one acknowledgement it's been weeks and I havent got any response yet.I don't know how to chase-up for this.Hi,This is regarding the mishandling of baggage against reference the reference number mentioned above in the subject. The baggage took almost one day to delivery and I was asked by the customer service provider to buy dome daily utilities which will be reimbursed by the airline. We were two people travelling and Singapore being a new place we had to manage a lot of things and places to buy from. We were there for our honeymoon and one day was spoiled because of you and we then had to look for stores to buy basic garments and lavatories. I am attaching the bill for the claim and also need some compensation for the problems and grievances faced by both of us. I never expected this might happen with a name which has been famous for the best service amongst all the big players.Thanks and regards,Ravi SherwalManager OperationsCapita IndiaContact no-9619132490Mail- ravisherwal@gmail.com"
I am not surprised that they have not responded. Where on earth would they begin?
>> I do hope when you read my mail <<It took me several attempts
Who on earth is going to bother to read that email. MH will just put it to the bottom of the pile it's so long. Compensation you want? EU261 won't pay out as you were on an inbound non EU airline.If anyone reads the whole of your post maybe they could précis it.
I have to say I also lost the will to live less than half way through your outpouring.
"Dianeyorkshire, I stopped reading your post after I realised you don't know that the past tense of ""are"" is ""were"".For a definition of the word you have used, please see http://www.dictionary.com/browse/where?s=tIncidentally, is there anyone I can write to and request compensation for the RSI I now have after having to scroll though that post? Regardless, I'm sure this will be another one post wonder."
"This is one of the worst airlines I have ever traveled with so far.I have 2 bad experiences with MAS in my last week alone:First experience- Flight reschedule is a painful procedure. (only with MAS)I called the hotline last week to reschedule my flight which was code-shared with Emirates Airlines.I have to wait for 10-20 mins before someone finally picked it up.I gave her my booking reference and she said since the flight is operated by Emirates, I had to call Emirates to do the change.I hung up and called Emirates immediately.In a contrary, the operator took the call immediately without waiting.I was then told by the operator than I need to call MAS as the ticket was issued by MAS.Running out of my patience, I called MAS again.This time I was ""lucky"" to have someone nice answer my call.It was an Indian lady who took it and she was able to make my intended change.Throughout the whole process, I was put on hold twice with a total time of for more than 30mins.The reason was she had to wait for the system to update status (firstly) and the billing system to be ready (secondly).In the end, the whole phone call/process took more than one hour, to just reschedule a flight.Second experience- double charging my rebooking fee/ triple charging my fiancee's flight rebooking A simple rebooking fee turned out to be 2-3 times than its original amount in 2 individual caseshttp://prntscr.com/fq1uu6http://prntscr.com/fq1v9mI have contacted the stupid customers care.Since it's taking me almost an hour to get the chance to talk to someone, I have decided to write in via email on their contact form.So far, a week had passed. Nothing had happened. None has responded to me.This is utterly unacceptable."
"if it is unacceptable, then what are you going to do? refuse to get on the plane?you were lucky that you were able to reschedule as many tickets are non refundable. but sadly, in this computer age, holding on the phone is a common problem with many many commercial enterprises.and if you have been double charged for something, just get your credit card to dispute it."
"I think you'll find that for a while two bookings will appear on your flight details, the original and the new. Once the system is updated, only one will appear, the new one and you will get your refund accordingly. It's what happened to us last year with MAS when they cancelled a flight and we had to change to another.It was a bit nerve wracking, but it all worked out - be patient."

I've said my piece about my complaint and don't intend getting into a tit for tat with you!!! I have more important things to sort out and I would suggest you back off criticising people about spellings etc that is totally irrelevant to the forum
<<31st june>> When did an extra day get slipped into the calendar? Have I missed something.
""" I have more important things to sort out "" - says somebody requesting assistance. Airlines normally respond up to 6-8 weeks for post flight issues. They have to research the issue and yours is not the only one. Reservations are who you contact to resolve immediate flight issues. If it doesn't get straightened out on one call, call again. Be clear on what the problem is and be reasonable, simple, and direct as to the suggestions or paths you see to have it fixed.Always be polite, even if it hurts, and you feel exasperated. Stay on topic and don't talk about things like feelings and presumptive psychic issues over which they have no control."
"Hello to everyone.Two weeks ago received to me a mail and it says, my flight has been changed and it will be a delay ""ONE DAY"". Delay is of course something that might be, maybe one hour, two hour but ONE DAY, is not a delay it is a cancel imo. I have another flight that day, hotel reservation etc. I wrote this to Malaysia Airline and i asked them, please refund my money back.But they don't accept this and say they have right to do this. This is the first time such a situation happen to me. I don't know what can i do now."
we dont know what you can do either. but why not contact air asia yourself?
"Sorry. I guess I have expressed myself wrong.I have already talk with Malaysia Airlines. They sad: """"i couldn't get any refund. One Day delay is something that might be."""""" Because of them, i lost money and one day time."
"Booking Reference NEOSOY.Received a reply to my complaint today....completely swept it under the carpet, did NOT answer one question raised. Muhammad Najib Mohd Taib is that really the best you can do?"
@ Don SThis is not Malaysia Airlines but Trip Advisor.Giving out your booking reference is not something advisable.
"""Muhammad Najib Mohd Taib is that really the best you can do?""I doubt Muhammad Najib Mohd Taib is reading this thread."
"So does anyone have a good contact email for complaining rather than through their website? I paid for extra leg room seats, two seats together at the front of the plane, and due to a computer upgrade they ""lost my seats"". I did try to contact them the days before but just got fobbed off. I booked nine months in advance.This was my honeymoon btw so it was a right downer when you're at the back of the plane with some random sitting next to you when you really planned it to make it special-ish when you can't afford business/first.I want my money back at least, I know they don't a hoot if it was a special occasion."
I don't think you're being realistic hoping for your money back - perhaps the difference in what you paid for the seats but nothing more.But did it really ruin things?
"I don't think it's unrealistic to get the money I paid for two premium seats i didn't get. I expect to pay what people paid for the normal seats.It did ruin my experience, thanks for asking."
"I agree that you should get the difference back, as you paid for something which you didn't get. I hope it was just the flight which was ruined and not the entire honeymoon,"
"I just had terrible experience with them. I booked the reservation with them on 10th September over the phone and I was asked to make payment by 5th October. The flight is scheduled to be on 18th October. On 30th September I called them to make payment and I was told my reservation had been cancelled by the system and I have to pay 600$ extra to get tickets on the same day i.e. 18th October. After few calls and wait of 3 days, I am told that ""we have heard the recording of first call and acknowledge that our staff made mistake. We apologize but you still have to pay 600$ extra"". The customer service lady kept on insisting this. Since my whole trip was planned, I had to pay 600$ extra. Now I want to lodge my complaint to customer service to get 600$ back. How can I do that? Or it is even possible or worth a try? thanks."
"Tauqir A, I could be wrong but the fare is not guaranteed until payment is made and a ticket is issued. The fare may have changed after you have made the reservation. I think the ""mistake"" in this case is that they have mistakenly cancelled your reservation, but not the $600 fare difference."
When you paid the ticket that only means you agreed with its terms and conditions including the price. If you don't want the price then don't buy it and there are other airlines available to take you to your destination.
Taquir says <<I booked the reservation with them on 10th September over the phone and I was asked to make payment by 5th October.>>But would any airline hold bookings for 3 weeks without any payments. Very likely. Some airlines like AF hold the bookings at the price for 48 to 72hrs for which a nominal non-refundable fees is charged. If payment is not made within the window provided the reservation lapses. Does it work differently for Malaysian ?
should read very unlikely
Yes exactly my thoughts too.
"SAME WITH ME !!! THEY ARE PATHETIC. But they will not get away with what they did to me !!! Because of their late flight (2 hours late), I missed 2 connection flights. And after they booked me on THEIR AIRLINE, they refuse to give me FREQUENT FLYER POINTS !!! Their website states : that any Qantas Frequent Flyer will get POINTS flying cash on their airline !!!"
"Chris, if a 2 hr delay has caused you to miss your connection flights, do you not think you should have given yourself more leeway when booking the flights? Two hour delays aren’t out of the ordinary so could you not have factored in that probability? If the connections are all booked on one ticket with the same airline they will put you on the next available flight, these things happen. If they are on separate tickets then you need to accept you cocked up with your timings. It’s a blooming pain in the backside but all part and parcel of travelling. I hope you get what you feel you deserve."
"From QANTAS website:“From 1 December 2015 you'll earn Qantas Points and Status Credits based on where you fly, as well as your choice of airline and the fare purchased, on eligible fares and flights with Malaysia Airlines. “So first question is was this an eligible fare and flight”? Second question is you booked a connection that you missed by way of a 2 hour delay, if this was in one ticket did Malaysia reorganise your trip, if this was two separate tickets this was a plan fated to fail, much too short time allowed?"
"I have traveled from Cambodia to Bangladesh on Oct 28, 2017 on a business trip. On my final destination to Dhaka, I didn't find my baggage. The Malaysia Airlines representative refused to file PIR report since there are more than 15 people who lost their bags. The MH Dhaka Representative (SM Kamal Hossain, +880-1784-344735) never response any of my several call for the next days. I tried more than 100 times. I am frustrated with traveling this airline and their so call customer service."
"Malasian Airline office in Sri Lanka, the worst Airline office I deal with and I Recomend the clients to not to go with Malasian airline here after"
"I have been trying to get a response from them since last 2 months. No luck, they are bound to lose customers and fade away in history since their customer service is horrible. They have been investigating my lost baggage case since last 4 months and all I get is a message on twitter saying that it is still under investigation.Try twitter and facebook to publish your complaint. Public shaming is the best in retaliating for ignorance to customers."
"Hi, I'am posting this to share bad experience I had with Malaysia Airline. Two days back, I fly from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, MH0360. I've reached to KLIA 2.5 hours before the flight. I queued for baggage check-in, once it reach to me, Malaysia airline officer took my passport, and after checking all the pages, she wants me to wait. She refer to her supervisor. I wait for a while, then walked to the supervisor's counter, they were checking my passport. I asked them if there is any issue i can help, they respond that I have problem with my China visa. I showed them multi-entry visa to China, but they said they need to confirm the validity of visa, although all details shows that it is valid. It took almost an hour to bring me back the passport. I almost gave up on catching the flight. The worst part of this experience I had was with one of the Malaysia Airline managers, I think his name was ""Adnan"", he was talking to me with very very bad attitude, he shout at me and ask me to stay back, and do not ask them any questions. He was extremely rude! I explain that this is not first time I fly to China, and I know all the rules and regulations, and my visa is valid, I tried to show them, but he was not even allowing me to talk. Interesting point is that he was keep saying this is premium airline, and we have to check everything, as I do not see any professional or ""premium"" service from their end.After this experience I tried to contact customer service, but no one pick up, also checked their website but I did not find any way to submit a complain.For sure I will not choose Malaysia Airline to fly anymore."
"any airline has a duty to check your passport and visa, and clearly there was an issue with yours. so they had to do the required checks. whether a person was rude to you or not will depend on your attitude to them. the fact that the person asked you to stay back could have been due to the fact that they did not want their service desk overcrowded.ps. their email address is given on post number 2 !Edited: 2 years ago "
I called MA as I think I left my prescription glasses that I need for driving on a flight. I was thicken the list property number and I have sent two emails but no reply. I tried to call the London office and tried to explain what gad happens and they put the phone down in me too. I was polite.
"the chances of glasses being handed in is absolutely minimal to zero. if you were given a tracing number, you may be able to check yourself, but i would suggest that you source replacement glasses pretty fast if you need them for driving.by the way, you say you THINK that you left your glasses on the plane, could you have left them or lost them somewhere else?"
"I would definitely get new glasses asap. I'm afraid that I think your chances of getting them back are pretty low, and even if you do, it's not going to be very quick."
"I left my headphones on a BA plane, never handed in. I put it down to my own stupidity and bought new ones.<<need for driving on a flight>> that's great, you're a pilot with no glasses, that worries me!Edited: 2 years ago "
"HelloI am planned to get engaged on 4th of March 2018. We have made bookings and planned everything for 3 weeks. My fiance had tickets booked for above mentioned flight, but after boarding and almost take off the flight was brought back to gates and was cancelled and no further information was provided. I understand that there might be some technical issue that we are not aware of. I have called the contact number for Malaysian Airlines 10 times and asked them to book my fiance on flight on 3rd March 13:20 which has seats available ( i can see them on SKYSCANNER.com) but thet are denying to do so and are not able to help us in any way.On insisting they booked a ticket from KUL to BOM on 4th afternoon. This makes no sense, if we have earlier option available then y go for the later one.I would appreciate of you could make sure this does not happen to anyone in future.Edited: 2 years ago "
"pallavi k, I'm sorry for your situation, but the airlines reschedule you at their convenience. All airlines do this, not just Malaysia Airlines.The Skyscanner search may not be live, or there are only business class seats remaining while you hold a economy class ticket. As of now BOM-KUL on March 3 is listed as sold out on the Malaysia Airlines website.Edited: 2 years ago "
I’m having the exact same problem. My only active communication is via their Facebook message service however complaint has been ignored
"Just had flight KUL/BOM with MAS in business, appalling service from the crew, broken IFE only other seat next to a screaming child, vile food, warm drinks, (glad I had eaten in the lounge) dirty toilet, no landing cards for India, crew said if you dont think we have provided a good service to you esp with the landing cards, here is a complaint form, bye.. First world problems I know but when I am paying good money for business I expect more.No landing cards at BOM either the immigration staff were handing them out at the counter, making the lines even worse than normal. This caught a lot of people outRant over."
"I was to travel in Flight # MH0122 from Sydney, Australia at 1.05pm with final destination Colombo Sri Lanka. I went to the Sydney Airport Malaysian Airways check-in counter E with the details displayed in the Flight detail display screen at 11.50am and I was told by the one of the ladies over there that counters are closed. When I asked what time counters are suppose to close she said at 12.00 noon. Then I told her it is not 12.00 noon as yet and confirm the time with her wrist watch and she also confirm that it is not 12.00 noon as yet. When I asked where is the check-in counter staff she said they are all gone. Then I inquired is there a way I could speak to a supervisor she said non available at that moment. Purpose of my going to Sri Lanka due my family circumstances since my mother passed away last year and Father who is 92 years of age and living by himself and need to take him to a specialist since he has become partially blind. However I couldn't make the trip to attend to his needs as couldn't obtain a boarding pass as there were no check-in staff to issue a boarding pass. Ticket that I purchased to go to Sri Lanka cost me A$ 530/- and I was told by the same lady due to my circumstances there is a another flight leave tonight but have to purchase a separate ticket which will cost approx. A$ 850/- which I could not afford at all. In the end I could not travel to attend to my father's requirements since there was no check-in staff available at the Malaysian Airways counter to issue me with a boarding pass when I arrived at 11.50am. I have the right to be expect compensated from the Malaysian Airlines for not having check-in staff available to issue boarding when I arrived at 11.50am. Await early positive response."
"sanjay - you need to plan to be at the airport 3hrs before your flight. This is very clear at all stages of booking.I highly doubt you arrived at the time you mentioned. The check in closes 1hr before departure, and the staff do not just get up and run away, they are usually there 5-10mins after close.Even so, at the end of the day this was all of your own doing and you need to take personal responsibility for this.Malaysia Airlines are not going to compensate you, nor should they.On another note, why did you arrive so late? Is it a reason that your travel insurance will cover?"
"i too am dubious about the timing. as mentioned by above post, when a check -in desk is closed, staff have to remain in position to do the paperwork etc.i am sure that there is cctv in the area which could be checked if required.joined today and another one post wonder.....hhmmmmEdited: 2 years ago "
"Sorry to hear that you could not help your father due to missed flight. There's always a possibility that flight has been overbooked, and airline has checked-in those who have come early and when all the seats are full they may have close the counters. Have you done web check-in before reaching Sydney airport? If you had checked-in, you could have had much better chance of catching your flight even though you arrived at the airport late."
"Thanks for the comments, well I can confirm that there was non at the counter and the lady that I spoke to was clearing the tapes etc outside the counter staff of Malaysian Airways"
"Wow have just read through all of this topic, perhaps it should be renamed ""Have a moan about MH""Just to add a little balance to all the complaints, I recently flew KUL-LHR and had an absolutely wonderful flight FA's could not have been better, service and food was good. On the ground no problems with check in and on arrival baggage was in good condition. I have flown numerous airlines in all classes and can honestly say no matter how highly regarded the airline maybe , what makes a fight good is the attitude of the FA's and check in staff, no airline will ever get this 100% as humans we are subject to ""off"" days."
"To answer to your concerns :sanjay - you need to plan to be at the airport 3hrs before your flight. This is very clear at all stages of booking : For your information I did travel in Malaysian Airways during last year and I was there two hours before and there was no information about the checking counter in the "" Display screen"" and when I inquired from a person at the Airport said it will only display one hour before the check-in time which they did exactly as that person said.I highly doubt you arrived at the time you mentioned. The check in closes 1hr before departure, and the staff do not just get up and run away, they are usually there 5-10mins after close.:You can doubt what ever you want to and I know the time that I arrive near the checking counter based on the check-in counter display screen (otherwise how do you think I will know which counter to go to) and my time was also confirm as I mentioned in my complain by the Malaysian Airways lady who was outside the counter at that time. I am not sure how they managed to vanish from the counter seats if they were there even 10 - 15 min after 12.00 noon as you say and if they close the counter at 12.00 non they should be there at least 12.05 or 12.10pm. About running away part I am not sure whether they run away or walk you need to check with them that.Even so, at the end of the day this was all of your own doing and you need to take personal responsibility for this.: How can you say it is my personal responsibility when it is not, I was there before 12.00 noon and there was not a single check-in staff to issue boarding pass not even a supervisor other than Malaysian airways lady who cleaning the left over labels etc/Malaysia Airlines are not going to compensate you, nor should they.: How can you say that Malaysian Air ways should not compensate when they were not there serve the customer more than one hour before flight departure (Flight was suppose to departure at 1.05pm) On another note, why did you arrive so late? Is it a reason that your travel insurance will cover? For your information it is non of you business why I got late or not since I was NOT, moreover people sometimes experience difficulties when travel in public transport to the destination two three hours earlier I suppose you don't take public transport at all.. As I repeatedly said I DID NOT get late there was NO check-in staff to serve the customers even at 11.50AM. Travel insurance was never required in the past since I have travelled with so many airlines never ever experience situation as such. I suppose I should in the future to cover up these type of service lapses especially from Malaysian Airways (if I ever travel with them) I repeat entitle for an compensation from Malaysian Airways for sure."
"""There was no information about the checking counter in the "" Display screen"" and when I inquired from a person at the Airport said it will only display one hour before the check-in time""That's just not true. I flew Malaysia Air at the beginning of this year, and the flight was displayed on the screen well before three hours, with ths check in desk assignement showing up bang on three hours before the flight. I find it hard to belive that they would only just start showing check in desks as the flights check in were closing (that's just plain stupid).As to the person asking why you were late, of which you have a snotty remark - there is actually a reason to ask, but alas, due to your rude reply you won't get the benifit of what the advice could have been.Btw, i am another that doesn't belive for a second you got there before the end of check in occured and there was no workers left.It's obvious you were running late, check in had closed and your now having a whine about been incapable of following very basic rules (IE-Be on time!)"

"""suggest you stop commenting rather than making stupid baseless remakes"".At least i don't miss flights by running late and then cry like a girl because you fail to do something so simple as arrive to check in on time.No one believes your story about been on time and a check in agent (or who ever it was) double checked your time.

"Did you know that if you travel to the airport by public transport, which is delayed and you miss your flight, you can claim on most travel insurance policies (well, the UK anyway).

"When we bought four(4) tickets (economy) to pay the extra/additional cost for special seat (like near the emegency door) Flight : MH0067 and MH0066. Reservation No. WPCGOA.Seat Confirmation (28K, 28H, 28A, 28C). Flight MH0067 : we got the speicial seat, but MH0066 (Kuala lumpur to Incheon) has a problem. It was not special seat. Kuala lumpur airport, Customer Svc Ofcr ULIA told me that 28K, 28H, 28A, 28C are not special seat(normal economy seat) and change to 25J,K, 35J,K. Please refund the extra cost."
"You are not addressing Malaysian Airlines here on Trip Adviser, suggest you contact the airline direct."
"After several calls, Malaysian Airlines confirmed that Sapphire status does not entitle you to free extra legroom seats on their flights, unlike all the other OneWorld carriers I use (AA, BA, Cathay, etc.) It is a small inconvenience but it is one of the reasons I maintain my Sapphire status. I would like to encourage OneWorld to drop Malaysian and travelers to avoid it."
"the official one world wording is - ""Access to preferred or pre-reserved seating when offered by the airline operating the flight"" BA offer free exit seats to Emerald only...should oneworld drop them too?"
another DYKWIA ! recommending others to avoid an airline because you dont get any special favours.....?
"Here is namyang. I have claimed of Seat additional charge already. We (4 person) want the repayment of addtional charge, but no answer yet. What's up ?"
Case#2018092637004839. Can anyone know how to resolve any complaints with them? I emailed to customer care on the 17th Sep 2018 and got no response. emailed twice to reservation department as they escalated my issue but are unable to help me as customer care dept are not responding. they are untouchable or just ignoring the matter. called them in Malaysia but could not reach their hand because they too long.
"Malaysian airline is worst. We went to Mel to Kul and Kul to Ktm. We had 2 pax and 4 luggage, out of which one was very small size. The checkout attendant told us we can take small one in hand luggage if we wish, even if it exceed 7 Kg. From Mel, no issue. When we reach their country ( Kul), we were asked to pay $300 extra. When we said we can't because its not even worth, they chased us for a while. At last one of the staff was asking $100 as bribe to let it go. Disgusting airlines and staff. Had worst service ever."
If you carry excess luggage you should be prepared to pay the relevant excess luggage fees.
"you got away with it in melbourne and didnt get away with it in kul? and then you claim that someone was prepared to take a ""bribe"" ? maybe they were just trying to be generous to you by reducing the printed charge?what did you do? pay the 300$ , pay the so-called ""bribe"" (presumably you got a receipt?) or just dump the excess?"
"so, you were another who was trying to flout the baggage rules?"
"A cautionary tale about Malaysian Airlines charges for ‘reissuing’ a ticketShortly after our return to Australia at the end of October 2018, I sent the following to ‘customer Care’ at Malaysian Airlines – so far no response from the airline.1. We had purchased four tickets on Malaysia Airlines to fly Melbourne to Kuala Lumper, then five days later Kuala Lumper to Penang and then returning from Penang via KL to Melbourne  2. Two passengers were unable to fly from Melbourne to Kuala Lumper as they did not have the full six months remaining on one of the passports. Unfortunately this passenger was not aware of this.  3. We alerted MAS to this so they were aware the passengers would not make the flight from Melbourne to KL.  4. This passenger and her husband rebooked NEW flights with MAS two days later to join the party.  5. The two passengers were then informed that MAS had cancelled the flight five days later to Penang as the first leg was missed. These passengers had to forfeit the Penang flight and drive from KL.  6. The two passengers were then also informed that in order to catch their flight back to Melbourne from Penang, which they were still booked on as advised by MAS, they needed to pay a ‘reissuing fee’ of MYR 3,375 Per Passenger to reissue the ticket, even though they had not cancelled or modified this flight and according to customer service still had their seats on the flight. Despite doing what we thought was the right thing, i.e. informing MAS that two passengers wouldn’t be travelling on the MEL- KL leg, these passengers had to pay an additional bill of MYR 6,750 (about $2,300 Australian dollars) to arrive home.  7. Can MAS please explain how the ‘reissuing fee’ could be so astronomical considering they still were on the flight and could even login on the MAS website to confirm? This honestly feels like we were being scammed. Not to mention the fact that there was no reimbursement for the KL to Penang leg of our journey that was cancelled without any warning."
It us normal practice with ALL airlines if one leg on a multi destination ticket is missed all subsequent legs will be cancelled
"RE: Discriminatory policy towards disabled travelersI have been a customer of Malaysia Airline for the past thirty odd years. I am a person with a physical disability and have always asked for assistance due to two bad legs and have a medical certificate to prove the same.I called your customer service on 26 November 2018 to book my seats for my travel on 9 July 2019.This is what I was told because I need wheelchair assistance:• Wheelchair travelers cannot book seating on Premium Economy even with a payment • Wheelchair travelers cannot book seats on the Economy section and can only accept what your airline allocates on the left side of the plane.I believe you have made this policy recently as I had never had this issue in the past. I am extremely disappointed and sad that such a policy which does not help travelers like me. I choose to pay extra to be on premium economy because I want the leg room and easy access to the toilets on the long-haul flight from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. I want to be able to sit on the right side of the plane in the economy section(no Premium Economy in this sector) from Kuala Lumpur to Bangalore, because my right leg is weak and my left leg is stronger and it is easier to move in and out of the seat.Your new policy is discriminatory to disabled travelers and I strongly feel you should make a change. People with disabilities have varied issues and constraints to deal with and it is not helpful when airlines make such policies which doesn’t help passengers like myself. Please let me know how you can help me or else you will be losing a loyal customer.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Hi,I agree that carriers should seek to remove barriers to those who have varying levels and types of special needs and wish to travel.That said, I also acknowledge that in some cases there can be legitimate (as I see it) structural, design and/or safety/security issues that limit what carrier can do or what is reasonably possible to improve the experience and remove barriers.What I might suggest is reaching out to a governmental unit for help as this issue - “disabled rights” - tends to be one that gets a fair bit of attention, be that by the voting public or otherwise, and that might yield some results.Travel Safe,"
Thank you for your reply. Would you be kind enough to direct me to the right body? Much appreciate your response.
"Hi Ameetha, Noting you are in Sydney, the Human Rights Commision, may be a good place to seek further advice. I have attached a link for you with their contact details. https:/…contact-usCheersSean"
Many thanks
"AmeethaC - it looks as though you think you are writing to Malaysia Airlines but you're not, I'm afraid, this is a public forum and the chances of Malayasia Airlines seeing your post are pretty slim. You need to contact them directly."
"AmeethaC, Your case is more relevant to Disability Discrimination under Anti Discrimination Law. Contact NSW Anti Discrimination Board using this link: …nsw.gov.au/Pages/adb1_antidiscriminationlaw…By trying to contact Malaysia Airlines you will only waste your time. However, if you post your problem on their Facebook page you're more likely to get a response from the airline."
I have :)
I did post on their Facebook page and did get a reply which was of no help whatsoever. There is a body called Malaysian Aviation Commission who can look into this. I have written to them as well. Thanks
Thanks

"We had a 2hrs delay in KL on top of 3and a half hr wait, no water, told i'd have to buy some to take my medication.one lady was told she couldn't have wheelchair, yet there were at least 13 staff sitting looking at their phones for hours. Neveragain"
"I take my medication. If I need to buy a drink to take it, then I have no problems doing exactly that, though I'd obviously prefer it if I was shown some human compassion and someone would just get me some.But basically, if I ask and the answer is no, then it's not a huge problem."
"Ditto. I've had two hour delays loads of times and bought water, a meal, whatever I needed. The airline is not responsible for anything with such a relatively short delay.Maybe all the wheelchairs were already in use? They aren't limitless supplies and I'm afraid it would be a first come first serve basis....But that's the airport not the airline anyway. Not getting water is hardly a big issue! Certainly not one big enough to refuse to fly with them again, nor advise others not to, when you think of the really appalling things that happen."
"whenever i am in an airport and have to wait, ijust buy a bottle of water. do you really expect this for free? if it is essential for medication, then there is no question....you BUY a bottle of water or use tap water if it is drinkable.as for the lady who was apparently told there was no wheelchair for her? could well be but hearing it second hand is not the best. if she had arrived at the airport without such assistance, i would be reasonably confident that she did not actually need one and could sit on one of the designated seats for those with mobility issues.and then there were 13 malaysian staff looking at phones? really, THIRTEEN? all for the one flight? and maybe as they had nothing to do they were looking for details of delays etc, or as with many people today, were listening to music to wile away their time? it aint a sin !"
"@lizian2017Your complaint is groundless.If you need liquids at an airport, you have two options. 1.) You buy them. 2.) You drink from the tap (but I would not recommend that one).What do you think people are doing who have 6 or 8 or more hours of connection time? Yes, they buy food, liquids and whatever they need in a shop in the airport. That is the reason why there are shops, restaurants and bars in an airport.""lady was told she couldn't have wheelchair"" wheelchairs service is available at most every airport. But it needs to be organised in advance. Plus, there is likely more to that story then what you write."
Unless you have an a. Identify in the airport or on the way to the airport necessitating a wheelchair. They have to be prebooked I. Advance. You don’t just rock up and ask airline staff at the departure gate for the service. It’s nkt the airline that provides it anyway.Edited: 1 year ago 
If you wand food and drink included whilst at the airports then fly business and use the lounges :)
HIMalaysian Airlines is quite good with complaints as I have always got a reply. Contact them at customer@malaysiaairlines.combut as mine was about a discriminatory policy towards disabled passengers I wrote to Malaysian Aviation Commission - Consumer Affairs They were very good and changed their policy.Good luck!
"Is what I will mention below worth a complaint?I wanted to book a flight from LHT to Kuala Lumpur direct flight only in Feb. 2019I went to the web of Malaysia airlines . there was a promotion from MA and what is advertised the ticket price was £469 and the flight should be between 10th Jan to March 2019, I tried to book this flight. but on the last step before paying the total was £854 ! I phoned Malaysia airline but they confirm the price for the ticket i £854, they gave no satisfactory reason for this price and what they advertise. I then tried another web site and got the same flight specification , with a ticket price of £510.If any one want evidence! Go and try to book a flight direct from Malaysia airline web. and compare it with the same flight but from others.....today the price from MA is £940 from others £500 !!I don't know what to call this....is it deception or what?"
"The airline can set it's own fares. If they are higher than the competition's that's their look out.If you are seeing fare of £500 on shonky booking sites that don't have live prices, then you have as much chance of getting those fares booked as Swansea City have of winning the FA Cup."
">> I then tried another web site and got the same flight specification , with a ticket price of £510. << did this 'other website' have live pricing? ...I guess if you try make a booking request you will get asked for the additional £344 (possibly more) to be able to actually book the ticket"
Same here. I was advised by the cs lady named Ann that I can write in to this email to complaint about the baggage technical issue that I have experienced and eventually charged wrongly to my return trip. There's no reply at all even I have escalated as urgent with important flag. No one care! Wonder why the service this bad and non responsive.
"All airlines can be frustrating, not just Malaysia Airlines. However, I no longer choose to fly with them after 2 incidents onboard, and consequently with a very inadequate and useless call centre. Everyone I dealt with was very polite, but I lost several hours of my life, which in hindsight was stupid of me. However, I do not like to be blatantly lied to, even when it’s done in a cordial and polite way. I lost money, but thanks to their outrageous behaviour, I now enjoy a superior service with Cathay pacific."
what were the incidents that has caused you to lose several hours of your life? how did you lose money?
"No I haven't, I had my suitcases lost on a Malaysian flight from LHR-SYD, they arrived over 24hrs later, a compensation figure was agreed and that is the last I have heard from them.I have emailed numerous times and receive no replies and the compensation has not been paid over 4 months later.You can try these email addresses - customer@malaysiaairlines.comainahafieza.fauzahar@malaysiaairlines.comPAXCLAIM@malaysiaairlines.comUK- 0330 3650080But don't expect a response, go to the CAA and complain."
HELP HELP HELP HELP HELPCan anyone help me?? My travel agent has failed to get me a refund through Malaysia airlines and I have contacted them directly but they still said no... My partners dad passed away literally 5 days we were supposed to fly so we had to cancel........... they will partly refund my partner some money back but I do not get anything back at all because we are not legally married..... they even asked my partner to write a letter to confirm I am his partner of 2 years plus but they still said no refund... I paid $2.2k for this trip and now I have lost everything and I'm trying to get the money back so I can put it towards funeral and headstone cost. I have asked them multiple times even just less than half is fine but they still said no. Is there anything else I can do????? HELP!!!!
"Two things, unsure where you are from but in some countries if you have been living together in a relationship for a period of time this can be classed as a de facto relationship which has similar rights to marriage. Secondly have you travel insurance and have you contacted them. CheersSean"
"Most airlines will upon presenting a death certificate allow to cancel for free for an immediate family members death.Depending airline there might be a small fee.You have two issues:1.) From what you write you have booked not directly and now have a travel agent between you and the airline. If that is a real travel agent on the high street, that should not be an issue. If that is however one of the shonky ticket pushers on the internet, then you look at a larger issue.2.) It depends how the airline defines immediate family member. Depending the case you might have to accept that for the airline you are not seen as part of the family as you are not married to your partner."
Did you have travel insurance?
Malaysia Airlines take a booking and your money. Then they cancel the flight and refuse to give you a refund. They are a company with no compassion or Moral standards. They are modern day thieves. Their Customer Helpline is a total scam they have always been terrible but now use the Corona Virus as the reason for their gross inefficiency. My advice is use them only if there is no other alternative.
"188""Their Customer Helpline is a total scam they have always been terrible..."" and yet you continue to use them?!?"
All airlines are under tremendous pressure at the moment due to Covid19 and all have had to cancel flights - or haven't you heard?I think you have to be patient in these circumstances and email them as well as phone.I've flown with them for forty years and think they're brilliant.

"I agree in part, but disagree with your statement that MH are brilliant. As a regular air traveller ( or at least until March) I have had all sorts of different experiences with different airlines. None as bad as MH. They are terrible IMHO.A couple of examples during the coronavirus outbreak...Cathay Pacific.... absolutely brilliant. I had booked flights from Manila to Perth via Hong Kong return. After booking, Cathay were not allowed to travel to or from Philippines. THey happily transferred my flights with no problem, to Singapore Airlines. I would recommend them to anybody.Singapore Airlines...again I had a flight recently cancelled by them recently beause of Covid. THey gave me a full refund within ONE WEEK.Again highly recommended.And then we come to Malaysia Airlines....... Booked a flight recently MNL-KL-DPS. They informed me it was cancelled and gave me another date for flying 2 days later. Not a problem except for the fact that the KL-DPS flight departed BEFORE the MNL-KL departed!!!I called them and they were also confused as to why I had been rebooked onto flights that were impossible to take. THey said that during Covid they only had 1 flight per week from MNL-KL and only 1 flight per week KL-DPS. OK , so I understand that, so I made a simple request...allow me to use another airline either MNL-KL or KL-DPS to link up with your 1 flight a week. They refused to do that, saying it was not company policy!! I then found a code share flight with PAL... why not allow me to use that flight...No cannot do that against company policy. I then send an email to complain and got a reply saying they would revert back to me in 2 weeks!!! I then called to cancel and request a refund, to which they told me it takes 3 months for a refund!!!! So my advice to fellow travellers is to stay well clear of Malaysia Airlines, especially in these uncertain times . They make ZERO effort to assist their passengers"
"Agreed. They are based in Fiji, of all places. They have a terrible attitude."
"Your reply is music to my ears!! I have just posted a similar remark, thinking afterwards that I was a little bit over the top!! But I totally agree with you. Horrendous company"
"Hi Paul B, when you reply on here, your message just goes to the bottom of the list of messages on this post, so it isn't clear which person/people you're replying to. Unfortunately the ""Reply"" button on here is a little misleading for new folks as you might rightfully think it would attach your message to the post you're replying to."
