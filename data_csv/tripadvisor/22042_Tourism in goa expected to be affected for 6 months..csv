"Calangute mla has stated he doesn't expect normal tourism to resume for at least six months, he states in an interview all visitors will have to be screened during this period to ensure they are free of the virus, he commented that possibly visitors would have to pay for the tests but then quickly moved on to other issues like continuing social distances and other protocols. He called for an 8 to 10 day extension but that it was the pms decision. This is his views not the official policy of the goa government."
"I would think that another 12 months should be added to that at least. The UK are now seriously thinking of keeping the ""shut down"" for a further 18 months or until such time that a vaccine is formulated; all very much as like depicted in the film Contagion."
">> very much as like depicted in the film ContagionI'm going to read all the few Robin Cook books I missed out on, just so I am fully informed of all future events. :-)"
I think six months is incredibly optimistic. Personally I think it really unlikely that Goa will be open for business next winter.
"Some films are eerily accurate; as are some TV series. They don't help with this situation though and I am not suggesting they are; I was just making a comment; have you watched it?LGG; that is also very optimistic; perhaps 2021, if we are very lucky.Edited: 8:27 am, April 11, 2020 "
Apologies LGG; misread your post; agree with you - apologies again.
">>have you watched it? Yes, read the book, watched the movie, and I wasn't being sarcastic. I will read up the ones I didn't get around to reading. :)Between Contagion by Robin Cook and The Stand by Stephen King, we got the present and the future fully covered."
I would bet that 26 months would be a closer forecast than 6 months. Getting back to normal is a long long long way off
"I only watched it recently and was so surprised how accurate it seemed to be and it all started from bat, to pig to one hand shake, from chef to diner and ""Contagion""; unbelievable or perhaps believable!CrissLin, I think that you are very much nearer the mark; especially where India is concerned."
"If it's more than a season your going to see a lot of financially stressed goans, this season with TC going down and now the virus has seen many strapped, if no revenue next season I see a lot declaring bankruptcy, I know many who are maxed out with mortgages on new building and loans to repay on taxi & buses, a break in tourism without help from the state will push them over the edge.... new property values and house resale prices were already on a downward spiral with the indian lacklustre economy, a prolonged lack of income will just reinforce this situation..."
And this situation will be replicated worldwide.
"I'm not saying goa or the uk will be on curfew for 18months but people will have revenue issues and possibly a concern for travel, particularly if cluster groups are seen to be maintained in some countries, which has a chance of happening in India, unless they seriously up the number of tests."
"This Global Pandemic only ends when a suitable and effective vaccine is available, until then nothing will return to normal, nothing."
Totally agree BS64
"There are well over 40 trial vaccines already under assessment now, one of more of those might work.Some suggestions that August this year could see human trials begin, once approved it will see all the world's pharma companies rush to get it to market, and make a lot of money. So it is chasing the money that will be the answer. So I am optimistic that a holiday say Feb 2021 back to Calangute might just be possible."
"Hope so JimboF4, missed out on India this year."
"You may be okay with that Jimbo, but when you consider when these holidays may need to be booked; do you think everything will be up and running for then? I realise that we are all dealing with pure speculation at this moment in time."
"I dont know anyone that is seriously expecting they will be back to Goa next season, we are certainly not, not expecting travel anywhere next year. Even when things start to get back to some semblance of normality, this thing will keep popping up and who would travel with no insurance cover for it. I agree with BlackSteel, until there is a vaccine nothing will change and even then nothing is going to be the same."
"All this Covid 19 thing will be a horrible memory in a few months time, yes people will have to adapt but a large percentage of the world's population will be Covid resistant by Autumn 2020, and for others a vaccine will offer reassurance.The world will get back to its normal business in a while, because there is a need for tourism, tourists, money, food to sell and buy, hotels to stay in and all the other things that makes the world go round. Lockdown cannot go on forever, people need to live, earn, explore."
"I hope you are right Jimbo; but I really don't think you are. Until there is a vaccine, things will not go back to normal and even then, things will not be back to normal, with businesses in liquidation, pensions depleted; higher taxes, higher air fares (probably). No there is very little chance of getting back to Goa before the 2021/22 season.AND no one can make money with dead people; business need people, they are the most precious asset.Edited: 2:23 pm, April 11, 2020 "
Im sure not on my own in saying that money will be very tight for a while once this is done It will be the tax payer footing the bill So for the first time in 17 years im very doubtful ill be there next year Sharon
"World travel was never the same after 9/11,and after a pandemic on this scale it will take years to restore confidence in world travel. Governments will not allow travel to any destination believed to be unsafe,insurance companys will not insure you,holidays are going to be more expensive. And we are certainly not going back to goa this year or next or until i feel india is safe again. Apart from the money factor people’s livelihoods have been decimated and will take time to recover before people can afford to travel.  100,000 dead and counting in the world and people talking about next years holidays. Until there is a vaccine and effective drugs the world will stay in limbo"
WowWhat a dire miserable bunch
"An optimist is someone who really does not know how bad the situation really is.Your choice, you can chose to believe what ever you want to; but the facts are plain to see."
"I have mixed feelings albeit I tend to be a ‘glass half full’ person.People’s memories are short and I believe that the ‘I deserve as holiday’ mentality will prevail. It’s just a case of when. Money will not necessarily be the problem as when humans use the word ‘deserve’ they will make it happen no matter what.You also have to bear in mind that Goa’s economy needs tourism both domestic and international. There are a lot of wealthy Indians and a lot of international tourists are old gits like me with a pension that doesn’t change, in fact, it goes up every year. Us two aren’t going back to Goa next winter, not because of the virus, but because we wanted a change, so we have booked for Mexico and back to flight only, rucksacks and local buses. That of course depends on the virus.I’ve been looking back at Spanish Flu from just after WW1. It didn’t actually start in Spain but, hey ho, so what. It killed at least 17 million and possibly 50 million people world-wide and it lasted close to 2 years. This virus is no where near as viscous as Spanish Flu so how long will it last?I’m not making a prediction as to whether you’ll all be back in Goa next season I’m just hopeful that you will be and that I’ll be on my flight to Mexico January 2021!"
"I hope you are also Itcanbedone, but somehow, I don't think so. I would also like to go on my planned trip (planned for November this year - no chance what so ever; perhaps, with a great deal of luck - November 21, who knows). Pension pots will also take massive hits and it ""could be"" that pension payments / pay outs may no longer go up; they may even go down; we will all have to pay/contribute to this situation, when a vaccine is eventually discovered.Economies worldwide will need fixing, not just Goa/India's!"
"Yesterday a very prominent scientist at Oxford University said he was 80% certain that a vaccine would be in place within the next 6 months, trials are already taking place and there is a lot to be confident about. In the USA, human trials are taking place for the treatment of the virus and a drug used in the treatment for Malaria is proving to be successful in 2 out of 3 patients/ trialists. Once the downward curve of this virus starts to occur Countries will want to kick start their economies again and airlines need to be flying as soon as possible. The decision to weigh up the loss of life against the crashing of the world economy and the devastation that will cause will need to be made and it will be . There will be an acceptable number of loss of life’s to this virus around the world and it will be much less than the numbers we see for heart disease, cancer etc. I think within the next six months,or even less, the mood will be very different to what we see now and we will be managing the virus as numbers decrease.Edited: 9:04 am, April 12, 2020 "
"That's good news RR; but once the vaccine is discovered, how long will it be to: mass produce; distribute world wise and then vaccinate world wide. And I am reasonably certain that the vaccine will also have to be paid for. Even in these circumstances, no one does nowt for nowt.Also, do you think all of the airlines will survive, will the appetite return for travel immediately and how do you think the cost of air fairs (and holidays) will be affected.I, probably like most people on this forum, would like to start travelling, when of course it is safe (and affordable) to do so, but I still think in reality one is looking towards the end of 21, beginning of 22; again, I hope i'm wrong."
"Just watched a extended interview with the WHO special envoy epidemiologist on indian tv, he states it's more likely to be a minimum of 18 months before a tested safe vaccine is available to the general public of the world, I'd take his opinion over that of politicians who need to keep their communities safe and under control & keep themself in office, he also commented that the hype about drugs currently being available for distribution to cure the virus is just hype.... It's very relevant that a certain western president wants to withhold funding from the WHO, is it because he doesn't like what their preaching."
"#22 - are you for real !!!!! Air Travel Worldwide& Domestically now far exceeds that of before 9/11 & it will keep growing again very very soon.#23 Totally agree#26 Pensions - anybody currently receiving a Annuity from a Pension should be unaffected.The UK Government is to pay out Billions to furlough staff/support Business, so I very much doubt the % increase in Pensions will be affected.Those due to retire,should had been advised to invest their 'pots' into Bonds/Equity's 2-4 years before intended retirement - this eliminates the risk of crashes such as this.What is happening currently by all Nations is 'risk management' - so that Health Services can deal effectively as possible with the 1st wave infections,there seems to be more risk of a 2nd/3rd wave of infections over time that did not arise with MERS/SARS/EBOLA - incidentally,there are still no vaccines for Mers or Sars.There are Flu vaccines but there are still thousands who sadly die each year.Fortunately,life will/has to get back to normal soon for all,even if there is still the risk of infection.Edited: 10:09 am, April 12, 2020 "
#30 can you readNobody said that there was less air travel after 9/11 simply that world travel changed. Far more health and safety checks body scans baggage scans. No access to flight deck etc etc etc. When this is over world travel will change again. This has no bearing on how many travel but on the restrictions placed on travel
"Annuities, yes (if they all survive); the rest is supposition; we all live in hope; but drastic measures will need to be taken to pay off the debt. The ones that are relatively safe are defined benefits, unless of course there is a shortfall (and also the scheme has to survive) BUT no investments, pensions or otherwise are totally safe."
"Another point of view, I don't know if it makes sense but its in tune with the Herd Immunity principle -https:/…20200412.htm"
"""An optimist is someone who really does not know how bad the situation really is.""Yes and here's a tragic example:In Germany in the 1930's when the National Socialists got in power and introduced The Nuremburg Laws which specifically persecuted the Jews, large numbers of them, the pessimists left Germany and emigrated. The optimists thought things would get better, they didn't, and tragically many lost their lives.Also, pessimists are rarely disappointed."
"#30...agree with that, this is all about risk managing health services, once they are reasonably confident they can manage numbers without being overwhelmed...flatten the curve and going in a downwards direction, which is starting to happen now, economies will kick start again. There is no way it will run into next year before the world opens up again and aircraft begin to fly. It’s impossible that Governments can afford to pay people to stay at home indefinitely for a start, my prediction is that the children will return to school before the summer is finished and people will return to work, I’m predicting that could be in 12 weeks time and the hospitals will then be able to manage the number of virus patients, a vaccine will be found before the end of this year or we will have drugs and the knowledge to treat it more more efficiently. Spain and Greece are already planning for opening up again, Greece have stated the 17th June as a targeted date to start tourism. Obviously nothing is set in stone but they can’t wait to find a cure before they kick start the economy again, no country in the world can afford to do that."
"But do you think people will travel, for non essential travel, ie holidays? I have my doubts. No economy can also allow many people to die. AND India are at the beginning of their corona virus journey. They do not really know what they are about to face, don't you think? No economy can allow a massive reduction in people. People are the key to everything; there is nothing else. No people, no world, no life (as we all know it). ""A Fine Balance"""
India could have well controlled this thing if some people hadnt messed up.Still situation in India is not out of hands the authorities have imposed the lockdown strictly and violaters are being punished and penalised. If people behave sensibly damage in India will be much less than what Us and Europe will face.
I don't think so; did you see the migrant workers returning to their villages?
"Many Indians are living in the media bubble that's it's under control, those of us in the real world are just waiting on the manure hitting the fan, until India instigates proper testing and starts issuing the numbers being tested we will have no idea the true extent on where the virus is developing... they have hot spots then self isolation, where's the mass testing that's required in these hotspot communities.The clowns in charge are actually considering zonal reopening of India, god help the poor if as indicated by many professionals the curve continues to spiral in India.Edited: 5:07 am, April 13, 2020 "
"Jimbo F4, Whatever it is you are on ,please share."
"MMS. Ironically, Hitler was an optimist too. When they invaded Russia in June 1942, he was so confident that it would all be over in few months, the troops had no winter clothing. When the first Russian winter hit, all German ladies were asked to donate their fur coats, and so the Storm troopers went into battle wearing ladies clothes!Nothing to do with Goa, I know, but mildly amusing. Faced with losing our November Calangute trip, I need something to cheer me up.Edited: 6:13 am, April 18, 2020 "
"Granted India is testing less. But it is 45 days since the virus hit India. But fatalities are still low. We talk of migrant workers, possibly carrying the virus , but no sharp rise in fatalities have been observed. Actually if people are not tested & so remain undetected & get no treatment, the fatalities should have zoomed by now. It is not as if people are dying at their homes ,as is happening in Nursing homes/ aged care centres in US/UK. Nor are people dying on the roads. The cynics forecast of more people dying of hunger than the virus may be something the western media is gleefully anticipating. Though unproved scientifically, the India summer may still be a boon for Indians. The next 60 days will show us how India is moving . Will remain an optimist till then."

Hi allItcanbedone - in a similar position at the moment. We had originally planned to spend 6 months backpacking southern India from January but now sensing that Mexico and Central America may be a better option with India on hold until 2022. We were in Costa Rica for a month in February/March and fell in love with the region. I feel that Central America may be a safer option sooner but not quite sure why I am feeling this way!
6 years more like! bet tui goes bust next
Would not be surprised in the slightest Dd; Tui seemed to be in utter confusion before CV!
"18 months lockdown, were and when did the U.K. say they were going to implement that, and who is gonna pay for it, Christ there’s some doom mongers on here."
"18 months is the predicted time before a vaccine may be available and things start getting back to normal, we just need to hope a vaccine does become available"
"First day of lockdown 3.0Wine shops open hardly a customer in sight.Migrants Queuing up to get documents stamped to get relief trains back to their home states plus get their daily food allocation.Goa government announces no spare cash so most projects planned for 2020/21 on hold.Central govt announces gst expectation for April very poor which will affect both the centre & state.Delhi chief minister announces must get the state back to work & Indians will just have to get used to living with the virus.Curfew 7pm till 7am to be fully imposed.On the positive, goa reports a 17% decline in the use of electricity in april, we still saw power cuts by the way.It's now 35' and not a cloud in the sky or a tourist on the beach.You can park free in holiday street in calangute."
"Just look after yourself SG; What they are doing in India is madness ""Get used to living with the virus"" Unfortunately it will be ""Get used to dying with the virus""Try to keep safe; stay well and be your own council. - whitesix"
Thanks for the update SG.
"I think we are going to have to get used to living with one way or other, its not going away and if we get a vaccine it will probably mutate like regular flu does. Its going to be a new world and I am glad I lived most of my life in the old one"
"""Its going to be a new world and I am glad I lived most of my life in the old one""My sentiments exactly! I like watching documentaries on the TV: 24 hours in Police Custody, Police Chase, Legal etc, etc and I say to Mama Mzee that I wonder what the world/country will be like in 50 years time. A police chase programme recently shown in West Yorkshire, high speed chases, searches, drugs and none of them received a custodial sentence. Almost everyone stopped by the police was in possession of illegal drugs.We used to love going to Kenya (about 45 times), elephants have been decimated to provide Chinese Chops (desk hand stamps) artefacts etc, on our last visit to the Rhino Sanctuary we didn't see a single Rhino. Why? Killed off for Chinese Rhino Horn believed to be an aphrodisiac, Pangolins on the critically endangered species list for much the same reason as Rhinos. Chinese Tiger farms to produce medications for the Chinese domestic market. (PS: I lived in China for 2 years). And if a vaccine for the current Corona Virus isn't found we humans might be on the critically endangered list too.Yes I agree with dragonfly, I'm glad I've lived most of my life in the old world."
#50Liquor sales in Karnataka alone was ₹45 crores or £4.80 million. Probably you were giving the Goa picture Scottishgrass.
"Trek, where was the social distancing in most indian cities at wine shops... oh hardly any, that's why police were forced to close many.... will those involved now be tested, probably not."
"Just for those not in the loop.Delhi just increased the price of all liquor by 70%, yes seventy percent of the bottle price, it's been declared a covid 19 penalty.Well that's the common man screwed again."
Time to get the old beer making kit out SG.
"The don't seem to accept the irony of the situation, they get a quick boost of cash by penalizing the drinkers, ok, but they would have got most of that tax money anyway over the next few days as drinkers bought more liquor, meaning more liquor would have been required, creating jobs in production, transport & retail. Now those penalised will get a quick fix and either go dry or redistribute their funds from possibly feeding their families or pay for other services to buy highly inflated alcohol.Edited: 6:20 am, May 05, 2020 "
"Chivas Regal up 70%, whatever next!Couldn't they raise more money by implementing a few of these suggestions?Regulate the taxi drivers - force them to install meters which can be read and linked to VAT/Income?Tax the local police/officials/politicians for all the back-handers they accrue?Fine dog owners whose dogs crap on the beach? (Cows too for that matter). Implement a dog licence scheme?Fine all the drunken scooter drivers and those NOT wearing a safety helmet?Charge a fee for scooter/motorbike drivers using the Betim ferry to avoid wearing a helmet on the Panjim Bridge?Legalise the bag-snatchers so the proceeds can go to the government?Criminalise Karaoke and fine all those watching or taking part?Fine all drivers who do NOT recognise the zebra crossings on roads - those who think the black and white stripes are there purely for decoration?There must be many more?"
this will all be sorted by the end of the year and ready for tourism by November - social distance will be a thing of the future everywhere. Once people are more or less mass immune herded the virus will be gone as quick as it came.
