Your airline will not be able to fly from Frankfurt to Seattle. The airline will probably contact you with an alternate itinerary.
"The airline will be able to fly from Frankfurt to Seattle, as US residents are still allowed to enter the US from Europe. However, it may not be able to carry the OP.Every airline's call centre is overwhelmed right now. I think you have to wait for the airline to contact you."
"This will apply to you as you will have been in the Schengen Area (at FRA) within 14 days of your travel to the US. Despite what the President said it’s a ban on foreign passengers flying not a ban on flights, though most flights will be suspended. To clarify, here’s the Department of Homeland Security’s statement on the proclamation. https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homeland…Your options are (a) transit via the UK, (b) fly direct from India to the US (United, Delta or Air India), (c) fly direct from India to Canada (Air Canada), or transit via somewhere in Asia acceptable to Canada.

I am flying to Cancun from Malaga via Miami on 2 April and back on 18th April via JFK in NY. Will I be effected by latest Trump travel ban?
nacflynnAs things stand you will not be allowed to enter the USA flying from Spain
@#5: If you are not in an exempt category then you are most definitely effected by the travel ban based on the framework known at the moment. Many details are still yet to be filled in most noteworthy which airports will be allowed to receive flights from Europe for US citizens and other exempt travelers. But at the moment you are effected. Follow the news and wait till your travel date is closer.
Are European passengers (Spain) transitting in USA affected by latest Trump travel ban to USA?
Re 8 - Any passenger arriving in the USA is subject to the travel restrictions even if just in transit at a USA airport
"""Are European passengers (Spain) transitting in USA affected by latest Trump travel ban to USA?""You cannot ""transit"" a US airport when arriving internationally, you need to enter through immigration and customs. At that point you are in the country and free to catch an onward flight or travel domestically.Who are you flying with?"
"Good morning all,A friend has just returned to the UK from Tenerife and is due to fly to the USA this weekend, the latest news states that she can't because she's been within the Schengen area within the past 14 days. My question is how can the USA check this as her passport doesn't show this previous visit."
"@nacflynn #5 & #8: You can ask multiple times but the answer at this moment based on the info available remains the same! If you are not in an exempt category then you are most definitely effected by the travel ban based on the framework known at the moment. Many details are still yet to be filled in, most noteworthy is which airports will even be allowed to receive flights from Europe for US citizens and other exempt travelers.

Iberia
"Sure I get that, thanks.Will Iberia select different routes that do not include 'transiting' through the USA in order to get their passengers to their desired destination...or it it to early to say.The thing is I have booked hotels and car hire etc... and don't know at which point I should be cancelling and/or trying to get re-reimbursement from my Insurance company!"
"@ Bill #11: 1) She will have to lie to CBP upon entry which could jeapordize her future ability to travel to the USA2) These measures are being taken for a reason. One may find them justified or exaggerated but to not respect them by lying is pretty bad. As one Italian doctor explained the situation there, do you want to be the one potentially putting other people at risk of death esp the elderly and others with health problems. Will your friend know for sure that she is not a carrier? How?"
"""Iberia"" - they fly direct to Mexico City which means it would be possible to avoid transiting in the USA. Speak to them or whoever you booked through to see what options are available. You might need to wait a day for the picture to become clearer."
"@nacflyn #14""or it it to early to say""Yes! You got it. Wait till just before your travel date for airline clarity. Call your insurer now to inquire about coverage. If hotels and tours are still cancelable in whole or part you need to decide yourself to wait or cancel those."
"Friends, could you help me. I can't find information about this:does current Trump's restriction concerns CROSSING of the EU border, or concerns ANY flight from EU to the US?If I have connect-flight through Amsterdam and I stay in the aeport, in a duty-free zone, maybe I can enter the US? As I was not in EU and was just a transit passenger?Thank you. I have flight on the 16th of March((("
Thanks. I've tried contacting Iberia in Spain and UK and via twitter and Whatsapp but they are totally useless. The Whatsapp number is an automated robot. Its impossible to speak to a human being.
"USBT, I just read the link you posted. From what I could deduce, Americans could still travel to Europe after the ban and still come home but thru select airports. It was not mentioned where these airports are. I do presume they are the same 9 (I think) that were mentioned before as entry points for those transiting Korea, Japan, etc.I believe JFK is one.Thanks!"
"I am in the same position. - travelling to US from UK via AMS, As it stands I dont envisage the transit factor being an issue, as technically being in transit would not constitute being in the Schengen area. However it's more likely to depend on what the airlines intend to do. If my flight from AMS to US is predominantly booked for EU citizens or those that have been in the EU within 14 days, who therefore wont be able to fly, I cant imagine KLM wanting to fly just me on an empty aeroplane to the US."
"@#21""As it stands I dont envisage the transit factor being an issue, as technically being in transit would not constitute being in the Schengen area.""No one knows if that is the case or not, so total supposition at this moment.More critical is where EU flights will be allowed to land in the USA and if you can or want to get on a flight to a designated port of entry. What those airports will be should be announced within 48 hrs according to DHS. So it's a question of wait and see.I myself, US dual citizen, am scheduled to fly shortly to Boston from AMS. I will also have to wait and see what airports are designated and if that suits me or not."
"This is the actual text of the order:""Section 1. Suspension and Limitation on Entry. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States is hereby suspended and limited subject to section 2 of this proclamation.""To be present withing the Schengen area you need top pass through the border which would indicate that transit is not affected. I'm sure this will be made clearer as the day unfolds."
"but if I am just transiting Europe (going from i.e. Russia, that is not included in Trump's list)? If I stay inside the airport, not entering the country, without crossing the EU border? Can I enter the US in this case? Thank you!Edited: 6:46 am, March 12, 2020 "
"I guess the U.S. government is still working out the detailed implementation procedures. We may just need to wait.In my view, it may be physically impossible to get on a plane in AMS without being physically on Netherlands ground ? It really depends on how they interpret the term ""physically present"" and whether they are ""just transiting"" The CBP officer will know where the plane comes from.The notice mentioned this is similar to what the travel ban was for visitors from China. That may provide a hint on the likely procedures. Did they accept non-Chinese passengers from a plane which departed from an airport in China, say Shanghai? Were they able to differentiate between those coming from Shanghai and those transited through Shanghai? I do not know the answer to that."
"@23 & @24:There are 2 issues to consider. 1) Will the order apply to transit pax or not. An international transit passenger does not cross a Schengen border per se but is definitely on Schengen ground. We will have to see if this is clarified or not. Recall the Asian restrictions which initially mostly did not include transit pax but in many cases later did. So wait and see.2) Equally important is where EU originating flights will be allowed to land in the USA. Those limited number of ports are yet to be announced. Will airlines re-route you thru to your final original domestic destination if where they can fly to was not your original? Etc?So given the suddenness and freshness of these restrictions in combination with what has become an American policy habit of shooting first and thinking about the complex details later, we'll have to wait a bit and see."
"Certainly, it's not a blanket ""American policy habit of shooting first."" You can't blame us all for that! Maybe just blame one clueless administration."
"""Maybe just blame one clueless administration.""That's what I meant to convey ;)"
"Just to balance the scale, if I remember, Italy banned all flights from China after two chinese tourist came down with Covid. By then it was too late. This ban was in late January.So on a personal note I agree with the ban. Maybe just too late. Not here to argue. Just my view.Edited: 7:57 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Temporary travel bans are necessary to reduce and hopefully stop the spread. They help people to pay attention to a likely source of spread. Most of the early cases in the U.S. were from people returning home from international travel, from cruise ships, from China, from Italy, and in a surprise for me, from Egpyt.I banned myself from going to Seattle, and definitely would not welcome any visitors from there, for now. It is just a temporary measure."
Hi - I am a US non resident who recently traveled from Seattle to Morocco via Paris (transit only - did not exit the international holding area). On my way back I plan to fly directly to the US from Morocco and not via EU. However will the transit during the travel to Morocco via Paris be registered as an EU visit? Should I wait until the 14 day period has lapsed before attempting to enter the US again?

Charley W - this will apply to you if you visited Hungary within two weeks of your trip to the US.
"Not everything is clear yet. That's partly influencing my opinion that this travel ban is not logical. To have an effect, a country would have to prevent anyone entering it's borders at all, and we all know that some people will still enter illegally.As things appear at the moment, the ban looks as if it will not be easy to enforce, but maybe that will change as things get clarified.Edited: 9:03 am, March 12, 2020 "

Re 41 & 42 - The travel restrictions are new and not all the details are fully clear including the situation in respect of people who start outside the Schengen Zone but connect or are in transit at an airport in the Schengen Zone.I'm afraid it's a case of wait and see - if those connecting at airports like AMA or FRA are included in the banned passenger category then there are a lot more people going to get caught up in this.
"My flight from India to USA with a stop in Paris has been affected as per Delta's message on their flight status portal.""There has been a change or cancellation affecting your trip. If you are not satisfied with this updated itinerary, you may be eligible to change your flight(s) at no extra cost. (Conditions Apply)""So it is affecting transit flights. And they are not even proposing a new itinerary.Edited: 10:47 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Re 44 - The fact that Delta has changed your flight itinerary does not mean it’s in response to the recently announced travel ban, if fact I would be surprised if any airline was responding that quickly.It’s just as likely to be in response to falling volumes of passengers - many airlines are making frequent schedule changes"
"RE 44 - My booking says the same but the flight is not cancelled, the times have changed slightly but not cancelled"
"The airline will probably contact you with an alternate itinerary.They will not.Flight Network might contact you, if they can be bothered."
"Unless you are flying in the next day or two, I think everyone needs to show some patience to see what the actual details regarding the ban will be. Certainly whether those transiting in the EU will be affected is something that has not been specified. Airlines were already scrambling to deal with the coronvirus by dropping flights and combining passengers onto other flights. This announcement is going to make things even worse. You can not possibly re-book tens of thousands of passengers in less than 24 hours.Even the rules regarding US citizens returning right now are very vague. There's been a mention of flights only going to certain airports, but what will the procedures be once those passengers land? Will everyone be screened and those showing any symptoms be tested? Will everyone be required to self-quarantine, even if they show no symptoms but those that do wil be hospitalized or quarantined in some government-established facility?We are scheduled to travel to AMS on 4/6 and return 4/16. The ban would technically be ended by our return according to the timeframe announced last night, but there is no guarantee it won't be extended, so we are watching this situation closing. We have to wait to see what the government does, what our tour company does, and what the airline (DL) does. We are also in th eprocess of trying to contact our trip insurer to see where things stand.Sometimes it's hard to just sit back and wait, but in this case, there's not much else one can do at the moment."

"Unfortunately asking people to self-quarantine won't cut it because there are those DYKWIA's and others that just don't believe that any rules apply to them, no t matter what the circumstances (just look a the hundreds of posts regarding taking over-sized bags we see here). Those that are responsible and show concern for others will do it, but others won't. People constantly go to work when they are sick, even during the flu season which results in thousands of deaths in the US each year. Unfortunately some people just can't financially afford to stay home, so unless there is an economic package to provide relief for these people, I'm afraid I see there being at least somewhat of a failure rate (hard to predict at the moment) for the self-quarantine, which means the virus will still continue to spread."

"It's not a ban on flights. It's a ban on entry by certain people, and a requirement for self-quarantine on arrival by those who are able to travel."
"@Khaled #98""Why I still can book flights to USA through Europe?!!! when I search for a flight through Expedia and other sites""As others have said, flights are still operating. But here is an additional WARNING to anyone booking flights to the USA from or thru Europe, accurate as of now:I have done dummy bookings on Delta and Lufthansa so far, Lufthansa just now and Delta 5 hours ago. In these two examples, their online booking modules HAVE NOT yet been revised to reflect the diminished flight schedules they have publicly announced taking effect within the coming days.I was still able to choose flights a d get to the payment pages for flights/destinations in the USA which they have just announced will no longer be operating. I of course used dates several days after their announced effective as of dates.So heads up.Edited: 10:57 am, March 14, 2020 "
"I just heard back that United Airlines will not refund or let me change my ticket to the Netherlands in mid April. My event there has been cancelled, flights to and from Europe the USA have been cancelled, yet they will not let me even change my ticket. Same goes for items through Expedia. As a consumer I will remember which travel agencies and airlines are the least reasonable and least customer friendly. I understand not being able to take a financial hit, but not letting one postpone an expensive ticket is yet quite another thing. I think all consumers should pay close attention to which airline is responding the best. I know I will!"
United are allowing changes to tickets regardless of fare class for anyone travelling before the end of April. You appear to have been talking to a rogue agent.
"@Yvonne #102""I just heard back that United Airlines will not refund or let me change my ticket to the Netherlands in mid April."" You have been told poppycock or you have misunderstood. Apparently you have not been able to research the matter yourself which is a shame. Umited's website says in part:""Rescheduling a trip: We’re also waiving change fees for all tickets issued on or before March 2 — domestic or international — with original travel dates of March 9 through April 30.""I chose that part assuming you've held your ticket from before March 2. Waivers are in place for those who purchased after that date as well. You owe United an apology here on the forum, don't you think?"
>> flights to and from Europe the USA have been cancelled <<if your flights have been cancelled what reason do they give for not giving a refund? (or have your flights not been cancelled)
"My flight is booked with United Airlines through Expedia. They do provide the option to change the flight but when I try to do so, it says they're unable to change it because it was booked through Expedia. I emailed Expedia and never heard back from them. My flight is on Monday. How do I know if I qualify for a refund/change? I can't even talk to a real human being!!"
"you are going to have to keep trying to get hold of Expedia, they are the only ones that can make changes to the booking"
"You can preclear immigration in Ireland and avoid customs and immigration when landing in the USA. I wonder if that would allow travel from Ireland as you never go landside, always airside"
@108 - Ireland is now included in the ban (from Tuesday) so connections through there will not be possible.
"I managed to finally change my flight with Norwegian on their website... whoever has a flight with them can check their website on which the option of rebooking finally works.Hope all of you will get your money back or rebook, good luck!"
What is the status of your flight? Were you able to travel?
"Nitesh - the reply button just adds your post to the end of the thread so nobody knows who you are asking. If it relates to flights to US via Europe, the answers are in the latter posts on the thread (and no it is not possible)"
All flights that stop in the USA require passengers to go through USA immigration and customs. As you should fly from Schengen area to the USA most probably you will not be allowed to board the flight. Why don't you simply stay at home in this pandemic?
"There is no option to fly from India via Europe to the USA.You can fly (for the time being) via some Middle East hubs. You also have to think, when and how you can go back. The situation is developing and can change rapidly."
If I fly from Cairo and transit in London and arrive in the United States on Monday 3:30PM so before the ban applies. Would I be allowed entry?
"Hi,I have been in Perth for 4 months with a visa.I am flying Monday to Toronto via San Francisco, USA airport.There is a new USA restriction tomorrow for flying from Ireland.Does that affect me please?It says flying from Ireland or Irish resident.Where am I currently resident?"
"These policies were made up by Kushner and Miller with no actual thought about implementation and with the advice of Kushner's brother's FIL who crowdsourced ideas on facebook to his cronies -- so of course it is clear and working like clockwork. No I am not making that up. This is what it looked like for Americans at O'Hare yesterday:https:/…Same at DFE and Dulles etc -- they have managed to create ideal conditions for transmission to as many people as possible. Those actually diagnosed with Corona are in lines standing next to those arriving without such diagnosis. No separation and no attempts to segregate by plane load or in other ways to mitigate further spread.And of course we know that people who are ill are taking tylenol and cold meds and getting on those planes anyway -- there have been reported cases of just that on domestic flights.The policy should not have been announced until they had a plan in place to mitigate exposure. Any of us could come up with several ideas to do this better e.g. use the buses to take people by planeload to segregated area, have the paperwork filled out on the plane, use the temperature measurement devices used elsewhere in the world that screen as people pass by. There must be a dozen ways to keep people in smaller groups or planeload groups and separate out those who are ill. This is what you get when amateurs run policy without any clue how to organize and manage the logistics.Edited: 1:36 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Air (post 115)You would not be impacted by the newly introduced restrictions on flights from the UK to the USA which come into effect at midnight (EST) on Monday but you might have issues trying to get a flight leaving the USA
"Hi all, I've been reading the comments and they have been very useful! I have tried reaching my airline company but so far unsuccessfully. I have a flight from Copenhagen to Cancun via Paris in 2 weeks, and while Mexico hasnt announced any restrictions yet, I am worried for my return flight 9 days later. The return is scheduled with a layover in the US before returning to Schengen. However, I would have been in the Schengen zone in the previous 14 days, so I would be refused boarding on my Cancun, Mexico - US flight? How should I approach this?"
"Yes, assuming you are able to travel to Cancun in the first place, you will not be able to board your return flight."
@Dana #119: you will need to contact your airline and see if the can offer you a non-US return routing or you will need to spend another 5 days in Mexico. You might want to consider cancelling the trip.
"Thank you Steve and Warriorjan! I will contact my airline again. I really prefer cancelling at this point as well, and hope that the airline will offer a refund or a voucher, as it was far from cheap."
"hi!for all of the people that are non US-citizen or residents, and are traveling from EU to any other destination through the US, the US will not allow you to enter and you will not be able to meet your connection flight.I am a salvadoran citizen and my flight was Germany-US -El Salvador, i called the airline and checked the us embassy website, and both confirmed i wont be able to enter the US EVEN if i am only on transit. So if this is your situation, and you want to go home right away from the EU you have to look for a flight that does not include a stop in the US."
"My daughter is currently in the air arriving in Montreal this afternoon. She had been booked from Tanzania with a flight through Zurich so booked her home to Philadelphia even though it is not an approved airport for those arriving from Europe. That flight has been canceled now. I could book her with Air Canada seperately to Philladelphia at least online. If her passport does not have a stamp from anywhere but Tanzania, will she be able to take the flight? The flight they have her changed to goes through Atlanta and then back to Philadelphia and total travel time for just that leg is over 30 hours! There is also a flight to Newark. I am likely going to book that but her luggage may go to Atlanta and then be stuck there with no one to collect it. Any advice would be much appreciated!"
Were you able to get an answer?
ali hAnswer to what question?
@ ali h- I see you are new to posting on the forum and may not realise that any response you post to another person's message does not link to that post and simply ends up at the bottom of the list - you need to identify WHICH post you are referring to. If it is an old one or it is urgent there is no guarantee that the person you want a reply to will even see what you are asking - you may be better off sending the person a PM (private message)
I am transiting through Miami to the Dominican Republic in August . Am I allowed to stay overnight in a hotel at Miami airport?
"Coming from outside the US? You can only enter is you are a citizen here. 1 day, 1 hour, no difference."
PathfinderMore information is required for an accurate answer - where are you starting from and what passport do you hold.
"Hello, im looking for some clarification. Im planning to buy a ticket from Kiev, Ukraine to Seattle, USA. There is 1h layover in Germany, Frankfurt airport. Does this mean im physically presenting myself in Shengen area or it does not matter?"
"If the travel is on one ticket, you can stay airside and not enter the Schengen area."
When are you planning to fly. Be aware of the restrictions for passengers listed on the CDC website:https:/…from-other-countries.html
Actually im flying from Lithuania to Ukraine(gonna spend 14 days there to pass Schengen ban). Then my trip would be Kiev- Frankfurt/Frankfurt-Dulles(both these flights are operated by Lufthansa and Dulles- Seattle. So my biggest concern is that 1h layover in Frankfurt. But I dont need to change airlines or check in baggage.
"I believe the ban applies to transit passengers as well, so you may not be able to board your connecting flight in Frankfurt."
"You can't enter USA. I have same situation. I'm in Turkey now, which not included in the ban. But I'm traveling to USA transiting from Germany. I was worried and started research. I found out here : https:/…1580226297.htmPress USA on the map. It states: Published 08.06.20201. Passengers who have transited or have been in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China (People's Rep.), Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland or in the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), in the past 14 days are not allowed to enter the USA.It clearly says about transit flights as well. So I'm not gonna risk. Will get new direct tickets."
