At this time you can only do an air side transit through HK airport. You cannot transit on separate tickets. And there are other restrictions.
You could find out more information from Cathay Pacific:https://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_LK/trave…At the moment Cathay Pacific has suspended the service between Hong Kong and Colombo.
