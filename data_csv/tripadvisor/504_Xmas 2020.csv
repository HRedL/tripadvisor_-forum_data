"Due to arrive end of November for 3 weeks holiday, am in limbo to carry on paying for the holiday or just cancel it with everything that's gone on!! What's your thoughts/plans.Thanks"
Avoid any bookings to Goa this year..most probably foreigners wont be allowed to travel to India as preventative measures.
"Well I always book as soon as I get back. So my flights were booked with Tui At the beginning February.. Mainly because I wanted the direct flight. I'm not really expecting to go at the end of December, But I still have my fingers and legs crossed it may happen. I would hate to miss our 24th visit to Goa, it's like a fix for me !!! BOB …..."
"It would all depend on which company you booked with. We too have booked a 3 week holiday departing UK the end of November returning to UK a week or so before Christmas.We've booked with TUI. Our method of payment was pay £250.oo on booking which was half of the deposit, we then paid the second half of the deposit (another £250) during the current lockdown. We owe them nearly another 3K to be paid in early September.If I'd chose NOT to go on holiday before the second half of the deposit was due, TUI would still have chased me for the second half of the deposit. I think it's in the small print.My worry is that in September the FCO state that it's safe (enough) to travel but reliable posters on this forum paint a different picture. If extra precautions were implemented by the Indian Government, let's say on arrival at Goa Airport, checking temperatures etc and as a result we were placed in quarantine awaiting Corona Test (which had to be paid for), the test proves negative but we'd still have to cough up (no pun intended) the money for the quarantine. I'd suggest that TUI would NOT say ""This is unacceptable we'll allow everyone to re-book their holidays"" in the same way as if the Indian Government enforced holiday makers to carry Yellow Fever Certificates . TUI would just notify everyone that with immediate effect holiday makers will undergo tests at Goa Airport.In the past I amended a holiday with TUI - changing my hotel from De Alturas in Candolim to CSM at Baga, a simple matter of amending the hotel name on the computer one would think? Yes, but TUI charged me £100.oo for the privilege. I'd like to know what is the shortest time in advance that one can amend their holiday, obviously NOT the day before.Come the 3rd of September I might just cut my losses and loose the £500.oo. Of course if I did that and FCO stated it was unsafe to travel in September TUI would say, ""That's September, you're NOT going until November and it might be safe then"", agreed and FCO might say in November that it's still unsafe, then I'd be able to get a full refund (£500.oo + £3K) in cash or be credited for another holiday.If TUI went bust, I'd get a full refund.My holiday pattern is much the same as Triumph Ned, Two holidays to Goa, one before Christmas, one in February, then many holidays throughout the rest of the year including 4 holidays a year to Krakow our favourite destination. I'd be sorry to see TUI go out of business, I'm NOT a great fan of theirs; they seem to be too big and corporate and lack that personal touch but I wouldn't want to see them go to the wall."
"We have paid for our Qtar flights and half our hotel cost for our November trip, so obviously hoping it will happen. But assuming the worst, if Qatar say we can't fly, we should get a refund. How easy it would be to get the money back from the hotel is another matter all together!I'm with you.MMS, and don't want to see Tui go under. We do have one holiday still booked with them, in June 2021 and might yet end up using them for another Goa trip in the future. It won't benefit anyone if one more travel company goes bust."
"Triumphed we have also booked and paid for our Qatar flights for nov ,, I really can’t see it happening now ,,hopefully get a refund ,,I haven’t sent the money over for our hotel ,,don’t no what to do about that ,we are booked in but not sent deposit,,haven’t had a request for it ,so probably I will wait a while longer and enquire in a couple of months"
"Lolly, I wouldn't worry about the hotel deposits at the moment, most are not functioning at the moment & as soon as they are given any indication they can operate, they will contact you. However I know a number of guest houses demanding deposits of 50% and above for all bookings next season, they should at the moment be ignored, even if you lose your provisional bookings there will be plenty of other options available."
"You won't be going to Goa this year, we are faced with a Global Pandemic whose reprecussions will be life changing & far reaching until such time as a suitable vaccine is found, you won't be going to Goa, it really is that simple."
"Totally agree BS64, sad to say; best to keep your money in your pocket."
"Bs64 I’m certain we are all aware of what’s happening in the world at the moment ,,as I said ,,I can’t see us getting to goa in November..I was talking about that triumphned,myself and other people have booked and fully paid for flights ect ,,and hopefully get refunds."
"Scottishgrass yes I agree I’m not going to send any money for hotel at all ,,we have stayed at this particular hotel for a few years now,,so I will.email them in a few months ."
"Mzungu post 3 ...We love Krakow too.Having lost one city break next month .We have decided to take the plunge and booked 5 nights in Krakow for next May 2021..Paid the flights on my credit card and booked with Wizz Air..2 seats 1 large hold case all for the price of just under £90..Booking . com apartment in our favourite area Fully refundable up to 14 days before we go, pay on arrival £147..A little bonus incase our goa in jan/feb don't go ahead..I think the flight price is a mega bargain and when the boarders open im sure fares will only be going up ???"
"Hi we have also booked with Qatar but are leaving it a couple of months to see what the Indian government has to say about opening up Goa. We have paid for a our flights in full, but guest house where we stay we do not have to pay till we get there. All the people in Goa need us the tourist to survive there in a terrible situation, no hand outs there for the people. Be positive Christmas a long way of."
"Tourism globally will go ahead in the next 3 months obviously there will be restrictions and regulations I’m sure but it will happen this year, only today Italy have announced its opening borders for tourism in June and other countries will follow a vaccine will be introduced quicker than what you think so don’t worry if you have booked for goa in November and December you will be sunning it up with a honey bee in your hand, have hope everyone positive thinking needed"
"How do you know all that gazza? About a vaccine? Gobal tourism in 3 months? Have you seen the situation in other parts of India? Mumbai for instance? India is the worst affected place in Asia.Edited: 2:39 pm, May 16, 2020 "
It will be gone as quick as it came trust me
Cheers all still going to pay it off hoping for the best
I can’t see any safe travel until we have a vaccine maybe 2021
Me neither LindyCu at the earliest and then with no insurance for it. This is not for the short term
"The thing is... -Going anywhere (Goa, France, Canada, or even back to your home country), please take into account that a number of tourists / locals may get covid-19 FROM being in quarantine! Filter this in.. Quite scary to be honest.. -In this case, India... mandatory quarantine? Ok..is it clean / moderate / free / expensive.. filter this in as well..  2 weeks in India + they always ask you to isolate yourself for another 2 weeks.. yeah? ==Start your Holiday== When we go back home, ANOTHER quarantine?2 weeks + they always ask you to isolate yourself for another 2 weeks.. yeah? Dang... I don't see myself doing all this."
"Testing systems at the moment. First up the test is rupees 2,000 and the state govt has announced everyone including goans will be charged. People arriving by train yesterday were furious by this decision. Test results take around six hours.If your goan and negative it's home isolation if you have a family home, if your out of state it's an army camp if negative, a medical facility if positive, both will be dormitory type accommodation, both basic, charges are being reviewed by the state govt and non goans will likely have to pay. This is too discourage people traveling for tourism.Exceptions to quarantine are allowed to interstate commercial goods crews, but if one is positive, the whole crew is quarantined, with negatives following above procedures.Testing is expected for all international passengers with or without home medical certificates stating their clear.Standard operating procedures are being considered for post monsoon, they may include.Ten bed rule on shacks being enforced.Limiting standard shacks to maximum 20 covers per shack.Face masks to be worn by all, currently 11,000 fined for not wearing masks in public or in or on vehicles of all types during last three weeks in goa.Military personal on beaches to support police enforcement of the rules.No entry of foreigners without medical insurance cover, including cover for the virus.Staff to wear ppe in all bars, shacks, restaurants & hotels, currently staff in shops mostly operating in that manner already, with masks & gloves.No water sports due to social distancing. Boat trip & cruises number cut by 50%, local bus service passenger numbers reduced, no double seating, no standing.Taxi numbers reduced to driver & two passengers, tut tuts the same.Bar & restaurants numbers very limited in line with shacks, limited tables on the street & limited (if any types of entertainment) including live sport.Sporting events numbers limited if not played behind closed doors.Swimming pools in hotels & complexes will be reviewed, possible closed long-term, aĺl currently closed.Needless to say there will protests from owners about these restrictions but as currently they earn nothing, then maybe by increasing prices they may earn something. One thing I think I can realistically forecast, season 2020/21 won't be normal.Edited: 2:13 am, May 17, 2020 "
"Oh dear, what a state of affairs Scottish, no holidays to India for a long while then"
No entry to foreigners without medical cover means nobody will be able to go thats all there is to it
"If they operate these suggestions as sop, I know a number of people who stay long-term who won't be here, as they gamble with no insurance."
"Scottish....... I literally got a headache reading your post, thinking about all the lost businesses!!!"
Just spoke to friend who owns a restaurant in Candolim and Goa is now a red zone with 17 cases of virus
So everyone in bar or restaurant will need to wear a mask? So how do you eat or drink? Are you allowed to make a hole in your mask?
"Ned that's the issue, if we have to wear them when travelling or shopping, why don't they get worn in restaurants, some would say simply don't open bars & restaurants, life over profits, others on the coastal belt will cry, we can't earn a living, we will lose our jobs.They are currently at govt level having to devise a system, where sooner rather than later tourism resumes, but many not involved in tourism will cry fowl, needless to say, it will end up in the courts, as usual.One thing is clear, the majority in goa are currently getting on with some form of life, and most abiding by the rules, I'm not sure how long that attitude can last, or how long curfews will be accepted."
"""Cheers all still going to pay it off hoping for the best""Could be the best idea morley7819 or read up on your terms and conditions and find out what happens if you do stop paying, often the payment plans are with a credit company not the company you booked with and stopping payment can trigger heavy charges or even having to pay the full cost immediately"
"we are going on the 7th december for 2 weeks and i believe things will have eased abit by the time december comes about ,6 months away,id carrie on paying it as worse case scenario you will get a refund or change the dates till a time that will suit you.regards les"
"If you are paying by direct debit through tui you can amend this to pay the final balance 8 weeks before, this will give you more time to make the decision to go or not, no charge for this."
"morley7819No problem with Goa regarding Covid-19, still check with the current situation at the time of booking..."
I'm an Indian and live in Delhi and I am certainly hoping to visit in December 2020. I missed going in December 2019 and really craving the Goa fun....certainly hope things will be up and running. Indians are already trying to get to Goa from other states...the State government is trying to get the few trains running to not stop in Goa for fear of tourists coming in!
