"i just heard this latest development on sky news:the first person to contract the flu virus without a link to mexico has just been discovered in spain.this means that the virus has the ability to jump from human to human and is likely to lift the pandemic alert from level 4 to level 5.we're due to travel on 1st july and this is starting to look less likely. GUTTEDplease, please make it all go away!!mark"
"It is an interesting piece of news, certainly. However I don't understand this comment:""this means that the virus has the ability to jump from human to human and is likely to lift the pandemic alert from level 4 to level 5.""It's been clear for some time that it's been jumping from human to human, which is one of the key new points involved, here. From the beginning it was reported that none of the known victims had any contact with pigs, for example. It would also be good to have a link to substantiate a claim on the latter point, as without that, it would seem just conjecture on the part of a non-expert. (I mean unless you're with the WHO or something!)Steve"
"Mark,Level 4 already signifies human to human transmission, level 5 signifies widespread human to human transmission.As Steve said, human to human transmission has already been well documented.I would be interested in the link to the story you mention if you have it though.t"
"I'm not at all familiar with sky news but a guess and some searching says this is the story the OP read about.…sky.com/skynews/…He said the WHO is moving closer to raising its pandemic alert to phase 5, indicating widespread human-to-human transmission."
" hope this explains itThe WHO have not been able to confirm human-human in mex due to the lack of info and testing being done there. That it why they have just sent a task force to find out more in mex, by tracing source and ruling out other reasons for spread. so the 1st country confirmed with human -human is in US and now Spain is the second thus upgrade to 5 will now take place.It all just formal stuff yes they did already know this info but on paper the cirteria was not yet methope this helps"
"Last night World New Tonight with Charlie Gibson reported the start was most likely a little boy playing near a Smithfield Ham manufacturing plant in a small town a ways (sorry-I forgot) from Mexico City.They interviewed workers who stated ""conditions very bad"" - possibly referring to sanitation. The whole family got sick, are fine now. That was approx. a month ago."
"Thanks for the helpful responses.Cormac, there are stories out now about ""patient zero,"" for example, this one on CNN this morning:cnn.com/2009/…index.htmlActually the boy's own personal recovery is a nice glimmer in all this gloomy situation...Steve"
"FWIW, there's not the causual connection suggested in the OP, but there are (perhaps not surprisingly) articles saying that WHO _might_ raise the alert level to 5. Here is one, for example:www.healthzone.ca/health/article/626348But then there were reports after they raised it to 4 on Monday that they might raise it again to 5 on Tuesday, as well, and that didn't happen. So it may be kind of like border closing reports, you know: sure, of course, that _might_ happen, just as the situation _might_ get much worse, in various countries, or it _might_ get much better and the level _might_ be then lowered to 3 again, and so on.Unfortunately I think a lot of people tend to take those _mights_ and turn them into pretty much done deals, in their minds -- things that are inevitable. And that seems to just feed people's fears and things start to spin out of control in terms of our grasp on the situation. IMO.Steve "
"Well they have apparently raised it to level 5 now:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30398682/The WHO links have not yet been updated to reflect this, but may of course be updated any moment:who.int/csr/…index.htmlwww.who.int/csr/don/2009_04_29/en/index.htmlSteve"
