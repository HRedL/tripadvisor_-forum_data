"Hi,I am in Greece and as all countries are following the WHO step by step to avoid catastrophic human killer disease,Wizzair refuse to cancel my ticket from GR to UK which is due tomorrow and said if i cancel i will lose all the ticket price,Today our Govt closed parks and supermarkets and crowded places and recommend to avoid travels or we will be responsible if we transmit the virus and other countries like Canada can prosecute you if you do not stay 14 days at home and if you transfer the disease you can be sued by criminal offense.trip to UK is 4 days , was made before the pandemic, how come to isolate 14 days ? then retake flight back to ATH and maybe be a virus donor or receiver, why risk it ? the company care for money not our health as Human.Now wizzair is forcing people to use there ticket and be at risk to take the virus or transmitted to other. Un-human behaviour, where they are helping in Spreading the Virus and challenge people decision in this Catastrophic outrage of the Virus.I will never use this Airline, you want to steal my money take it, but i won't help you in such a crime.One day i think companies like Wizzair will be prosecuted for such actions and forcing people to not obey there Govt. and WHO recommendation , but for them they go bankrupt and runaway from there crime.i hope the EU will force this company to change the policies. and will prosecute the owners of this company.what do you think other readers here about such a situation to force people to fly and avoid Government and WHO Recommendation where criminal offences can get us now?Time to make Money or be human? Wizzair want to force me to fly or i loose my money, i prefer to loose my money vs putting people life at risk."
It's a matter for your travel insurance. They're doing what every other airline is doing so if you want to boycot this practice you'll never be flying again.
"Nobody is forcing you to fly. If Wizzair is still operating the flight, there will probably be people only too willing to return home to the UK. It may be their last chance.The choice is yours. Accept that you will not get a full refund if you cancel, or travel just because you have paid the fare. If you have a non-refundable ticket you will not get a refund just because you choose not to travel, even if you do so for ethical reasons. The current pandemic was unforeseeable and even if you had travel insurance you may not be covered. There are many thousands of people in the same situation, some of whom will have lost far more than you. Wizzair have done nothing wrong and it is certainly not a crime. They are not making money out of this situation and like many other much larger airlines will be lucky if they survive."
How are they forcing people? Are they coming to their homes and threatening them with a weapon?
They're doing what every other airline is doing...Many other airlines are allowing changes without penalty. So is Wizzair allowing this?
"Please think rationallt. Wizz Air still operation the flight doesn't mean you must fly. It may be operating because British people need to leave Greece and get home to the UK.It will mean that by being sensible and not flying and exposing yourself to other ways of catching you loose money on you ticket, but there are in the very sad current sitation worse situations to be in. If you are able to message the airline that you won't fly, then som other passenger needing to get to the UK could use you seat - even if no refund ensues. At least you will have done the right thing.SWT"
"I look at things differently. Once I book a flight, the money is gone whether I fly or not. By not flying Iâ€™m probably avoiding a lot of expenses. Life is easier if rather than becoming a raving zealot, you look for the positives even when things are darkest."
Forcing people by not giving them refund and leave low income people who bought light packages to loose there money or fly.This is forcing.Why other airline all changes and rebooking are available at no fees.
"What other airlines is doing this ? All major airline changes and refund, i have 3 tickets with KLM and Air france i was able to change then. Cancel and they gave me full refund."
"@ThanksSocialSecurity , wizzair is not allowing to change or cancel like other airlines, unless the govt. Block or cancel the flight. Scammer airline who count on low budget people to loose there money in such epidemic situation."
"I have read some melodramatic rubbish in my time, and that is up with the best.""Low income""? You were able to pay for a four-day trip from Greece to the UK and several other trips besides. Don't insult people who can barely afford to live.Edited: 3:07 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"'Forcing people by not giving them refund and leave low income people who bought light packages to loose there money or fly. This is forcing.' No it isn't, but I don't think you're interested in a discussion of contract law right now.'i hope the EU will force this company to change the policies. and will prosecute the owners of this company.' Neither of these things will happen.'Wizzair want to force me to fly or i loose my money, i prefer to loose my money vs putting people life at risk.' The first isn't accurate although true in that if you don't use the ticket you won't be refunded, and the second is a wise decision.Wizz Air have not 'forced' you to do anything. Like millions of others you're going to take a financial hit and it's painful. You have every right to say ow that hurts and dislike having to pay for something you're not going to use, but the rest is a bit OTT."
This is what I don't understand when seeing all the posters saying they cannot afford to lose the (prepaid) money. If something is already paid the money is spent already. And they obviously could afford it.
"""What other airlines is doing this ?""I was referring to the offer of a refund when flight isn't cancelled since this is what you mentioned."
you have not mentioned your travel insurance - have you chosen to self-insure?
"OP, as others have already pointed out - nobody is forcing you to fly.Just because you bought something doesn't mean you have to use it.Have you really never bought something that you ended up not using? That jacket that looked so great in the shop but didn't really suit you? That piece of meat or tub of salad that ended up sitting at the back of the fridge, unloved and forgotten? That kitchen gadget that didn't quite do what the advert said it would do, and that just became a dust catcher until you finally threw it out?If you don't fly you get four days of your life back, and you end up not spending money you would otherwise have spent. Don't go throwing good money after bad - this would just be foolish."
>>Forcing people by not giving them refund and leave low income people who bought light packages to loose there money or fly. This is forcing.<<No it's not. It's just you having a whinge
"@wirewiper did i say i was the one on low income ? i am saying this as i feel it is not right to steal their money, and yes i have more flights as my work pay it, KLM / AF canceled them and full refund them. next time please read or ask to get explanation, don't rule out without clarifications.Greece from Monday 23/03/2020 is complete lockdown and wizzair website have disabled there complaint form, there email is bouncing back and there phone customer support said they cannot do anything, why Wizzair not accepting complaints and refunding people who became on lockdown or there life is at risk?Edited: 9:07 am, March 23, 2020 "
"""why Wizzair not accepting complaints and refunding people who became on lockdown or there life is at risk?""They are not refunding because they don't have to. Be nice if they did but it's not like it's their decision to close borders. And again, they're no different from any other airline in this respect."
"@Davidsa007: How will not flying make you lose money? Will somehow magically money disappear out of your pocket/bank account if you do not fly?You have already paid. So the money is lost. This is a ""sunk cost"". What matter is how to avoid further costs, and currently that means: Stay at home."

"I agree with what everyone else is saying ( esp Post 10 in which wirewiper says ""..I have read some melodramatic rubbish in my time, and that is up with the best."" ). You are expecting too much from a low cost airline David - if the flights are still operating they have absolutely NO obligation to compensate you for your personal ""disinclination to travel"" because quarantine restriction affecting you as an individual make the journey a bit pointless Also - you seem to have ignored comments about this being a matter for your insurers not the airline. Does this mean that you don't have any by any chance? If so then this particular loss is totally down to you I am afraid"
">>> @wirewiper did i say i was the one on low income ? <<<@Davidsa007: you said, quote: ""Forcing people by not giving them refund and leave low income people who bought light packages to loose there money or fly.""I appreciate that English is not your first language, but nowhere in that statement do you make it clear you are not referring to yourself.I stand by what I said earlier. Melodramatic rubbish."
'i am saying this as i feel it is not right to steal their money' Oy. What you 'feel' isn't the basis for the contract agreed. Doesn't matter as Wizz Air has not 'stolen' any money.'why Wizzair not accepting complaints and refunding people who became on lockdown or there life is at risk?' What would be the point of Wizz Air paying staff to receive phone calls complaining about things that cannot be changed? As well 'refunding people who became on lockdown or there life is at risk' isn't the company's business model.You chose a low cost carrier and agreed to their terms. Unless the fare from ATH to London was several hundred euro then the loss is very small compared to what others are facing.
"The reality is that we live in a capitalist system. Like it or not. The reality is that airlines exist to make a profit. I just dont get why people are surprised when they behave this way, especially at a time when they are fighting to survive.If every airline were to refund every ticket at a time like this many would fold right now. Im not justifying what is happening, just trying to understand it."
"I've seen a lot of good sense in this thread. Unfortunately, none of it is from the OP."
"Hi there,Totally agree with you. I'm Hungarian, but living in the UK, as a resident. I was meant to fly home to see my family for the Easter break, with my 2 kids, and my husband was supoosed to follow last Friday due to work, then fly back this Monday, and we were supposed to come back yesterday. All flights were cancelled, except for the ones we were meant to be taking(looks like until today, as the airport is closed from 12am this morning for a passangers). We couldn't call the airline, and was only able to submit a request 14th April, as their contact system was down. They came back to me with law paragraphs, stating I'm not elegible for a refund, as my flights were operating. This is a global crisis, we've been advised not to travel, and I would have been put to qurantine for almost the entire journey, putting ourselves, our families and other travellers at risk, given the UK is not the safest place at the moment. They haven't even offered to re-schedule for free, when other airlines we have bookings with for much later in the year, did ages ago. I feel robbed, it wasn't even cheap, but I care less about the money, than the treatment they are giving me after 10 years, and also being a member of their 'club'."
"No, they are not..."
"WizzAir is an unscrupulous airline.They locked me and my family in the aircraft in Luton for 5 hours, they knew the flight was cancelled but they sequestrated us in the plane without any food or water until closing time of their offices.Then they let their employees and check in desk leave through the back door putting strain on the then Azzura check in desk who had to deal with over 100 angry people who were refused compensation.We were so traumatized and never received any justice for being locked in WizzAir aircraft with other fellow passengers without any food or water for almost 5 hours."
