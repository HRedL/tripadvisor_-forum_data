Those are the statistics that triggered the France 14 day isolation on return. Where is Greece in comparison?
"Ironically, I've only just managed to find this out. My source is for latest data available at 2 August 2020.Website is www.ecdc.europa.eu.Greece figure per 100,000 shows 5.6. This is based on a 14 day analysis at 2 August though.Even with the recent rise in cases in Greece, I think it would take a dramatic escalation In Greece for the UK to cast its quarantine eyes on the country.So, for now, with 28 days to go till our flight, I will remain, as ever, cautiously optimistic."
"Going by the average in the last 7 days, around 18"
"Current data is under this link: https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaECDC posts 14-day cumulative number/100 000, not 7-day as the UKEdited: 5:28 am, August 14, 2020 "

So am I right in saying that France was triggered at 32.1 and Greece is currently 17.2?
"Yes, but that's over a 14-day period. I think in a 7-day period the numbers are higher due to the recent spikes both in France and Greece."
I was searching for this too this morning and could only find the info up until the 2nd August too. It seems to have updated now though.Useful info.
I believe they use the 14-day figure for quarantine decisions?
"so based on working it out in my head with a pop 10,467,000 on this weeks Greece total of 1257 new cases it would be around 24.0 if that rate were to continue for another week?"
"The data in 3 shows cumulative cases per 100000 over the last 14 days, which you would expect to be roughly double the cumulative 7 day figures where there is no spike in cases. The 7 day figure will always be less than the 14 day figure because they represent the total number of cases in the given period, not the mean number per day.So whereas the UK 14 day figure is 18.5 in the list, the 7 day figure is approximately 9: https:/…united-kingdom-coronavirus-cases.html"
yes I just worked out the week's figure for Greece Steve which would have been 12.0 and if the same figures next week it will double or go up if it gets worse
">>>The 7 day figure will always be less than the 14 day figure because they represent the total number of cases in the given period, not the mean number per day.Of course, I meant higher than the 14-day numbers simply divided by 2. The spikes in Greece and France occurred in the last week but are being ""diluted"" by earlier lower numbers."
"Yes, it's a shame different agencies don't all use the same baseline for their figures!"
"I go in less than a week, I really can’t see that the U.K. gov won’t put a quarantine in place in Greece now"
"A major Swedish travel organizer (Vingresor) is cancelling all flights to Greece from Aug 17th, following the requirement for travellers to Greece to present a health certificate as a condition for entry. As such a certificate costs some EUR 200 p.p. one can expect a major reduction in the number of visitors to Greece."
"For those of you who like stats, take a look at this page: https:/…weekly_surveillance_summary"
"In a slightly selfish sense, I don't mind if the UK government slaps a quarantine on returning to the UK as I live alone and work from home already. My concern is either government blocking travel entirely, which doesn't seem likely at this stage?I saw on another thread that the number of Greek tourists is expected to drop towards the end of August, the question is will that have a marked effect on cases and how quickly would things improve I wonder. (I'm due to travel 2nd Sept).Still keeping everything crossed..."
