I'm looking online and it appears that it may be over an hour to get teamlab bordless museum via the metro. Is this right? I just want to plan accordingly. Is there a metro app that helps navigate the city? Thank you!
It’s about 50 minutes. We tend to switch between Google maps and the official app: https:/…index.html
It's 25 minutes if you take the direct Saikyo/Rinkai Line from Shinjuku to Tokyo Teleport. It's a 3-4 minutes walk from Tokyo Teleport Station.
"Don't use the metro/subway.From Shinjuku - very quick on the direct line to Tokyo Teleport station. From the station (when I took people there in January) I would have probably said an easy 10 minutes, but it's not far from the station to the site."

Ginza Line to Shinbashi and the Yurikamome Line to Aomi.
"Yes, you should take either JR Saikyo/Rinkai Line or Yurikamome Line to visit Odaiba. There is no Subway going to Odaiba, the Artificial Island."
Tokyo Metro's Yurakucho Line trains go to Odaiba.
Yurakucho Line doesn't go close to teamlabBorderless so is not a useful suggestion/comment. 3.5 km is non-trivial.
Its Closing on Feb 29th due to the coronavirus.
