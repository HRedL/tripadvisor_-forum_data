"at this hot time of year, is it advisable to use bug spray when visiting Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville?"
"No. (At least if you mean: do I need to protect myself against disease-carrying mosquitos like in tropical countries?)But even if you want to protect against annoying bugs in general, there are very few of them in these cities. Maybe in Sevilla along the river at dusk... but I never really noticed."
"There are mosquitoes , not as an epidemic but they do exist so if you attract them (fortunately for me they dn't like my blood) you should use some sort of repellent.As for other ""bugs"" like ants or cockroaches, they also exist an, again, not as an epidemic but a wondering cockroaches can fly in through the window and in some places you might encounter a few ""bugs"" (especially in the old city). In which case go the nearby store and buy what you need."
"Wow! I've never seen ""flying"" cockroaches that come through the window in Barcelona. I've seen them in tropical countries, but never here."
"No, you do not need any bug spray. I was in all three cities earlier this month. The only issue I had with pests (flies) was while waiting for transportation at Seville's Plaza de Espana. I guess because of all the food vendors around, flies were attracted."
I never use a bug spray in those cities.
