"Sallyhuang, I recommend you to visit the nearest DGMM / Directorate General of Migration Management or Göç İdairesi Genel Müdürlüğü for more information and clarity. It is not police office which deals with the residency permit but now with DGMM. Better to be accompanied with one of your Turkish friends or somebody who speaks Turkish fluently - for translation and just in case. Further, bring the print out of your residency permit online application as well so the officer will be able to provide the answer on your queries. In previous years it was legal to stay in Turkey after the visa expiry date as long as the person carried the print out of residency permit application appointment date. I am not sure about recent law to obtain residency permit. Again as I mentioned above: pay your visit to DGMM."
"You should get your appointment date within 1-2 weeks. The waiting time for an appointment in Istanbul is currently three months. Then it'll be at least a month after the appointment until you get the residency card. Be warned. You're legally allowed to stay but if you need to leave before you get the card, you may face a fine."
Have to say I don't recommend going to any office. They won't be able to tell you anything different. Just wait for your appointment date to show up.
Why does coronavirus impact you leaving the country?
"Have correct, true, and accurate documentation for residency permit application, then I wish you good luck!"

Great! Good luck. :)
Carry a print out copy of your appointment confirmation with you just in case you need proof you applied before your visa expires. To ensure that your application goes without a hitch make sure you have all the documentation required.Check out Doc Martins Surgery for Expats as he collates all the information for those applying. He keeps everything up to date and is perhaps more reliable than this a mainly tourist/traveller forum. There is also a Facebook group. Read through the files before asking particular questions (if needed)https:/…
"Happy to hear the news, keep us updated in the process please! Meanwhile enjoy your time in Turkey."
How long did it take for you to get the appointment? And which date did you get the appointment for?
