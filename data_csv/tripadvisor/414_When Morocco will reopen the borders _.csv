We are wondering when Morocco will reopen the borders for international flights.

Ryanair has its first flight scheduled to start on the 11th July. Whether it actually goes ahead is another matter. Let's see.
"Easyjet are showing flight available from the 25th of July, fingers crossed as we fly on sept the 6th"
"Just read now that the borders of Morocco will reopen on 14 July after midnight I will write more details once I have ""government news"""
"Sorry, but not true for tourists.Please refer to the Covid-19 Master Thread at https:/…107180277"
"Yes, you are right just realize that it's only for the Moroccan abord and foreigners resident in Morocco.I'm sorry for the misunderstanding."
"Hi,My partner has Moroccan passport but he is a Dutch citizen. Do you think he will be able to flight back? He's been stocked in Morocco since March.. t"
"Simple answer, yes. The news report at https:/… states, ""Moroccans residing abroad as well as foreigners residing in Morocco will also be able to leave Morocco at the end of their stay through air and maritime means.""Sounds like he is a Moroccan citizen who also has Dutch citizenship. If he has Dutch residency he should already have been allowed to leave, see post #256 on the Covid-19 Master Thread at https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…"
"Hi Tim, when do you think we are we going to hear about foreign tourist?I am hoping my holiday on the 20th of July is cancelled so I can request a refund from my travel company On the Beach."
Just spoke to my holiday company and they have said easyjet will be flying on the 15th july
"If your travel plan is cancelled the travel agent who sold you the airline tickets should inform you by email of the flight status and if the flight is cancelled you will be offered a refund, but some dodgy operators are only offering compensation vouchers which is illegal, they are obliged to offer a cash refund if that is what you want.At the moment I too am waiting for an Easyjet refund which they say will take up to 90 days because of the huge numbers of claims being processed. Confirmation of this information is revealed on page 14 of today's Daily Express by ""the consumer champion"" Dean Dunham.If you have problems obtaining your refund you can take your complaint to The Competition and Markets Authority via gov.uk.cma or take your case to the Small Claims Court, but this elevation should not be necessary as the rules on refunds are now becoming more widely known and accepted.Most important is that you must NOT cancel your holiday yourself if you want your money back, the airline must inform you or your travel agent that the the flight is cancelled."
"I want to add to Kaptain's good advice , that for US passengers ...""The refund/reservation requirement for airlines does not apply to tickets booked through online travel agencies, travel agents, or other third-party agents. However, these agents are free to apply the same or similar procedures to provide equivalent or similar customer service.""Another good reason to try and book direct when ever possible. As a booking agent can use their Terms Of Service (TOS) to regulate their policies."
The 15th is for Moroccan citazens only I believe. Tourists Id imagine will then be after that.
"Even if Morocco's borders are opened to normal ""bona fide"" tourists in the near future, there is always the possibility that a ""spike"" of Corona virus could appear in locations where the disease was thought to have been eradicated, this has now happened in a few locations in Spain and the Scottish Government have revised their policy of forcing all passengers returning from these locations to be quarantined for two weeks.This virus does not seem to be diminishing anytime fast, so the best plan is to stay at home until the situation becomes clearer, or a safe and reliable vaccination becomes available. It's better to skip your annual Morocco holiday in order to remain fit and healthy, there is always next year to look forward to which is what I'm planning to do."
"be very careful, Ryanair and Easyjet are not allowed to fly into Morocco for the forseeable future. They are leaving it to the last minute to cancel flights even though they know they wont be flying weeks in advance. If you look at Ryanair Travel Advice for other countries it says All Flights to Morocco are suspended. However, on their website they are still selling 2nd August Stanstead to Fes!"
"Well it's worse than that actually as Ryanair are still selling flights from London to Marrakech from July 15th onward, as far as I can tell they do not tell you that you can only take this flight if you Moroccan citizen or residentI have no idea if they will refund nonMoroccans who purchase these flights - they may claim that the flights are going so it's not their problem"
"This is my worry with Ryanair. They had a scheduled flight to Agadir today which shows cancelled. They also have a scheduled flight next week on the 18th July and one before that to Marakesh this Thursday, both showing as on schedule. I strongly suspect these will not go ahead, and I suspect they know too.It seems to me they will only cancel at the last second to avoid paying refund for people who have booked months in advance. Any idea how much advance notice they must give for flight cancellation or can they do it just minutes before the flight time?Seems a total scam to me."
"If the flight is cancelled then they have to refund, I think the flights from 15th onward will go as Moroccan citizens/residents can fly the issue here is that the flights may actually go but nonMoroccans cannot fly - I don't know if you get a refund in that case, may vary from airline to airline"

"@nibrika: that's the scam Wizz Air, one of the low cost airlines in Europe used. People couldn't fly due to restrictions, but the planes still flew as then the airline could avoid having to refund tickets.From wired.com link below, ""By resuming travel, airline companies will avoid adding to their already costly bill of customer refunds for cancelled flights. Even if their planes were completely empty, companies would not be legally required to refund passengers the cost of their ticket if their flight were to go ahead, in spite of government guidance.""Report from 20 May (seven weeks ago): https:/…ryanair-refunds-coronavirus-flightsThere is a way to thwart that. Turn up for the flight and you will either be turned away by the arline in which case they HAVE to refund you, or they let you board and you then take your chances with arrivals in Morocco. But you would certainly have to have the Covid-19 test within 48 hours of the flight which would be a challenge to get with the slow processing of tests in the UK."
"The ONLY airlines currently able to fly into or from Morocco are Royal Air Maroc and Air Arabia. Ryanair, Easyjet and other airlines are not able to undertake any scheduled flights to/from Morocco.Refer to post #270 on the Covid-19 Master Thread at https:/…107224822"
