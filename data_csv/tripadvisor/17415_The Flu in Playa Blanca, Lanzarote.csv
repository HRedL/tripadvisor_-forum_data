Has the Flu epidemic reached Playa Blanca yet.? We are due to fly out there on 24th January and wonder what the risks are of picking it up at the Hotel.
You will have more risk picking it up on the plane.
is this a wind up??
I have to ask what you would do if the answer was yes?
As I am in my 80's I would cancel the holiday.
"Get the flu vaccination, anyone over 60 should get it annually as a matter of course."
"Margo, I understand your concern, but I am sure you are aware of this but neither your holiday company or your insurer would refund your holiday on the premise that you ""might"" get the flu.if you are prepared to lose all the money you have spent on the holiday, it's your choice to cancel. The risk of picking up winter bugs is another reason that I don't spend my money on winter holidays. To minimise your risks, have the flu jab, wear a mask on the plane, and use hand sanitiser as much as possible."
"Unfortunately the latest reports state that the flu jab is pretty ineffective in the elderly. Wearing a mask on the journey is a good idea, in the airport as well as on the plane."
I have to say I have had the flu jab and am currently suffering with the flu! Had it for 2 weeks now. The flu jab is not effective against all strains of the virus. I think you have to do all you can to protect yourself however if you are going to get it you could get it anywhere.
"I've not had a flu jab. I got it last year and was in bed for a week over Christmas. This year I got a mild dose and was only in bed for a few days over New Year, but didn't go out of the house for well over a week but I'm still coughing and having stomach problems. Friends who do get the flu jab also got it last year, but only mildly, this year they've escaped so far. You've more chance of catching it in the UK than in Lanzarote. You're infectious from when symptoms start and it comes on quickly. If you've got it you're not going on a plane or anywhere else because you can't get out of bed, and when you can you just can't do anything much. So many people say they've got or had flu when actually they've just had a really bad cold.Edited: 2 years ago "
"True Leyland , they do research the probabilities of which strain of flu will turn up , unfortunately , one of the strains this year was from Australia , dunno if it came directly from there , or via several other countries , apparently it is quite bad , and the flu jab I have would be pretty ineffectiveHave seen a couple of guys that are resident in PDC who had flu in the last week , not sure what strain thoughEdited: 2 years ago "
Jeez there's some pretty appalling pseudoscience going on here.It's is crazy not to get the flu vaccineEven if it's only just 10% effective then that increases the herd immediately and reduces the chance of those with weaker immune systems of catching flu.And no the flu vaccine does not give you flu Leyland. As you get older it is even more important to get the vaccine. It's generally between 40% to 60% effective depending on the year as flu is a tricky beggar compared to measles and the other vaccines which are 99% effective.As per the original question....you might get run over tomorrow so does that stop you leaving the house....
"Accountant75 is right. If available to you, get the Flu Jan, it's common sense. Of course it doesn't give 100% immunity but something is better than nothing, particularly for vulnerable persons. If you see people walking around coughing and sneezing, they haven't got the flu. You really wouldn't be able to get out of bed if you had a dose.It's like anything in life, reduce the risk if you can...Edited: 2 years ago "
"The op has not said whether they have had the flu jab or not. I am wondering if the insurance will be a bigger problem as may cost them more than the holiday to insure. If they are winging it as such, they may be summing up the risks If you are please make sure you have at least an EHIC card each which is free and will cover emergency treatment this won't cover extended stay or lost flight home and other worse things.The free clinic and how to get there is listed above in the top questions on the right"
but only free with that EHIC card
<<And no the flu vaccine does not give you flu Leyland. >>Did I say it did??? Credit me with some common sense!
"I would have thought given the OP is over 65 they'd have had it, as long as they don't have problems that make it unsuitable."
"Be interested to know if holiday has been cancelled or OP still going ? At least in Lanzarote it’s warm , you can enjoy the fresh air , rather than being in the house with heating on , or outside trying to stand on very frozen icy snow !"
"Always good advice to get a flu jab , your GP usually sends a letter re free flu jabs for anyone over 60 , or 65 , think it’s 60in Scotland , I’m probably wrong there though lol , Carter’s get it free as well , as wouldn’t be good if they were ill Always get an EHIC card they are free online , if they say there’s a charge , they are chancers , would say scammers , but it’s not illegal , try googling NHS EHIC card , or Gov.UK EHIC As others have said you can get run over by a bus , chances of getting the flu is not that high ,Edited: 2 years ago "
"Carers , not Carter’s"
Apols Leyland on first reading it looked like you'd linked the jab with getting ill.I've had flu once in my life and was bed bound for 2 weeks.If someone is well enough to walk around and cough in your vicinity then they don't have flu....
I suppose it is important that people involved in the transport industry are not layed low Ian. lol.
Apology accepted and appreciated accountant.
