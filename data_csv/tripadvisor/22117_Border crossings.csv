"Been looking at reports of border crossings closing because of coronavirus fears, Any news on what's happening? Have booked a week's holiday in Kyrenia in April, flying into Larnaca. Is there much being said in North Cyprus itself? Thanks"
"No cases in Cyprus, the border crossing points that have been closed for ONE WEEK ONLY are for foot crossings only, Taxis etc use different crossings which remain open."
Thanks for that. Are they carrying out extra checks at border or is it business as usual?
At moment nurses check for fever and this makes delays in crossing over. Will see how things go after a few days
"What is the purpose of only closing for foot crossings and why the one week rule? I donâ€™t understand the logic to this though I am pleased that they are still open for car crossings as I am also concerned for our crossing from Larnaca in the summer especially as political tensions are on the rise. Starting to worry that we should have flown direct to the North and should the border close for whatever reason and prevent us from reaching our booked destination, I have no idea how the travel insurance would view this and whether they would cover."
"The purpose of closing 4 crossing points is to have nurses available for the rest. The Ledra closure is for better control of those who cannot read instruction leaflets in the 4 languages that are printed and specially those on foot. Main concern is that on occupied part there are no means of detecting virus and after their refusal to forward speciments to ROC labs and instead send them to Turkey concerned south so stepped up controls. The one week clause is provided hopefully all goes wellEdited: 11:01 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Yes Natasha, that had occurred to me. It might be difficult to get a payout from insurance. However, if you've booked a package through a company then they would probably have an obligation to provide the trip you booked, an alternative or a refund. I'm flying out with Cyprus Paradise next month and am watching things closely."
"Reports in South Cyprus media suggest there are concerns about thousands of Iranian students in North Cyprus. Iran is, of course, a coronavirus hotspot."
rooba63Firstly the numbers are not in the thousands and those that are here have been since before the breakout(so no threat). Any that have gone home for holidays etc are not being allowed back in .

"Natasha B , thousands die yearly from flu, cancer etc , where is your concern then ?"
"I crossed north on Tue and back today Thu 5th Mar,at Ledra Palace on foot , there are no queues, no medical checks. All very calm. A friend reported people waving flags etc last night as she went to pick up someone ,by car, at North airport, didn't ask which crossing."
Ledra crossing closure extended to Monday.People waving flags were from group asking for permanent close. Tentions among locals on this
Thanks for your replies everyone. At the moment I fully intend to go ahead with my holiday next month. However this may change if there are issues with border crossing. In that case I'll probably just take flight to Larnaca and arrange my own accommodation in the South. Both sides of the border equally appealing to me.

"Hi, just interested to see if there have been any developments. Cyprus News reporting on demonstrations at closed crossings in Nicosia."
"The demonstrations have been at ONE, crossing point , Ledra Street which is for foot crossings only, the vehicle crossing points remain unaffected"
Thanks for that.
"Just returned yesterday as of yesterday all hotels have closed, I my business opened are pharmacy's, police, supermarketz. The border south to north has closed and all flights cancelled. Jet 2 flew an empty plane out to Paphos to bring us home, nothing flying in either."

Thank JayJay. Glad you got home safe and sound.
Hello.What is the situation now? I plan visiting Kyrenia in June. Will be coming from Larnaca by car.
How will get to Larnaca?
"I have a flight to Larnaca mid June , it is not cancelled yet. Are the borders open now between South and North Cyprus?"
Borders are closed and do not expect any flights to Larnaca by mid June. Rumors are that by mid June flights from Greece and Israel might start provided no flare up of Virus cases after easing of lockdown
"Ok, thank you very much."
"hi everyone, I have been reading that north Cyprus is more or less virus free, does anybody have an update on whether the borders are open from the south to the north"
"Borders still closed. They will allow crossing of Turkish Cypriot workers, students and cancer patients to south from June 8.Edited: 5:21 am, May 22, 2020 "
"thank you for your reply, have a place in north cyprus but normally fly into larnaca, i suppose i wont book any flights anytime soon.thank you"
We have flights booked into Larnaca for early August so really hoping border is open by then.
