"Can anyone on the ground or who follows and can translate Mexican media sources into English keep us apprised of how the Mexican government is responding to the crisis? I was struck by this quote from WHO’s director today: “We are concerned that in some countries, the level of political will does not match the level of the threat we face.” It did not reference Mexico. However, the only response I could find online from President López Obrador was an AP report from 5 days ago saying, “President Andrés Manuel López Obrador appeared to downplay the seriousness of the COVID-19 virus, saying ‘it isn't even equivalent to flu.’Seasonal flu kills more people because it has infected far more people, but the new virus appears to have a far higher mortality rate.”It said there’d be daily updates regarding their response but I cannot find them. The WHO confirmed today what most not in denial already knew: that the virus is more contagious and more deadly than flu by percentage, and that many more cases will emerge as more testing is done. I am curious about whether testing is available and being utilized in Mexico. I appreciate that they have concerns about how reports of more cases will impact their tourist industry. I’d also like to know what resources and plans they are putting into place, similar to what information is available in the U.S. via the CDC. It would help me, and, I hope, others make informed decisions."
"ReviewerMaryland1, check out Mexico News Daily.Great online source in English that will allow you to keep up with all the news in Mexico. It is a subscription service but the price is minimal (and you can cancel when you no longer need to stay up to date) but even if you don't want to subscribe, you can read something like 8 articles a month free. I read it daily and learn a lot of things about what's going on here that I otherwise wouldn't.Here's a link to an article that was published yesterday:https:/…Edited: 4:08 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Joan,Thank you so much. This is exactly what I was hoping for. I know if you read anything worthy of sharing about the cases or Mexico’s response, that you will."

"I would strongly advise people who are still traveling to CUN or PDC area to get medical travel insurance. I have personally never purchased it but this the perfect time to start. Of course the Mexican President will down play this because they rely heavily on tourism. I can say I am really watching the cruise lines to see if Mexico is turning them away from ports. I travel in May so hopefully @Joan or @Robert in Cozumel can give us updates on this if we happen to overlook a news article or they are hearing things on the ground the news isn’t reporting!! Fingers crossed, especially for for Mexico’s tourism and the locals health."
"#6 and 7 were my primary concerns. It’s easy to look like you have few or no cases if you’re not testing. If travelers have freely been entering from high risk regions then QR may actually have a very concerning number. When governments, including my own, downplay the risk they endanger everyone."

"Also in today's Por Esto:Coronavirus Covid-19 could affect the arrival of cruise ships in CancunCozumel does not report any possible involvement in the operation of ships due to this diseaseMarch 6, 2020 Coronavirus Covid-19 could affect the arrival of cruise ships in CancunAlthough Cozumel does not report any involvement in the cruise operation, this segment can be impacted in the coming months by the noise generated by the coronavirus, Covid-19 in many countries, which keeps tourism service providers like dolphinariums cautious and attentive. , since this segment represents 5 to 7% of its operations in cruise destinations. This was reported by Eduardo Albor, CEO of Grupo Dolphin that operates in eight countries with 31 parks and habitats.The attention is maintained, he said, because in destinations such as Jamaica and Cayman Islands they are reporting cruise ship cancellations and arrival of vessels due to the noise that has been made of the health issue and this has been causing cancellations to other service providers. Case in point what was recorded last week with the cruise that was not allowed to berth in some countries.“In the case of Cozumel, in Mexico, no impact has been felt so far on the issues of operation, however, we are very cautious, we are a little worried about the effect that could occur this month with cruise ships, because that is where the subject has made more noise, ”he said.In that regard, he commented that the service provider sector remains cautious of the reaction that is being taken on the issue, both in airlines, cruises and travel agencies to be prevented.At the moment he informed that they remain cautious in matters of capital investment, with an intelligent management of resources and redirecting market strategies to continue encouraging the trip and the visit to habitats.March, he said, is for the cruise industry a very good month, but it will depend on how the circumstances are going to be and if the tourist who is traveling by cruise will really be going down in the destinations.In the case of the Mexican Caribbean, the investor said that the issue of the coronavirus has not been so strong and it could be that as a destination it reports a growth by the people who are redirecting the trip, but the focus is on the people who by the effect The health situation decides not to travel, and that is where the market risk is.“Cozumel has done a good job and it is not an alert point, we know it, but it is important that passengers know it, so it said that so far we do not feel impact on assistance, but we have to keep monitoring it day by day , maybe not this week, but what will happen in the following, ”he said.In that expectation the CEO said that as a company you always have a plan B and a plan B1 and B2 and B3, in the confidence that this situation will finally benefit destinations, but it is important to be attentive to the entire market."

"Dear Joan,thank you for your updates.We are from Germany and we will travel at 11.03. to Quintana Roo (Landing at cancun ap).What about measures at the airport like feaver testing or thinks like that? Prevents the virus-panic the entry? We are looking forward to our vacation and it would be annoying if we were denied entry. We are healthy and had no contact to corona infected People :).Lot of thanks for your support.Regards from germany,Mike"
"MikeGER, as far as I know the airport is not conducting anything like fever testing at this time."
">> ""What about measures at the airport like feaver testing or thinks like that?""So far, this is not happening, but it did happen during one of the previous virus outbreaks, so it could happen if the situation worsens. On that occasion, I was flying out of Cancun, and passengers had their temperatures taken before being allowed to check-in -- took an extra 10 minutes or so.So far, there only 5 or 6 (depending on the source of information) confirmed COVID-19 cases.Edited: 9:53 am, March 07, 2020 "
thanks do post any updates
great update thanks
"hi,I am travelling to Cancun, mexico from canada on march 29 (4 adults,1 toddler).little worried about coronavirus. We are looking forward to our vacation but a bit scared as well. Is it safe to travel? please advise"
"Suhpreet 5, I know this is a very long thread but read through at least the last 4 or 5 pages of so. You will find a lot of info to answer your own question. It really is one only you can answer once you have all the relevant info."
My husband and I are planning to go to Ensenada this Thursday. Is it safe to go?
Try posting your question in the Ensenada forum .You'll get a more specific answer there although travel is travel. Follow the guidelines set by your government and health officials. No one on a message board can give you anything but opinions. Listen to the experts.
"How can anyone in there right mind consider travelling to Mexico or anywhere for that matter.We are due to travel on Friday 20th, Airlines and Sovereign states have a duty of care to people, staff, customers and residents of the countries they visit.All travel should be suspended until this is under control. Do you want to be responsible for a death of a loved one at home or in Mexico.the UK has had good testing and Health officials have suggested there may be many thousands who have the virus that have been missed, USA and Mexico have been very slow to react. There are certainly more cases in Mexico that have been reported."
We were scheduled to fly out on Friday 03/20/20 to stay at the Grand Palladium Colonial and fly back on 03/27/2020. I found out by chance that they are closing the hotel on 03/25/2020. We had to cancel our vacation. We did not get any notice from our travel agent and I did not see this on the Grand Palladium web site. I was only in contact with the hotel for room assignments when I asked and they told me they were closing the hotel and their other properties. Please be aware of this. You do not want to be in a situation where you have no place to stay or trying to find flights home early.
"We have friends in Playa del Cameron so I was checking on what was happening there. CANT' BELIEVE THE STATEMENT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT (As of March 23rd 2020, there are 12 confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the Riviera Maya & Cancun region.)HERE IS THE LATEST FROM THE LOCAL STATE GOVERNMENT!!!!!!!!!“The Mexican Caribbean continues to receive tourists and remains vigilant with rigorous prevention measures of COVID ‐ 19″“GIVEN THE LOW RISK OF CONTAGION, the CDC has not recommended changing travel plans to the Mexican Caribbean due to COVID-19, unless it is part of the risk groups in which case any non-essential travel should be avoided.”“There is no travel ban or restrictions for those who return from Quintana Roo to the United States of America, Canada, and almost any other country, as long as they have not visited any of the countries listed Level 3 – Health Notice for Travelers, level 3 by the CDC, in a period of 14 days.”“International passengers arriving at the Cancun International Airport (CUN) must go through a thermal scanner to measure body temperature.”"
"Oh wow Sandra V! That is an outright deception from that government source! Speaking as a Canadian I can assure everyone that anyone coming home from outside my country and that includes everywhere, even the land border with the US must self isolate for 14 days. No such thing as level 3 or whatever. Every country is on the list. I believe the US has the exact same rule."

"This may have been posted before, but this is the first time I have seen it. Here is an AP article about the COVID-19 response in Mexico. It doesn't sound good.""Too little too late? Experts decry Mexico virus policy delay""https:/…db02704d24faa6190afdd407074b7f84"
"This post was published on 4 March 2020. By today's standards, it's ancient news. Today, anything published before 15 March is not only irrelevant but even irresponsible, because it seeks to regurgitate opinions cast in another era. Nothing is the same anywhere in the world than what it was last week. We need to stand at the edge of this tragedy looking forward in order to avoid further damage, instead of looking backwards to point fingers elsewhere, which only distracts our efforts. In the above article, the vultures of AP continue to make a dime publishing editorial opinion so people like the poster can sleep at night blaming other people."
Truth hurts Miguel. I'm praying for your country. You may want to start praying as well.
The reality is the coronavirus has a ways to go to really grab the attention away from other Mexico daily life tragedies.https:/…
Not just daily Mexican tragedies. News about the virus has grabbed the attention away from daily tragedies world wide.
"What year is this!?I feel like I just walked in a 1960s bar full of homeless veterans arguing about the civil war. Hey @duckbilled, if I was you I'd worry more about Michigan and the 15,000 cases and your drug problem. Also check your murder figures while you're at it. Truth hurts alright."
"Recently just came back from Tulum and tested Neg for the Rona. Was a great trip, had beautiful weather. But like all of us, ready for things to get back to normal. Which will be soon. Salud and sending good vibesEdited: 6:57 am, April 04, 2020 "
"Bottom line ,,,,, Cancun is now closed!While you are enjoying your ""house arrest"" you should be planning your next vacation, you know, for after the great PAUSE!BTW, if you waited until your airline actually canceled your flight, good for your ballsy self! The US of A has now required your airline to refund you! Those of us who did not wait and who intelligently realized that our Resort would most likely be shut down when we arrived, and cancelled in advance of departure, well, we must be satisfied with credits.Hopefully, there will be a future when those credits will be worth anything. Vote... when it comes to deciding who gets bailed out with tax payer dollars sooner. Your choices could be: 1. domestic (USA) restaurants and bars; 2. domestic infrastructure; 3. domestic airlines and cruise ships Stay alert, everybody, and wash your hands. See you all on the beaches of Cancun ASAP!"
"”Recently just came back from Tulum and tested Neg for the Rona.""Glad to hear that!"
Any word on reopening Cancun. Planned late June visit. See that hotels may be open again May 1st. Is it possible they will?
Leah - no
Looks like closed until May 31 at this point. It is really difficult to know what will happen. Take care all!

"You come from the US yet you worry about the Mexican leader downplaying the covid threat? If you're in fair health, in reasonable shape don't worry about a virus that is almost always about as deadly as a common cold"
"COVID definitely downplayed, too many casualties already. Just use your senses, do not take unnecessary risks. Stay home till situation is cleared up."
