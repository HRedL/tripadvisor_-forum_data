Baker just announced this strict new quarantine:https:/…
"This time he's serious:""Under the order, everyone coming to the state must fill out a “Massachusetts Travel Form” and quarantine for 14 days unless they are coming from a state where the coronavirus risk is lower or they can produce a negative coronavirus test result administered no more than 72 hours prior to arriving in Massachusetts, the governor’s office said. """
Boston Globe says to buy a subscription to read an article.
"Thanks.I was planning on quarantining as a returning resident anyway but glad to see this will be an option:""I plan to get a test at my cost and will remain in quarantine until I receive a negative result""Except it's impossible to both quarantine and go out and get a test."
"For those who don't have a paid subscription here are key points beginning August 1st:* Every traveler coming into Mass (including MA residents traveling from out-of-state)* Must fill out a “Massachusetts Travel Form” AND quarantine for 14 days* OR produce a negative coronavirus test result administered no more than 72 hours prior to arriving in Massachusetts* Those who get a test must remain in quarantine until they receive their negative test results* Exempt states are only lower risk states, which include: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Hawaii* Violators are subject to a $500 per day fine"
"I think this is a good idea.However ... Getting a test and results in 72 hours is problematic in many areas. My kid goes to school in Vermont and they have a similar requirment. The school is enforcing it for returning students, and being especially strict with those moving into dorms. The parents’ group on FB is full of stressed out of state parents unable to get appts for tests or find some place that will give results quickly.Edited: 12:08 pm, July 24, 2020 "
No one needs to read an article about the governor's new directive--it's all here on the state website: https:/…covid-19-travel-order
"sorry for the pay link, I thought they had a handful of free reads/monthhere is a free version, I hopehttps:/…"
Hank you have to get tested before returning to ma
Can you please tell me what you are reading that makes you say that?
"......this would seem to clearly indicate that is not the case ""You may obtain a test at your own expense after your arrival in Massachusetts but you MUST quarantine until you obtain a negative result.""Are you seeing something that contradicts that?"
"All visitors entering Massachusetts, including returning residents, who do not meet an exemption, are required to:Complete the Massachusetts Travel Form prior to arrival, unless you are visiting from a lower-risk state designated by the Department of Public Health.Quarantine for 14 days or produce a negative COVID-19 test result that has been administered up to 72-hours prior to your arrival in Massachusetts.If your COVID-19 test result has not been received prior to arrival, visitors, and residents must quarantine until they receive a negative test result.https:/…covid-19-travel-order"
"Further, to Hank’s point that he may obtain a test after returning to the state (quarantining until a negative result is received), the “Testing as an alternative “ section states:“ You may obtain a test at your own expense after your arrival in Massachusetts, but you MUST quarantine until you obtain a negative result. Use the COVID-19 testing map to find a site near you. “https:/…massachusetts-travel-form-Edited to add: Sorry! Repeating what Hank wrote in his follow-up post, but I’ve included the source and a link.Edited: 3:23 pm, July 24, 2020 "
I read what ting posted. Test 72 hrs prior to arrival.
"Is there a place for MA visitiors to to get a RAPID COVID test upon entering MA? I know there is a place in ME to get one, I have an appointment to get one. However, I'd like to go to MA as well on the trip, so would need a test to stop in MA.There really aren't any available here in VA for asymptomatic travel related testing and everyone here is reporting that PCR testing results are taking week or longer (sometimes as long as 15 days), so hoping there are in MA.Thanks!Edited: 9:20 pm, July 24, 2020 "
I seem to have sick relatives everywhere this week. Ugh!My mother has made her home on the Cape for over 50 years. She is elderly and I am the closest relative(DC). I was planning to go up to see her in few weeks and put a plan of elder care in action. I also need to drive her into Boston for doctor appointments as she is ill. It sounds like I can no longer go to see my Mom because of the restrictions posted today. Is this correct? I think they do have temporary nursing care facilities in the area that could manage care until I am allowed to drive into my home state. I am a currently licensed registered nurse in Massachusetts so I could possibly temporarily relocate to her area for work.Apologies if I am off-topic for this posting.
"You can get tested before you leave Maryland and with a negative test result (within 72 hours of leaving), you wouldn't have to quarantine. Or come up early after being tested and quarantine until you get the results. I'm sorry for your situation. Taking care of elder relatives and parents is challenging enough, without it happening during the pandemic."
If you are an essential worker you don’t have to quarantine
IF you are going to do essential work!
"Long overdue, at the rates the virus is spreading in others parts of the country, it is welcoming to see. Let's hope people follow the rules!!!"
