here is the e-mail address for the mayor of benidorm concerning the problem of street crime in benidormbenidorm@gva.eshope this can be useful
"Cannot see the mayors email address being useful, after all would you email your mayor in the UK if you got mugged. It might be useful if there was an epidemic but it's no worse here than back home, probably better here."
"Here we go again...?all the ex-pats defending Benidorm.making out the crime in benidorm is ok, because its worse in the UK.When are you all going to wake up and smell the coffee,we are not talking about the crime in the UK.or the crime in spain....?we are talking about the crime in Benidorm......."
"This is to anyone holidaying in Benidorm, when you see women (usually three or four) walikng along the street wearing long skirts and carrying big bags at night cross the road and avoid them, more so if you're alone, they will try and rob you, we witnessed this tonight, a guy walking along the road alone in front of us 4 of these scum bags tried to get him in a corner so they could steal from him, luckily there was a couple walking along close to him and they stopped them. Just please be careful and avoid these low lifes!! If you do get any problem make as much noise as you can!!"
lesmac 007 well said.
"And report all crimes, no matter how small to the police. If you do not, the true crime rate will not be shown and they may even reduce police even more. But dont go to Benidorm thinking its the crime centre of Spain. Just be aware these things do happen. Enjoy"
"Hi whats going on in Benidorm ? not been in contact for a few months I go to Beni about two times a year usally May Sep I have heard about the occational mugging but reading the latest forums it seems to be getting worst,the occational mugging on the yellow brick road or the potateo mob were your only concern any feed back to how bad it is and what are the black spots (if any)..........gen concern"
"Benidorm Bobby,all your questions had been answered here, but Trip Advisor decided to remove the posts,probably won't be long before this one is removed as well...?See TA people need to know, so they don't get caught out. "
"re crime in Beni, hope I'm not pushing my luck, but we have been visiting the resort for over 20 years (christmas and new year) and have only heard of one mugging - that was an old guy (like me) but he was walking thru' Dove Park alone late at night and two guys jumped him and took his wallet! - what was he doing carrying his wallet? and he could have taken a different route! - the other problem is with the ""potato men"" on the prom - makes you wonder why the police haven't sorted that by now, everyone knows they are there, how easy would it be to seal that prom off and round them up?, with cctv evidence that should be the end of it. I feel a lot safer in Beni than I do in my home town, so the message is keep your wits about you and watch out for the immigrants - they stand out by their dress and swarthier appearance - here endeth the lesson!"
"Benidorm Bobby - I was robbed of my handbag and this happened in the road that has Morgans and The Western Bar and also close to the Ambassader hotel, think it may be Calle Gerona, and hearing from others this appears to be a hot spot, just so you are aware. Take Care."
"We stay at Villa de Benidorm next to Morgans,and this year the holiday rep advised us to be careful in this area ,because of the robberies,that was in March,WELL we was pickpocket when we stopped to look at the sand sculptures!!you know the scene a crowd of people again!!,so not just the potato men,hasnt put us off though,going again next year,will be more on guard in the day as well as the evening now.Dont anyone be put off Benidorm is a great place to go,we love it,Lovely beach,the best entertainment you will ever get,and a good climate in the winter,never boring,plenty to do."
I was going to go to Benidorm April-May next year for maybe two weeks but am not sure now. Crowds can be avoided but muggings and such are not so easy. Are apartments safe if I take a laptop? You have to be very careful of that in southern Portugal.
"Please do not be put off coming to Benidorm it is a great place!! just be careful like you would any other place,We walk along streets very late at night almost every night because of our work and have always felt safe but like I wrote earlier there are opportunests going about like everywhere else, so just take care and have a great holiday!!!"
"HiWhat is up with you people, crowds can't be avoided in Benidorm it is always very busy. Muggings can be avoided as long as you take the normal precautions you would take at home. I personally wouldn't take a laptop on holiday with me, I would just use the internet facilities in the hotel/cafe. As for security in hotels and apartments, I wouldn't actually take anything that was precious and I didn't want to lose (i.e. expensive jewellery and gadgets)There is crime everywhere in the world and yes some places are worse than others but you are no more at risk in Benidorm than you are at home or anywhere else. Try to stop worrying and just enjoy your holiday or you might as well stay at home behind closed doors with the curtains closed"
Dear allI'm very sorry to say but it looks to me like a Benidorm Witch Hunt!!Just to put things into perspective - Just think how many thousands of people visit Benidorm every year and how many are the victims of crime - the number of victims is tiny compared to the number visiting!I know that any crime is too much crime but hey 'get a grip' some of you out there!!You are putting people off of visiting a beautiful country with lots to offer with your tales of woe and it is quite frankly beingning to p**s me off ! Grow up some of you !Tabitha :-)
"thanks for the warning.the wife & me plus another couple are off to beni for a fri/sat night ciggie run/booze up and to be honest we wil have a diffrent holiday now due to recent crime reports we have read on here.we normaly go to palma nova/magaluf,looks like that will be the case in future.shame really but you aint gonna be going some where you dont think is safe are you no matter what people may say to reaasure you.we are staying at the villa de benidorm and we dont want to stray to far from the hotel now so can any one reccomend any good pubs in this area. thanks"
"I always warn people of the bad as well as the good about any resort or city. They should know so they can decide for themselves. On another forum earlier tonight I was reading about pick-pockets in Madrid.I was last in Benidorm about five years ago and had brilliant weather in November (though the nights were cold), and no crowds other than on market day. I did have a good two weeks in Tossa de Mar recently.My laptop is my entertainment centre. I write using it, and have several hundred books on it. It has hundreds of songs, some videos on and a number of games. I tend not to go out at night.I now live in France and in a few weeks time, cheap flights by Ryanair to Alicante will start up so I will probably take advantage of them next year. Not before then as I prefer winter in Asia which is a bit warmer (30.C+) and will be on my 3 month visit, 2 weeks from now."
"Yozef, I think you will change your mind once you arrive in Benidorm, we pass your hotel all the time and have never seen anything going on outside it. Too many scare mungers!! But there's plenty going on on your doorstep entertainment wise, Morgans is just next door to you. Have a good holiday"

Well done Alisonandmark for this report in the public interest. Now will you beni resident expats accept that there is a problem and however much you say it isn't a problem-it is especially to the victims? Lesmac has been shouting in deaf ears about it on this site for ages.

"Alison, did your apartment block not have a Reception? They would have called the police for you..Obviously, it would be foolish to intervene personally but if you saw this happening, maybe some of them could have been prevented if the police were called at the time?"
I simply cannot believe that you watched 30 muggings take place and you did absolutely NOTHING to help!?!
Sorry but I don't believe you saw 30 muggings take place in the first instance and if by any remote chance it was true I can't believe you sat and watched and did nothing. I don't mean intervene personally but you could have phoned the policeShame on you both!!!
"Well said Smudges,I'm surprised she didn't start selling tickets !"
i am sorry if i have upset anyone with my post and our apartment only had a housekeeper in the day i love benidorm and am returning in march the police were there but to late to do anything if we didnt have the children with us mayb we would have went down but on another site when a woman intervened who was a nurse she was attacked to please dont let my post put you off going just be careful 
"Tabitha ans SmudgesMum,And there was me trying to be diplomatic with my post! Well said."

"well......As an expat(Dutch) i can honestly say that i am not defending the streets of Benidorm in thinking they are safe, I have never experienced any crime either when I lived in Holland or Portugal or on my many holidays in the U.K..Mind you for those who do not wish to be mugged:Do not wear your handbag on your back with the zipper open.Do not get drunk and leave your bag next to chair(or dance around it in your white stiletos and forget it was there).Do not stop and look at the piotato men doing their tricks.Do not bury your stuff under your head in view of everyone when you go to the beach, just leave it in the hotel safe and take a bit o money for a drin!There you go the new wannabe mayor has spoken!"
"piotato is meant to be potato, i am sorry for my spelling miztakkees"
"I returned frm beni after the festival last week. The police presence is higher than i can ever remember. However it didnt stop 1 of our group being dipped he was nowhere near rolling drunk. I get the feeling they are Officer Dibbles being given the runround by TC his gang... On fancy dress day, Im not sure it required 20 Guardia Civil to appear as back up to local police in order to clear the blocked road outside wookey hollow yorks pride... they are about if you use them."
"the police here just like to go out in big groups. They are a bit like the Pink Ladies from Grease. After they had a carajillo coffee and a brandy to wash that down with, they roll around Benidorm with shirtsleeves rolled up and a fag dangling from either corner of ther mouthes, whistling at women.Just kidding. The police and guardia do a good job here, as do the police in the uk and holland."
