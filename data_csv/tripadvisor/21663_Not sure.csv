We are booked for April break but are so unsure if we should cancel because of the virus. It’s so hard to decide..... anyone else in same boat??
We will be there April 5th. Much needed sun & sand.
You have as much chance of catching it in new york as anywhere else. Just follow the same hygiene rules you would at home
We’re wondering the same thing. We’ll be driving down Easter weekend from Ohio. We’ll be there 10 days. Today is the last day to cancel.
"You need to ask your health care professional.I would take the trip, but that is my opinion, and it's not worth much."
"We are flying, and we will have my granddaughter just don’t want her in harms way.... thinking I wait till cancellation day gets closer. I really want to go"
We are coming first week of April. I do not have plans to cancel. We are driving and feel the risk is minimal.
We will be there March 31-thru 4-4. Looking forward to it and plan to wash our hands as much there as we are doing at home and using common sense precautions.
Just saying that local stores may be out of certain staples. So bring paper goods with. Fresh produce and meats very available.
"everything is fine, shelfs are stocked"
I would really reconsider. This isn’t Just about the risk To you as the traveler - it’s about the contact from your home area and risk you are bringing in to any person you interact with. Trump is talking about domestic travel bans.
"trump would also say probably fake news, how many people you know got it"
"Shell, we have 3 confirmed cases in the last 3 daysin my county and they are only testing you if you are basically critically ill presenting to the ER, so who knows how many people are actually carriers."
"If everyone ceases all non essential travel, the nation has a much better chance of controlling the spread of the virus."
"I can’t believe some of the posts on here. I can’t believe some people’s aversion to facts.The CDC said to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people. How many planes do you know that have fewer seats? Cruise lines have cancelled, events and hotels are closing. Every qualified health expert says this can become a National disaster unless people stop traveling and being in groups. Are you watching what’s happening in Italy? Doctor’s are choosing who lives and dies due to ventilator shortages. The US Healthcare system is not set up to handle this. Google “flattening the curve of a pandemic” and get educated if you’re going to give other people advise.  All of this is easily verifiable from sources across the political spectrum. If you think this is fake news, there is something wrong with you.It irresponsible to travel. If you want to put yourself and your family at risk, that’s your business. However it’s wrong to infect the elderly person who touches something you touched or to bring the virus home to your family and friends. Many cases are symptom free, especially among young people, so you don’t even know you have it. If you have any empathy and regard for other people‘s safety, stay home."
Will they close beaches? https:/…
we will see
Has anything in the area been closed or restricted hours? Like grocery stores?
"Just so everyone knows I canceled my trip. I am not putting myself, my family or any of my fellow citizens at risk . Hopefully everyone does the right thing and we can get back to our lives sooner rather than later. Stay healthy and safe❤️"
We cancelled our trip. We can go when it’s all clear and not so many what-ifs. The beach will still be there.
In regard to beach closures: the Governor has stated that it will be left up to each county. That said the National television coverage of crammed beaches in Florida is not a good look and may result in an increase in closures. The Panhandle has had more confirmed cases today with one death of a non- resident. All bars and nightclubs are closed. Many restaurants are closed while others offer only carry out. Some are allowing 50% occupancy. Grocery stores are closing early and are out of a lot of products. It’s a take what you can get. Delivery is taking longer too. Stay home until this is over please. Your vacation can be rebooked.
"Beaches are closed as of last night. All Bay County, Walton County, and PCB Beaches are closed. Restaurants are closed except for take out or delivery. Tourist venues such as movies, water parks, etc are closed. Stores are closed or closing. Grocery stores are being severely impacted by people panic buying. There is at least one confirmed case in supposedly a nonresident tourist , several in the surrounding community. We just started to get back on out feet after Hurricane Michael, and now this. Our medical infrastructure is limited at best, with very few ICU beds, very few critical care professionals. Give it a month, come back when its passed. The beaches will still be here, the sun will still shine."
Just look at my recent post.Check out the PWilly's web-cam.SO SAD
"We are in the same boat. Coming from Michigan. Talked to our rental and they said they haven't heard anything about closing their rental. We live 17 hours away and don't wanna travel all the way there and not be able to stay. We are planning on quarantining there so beaches and stuff being closed doesn't bother us. Just not sure what to do, we are supposed to leave on Friday the 3rd..."
Please stay home. We do not need our healthcare system overwhelmed by vacationers! There is an order that all vacation rentals are suspended.https://www.wtxl.com/news/local-news/gov-des…
Excellent info.
"Things have changed rapidly, and in all fairness comments at the beginning of the thread may have changed. I know mine has changed from 17 days ago when I first commented."
"Mine definitely changed too, in the beginning i never thought we would get to this stage! We are in partial lockdown and still people are not doing as they should. Im hoping for my November holiday but wouldnt be surprised if it did t happen, may already cancelled. Stay where you are. Im sure at this stage travel is severely limited between states etc"
Our plans have unfortunately been cancelled as well by the Condo owner. We're very disappointed but don't want to contribute to the problem either! Pray for everyone who is sick & stay healthy!
We've cancelled our plans & hoping for maybe the end of May. As a condo owner we don't want to contribute to a problem so we'll change our plans.
"The Governor has clarified the order to suspend vacation rentals; for edification purposes onlyS: Governor DeSantis Executive Order Vacation RentalsVacation RentalsI hereby order all parties engaged in rental of vacation rental properties, as defined in section 509.242( l )(c), Florida Statutes, to suspend vacation rental operations.

This directive shall include the:Rental of any house, condominium, cooperative, or dwelling unit that is also a transient public lodging establishment, as defined under Section 509.013(4)(a), Florida Statute s; andWhich is rented for periods of less than 30 days or I calendar month, whichever is less; orWhich is advertised or held out to the public as a place regularly rented to guests; orWhich is otherwise regulated by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (""DBPR"") as a vacation rental pursuant to section 509.241, Florida Statutes.This directive shall not include the following:Hotels, motels, inns, resorts, non-transient pub.lie lodging establishments, or timeshare projects; or Long-term rentals; orRental stays where guest s are currently staying in a vacation rental or have previously booked a stay and are scheduled to check-in no later than March 28, 2020; orRentals to persons performing military, emergency, governmental, health or infrastructure response, or travelers engaged in non-vacation commercial activities."
Did you go ? Is everything closed ?
"Most places of interest in Florida have already been closed for a week or 2 at this point. In SW Florida, we've been encouraged to stay inside for the past 3 weeks, and haven't been able to eat at a restaurant since March 13th. New cases have sky-rockected in Florida since spring break began in early March. Today, our Governor followed many other states in closing down all non-essential businesses, and making it a criminal offense punishable by jail and/or a 500 dollar fine for violation of traveling for a non-essential purpose, Anyone planning to come to Florida in April will not have a good time, and may not have a place to stay (since hotels are not essential businesses), a beach to go to, and will not have anything other than take-out for food. Grocery stores have been short on many food items, and all paper and sanitizing products, for weeks at this point, and there are lines to get into stores just to look at what they might have in stock. Stay home, and if you've paid money to get to Florida in April, try to get it back as soon as possible now before you lose it."
"Private beaches are also closed for 30 days as of today. Stay safe, everyone!"
