"Hello everyone, Yesterday, we took a walk into touristy Budapest. Think Vaci utca, Oktober 6 utca, into Jewish Quarters. First, foot traffic was very light. I could have hit 5-irons down Vaci and rarely hit anyone (and no golf jokes please!) The locals by far have done a wonderful job across the quarantine, thankfully limiting the spread to date. Who knows what tomorrow holds. But most importantly and unfortunately not surprising - there were many for sale/lease signs in what were restaurants and shops 2 months ago. I was a bit surprised by the number and the speed of which the signage has gone up. It’s a terrible time for small business owners and my heart goes to them. It appears Budapest has lost some solid restaurants that I used to recommend. It’s likely more will follow. Sad. Outside of the Four Seasons, many hotels also appeared closed - but temporarily so it seems. Some restaurants with outdoor seating were open and quite full which was a delight to see. Think Tokyo, Iguana, Térv, and Pomo d’Oro to name a few where we walked past. A small sample and one that will continue to change as these times continue. And a continued excellent outcomes of these times has been the beautiful clean and clear air. We can see further across the flats of Pest than we ever have across 20+ years. Wishing everyone good health. Budapest And the World will come back better than ever. Jeremy"
hi Jeremy lovely see your smile hope you and family are well wish I could join you ilove jewish area do yopu know how get official news of airport closing as jet2 are still refusing to acknowledge I was told last flight hoping be back as soon as possible whats wesather temperature keep safe by the way my daughter lives in town centre in Scotland says it smells like country side as no heavy traffic thoughts from a windy day in lockdown blackpool now 10th week
"Jeremy, good to hear your report.Of course business are open to locals, maybe soon tourism from safe neighbours like Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia. But they will not make up for tourists lost from US and UK.In UK we still have an estimated 120k people with live infection on any given day. That's 1 in 500. 1 in 1000 maybe not showing symptoms.Is letting in a cohort where 0.1% will be unknowingly infected a good idea, guess not. That's someone on every fourth plane.I'm thinking no serious tourism this year. Much as I hate Orbán, he's managed Covid-19 well. But is he supporting vulnerable small businesses. In UK we have rates and taxes suspended, a scheme to pay 80% of suspended / furloughed staff wages until August. This is keeping many restaurants, small shops, hair salons solvent for time being."

"If the behaviour that I have observed in the last week outside bars and restaurants is anything to go by, we can expect a second wave here soon. I hope I am wrong.Social distancing ? what's that ?"
"Don't be afraid. Kovi is infectious respiratory disease on the same level of danger as flu. Flu epidemics happens time after time. 2017/18 flu epidemic take lifes of almost 100 thousands of Americans.After first panic many people and I myself came to such conclusions.Some say that it's new kind of flu.Without this scare magic of monitoring comparably small numbers of one particular disease we even don't noticed that there is kind of epidemic in our countries. Do it with the same level of testing and counting, and we will receive public epidemic of flu two times in every year.Edited: 6:25 am, May 27, 2020 "
"I wish that I could say your naivete does you credit.You may care to read this. https://www.bbc.com/news/52760992Edited: 4:49 pm, May 25, 2020 "
"RC, did Hungary really even have a first wave? My wife said there was an article where 5000 were given an antibody test. Three tested positive. This presumably means .06% of the population has ever had it. As much as a hate.orban's nationalistic tendencies, I bet those three people were foreigners.A friend of the family is a nurse...said hospitals were empty...in Budapest. Seems to me Hungary won't have a wave until tourists are allowed again.Wish I would've had the laptop for my new job shipped to Hungary rather than coming back to the states. Much better there.than here. In fact if I would have learned a covid test exempts you from quarantine on arrival, I would have flown back."
"Jeremy, out of curiosity, what are some of the restaurants which haven't made it?"
"Contrary. I'm everything except naive.:)My academic education and broad knowledge in propaganda, mass media manipulations, politics, history, statistics, medicine etc. etc. says that in the way how was treated this (call it if you want) pandemic, with all intentional panic rising and unnecessary monitoring by mass media, are clearly seen inadequacy and overreaction. It's mildly speaking.Edited: 4:40 am, May 26, 2020 "
"The USA's deaths - recorded deaths - from Covid-19 will shortly pass 100,000. This is in the equivalent of half a winter. This is nearly double the worst number of flu deaths in a whole year during the last decade, which between 2010 - 2019 varied between 12,000 and 61,000 (CDC figures). That is WITH lockdown.What would the numbers have been without lockdown ? one dreads to think, but if you call it overreaction, then you are being naive."
"Chris, are your family with you in the USA, or are they here and just you in the USA ?"
"Reality is that U.S. have flu epidemics regularly and, unfortunately, with big death numbers. Something a priori wrong with their medical system.As in other Western big countries. Their paracetamol- only (sarcasm) medicine isn't ready to deal with more serious diseases of epidemic kind.But Belarus and Sweden example shows that without compulsory restrictions we will have not much more deaths that with restrictions.We in LV with restrictions so far have 19 deaths with Kovi, counting all those who in fact died from other diseases.Last year by flu we have 86.deaths without restrictions. Honestly - we don't have even epidemic!Testing, counting and daily public monitoring of light cases and even so called sick-without-symptoms (absurdity from medical point of view) cause only panic.Why parallely isn't counted and daily monitored deaths from every other diseases? It will show that death numbers from this one are relatively low.And danger of Kovi isn't greater than from seasonal flu.Imagine, if governments will do all this severe fighting against respiratory diseases like flu and other korona viruses including Kovi, two times in year!Our normal life will be stopped and ruined because absurd motivation to save few! Every person is responsible for his own health. Disinfection, distancing and not going to big meetings of masses in times of influx is normal reaction.Specially, if one feels to be in group of risk."
The family remains there until end of school year and football camp...just bought a flight and we'll reunite in about a month.
"Kurlander, while I agree that this virus has been overblown, your education the US must be from Fox News. The virus is dangerous and hit far more people than any flu epidemic. Thanks to our.strong health system, it is anticipated we were able to keep the mortality rate to that of the flu, but when you consider the numberof people who caught it, the sheer number of people who have died.has.increased drastically. Most would attribute the number of people contracting the disease to failure to treat the disease seriously...no testing, no lockdowns or weak lockdowns in many cities.In the reverse, many expect orbans drastic and swift actions in Hungary were due to a sense that thehungarian health system.in no way could handle any surge in patients. Not wanting to be caught with their pants down, the authorities acted quickly and I've posted earlier how little the country has been affected.Edited: 9:40 am, May 26, 2020 "
"I tend to agree with overreaction and the role of mass media. In Hungary the measures were taken not really by the suggestion of doctors and scientists but as a result of public surveys, so the people wanted the closure of schools and the lockdown, the government didn't want it first.And by chance I found an older article some weeks ago, in January 2017 there were 5000 deaths due to flu (only in January, one month). Now, from March to May (more than 2 months) there were 500 deaths due to Covid. And due to the flu there is no restriction, no lockdown, no social distancing, nothing. Only sometimes some small articles in some hidden places in the news as a less important topic."
hi Jeremy do you know it dubarry are able to open I was there day Budapest had to close a wonderful view fantastic food a lovely memory of Budapest
Keeping my fingers crossed that we will arrive there in late August!
We are due to fly with Jet2 on the 3rd August and I reserved 2 restaurants and a rooftop bar for my 50th and husband birthday before Covid broke . Am just wondering if these bookings will still stand or even if these restaurants will have survived this pandemic. Also I don’t think it’s fair if we are forced to go if we are having to self distance and queue to get in bars or restaurants ☹️
You aren't forced to go...Is it fair that the airlines and hotels are forced to give you a refund because you don't like what mother nature has done? How entitled!!!
"Jeremy, I suspect I know which place your talking...we never got there...and I was hoping to celebrate my next job there. I wasn't really able to celebrate or drown my tears anywhere...many of my friends were trapped abroad or strictly maintaining distance...my farewell was a small breakfast. Maybe we'll revisit Budapest on the rebuilding when flats can be obtained cheaply (we're even looking to make an offer on the flat we rented) and the wages match the cost of living a little better. I had a great opportunity right before I left but felt it best to weather the storm stateside.Edited: 12:02 am, May 27, 2020 "
"durie, if the airline can provide you with the flight your only entitlement to cancel with refund is if UK government advises against travel, or destination country refuses to let you in as a UK arrival.For at least June / early July travel in and out of the UK will be impossible, as anyone returning will be subject to a 14 day strict quarantine.Check with airline, insurance, credit card provider for a refund if August is still impossible."
"Just want to say that the virus deniers here, like kurlander, are stupid and dangerous.Hungary has ridden the storm well by early lock down.My cousin's son and girlfriend work at the Pesti Úti Old People's Home where 305 residents and 45 staff tested positive, 42 residents died, not like seasonal flu at all.In UK we have over 60k excess deaths so far this year, that's nearly double average death rate over the epidemic months. 40k officially attributed to Covid-19.USA has 100k official deaths so far. Italy and Spain had epidemics which overwhelmed hospital capacity in regions, deaths per population like UK.Sweden which had a very soft lock down is slowly approaching UK like statistics for a very sparsely populated country. Brazil and Russia are set to explode, never mind Africa and India. This is not over by a long shot, looking at what's happening here there will be a huge second wave which will really finish off our much loved elderly folk, and many my age too. Deaths in UK equivalate to filling 150 wide bodied jets and crashing them all into a mountainside !"
"Hello Scottishlady,We walked the promenade a couple weeks ago and all those tourist restaurants were shuttered. I have a feeling they will begin opening again. We shall see. I’m happy you had a nice experience there, because as a local I simply walk by those places as I find them over priced with average food and experience. But....your experience tells a different story. Thanks for sharing. Jeremy"
hi Jeremy u cheer me up yeah I feel do the same here in blackpool when I get back perhaps u can give me insiders info on where to eat thanks for reply and all helpful info to me and all using forum keep safe
"Its great too see this country as said done well @ riding the storm UK now in 4th place we will see what happens as time goes on stay safe everyone.Edited: 3:07 pm, May 27, 2020 "
"Post 20 - Errrmmmm it’s either go or lose my £1000 and I didn’t pay this money to queue and social distance , this holiday was booked well before Covid broke , if I had a crystal ball then we wouldn’t be having this conversation now !!!"
"durie, if by 3rd August travel is still not possible because of UK or Hungarian regulations, Jet2 holidays will be obliged to refund your money, will be ABTA protected. Money if paid separately for accommodation should be refunded through agency or credit card charge back.If you do, manage to get to Hungary you should by August find most things back to normal, apart maybe from indoor concerts (never any anyway in Aug) and large outdoor festivals like Sziget.Will feel far less restricted than UK, relaxed, and much less swamped with tourists than usual !"

"Hi from Canada....so glad things are starting to open up over there. We are slowly doing the same, we are finally able to get out into parks and enjoy the nice weather. No restaurants yet, but some provinces are looking at opening them up. We are still looking forward to our visit next May and river cruise. Things will not be the same, but hopefully still enjoyable.Good to see everyone is coping well, let's hope by the time (if and when) a 2nd wave hits, we are all better prepared."
"Thanks Laura these are helpful comments.I know I will be ok for a refund if Jet2 do cancel my package as my holiday to Italy was cancelled back in April and Jet2 refunded all my money we no question, I was really impressed and fingers crossed by August things will be better.I have already pre-booked 3 restaurants so hopefully these will be open but I will drop them an email nearer the time."
Thank you for taking the time to post Bela! I'm still hopeful we'll make our first trip there at the end of August.
"IMHO we now live in two different worlds - ones concerned about this one virus with much words, and others looking when borders will be opened to go on their usual summer trip.:)Edited: 3:41 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"The quarantine rule introduced in Hungary was the weakest on this planet-----Hungarian quarantine rule in no way was the weakest.In the world broadly was two types of quarantines - more mild, where peoples was allowed go out for walking with families (as ours in LV), exercising etc. and, I will call it plainly - covidiotic, where they was forced to stay at home, which is nonsense who only ruins immunity. But both types of quarantines in other restrictions was very similar. And their effect on economics. The weakest rule is in Belarus, where they have practically no quarantine.And no one can even see there epidemic.Edited: 4:00 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"By the way, here is a new survey of what people in Hungary think of the virus and government actionshttps://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/20200602/m…"
"Are there any limitations on business hours of restaurants and bars, i.e. do they have to close earlier than usual or are they allowed to be open normally? Thank you!"
"Bela, Thank you for the excellent update. We were supposed to go this May and have rebooked for Mid Sept. Not sure if that will happen trying to be hopefully be realistic at the same time."
"Hi,Strictly for the time being all the shops, restaurants/cafes are allowed to do business as usual, however this doesn't mean they all doing so.Quite a few restaurants/cafes still stay closed. Some, very fortunately lousy tourist traps, but also unfortunately a few good ones, decided not to open and wait for the better times, AKA tourists returns. Its easy to understand them: limited number of seating, regulations concerning disinfection, A/C usage, constant heavy cleaning (every 2 hours or so), plexiglass screens, you name it. You kinda mostly work for peoples safety and to meet government requirements but where is the profit then?Same applies to stores. At least quarter of them at my local mall still stay closed, some stay open mostly till 4-6 pm instead of the usual 8-9pm. This is very typical of the travel agencies, exchange booths, ice cream parlors, florists etc. At the same time all the big international chains are open as usual and FLOODED with the EVER whining Hungarians (AKA we don't have money and the economy is so bad). Yesterday had to go to a big home supplies department store to buy some spare parts for a broken kitchen faucet and the parking lot was full, as well as the store. Guess what, people where buying fancy trampolines, surfboards, sunshades, garden pavilions, fancy (but extremely kitsch) ""antique"" looking artificial waterfalls/wells. You know the MOST important things during a pandemic and very hard financial times... The nearby Aldi, Tesco and Auchan's parking lots were also jammed and tons of people in the stores.Also but correct me if I am wrong, the night bars and clubs have to shut down earlier, like midnight or os. However not sure about that. Dear government plans to stop the so called emergency situation on June 20 and from then on there should be no limitations. Public gatherings of over 500 people will be allowed from August 15th. I go fishing almost every day (since there are no tourists to guide through Budapest or Hungary I have tons of extra time. But than at least, I save ""tons"" of money on food supplying the family with excellent, super fresh Danube fish:)) ) and I remember for more than a month that was ONE SINGLE plane flying above my head at around 10 pm (I mean taking off from Budapest airport). Just ONE!!! In the last few days there were at least a dozen every evening (I mean at my spot of observation, where they make a 90-180 degrees turn after take off), so looks like the airport was also back to their usual routine. However most optimistic predictions talk about a maximum of 30% of last years tourism figures, at best!All in all if there will be no second wave (fingers crossed) by late August/Early September everything should be back to normal. If we can call anything normal nowadays:(("
"Bela, do you think that Hungarians are the only ones ignoring quarantine guidance? Note how many times the mayor of Chicago yelled at the citizens to honor quarantine. I don't think this is just true in the US...it's likely true everywhere totalitarian governments don't exist. In fact, I found Hungarians were far more compliant than Americans. The articles I read are unclear, but it sounds like District VII took this as an opportunity to put in permanent restrictions on bars and clubs to close at 12:00. Don't quote me on this, but be prepared that the Party Quarter may not be open all night."
Bela are you a tour guide?
"Hey CP,From my experiences every early morning across the quarantine, the streets were almost empty. On my short drive, there were many mornings that I didn’t see more than a dozen cars when on an usual morning I’d see 100+. And the city sidewalks were empty from pedestrians for the most apart across the 45ish days of official quarantine. These are my experiences in I, XII, and city center. So, as I mentioned earlier I believe we did a nice job of staying in and leveraging masks as directed. And now? Unfortunately, traffic has picked back up, although not enough yet to throw the brown smog cloud over the city (it has been a bit windy). And the days of many mask wearers appear to be gone (public transport may be different). I just read an article about how most Michelin Star restaurants remain closed for now, and other fine dining and long time establishments are gone. Restaurants in the rural areas are also up for sale. Tough to see the “good ones” shutting down. Good riddance the touristy rip-offs. As a local and traveler, I’m happy to see the slowdown, albeit I don’t like how we arrived here. The city center was largely overrun with tourists and those making money from the industry. I have no issues to either, although it made living in the center less and less enjoyable. I hope the tourists come back, just at a slow pace, as I hope the local governments can use this time to balance benefits for both locals and tourists. Best,Jeremy"
"Bela, thanks for your answer :)One more thing - we're coming to Budapest for this weekend. Is parking on street still free (even in the city centre)? We're trying to avoid the public transportation until mask requirement is dropped, so we will be using car all the way to the city centre.Edited: 7:36 am, June 04, 2020 "
"Yes, which is why it is hard to find somewhere to park....."
"Linda, Bela doesn't like to advertise his wares, so I will do it for him. Yes, he is a tour guide, with extensive knowledge of Hungary AND surrounding countries."
Thank you. We'll use garage then. Don't want to be a burden to locals :)
"Roman, Thank you..."
"Yes parking is free almost everywhere in Hungary (99%) till the end of June. Have to repeat it again, but this was the ONE and ONLY positive thing our PM did in ALL his entire life, besides working for 2 months at his local coop, back in the 80-s:))"
"No, it wasn't at all, it was not a good decision and it was against the cities, especially against Budapest. His only positive thing was the ban of public smoking :)"
"Wonder what is happening to those who invested small fortunes into now empty Airbnb apartments ?Is the government helping with interest on their loans ?Ask because for a while now I've rented apartments to give me an independent base rather than squeeze in with family. When UK citizens are allowed back into the country (guess we'll be together with USA amongst the last), will the choice be drastically reduced, or will I have an amazing choice because of slow recovery of tourism ?Will there be some fantastic real estate deals because of foreclosures ..."
"Still it was an AMAZING decision (free parking), that has made life at least a bit less miserable in the days of this plague!!! The BEST ever. Concerning smoking, well just to let you know, but it was regulated by the EU (then adopted by almost all its members) and not by a single piece of an eastern european scumbag."
"As a local I really hope most of the Airbnbs will bankrupt and either they will sell the flats or change it to long term rent for locals. Besides the low cost airlines Airbnb is the biggest responsible for the awful conditions that were in all big cities before this situaion. And I really hope we won't return to it, mass tourism will change back to normal tourism.Bela, yes, the smoking ban was an EU initiative, but it was not mandatory to implement it that time (see for example Austria, they implemented it last year only) and as you also mentioned almost all countries adopted it (that means not all of them). I absoulely can imagine that the free parking is good for the car drivers, of course, but for nobody else: it's not good for the cities, the local governments and for the people who live there. Living on the Nagykorut I could easily see it, the immediate growth of the traffic. And they took away a hell of money from the cities, the local governments, especially from the inner districts of Budapest, without compensation. So it's very selfish from the car drivers to say it's the best decision."
"Eva, Don't want to disappoint you, but the relatively cheaper flats have been rented out for long term. Now the prices are slowly gong up again. Also many owners now prefer the long rent thus there will be a shortage of short term accommodation. I mean in the future, after tourists will be back again, definitely not this year. ALSO, don't forget that Hungarian economical activity/ethics is still as primitive as it was a 1,000 years ago. Like all our public beaches, swimming ponds raised the prices for this season from 10 up to 60%¡!!!!!! Kinda promoting domestic travels. I liked when a brainless creature AKA boss of one Balaton Beach, told the reporter: ""We had 50% less customers, so we had to raise the prices by 60%!!! Sometimes (after extensively travelling the world) I wonder how this countries economy functions at all. My son, who is now for 6 years in the UK, sometimes shocked of our economical regulations/laws observing them from a much civilized (sokkal boldogabb) country.Concerning the loanes and banks, no sweat. 60-70% of Airbnbs belong to foteigners. Mostly, Israeli, Chinese, Russian, British, French, some American as well, etc. The rest, that is owned by Hungarians, is paid for!!! I personally know people who have those apartments and it was all either a bank transfer or quite a few times even cash. Also 90-95% have been brought 4-6 years ago, for quarter of today's prices. A friend from Tunisia bought an apartment near the Várkert kioszk for 500,000HUF/square meter 4 years ago. So please, don't cry tears of blood for those ""poor"" creatures:))"
"Just got back from 2-night stay in Budapest. It's a very nice place to visit now that it's not overcrowded.What I found most intriguing was the stark contrast between honest businesses and tourist traps. The former were quite busy, buzzing (mostly) with locals, while the latter were dead empty (even despite some of them offering up to 50 percent discounts - makes you wonder what their profit margin is). On the same street it was possible to see packed restaurants with no tables available, as well as empty ones without a single customers.This made it very easy to decide where to go :)Edited: 3:28 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"Béla, thanks for your informative reply.My airbnb two years back was owned by a 30-something Hungarian woman, was only rented out for 18 months, and was very obviously her comfy home. Maybe off on business secondment. Handy 3 min walk to Pillangó Utca metro + really close to family.Last year, near Garay Píac, again Hungarian owned huge secessionist apartment, too well appointed and fitted out to be for a rental business.I guess many apartments come from inheritance from single child families as was the norm pre-1990. Certainly the case in my family.Can't see that long term rental is profitable compared to short holiday lettings, so as sure as night follows day these apartments will be back on airb&b when annual lease expires and tourism has recovered.Budapest really isn't swamped with holiday apartments, not like Barcelona, Edinburgh or Prague, and most are very much in the city centre ... I struggle to find anything convenient for Zugló (one mile walk, single bus / trolley) and also easy for the city centre.Also I've never felt Budapest is overwhelmed with tourists, its a large city and places tourists crowd is not where people live, shop or work. And they keep so many restaurants, bars, nightlife in profit, pay people's wages, not where I normally spend my money but without them most fine dining places would not exist."
"The810,Was everything open, spas, museums, churches ?Indoor restaurants and bars. Ruin pubs, but how they work without tourists is questionable. We're there any social distancing precautions, venue capacity rules ?"
"I'm not sure about museums and similar places - we mostly walked outside (I suppose even if museums were open, we would have to wear a face mask, which is a no-go) and enjoyed the scenery. When it comes to restaurants and pubs, some places were closed but every place we wanted to visit was open, so this wasn't an inconvenience to us.There are queues in front of some shops due to limited number of customers inside but there don't seem to be any limitation for gastronomy services. Especially bars we visited in evenings were very busy and packed with people."
"Single child was the norm pre-1990?!? I didn't really notice it. I have two brothers, all my friends, schoolmates, relatives, parents had brothers, sisters. I've known only a very few single child (egyke, as it was called).I live in district 7, so I have first hand experince about overtourism. Maybe you don't notice it if your accomodation is in the suburb and go to the downtown for a few hours only, but in the everyday life it was very noticeable (and was annoying) at the end. At the beginning, 5-10 years ago I had no problem with it at all, but in the last one or two years it was awful. And there were also some (economical) articles in the last time, that it's not sure anymore, that the benefit is much bigger than the loss it causes on the other side."
"kbsz,I'm thinking of people inheriting in last ten years, people around 60, and born around 1960.Between 1956 and 1973 there were more legal abortions in Hungary than live births !Hungary had one of the lowest birth rates in Europe. My parent's generation of aunts and uncles within a large family produced less than one child per couple. Yes over tourism can be painful for residents, but in Budapest it's really not obtrusive apart from some belvárosi streets and well known party areas. Outside Erzsébet and József körút You hardly see a single tourist in the evening. Likewise kerület I & II. Honestly it's tourists who keep some of our favourite restaurants in profit, why the National Gallery can put on some decent exhibitions (there are many cultured tourists too). Sure likes of Rosenstein, Opera, MŰPA, Nemzeti Színház would still thrive without tourists, indeed better than many London venues as Budapest has a thriving cultural life, but honestly tourism is no more disruptive of local life than London which has 20 million annual tourists vs 4.6 for Budapest. Pity Prague and Barcelona with 9 million tourists each ..."
"Over tourism “....not really obtrusive” In Budapest. Says someone living in another country, that has no daily feel of the significant changes our visitors have for those tens of thousands of residents who live in city center. There are days I cannot walk down the sidewalk at any pace due to tourists enjoying our city. Try and drive into Buda on the Chain Bridge and watch the car back-up due to our visitors crossing the streets coming into Clark-Adam tér. Attempt to call ahead on hour or two into a local favorite haunt for a table and you’ll be highly disappointed. Again - I’m a traveler, but because of the massive influx of travelers into Budapest the past years, I now better understand how I may be viewed by locals when visiting other cities, and it is having an impact on my travel selections and habits. Please continue to enjoy beautiful Budapest. But to say there is no obtrusive impact for locals, is to have little idea what is happening here. JeremyEdited: 4:28 am, June 08, 2020 "
"I agree with Jeremy and the tourism is not limited to within the Nagykorut...I lived and worked outside the nagykorut and the impact of tourists was still significant. As AirBnb grew, more and more tourists start moving outside the tourist areas. Additionally, Google maps, Google translate and the like make it easier to move further afield. I recognize there are few tourists in Obuda or Orz Vezer Tere...but my coworkers (exclusively Hungarian) frequented places within the tourist area and many lived there. So I think the area influenced by tourists is far larger than you think and the number of locals in the tourist area is also far larger than you give credit. Furthermore, the restaurants in the tourist area are far superior to outside the city center with few exceptions, and as Jeremy said, it's become exponentially hard to get into restaurants the last year or two."
"""Also I've never felt Budapest is overwhelmed with tourists, its a large city and places tourists crowd is not where people live, shop or work.""But this is the problem. Locals in many major European cities stopped going to the city centre, because it was essentially claimed by tourists. Locals are supposed to be living, shopping and working in what became tourists areas - it's their city and their city centre. When it becomes tourist-only, it's bad for everyone, including those tourists."
"Jeremy, it's unfair to say I'm unqualified to comment because I don't live in Hungary.I'm a native speaker, so have a different experience to an American ex-pat. I speak to my family most days and feel the zeitgeist. I've travelled to Budapest and beyond most years since being a teenager, that's from the mid 70s. My first two visits were 1965 and 1969 as a kid. So I've seen the huge changes, driven there in family cars, own car. Borrowed cars and hire cars when it was cheaper and easier to fly.Not sure how far you'd like to turn back the tourism clock ? 1980s when I could eat in the finest restaurants for not much more than a UK hamburger meal, Száz éves, Albárdos, Mátyás Pince, Buda Hilton. Food wasn't great. 1990s, things improving on food and bar scene, music clubs in abandoned basements well predating ruin pubs. 2000s, when mass tourism really kicks off, but Gozsdu Udvar derelict and Jewish quarter still residential. 2010s when tourism became big business, luxury hotels, city as theme park, money and tourism bringing in Michelin star kind of food for those foolish enough to spend 100 euro on a meal. But I still maintain that tourism is still not a parasite on Budapest. I doubt if even 100k of 2 million live in seriously tourist affect areas, and with crazy property prices in belváros why not sell up if it annoys you so much ? None of your favourite belvárosi restaurants could survive without 60% tourist trade, so book your table a few days in advance. Honestly, look at Amsterdam, Prague, Barcelona, Firenze, Venezia, where they really do have problems ... Budapest copes with its tourist like Paris, London, Rome; a bit of annoyance, but contained into a small area. Supports nearly 400,000 Hungarian tourism dependent jobs, servicing 17 million annual visitor nights in a city of 2 million (www.statista.com), so 50k daily visitors in mid season, like an Arsenal, Spurs, Man City football crowd.What's the gripe with tourists ? Hardly see them in places I go, metro, or on bus. They don't crowd me off pavement / sidewalk. They do their touristy stuff, get fleeced in sub par restaurants, but they're happy. Honestly I really don't understand all this hate on tourists in a tourist forum."
