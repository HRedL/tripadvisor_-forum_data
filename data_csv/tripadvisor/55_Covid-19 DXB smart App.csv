"Going to Dubai for a holiday on 18th July, which I booked back in October, and required to download and complete the COVID-19 smart app on my phone before arriving in Dubai. My issue is that I can’t get passed the first page on the app as it won’t let me add a UK number so the app is basically useless at this point. Anyone know how to get the app working or if they’ve been to Dubai is the last few days without completing the app and if they’ve been given any trouble at the airport because of this."
"How are you trying to input a U.K. phone number., in what format, and is it for your mobile, or a U.K. landline, please ?"
"It doesn’t allow you to change the area code to +44, it’s stuck on 971. Trying to add my mobile number."
Hi I arrived on the 7thNo one in the airport asked to see the app Thanks
"@ Mr One - did you manage to set up the app with an international number, or do you have a local SIM?How did you get your results?Hope the Gevora is working out well for you..."
Hi Shaun I set the app afterwards when I bought a sim Just outside the arrivals but I don’t think it’s a must to have the app active The results are sent to the number which you give just before immigration at the airport even if it’s your local uk number the results will be sent to you by text as long as your number is on If not you can log into their website and it tells you the result You need dob and passport number
Gevora is perfect for my needs and priced very reasonable too I must say it also has the best pool area compare to the other hotels I’ve stayed at on the main szr
"Mrone Z - Hi,Did you arrive as a tourist from the UK?Also what did they ask for in terms of test.. Certificate or will and email / text suffice? Lastly have you insurance that covers you for Covid.I cannot find any as the FCO have still not classed it as safe so all insurance seems to be void..Please any advise is welcomed.I fly to DXB on 22nd July....Edited: 5:32 pm, July 11, 2020 "
Hi yes arrived as a tourist I took the test at dxb airport I wasn’t planning on taking any insurance it was only when at the emirates counter at LHR that they was asking for it I quickly just a took a random policy online so they would give me the boarding card they didn’t look for specifics on the policy
Hello they asked me to download the app on arrival and the immigration officer even gave me a dubai sim so I could activate the app with a local number...
"Most policies will cover covid while away, it just won’t cover cancellation or curtailment is all. I’m going over on the 16th of August"
"I was able to change the area code but it will not let me input a 10 digit US phone number. Which is completely stupid since I was able to select United States as my area code. They have limits on the number of digits you can input so it is useless.Edited: 7:56 am, July 17, 2020 "
"Arrived yesterday at Dubai airport.They were very well organized and we were out of the airport under one hour from arrival, which is fast for Dubai.They only made a pcr test ( free of charge ) and collected one form, which was given to me in the airplane.Nobody asked for the app and for insurance.Now waiting at home for the test result and then I will go out"
Negative test result just arrived appx 14 hours after test.Received by SMS on my phone
"Thats good news Realistic_Review1, thanks for the update.Hope you have a good trip"
what documentation have you got and how was uour journey as we are hoing again in Sept Did you have the test prior to travelling Thankyou
@realistiv_view was this just an NHS which you did for Covid-19 or when you got to Dubai? How much did it cost if in Dubai and the Quarantine was at your hotel or in a state facility?
"@The Russelling - You don't 'need' to test as you leave the UK. As a UK resident on route to Dubai, you will need to have a swab test when you reach Dubai. This is provided free of charge.I can't legitamise the comments, but on a few travel type twitter feeds, quite a few are mentioning that even though they have had a test in the UK, some NHS/some private (presumably within the 96hr window), these weren't even looked at. They were mentioned to staff at DXB airport, but were basiclly ignored and were instructed to take the test at the airport anyway.."

"How did your trip go , did you get tested at the airport and if so did you have to stay in hotel room whilst you waited for the results?What was the cost as I'm being charged 195 per person in England?Also did anyone take kids, if so do you need to complete the 2 forms for them?"
Oh how long did the test results take?
I was able to get my results after downloading DHA app from Appleor Android storeSelect COVID 19 bannerChoose COVID test resultsScroll down toScreening resultsEnter Passport #
Hi Nicole have you travelled and hope you reached safely. We are planning to travel on 24 can you please let us know the process with immigration with COVID test and app. Also is it mandatory for infant and children under 12 years.
"I was just about to book a trip from Chicago to Dubai but came here first. If someone knows the answer to this, can you let me know:Do I have to bring a negative COVID test result with me for travel?or are you tested at the airport, regardless of you testing negative in your home country?From reading, it seems like you take the test and then go to your hotel to await results, which seems you get within 10-14 hrs. As long as its negative you're allowed to move around. So I'm just trying to see if I have already tested negative, do you get tested again at the airport?And what insurance is needed? My husband and I both have health insurance. Do we need to bring a copy of that? What others are needed?"
The smart app is now working. You can input the country and all your phone number digits
"Thank you Shaun, since you're there can you update this thread when there is a clear understanding."
How can I I rebhy and how match it cost and if I don't reply and I want know how much it cost to pay for take care if I get kovid19
"Osama - ""in the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, come again?""If you are asking how much it will cost for care under Covid-19, who knows - but likely, a lot. At the very least, you've to commit to undertaking all costs inc. the accommodation which is at least $50 per day.Even if you have good insurance cover, you may need funds to access healthcare as you *may* not be able to have pre-authorisation for funding. In other words, ""no money, no honey"" - you 'pay upfront' to be treated.PS. 'rebhy' ??"
"Does the app have to be downloaded on all family members phones, or can it be put on just one phone per family?"

"How long does it take for the DBX app to show your results? I received my text message (about five hours ago) that shows I have a negative result, but the DBX app says that my results are still pending. Does anybody have any experience with this?My girlfriend told the man at the counter who registers your testing information that we would be using the same phone number. He said this was okay. We took the test at the same time and she has yet to get her results by text. Her app also still says results are pending. Has anybody used the same phone number to register two people on arrival?Hope to hear from somebody soon!Thanks"
Hi Mrone Can you tell me in which website I can check my test result?
Good morning ma'am I'm gilson abucayon swab test August 9 airport Dubai waiting for result
"@ Gilson, this is Trip Advisor Dubai Forum; we didn't swab you nor have your results. You need to check the app and/or paperwork given when you screened or arrived."
To dubai?
"Ebtisam in #38,Is there something Tripadvisor members can help you with, because If so, it would be appreciated if you would supply details of the nature of your enquiry.Regards"
"Just checking in case of an update, how is the App downloadable for UK visitors if you can't input a UK phone number? And I read a while ago it needs to be open/connected all the time supposedly requiring roaming to be on 24/7, is this true?"
"Hello,Starting August 1, all travelers from USA to Dubai are required to show a negative COVID test results prior to boarding.A lot of the clinics i call inform me that it will take 4-10 days for PCR result to come back.Is an ANTIGEN test good enough for proof? It is also a type of Molecular test, it just takes 15 min to return results.Has anyone had a recent experience while boarding that can share please?Thanks"
"Hi ziad h, all information so far states that the COVID-19 test used must be a ""PCR"" test. This is not the ""rapid antigen"" test and is also not the ""antibody"" test for COVID-19. The PCR test is the current gold standard."
