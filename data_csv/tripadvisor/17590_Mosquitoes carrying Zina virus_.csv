"Looking forward to our arrival on June 30Wondering how the mosquitos situation is at this time of yearAny news of mosquitoes carrying zika,dengue ?CDC issuing a warning to potentially pregnant women(which I definitely am not)but I do seem to be a mosquito magnet We do have west Nile in our area in the summer but not serious yetUsual precautions of spray,coverup esp at dusk avoiding ""jungle"" ,etc should be helpfulAny news?"
"I haven't looked it up, but I know some people have gotten Dengue in the PV area. It's not like it's rampant though, it just means it's not impossible. I'm not a magnet so no bites in December. As far as getting very many bites it's going to be the no-see-ums that you have better chances of being a target. I never saw a mosquito in 3 weeks. Just use repellent if you're around a lot of foliage. Some people cover up, but I don't. 3 of us went on a 4 hour hike in the jungle, we used repellent and none of us got bit. If repellent never helps you, then that's another story!"
"I doubt it the report mentions Central and South America, nothing about North America. The usual over reaction, I'm afraid. 3 cases reported in Mexico and one had travelled from Colombia ! not exactly an epidemic !"
"Try vitamin B6,9 and 12 or a B complex. It helps. There is a nice smelling cream here in PV that seems to work wonders as well. It is called ""Fight The Bite"" Available at the Saturday market in old town."
Given the results of this virus on pregnant women or women intending on becoming pregnant I don't find it an over reaction. http://www.vallartadaily.com/living/health/u-s-issues-travel-alert-over-zika-virus-in-mexico/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+VallartaDaily+%28Vallarta+Daily%29
"I realize it's not an epidemic just looking for some info like others have given me,not snarky commentsActually Mexico was on the CDC list and this is the first time I've noticed a CDC warning like thisCases in Hawaii, one had travelled to BrazilThanks to others who have some useful info"
"Everyone has their own comfort level with risks, but personally, due to the extremely low incidence of mosquito borne illness in PV, I am confident with a good conscientious application of bug repellent. If you are hiking through the jungle or visiting a farm....apply protection often, and wear protective clothing.If you avoided every place where there is a bit of risk, you'd never leave home.You are wise to educate yourself and act accordinglyEdited: 4 years ago "
Thanks I am widely travelled and not afraid just like to know what's happening where I'm goingAlso finding the whole insect profusion because of climate change interestingThanks for the info
"Actually last trip Oct/Nov 2015 I had so many bites from no-see-um that took a few days to develop and then months of infected bites before they were gone.We just got back early this morning (stayed at the Hyatt) within minutes last Saturday After using deep woods off I was bitten by mosquitos (saw them)I woke up the next day with huge welts and tried using my trusted Gelicam not a whole lot of relief (compared to last trip)Tuesday I went into to see Freddie on Olas Atlas and tried to buy more Gelicam he looked at the biggest bites (10 at this point) shook his head and said, no just a few no see ums mostly mosquito bites that were getting infected. He sold me a 2.5 cortisone cream that really helped for a few days. Thursday we went back and I showed him the first bites and 10 more. He said I was far too sweet and the mosquitos loved me. Benadryl helped me sleep at night. I don't usually see the bugs that love me but this trip? At least ten of the twenty bites were mosquitoes"
"Do the CDC have a warning out about Hawaii ? Really, one case in Chiapas one in Nuevo Leon, since the mosquito is the vector, it would have to bite one of those two people and fly all the way to PV.Better watch out for the cobbles and the uneven pavements than worry unduly about this."
Bahahaha sorry JR I was trying to edit my post but you beat me to it I get infected by mosquitoes up here in BC so I am not worried about being bit down in PVYes I warned our guests (who had no bites) about watching out for cobbles and uneven pavement We showed them so much of PV that their next visit will be a condo
Apparently there's now a case in Texas.
"so which insect repellent is the best one to get against zikai heard any ""off "" product is not good"
"Don't know where you 'heard' that, I've been using the local ""OFF"" for many, many, years here and it's very good."
"linatoday where did you hear that, do you have a link? Some people say certain products never work for them no matter the insect, but another person will experience the opposite. Maybe that's what you heard, just someone's opinion."
"""so which insect repellent is the best one to get against zika""Anything with DEET! 30% is usually sufficient.If I were pregnant, no way would I travel anywhere with cases of Zika right now-no matter how tiny the risk, it's simply not worth it to have a vacation. If not pg, I would go for sure. My husband had Dengue and he still travels-it is not pleasant but you can't stop living life!"
"my friend who lives in brazil sao paulo, she said her family, her neighbors, her friends, other families from her children's school friends have used ""keep Off"" and they get bitten anyway, so she has stopped using it, (she still has it on her shelf) and the only thing that works is something called ""exposis.""Edited: 4 years ago "
but i can't find the active ingredient for it online

"not sure why a soap would help against zika, i asked about an insect repellent ,so looks like active ingredient is ""icaridin"" or ""picaridina"" or KBR3023 (piperidinecarboxylic acid, hydroxyethyl, methylpropylester) according to wikipedia.i would have to now go and shop for something with this active ingredient, unless anyone else has already done so, used and saw it helped.i know one person above has mentioned off works, looks like on amazon they have picaridin, which is what i will most likely buy for my trip to mexico."
"FYI microcephaly affects 25,000 children in the USA every year - WHO"
"and just found on cdcWhen used as directed on the product label, insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, and IR3535 are safe for pregnant women. wear light and long sleeve shirt and pants. Further guidelines for using insect repellents are available online (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites see below)FOR PROTECTION AGAINST MOSQUITOES ONLY: Products with one of the following active ingredients can also help prevent mosquito bites. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection.DEETPicaridin (also known as KBR 3023, Bayrepel, and icaridin. Products containing picaridin include Cutter Advanced, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, and Autan [outside the US])Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or PMD (Products containing OLE include Repel and Off! Botanicals)IR3535 (Products containing IR3535 include Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus Expedition and SkinSmart)Always follow product directions and reapply as directed.If you are also using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and insect repellent second.Follow package directions when applying repellent on children. Avoid applying repellent to their hands, eyes, and mouth.Consider using permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.Treated clothing remains protective after multiple washings. See the product information to find out how long the protection will last.If treating items yourself, follow the product instructions carefully.Do not use permethrin directly on skin."
Before our trip to PV I tried doing something that I read about on this forum. I was very concerned because I am prone to getting bites.I read that taking Vtamine D and garlic pills for 2 weeks before a trip would give protection against bites. I tried doing this and it worked for me and my fiancée.
So what's your point?Sure we don't want to have 50000 cases right?In PV now and haven't had any mosquitoes even at night in wooded area so that's good.Take precautions...
My point was that I thought I would pass on helpful information that worked for me and my fiancée.
"Thanks Phyllis, any personal experience is worth considering. :-)"
"I do believe Maryellen was responding to JR's post about how the US gets 25,000 cases of microcephaly a year....."
"Someone must be awfully busy deleting / removing posts on here today........NOTHING BETTER TO DO??? Or Do you feel offended? WHY? I see many on here that are just short of 'swearing' will, using not so nice terminology........but Not bothering me enough to remove their post...........daaaaaa"
