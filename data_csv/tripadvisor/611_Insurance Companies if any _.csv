"Well, the 'advice' such as it is coming out of Dubai is constantly in flux it seems. Add to that, there are some elements of the protocols for tourists that need clarifying still, especially things like quarantine measures if tested at the airport.You *may* not have to actually show proof of medical insurance, but you will be expected to commit to a) having it and b) agreeing to abide by all regulations and liabilities for bills. I'd always suggest 'safety first' and ensuring you have all documentation 'just in case' though and especially check the small print of any policies for things like excesses or if you'd have to pay first then claim later. It could be the case should you need treatment then you may have to pay 'up front' or settle your bill before you're allowed to leave Dubai.This article may help to explain a little about the impacts of FCO advice and COVID-19 and what insurers are doing about them.https:/…In theory, you can get cover for anything, but you'll likely pay a premium for it.If it helps, you're really looking to cover a few risks, such as :-* expenses, cancellation and travel costs should anything be impacted (e.g. flight, hotels etc.)* medical care and cover* extension of travel/delay Ultimately it will be a case of balancing the risk of paying to cover the present scenario as it is today, waiting a couple of weeks to so if anything changes, or taking the risk of having no or insufficient cover.PS The FCO advice was due to be updated today (the 4th) following yesterday's announcement, and likely it will only be amended for the 59 countries (of which UAE is not one).Edited: 9:34 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Staysure are offering a policy with some elements of Covid19 cover......https:/…Edited: 12:34 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"But they will not offer any cover if you travel against FCO advice.Some people have existing policies with platinum or gold bank accounts and they cover travel against FCO advice, however, my understanding that the cover only applies to existing customers and has been closed to new customers."
"There are, but the general advice is to have insurance in place before travelling from the home country.It's a personal opinion, but I'd suggest you'd have a wider choice and better clarity on the conditions/exclusions taking insurance from a home country. https:/…healthhttps://gulfnews.com/uae/travel-insurance-or…"
"Have received this information from emirates and it’s on the Dubai visit site too: Ensure you have medical travel insurance before traveling, in the event you do not have international coverage. Sign a declaration to bear all costs of quarantine and treatment and complete the Health Declaration Form before departure to ensure the passenger has no COVID-19 symptoms. So I could still travel without insurance. I had the virus back in April and took a private antibody test in May. So I’m confident the covid tests done before or at Dubai airport would come back negative.Edited: 6:34 am, July 05, 2020 "
"Yes I have seen this too - I spoke to Emirates twice today and they confirmed that as long as I am happy to sign the declaration, I can travel without insurance (as others have said, it's impossible to purchase it in the UK at the moment)."
"I a DXB - I see you have recovered from Covid-19. Thats great.You realise that insurance coverage is for other things that can cause medical bills etc and you won't be covered? A lip next to the pool, tripping on the pavement, loosing your bags, laptop being damaged, or worse?I hope you won't have any issues but I think its silly not to have coverage when travelling..Edited: 8:49 am, July 05, 2020 "
"With all due respect, this is exactly the challenge Dubai is posing - differing communications. The official protocols still stand, yet there are 2 other websites each with a slightly different copy rather than exactly the same message.So yes, you're correct - Visit Dubai and the Emirates page both suggest you don't need travel or medical insurance, so long as you accept responsibility for any costs.I'm unsure why there isn't a consistent message, especially as the original advice a) didn't suggest you couldn't have insurance and b) still requires you to accept responsibility and sign the Health Declaration Form. Perhaps Dubai thinks it may put people off travelling, but whatever the reason, doesn't mean it's a good idea to risk it.We're not talking a day trip to Blackpool on a coach here. The UAE health care is extremely expensive, and you're expected to have upfront costs available to pay (even with insurance) in many cases. More to the point, should things go South and you do run up bills, you'd be unlikely to be allowed to leave the country before settling.The FCO advice is there for good reason, and don't overlook the fact that the comms from Dubai could also change again.Safe travel however you choose to go and do let us know your feedback."
"Sean R u are absolutely right need some kind of insurance without fco advice change this can’t happen here, looking into basic emergency cover for accident insurance cover in Dubai at the moment."
"I completely agree @Sean and I’m only considering this because I need to urgently visit family. It’s not even a holiday unfortunately. But agreed, everyone should try and have some coverage whenever traveling no matter what the circumstances. I did find some uk insurers that offer coverage (excluding Covid) against FCO advice which some of you may want to check out if you’re determined to travel regardless: campbellirvinedirect.comhighriskvoyager.com I’m considering taking out one of these policies in the hope it’ll cover me for everything else..."
Just a thought - if you are travelling to see/stay with family is it worth checking to see if you can be added to their policy whilst in town?
"DubaiViennaLondonBefore you make travel insurance recommendations to others please make sure that you are factually correct. Neither Campbell Irvine Ltd nor High risk voyager are insurance companies. Campbell Irvine's policy is underwirtten by AWP P&C SA, which is a German company and their standard travel policy does not cover travel against FCO advice.The insurer shall not pay (unless agreed in writing by or on behalf of the insurer) for any claim directly orindirectly caused by, arising or resulting from, or in connection with:10 You travelling to a country, specific area or event to which the Travel Advice unit of the BritishForeign and Commonwealth Office or the World Health Organisation has advised against all travelor all but essential travel, unless agreed by or on behalf of the insurer.In order to get cover when you travel against FCO advice then you have to have that in writing from the insurer and pay the extra premium required.High RIsk Voyager is a brand name. The agent for it is called Voyager Insurance Services Ltd and the underwriter is ""certain underwriters at Lloyd's"", so at least that is UK based.Their website clearly states the following informationNOTE REGARDING CORONA VIRUS COVID-19 DECLARED PANDEMIC - Effective 12th March 2020 - We can provide High Risk Voyager Travel Insurance for travel to countries and regions where either the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) or local authority equivalent or the World Health Organisation (WHO) have placed travel restrictions. For more information on Territorial Zones please refer to the help sets () on the right hand side when selecting your Territorial Zone on Desktop devices and the button on mobile devices in the 'Quote Details' section when getting a quote.Please Note - However, due to the Corona Virus / COVID-19 Pandemic being declared - there is no cover for Corona Virus if you are travelling to an area where there is an FCO travel restriction due to Corona Virus on or before your date of purchase.The above policy is designed to cover war reporters and charity volunteers in high risk areas - not for people wanting to visit relatives in Dubai and as stated on their website there is no cover for Covid 19.I'm pointing all of this out because it may interest you but also as a warning to others that may read your post that your information is incorrect on various points."
Versatile Insurance is a broker not an insurance company so they are only licensed to sell an insurers product - they are not licensed as an insurer.This means that any claim will be handled byanother third party.Before you buy it ask for a sample policy wording and check out who the actual insurer or underwriter is and also who the claims handling company is because that is the phone number you would never in the event of a claim.Again the actual product has no Covid 19 cover but will cover other sections if you travel against FCO advice. As above the main purpose of a policy like this is to insure those that travel to war zones or politically compromised regions.It will be relatively expensive.

"Ann, the quick answer is that if nothing's changed, you either take the policy or don't and accept the risks. After all, that's all insurance is - a measure against risks. There will likely be nothing practically stopping you going to Dubai, that is, should the protocols still be as they currently are, then you simply accept the financial risk of medical expenses due to COVID, testing, quarantine etc IF you don't have medical insurance/Theoretically, you can insure against anything but it will cost you, and it still may not stop it happening.It all comes down to what your priority is - if it's just to see a friend, then it's nothing that can't be rescheduled if you've any reservations about travel. It could be that it could cost you more in time, money, stress et.c trying to find cover (and in checking/worrying that it's in place and nothing will happen) than simply than it is to change your plans (or ask your friend to come to you!)"
"Hi all I arrived Dubai from the UK yesterday - have a Cigna International Health insurance policy which covers Covid - it’s punchy in terms of price (£140 per month) but is valid worldwide. I’d certainly recommend it for those that may need to travel and are struggling with the travel insurance route. Flew with emirates - brilliant flight, the staff were amazing and everyone was very diligent and safe. Arrived at Dubai airport and immigration was certainly different to how it’s been in the past, but was smooth and I was through with my bags in about 45 minutes. Very grateful to finally be here and would be more than happy to answer any questions for those that have been in the same boat."
"Definitely “punchy” at £1,680 annually when compared to a standard annual cover at roughly £200 but a solid company with a USA parent and a European headquarters in Brussels.Hope you don’t need to use it but as you say it’s there if people have to travel against FCO advice"
#21 DubaiViennaLondon How did you get on with the covid-19 test? did you take results from a uk test?
"DubaiViennaLondon, what happened (if anything) in regards to having your travel insurance checked when you arrived at DXB? Many thanks."
I took results from a uk test I’d taken a few days before and they didn’t ask to test me on arrival even though I was expecting to need to. The test set up all looked pretty good and people were getting through fast. It was all very efficient.
"Hi Demine i they didn’t actually ask to see my insurance when I got to Dubai - they asked to see it briefly at Heathrow when checking me in. You do have to declare you have it on the form which you give to the authorities on arrival. I know there’s another form they give you if you don’t have health insurance which you sign to say you’ll bear all hospital costs if you were to get sick with Covid whilst in the country, but as some have already highlighted in this thread it wouldn’t be advisable to travel without it...Edited: 3:40 am, July 10, 2020 "
Hello where did you get the test done ? As I can’t find anywhere that will test unless you have symptoms
Can I please ask where you got your PCR test done prior to travelling as I’m due to fly to Dubai from Glasgow next month. How did you get your results and how long did it take to get them. Also did you have to attend a clinic or was it a home test. What was the cost for the test.
"John S: I would wait a week or so and then start looking for answers. Most of the experienced folk on here seem to be suggesting that things will iron themselves out with regards to procedures after they have been up and running for a while. The initial data is probably not worth looking at if you are travelling in August.At the moment, lots of people just seem to be looking for someone to tell them its OK to go to Dubai with no active insurance...In the meantime, keep checking the FCO website...Edited: 9:42 am, July 11, 2020 "
And this one: https://mediaoffice.ae/en/news/2020/June/21-…Seems to be that you either get tested in you own country before travel or on arrival in Dubai. Seems like its all nice and easy (guessing no follow up checks etc) BUT the insurance is the big issue in my opinion. I wouldn't travel to the UAE/USA with no proper coverage - even if Covid-19 wasn't an issue. A slip by the pool could make it a very expensive break in the sun...
Hays travel today announced (not looked at the small print) any bookings taking now with them their insurance covers covid.
Presumably FCO also has to say OK to travel and not just essential trips. Saying you are covered and making a claim and getting paid out are often a fair distance apart
Does anyone think the FCO will change their advice by August ?
"I think it will if everything stays as it is currently. I think there is a lot of ifs and buts and my personal view on the handling of this is possibly best to kept to myself but its probably the intern that hasn't updated the website yet.UAE seems to be open, they have a testing procedure if you arrive in the country without a test in the previous 96 hours (from what I have read on the govts site) so should be good to go. Again, if there is no OK from the FCO I wouldn't travel based on insurance alone. Forget Covid-19 - lots of stuff could happen - lost luggage, injury or other illness. Wouldn't like to pay a hospital stay of 2 nights with a CT scan out of my own pocket if insurance backed the claim down.Edited: 11:14 am, July 11, 2020 "
Im just worried as the UAE wasn’t on the first list. This was a very strange decision but only time will tell.
"Regarding FCO advice, bear in mind that it is not purely health-related measures that determine the advice.It not be politically judicious for the UK Gov to approve travel to a country that has such an eccentric and unreliable system of approvals that has effectively stranded thousands of its citizens that are resident in UAE and left them unable to return or leave."
"@ John - if it's any help, there are a few factors to consider with the insurance and the FCO advice is just one of them. Do be sure to check the depths of 'COVID cover' (which is already a 'smoke and mirrors' marketing ploy for some sellers) and that it covers things like - travelling against FCO advice, travel curtailments, on-cost, medical expenses etc.Most of all, do have the means to pay for treatment at the point of service as some policies may stipulate the need to pay then reclaim rather than have all the charges approved in advance.Sorry to sound negative but it's better to 'prepare for the worst'."
"Hi @DubaiViennaLondonI have had a look on the website of this travel insurance. Does it definitely cover for coronavirus related risks despite the FCO advice against travel?Did you have to call someone and ask about/ have the policy tailored? I am looking to travel to Kenya now that they are looking to reopening their borders, however I am struggling to find any travel insurance, which was the same position as you. Any help/advice on how to find a policy would be great. I hope you enjoy your trip. ThanksGeorgie"
"Hays Travel who are a U.K. based firm are offering travel insurance which specifically covers pandemics and includes Covid both in respect of medical insurance and cancellation or curtailment due to the pandemic. It also includes cruises whereby you can claim monies back should you be confined to your cabin due to an outbreak. They launched it on 10th July and it’s underwritten by Allianz. I am unsure if it only applies to holidays booked through them but for any future bookings it may be worth a look.I haven’t looked at the finer details but I suspect it’s also subject to FCO adviceEdited: 2:04 am, July 13, 2020 "
I can’t see where to book it? Is it only for Hays customers who have booked a trip through them?
Untill fco changes. Insurance is invalid. So I don't understand why they are looking at invalid Insurance policies. Read any Insurance and its all invalid if you travel against advice. Even Insurance that specialises in travel against advice are not doing it because of covid. So any talk of Insurance is pointless untill fco advice changes. Or just sign the form to bare costs.
"@ Kev - Thats is not true at all. There are many places you can get travel insurance even with FCO advice in place.Campbell Irvine is one example i know of, as an employee of mine just used them to fly home to see an ill relative. I don't know the exact cost, but i was informed it wasn't much more than his normal insurance."
"Hi, I am due to travel to Dubai to teach on August 10th. Medical health insurance will be provided by my school, but they have asked all new teachers to get cover for 3 months while this is being set up. I have had emails from Aetna and Afia, who both say that they don't provide it for 3 months. My husband will be coming with me and I will be sponsoring him and so will need medical health insurance for him as well. I have travel insurance through my bank currently, so only need health insurance as we will be living there, but I am unsure what to do if they don't provide 3 month cover. Does anyone have any advice as to what to do in this situation?"
"Its very true. Go onto their website and look at question 1 of faq,s....no cover if you travel anywhere against fco advice haha people are crazy"
So it would be 250 pounds. First thing ot tells you is not valid if you travel against advice
"A number of U.K. travel insurance companies, like Avanti and Staysure, are offering policies which cover Covid related risks, for destinations that are amongst the “ travel corridors” countries on the FCO website....https:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors"
What use is that. Uae not on the list
"#51It isn’t at the moment, but the FCO are said to be reviewing the air corridors destinations towards the end of this week or early next week, and as soon as the advice changes, we’ll be back to Dubai like a shot."
fingers crossed. I'm going anyway. Sign the forms to bare costs. I'm in more danger going to a tesco in the UK than I am dubai lol
"@ Rebecca, even outside of the current health & economical climate, I would be very wary of funding anything for a sponsor's benefit out of my own pocket. You set a risky precedent at that rate as they may forever put off either recompensating you or providing their own cover. If it's in the contract and package to provide medical cover, that's for them to sort out so let them deal with it. If they start quibbling I'd be either reconsidering pr perhaps contacting/researching via Keren Bobker (The National (or FinancialUAE on Tw) for advice.Now is not the time to be taking financial risks in the current UAE economical climate, and schools are particularly in the firing line for cutbacks/closures so it *may* be a cost-cutting exercise.If this is an issue, drop me a DM with a few more details and I can speak with some of my teacher network to see if it's 'normal' or what they'd recommend. For me, the alarm bells ring with things like that but it may be perfectly above board."
"@ Kev W - That is for the standard policy, they provide other policies...""Please contact Campbell Irvine if you are aware of any part of your journey which is likely to be in a country or region against British FCO as would be delighted to discuss the most appropriate type of cover.Campbell Irvine also offers more specialist policies to areas against FCO advice. Please click here to download an application form which you should complete and email to us with details of your itinerary. Alternatively, to enquire about arranging cover, please contact us for details of the information we will require to obtain a quotation."""
"Again and for clarity.Neither Avanti, StaySure or Campbell Irvine are insurance companies - they are all agents. If you want to know who the insurance company (underwriter) and claims management companies are is behind the brand name then it can be found on all their web pages. All agents are required to provide that information to you before you buy from them."
"Latimer,The companies mentioned are Brokers or MGA’s... Managing General Agents.. All of whom are regulated and authorised to trade in the U.K. in the business of selling travel insurance policies , by the FCA.I don’t believe anyone suggested they are actual “ insurance companies” or direct Underwriters..RegardsEdited: 1:17 pm, July 15, 2020 "
Just purchase a travel insurance
"If you've been seek with Covid and tested positive you'll be tested positive for another 3-4 months no matter what , so dont rely on it/"
"@Rebecca - this advise seems a little shonky to me: when I moved to Dubai, the company I was working for had health insurance set up from when I stepped off the plane. Also check that your bank travel insurance covers you for a long stay - most don’t go past 30 days away from the UK. Also check that it includes travel where FCO say ‘no go’."
Was you able to find an insurance company which will cover you even when you travel against FCO advise?
"WotsitAt the risk of being labelled pedantic, I quote from your reply at 50“A number of travel insurance companies, like StaySure and Avanti”When you say “you don’t think anyone suggested they were insurance companies” it was actually you that did but I’m pleased you’ve now acknowledged you were incorrect.I’m well aware of their status and the fact that they are regulated to sell insurance (however not regulated as insurers) as I’ve already pointed that out on this topicEdited: 5:52 pm, July 23, 2020 "
Ive stumbled across travel insurance from https://www.battleface.com. They are covering areas which FCO are adivisng against. Cover for covid is medical expenses only though.
I want to travel to Dubai to see family who I miss desperately. Emirates will cover me for Covid 19 insurance and travel disruption . I am not worried about losing luggage but need travel insurance for accident or illness unrelated to Covid is there anywhere I can get this in London ? Thanks for any help
"@ 470christine - there are a few links to companies in the thread, and also another thread I posted yesterday. https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g295…Personally, I wouldn't be reliant on the Emirates policy."
