"Hi, visiting in October (hopefully!) anyone know if cash is still roundly accepted in Krakow? Don’t want to change loads of money over to then not be able to use it anywhere..."
Cash was widely accepted last week.
"Of course it's widely accepted, and has been widely accepted all through this corona epidemic."
Thanks sorry I know it sounds a daft question but in the uk a lot of places will now only allow card payments
"There are some cafes in Poland that only accept cards but they have been doing that for a few years now because that's convenient for them, nothing to do with covid. Not sure if there are any of those in Kraków, I only know some in Warsaw."
