I expect more areas having extra restrictions soon if this news story is true....https:/…1947333Steve
"They are indeed in a deepening crisis tebo and have been for weeks/months.No doubt the forum ""medical experts"" will be on shortly to tell us its only a bit of flu bruv.Atb steve"
"Yes the cases per day have been very high ranging from 2,000 to 6,000 over the last few weeks.While there have been 114,857 cases over the last two months from June 19th to present that is 1,883 per day the deaths equate to 485 with nearly half of them coming over 2 days an average of 8 per day in total.So 0.04 deaths of the population in the last two months compared to 7.5% in the earlier months.It was not uncommon for Spain to have 800 deaths a day in April so an average of 8 is very low.Would not surprise me if the only two significant daily deaths of 127 and 73 were a result of a catch up in the stats. I would expect todays figures to be back to the normal levels.Edited: 7:18 am, August 20, 2020 "
For population that was meant to be confirmed cases sorry.
"They have more cases because they test more, and a big % are false positives. Mortality is mainly old people as sadly it's getting into care homes again (they haven't really done anything to solve this problem, so not surprising that it's happening again...). For me those figures mean nothing (they never did, on any country), I just pay attention at hospitals and these are perfectly fine."
"They test more? Is that fact estafania.Atb steveEdited: 7:43 am, August 20, 2020 "
If we tested properly then Cornwall would’ve been locked down weeks ago
Yes sorry I have the article where I read it a couple of days ago with facts & figures but it's in spanish (https:/…)
"#1 afternoon steve not sure the CMO posts on TA, however, what was it he said about covid and flu?"
Spain has tested over 50k less per 1 million of population than the UK.
"Hospitalisations are also on the rise, as would be expected. Headed inexorably to more stringent measures in early Sept, to bring the numbers back under control. I doubt these will be localised."
Pray tell jamie☺.Atb steve

"There’s a virus out there which is deadly to a tiny amount of the population, and there’s no cure.We’ve either all had it, or we’re all gonna get it.It’s just the flu..... only not as deadly.CheersDavy !!!"
"Hello jamie, i am sure he takes the current situation quite seriously though.Shame chris whitty does not post on here he could clear up some of the key arguments.Probably not much good with the cheapest pint or best full english though.Atb steve"
"Toon_fan_1, wrong. It's estimated between 40-80% of the population won't get it as they are protected against it."

Spot on Mitch
"When the true figures come out ..... although I’m not totally convinced that they will.... the likes of Piers Morgan and the rest of the w@&#%€$ in our media will be nowhere to be seen. They have scared the living daylights out of people because of this Chinese flu that is harmless to over 99% of the population.Factor in those who have been so traumatised by them that they sadly took their own lives.... plus the thousands upon thousands who have died coz the hospitals and doctors are effectively shut (with nobody in them) and the true cost of this media led frenzy will be laid bare. You’ll see next year that deaths from emphysema, bronchitis, heart disease etc, etc, etc are all massively down.... coz everyone died from Covid.You don’t need to be a conspiracy theorist to do basic maths!!!A virus so deadly, that over 99% of the population needs a test to tell whether they’ve got it.Wake up!"
Seems most of the population can't do the basic maths :)Let's hope the truth comes out eventually
"Have a look at this spanish tv interview with a doctor on the front lines of this virus outbreak, full subtitles in English, it's not as bad as the media are making out, a very funny video, and puts everything into perspective about the totally mad situation we are in.https://www.youtube.com/watch…I feel very sorry for all the entertainers and businesses in Benidorm going bust, locking down for what now seems to be a very minor illness."
And as for “scientific data”..... not a single person on this forum is wearing a face nappy because of it...... they’re doing so because a stranger on the television told them to.
I’ve never seen electrons but some bloke that I don’t know told a man that taught me about them - I’ve made the mistake of telling people about them. Silly fake electrons. I actually had an atom that told me that it was positive that it had lost an electron.
I remember when I was told .... by lots of experts.....that Saddam Hussain had weapons of mass destruction that he could launch on us in 45 minutes.I also remember watching 2 million people die and Europe being swamped by the resulting “refugees”Experts eh?
"#25 thanks for sharing, unfortunately many are and will remain , scared s******s."
The experts repeatedly said he didn’t. A small group of self-interested politicians said he did. This time the experts are sounding the alarm and the politicians are largely in agreement but for how to actually balance of the various issues - which are unfortunately and inevitably (seemingly) caught up in the self-interest of a small group of politicians.
Covid is terribleMan flu is a killer.
You’re right: what is the WHO doing about man flu? I’m outraged.
Portugal been given the green light to travel. so there is hope if spain can control these cases that it will be possible to travel before to long.
"It would be very interesting to know how many experts on here either work on the front line dealing with the virus, have had the virus themselves or have had a relative hospitalised with it. Ignorance exists when you have an opinion about something you know nothing about."
"Have we had the ....”would you say that to the relative of someone who died from Covid” comment yet?That’s always a favourite of the virtuous!I remember when doctors advertised the health benefits of smoking, coz they got paid a shed loads of money to do so.... and still would if they hadn’t been called out!I remember a wonderful new drug called thalidomide.That went well.It’s almost as if challenging medical opinion isn’t such a bad thing!Edited: 5:53 am, August 21, 2020 "
The figures just came out for Spain today 16 deaths so not great but hardly cause to shut the country down.If we do not open the world up we will be shut down forever. New Zealand getting four cases than locking down will mean no one will ever be able to visit there again as will go on for 100 years.
awful when you consider they don't count care homes or cases were death is suspected but not confirmed. likely a hell of a lot more
Spain's loss will now be Portugal's gain. Calder just saying flight bookings surged 500% in 2 hours with prices quadrupling in that time (albeit from a very low start). Only problem is a 100s % rise in tourists will drive up infections and so the cycle will continue with the resultant measures reimposed. Can't go on like this needs a different strategy.
"@33 Interesting time, what are the Spanish hoteliers going to think watching all the cash flow West on the same peninsula?I saw this today, a great train crash of an intreview with a Spanish Doctor & two media types who are clearly inhabiting the same fear crazed planet as the public. The Doctor is having none of it!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glh21Vk7SosEdited: 3:46 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"Just nip on to the Croatia forums, it's almost en masse people booking Portugal tonight as they are having their Croatian plans scuppered. It's getting seriously silly this now."
"Portugal should never of had a blanket ban on travel, some areas have been lucky to have very few cases. They dont blanket ban the UK when certain areas have souring infection rates."
A colleague who is Croatian texted me earlier. She was due to fly home for a couple weeks..she's livid!Margaurite
"#34 yes have 93 yr old mother in law who has beaten the virus twice!!!posted about it before,have personally at the request of the hopsital visited to take home her dirty covid infected washing!, thought not allowed in hospitals??. So pretty much first hand info. For front line opinions and facts maybe check out Bobby c posts.I dont think posters purport to be experts, they just interpret facts differently and just because some have different opinions doesnt necessarily mean they are wrong."
"I watch an Americans travel vlog. He goes every where ,and posted some in Croatia this week. Can't remember exactly where but old walls,little streets etc. Very busy and no one at all wearing masks. Now I have my own vews on masks and effectiveness of them but if it's law you have to wear them. By watching his vids you could tell was only matter of time it be on list.Edited: 3:16 am, August 21, 2020 "
"To get things into perspective the U.K had 2 deaths yesterday, Germany 1 Italy 9 and France 23. Spain not out yet. To cripple the world for so few deaths when more people will have been knocked down by a bus or a car is crazy. The Governments have got this badly wrong."
"I can go do a job of work up north,come back not have to quarantine,but most places abroad I have too. Some places up north if media believed it's rampant."
Aye lad it's rampant up 'ere. There's a lot of people further north than us though.
"Spain's results just in and out of a population of £334m for the U.K. Italy, France Germany and Spain we had a total of 60 deaths out of five countries. Yes very bad but destroying the economy for ever more seems a bit harsh with such low numbers. The governments need to wake up to the fact it's not the number of cases but the number of deaths that count."
"Could it be that the numbers are low because of all the precautions that are in place? Maybe without those precautions, which some posters think are un-necessary and pointless the death rate might be far, far higher!Steve"
"Tebo what happened in April was very alarming with round 8.0% of people with the virus dying very worrying to say the least. So out of 100,000 people up to 8,000 would die. The whole world and borders needed locking down and huge mistakes were made not least the borders. However now in August out of every 100,000 people who have the virus only 400 are dying so a massive difference at a time when most of the restrictions have been lifted. So either the virus has significantly weakened or people are more resilient.The fact that hardly anyone is in hospital despite a large number of cases tells the story."
The people being admitted to hospital does not seem to reflect the rising number of cases that seem to be soaring in my area alone.Dawn x
There's always a lag in deaths as many people who died spent over month or two on ventilators first.re portugal - Portugal cases have doubled in the last 5 days - i expect it wont be on green list for long as its already at 14/100000
"Yes Dawn in my wider area which has a population of 800,000 only 3 people were in hospital one serious where s in April they had to build an extra hospital not that it was ever used.Do not get me wrong April was very bad but now things are as good as it can get.Edited: 4:12 pm, August 21, 2020 "
"I agree, cases are up but hospital admission has been low. Perhaps people are getting immunity to it."
"Does it matter what the local situtation is in areas of the the uk are in relation to quarantine restrictions introduced to other countries such as spain? When we have the sort of statistics that spain currently have they will impose restrictions on us no worries about that.Somehow many seem to think that its the situation in the uk that is the reason for measures, it spains situation thats the cause of concern, as the title of the post suggests.Surely?"
"Simon said in July ""Sad to say a massive 2615 cases reported in Spain today so the government are not going to tolerate those levels that is for sure""Today over 3650 cases and a total change of direction. Stay safe everyone. We all miss our trips abroad but sometimes we need to look at the bigger picture."
I don’t get the Spanish figures Worldometer reckrds today’s figures as in their 3000s yet Catalan news today reported over 8000!
"The Ministry of Health has reported 3,650 new cases, 1,200 of those in Madrid and 25 deaths in Spain on Friday"
"Uh-oh, the same news report went on to say "" The report has also updated the number of positives, incorporating 8,148 new diagnoses compared to Thursday,"" so I can understand Sunshinevinos' confusion."
"The virus doesn't know where it is:-) Spains graphs mirror the UK's & elsewhere increased testing = increased cases of prefectly healthy people, we can do this forever and ever. But like the Madrid Doc said in the vid, the nmedia has it wrong and his hospital is prettty much empty."
"MitchCornwall - yep double standards. UK Govt having national quarantines for arrivals from abroad but local lockdowns for UKSimon - you're right. Shutting down society on basis of tiny number of deaths is an over-reaction. NZ having lockdown in Aukland for 4 cases is pathetic.Robert H - it's not just covid but other health conditions, the economy and social and mental wellbeing."
"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Friday compared New Zealand's case numbers to the United States to highlight how well her country had managed cases.“New Zealand is among a small number of countries that still has a low rate of COVID-19 cases and one of the lowest death rates in the world,” she said.“For example, the United States has 16,563 cases per million people. We have 269 cases per million people. Today in New Zealand we're talking 11 cases whereas the United States is dealing with over 40,000 cases.Lack of effective lockdown and protective measures sees the US with 5.6 million cases and 175,695 deaths.Meanwhile in Spain, in the last 24 hours, 765 people have been hospitalised for Covid-19, while another 25 deaths were confirmed. The Spanish Ministry of Health reported 8,148 new cases on Friday.Not hard to see why these restrictions are in place and good, responsible control doesn’t look pathetic to me.Jules"
"Here is latest covid death chart. 16 deaths in Spain the last full day reporting. Spain and UK have similar overall death rates. Tragic as they are, still only a tiny percentage of the population. Vast majority are elderly and many could have been avoidable eg UK care homes.We are now in situation of local lockdowns or quarantine on basis of 0.1% of population or less catching covid. In NZ, shutting down a city on basis of 4 deaths is way to disproportionate.Covid is not the be all and end all. Other factors - economy, health (non covid), social and mental wellbeing.It is selfish to focus in covid"
"Sorry, Spain reported 127 deaths in one day a few days ago, with 542 critically ill and in a very poorly state of health. Hospitals are seeing a very big increase in admissions as the ""R"" multiplies or spirals again.Last figure on one chart for yesterday sadly, showed 41 had past away. Do we really want to see this same situation starting or happening all over again here in the UK. Nothing against people going on holiday, yes go for it and enjoy your holiday in Spain. Is a holiday in a country with spiralling infection rates really what you want. If the answer is Yes, well go on and book it now. Then please do the right thing and Quarantine, until you are proved to be free of all covid19 infection.We have done well in the UK and are keeping rates manageable and low, getting back to normal. Keeping those travelling from places with high infection rates away or asking them to as least quarantine."
"Jeny - Holidays in Spain or anywhere this year are just not realistic. Even if the quarantine in UK was lifted, the actual holiday would mean wearing masks, social distancing and pretty dead nightlife.Let's hope next year is better."
"#50 afternoon steve, not sure your analogy that the precautions we are undertaking are the reasons the numbers are low? I thought infections were on the increase and actually more people now infected than in the peak?, so does that actually mean the precautions are indeed not working?. Hospitalizations and deaths I totally agree are very low, obviously to be hospitalized and sadly die from this virus you first must be infected, which apparently hundreds of thousands are. Keep the forum updated on the protest along the prom today.CheersJamie"
"Johnny b. Unrealistic for some, not for others. We had a good time but we don’t really bother with clubs and cabaret. The masks can be a pain but as soon as you sit you can take them off, not needed to be worn on the beach or by the pool. It won’t be ideal for a lot of people, agreed, but we had a great time. Cheers."
"It's flippin hard to lead a horse to water.......Strip away the hysteria and take out your calculator, then the NHS stats. I am 57 and IF I managed to catch it then I'd have a 99.95+% chance of being totally fine. My mum is mid-80's, fit & healthy, unfortunately, her chances drop to 99%+.No harsh lockdowns work, it's proven. Sweden is ahead, Peru with the harshest is struggling. NZ is bonkers, you cannot hide from a virus, what are they going to do, go to bed & isolate themselves from the world forever?It's pleasing to see more ""sensible"" views becoming mainstream this week. It's a nasty virus, but it's already taken out the most vulnerable now we have to live with it, another nasty flu, not a new bubonic plague.Edited: 11:11 am, August 23, 2020 "
"It’s perhaps just ‘a nasty flu’ to you based on that percentage calculation Bobby but the most vulnerable 2.2 million have been shielding till lately, me included. A significant number are children and young people. I’m afraid it hasn’t taken out all of the most vulnerable by now. I know my chance of surviving it from my specialist and stats and frankly it isn’t good (and I’m not elderly). People like me just ask the more complacent to be aware and considerate. Yes we may have to live with it but let’s do it with greater awareness of others. Rules have to be imposed and enforced for those who think they’re invincible or just couldn’t give a dam!NZ has an excellent, aggressive track and trace system. They only shut down for a short time to allow the infected people and their contacts to be traced. It works if it’s done properly. It worked brilliantly in a town near me recently and avoided a major shutdown. Jules"
"Heard a doctor on the morning news say a vaccine is at least16 months away. No doubt after getting one, you'd have to show proof before travelling over seas. The denser the population the more infections, which speaks for itself. As for N.Z, there are more people living in London."
"Unlikely you will have to show proof, they will be years before enough vaccine is manufactured to supply the whole world.I'll not be having it anyway, the flu jab made me ill."

"Only 15 deaths yesterday between the U.K., France, Germany and Italy. In Sweden next to no one dying at all with a handful reported every day which you can count on one hand. Yet we are shutting down the whole world. Sweden had beaten the virus by staying open. The likes of New Zealand will be in lockdown for years to come the way they are carrying on. Great article in the Daily Mail this weekend on how Sweden got it right and the rest of us wrong. Now they can get on with their lives while the rest of us continue to hide foe ever more."
"Jenny the 127 deaths reported in one day was not a true figure as it represented a back log of cases. Spains average over the last two months is 8 a day . The last 3 days has seen 15, 25 and zero deaths so yes a slight increase but nothing to shut the country down."
I got my figures from the Spanish Ministry of Health Simon. They tend to be more reliable than second hand information from the Daily Mail.I think we have to respect how the host country decides to protect its population too. We are only visitors there.Jules
"The spanish national and local legistlators will indeed decide what measures are needed moving forward in spain, not those hoping to visit.Just like the uk govt will decide on whether quarantine and advice with respect to spain will still be in place.At a reported infection rate of 145/100,000 nationally in spain does anyone seen those restrictions changing anytime soon?Atb steve"
"At some stage there is liable to be anarchy.Is 145/100,000 really so bad?If I wear a mask and distance, it shouldn't matter to me if the countries figure is that, or even double that.Apart from the Airport/plane problem of course."
"Whether its good/ bad is subjective mally, but infection rates are important determinates for govt policy regards measures not just the uk but other countries too.For comparison the uk is around 21/100,000 nationally and most seem to think its awful as is the response.Spain was in the high 20's when measures were introduced so they are not getting better.None of us make the ""rules"" some see the validity of them some dont.Its still possible to travel for those that really want to.Atb steve"
"Short memory some have Simon. Are we talking about the Same Spain that was so quick to give all holidaymakers their marching orders. Caused untold distruption for so many British. Do you honestly think that Spain does not have a real problem with covid19 infections at this moment.Tell it to the Government of Spain, because they are the ones imposing all of these new restrictions upon Spain. Maybe they should have asked you first. The UK Gov or any other countries do not make the decisions in Spain. They have done this all on their own, based on their own figures and knowledge.We in the UK certainly do Not want to go back to the time when we had such high death rates.Anyone wishing to travel to Spain, can get on a plane and go there. Because Spain has such high infection rates, people returning from Spain are asked to Quarantine.If the UK had rates as high as Spain, no country would allow Those travelling from the UK to enter. That is the way things are at the moment. Things might change one day if Spain can get its rates under control. Sorry at the moment Spains figures are spiralling upwards. Their death rate is increasing, their admissions to hospital are increasing, their patients who are critically ill and needing intensive care increasing."
"Sadly true Jeny because on Friday, 765 people were hospitalised for Covid-19 in Spain while another 25 deaths were confirmed. The Spanish Ministry of Health reported 8,148 new cases on Friday. They must be thinking, ‘not again!’As Steve has said, the Spanish Govt have to think about their health service and how many from the 8,148 will need hospitalisation. How many did those people infect? The problem with Covid is its transmissibility and though many don’t suffer badly, they’re still able to pass it around especially to visitors who then take it back home. It all begins again. Just hope the U.K. can hold steady. I do agree another full lockdown would be catastrophic.Jules"
"#80You make many excellent points about traveling at the moment. Sadly as has been the case for months, spending a week in Spain and returning with all the implications for wider society, is beyond the moral thought processes of many."

"My home town of Burton on Trent is being monitored as there have been 25 infections in the last week. As the population is around 65,000 that takes us over the magical figure of 20 infections per 100,000. Absolute over reaction. Most of the cases are in the Asian community and until they are forced to comply with the rules the virus will never be controlled. I know people will say I'm being racist but you've only got to look at places in the UK where there have been/are local lockdowns and there is a common theme. Just saying it how it is and as the old adage goes 'truth hurts'"
"Why was it an absolute over reaction Colin? Did they lockdown the town or just try to address the localised spike?If they hit it quickly and aggressively, it can stop those 25 cases quickly becoming 2,500 and on and on. Worked here whereas some towns and cities ended up back on lockdown because the response from the authorities wasn’t as pro-active.Jules"
"Jules, if you'd read my post properly I said we were being monitored not in lock down yet. As I stated locking down the pubs etc would be useless as they are not frequented by the Asians who account for the vast majority of the new infections. Unless their community is forced to adhere to the rules like the rest of the population we will get nowhere. It is only in the last month or so the Asian shops have been displaying any sort of social distancing notices. There are now signs in the streets which largely consist of Asians that emphasise the need for such measures. Sadly they are being largely ignored."
"I did read your post properly Colin and wasn’t being critical, I genuinely was interested in what you thought the ‘absolute over reaction’ was which implied something restrictive had been done.It is clear that there are areas where cultural issues impact on compliance. We’ve had spikes in areas where large extended families live together and multi occupancy areas where social distancing is more of an issue.Jules"
"Jules go on the Corona Virus Worldometer the true site. Spain has had next to no deaths in the last two months except for 2 days which is a catch up of figures. Eight deaths a day does not warrant shutting the country down forever.Edited: 5:59 pm, August 23, 2020 "
"I do look at that site Simon and even if it is a catch up, the concern is the escalating numbers of new cases. Jules"

"Ideally the percentage figure should be taken over the last 2 or 3 weeks. Because it is now, today, yesterday, presently, last week, that the figures are escalating very quickly.No good taking a percentage spread over 2 months because they will be lower. Creative accounting maybe.Spain had managed to get its house in order during that period, so percentage figures will obviously work out more favorable. Spain has not produced any updates figures for the weekend on the site you mention Simon.Presumably there is someone knowledgeable in the Spanish Government who knows the true figures. Do you think that they Spain brought in these strict restrictions just for the sake of it. Do you honestly think they would deprive businesses of an income for nothing.Ask all the other countries why they have put restrictions on their citizens travelling to Spain. Can't all be wrong.There are warnings that their intensive care in some hospitals are under great strain again."
"Jules - those figures Simon gave are correct and the Spanish health ministry are indeed catch up.Do you mean Asian when you talk of multi generational householdsJeny5 - some stats for you over 14 day period.SpainCases 152 per 100,000Deaths 0.7 per 100,000Let's not exaggerate the problemhttps:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
"Just been watching a Professor on Good Morning Britain. Have to say he made complete sense (almost ass much as Johnny B). Core of his message was that people are panicking too much because of all the scaremongering. He said we've all got to keep our guard up over the coming months and strictly observe the social distancing rules. If this is done the virus can be contained. No need to shut down society as lots of people suggest as he said risk of catching virus is low. It's up to each and everyone of us to be careful both to protect ourselves and, in particular, the most vulnerable."
"Makes perfect sense to me, but the reality is that in Spain the number of cases is growing every day (from hundreds to thousands a day in a few weeks). It's not a problem if hospitals can handle it, but sadly the number of people admitted to hospital is also growing , and so is the people dying (probably most elderly). I think another lockdown would be terrible for the economy, but as things are today I don't 100% discard it and I'm already thinking of alternatives to my holiday in 2 weeks."
"I hate to say this, but spain will be returning to lockdown again unless there is a real change in infections. The previous lockdown was harsh, and the restrictions introduced since coming out of lockdown obviously have not worked for Spain. Something drastic has happened to make the cases increase so much. Perhaps they needed longer before opening up."
"There have been new restrictions put in place in Murcia and Cataluña to limit gathering of only 6 people if you dont all live in the same house. Hopefully we will see a drop in the infection rate in the next few weeks once all the Spanish return to the cities from having their summer holidays down here on the coast.I do believe that after the harsh lockdown they opened the boarders on the different provences too soon, it hasn't been tourist from europe that has made the figure rise but the opening of discos and people not social distancing and intermingling during the summer holiday."
"Another lockdown won't solve anything, same would happen when it's lifted.. and the economy cannot take it."
"It seemd unlikely the present govt in spain would ever get enough support in congress for another state of alarm and national lockdown.Though there are many local areas and regions that probably require such action already, with madrid becoming one of the new epicentres and asking several areas around madrid to voluntarily stay home.Atb steveEdited: 12:28 pm, August 24, 2020 "
"Never ending spiral.Lock them up it subsides.Let them out it comes back.Likely to be around much longer than me.Needs a rethink, but too many governments down the same track to change now.Open the world for 3 months. Just maintain distance and masks, by law and with a big stick.Either things won't get much worse.Or they will get a lot worse and people will understand the reasoning better."
Could not agree more Mally. With most countries showing 0.04 per cent deaths now not the 8.00% in April and May now is the time to take the risk. If we keep locking down we will have this for ever. Need to open everything up till December and see how it goes. Should now be based on the death rate not the number of cases as next to no one dying on a daily basis. More chance of getting killed on your bike than dying of the virus so if the government want to keep people safe please ban bikes. U.K. deaths yesterday 4 so that tells a story.
Life without risks is no life at all.
"The results now in and a total of 37 deaths in the U.K.,France, Germany Italy and Spain out of a population of £324 million combined. The world is at standstill and millions losing their jobs and homes. Time to get a grip."
"The world at standstill? Extraordinary situation and not ideal but a standstill, lots are getting on with it everywhere."
"Benisteve, lots are getting on with it, as you put it, only if allowed to by respective countries. There are a hell of a lot of people out there who have been scared stiff by a lot of scaremongering and over hyped misinformation. Will have to see how the schools reopening goes as despite assurances from ALL the medical officers there are still thousands of parents absolutely petrified to send their children back."
"If parents are petrified to send their children back, they need educating to the fact that risk to a child is very remote. I imagine most of the children would tell them that."
"Quite agree RochdaleMally but I know people who are scared to go the pub, shops etc so I can see where they're coming from even though the risk, as you say, is negligible."
"Jules, your ending comment is hardly balanced as you put it. If everyone did show a bit more consideration and took the rules seriously, rather than just the vast majority, the sooner we would get out of this nightmare. It is perfectly possible to have some semblance of normal life without going overboard. I appreciate everyone has got their own level of risk ant to some there is a far greater chance of contracting the virus. My comment was specifically relating to young children who all the so called experts (not those on here) are universally agreed that the risk is very low"
"Amazingly, we don’t disagree on everything Colin and regardless of how we think we should achieve it, we are all desperately wanting the same thing. This subject has polarised people more than any I’ve ever known especially on here. I’m not sure if Benidorm will ever get back to normal but it would be good to see this forum being less of a daily verbal dispute.Jules"
"Hear hear, Jules. I'm sure we all want the same outcome, just got differing views on how to achieve it"
"Latest daily stats for SpainNew cases: 2,000New deaths : 12Yes, there may be an increase in cases - but that doesn't translate to new deathshttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/2…Edited: 7:02 pm, August 24, 2020 "

"Simon""We keep locking down we will have this for ever. Need to open everything up till December and see how it goes. Should now be based on the death rate not the number of cases as next to no one dying on a daily basis""Totally agreeLook at SpainCases 175 per 100kDeaths 0.6 per 100kRochdaleMally - totally agree too. Life without risks is no life.Jules - you may feel you are at a higher risk group. That doesn't mean everybody shoulf face lockdowns, quarantines and the like. Nobody here is dismissing deaths or serious illness from covid. But for the vast majority, the risk is negligibleEdited: 9:56 am, August 25, 2020 "
"Now Johnny, don’t twist my words to insinuate I believe my personal situation should affect how we deal with this pandemic. I’ve never thought or said that. I take personal responsibility for myself which is why so many of us protected ourselves and the NHS at the peak of infection. Just remember that those with ‘negligible’ levels of risk are still carriers and as such remain vectors of disease. Community responsibility is all most people ask for.That is my limit on this subject because inevitably people perceive situations based on their world view and personal needs. However we need to maintain balance and compassion because we have to co-exist in a wider society.Jules"
"sorry couldn't post a link but this is taken from the N332 police page.BREAKING NEWS!!!President Sanchez has just offered to the Autonomous Communities the right to declare State of Alarm to those who ask for it.Sanchez has declared that each autonomous president will be the one that can request a state of alarm in their area or region. The government will put 2000 personnel available if needed to the Communities, from the Armed Forces as trackers.It will be the Valencian Government who will decide how Benidorm moves forward or backwards after this 3 week smoking ban and bars being closed."
"I just posted a message about this as it was happening, not sure what happened to it... good news I think, Comunidad Valenciana has never had a big number of cases so there's a very small risk of lockdown, and he said they are not considering a national one.Edited: 10:55 am, August 25, 2020 "
"Jules while we are indeed in a worrying situation Spain has averaged 9 deaths a day for the last two months.Yet the country is shut down to all intents and purposes. The death rate in the U.K has been lower than normal the last few weeks but the economy has been destroyed. Does not make sense to me. If everyone is panicking now when hardly any deaths wait till December and January when people will be seriously ill with the flu and many other things. People should start building bunkers in their back garden if they panic about what is happening now. We may as kiss goodbye to life if a handful of deaths a day in France, Italy, U.K. Germany and Spain means the lockdown of Europe. In December it will be lights out and hide under the bed."
"#119 I am with you an a great part of this Simon, however, it is important to respect individuals concerns and for some no matter what anyone says or positive facts put forward, will in no way change their rationale and I perfectly understand that.Here in the North west we have a population of 7.3m , 60 hospitals and at present 96 patients who have tested positive for covid, my question is, how much better do things need to get???"
"My question is, where at any time did I suggest another lockdown? I’ve already said on this thread that another lockdown would be catastrophic. Please read the content of my posts Simon and stop making assumptions. It is possible to have a balanced view on this taking into account risk versus societal impact. All I’ve ever advocated is adherence to the restrictions that make us all safe and respect for others to safeguard against kicking off another major spike. It’s all too easy to forget how bad it actually got and I recall you had a lot to say on the subject at the time.However, I think it’s presumptuous to attempt to impose our views and wants on another country like Spain. They have the right to self determination and we have to respect their rules regardless of whether it inconveniences us as visitors.Jules"
"Simon , ""spain is shut down to all intents and purposes""Do you mean the rock and roll house , flamingo oasis and rockafellas ect is shut down currently because large parts of spain are very much not shut down but working within the same parameters as many other countries.No doubt some cities and regions should be shut down given their stats but thats for regional govts to decide.Calle gerona and the rincon is not the whole extent of spain you know.Atb steveEdited: 3:44 pm, August 25, 2020 "
