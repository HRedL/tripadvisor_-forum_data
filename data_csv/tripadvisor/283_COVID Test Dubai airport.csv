"The quick answer is - nobody knows with any certainty at this stage.The challenge is, there's been no official guidance for the tourists protocols (as yet). Whether this is for PR purposes (it could be perceived as alarming or put people off visiting) or just the way things have been handled (contradictions, fast-moving story, poor comms etc.) is uncertain.Caution suggests to expect the same measures as residents that are returning will face, i.e. quarantine in place until results are issued (which could be 24-72 hours).Bear in mind, this is why we have FCO advice until that changes for the UAE (or even Dubai which *may* be viewed slightly differently) you shouldn't be travelling. At this stage, there's been no official indication that you may be allowed to travel by your planned dates, which may make ""what you fancy"" a moot point sadly.It's worth noting that the measures you're likely to be admitted to Dubai/UAE would include having sufficient medical insurance cover, which could possibly be negated should you choose to travel IF FCO advises against non-essential travel or travel to Dubai/UAE."
Thank you for the reply Shaun.I’m sure it will all be much clearer in the next few weeks.Many thanks
We have the same issue as you no clear answers to this question. We also travel on the 13th august to Dubai and trying to navigate a COVID 19 test within 4 days plus a weekend is going to be tuff.
Stay tuned. We will know soon after July 7th.
"If you're arriving very early morning, there may be a chance you'll not be that inconvenienced even if you have to stay in situ until results. Some folk have had their test results back by sunset of the same day, direct to the app."
My son in law arrived back at Dubai airport as a returning resident yesterday at 3am. He had the test and was told to self isolate until he had the results which came back only a few hours later by text.
That’s good to hear - pleased he got home.
"Thanks Latimer, it was a bit of an ordeal but just relieved he eventually got back safe and sound."
Chrissie did your Son have to pay for the test ?Thank you
"He didn't have to pay, but he is a resident. It may be different for tourists."
"Chrissie, I too am pleased your son in law made it home eventually all safe & sound as I know it was troubling you. It’s good news for your daughter also!"
"Thanks Hannah, it is a weight lifted, particularly for my daughter."
"FYIThe test is free for all passengers.Choose the correct line based on if you had a test before departing, or need one in Dubai.The test on arrival is done just after passport control.Be ready for longer delays than usual.There are forms to complete and an app to download.Test results come back within 24hrs."
"Does everyone have to download the app within the family, or just one?"
that quick?
"My friend's husband, a resident, also had the test at the airport and received the result within a few hours. He said except for the now all too common precautions and having to undergo testing, it was relatively a smooth and uneventful process."
"I arrived to uae today and done with COVID test, but I was wondering where I can see the results of my COVID test. Please advice.Thank you"
"@ Vaseem - surely you submitted some details when you registered and completed the forms? Did you download the app? Did you register your contact details? If so, that's how you *should* get the results.What did they say when you asked them whilst having the test done?"
Did they let you leave the airport without the test result?
"That’s great news if tests are free, however can anybody recommend insurance that would cover any unimaginable case ie get to Dubai do a Covid test to then find out we need to quarantine for 14 days?where is this hotel at the other side if so, and I would imagine it costing a few quid as well as new flights?Go in 15 days Emirates still stand, flights from Glasgow & no issue up until now with W hotel."
"RydoIf you are flying Emirates, you should read the info in this link.... it’s good news !https:/…"
"I know Emirates are ‘shifting sands’ in terms of comms in recent days, but when they announced the insurance ‘offer’ it has exclusions such as ...."" :• your travel against your home country’s government advice or against local authority advice at your trip destination""So, no FCO advice change - no cover fromEmirates/AXA."
"Shaun CCan you point me to the exclusion you have mentioned, because I can’t see it in the link I posted ?Cheers"
"Rydo -I have found an insurance company called 'battleface', they state they cover COVID-19 medical expenses and also cover if you travel against FCO advice."
"@Wotsit, click on to T&Cs on the link and it's under exclusions."
"Chrissie.. thanks for that, I hadn’t scrolled down far enough!Shaun C.. my apologies,Regards to all"
"This is the link to the pdf, and the Exclusion line is midway up Page 4https://c.ekstatic.net/ecl/documents/covid-1…Screenshot > https://d.pr/i/M8wEWO"
"C'Mon Wotsit, admit it ... you just had a ""man look"" didn't you? No worries, no need to apologise at all.I just worry that folk won't 'join the dots' in all of this and will be blagged by sources saying what they want to hear - e.g. ""free insurance"" 'covid cover' 'Dubai is open' etc. rather than checking for themselves.P.S. Been hearing some pretty grim 'word on the street' type stuff today about some of the things that may happen in Dubai/UAE in terms of flights, processes and suchlike os it's VITAL that everyone reads up and understands exactly what's going on for themselves - don't rely on TA , forums, social media etc.You need to know what you've booked, what your rights are and what the implications are."
"I also was looking at battleface, the Covid cover is only medical bills (basically medical cover). There is no cover if UAE lockdown and you can’t get home. Which is risky in my opinion...Edited: 4:33 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Even having a medical cover policy and even with a miracle policy that may somehow not be negated by the FCO non-essential travel advice may not solve all the issues.Medical provision is excellent in Dubai for one reason - it's a massive moneyspinner, and they upsell you better than McDonald's. On top of this, most insurance companies try to avoid pre authorising charging upfront, so unless you have premium cover, you're likely to have to provide funding to get treatment (often a credit card).Even then, you're not out of the woods (so to speak). Depending on several factors, if your bill is not cleared before leaving or there are any other charges, you may not be allowed to leave until settled.This is why the FCO advice and insurance cover for ALL risks (not just medical cover, but on-costs, expenses, curtailment etc.) are so very, very important folks."
"I am looking for similar information on this especially now with the several test scenario we are all facing , we fly start of sempre her so clarity would be of great help, we are aware now that the Emirates will cover the covid side of insurance but has anyone managed to get travel insurance for everything else as our current policy will be null n good unless the FCO changes it’s policy for non essential travel"
"@ Chris - not a lot is 'clear' to speak.Emirates won't necessarily cover the COVID side of insurance. They will give you a free policy, but it *may* be negated by FCO cover OR they may change their terms/conditions ago (as they did yesterday). Yes, currently it seems to be suggesting they will cover for Brits is FCO is still against non-essential travel, but could you rely on them not to change it again?There is a thread about insurance, it may be one or two pages back in the Dubai Forum though."
"You can't get tested at the airport anymore, you have to arrive at the airport in the UK with a negative test before they allow you on the plane."
I have read from an article that those who are coming from Emirates Airline might have to take another covid-19 test on arrival - is this true? Anyone face this situation (Do take into account that you're coming from a country that is not listed for double-testing and you've already got a negative covid test before boarding as of 1 Aug)Here's the article: https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/dubai/now-f…
"What about if it’s just a connected flight , not entering into Dubai?"
"@ Fahad - please read back, the answers are all in the thread linked below (which is the more active & current one)https:/…107465285Edited: 4:07 am, August 02, 2020 "
"@ Chantal - the latest update was to ensure PCR test negative pre-boarding.Certain countries may need to be tested twice, ie on arrival at the destination airport (ie DXB) if they're from specific countries (usually listed by Emirates/carrier) or show symptoms.Edited: 4:09 am, August 02, 2020 "
"Covid test I was in Dubai two weeks ago took my test with NHS just book on GOV really easy the hard thing is coming out of Dubai you won’t be allowed on the plane if you don’t fill out quorentine form GOV fill in before you get to airport it will say time and get to airport early I know flight is early put if you fill that form in you will be ok and check about this test at Dubai to get back to U.K. not sure on this .dubai very safe mask worn everywhere temp checked everywhere one bad thing they try is telling you laws about bars in hotel not allowed to serve it’s rubbish the law has changed Everything is open but the hotels have lost a lot of staff . They also give you to forms to fill on the plane but get NHS test done two days before flight ,your result will be with you next day . The flight is usually full what ever they say but do try and distance you and always look at what they are offering the residents who are getting fantastic deals and the poor tourist who have made it over there took a great risk get a bit done so don’t take any bad service or bad management you are very important to the tourist tradeGood luck I go back again in 5 days time so must be good"
"Hi barry h, please don't encourage others to use the NHS COVID-19 PCR test. The NHS testing system is not there to be used for the purpose of international travel. “COVID-19 testing for the purposes of international travel is not available on the NHS”https:/…coronavirus-disease-covid-19Edited: 7:50 am, August 06, 2020 "
@ Barry - what 'law change' are you referring to about bars in hotels please?
But how to know my covid report because I am given this number is blocked
Ravi in #41 Which number Is “ blocked” please ?
"Hi there, can I ask how you got on? Where and when did you get your test done in UK?"
I'm just unsure of what to do to be honest! Im flying from Ireland on 30th Sept or 1st October. If the test in the airport is as quick as Ive heard it is I've no problem getting that but I start work on the 4th so I'm hoping I'll be all clear by then which Im assuming it wont take as long that but you have to plan for the worst and expect the best I suppose! Any guidance or advice would be welcome! Should I fly a day earlier just in case? Thanks
"Here’s a link to the current Covid testing requirements when travelling to Dubai, and, IMHO, those requirement are unlikely to change very much between now and when you are planning to travel...So you may need a clear Covid test to be done not earlier than 96 hours before you board your flight to Dubai..and another one before you fly home. https://www.dubaiairports.ae/"
Cheers I’ll get that done to be on the safe side!
Hi we are travelling to Dubai in 17th sep and we dont have to pay for test in uk. But belive we have to pay 360 dirhams in Atlantis in dubai but have heard you can get it done in dubai airport for free x
"@ Nicola - the 'free' option at DXB was on arrival (if needed for secondary testing) & the departure one was free for residents, has since moved and it's a rapid test not PCR.There are options at Atlantis as there are in many hotels, but you may be either paying a bit more money or waiting a little longer for results than if you were to go to the main clincs."
Hi so sorry to trouble you but how did you get on with your entry into Dubai and the Covid test/certificate? My son is due to go on the 7th September but not sure re providing a print out of an NHS email test result or whether he does need a private one?
"HiIf your son is flying with emirates he needs PCR test with a private company which will give you a certificate which shows you are negative. he needs this so he can be allowed on the plane. The test must be taken a maximum of 96 hours before departure. If he is flying with a different airline I don't think he will need one. You'll just have to check with the airline he is flying with.( I am flying with Turkish Airlines to Dubai from Manchester, so I don't need the PCR test). But he will get tested once he is in Dubai and he will have to self isolate till he gets the test results, which can take 5 - 72 hours.He must complete the ""health declaration form"" and give it to the staff at check-in. He can also get this form when arriving at Dubai but just to save time he can do it before so he doesn't have to wait.You will also need to complete the ""quarantine undertaking form"" which will be handed to you in the plane but you can do it before so you save time.He will also have to download the the COVID-19 DXB application on his smart phone and fill up the forms on the app. Forms such as ""personal information"", ""travel information"" and ""consent form (which is questions about symptoms and stuff)""here are the links to the ""quarantine undertaking form"" and ""health declaration form"" https://c.ekstatic.net/ecl/documents/dubai-a…https:/…dubai-health-declaration-form.pdfEdited: 6:04 pm, August 23, 2020 "
"@ mhg in post #51It may be prudent for you to check a few points, especially :-1) "" If he is flying with a different airline I don't think he will need one"" - ALL travellers to Dubai need negative PCR certificate to board, and have done since 01 Aug. Different airlines may have slightly different interpretations or additional policies, but you could be refused boarding if you don't have the docs at check-in.2) "" But he will get tested once he is in Dubai "" - this isn't necessarily true, as it's secondary testing they do in Dubai/DXB such as for specific countries or those showing symptoms or on screening. The aim of the rule needing negative test to board is to check BEFORE boarding, not after landing.The rest of your advice is sound, but please do check with Turkish and make provision for testing before boarding in MAN to avoid any issues.Please check >IATA Travel Map https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/world.phpFCO advicehttps:/…united-arab-emiratesDubai Airportshttps://www.dubaiairports.ae/"
"hi shaun, thank you, just checked with Turkish Airlines and I don't need a Pcr test to board the flight"
"@ MHG - fine, if they're saying that but just be aware of the rules mentioned that are explicit in saying "" All citizens, residents, tourists and transit passengers are required to obtain a negative COVID19 certificate before arriving into DXB or DWC.""Just because TK may not check & may allow you to board, doesn't mean you don't need one.Would you feel comfortable not having the test pre-boarding and then facing test on arrival, and quarantining until getting a result, and of course the risk of being positive (and all that entails)?"
"@ShaunMy test here in US will be a RT-PCR is that acceptable that you know of, still a PCRAlso I have read mixed things online, some places says neg test 96hrs prior to arrival in Dubai others places say 96hrs prior to boarding, The boarding would be considered the first flight from USA to LHR then on to Dubai right?"
"Yep, the rules are boarding time of the first outbound flight to test must be maximum of 96 hours.As often is the case, once the 'rules' were announced there were some 'updates' as well as 'interpretation' that suggested it's 96 hours of arrival in Dubai, so it is often confusing. The FCO advice is clear >>> "" All travellers to the UAE must have carried out a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test within 96 hours and received a negative result prior to their departure. ""As for the PCR tests - sorry, no idea on the specifics. If you're flying with Emirates, maybe check out their pages. They do have a PDF link from the 'designated laboratories' link in the paragram.>> https:/…However, it's not exactly clear so I'd suggest confirming with your carrier."
@ShaunThanks you are awesome :)
Hi I am looking for someone to clarify the PCR testing situation for travel to Dubai. I would like someone that has travelled from Glasgow to enlighten me where they got a private test and the price. So many confusing articles on the internet . Thanks
