"Hello!I fly with a group of five in 50 days from IAD to LHR with Virgin Atlantic. We plan to spend a week in Cornwall and several days in London. We have a house rental, hotel, train tickets as well as three days of excursions. My brilliant friend with 50 years of nursing under her belt says I have a ""moral responsibility"" to cancel (now) in light of recent developments with the Coronavirus. I argue that I want to ""wait and see"" and that the airline will take the lead and make the decision and refund our money. (Virgin already has a list of restrictions in place but they don't affect my group so far). I have read the thread on Coronavirus and think we should wait but welcome input regarding my argument that the airline will cancel. I know questions like mine are tedious but I will be grateful for input from far more seasoned travelers. Thanks."
If you cancel now you won’t get a refund. Why do you think the airline is going to cancel your flight? Neither the USA or UK are currently hot beds. Are you expecting much larger scale cancellations of international air travel in the coming weeks? Concern the Trump admin will try to drastically walk off the USA and prevent it quarantine reentering citizens coming from Europe? I think if you cancel it’s your personal choice and you’ll have to take the financial hit.
"Not tedious at all, not IMOI know of no reason to cancel that trip, not at this time. That's as good as 2 months away and in that 2 months anything could happen. It *could* all be over, under control, done and for the most part behind us . . . . or it *could* escalate and spread further afield, no one knows.I'll offer this thought, the UK is an island, a small island at that (in the bigger picture of things) and we are being pro-active on the subject. Here's the official UK Gov travel advice site covers every country & issue in the world . . . the Covid page is updated almost dailyhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/wuhan-novel-coro…"
What's your friend's name? Chicken Little?
"In my view your friend needs to have a more balanced approach to this issue.Life is not without risks - I'm due to visit the US shortly, ask her if I have a moral responsibility to cancel."
I don’t get where “Moral responsibility” comes into this - either it’s safe or it’s not. Right now the U.K. government’s view is its safe. If it becomes unsafe then you have the opportunity to make a rational decision informed by facts.
"Your friend sounds far from brilliant.A quick reality check. Ignore the hysterical reports on TV, 24hr news channels are lapping this up for something to report.This virus is nothing more than another respitory virus, no worse that the hundreds of others that are in existence. If your were unlucky enough to contract it; and you'd have to be seriously unlucky, then for the vast majority of people it's nothing more than a light flu.I'm not wishing to sound morbid, but 68,000 people a year die in the US alone from flu, many of whom had pre-existing conditions that made then vulnerable. Compare that to how many people who have globally died of this illness Common sense should rule, your not visiting a Ebola virus hotspot or anything."
I cannot imagine a situation where trans Atlantic flights are cancelled en mass due to a virus outbreak. The only time this has happened was 9/11.
It's not like there aren't any cases of Covid 19 in the USA.
Your friend with 50 years of experience needs to take a refresher course on the influenza virus!
"I gotta tell you, if we've gotten to a place 50 or 500 days from now that tatl flights are being cancelled due to covid-19 then we got much bigger problems than any of us can visualize. I mean like #viruszombieapocalypse bad.So just can't imagine we're heading for that.However, the moral responsibility to those we are responsible for in terms of personal safety, security and health is totally and deeply personal. To me your friend's point of view is at this moment terribly hysterical.Edited: 7:34 am, February 27, 2020 "
"50 years of experience or not, this is a novel virus, so she hasn't a clue about it."
"{sniggers}I've heard it called a lot of things Leyland . . . but ""Novel""? not a lotta folks considering it 'novel' right now - nice one, cheered me up!!"
Does your friend’s moral responsibility stance extend to contributing to the massive financial loss you'll suffer for following her advice?Let her decide what she does or doesn't do. Decide yourself. I can see no reason why yourvtrip threatens anyone
>>> My brilliant friend <<<I hope you were being ironic ....
"<< I've heard it called a lot of things Leyland . . . but ""Novel""? not a lotta folks considering it 'novel' right now - nice one, cheered me up!! >>I aim to please ;) Before it was christened Covid 19 it was known as the 2019 novel coronavirus."
"Why is is that people from outside the US continue to post incorrect figures regarding the number of Americans that die from the flu each year? Suggest you look at the link below, which shows the number of deaths for the last 10 years. Only the 2017-2018 flu season came close to the 68000 number, with last year's deaths being half of that.https:/…index.htmlPlease don't add to the hysteria."
"The point that was being made, was not to add to the 'hysteria' but to show that far fewer people are ill with this virus, and none have so far died in the UK.It was simply to demonstrate that there is nothing to worry about travelling to the UK."
Your friend has no say in the matter. Just stop discussing the matter. I certainly wouldn’t cancel. I agree that if airlines start cancelling trans-Atlantic flights then lost vacations will be the least of our problems.
"I'm a nurse too and I do not see the logic of moral responsibility here. The virus is already here. We have our first case of community spread already. Also, 50 years experience means she is in all probability retired and whatever she knows is from the news- same as me.Let me tell you a story that really happened. My wife's friend at work, a nurse, bought non refundable tickets to Seoul. She heard of the virus and asked my wife if she should cancel (going with her young child). I told my wife if she cancels she loses her money. Better wait and see. Who knows if South Korea or the US will issue a travel advisory/ban- then she will get wish- cancel the trip and a refund to boot. She can always cancel at the last minute anyway.Guess what. She cancelled. Lost her money. Now US airlines are allowing rebookings, and cancellations without penalty.https://www.ibtimes.com/us-airlines-waive-ca…"
A lot of time quick emotional reactions are costly.
"The populations in the US (327.2M) and the UK (66.7M) are two totally different things, so how does the flu mortality rate in the US need to be brought up solely in terms of the numbers of people that die? A more accurate comparison would be what the mortality rate is in the UK compared to the US. During the worst season in in 10 years, 2017-2018, the flu killed approximately .02 % of the US populationJust like with the flu, the mortality rate for the Corona virus will vary by sex, age-group , per-existing conditions. etc. Currently the Corona virus is estimated to have an average mortality rate of 2.1%. Those who fall into certain high-risk categories should be consulting their doctors for advise about whether or not to travel, not people on a travel forum.Neither the US or UK are currently considered high-risk areas for the corona virus, so while people should take precautions, travel between the two countries currently remains safe."
I very much appreciate the comments from everyone. You have been very helpful. Thank you.
Epidemic or infodemic?https:/…world-europe-51658511
Let's pretend that you knew you would not be able to fly in 50 days for some reason. Should you immediately cancel? All you get back are the taxes. So the self-centered equation is whether (cost of tickets * probability of airline cancelling the flight) > the taxes.In this case (the probability of the airline cancelling or allowing rescheduling plus the probability of the Covid-19 being resolved in 50 days ) * cost of tickets is almost certainly greater than the taxes. So you don't need to believe or not believe your friend. You just need to explain that it works out better financially to cancel late rather than early because of the airline's policies. If you are a manipulative person you might be able to distract her concerns about Covid-19 with complaining together about the stupid policies of airlines and other places. Complaining is a popular group sport.
"My above posting is flawed. It assumes I can't cancel later and get the taxes back. And yes, sometimes I forget to do something later and sometimes there are deadlines."
"JBB, 'novel' as in new, never seen before. 'My brilliant friend with 50 years of nursing under her belt says I have a ""moral responsibility"" to cancel (now) in light of recent developments with the Coronavirus' Your friend has the right to her opinion as do others.I disagree with your friend's view as I find it an overreaction, and I had about 30 years in the clinical area. The behaviour of COVID-19 has a steep learning curve, and as such basic measures such as handwashing and sneezing or coughing into an elbow can go some way to mitigate transmission.It's a bit late for containment, and trying to stop the movement of people and goods would have a nasty economic impact."
It's already having an economic effect with some share prices all over the place...
"Just out of curiosity, who would the moral responsibility be to?"
"You have to laugh at the touchiness of BarbP, she will defend every single comment made about America, someone put 68,000 flu deaths whilst it is an average of 61,000 per year for the past ten years, could well mean that 68,000 was reached a couple of times.The point being made was that worrying about visiting the U.K. and this virus should give you no more concern than going to the supermarket and standing next to someone with flu. The deaths from this new virus are 2% far less than with other influenzas. So Barb pull up your big girl knickers, grow up and stop being pedantic, not being American does not mean you cannot criticise one of the world’s worst health care systems.JackieEdited: 5:16 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Congratulations for arranging the travel and accommodation for 5 adults ... now you are finding out how completely #$@#$% frustrating that can be. If your friend wants to cancel she has her own PNR ... she can argue with Virgin herself, she will have to cover her costs for accommodation if that's not changeable."
Tell her friend to cough up her money and stay at home.The other 4 people can have a wonderful holiday!
"Finemind, if there are 5 of you booked, does it mean that the other 4 of you are still happy to go? Perhaps let your friend cancel her part of the trip, and the 4 of you still plan your holiday. IF anything comes up closer to your leaving day, that's when you consider the proper cancelling methods.Sounds like your friend is a real party pooper, seeing the worst in everything, :("
"Jackie, I suggest you reread the CDC figures for the last 10 years. that are in the link I posted. The range for the 10 years was from 12000-61000. Only once did it reach 61,000 people, so how can that be the average? No, it didn't reach 68000 a ""couple of times"". I suggest you go back to math class to learn how to compute averages.So sorry that you think it is pedantic to correct incorrect information that is being constantly posted here by people who don't know what they are talking about and/or can't be bothered to fact check information before posting it.How does providing accurate information correlate to defending a public health system? Rickz, who provided the inaccurate data, did not comment on the US health system, but you just can't resist taking a jab at everything American every time you can, and yet you travel here frequently. It must be nice to live in the UK where everything is so much better, at least in your eyes.I 'll pull up my ""big girl knickers"" as soon as you get off your high horse, but I don't see that happening anytime soon."
"Please read the stats properly.The same link from the CDC mentioned that the death rate estimates since 2010 Vary from 12,000-61000 deaths.  That same link shows that only that only one year's estimate has breached 61,000 (2017-2018).The 95% confidence intervals ( those numbers between a high and low)- only 3 years out of the 10 breached 61,000.Taking those diagnosed with the disease (symptomatic) vs.deaths, the death rates hover around 0.1-0.2 %As of today, the death rate between diagnosed positive for corona virus and dying is 2 %In defense of Barb, she is not defending the worlds worst health care system. We don't have a definitive cure for the flu. Maybe the NHS has? Care to share? All she is saying is don't give the wrong information about flu death rates. There is nothing wrong about that. I don't see her defending the US health care system with that statement.Funny, when someone here gives a wrong information about, lets say, on a visa question, people ar so quick to jump on that someone, even castigating that someone to please DO NOT give out wrong information.What is so different from flu death in the US?The most deadly flu was the Spanish flu of 1918 wherein the death rate was 20%"
"Barb, our answers have crossed.For future reference, current flu season as to this month.26 million diagnosed with flu. 14,000 dead. 0.05% death rate.If this was the corona virus, using Chinese data of 2% that would be 520,000 deaths.Using death rate data OUTSIDE of china (0.6%)= 156,000 deaths.CORONA is deadlier that the flu. There are more flu deaths simply because there are more people who got sick of it."
"I think you need to find new “brilliant friends”. Preferably ones who don’t appoint themselves the morality policeIf you cancel, you’re out all the money. No one owes you anything. You’re brilliant friend is apparently poorly informed"
"Sorry, but if your friend has ""50 years of nursing"" and this is the read she's got on this, then she's a) not as brilliant as you think and b) probably dramatically needs retraining as she's probably one of those nurses that insists on doing things ""the way they're always done"" and speaks ill of ""stupid kids"" who bring in new methods."
"Bigwwao, yes our responses crossed. Data from recognized health agencies such as the CDC and WHO support the fact that corona is deadlier than the flu. That is what people should be paying attention to, rather than posting incorrect statistics about how many die from the flu each year in the US. How is that any more relevant than the unmentioned number of UK residents who have died from the flu ? The OP is concerned with travel to the UK currently because of the corona virus, not the flu."
"I would think your friend trained in nursing around the same time as I did. I graduated in 1972. I haven’t worked for 50 years in nursing since then, but I do believe I have a better understanding than your brilliant friend of the likelihood of infection if I travel, versus staying at home and going to the supermarket! I’ve booked to travel in May-June from Australia to UK and Europe. As far as I’m concerned, I’m still going, still excited about our trip and will take the usual precautions everyone should take when travelling. Wash your hands!Edited: 12:47 am, February 28, 2020 "
There are five of you so why not just let those cancel who want to and those who still want to travel go ahead? If anyone wants to see overreactions take a look at the Italy forums which have been a mess all week.
"The data from CDC and WHO is merely raw data of the current numbers. Instead of squabbling over whether the UK or the US has the better health care system, why don’t you stop and think. Living conditions in China, access to high quality health care, general health status of the population? Do you think these approach the standards you expect in Western Europe and the US? If you think 2% is frightening, what do you think it might be in India, sub-Saharan Africa, or even South America?The “brilliant friend “ may have 50yrs experience innursing, but it seems she hasn’t learnt much from it. The risk in Cornwall, rather rural with no major transport hubs, is probably less than in any US city. Even London would worry me less than NYC or Miami.I agree with the others, don’t cancel unless the airline cancels and offers a waiver. It’s disappointing enough to lose a holiday, you don’t want a big financial loss as well. If the friend wants to cancel now she must make sure it doesn’t affect the rest of you. That is her moral responsibility."
"Please tell your ""brilliant"" friend that there in nothing more contagious than fear."
"Neapolitano - thanks for your reassurance that here in Cornwall is probably less likely than other places in the world. We think that too!But a local sixth form has sent a bunch of students home to self isolate after they came back from skiing in Italy. Right move, I think, better than closing the whole school."
"It's a good idea, if they do it! Teenagers and self isolating for 14 days would be pushing the limits I'd have thought, especially as they've been skiing so unlikley the type to live their lives in their rooms on the internet or playstation."
"I agree but hope the parents can perhaps have some control - even if it's a monetary bribe...But then, the parents and other siblings presumably are still coming and going. Does that not defeat the object somewhat?"
"Hi Neapolitano, just to clarify. Barb never squabbled about whose health system is better. She only insist that we use correct data in mentioning deaths due to the flu. Never mentioned anything about health systems at all. It was Jackie, with her now clear anti american sentiment, who said our health system is the worst in the world.How many times have I read a reply here to a post saying, "" I just googled it and have the answer in 5 minutes. "" or ""Google is your friend "" Apparently Jackie has unfriended google. :-))This is my last post re. this nonsense. To Finemind,Go and enjoy. Life is too short.  As of my posting, corona virus cases in UK is about 20. It is 50 in Germany.You are leaving in 50 days. I am leaving in 2 weeks for Germany. Now, I have only 30 years experience and does not consider myself to be brilliant but your friend is overreacting. Then again, the corona virus fatality is mostly in the elderly and your friend might be in her 70s she might have a point.Just take sensible precautions.Remember what FDR said- the only this we have to fear is fear itself. (kudo to Quakered)"
"My post wasn't addressed to Barb specifically, the discussion about case numbers and deaths was just not helping anyone. And for what it's worth, the number of cases in the US was reported as 60 when I looked an hour age."
"Hi Neapolitano,My posts on the virus cases was addressed to OP. He is going to a place with much less cases than where I am going. And I am going much sooner than him.That virus is going to be everywhere. The sooner we accept it the better for everyone."
"Hi bigwaowao, yes, we just have to assume that containment is now impossible and treat it like normal flu, albeit the mortality rate may be a bit higher. The response so far by governments and health agencies is doing more damage than the disease itself. I accept that a death is a personal tragedy for any family, but even normal flu is a potential killer. I hope you have a great trip."

"I agree with other posters that you should wait for the airline decision.My opinion is that the airfare might be the least of the Financial concerns for such a trip, even if you ultimately have to pay for new air tickets or for the air ticket change fees, ($200-$300?).Some Airlines do not have change fees upon cancellation when paying for a ticket with frequent flyer miles, and a few USA carriers have no penalty for cash tickets, as well.Probably the most catastrophic Financial liability starts with the cost for medical issues if there are problems with the virus. Myself would get the best medical coverage with no exclusion tricks for pandemics or other health issues, and an Air Evac contract to take you to your family support system at your HomeBase, where there might be more available hospital beds. Also I would add insurance to cover cancellation of lodging , tours, Transportation, Etc., which might be more of a concern than air-tickets."
"BellaHampshire, re your comment about the rest of the house still moving outside while the teen is self-isolated.... we may have had a similar situation here. Some students living with local families self-isolated before going to school, but no mention of the rest of the families.No cases in Ballarat yet, but perhaps good luck more than good management.Off topic a little- sorry, all."
"While I agree that self isolation is a good idea, it may not have been thought through properly!"
"@outsidee, I doubt any regular UK insurer would even consider providing the sort of coverage you suggest. You might get a one-off deal through a specialist private broker, but that's the sort of arrangement reserved for high earning footballers and media stars.Plague, pestilence, war and Acts of God are standard exclusions, and any pre-existing medical conditions must be declared. Some may lead to them denying you any cover at all. So the small print in the policy is crucial.Out of interest, where would you buy a policy like this in the US and what would you expect to pay?"
"@ Bella Hampshire .. It is possible but it does need careful planning. The person isolated should stay in one room, or zone of the house, preferably with own bathroom and with meals delivered to and eaten in the same zone. No, or minimal contact with others and good ventilation of the room. Lots of households are going to find this difficult, and it's not much fun for those in isolation so you have to wonder how effective the advice will be.I'm still undecided as to whether we shouldn't just roll over and accept we're all going to be exposed and we might as well just get on with it. We've learned to live with common flu, and many of us don't even bother with the flu vaccine although we know flu can kill."
Update: the brilliant friend is not one of our group but she has cancelled her own planned trip to Scotland in May and feels I (and my group) should do the same. We all have insurance and our rates varied according to age and any pre-existing medical conditions-one diabetic. Our Airbnb owner and our excursion director will doubtless be flexible should the crisis escalate and our hotel is able to be cancelled so our train tickets and airfare are the only inflexibles. Met with the group yesterday and everyone is in accord to wait and see but quite eager to travel in 48 days if things go well. Thanks for all your input. Much appreciated.
"Fingers crossed too!I wouldn't be concerned about any travel at the moment, just because it's no worse than flu really.My son and daughter in law and their families are going from Australia to Canada and Alaska in April (part of which is on a cruise) and they have two babies. They haven't yet even considered it could be unwise.And yes, Neapolitano, we both think like you too. And the self isolation won't be as bad for a teenager, who rarely leaves their room anyway, with plenty of stuff on the internet and social media to keep them amused!!!Edited: 8:10 am, February 29, 2020 "
I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you as well. I have an upcoming UK trip in April too and would not cancel unless it would be absolutely necessary.
"My trip to the UK for a hippo reunion at Dunstable is in May. No thought of any cancellation from me. Only from outside sources- like the gov't. Finemind, you made, in my honest opinion, a rational decision. Each to his own. Come travel time, it could be she saying to you- I told you so.. Or vice versaJust a note on the insurance. 2 nights ago I heard on the news that insurance carriers are not covering for corona related incidents. There was a cut off date though. if you bought, (don't quote me- the newscaster spoke real fast) your insurance before February, they will still cover for it. So just clarify it."
"Nea @#54, the lowest price I have seen for Med Evac policy is about $100 pp to cover a one-week trip. A one-year policy may be cheaper if you travel a lot or for extended periods. Some of these companies also offer policies for air evacuation for political turmoil or instability, be sure to check the fine print, as you say. I do not know if they sell to the UK. Some testimonials on the company websites by those that had claims, indicate they maybe quite useful. Stand-alone Med Evac policies are not insurance so there is no wait to be reimbursed for anyting.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…Edited: 11:46 am, February 29, 2020 "

"I don't know what #62 did to wake up this old thread, but it makes fascinating reading now. Two months ago OP was planning transatlantic trip two months hence (now), and a friend had the temerity to suggest this might not be such a hot idea. Posters on this thread had a field day castigating this friend...fear-monger, Chicken Little, just another flu, etc. etc. Looks like a lot of us seriously underestimated the impact of this virus."
"Oh yeah, a lot of posts in this thread didn't age well. Mind you, even a lot of experts misjudged the scale of what was to come."
"It was, after all, 'expert' led. How wrong many of us were to suggest there was no need to panic.PS - my Aussie family had their big trip cancelled by the airline and the cruise ship, quite soon after I posted.I wonder what the OP decided to do, or was forced to do?"
