"I know that this question has been asked a number of times, but I hope (with more time maybe) someone will have an answer. We're supposed to go to Maui in early September for a wedding, and have hotel reservations, and flights from LAX already. I'm wondering if that sounds realistic. As of a few days ago the wedding is still planned. We'll be at the Andaz, where the wedding is planned. We bought travel insurance, which I wouldn't normally do, but is probably a good idea considering the circumstances."
When did you buy the insurance? A lot of companies will not cover a pandemic. Check your policy!
"Hi Caribfans ... I agree with you that in time, you'll know if it's realistic or not. Perhaps by July you'll have a clearer indication. A few factors that will help with your decision -- if the wedding is still on- the cancellation policy for your Andaz booking- the airline's policy for refunds or credits for changes as a result of COVID-19I would keep monitoring those things and as Joan mentions, see what your insurance policy will cover.Fingers crossed for you (and the wedding couple & other guests) that it's safe to travel by then."
"Thanks very much! I’m traveling with my elderly mother so we bought the insurance shortly after we purchased the plane tickets, and I think our hotel can be canceled until 15 days or so before arrival. I think from reading other posts that the big question for anyone traveling before we have a vaccine is if we’ll have to quarantine while we’re there, etc. Luckily I’ve been to Maui several times so don’t need to go to Hana again or other tourist destinations."
You want to put your elderly mother on an airplane in early September? That would give me something to seriously think about. No disrespect but I'm 66 and wouldn't get on an airplane that soon unless it was an emergency.
"I am hopeful the 14 day quarantine will be waived by then. If it is not, then I cannot imagine the fiscal devastation the islands will face, if people are hurting now it will only get worse. Of course I say that selfishly as we also have a booking at the Andaz (my favorite!!) the week leading into Labor Day. Before heading out, I am interested to see what resort amenities will be available. If the pool can all of a sudden only hold 50% and there are less loungers etc etc, then it's not worth the $500 per night I'm paying. Their breakfast buffet is also a highlight, which I have already assumed will be more of a sit down affair. Hotels and resorts will have to rethink these resort fees if the amenities cannot be used.Edited: 6:06 pm, May 12, 2020 "
Believe me I don’t want her to fly but she’s insistent about it. Sadly she and my 93 year old father seem to be the least concerned about the virus. My father went to the gym days before California was shut down! I couldn’t stop her if I tried as she wants to go to her first grandchild’s wedding. I will be very careful about her social distancing.
"The cost benefit analysis is exactly what I keep trying to tell people about coming here. And when it comes to tourist activities-well, apply the same concept..........no luau is going to charge 135.00 a person and only seat 100 people, so they can be 6 feet apart. No boat is going to either. When did you buy your trip insurance? Before CV-19 really got going? Or after?"
I wonder if the hotel will in fact host the wedding. What if you don't go with your mom? ~ Colleen
"Gotta love grandpa and grandma. If I were to make that decision you wouldn't be able to talk me out of it either. Social distancing on an airplane won't happen. Anyway, there might or might not be a quarantine. There's a good chance if there isn't you will still need to jump through hoops when you come. There won't be any ""normalcy"" to anything."
We bought tickets 3/1 and insurance 3/7. Just for the airfare so not a big deal and we bought it in case she has an issue. These older ones who have no fear (though they’re the most likely to have severe possible outcomes) continue to amaze me. I feel so bad for my nephew and his fiancée but life happens I guess.
"Read the fine print.I doubt your insurance will be useful anymore. Most policies excluded CV-19 very quickly.........if she has something else that is unrelated it *might* cover.Many Kupuna (elders) I know are pretty stoic about it. Their view is that they would rather chance it and have had long lives........as long as they feel like they wouldn't make someone else sick.I doubt we will still have a quarantine in September. I think it will get lifted by July.Edited: 7:18 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"I see the California State University system has now cancelled ""in person"" classes for the fall term..........that is a wise and strong reminder of how contagious and dangerous this virus is. Again--another part of people's decision making process should be the medical care available here, versus at home. Most mainland people have far more options and more advanced medical facilities than Hawaii does.Your insurance will also not cover near as much of the cost of treatment/hospitalization in Hawaii. And it for sure won't pay the tax that's charged on all medical services and bills."
Is there a special tax on medical care and supplies charged to non residents?
"No, it's a matter of a lot of states don't tax medical care. They do here. I found my insurance here is reciprocal on the mainland."
"The GET tax is applied to EVERY service and good in Hawaii. Funerals, medical care, you name it.I have done what many others do, and gotten medical care on the mainland sometimes.........and it cost LESS than Hawaii under my insurance."
"Back to your question, no one knows. A treatment could come from an approved drug, summer could slow the spread, everyone could really behave and manage the riskOr, a second wave could come with no real treatment, HI could reopen and then reclose, and people could really blow it. We will see. You have plenty of time to change things if by July it is not looking good. I hope you can take a deep breath and let this play out for a while and not let it make you anxious. In the end, you will get married, somewhere, and it will probably be beautiful and meaningful regardless.I am assuming this is a small event. If it is a wedding of 100, then I am very skeptical."
"Did you purchase CFAR insurance? Travel insurance will not cover COVID-19 related issuesEdited: 9:17 am, May 13, 2020 "
"It's the OP's nephew getting married, not the OP :-).Like it or not...people SHOULD be considering possible medical costs if they want to visit Hawaii these days and months ahead. Most have been horrified at minor medical bills--you know, the broken legs from bike trips, broken arms from bike trips, dislocated shoulders from surf, broken ankles from surf...........the ""easy stuff"", LOL.Start talking ICU or more serious stays, it goes up dramatically. I posted about a stay I had at Maui Memorial within the last year......and I wasn't in ICU (there were no beds there). Even with great insurance, the bills were horrible."
