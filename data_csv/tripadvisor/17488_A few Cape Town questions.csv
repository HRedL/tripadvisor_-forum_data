"We've never been to Cape town so are on our first day of trip planning and I have a few questions that hopefully a few of you can answer:We are planning a budget trip as we have more countries in Asia. So any help on saving money are always appreciated!1. Do we need a car to travel around the Cape town city? Beaches? Or is it cheaper/better by uber or public transport? 2. How much money should we plan for food per day for 2 of us?( No fine dining...but no burgers with fries every day either...) Breakfast, lunch and dinner included?3. We don't want to do any public tours or creepy places such as the Jail island or whatever the name is. We are more into nature, beach, wildlife, etc. Any specific places that can be recommended? We are thinking to spend around 4--5nights in Cape Town and perhaps 3 days around wineries(we don't really drink...but like the feel and nature of wineries. As I understand at least for this portion a car would be of a great benefit and cheaper too.Anything else?4. Are there any budget type safaris near Cape Town or even perhaps from Johannesburg where our flights initially lands and then departs.5. What's the cost of taxi or bus to the centre where most of the hotels are?6. What is/are the best area to stay at in Cape Town( hopefully not far from the waterfront and places to eat)7. My wife found a few places in Joburg where visitors can take photos with a few animals( cheetahs, lion cubs,etc). Is there a similar place near Cape Town available by any chance?8. What's the best/cheapest website to book a roundtrip flight from JNB to CPT?"
"2: R100-150 breakfast, R150-200 lunch, R200-350 dinner. That's per Peterson7: Please don't do it. https:/…https:/…Edited: 1 year ago "
"Sorry don't know who Peterson is: no idea where auto-complete found her! Should have read ""per person""."
"Thank you for the food information as well as the links @ 7. Even though what was said there in those links is not entirely true, it certainly has a number of valid points I will relay to her so that perhaps she will change her mind. I guess another alternative would be for us to find budget-type safari instead to see them in their natural habitat."
"What in that link Auntie posted is not entirely true? The wildlife kept in captivity so you can interact with for your entertainment are treated cruelly and die terrible deaths - many in canned hunting. Awful thing for us to force on any living creature for fun. If you don’t want to go, don’t. There’s no changing someone else’s mind. Just don’t go. Explain why, hopefully others will choose not to go too. Food will be less than at home. But I have no idea what you’ll be eating or drinking. Eating local foods will be less than imported. I don’t know who calls it Jail Island but Robben Island is quite interesting and is historically significant in the history of S Africa. It was my most memorable thing we did in Cape Town. Cape Town is a beautiful city. Other destinations in S Africa are better for nature, beaches, wildlife. Safari in S Africa can be quite affordable. Rent a car from Johannesburg and drive to Kruger. Stay in the park accommodations, eat in restaurants or cook for yourselves, drive around to see the wildlife. We go as often as we can, it’s our favorite thing to do anywhere. See www.sanparks.org for info, availability, booking. Stay in a hotels, Airbnb’s, guest houses, hostels. All budgets available. You’ll spend a lot for a flight. Don’t nickel and dime yourself on experiences. Save where you can, splurge where you should. Right now the exchange rate is very good. By the way - Cape Town is in S Africa on the African continent, not Asia. Not sure why the Asia reference."
"Thank you for the tips cbir,""asia"" mentioned because that's where we are going next...As for the animals. Not entirely true because it is the truth. I had 2 friends who volunteered/worked at 2 of those places for 3 years, documenting all they've done. Not all of them are abusive as the articles put out( which if you read is only their opinion and not a fact). Bad people are everywhere,but it's our duty to do research. Feeding these animals is expensive, tourism is the only way to help to pay for that and many other expenses. Some of these places do a lot of good and not everyone has cubs every month for tourists to play with. This is why it's not a good idea to judge. Not everything is white and black. Again, thank you for the other tips you provided. PS. I still don't understand why people pay to see a prison...Maybe it's just me as I saw enough deaths,violence real prisons(as a visitor, not inmate)and war zones in my lifetime and have no desire to see any more.Cheers"
Just confirmed our tickets. We are bypassing J'burg. Any tips on National parks and possibly safaris within reasonable drive from Cape Town would be appreciated. We have 9 days in total in Cape Town. First 4 days are allocated for the beaches and then we can travel around for the rest.Wife is hoping to see penguins and possibly snorkel/swim with seals.
"You must realise that Cape Town beaches are nice to look at but the water can be freezing all yearand not to pleasant for swimming.and the wind can blow A great pity to don't think Robben Island is a prison It was a prison now its interesting to go and learn about the history of our wonderful Nation No dark dungeons there .But everyone to his own .I too don't approve of animal sanctuaries A visit to the ZOO would serve the same purpose .Please read up more about South Africa before you do any bookings .Look up the South African National Park Website . Read a bit about the history and why and how Kruger and the parks came about.www,SANParks,org"
Think you need to do more research as some of your comments are quite amazing.
"Re the ""opinions"" in the links I posted:The National Council of SPCAs (SPCA is equivalent, I believe, to your Humane Society?) is a statutory body with rather more weight than a peddler of opinions. I consider Dr de Waal's contribution is evidence-based rather than an opinion."
<<Wife is hoping to see penguins>>Not sure if you could fit it in but we stayed overnight at Boulder's Beach and during the night the penguins come off the beach and walk through the town. it was quite amazing to see this and worth the overnight visit for us.
I have been to the Lion park in Joburg where you can take photos with baby Lions who are younger than 6 months. amazing experience actually
You are based in New York but you state you have more countries in Asia? I suggest go visit AsiaEdited: 1 year ago 
Probably not an amazing experience for the animals though.
