"I don't have any tickets or boarding passes to prove I was on a particular flight which was delayed.are Thomas Cook obliged to give me this information if asked to do so? Thanks, Al K"
why not ask them?
What about printing your credit card bill out and blocking out the other transactions as proof if someone needs to see you were on the flight ?Edited: 4 years ago 
Still waiting to hear from them!! Just wondered if they are maybe stalling?!
Are you just wondering aloud ? If so wonder onEmail itinerary or cc statement will workEdited: 4 years ago 
>>> What about printing your credit card bill out and blocking out the other transactions as proof if someone needs to see you were on the flight ?<<<I can't see how that would prove the OP was on a specific flight though ?Edited: 4 years ago 
"""What about printing your credit card bill out and blocking out the other transactions as proof if someone needs to see you were on the flight ?""All that proves is you made a purchase from Thomas Cook - it doesn't provide any flight details or confirmation you were a passenger on a delayed flight.I know there are some no win no fee sharks entering this area of business - you might want to consider their services."
"""I don't have any tickets or boarding passes to prove I was on a particular flight which was delayed.""Have you not got an email confirmation of your booking?"
"I don't have anything all to prove I booked holiday or flight,this happened back in April 2014,and have thrown all docs out.ive only just become aware that I may be entitled to some compensation."
"to be honest, as you have not even known about the possibility of compo for a delay, why even bother now trying to resurrect something that you have already forgotten about?"
"""to be honest, as you have not even known about the possibility of compo for a delay, why even bother now trying to resurrect something that you have already forgotten about?""=====Precisely. Have some ambulance chasing lawyers been running commercials or setting up stalls outside supermarkets by any chance?"
You could try a data request to Thomson. However you'd walked away from the experience and now you've seen there could be a few quid it it your suddenly interested in compo. Personally I'd let it go but the thought of compo makes plenty do odd things.
Why do you think you are entitled to compensation? You do know not all delays are eligible for compensation. What was the reason for the delay? Do you even know the date?Surely if anyone wants to make a claim they have to take some responsibility for having basic information. A CC statement proves nothing unless there is a PNR in the reference.
"Just jumping on the new "" claim culture"" epidemic that is sweeping our country,that was recently introduced to us by yourselves,my American buddy...."
it is called....greed!
It's called owt for nowt where I come from Pet! Shy bairns get nee sweets!
"You haven't mentioned the reason for the delay, or its duration. Both are factors in determining if compensation is due or not."
"Technical problems, four and a half hours"
