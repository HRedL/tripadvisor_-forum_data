"Hey guys, Nikki here. I planned a trip to Thailand (my first one actually) for this year but I guess everyone is alert of the current Covid-19 situation nowadays. Section says I should ask a question but I don't have one In specific. To be honest I would like to hear you guys, how you feel about...everything really...Like; Do you think there will be a 'high season' this year starting from November? How do you feel about the precautions the airlines are introducing (for example Qatar Airways), also plane ticket prices and stuff (mine got around 150$ more expensive in the last month).Do you think everything will be changed in Thailand after that, not just at the beginning but maybe forever (strong word, I know)?Seems like a lot of questions for a guy who says he doesn't have one, but those are more like topics to share your opinion on.Be safe all of you!"
"So far there is no sign tourists will be allowed back in Nov.If you can afford it, fly business class. I would not want to sit in the may be crowded back.For now I would not worry about travelling by plane to anywhere."
"Of course the straight answer to all the above is no body knows.There is a lot of speculation in many places about a so called second wave of this virus of course if this happens it will put recovery back even further. I certainly would not anticipate 'high season' being anything like it would normally be this year at all, as for ""ever"" well people are resilient so I am sure some form of normality will resume eventually but it could be a slow process."
"The outcome of the different high / low seasons will dictate much of what happens later in the year.Thailand will remain closed for a long time yet. But, it’s low season so not peak time for mass tourism in the country. However, which hotels and even airlines will be able to survive until November time?Further north in Europe, every country seems to be doing the reverse and opening up. None want to miss out on the lucrative high summer holiday season. But, if all this goes wrong and infections take off again, God knows where we go from there.Just sit tight, watch the news and politics, and don’t book anything."
"""Thailand will remain closed for a long time yet."".How do you know this?Unless you consider July to be a long time, ppl scaremongering posters with answers that are simply not known doesn't help.https:/…complete-end-to-lockdown-on-july-1"
"Any country ought to be careful about which nationalities it allows to enter.One would guess that Thailand will open up gradually to international tourists according to how their origin country is dealing with the Covid19 business. For example Thailand might admit those from Zealand well before those from Brazil?Fingers crossed for December for most European countries, but there will likely be hoops to be jumped through."
"#4That's great! I hadn't seen this - just a report earlier today that they were looking as far away as October for opening doors.Nevertheless, Bill's points are also the way I think, and the opening up of Europe will be the making-or-breaking of how this virus is going to run."
"The Thai government has apparently decided to lift all restrictions within Thailand by the end of June. International flights to Thailand are likely to resume in July but I suspect not every nationality will qualify to enter initially. A second wave of infections may come to colder countries in the northern hemisphere this coming autumn. Most Asian countries (including Thailand) have been very disciplined and I don’t expect Thailand to be affected.Unfortunately, there is a notable lack of discipline in certain other countries.."
"#7There is most certain lack of discipline. I can not speak of countries like India or Brazil for example, which look like most affected right now, but for sure I can say some words for Europe. Here in Bulgaria for example people 'got tired' of this virus, mean that we have huge economic issues because of Covid-19, many people have no jobs, no income and they just stop obeying that much to the orders. Don't get me wrong, 80% of the people are wearing masks but there is no sign of social distance, people are gathering especially when the weather is nice, many restaurants are working pretty full with clients (terraces only but still...) and for weeks now the number of infected is dropping significantly which is great of course but I don't get it...When we all thought that because of all that things will get worse...well, thing are getting better. Can say the same thing for few other Balkan's countries. UK also...Really hope that everything will get better soon."
"There is no way to predict what the ""Thai government"" will do. Everything the ""Thai government"" does often comes down to the whims of a select few. In the US, in the beginning, there was a 15 day lockdown in order for hospitals to sort things out. The hospitals got it handled, tens of millions were spent on empty field hospitals, the death rate of INFECTED patients is less than 1%, and the US is now into its third month of lockdown. Predictions?"
"Oct. 6 — the number of Covid-19 infections in the US is currently over 1,778,500. The number of fatalities: some 103,800. That’s about 5.85%. (Source: https:/…countries ) Where did you get 1%?"
"I can't recall the source; there are far too many ""trackers""However, when it comes to number, here is some insights from the Illinois governor's press conference: https://youtu.be/lPOxjvFVVew"
"Contrary to the right.wing narrative that seeks to minimize the disease, the CDC issued strict guidelines on how deaths from Covid-19 are to be reported, and that relies on a confirmed diagnosis, if not from a positive lab test, then from the established set of symptoms as evaluated by an experienced clinician. In fact, most experts think that deaths from Covid-19 have been UNDER-reported. For instance in New York the medical examiner was overwhelmed and was not able to determine cause of death in a flood of cases, so they were NOT listed as Covid fatalities. Many people died at home before they could reach a hospital or get treatment.: https:/…As for Covid being listed for every death that “wasn’t a gunshot wound or a car accident,” the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners termed that allegation “ridiculous.” https:/…"
Strict guidelines. Got it! I guess Illinois didn't get the memo.

"Like I said, I guess Illinois didn't get the memo."
"And Illinois has the 3rd highest Covid deaths (USA)........go figure.IL is #6 by population, and #12 by density.Edited: 11:19 pm, May 29, 2020 "
check that.... IL is #18 by density (2015)
"NY and NJ, alone, account for just about half the US death total and a quarter of all US cases. These are two of the "" Integrity in Government"" poster children"
"i was going to post,but i cant find my crystal ball!"
"What I’m fervently hoping is that when and if a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, Thailand — and most other tourist destination countries — makes vaccination compulsory for all incoming travellers and the renewal of all long-time visas. No ifs, ands or buts. Only then will international travel become safe again."
"Is your last name ""Gates"" ?"
No but I admire Bill and Melinda Gates and how they’ve been using their billions to do good for the world. And don’t subscribe to any whacko conspiracy theories.
"I know your last name. It was rhetorical. Since your implication is that anyone who goes against the hysterical narrative is a ""conspiracy theorist"", I will point out that some might be of the opinion that anyone still living in fear is a sheep.If you look at my posting history on this subject, early on I was suggesting great caution. Personally, we have been wearing masks, when on public transportation, and in dense crowds, for years. I had the privilege of discussing COVID with an infectious disease specialist, with no axe to grind. I asked why the big concern. She said that everyone is always prepared for the annual flu season. There are vaccines, treatments, supplies, and most importantly, BUDGETS to deal with it.Then an ""unknown"" pops up. In a field where everyone is waiting for the ""inevitable big one "", everyone considers this could be it. As this has wore on, and prediction after prediction have come up bogus, one really has to re-examine the hysteria that has been whipped up. Politics of the disease has become more an issue than the disease itself, not just in the States, but globally. This whole pandemic thing should wind down soon. With what's going on in Minneapolis, Atlanta, and Louisville, there are whole new seeds of division. Without the US media whipping up COVID hysteria, things should settle down ...."
""" makes vaccination compulsory for all incoming travellers and the renewal of all long-time visas. No ifs, ands or buts.""Compulsory ... HELL NOI'm not anti-vaccine, for the ones I've already received as a youngin, but I don't even get the 'useless' seasonal flu vacine (averages 40 % effective). I will never get a covid vaccine. Or any other new silly untested (for the long haul) stuff they come up with and want to inject in my body.It's MY body.Gates doing good for the world .... vaccine safe .... y'all really do fall for that MSM BS. I guess if you hear it 1000 times, it must be true.Programming the brain.....101Edited: 8:27 am, May 30, 2020 "
""".... for the ones I've already received as a youngin, but I don't even get the 'useless' seasonal flu vacine (averages 40 % effective).""Interesting definition of useless!"
"@bill2p,I support your idea."
Did anybody read the OP's question about travelling to Thailand?Or is he looking for a vaccination?
"When and if there’s a safe and effective vaccination available (and that’s a big if) the surest way for Thailand to make sure incoming travellers are not bringing the disease with them, is to require them to have successfully received the immunization — however many doses that requires. So requiring a vaccination certificate upon check-in and/or at Immigration would be the easiest and cheapest way to ensure millions of travellers are properly protected. No vaccination and you wouldn’t get on the plane or enter by land. The airlines would also be glad of this because they’d be able to pack theIr planes again and relax all the disinfectant measures they’ve had to put in place.And if they also make the vaccination mandatory for long-term foreign residents, by refusing visa extensions without a certificate, that would easily take care of a vulnerable part of the population, since many of them are older and likely to have pre-existing conditions. If you objected to the vaccine, that would be your prerogative, but you would not be able to stay in Thailand if you refuse (and might still need it to go somewhere else). I think most Thais would be compliant with vaccination, especially if the vaccine were given at no or very low cost. China’s authoritarian government could probably just order their citizens to take it.The main reason this became a world public health emergency so quickly was the ease of international travel, and this eliminates that vector. I would hope the EU, Canada, Australia and other big tourist destinations also follow suit. That would cover many millions of travellers every year, and would play a big part in getting the billions of people vaccinated that would be required for “herd immunity.”There’s plenty of precedent for this. Thailand still requires yellow fever vaccinations for anyone coming from the countries where it’s endemic. I seem to recall when I was a kid having to get shots before an international trip (maybe that’s only because my father was in the military). Here in Europe, we all have our yellow immunization passports that I get updated every year when I have my flu shot."
"If you get your wish, Bill, one of my friends who visits ofter will no longer be able to visit. his allergies make many vaccinations unwise."
"Bill, you really need to do some in depth research of your own. It would be hard to reply to your thoughts without offending you. #1 ... there is no pandemic. Once accepted, a conversation could continue.If total deaths were to hit half a mill, that's still only 0.0065 % of the world population. Doesn't even match the amount of children under 5 years old that will die from Diarrhoeal disease. Which most never even heard of, unless actually reading some of my earlier posts.Funny........1/2 mill kids under 5 yrs old........and not MSM drama, no 'Pandemic' declaredWonder why ? Probably because it fits in with the do-gooder Gates vision of a 5 billion max world population. Only a couple billion more to kill off, and he'll be happy.""Diarrhea kills 2,195 children every day—more than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined 1. Diarrheal diseases account for 1 in 9 child deaths worldwide, making diarrhea the second leading cause of death among children under the age of 5""Please enlighten yourself, then return for a constructive conversation."
"Sad part is, most of those 2195 deaths a day are preventable. 800+ K a year.But billions get thrown at Big Pharm for the ineffective vaccines.....every year. Priorities of the elite are profits, not saving lives."
"Ask yourself why, they are allowed to die. A simple thing as providing, fresh, drinkable water, and surely within the means of the billions thrown at UN & WHO. Surely there some money left over from self indulgent international summits & luxury conferences they treat themselves to.BUT ... here's a term that should ring a bell, they are 'non-essentials', and don't contribute to the grand plan. So simply a part of the depopulation. Your country probably signed on to it decades ago, most did. Running behind schedule though, so drastic measures are thought up all the time. Here a war, there a war, just chippin' away at the total of 7.7 billion. Maybe a pandemic, to test how controllable the populous are. Apparently very. Also help insure they control the money, as SME are suffering the worst, and who needs that kind of competition and free thinking people. Employees are so more controllable.Making the world a safer place for everyone, well, the essential folks. Of course you can't call it depopulation, but simply 'sustainability'. Agenda 21 ... google that and read up on it. Missed their 2021 target date, so this next decade, of dumb-ing down the masses, control of any and all info (news), should be interesting, and ensure the 2030 date is possible.Keep watching MSM, as it's been proven to be the perfect programming platform.Edited: 12:40 am, May 31, 2020 "
"""It would be hard to reply to your thoughts without offending you. #1 ... there is no pandemic. Once accepted, a conversation could continue.""Not Me, what gives you the qualification to make this statement? Google and the club of conspiracy theorists?"
"Actually just a wee bit of free thought, and the numbers....unless you think 0.0065 % of the population is something to panic about. If this is a pandemic, and the world economies are coming to a screeching halt, then why aren't the 800+k children (500+k under 5 yrs old) that die yearly, considered a pandemic, or not even mentioned in the MSM. Most from preventable infections. I guess that many children dying isn't worthy, and doesn't mean much to y'all.Hate to see how y'all would react if something serious in the world events actually happened."
"I have yet to see any real evidence of anticipated ""overrun"" hospitals. But, I have seen the empty field hospitals on which we spent tens of millions preparing for the ""wave""."
"Those endorsing mandatory vaccines for all, should enlighten themselves to how some, most are made now. Newer is not always better. Injecting things into one's body should be a voluntary experiences.https://www.youtube.com/watch…"
