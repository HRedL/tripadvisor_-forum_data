Anyone know where you can get masks?
My local independent chemist in Watford. £1.50 for a basic mask with a maximum of 6 per person.
"It doesn't say that passengers have to wear masks, it says they have to cover their faces. It quite specifically says that can include covering your nose and mouth with your own clothing. A scarf worn Western cowboy bank-robber style is fine. I've been using my keffiyeh brought back from Bethlehem when out and about in shops. A 1960s Peter Wyngarde turtle neck would do just as well..."
"Me too. I have a keffiyeh that I bought in Petra which still being used now. It’s so versatile as you can use it for a headscarf, scarf or a face mask."
My FB feed is full of ads for masks--I bought a couple from a local maker/seller.
"I got one on Amazon for a tenner took just over a week to be delivered. There are better value ones available on there but they need to be imported from Overseas so take about 6-8 weeks to arriveIt’s probably worth looking in to getting one. I’m pretty sure face coverings will soon be mandatory at for all public transport and for going into shops.Edited: 4:56 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"£10?? Lots of posts about making them out of kitchen roll, paper and rubber bands."
"Kitchen roll and paper isn’t any good it needs to be made out of cloth.It’s possible to make one out of an old T-shirt but I’m useless with things like that. I would probably have completely ruined half a dozen T-shirt and still not managed to make a half decent one, hence why I had no problem parting with a tenner for one."
T-shirt fabric is equally as useless.
"I have some motorcycle ""buffs"" which would probably do the job and of course they're washable."
"If you cannot get masks quickly from the Internet, many offered ... see Amazon or E bay, and you need to buy urgently, then DIY masks, used often by Decorators, House painters etc, from a B&Q or hardware store could be possible. Home made masks, scarves etc will only prevent you, possibly, spreading the virus, if you are a-symptomatic.Keep well allAnthony K"
"If your mask isn't a respirator, then it's just a placebo, whatever it's made of. It's only significant effect is to make you feel safer. If it makes someone in a supermarket feel better because I'm wearing one, then kitchen roll will do. I'm not wasting money lining the pockets of an Amazon profiteer.Edited: 2:47 am, May 08, 2020 "

"Re Post 12 ... I bought three of the Black, very often seen, material masks, on E bay, some weeks ago. For less than £4, including postage. They are, at least washable. I look like a Bank Robber, in mine, and it is uncomfortable, especially every time I breathe out and my glasses steam up.Better than nothing, perhaps.CheersAnthony K"
"Too late .When the initial discussions were taking place back in February and March , whenever face masks were being mentioned the advice from virologists was that masks were of little use . The reason was that the virus was so small that it could penetrate the material of the mask.Another reason was that untrained wearers would touch the mask and then contaminate other surfaces They would lift their masks repeatedly and not remove them properly and not discard them safely Now we are being told that there is some benefit to wearing a mask More mixed messagesWhich is it ?Edited: 3:30 am, May 08, 2020 "
"CDC do recommend they should be worn so I’m happy to take their advice.https:/…diy-cloth-face-coverings.htmlPeople in Asia who have more experience with this type of thing than us tend to use them a lot and countries such as Czechia, Austria and most of Germany have made them mandatory, countries that have a very good record of dealing with this outbreak.Edited: 3:43 am, May 08, 2020 "
"So true. I have, for many years now, noticed ""Orientals, mainly from Japan,"" wearing them, all of the time, in London, Paris, Barcelona & New York, where I go most often.Keep wellAnthony K"
"""It’s probably worth looking in to getting one. I’m pretty sure face coverings will soon be mandatory at for all public transport and for going into shops.""How long does it take a Government to come up with a scientific assessment as to whether masks are benficial or not. Not as if the matter isn't important.They should do the right thing for once."

The best endorsement I have heard to date is the odd comment that they *might* be modestly useful of benefit in limited circumstances, if worn correctly .To date the guidance on the use of masks is one of few things the Government has got right."
There were patterns doing the rounds on FB for making them from bras. (True story)
"#19 what you are saying is correct in the sense that the only way to protect yourself with a face mask is to wear a ‘clinically graded’ surgical one.What a cloth covering can do is decrease the chances of you, if you are asymptotic passing the virus on. If everyone were to wear a face covering in public places then the risk of transmission in those places is reduced. Hence the slogan that has been adopted in several countries where face coverings in public places are mandatory ‘I protect you, you protect me’."

I know a litle about filtration et al, I can assure you it does not work that way. It is well meaning to say it does, but its totally unfounded and possibly misleading.The latest I have heard from politicians is unbelievably, that wearing a mask will assist people regain confidence to go out and about, go figure!Keep to the social distantancing rules is the mantra.Edited: 5:44 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"I wish you no offence and I have no doubt you do have some knowledge on the subject, but as I posted earlier, the CDC recommend using them and I am far more likely to trust what they say over someone on a travel forum."
"Ask yourself, if the scientific evidence on mask wearing was so compelling it would have been a mandatory requirement from the outset. Rather than politicians belatedly being seen to be doing something after the event.Edited: 6:00 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"@Marty, we clearly don’t agree here perhaps in time one of us will be comprehensively proved right but for the time being we can agree to disagree.Stay safe."
