"Hey guys,We have booked our tickets to NYC from the 15th of May to the 24th. We can see on the news that the situation is getting worse with corona and we are thinking whether we should call the trip off or not. What would you do?"
I’d wait until about May 1st and see what the situation is then.
"1. I would read all of the other posts asking the same thing.2.I would read all of the info on the CDC site, the NYGovernor's site, your own country's guidelines, the State Department website. The travel information in the Wall Street Journal and NY Times.3. I would call the airlines/hotel and see what refunds etc are offered.4. I would wait as long as possible, depending on refunds available.5. I would probably go."
A lot can happen between now and May. I don't live in NYC but visit frequently for theater trips. I still plan to keep my mid April trip and my late May trip but if things get significantly worse then I will cancel the April trip. If I fell into the high risk category due to other health issues then I would be more likely to cancel.
***What would you do?***I'd go.
There's more chance of being run over by a cyclist on the Brooklyn Bridge or at a crosswalk in Manhattan than catching the Corona virus.
"I'd wait and see first. My feeling is things will get worse from now, but May is a long way away still. Things such as Broadway shows might start to close to prevent the spread, other popular sights might also close. Missing out on all this might be a downer so you prefer to cancel.Hopefully your hotel is cancellable, so that's no problem. You might be able to change your flights to another time, or get a refund.Wait and see though, you've still got time.But if you do go, make sure you've got hand sanitiser on you and wash you hands often."
Plenty of threads on this already with people asking the same question.
There are really multiple areas of concerns here..IF you are persons of an age or health condition where the risk of illness can have serious consequences The risk some activities you may want to do while here may be cancelled or restrictedI think the advice in #2 above is a good way for you to assess your particular situation and help you to decide
Is your home area safe from this?
My home area is where I live and not several thousand miles (and dollars) away.Im currently atill plannong on visiting in early April but if everything is going to be closed and i risk being quarantined then the plan will change. Currently im not goung to make a call until a couple of days before the trip.
"Are you also Raluca, Chris? TA doesn’t allow multiple handles.NYC is as safe as your home. Would you tell us not to visit your area? Do you have enough info to properly advise a stranger on the internet? Unless you live in Tristan da Cunha, I am betting you can’t do that."
"No one can predict what the situation will be at the time of your trip. If you do decide to come, be sure to have good medical insurance coverage. This is a general rule, but more important now."
The situation is getting worse all around the world. No one is sure yet how bad it will get in various places and also don't know your health history (if I had any underlying health problems or had small kids I would stay home).You need to watch the news and decide when you get closer to the date of your trip - but do understand that it will likely reach every country fairly soon.
What does having small kids have to do with coronavirus?Indications show that children have been no more affected than adults and those that have had it have had mild symptoms.https:/…children-faq.html
"Northern Traveller, i dont have a clue what you are babbling about woth your bizarre comments. Im sharing my thoughts like everyone else. People being unsure about travelling around the world while it is gripped by mass hysteria is a normal thing to be concerned about."
">>>There's more chance of being run over by a cyclist on the Brooklyn Bridge or at a crosswalk in Manhattan than catching the Corona virus.<<<Well, the odds of that are infinitesimal; a more apt comparison would be the odds of being struck & killed by a car or truck.(Honestly, why is a discussion of coronavirus being used as an occasion to hate on cyclists?)"
"*** Honestly, why is a discussion of coronavirus being used as an occasion to hate on cyclists?)***Who was hating on cyclists?"
"Wash your hands, come on over, enjoy!Poppa"
This is kinda hilarious.https:/…1236782260981989376
"We are booked to fly the same time as you. We also have tickets to a couple of shows and to the SOL while we are there. We do have insurance in place but would be unlikely to get a refund unless the WHO expressly states it as a no go zone, the USA bans flights arriving from the U.K or the U.K is put on lockdown and we are unable to go anywhere. At present we are still very much planning to go - we are 2 adults under 50 and a 11 year old child so all in the low risk categories. We would bring lots of antibac wipes and we practice good handwashing already. I have checked with my insurance company and we have medical coverage to help us over there if needs be so as long as we are well at the time and allowed to fly we still plan on going.I am not particularly worried about getting the flu - i'm more concerned we would get over there and it wouldn't be a fun trip and the things we planned to do would be cancelled. However, we are doing what the others suggest and keeping a close eye on the appropriate websites and monitoring the situation and will decide at the beginning of May, depending on what the situation is then. At the moment we are still very much planning to, and hoping to, go and have a great time."
"I am saying two things, Chris:1) Raluca started this thread, you seem to have taken over replies. Using multiple names, if both are you, is against TA policy2) You ask if NYC is safe for a May visit. I ask if your area is safe for a May visit. The answer is the same. NO ONE KNOWS."
"Personally, I would assess the situation a few days prior to the trip, being conscious of any cancellation deadlines."
"I’m booked for the end of April. Living in London risk is similar (crowds, public transport, etc) so if travel is allowed and I’m not going to be quarantined on arrival, I will travel."
">>>What does having small kids have to do with coronavirus?<<<If I had small kids, and was travelling without them, I would worry about being quarantined and unable to see them."
You've gotta ask yourself a question
"Right now - I would plan on going before the coronavirus apocalypse hits. Check off those bucket list items ASAP as nobody knows what tomorrow will bring. Heck, at my age, I don't even buy green bananas anymore. The end is near."
“We have booked our tickets to NYC from the 15th of May to the 24th. We can see on the news that the situation is getting worse with corona and we are thinking whether we should call the trip off or not. What would you do?”I would not go . I would stay home-and avoid crowds as much as possible and continue to preform all the other precautions to avoid contracting the virus. A vacation or holiday is supposed to be care free. For me traveling at this time it’s not carefree not at all.If I am to be quarantined I want to be home.
"We have a trip booked for the middle of April, visiting NYC for 3 days and then a 4 day cruise to Bermuda. Unless they shut NYC down and cancel our cruise, we will not be canceling our trip.I am not worried about this virus, but that's just me. The numbers don't even come close to the number of people that have been diagnosed and died from the flu this year, but we don't see that on every front page. Literally, nearly half of my department at work has either had the flu or an immediate family member has had it. So far, not a single coronavirus case. I'm not doing anything differently that I don't already do either, as far as germs and cleaning. I already do everything the CDC recommends plus some. We don't even sleep on hotel sheets or use their towels. I take my own from home, but that's just because I know mine are really clean and sanitized. I don't think canceling a trip (holiday) is something anyone can tell anyone else to do. We have to make that decision for ourselves.If you choose to still travel, I hope you have a fantastic time!"
Raluca and FatChris are two separate people as far as I can see. One is travelling in April and the other in May.
"***I am not worried about this virus, but that's just me. The numbers don't even come close to the number of people that have been diagnosed and died from the flu this year, but we don't see that on every front page. ***There is a lot of hysteria being spread, I fully agree with the above. The media are notorious for sensationalizing stories.Leaders are urging calm and they're right. Yes, be cautious and protect yourself, but unless you have a compromised immunity, there isn't much to worry about."
"We are asking ourselves exactly the same question for our trip in July/August. We decided to wait and observe what will happen. We marked all the free cancellation deadlines in calendar and we follow news on our airline. If we will be eligible for refund, we will take it. Like someone earlier said, holiday is supposed to be carefree. We don't want to risk being separated from kids or stranded for weeks in a foreign country."
"""I am not worried about this virus, but that's just me. The numbers don't even come close to the number of people that have been diagnosed and died from the flu this year, but we don't see that on every front page. "" Coronavirus is NOT the flu. Talking about the number of flu deaths is a false equivalency and is highly misleading. The mortality rate for the flu is like .1% vs 3.4% for the coronavirus per the WHO. Sure that mortality rate may come down but even if it comes down to 1% it would still be ten times deadlier than the flu. To put this in context in the US out of a 1,000 people 1 person would die from the flu. If the same number of people were infected with the coronavirus 34 people would die. Kinda a big difference. In addition there are no treatments for the coronavirus. There are no vaccines for it and containment has been shown to slow the spread, which isn't possible for the flu. This doesn't mean people should panic but lets not try to compare it to the flu and act like somehow these things are similar. https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-d…Edited: 5:28 pm, March 09, 2020 "
https://www.sagaftra.org/important-coronavir… This is our union. They have cancelled their own meetings but leave it up to people like me to cancel tours. Our actors and dancers do not want to perform in these conditions.
Lest you forget we in the entertainment community have zero reason to trust the US government in managing an epidemic. We lost many thru their mismanagement of AIDS: https:/…aids-epidemic-deaths-new-york.html
""" Our actors and dancers do not want to perform in these conditions."" I don't blame them with what is going on. Heck Italy just locked down their entire country."
"I WILL be in New York from May 14 to May 20th.I live in Montreal and so far we have a few cases in the area, no deaths, it might change, hope it doesn't. But, if I were afraid, I would stop going to see my clients, stop shopping, stop going to the grocery store, and just stay in.The only reason I would not go is if my government would put New York City on a list of places not to visit in which case I would get a full refund.I was listening to the radio today and they made an important point. Montreal is thinking of cancelling the 2020 World Figure Skating Championships, however, no one is talking about cancelling any hockey game.In New York, before closing down attractions, I believe, the reasonable thing to do would be to close down the entire subway system. I doubt this will happen.See you in May New York City !"
"Well, they did cancel the Women's World Hockey Championships in Nova Scotia and might be cancelling the men's in the future. There is talk that if things get worse they could play NHL and NBA games without fans which seems bizarre (and LeBron apparently said he won't play without fans). That will be too bad if they decide to cancel the figure skating worlds."
"""In New York, before closing down attractions, I believe, the reasonable thing to do would be to close down the entire subway system."" Being that roughly 4.3 million people rely on the subway to get around and go to work or doctors or anywhere for that matter it would be absurd for them to close down subways before tourist attractions. The economic loss of closing the transit system would be tens of millions of dollars.Edited: 7:08 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Red you are absolutely right about about the economic loss of closing the transit system, but considering the how close you are to other people in the transit system during rush hour and the lack of air in there, closing a theater is a small drop in the water compared to the subway system."
"The NYC subway is not an amusement park ride and most workers don't live within walking distance of where they work - so attractions, hotels and many other places would have little or no staff(Ask anyone who was here for the 9/11 subway lockdown or the last subway strike)"
"@39 a theater is non-essential. Mass transit is very essential. In a theater people are in for a much longer duration of time compared to how long you stay on a subway. I'm not saying the subway is perfectly safe but tourist attractions are not essential. The mayor and governor have asked people not to crowd into the subway, for employers to stagger work hours, etc. Many people here don't have cars so mass transit is the only way they have to get around, including cops, fire fighters, nurses, doctors, EMS etc all use it to go to work. Its not feasible to close down the mass transit system unless we are in a dire situation. Maybe it will get to that point, but taking that action is getting near a last resort. Some of us lived through the transit strike of 2005. Even though it was only a couple of days I can tell you that it was not fun at all."
"I understand what Kaye and Red are saying, my point is that often what is locked down is less based on reason and more based on economics.It costs less and has less of an economic impact to close a theater or an attraction than it does to close something as highly required as the subway system.However, there are more people using the subway system per hour, per day, than a Broadway theater.Just my two cents."
