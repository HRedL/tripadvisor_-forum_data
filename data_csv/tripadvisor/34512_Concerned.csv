"Is anyone else concerned by the number of individuals from countries with extremely high infection rates are trying to circumvent isolation or quarantine rules for Croatia? How hard is it for people to understand that these rules are there for reason and if you are having to try think of ways around the rules, then you simply shouldnt be travelling."
"I'm actually more concerned that people from the EU are allowed to travel freely with zero testing requirements whatsoever. COVID is starting to spike again throughout the EU, and from what I have seen, large group gatherings sans masks seem every bit as prevalent in the EU as the US. They should be requiring mandatory testing for ALL arrivals."

"downinit,We from EU have certain privileges in EU country - Croatia. For example, corona impact on Latvia is ZERO compared to every other serious disease. This silly public counting of insignificant numbers have certain artificiality and rise suspicion about this affair. Anyway - better care about your own country - US!Edited: 8:44 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Agreed on the testing for all arrivals but as someone living in the EU, i can assure you it is nothing like what is going on in the US at the minute. For example, information on the below link would show you how small the EU issue is vs. the US. Also it isnt a case of everyone being able to travel freely in the EU, there are certain controls etc to manage the movement of people. https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-dâ€¦"
"Rickard123, if you really want, you can participate in this testing theatre freely. But what profit from it can be in EU countries with similar ZERO impact Including Croatia. It will just rise again lockdown hysteria, without any pragmatic reason.Edited: 8:56 am, August 07, 2020 "
But what profit from it can be in EU countries with similar ZERO impact?
To be honest i'm not really too sure what point you are trying to make aside from potentially claiming Covid is fake news. If that is your angle I'd much rather keep this thread on topic if you dont mind.
"Rikard123 - corona itself isn't ""fake news"". But many activities around corona clearly are kind of fake and suspicious.Edited: 9:24 am, August 07, 2020 "
"WLM: I have far less control and far more contempt for what happens in my own backyard than you do in yours. But this virus is world-wide, and it has been demonstrated again and again that when people start to pretend that it does not exist in an effort to resume a normal life, the virus will flare up. It only takes a few days for the number of infected people to double, which results in an exponential rise in infections. The simple act of wearing a mask and getting tested on a regular basis can have a huge impact on this pandemic. The USA has failed miserably, but the EU has also failed. Asia and Oceana are the only places to have successfully contained it, but it was only due to their ability to apply draconian measures."
"I just think anyone who is going to Croatia should behave as if they were in their own country, as Downinit says, this is a global virus and just before you fly from the UK to Croatia doesnt mean its any different. All it take are 1/2 people behaving badly to make a country flair up again, as we are seeing in Ireland."
"If it makes you feel better, not all travelers take covid lightly. We're planning to be in Croatia as a means of getting to Montenegro, but we have also been in isolation since March 16 in Nepal. Seriously, we have not left a 1km square safe-zone in five months. I'm actually blown away people are traveling for recreation. We have to for work. Not sure why so many are for fun, but that's not my place to judge."
No i have seen your posts and you seem to be one of the sensible ones! Atleast I'm not alone taking it seriously!!
My wife and I spent 84 days in a hotel in Nepal. We left the building 14 times for 45 minutes each.More people need to take it seriously.
"downinit Don't count general numbers infected, count only deaths. Latvian ~ 30 or Croatian ~ 140 isn't absolutely big numbers. And much about it is manipulation. As for example - rule of WHO that corona must be counted as cause of death even if infected with it die from other reasons. Seems that they just want numbers bigger."
"And, sorry, but I don't trust goodwill of governments, who pretend to fight against one disease, following abstract principle - what will be, if it will be, but completely don't care about others, as those ill from cancer and other serious diseases in times of corona. And appreciate every more reasonable attitude of people and governments to this problem. Without meaningless restrictions."
