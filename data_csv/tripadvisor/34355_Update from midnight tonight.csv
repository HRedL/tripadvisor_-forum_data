"From what I read they are 'poised'.Perhaps they will unpoise, but I doubt it.What about my poor taxi driver?"
"Although it’s probably true, it is saying the Govt are expected to announce...Not giving people much time if they need to be back in the U.K. by midnight tonight to avoid 14 days quarantine. They gave us 11 days notice to buy a mask to go in shops! Jules"
Time to stop all flights to Spain
was your choice to go everyone with half a brain knows the situation and this is always a risk why should you put others lives at risk

Seaside Steve I cannot understand ur comments i am a key worker working 60hrs a week I have 2 hoildays cancelled this year 1 in benidorm in 1 in mexio for my daughters weddings
This is another strategy to keep the virus suppressed in the U.K as are masks in enclosed spaces. People need to consider whether a week in the sun is worth them risking whole communities going back into lockdown.
The people who travelled only were only thinking of themselves it was a no brainer not to travel as this virus is far from over or in decline.
"People may have been booked a year ago sermac and would lose a good bit by not going probably, some may have been reluctant, those travelling in spain now deserve a bit of empathy.Atb steve"
Why they All knew the chance they took it and it has backfired.
#22 you’re a bellend Sermac. Take your negativity and get gone
Takes one to knew one. Buy if thats the best you can post funny how someone putting what is the truth upsets some tender people
sermac If you booked your holiday in 2019 how is it backfired. We live in a free society and unless the government ban people from traveling its there choice.
Exactly right it was their choice to take the chance. But it was always said that the 14 day self Isolating could be imposed.
"Peter, ‘bellend’ but harsh as they are only really stating facts. I and many others I know with property in the area have cancelled flights as the risks were/are not exactly hard to figure out. I empathise with those who took the risk in going over and who will now have to self quarantine and really hope they do actually adhere to it upon return. We were gagging to go and had the chance as soon as the flight were given the green light but we knew the risks as did everyone else."
"Let's be honest people. This country has not got the infrastructure in place to check whether people are quaranting from tomorrow. The police aren't going to check shops for people not wearing masks so what chances are there of people getting caught not quaranting. It's another knee jerk reaction from the government. No real point in people arguing on here. What will be will be. People do what people do, right or wrong."
"Sermac, how the hell did anyone who booked their holiday last year or beginning of this have any idea of the virus, quarantine or restrictions? What risk did they ignore when they knew nothing about this when they booked. You’re just being mean and insensitive.Jules"
"I must admit, we go to Benidorm every year and have done for the past 16 years. Did think about booking but had 2nd thoughts. Glad I did.Its a bit hard on the people already over in Spain, I'm sure the Government can have all the returning Holiday makers Tested, self isolate until the results. if OK continue as normal, positive isolate for 2 weeks.Anyone leaving form a certain Date have the same rules. After that date need to self isolate for 2 weeks on return.there got to be some sort of compromise."
Let’s just hope that people returning use common sense.
Sermac the virus was never spoke of in 2019 so how come they took a chance
"Sermac,the coronavirus only started in Jan/Feb this year,how could you predict that.If you booked a holiday before jan this year,you have been very unfortunate.So nobody knew what they were getting into at all."
We cancelled our holiday as that we booked in September last year because well before the lockdown we saw the situation in Europe and decided that it would not be clear by this time.
You’re lucky you were allowed to sermac. Some people have had to sit it out and hope holidays would go ahead because they couldn’t get refunds under the changing Govt. guidance. You didn’t know how this virus would play out before March. Nobody did! Why do you take pleasure in the misfortune of others?Jules
Pure and simple the government had given the green light for everyone to travel to Spain only a matter of weeks ago with no restrictions to boast the economy. Anyone not being able to self isolate for 14 days should be given their money back full stop. A massive blow to the travel industry as now no one will book to go on holiday. Be an uproar over this. The people who lifted the travel ban should be sacked and put in court.

"Sorry everyone had the choice 12 weeks prior to travel and only lose the deposit which is what we did. Maybe that is hind sight on our behalf, but we had an excellent Travel Agent who was 100% correct to advise us against paying the holiday in full as has played out by so many people who are fighting to get refunds."
Well said
holiday or health. NO BRAINER
"Simon, how can say this ‘ sack those responsible’ ,,, really. Please oh please correct me if I am wrong but this thing is still a moving target right ? So when case where coming down would you if agreed with still keeping the economy in limbo? I was and still am a great believer that in this moment in time you pay your money and take your chances. After as you know after battling for various refunds over the last 4 months I really do as stated before emphasis with those with holidays booked with little or no chance of refunds, but really ‘everyone should get a full refund’ slightly goes against your principles over last few months( remember we should all be taking TUI vouchers to save the company) . And as for sacking people ,, really ,, I mean really,, I wish I had a bucket full of hindsight, these people are trying to make informed decisions on data."
"I really do think we need to Both protect the UK population and the returning British people. Forget weather it was right or wrong to go to Spain. I'm sure 99% of returning people from Spain, would want to be tested. If as a country we can build Hospitals in a week, it would not be a problem to set up a testing Station at all Airports, Stations and Ports for a week and test everyone returning to the UK. We now have to Protect ALL UK population.."
"Mark, great response and 100% agreed pure and simple."
"Protect from what?In January 2018 Seasonal flu killed 65 thousands people in UK only, at tje time, news hedalines were calling it 'killer flu' and were explaining it is down to 42% increase in death rate due to flu.65 thousands in UK in one month two years ago.Now, 10 month into so called global pandemic and we have 45 thousands deaths...and lockdowns that will potentially bring about 200 thousands deaths according to official government's report, milions of unemployed, ruined lifes, sky rocketing suicides, freedoms stripped step by step while governments powers are rising over night, frightened societies, divoded more from day to day and everyone blackmailed by Bill Gates and cooperating governments and supporting mainstream media into accepting round cycle of vaccinetions and 'eventaully' microchipped from the same gay that says there is no going back to normality untill we all do what told by him.How about, a global madness where humanity is being dissmanteled by powers at be, by using psychological element of most powerfull emotion which is fear in order to get the Agenda pushed.Unbolievable."
"Funnily enough simon you never voiced any concerns when the travel ban was lifted, now you want people jailed.To be fair you sounded pleased about it.Atb steve"
Post 42 holiday or health. NO BRAINER - absolutely agree. Now they are going to justify bending the rules and not self isolating which will put all of us at risk just because they needed a holiday .
"A sunday times reporter decided to twitter an unsubstanciated report that this would happen .No comment from HMG ,then the guardian and telegraph picked it up so ms sturgeon knee jerked and said all returns to scotland will 14 day quarantine from midnight.The fco and uk gov website still says no quaratine as of ten minutes ago ,so a reporter has caused chaos and a scottish panic merchant has knee jerked to it .We fly Sunday and have signed upto uk.gov email updates and at minute NO Quarantine but if bojo panics this could change .Bleddy reporters lying has caused this"
3 holidays down the pan and it looks lick holiday at xmas to goa down the pan. but we are still in very good health.money is nothing your health comes 1st
Norwich happy days it is a total joke for the government to tell people to go and book for Spain families spending thousands of pounds then three weeks later they call it off. The people who made the decision should be sacked and in court if they do not reimburse every penny after the government had given the green light. The public will never trust them again total fools.
"""Government data shows 64,157 people died in January - the highest since 2006""Wake up people, open your eyes, agenda is being pushed.Please confront 65000 that died of flu in UK in one month of January 2018 to 45000 dying fo so called 'covid 19' 10 months into global 'pandemic' and look at the results and find out who is benefitting out of this.It os global madnes where people's cpmmon sense is being hijacked by msm fear narrative."
Why are you trying to ridicule me as 'flat earther'.Please concentrate at the figure i presented and turn your thinking as you are just folower.
"Post 46, I hear these arguments every day in the industry that I work in and quite frankly they get very tiresome. This virus is something that was an unknown, as never seen before so protection caution is surely better than initial blind ignorance, right?"
"yeah he.s done it ,quarantine from midnight official gov website says dont cut short your holiday but you will have to stay home 14 days on your return"
"Not only that, they are making sure by anouncing this over the weekend that they will increase this number of affected people if they would choose to anounce it during a working week.They need 'more' cases.Autumn is comming in and they are desperate for second wave."
It’s because I am an independent thinker that I won’t buy into your paranoia Puracielo.Jules
I m sorry but that is incorrect.The virus has been known for a long time.Ask yourself a quaestion why PCR test are 80% false positive.Reason being it is becouse this test developed in 1984 is designed to detect any antibodies that correspond with any coronavirus type and there is whole family of viruses belonging to a family of corona that are responsible for common cold or flu.That is why more tests translate to more cases.Once you had a flu you likely have remaining antibodies that corresponds to wide spectrum of coronaviruses.Creator of this tests said that himself.
"#53 Fake News. About 20 000a year die from flu every year in uk. 28,000 in one year recently. The 65000 in one month is so fake.45000 died from covid in UK ie tested positive for it.65000 excess deaths will include cancer, heart attacks etc as all focus on covid. Plus suicides."
"I say fine, you call it paranoia, but Bill Gates is invested in every aspect of this pandemic including milions for bbc or royal colege of london where computer models came out from the same gay that was known for projecting with his very very wrong predictions many times before, at the same time many, many epidemiologist, virologist, doctors, jurnalists and even poloticians are publically warning there is an agenda being pushed and there is no pandemic.While calling me paranaoid you still didn't say what you think about 65 thousand flu death in january 18 compared to 45 thoisands deaths of 10 months global pandemic and all realted to them absurdities.Maybe, i'm not paranoid but well researched and you are just ignorant?"
"Puracielo, Any chance you can tell me what you are on, May need to ttake some myself. Not sure about you, but I'm living in the real world."
"Fake news, rally?https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.c…"

I’m afraid quoting scientific ‘facts’ from the Daily Mail is as reliable as your spelling Puracielo.Jules
"Sorry, should be 'same guy'."
"Puracielo, really!!!!! The Daily Mail!!!!!!"
"Puracielo, if you are over 50 or Under 10, you will be able to get the Flu Jab this year, so you should be OK in the coming winter months. Just be careful you don't get the Virus,"

"#67 what is the reasoning Jules for publicising artificially high deaths relating to covid 19?, ie: it appears no one can ever recover from this virus, test positive 3 months ago and be asymptomatic, run over by a bus today, and on your death cert as a cause of death covid??. Do you not think that in itself is pretty strange?. My pal had a massive heart attack 6 weeks ago,taken to our local hospital, obviously tested as a precautionary measure, test showed he was positive, he was asymptomatic, he sadly died 2 days later, his family are up in arms against the decision to put covid 19 as a cause of death on his cert Frankly, disgusting!."
"I love people in general, so i care.I would like to see all people waking up to what is really happening but i'm not naive.You don't want to see the kingdom that is now slowly apearing.Global digital concentration camp for those that will be strongest for those that are not, well, have a look at what Bill Gates said at Ted Talks in 2015 how humanity is a virus and threat to earth by being couse of global warming and how reducing global numbers with parental control and 'vaccination' is going to help long term.Official video of him talking to an audience about it is on youtube.Instead of next pint, mayne research what is really happening before it will be to late for you and your loved ones.You have choice to open your eyes.Goodluck"
"Puracielo,You do know its a travel forum don't you?"
Meanwhile in Benidorm there’s people wondering how they’ll convince their employers to let them take another 2 weeks off! Jules
"Foreign office have advised against all non essential travel to mainland Spain so people that have booked will get refunded:25 July 2020Latest update:Update to advise against all non-essential travel to mainland Spain ('Summary').From 26 July, the FCO advises against all non-essential travel to mainland Spain based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. Only the Canary Islands (Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro and La Graciosa) and Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera) are exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel.This advice is based on evidence of increases in cases of COVID-19 in several regions, but particularly in Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia (which include the cities of Zaragoza, Pamplona and Barcelona).The FCO is not advising those already travelling in Spain to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. If you are returning from Spain (including from the Balearics and Canaries) on or after 26 July you will be required to quarantine on your return to the UK, but the FCO is not advising you to cut short your visit. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.Edited: 4:12 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Hi benissteve, He has been on other Forums, saying the same things. I think it would best to ignore him. Lets hope the UK Government can get all the holiday makers back from Spain and keep all safe and healthy."
Has TA transformed itself into a Dadaist experimentalist forum? I’m all for it but it has taken me by surprise. I’m going to drink some wine now.
"#74 have seen many a video of Mr and Mrs Gates, alarming is a understatement."
"I know, i travel myself too.What's your point?When countless people are repeating mainstream media and government's narrative how we have to be safe and how we have to control and how we should encourage everyone to subjugate to more and more oppresive mesures under an excuse of pandemic it is all nice and dandy, bit the minute someone is critically thinking for himself and excersising his freedom of speech to express counter opinion to mainstream, he is immidetally asked to turn of without even checking evidences that person presents.Globe of followers and somehow everyrhing is going down, and it shouldn't as most are obidient good citizens, isn't it?"
"Jules, tbh you have to be sensible about this as an employer. I feel most will say unfortunately that you knew the Risk 2 weeks unpaid or take remaining holiday. Harsh reality."
"I’ve no doubt many will Happydays and this has been very hard on businesses too.Puracielo, I’ve no doubt you’re a very well meaning man but this is a travel forum not Speaker’s Corner in Hyde Park. Many of us understand these issues much better than you give us credit for but this isn’t the time or place to discuss them. Jules"
"I doubt you understand what is happening right now, and travel will not be a problem soon, people will be faced with unprecendented enslavement.But hey, i get this is not important when someoneis saying different to what everyone is used to on daily basis from msm.Best Regards,"

"Hi Tinto66, its no different than getting tested in England now. They say if you think you have symptoms, get tested and isolate. There could be lots of things you can get and have the same symptoms. My Mum was taken into Hospital in April (80 years Old) with all the symptoms of the Virus. It turn out she had pneumonia. It was a week of hell for me. All i can say, the Government have let down a lot of people with there actions. But there again they are always criticise for being to late to take action."

The only issue that may arise is that whilst the Balerics and Canaries are currently low. They have had a lot of holiday makers from mainland Spain arriving as they have 2nd homes on the islands. So I would expect the figuresvto rise there as well.
Simon EasyJet holidays have cancelled all holidays based on gov advice and isolation rule (they’d always said they would cancel if forced to isolate either side)Just got emailNo idea if flight only but likely too due to low numbers by default
My mates going in morning and flight still on as far as they know. Also Ryanair running and B.A. to Spain.However Easy Jet have now offered the chance to move flights to a later date. People will not get money back for hotels booked as they are still open unless they are covered by there insurance.
"I've posted this before but here goes again, surgical masks or home made ones do FA to protect you from the virus, or any virus, cold, flu whatever, nor do they protect somebody else from you. They are not designed for that purpose. I am a medical professional and wear one 8 hours day every day in a hospital.Sweden, no masks = virus practically gone. Spain, muzzzled up = problem. It's not about masks!I feel so sorry for the people affected by this new ruling, I don't think this government or the opposition are fit for purpose.Edited: 7:20 pm, July 25, 2020 "
Bobby Sweden population 10 million Spain 46 million Almost exactly same size geographical area You can not compare in any way!
And there is still a poster (or poser) on here who thinks it's all blown out of proportion because the virus doesn't kill enough people to show such concern!! Some posters live in a different world. I really hope those who have booked holidays can enjoy what is on offer here in Benidorm. Steve
"Well Bobby,what are the masks designed for?."
"Really? What about us who paid for the holiday before this hit Britain? We have no choice but to go. If we cancelled, we would get no holiday or refund. Nobody saw this coming. Get a grip before you start slating people. I’m sick of people sat online, dictating to people without any knowledge or reason."

"Good Morning Folks,,, just to add my tuppence worth to the mass debate ;-) I booked a quick break when the restrictions were relaxed,, was due to go to Benidorm on 14th August,, that looks like a non starter now,,, I knew the risks and I took my chance,,, I have been living in this big smart prison for long enough and wanted to fell some ""normality"" I accept that I will probably lose most of the money I spent to book as I booked flights and hotel separate.now I see people who have all of a sudden become experts in epidemiology and the spread of the virus,, and even the powers that be keep telling US that they are following the science,, well why don't they actually follow the scientific stats and data,, would that not be better? we seem to be completely focussed on the ""R"" rate,, this is the Rate of Infection,, why don't we focus on the ""CFR"" rate ,, this is rate of mortality i.e the rate of death (Morbid I know but very important), if we look at the ""Real data"" from the worldometer and also the actual practice of testing etc,, then we should get a ""Real"" idea of what is actually taking place.So lets look at Spain on the worldometer : https:/…and now in more detail (its in Spanish) : https:/…Actualizacion_170_COVID-19.pdfNow lets look at the testing processes that determine what the ""R""rate is and how they test : https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/how-is-…please note that probably all of Europe use the ""PCR"" test and NOT the ""RT-PCR"" test.now a word on the ""PCR"" test from Thursday past 23rd July,,, there was a supposed outbreak at one of Scotlands football teams - St Mirren FC where they said that there were 7 staff tested positive for Covid,, only for it to be corrected as a ""False Positive"" this was done by ""PCR"" testing; https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/inte…Now I actually follow the actual stats and data by the worldometers etc and NOT from the W.H.O who lets face it are not exactly being truthful.make of it what you want but I know what data I believe and I compare to other years so I have my own conclusions which I keep to myself as I know the earth is actually a sphere ;-)Cheers and happy reading ;-) Wullie"
