I am thinking of visiting DC in October. Do you think crowds will be different because of the November election?
"No, you wouldn’t even see a difference on Election Day. The inauguration would be different, but not until a few days before."
No there's never any extra crowds due to election day or campaigning. The Marine Corps Marathon is a bigger thing to watch out for.
Thank you for the feedback. :-)
"The last place candidates go it is the Washington Metro area; we are all too enmeshed in politics all year long to be persuaded. Anywhere in the country, the only thing you will see different on Election is that schools are closed (usually) and cars are parked near them. That's it.In October, unless you happen to be near a speech being given, nothing is different. And near us, no condidates need to waste their time giving speeches, as I said.In fact, October is a great time to visit, no school groups, great weather, European and East Asian couples seem to be more prevalent than the rest of the year."
"Campaigning is done elsewhere, and elections are local, obviously. I can't think of any reason why crowds would be bigger in DC because of a national election. Even the candidates probably won't be here, they are always in their ""home state"". Except maybe the Pres as he lives here now, so I suppose he'll be here. Reporters are generally at their stations in NY."
"“ Except maybe the Pres as he lives here now, so I suppose he'll be here”His official residence is in Palm Beach, Florida. He’ll likely be there."
I would be more concerned about coronavirus and flying.
