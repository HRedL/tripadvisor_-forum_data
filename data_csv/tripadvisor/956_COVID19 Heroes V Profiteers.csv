"Hi allI added a post to the Causes Forum (https:/…106215038) encouraging people to post reviews in TA to highlight those operators who have responded to their clients, in these difficult and extraordinary times, positively (COVID-19 Heroes) or negatively (COVID-19 Profiteer). I have seen a lot of posts in the German BookingCom community forums from people who have been refused to be allowed to cancel without penalty, a 'non refundable' booking - despite the fact that they have not been able to get to the hotel due to travel bans in their country. I have suggested that if they exhaust all options and eventually lose their money, they should lodge a 'COVID-19 Profiteer' review here in TA. On the other hand, those who have reprted that they received a favourable outcome from the hotel, I have encouraged to lodge a 'COVID-19 Hero' review - as I have done for the Millennium Airport Hotel Dubai (https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserRevie…).I would encourage all TA-ers to do the same - especially the COVID-19 heroes - these establishments deserve to be highlighted so they can benefit from their generosity when things eventually turn around.CheersMark"
"I don't think this is the time to denounce anyone as ""profiteer"" who under circumstances beyond anybody's control is unable to change the conditions of a contract both sides agreed on. Individual countries put different restrictions in place at different times, even differing from region to region. What already was a case of Force Majeur in one place was a whole different story in another, hence different compensation obligations kicked in at different times and places. E.g. shall an Italian hotel refund money to an American customer who chose to cancel a trip as his government put out travel warnings that at the time were in no accordance with those of international organizations? Imho the situation is too complicated to draw a black-and-white picture with profiteers on one and heroes on the other side. Yes, do highlight exceptional customer service, but don't condemn those that stick to playing by the rules. Looking at your original post you seem to be bringing up this topic due to a trip you have planned for next September. Seriously? The industry is working the pile of canceled Easter vacations right now. There are no travel restrictions in place for September yet, so there is no case of Force Majeure, no legal ground to work on for September. Travelers need to be patient and flexible this year. After all, we are in the privileged situation that we can still occupy our minds with such pleasures.Edited: 2:13 am, April 02, 2020 "
"@A Mainzer Goes Places ... actually if you had read my original post properly, you would have seen that the reason for our coming to Germany in September was to attend the Passion Play in Oberammergau ... it's already been cancelled until 2022 and for that reason our holiday has been cancelled. So we are now going through the process of cancelling our arrangements to give every establishment plenty of notice - and a vast majority of providers, even those with whom we had a 'no cancellation' booking, have already been happy to give us a refund under these extraordinary circumstancesAs for now is not the time ... I am reading many posts on BookingCom forums of people who are having to cancel bookings now for accommodation in the next week or so and are being refused refunds. It's those people I'm advising to call-out these profiteers. When an agreement is struck between parties and there is an occurrence which prevents the arrangement going ahead, it's fair to expect some leniency on the terms and an act of good will by the provider - particularly as many peolple's livelihoods have been impacted for who knows how long through no fault of anyone but fate.But, I guess we will have to agree to disagree"
"""it's fair to expect some leniency on the terms and an act of good will by the provider - particularly as many peolple's livelihoods have been impacted for who knows how long through no fault of anyone but fate.""I am completely with a Mainzer here. Your contract has a certain risk distribution - if you booked a more expensive rate, the cancellation risk is on the hotel's side, otherwise, it is on your side. If the hotel cannot keep up its side of the bargain, then sure, you should be refunded.It is great if a hotel still lets you cancel even when it is not obliged to. But you seem to assume that all hotels are run by billionaires who are not affected by the crisis. Instead, many small hotels will be close to bankruptcy this summer. The lives of the hotel staff and management have been affected as much as ours, perhaps more. Why do you expect them to be lenient, while you are not willing to be lenient yourself? It is quite possible that the crisis will be under control in September. If the hotel is still there by that time, I am sure there are other things to see in the area..."
"@GermanSW1. The hotel to which I referred is part of a multi-national chain - so no, it's not a stuggling family-run business2. A number of the establishments which have provided refunds are (probably struggling) small businesses (perhaps they understand the concept of 'we are all in this together and hopefully we will all make it through together' - or is that just how it works in Australia) - and I would be far more understanding of small business than a huge multi-national3. Refer 2 and take a peek just under my name on the left hand side ... sure we'll just pop over for the weekend in September to check out a couple of sites, then come back in 2022 for the Passion Play.4. The purpose of my original post was to encourage others who feel similarly aggrieved to register their displeasure - not to try to get sympathy for my situation (I can fight my own battles) or convince people like you and Mainzer... again let's agree to disareeEdited: 4:45 am, April 02, 2020 "
