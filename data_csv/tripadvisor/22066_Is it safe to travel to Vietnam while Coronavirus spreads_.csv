"Hello,I have already purchased flights to Vietnam in 6/2, do I have to be concerned about getting infected by the Coronavirus? What are the odds? How safe Vietnam is in this period?"
Already plenty of threadshttps:/â€¦105197625We don't need another one.
"Odds are good at the moment that you should be okay, especially if you are in good health and not elderly. Consult your bookmaker for changes in the odds."
Asking health advice on a travel forum is stupid and dumb! Ask the health authorities of your Government
Not sure rudeness is called for.
"Topic 84 about Coronavirus , unbelievable ...."
"There have been a lot more threads on the Thailand TA forum than on here, however that forum attracts a lot more trolls and idiots unfortunately.The OP needs to read what has already been posted on here and then seek professional medical advice before travelling"
What is it with #4 being so snarky with postings? Didn't your mother ever tell you that if you can't say anything nice then don't say anything at all. Lots of people have never been to Southeast Asia and have realistic concerns with the current situation and are searching for information (not snide remarks) If you are traveling to Asia you need to make realistic informed decisions based on the information available. TA is a good source to start with and then continue to monitor the crisis in China through other sources. If you are tired of the same questions then stop reading them. Meanwhile maybe you should keep your snarky answers to yourself.
Sorry that is poster #3 not poster #4.
"jason1010Maybe it's because the entire front page is taken up by the same question after question and those that regularly give their time to help people, can get fed up with it. When its something as serious as this you should be taking advice from the correct government department of your country not a forum where everyone has different opinions. Snarky ...maybeFed up ...yes.."
The virus is there. Why would you want to take the risk.
There are cases in USA so why would you want to go there ?Ross
"Now it is Ok but they check virus pretty tight . No much fun now. In june, nobody knows how th situation overthere will be . Just hang tight and see how corona situation develop over there before u travel . Good Luck."
"Is it safe to travel to Vietnam while Coronavirus spreads? =====================================If it was still spreading , would you want to go?"
"From all reports on this site everything appears normal, albeit, a smaller band of tourists. It must be kept in mind though that this site is infected with many false poster/vested interestsYour own Government is best placed to answer your concerns.Cheers Ross."
Check news updates. It's no longer spreading in VN.
No worries here now. Compared to other countries Vietnam is doing quiet well.
"The latest numbers for Vietnam : all 16 confirmed cases have fully recovered with 0 fatalities. So right now, at least officially, Vietnam has no confirmed active cases of Covid 19."
"Newspaper Courrier du Vietnam of 28 February (my translation) :The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) has decided to remove Vietnam from its list of countries presenting a risk, saluting the efficient fight of the country against the epidemic of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)."
