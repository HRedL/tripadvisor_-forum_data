Making my trip officially cancelled.
"CDC still says Alert Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) for Japan. I don't know where you are from, but don't go to the US, either. There are more deaths there than in Japan. The CDC has no alert level for the US. Hmmmm.....Hope you will try to come to Japan again!"
"Igor, do you have a link to information about the level being raised? I just checked US State Department's website and Japan is still level 2. Would appreciate any other info. Thanks."
"CDC in the U.S.A. included China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea, but did not include Japan, in its Level 3 Travel Heath Notice, as follows. https:/…faqs.html"
"So..... I went to the ""US Travel Advisory."" And this is what I got. Looks like the State Department is pretty confused. https:/…Igor, do you have a link to where you found your information?"
https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…Looks like it’s a GLOBAL travel advisory and not only for Japan. Making things even more confusing. My flight is tonight and I’m overwhelmed with stress figuring out what to do.
"Folks, Igor is referring to the US State Department, not the CDC. They are different entities with different scales for travel warnings (1-3 for CDC and 1-4 for State Department).Of course you are all correct that the CDC still lists Japan as a level 2.However, the State Department issued a GLOBAL level 3 alert (meaning to reconsider travel). As it is global, it does not just include Japan. No need for ""hmms"" it is not a conspiracy or intentionally singnaling out one country.Of course the situation here in the States seems to be getting worse as well. But I don't think the CDC issues travel warning for itself lol. It is to advise US citizens traveling abroad.Here is the link to the State Department warning: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…Here is the short summary from their twitter: ""Global Health Advisory: Reconsider travel abroad due to global impact of COVID-19. Many areas worldwide are now taking actions including quarantines and border restrictions. Even areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice.""Given the rapidly changing situation all across the globe, it does seem kind of prudent to not travel right now if you don't have to IMO."
"We need to fight this pandemic together, and each of us has to do his/her part. We should cancel or postpone all nonessential travel for now."
I agree! Seasons will continue to come and go . . .
Alright so I’m boarding now. Spent the whole day contemplating. The wife and i decided to just do it. I will see you tomorrow Tokyo!
