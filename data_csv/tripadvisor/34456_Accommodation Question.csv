"Hello. As a regular visitor to Croatia I have been viewing this forum with keen interest. Thank you to all those elucidating the constantly changing rules with regards covid 19 and access to Croatia.I am flying out on July 06th from Luton to Split with Wizzair for the purposes of a holiday.If I understand correctly I will need to provide proof of accommodation booked for the duration of my stay.Does this mean I have to stay in the same accommodation for the duration, for example 2 weeks in Split, or am I allowed to locate in various places, for instance 3 days Split, 2 days Makarska, 2 days Omis etc? Would a print out from booking.com be sufficient evidence? Also, can I just book my outward journey and only arrange my return flight until during my vacation under current guidance?Many thanks in anticipation if your responses.GarethEdited: 4:39 am, June 13, 2020 "
