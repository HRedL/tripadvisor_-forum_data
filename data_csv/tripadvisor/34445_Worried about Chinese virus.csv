"We’re due to travel to Outrigger in a couple of weeks. With the high percentage of Chinese guests, we’re a little concerned at the risk of the new Chinese virus. Anyone else concerned?"
You will probably find that you are scanned as you enter immigration anyone showing signs of a temperature will be pulled out of line.
"Also the chances of there being someone contagious with that particular virus on a tiny dot of an island like OK are minuscule. The international plane would be a marginally greater concern IMO, but still a small one, especially, for example, on a direct flight from the UK. I guess your domestic transfer is the bigger plane risk.I think it’s a fair question. Personally, at this stage, I’m not worried - about the virus or my forthcoming holiday."
"We are flying out to Male tomorrow, just after Chinese New Year. I am a nurse and not the least bit worried about the Corona virus. The Chinese habitually spit in the street which rapidly pass on any bugs to all and sundry, which is probably why these viruses spread so quickly in China. Remember SARS? Most paper/cotton masks last about three minutes.To be proportionate, up to 10,000 people in the UK die of ‘flu every year, more when there is a rise in cases world wide or an epidemic. Malaria kills a million people worldwide every year. Those who have died are either immunocompromised or have co morbidities, which means their immune system is weakened. Most of those who are healthy and have contracted this virus have had a very mild illness, a bit like a nasty cold. Rules:Don’t worry.Wash your hands regularly. Take wet wipes/hand gel with you and use them. Don’t worry. Wash your hands regularly. Enjoy your holiday."
"There are reports online from several news agencies that the Ministry of Tourism in The Maldives introduced health screening at Velana Airport last Wednesday, and have since installed a thermal camera at the immigration desk to vet all travellers for the virus.Cheers ❤️"
"I was living in Taiwan during the SARS out break there. Many people there did die from it. Some nurses in the hospital in our city did die after being infected by the patients who had it. The biggest hospital in our city ended up completely isolating 3 floors of the hospital with all the staff not allowed to leave until they were cleared. It was tough to watch on TV. Most large outdoor activities were cancelled, everyone got scanned either by hand thermometers before they could enter shops, banks and the like. I was volunteering as an entertainer at another large hospital and they had the big thermal thermometers set up as you walked in. My oldest son took a trip to HK for a visa and as it had many cases, when he returned had to stay indoors at his apartment for 10 days in case he got infected there. They came and checked that he was at home twice a day. I'm hoping things will get under control, as hopefully I may be heading back to the Maldives later in the year. It will probably one take one infection there and the government may take drastic moves to shut things down. I hope not."
"Hi Wirralite, thermal screening doesn’t pick up this virus, it just indicates if someone has a raised temperature, which could be caused by a number of things. Additionally, the incubation period for this virus is 14 days, that’s the length of time a person carries the virus, and can spread it, before they have any symptoms. I’m at LHR waiting to fly to Male and am not one bit worried about it, even though have seen several Chines people in the airport wearing masks."

"I'm just going to add that IMO planes are horrifyingly unpleasant. I am one of those germaphobes who sanitises the surfaces around me. Mostly because I don't want any kind of vomiting disease. Keeping hands clean and not touching the face helps keep illness at bay...don't forget the acronym, folks, and clean your Table, Window, Armrest, TV, Seatbelt before you touch anything... :D"
"Deleted and reposted to amend something...A lovely forum member just posted WHO guidance elsewhere. This is the link https:/… (thanks and hope you don't mind me taking it!)Of interest regarding temp scanning on entry, it says, 'Evidence shows that temperature screening to detect potential suspect cases at entry may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel and may require substantial investments. However, during the current outbreak with the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, the majority of exported cases were detected through entry screening. The risk of importation of the disease may be reduced if temperature screening at entry is associated with early detection of symptomatic passengers and their referral for medical follow up.'I guess I would say (again) that I am not particularly worried about this, just like I am not particularly worried about terrorism in the Maldives...but that doesn't mean that I think risk doesn't exist - as it most certainly does. But there are risks everywhere you (I) turn, and it's all a matter of balance and remaining informed in order to be able to make balanced decisions and decided whether - or not - to worry, especially in a constantly changing situation. I therefore think this is a useful thread."
"@MalDiva here here, 100% in agreement with you!@Kim thanks for the perspective, and have a fab holiday"
"I hadn’t intended to give a medical opinion, and I’m certainly not qualified to do so.I only thought it might be helpful for the OP to report the article I’d read, confirming that the Maldivian authorities appear to be reacting to the situation in a similar way to many other countries with regard to traveller health screening at airports. I can’t comment if it’s effective or not.But I agree that it’s wise to practice all the personal precautions suggested above, and enjoy your holiday!Safe travels, everyone.Cheers ❤️"
let me clarify this. its not the Chinese spitting which is the problem. living in uk for ten years， I saw just as much pissing and spitting public.its the coughing sneezing which are the problems. its transmitted that。way and it has a long incubation period and signs are not obvious. its very funny you emphasize Chinese spitting which you are in a country where spitting is standard. being a nurse shouldnt you behave more professionaly？ with regards on how it transmit. I happened to know the uk health system， its just so bad， I asked for a private clinic once， the GP cant even figure out one， ppl with cancer has to wait for bed for half a year.dont look at ppl in china town as representation. back 15 years， UK is advanced， but now？ I used to look at 300k pound house with wow， now it can barely buy my toilet
the bottom line is ， its hard to detect and there is always a chance like plane crush. yes the safest way is to exclude Chinese guests for sure. but would they for the money reasonI dont see point why the stupid person who claim herself to a professional nurse emphasis street spitting habbits when professionally its totally irrelevant. is my comment on this matter professional？ lets just say my mum has a stake in the biggest private hospital in beijing with a thousand bedsI dont want to be rude， if you talk crap and arrogance， you make me have to get back to you the same way
"@Wirralite, well WHO seem to think it's largely effective...and that's good enough for me :)"
Thank you all for your replies and suggestions. We’re not due to travel until Feb. 12th so we’ll watch how this develops.
mid feb is the expected big fallout period since everyone is returning back from home， with airlines and high speed railway net work all over， transmission is expect to peak. all the maldives agency are taking a big hit because the government granted free cancellation on trips and many are canceling out of fear. according to news a some planes have found infected ppl and then the whole plane got tracked down ， and the passengers along with anyone in contact with got quarantined， so there will very likely to have a case in the maldives. if you are old and very worried， its better to postpone your trip. its no doult a big inconvenience for everyone. the chances shouldnt be high because you need to be in close proximity to get infected， its common sense you see someone sick you get away.
"Sheila, keep popping back. I would imagine that this post might remain updated for a while.Hopefully we will all be able to move forward taking care not to offend each other."
the offending is obviously intentional. when ppl tot of the uk， the first word would be gentleman. after 10 years living there I realize gentleman is more about sugar coating than what it literal means. you dont like Chinese thats fine but not fine speaking publicly . you want to be a lady which looks good on you for your own sake in your culturewhen uk news pop up at home， some are very interesting things like mid aged woman sleep with underaged boys ，which has never been reported in china. would I generalize and call British perverts？ hell no ！ there are so many good ppl out there， my brain would be so fxxked up to ignore the truth and speak recklessly. but if you allow me to speak my mind for once， I dont understand where the arrogance come from， a country with no growth， near 0 interest rates， no comparative advantage in anyway.
"Personally I think this topic should now be closed. It has, unfortunately, taken a ridiculous turn and will now be of no further help to anyone."
@MalDivanot you， look at what the nurse said.I think many of the brits here are nice， I dont want to offend but there leaves me no alternative. why should I be exploitated my right to defend and argue？ why should I stay silent in the light of the Chinese spitting infection bull S
Can I please suggest that we keep this thread strictly on topic..... it's coming pretty close to breaking rules of the forum in my opinion. Let's keep it factual and helpful please. I understand that feelings are running high for some members here but the language and messages are going to far off topic to be relevant now.
"LindyLouisa, TBH I understand the reason that offence was taken, but agree that retaliation isn't helping. Posts on both sides are gone (mostly). Hopefully it will settle and the thread will be useful. IMO it's a subject that is going to keep being raised for a while, and it is helpful to have a single thread that people can add to and refer to."

"Oh dear. I’m sorry this query has caused bad feelings. Come on guys, this forum has always been about sharing help and experience."
"Now the thread looks like a patchwork quilt! However, I am sure there will be further thoughts and information as the situation changes..."
"Firstly having been to Konotta twice I can confirm that it’s one of the islands with very high percentile of Chinese clients. Whether they had caught coronavirus and spread it around the island — no idea here.Secondly to ease your mind the Chinese authority has seized ALL international tour groups since today. No Chinese toirist allowed to leave the country should they booked the ‘ flight + hotel’ package through a travel agent. This is one of the biggest lost the poor tourists and country will have to face due to during spring festival it’s possibly the highest price : room for Chinese market of the whole year— no one knows if the hotels in Maldives will help to rebook the dates of Chinese guests who had bookings through travel agents, or just happily argue it’s within 7 days notice so it’s happy and easy money for the hotel. Many Chinese tourists were really upset about this lost — they only know they were banned from the travel but no idea any compensation will be offered. No one knows really and looking at the price of their package, it will be at least 5k pounds for each family in general. But there will be so many of them during Chinese Spring Festival, and remember this is a lost for all Chinese groups travelling to any country in the world. Plus none groups decided to book ‘ flight + hotel’ through agents.I know there will be different voice about this ban, but please keep in mind, this action shows how much the Chinese gov wants to stop the virus to spread to the world. This ban is not only limited to Maldives but to the whole world! The Chinese gov has announced this on 25 jan, less than a week’s time of confirming the danger of the spread within China. Personally I think it’s for the sake of helping other countries not catching the outbreak and I DON’T think any other country will take the same action when you think of how fully occupied by Chinese tourists each hotel in Maldives during spring festival and how many healthy families had to lost their money because of the minority’s infection. By the way given that time and time again I saw here on the forum and in real life people has absolutely no idea where an Asian come from but decided that they are ‘ Chinese’, I would like to mention that when you see an Asia face in Maldives they can also be from Japan, Korea, Thai, Lao, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore,Indonesian, Phillipines, etc etc ( I really had enough of people from the west just randomly accused an Asia did sth. Bad and the Asian very clearly not even speaking Chinese or type Chinese on YouTube but they are designated as ‘ Chinese’ .On thé side note I admitted that I once stalked the blog ( not anymore) from an earlier poster from Bei Jing here and yes, the house and car he has can easily be one of the most expensive of all forum regulars... not saying those barbarians only has money but no manner, but I too do not understand why accusing Chinese did all wrong doing in fact was done by other nations in Maldives making some people here feeling so great.. sad... we embrace the world by going to the other end, through working, living and knowing it better but some others decided to never travel to the place they kept accusing but believe they know everything already...Edited: 11:20 pm, January 27, 2020 "
More name calling and personal attacks?
Hi SheilaI'm due to be at OK on the 12th too. Of course I'm a bit worried but with all the things that go on in the world we'd never leave the house! so hopefully will see you there. So looking forward to it.
"We are in the Maldives now. Flew via Columbo. Some of the flight attendants were wearing masks when we joined the aircraft in London. All the staff at Colombo airport and Male airport were wearing masks, some were wearing surgical gloves. Many passengers were wearing masks at Colombo and Male airport. Additionally, at both airports there were cameras screening all passengers as they walked past, presume they were for thermal imaging - to identify anyone who had a temperature. There were large notices in Male airport ‘Polite notice to our visitors from China.’ All in Chinese, so can’t be certain what they were about. This virus has an incubation period of 14 days, so someone can be carrying it for that length of time and potentially infecting others, before symptoms show, this makes thermal imaging cameras useless in a lot of cases. The best way to help prevent any virus spreading is to cough or sneeze into a tissue, dispose of it and wash hands.Wash hands regularly, particularly before eating and after being in a public place.Most paper/cotton masks - the type commonly seen in hospitals and now it seems, airports, are only effective as a respiratory barrier for a few minutes, but what they do is prevent people keep touching their nose and mouth, then touching other surfaces and spreading and bacteria/viruses. As said before, this virus currently causes mild symptoms in healthy people. It’s the elderly, immunocompromised or those with comorbidities - long term chronic illnesses that are most at risk of becoming very unwell if infected."
I will make an update for the situation in China. only wuhan and hubei province is bad hit， seriously bad hit. most cases are from there and under reporting is likely due to the way how identification works compounding with the fact that because the symptom is so similar to common old，people got scared and rushed to hospital and there is simply not enough test boxes for all those people， and in the mean time the real infected start to infect the surroundingsthe good news is huhan is totally locked down. incubation period is 14 days tops and its already been like almost a week since lock down. the new cases in other places is mild， for instance in beijing yesterday there is only one new case.then ppl would argue its cover up ...etc. if you know virology and you are seeing things in beijing， you would be definitely assumed. the virus need a vector to survive and close proximity to pass on. the whole streets are empty and everyone wears masks. its just impossible to spread. in a few days， everyone is returnings， that could be the second wave. but by then it would have already been 2 weeks when all the potential cases would have revealed themselves. and we have big data base to track everyone
"A virus with a 2 week incubation period and possibility of 2 week incubation period is pretty hard to track or keep in check. The numbers are probably severely under reported. I dont think the underreporting is intentional, as they have taken extreme measures to try to curb the spread, but rather it is just hard to track the actual numbers and what we are seeing is just the confirmed cases. However, seeing as how confirmed cases are popping up all over the world, it leads me to believe that there were already quite a large number of people who carried it even before the numbers started increasing in the news. Otherwise why do these travelers from Wuhan already have it when they land in cities like seattle, chicago, or LA."
"In case you don’t have patient of reading all these, Good news to those who are very worried, due to the authority has seize the tour groups and individuals who booked hotels+ flights through travel agents who are planing to travel to ALL OVER the WORLD. so the chance of you running into Chinese tourists who are travelling from China is smaller and smaller. However there are other Asian who looked Chinese but not Chinese at all, and many countries in Asia also have bank holiday over the Chinese New Year, so there will be Chinese alike Asian guests travelling in Maldives and hopefully they don’t cause threats to others who are unfamiliar with Chinese face or language. No need to mention there are Chinese descendant but actually travelling from other parts of the world, not even resides in Asia. I personally would worry about dengue fever more than coronavirus when travelling to Maldives. Travelingismyhobby, the local news actually reported actual confirmed cases and suspicion cases. The latter includes those are under quarantine and registered cases. Official estimates that possibly half of them can be confirmed in the end given that winter-spring is also the peak of flues. ( if anyone remembers the swine flue in Europe 10 years ago, it was also widely spread over the Christmas.)It’s fully understandable that you expected individual cases who never expected themselves to be infected, and who never report themselves to the emergency can be more than the confirmed cases. Speaking of information disclosure, transparency of the infected cases is far better reported in China than 17 years ago.However, the whole point of locking down WU HAN, plus many other cities nearby, is to stop further spreading. Actions taken including seize the airlines, trains, undergrounds, all public transportations and limited the mobility of private cars. Not only Wu Han but in all towns in China people decided not to go out of their houses/ flats unless absolutely necessary. And most cities, towns, villages has tighter rules than the official advisory, for instance— no mask no leaving house.— this is to stop the coronavirus from spreading further. Not only Wu Han but Many cities of Hu Bei province are locked. The local authorities had tracked down infected cases who are not from hu bei’s travel path in case he/ she takes public transportations, ie train( all high speed local train tickets are linked with the ID cards of the passenger so it’s fairly easy to identify where did the infected person been to etc. ) Travel path details including the underground/ buses/ coach, any public transportation a given patient had been taken and local authorities quarantine other passengers taking the same bus/ coach /underground at home for 14 days. If confirmed cases travel by flight then others in same flight are quarantined in at separate hotel too. If the passengers were outbound from hu bei then they had no choice but to be quarantined when they returned, fever or not. I under the feeling of fearing the unknown, invisible virus. In fact Chinese in China fear this more than anyone else. However with vast majority of the population had been staying home and will continue doing so due to the authorities decided to extend the Chinese bank holiday into 10 days, over this spring festival I personally found it help to identify those who already caught the coronavirus and the confirmed numbers will surely go up in the following days but it will not last that long on the other hand due to the quarantine. By the way due to this virus is new to everyone including the health care department, the 14 days incubation is no longer the most updated, in fact the latest discovery has confirmed that incubation period is in between 3-7 days and up to 14 days.Edited: 3:00 am, January 28, 2020 "
"tracking down is not hard. everytime you travel your identify got login in once， in china ，your identify number can pull out information of your entire life， even the words you typed in on your social chat app， even you have。deleted it. many cities competely fully covered by cams with facial recognition. you go out and purchase something you dont used credit card， you scan with your identify.so if you have something ， you will be tracked ， and everyone in contact with youunless you dont show any symptoms and you still infect， but ppl like this oy represent a tiny percentage. or you use inter provincial buses， thats a weak link which been mostly suspend. everyone use。mask in public， it is hard to transmit with mask on.Edited: 3:54 am, January 28, 2020 "
many other cities are locked， but there is a big difference with wuhan， one is to stop going out to spread， the others are locked to stop infection coming in
"Hi , traveling by plane is always a risk. Air condition and a mass of people at the airport buildings, ist not easy to avoid an illness. Maybe you wear an Mouth mask and use desinfection for your hands. On an island you have no direct contact to chinese or other people. if you use desinfection for your hand and avoid steam Rooms, so i think, ist not dangerous to get a flu, like everytime over the year. Btw, i think that in the next month also european and american people are also able to be infected....so avoid all people to be safer."
"I don't think that is nothing to worry about, incubation period is very long - even 14 days, it means that sombody is infected and spreading the virus without knowing it. Thermal scan at the airport will not help."
"I really feel for the Chinese families who have lost their holidays (and possibly their money). That must be really disappointing, and I hope that this situation is over and they are able to travel soon. I also hope that the resorts don't miss out on their revenue. There are lots of sensible comments on here about steps that people are taking to protect themselves, and we'll be doing that when we travel in a few weeks. Unless the UK government shuts the airports, we'll be on the plane and on our way.Just thought it was worth noting that we are talking about people and families here, and a bit of compassion also wouldn't go amiss."
Hi Kim. Thanks for your comments. I hope you’re enjoying your holiday. I guess it’s quieter with the Chinese travel restrictions?
"Every day at least 4 planes from China lands in Male, does anyone know if they are full??"

"@Nilesh P, you have posed your question on another thread so I am reporting your post as duplicate."
Except remember if you have elderly at home you should not take the chance you may pick up and be a carrier even if you are fine yourself. Thats why the best advice is to postpone your trip
