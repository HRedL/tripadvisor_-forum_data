"Hi Guyswe are visiting again in Feb/Mar (hopefully)Reading the requirements from the Aruba government - I am wondering if we NEED to get a Covid 19 test to enter the island ?Thanks Andrea for info !!!!!If so.. how close to flying to Aruba does it need to be done as we will not pay the ""unreal"" fee to have it done once in Aruba.Do we REALLY have to get Covid insurance . as we are staying 21 days- this will cost us approx 600.00 US (-as we are Canadians)I know that I am ranting -- but---we need to be safe, but sometimes I wonder about the methods used.Thanksme :)"
Read what is required. Covid test 72 hrs before trip. Covid insurance. Perhaps find another place to visit.
"Robin- February/March is a long way off. We usually travel to Aruba in March. We are adopting a ‘wait and see’ philosophy. One of the many reasons we travel to Aruba is that it is ‘easy’. If the cons begin to outway the pros, we may not go. We are usually booked as soon as we get home from the last trip. As we canceled on March 13 for our March 16, 2020 trip we would have been booked by now for 2021. The world is crazy Robin. I am anxious to read posts from the first July 10 group from the US or perhaps from the countries that gained access 2 days ago. My fingers are crossed and I am hoping of course for a vaccine. We adore Aruba and will be so sad if we cannot return. Good luck and hopefully we will get back to our Home Away From Home. Cheers"
Robin it appears to me you need to be able to take a test and provide the neg results within 72 hours of your flight. If you are unable to do that you will be required to pay for a test upon arrival. You will then need to quarantine for at least 24 hours as you await the results. That to me sounds like a nightmare!!!!!!As far as insurance- unless you can provide assurances you have insurance that will cover Covid each person will pay 15 dollars per day.
"We have our timeshare booked for the end of September. I will not book air until I hear the reports from the people that go in July and August. I love Aruba, but am not willing to go if the hassle becomes greater than the reward.Robin, February is a long way off. The only way all the current policies will still be in place is if we have another coronavirus flare up. If the numbers keep going down, the policies should lighten up as well."
Thanks guys I was just wondering if I read the requirements incorrectly-- thanks againTeach1977 - if I came across badly- sorry
"I am hopeful that Aruba lengthens the 72 hrs by a considerable amount.for us in our location (per my doctor's assistant) ""the test takes 30 seconds, the swab is then sent to the lab, the turnaround time even for a STAT request has been 72 to 96 hours.a friend's routine colonoscopy was cancelled yesterday due to the fact that the mandatory covid 19 test result for her had not yet gotten back from the lab. (test taken June 5)we are going in Nov (if the spike hasn't closed USA and AUA back down) and I am going to contact Allianz to get information on a special Covid policy that someone had recommended to me AND make inquiries at CVS to find out about their testing process.No questions are silly imo."
I'm afraid the covid test might be the new norm. My daughter is going to Alaska for their honeymoon in August and are required to test within 72 hours. The insurance concept I feel will be problematic and will hinder travel. I can understand maybe a nominal flat fee but $15 pp per day is steep.
"Aruba typically has over 2 million visitors a year.....even at 25% that is over 500,000 people at 15 daily....7 days on average...its well over 52 million dollars just on 25% of last years visitors."
Maybe I am just not up to date on the facts - but does regular health insurance in the USA not cover things related to having COVID-19?
There seems to be lots of confusion as to which policies cover what and if you need to pay and then be reimbursed.....as is the case with most medical situations in Aruba.
"<< “does regular health insurance in the USA not cover things related to having COVID-19?” >>If you check your health insurance provider’s website, I’m pretty sure you will find that there are no doctors or hospitals in Aruba covered by your plan.:-)Edited: 9:20 am, June 13, 2020 "
You have plenty of time...wait it outTo many moving parts now
"I know for sure that all the retirees on Medicare are not covered out of the country. Plus when you consider that the first two cases were directly connected to the US, I’m sure it’s tough for Arubans who need the tourism, to welcome one of the hardest hit areas New Jersey up through New England back to their small island."
We are on Medicare Advantage and yes we are covered for emergencies worldwide.Those on Original Medicare are not covered outside the USA.Even if you are not on a Medicare plan emergency and non emergency events are often treated differently. Review or contact your plan for coverage information

"<< “ yes we are covered for emergencies worldwide.” >>“Covered” means that if you require medical treatment in a foreign country YOU will eventually get reimbursed for some portion of whatever you had to pay out-of-pocket, at point-of-care, to any doctor or hospital in a foreign country.“Covered” does NOT mean that any doctor or hospital in a foreign country will accept your insurance card in-lieu of cash payment at point-of-care.This is why they want you to have separate “Aruba” insurance to cover potential C-19 treatment while on-sland; they want to know they will get paid up-front. You might not have sufficient cash or credit card limit to cover tens-of-thousands of dollars in costs at point-of-care.Edited: 11:42 am, June 13, 2020 "
"Ok. I get it. I didnt think of that aspect. I knew plans usually dont cover if you are outside the country, hence travel insurance. But I was reading it as regular health insurance just doesnt cover Covid no matter where you were and that just had me like ""huh?"""
"RJP is correct, I was billed by the hospital on Aruba , paid their bill and submitted the necessary documents to my insurance company . I paid a $90.00 copayment, everything else was covered in full.There is no way I could pay tens of thousands of dollars in advance. Insurance cards from the USA are not valid forms of coverage on Aruba."
Some very general Q&A on travel insurance during and before coronavirus.*******************************************https:/…
Original Medicare - Medicare Advantage and coronavirus Q&A**************************************https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-coronavirus
"This situation is still very influx. According to a few sources, the COVID insurance can be purchased directly from the Aruban government, or you can show proof of insurance purchased elsewhere. You may be able to purchase a rider on your current health insurance for overseas travel coverage, but it is unclear if that is what Aruba wants to know with this insurance. The COVID insurance is meant to cover expenses related to any quarantine actions that may need to be taken should you become sick with COVID while on the island. Since Aruba is setting up designated hotels for quarantined visitors, this insurance is meant to cover those expenses, at least as I understand it. I think there will be allot more clarification to come in next few weeks ahead of borders opening to travelers. Sources:https:/…https:/…traveler-health-requirements"
"Dear silly questions; I too have a trip planned for Aruba but the new guidelines are very strict. Once you are in their country you must follow there rules. If you are quarantined for any reason, you must stay at an ""alternative setting"" and not your hotel. What would that be like? The COVID 19 insurance is pretty expensive but what does it cover:? There are too many uncertainties so I may cancel and wait for the vaccine. Good luck!!"
The covid insurance is meant to protect you and the Aruba government from any and all bills related to an individuals corona care while on the island.
"Aruba announced today that their $15 per day covid insurance will be mandatory. I do not want to overreact to this announcement, but consider the following: In 2017 Aruba had more than one million stayover visitors and the average stay was slightly more than eight nights. If each visitor must pay $15 per night Aruba would yield $120 per person. If you do the math that equals $120,000,000.Now I realize that in 2020 and the years thereafter that Aruba will not have nearly so many visitors. But even if they receive 20% of that total it still would be $24,000,000. Another question that will have to be answered down the line is this: If I have to be hospitalized for covid,will this insurance fee cover all my medical expenses?"
"Making the insurance mandatory is kind of ridiculous. $15 pp per day for one week is over $200 for some random insurance that covers who knows what. Meanwhile, travel policies from top-ranked, well-known medical insurance companies can be purchased for ~$35 total for an entire week, and explicitly cover COVID-19 along with OTHER medical issues you may have, including the cost of evacuation if needed, and even trip cancellation/trip interruption coverage. The insurance is clearly a rip-off and I think Aruba is using it to raise money more than protect people. The rate is not at all comparable to private insurance plans, and they won't allow you to waive it if you purchase a private plan."
Are they using it to raise money? Probably but would you prefer they just create a new tourism tax? How would you feel about that? We go for 9 days in February and this will add $270 to the trip. Will that keep us away? No. Think of it as buying an extended warranty. You don’t want to use it but it gives you piece of mind if you need to.
Well said and explain JaydSome people are taking their health protection for grantedYou never know what can happen and for some reason your low on cash or Credit Card how you will get treated thanYes we know you have insurance back home that covers you abroad but remember you need to pay upfront and when go back home submit all the bills to your insurance company to get reimburse
"mohair asked.............If I have to be hospitalized for covid, will this insurance fee cover all my medical expenses?the answer is yes"
"This ""coverage"" will cost us over 600.00 for our stay for 2 of us.Also being Canadian --- this is in US funds , so add 30% onto thatSerious food for thought !"
"Robin C - I agree, the insurance plan is a bit much. The pricing structure is just not acceptable, considering full COVID-19 insurance that covers everything (cost of treatment, hospital stay, evacuation back to US, even reimbursement for a trip cut short or cancelled) can be purchased for $35 for 2 people for 2 weeks, or about $2.50 per person per day. This means the Aruba insurance is about SEVEN times more expensive than a private, well-regarded plan that you can research and compare. Meanwhile, for 7x (!!) the cost you can be forced into a plan that you cannot research on your own with who knows what sort of history of paying/fighting claims, etc."
The Aruba Visitors Insurance coverage and pricing premiums are as follows pp for ages 15-75 and are required for all visitors….: Length of Stay 6 days - $9013 days - $16521 days - $21090 days $350Ages 76+6 days - $12613 days - $23121 days - $29490 days - $609Updated June 24th 8pm…The mandatory first test upon arrival in Aruba is NOT included in this coverage ($75 at the airport).
No you didnt. Enjoy
The question this morning was asked if you arrive and the test is taken and one passenger check positive. Do all passengers have to go into quarantine the answer was. YES
