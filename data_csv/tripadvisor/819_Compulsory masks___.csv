"Due to my disability I'm exempt from wearing a mask in Britain. I have a card to confirm this. Will it work in turkey. Also what if any, restrictions are in place at hotels and pools and beaches. Also out and about the shops."
There are no exemptions in Turkey ... and apparently they are now clamping down on wearing masks due to a rise in cases in some areas.Jak xx
"You need to wear a mask everywhere, no exemptions.You dont need mask on when on sunbed, or swim on pool or sea. Or when eating or drinking at bars/restaurants. A lot more police/temp checks happening now."
"Hi iwant to travel on 26th August now I heard covid case is raising, we are worried, we don't know what to do, if you there please share your information with me, thanks"

"If so worried, better to stay home. Life involves risks whether in Turkey or UK. Stay safe."
Thanks for your replies. When on the beach sunbathing or around the pool do you have to wear face masks. Also has the prices gone up for restaurants and shops selling clothes.
"I am here now on star beach, long beach. Busy.no one wearing face masks. Very few wearing walking around on path/down road.Sunbed and cafe guys saying no one wearing as hot and on or going to beach.I wore mine from hotel in taxi to beach. All seemed well organised at airport, easy and quick. Nothing feels different except wearing mask and hand washing/sanitizing a lot!Very hot and as beautiful as always."
