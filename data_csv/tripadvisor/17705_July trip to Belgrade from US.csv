"Hi everyone, I have to travel from the US to Belgrade in July for a family issue. Has anyone from the US visited Serbia since they opened their borders? If so, what was your experience entering and exiting the country, as well as re-entering the US? Thank you!"
"Following this in case someone jumps in before I get to be the proverbial guinea pig. I’m scheduled to fly to Belgrade June 30 arriving July 1 with a short transit (less than 5 hours) in Amsterdam. I have confirmed tickets from Amsterdam to Belgrade so I believe I am clear there. If all goes well(and I guess, even if it doesn’t) I’ll do my best to follow up on how things go. I was literally the first person through customs on June 8 to Cancun Mexico when Mexico reopened to tourism (for air travel only) and tried to post as many details there for everyone. Hopefully my Serbia trip will go as smoothly."
"Thank you and I hope you have safe travels! I am booked nonstop to LHR from the US on July 4 with a short transit and then on to Belgrade. My family in Serbia said that the borders are open at present, however they don’t know the experience of entering and exiting. We’ll see.Edited: 7:47 pm, June 28, 2020 "
Thank you for the updates! A friend of mine will be traveling to Beograd from Seattle next week so your update will be very useful.
"Everything is open so if you don't need a visa and don't overstay there is no other official advice.However, clearly things can change! With the epidemic numbers in USA it's perfectly possible entry restrictions could be applied if USA doesn't get a grip. Also, there have been increased cases in Serbia so measures could also be put in place for local reasons. It's all a risk at the moment IMOYou need comprehensive insurance cover, personally I'd separate visiting family and essential travel from 'tourism' for a while. The former a calculated risk often worth taking, the latter an unnecessary risk but each to their own decisions in these uncertain times.I have to say as an ignorant observer. After Serbia did so well in keeping numbers down I was amazed they then opened air gates for all countries without health checks. Many locals wonder why they are not more protected from a new imported increase and potential spread.Stoofer."
I think so few Americans will actually fly to Serbia now that it will make very little difference.
Eva. There are a large number of Serbs living in USA - the initial 'kick-off' of this virus in Serbia was largely down to expats coming home from various countries in the grip of contagion. I hope you are right but the airlines are trying to attract business...obviously.Stoofer
"But the Serbs in the US could return to Serbia even if Serbia was not open to all foreigners, right?"
"Yes Eva, I was now talking about the second point. The latter regarding the general opening of flights, many are worried about virus coming in from USA with no health checks regardless of what passport the carrier.Stoofer"
"Just wanted to update before I fall asleep. I’m totally wiped out from the flight from DFW to Amsterdam and the connecting (transit) flight to Belgrade. I hit a snag at DFW early on because I couldn’t check in online and had to go to the actual ticket counter to do so. Fortunately I had flown in to Dallas the night before so I had plenty of time. Then the airline employees were divided on whether I could actually board the flight to Amsterdam (I flew American Airlines there and had a confirmed ticket to Belgrade on Transavia a few hours after the AA flight was scheduled to land). Fortunately I knew that transit passengers were allowed in Amsterdam (you cannot leave the airport) and waited patiently while the ticket agent went to talk to the supervisor. She came back and confirmed that I was indeed allowed to fly to Amsterdam as a transit passenger. She took my Transavia ticket and entered it into the flight record and that was all I had to do before going through security. There is a health declaration form for Amsterdam if you transit there that you will need to fill out and the airlines will have one for you. Or, you can print it out like I did beforehand. It’s on the Netherland Embassy or Consulate website, I can’t remember (did I mention I’m exhausted lol?)Amsterdam was frighteningly easy. There were gate agents waiting at the deplaning site and they asked if Amsterdam was your final destination. If you were transiting onward they just waved you through to “all gates” and that was it. No screening, temperature checks, anything. I walked to my next gate and waited. And maybe ate a bag of stroop waffles. Or two. At Belgrade you simply deplaned and went straight though to immigration. If you are Serbian national you go to the gate marked “Serbia” and if not then you either go to “Other Countries” or “EU and Other Countries Who Do Not Need a Visa” (that’s us Americans btw). The immigration official looked at my health form (they hand it to you on the flight to Serbia) and my passport, stamped it and waved me through without so much as a question. I walked out the exit door, walked across the street and up the steps then back across the street to the upper level arrivals area and caught the 72 bus into Belgrade for 150 dinar (paid the driver directly). It would have been 89 dinar (90 cents roughly) if I had purchased a bus card but I wasn’t about to argue over 50 cents. I wasn’t asked about a return flight either, now that I think about it. All in all it was one of the simplest transits (Amsterdam) and Immigration and Entry (Belgrade) that I’ve ever experienced. Despite the copious amount of coffee I’ve had since landing I’m wiped and about to go to sleep. Everyone has been lovely here and I am incredibly excited about being able to explore this country over the next week or so. Hope this puts everyone’s mind at ease. I don’t know if my transit was made easier because the AA agent put the continuing journey and flight info onto my DFW - AMS ticket because honestly no one at the gate when my flight deplaned even asked me anything other than if AMS was my final destination. Hope everyone else has a safe and easy journey as well."
"BlondeWithADogThank you so much!!! I am on a similar flight plan, though transiting through LHR. I have been very reticent about this trip, since there was not much sharing of the actual experience of traveling to Serbia right now. You have been so very helpful. I wish you a very safe trip!"
"Remember to keep a mask with you at all times.Public transport and enclosed places it's now mandatory with virus numbers being watched - as per previous threads, this aint over yet so visitors/travelers need to be prepared.Stoofer"
Thank you so much for sharing your experience! Certainly very helpful to other people.
Oh yes Stooferuk! I forgot to mention that. Please bring a mask and wear it whenever you are on public transport or inside a shop. I am quite honestly surprised that hardly anyone wears their mask while walking around in public though. I understand it is hot but I just spent 4 weeks in Mexico and everyone wore one except when at the beach or in the ocean. Please be mindful of safe distance if you can and be a good ambassador for the US so maybe we will be allowed to travel to some more countries when we get our Covid act together.
"And it could become more restrictive, it's a fast moving situation.Stoofer"
Thank you SO much! Your information is very helpful!!!
"Just to add to this:I flew from New York through Zurich into Belgrade via SWISS this week. The check-in agent had to double check that I was allowed to fly to Belgrade, which took about three minutes, but then there were no problems at all.There was a contract tracing form we had to fill out on the New York - Zurich flight, but we didn't get another one on the Zurich - Belgrade flight. Immigration was super simple: not a single question about my purpose of travel or a return/onward ticket. And then I was in Serbia!I'd say that only 5-10% of people are wearing masks outside, and about 70% were wearing them in the grocery store. The guy at the deli was wearing one around his chin, so no deli meat for me! It's a bit nerve-wracking with rising numbers and so few people wearing masks, but it is what it is."
"Latest is nightclubs and bars close from 11pm - 6am - effectively closing off the nightlife scene.There could be more to follow, it's all being considered today. As I have touched upon on several threads, the situation is far from normal and can go backwards,I do think too many potential visitors are in too much of a rush to get here, or anywhere for that matter, personally I would watch and wait but?Safe travelsStoofer"
"Yes, people are not traveling much even if they can - we are seeing it here in the Czech Republic - basically most of Europe can come here without any limitations and yet we are basically only seeing Czechs and Germans"
"I’m interested in this thread as I am also mid July going through Amsterdam to Belgrade, Serbia. When you deplaned, were you able to walk through the terminal and go to the restroom or stop to get food or anything before you had to go through immigration, or were you pushed straight through to immigration upon exiting? I’m wondering because my fiancé is flying in from a different country an hour earlier than me and we wanted to go through immigration together, so he was going to wait for me until I arrived. Thanks for any insight and hope your trip goes well!"
"@Electric Gypsy: Belgrade airport has an unusual configuration where inbound and outbound passengers are mixed in the same area. As a result, upon arrival you can stay in the airside hall as long as you wish and enjoy the facilities before you go through immigration."
Thank you so much! I have never been to Belgrade and was concerned that I would have a hard time finding him if he were scooted out through immigration before I got there.
"To follow on from my post 17 here 3rd July.......At time of writing a curfew is planned for this weekend, 6pm Friday - 5am Monday. Belgrade only but that can change to be wider and no idea as to the situation next week. Most likely open through the week with restrictions but this is really no time for vacation visitors.Stoofer"
"What does the curfew entail ? You have to stay inside your accommodation ?My girlfriend should be landing at 7:25pm at BEG, I suppose she can still take a taxi to her hotel in Vracar ?"
"Yes, very strictly enforced - there will be police on the streets and they will stop you and fine you, or worse.Yes taxi from airport should be fine, pre book recommended. Allow RSD 2000. What hotel?StooferP.S. It's possible this could change but unlikely."
"Vucic is giving a press conference this afternoon thereafter we should know more.If you are in Belgrade when no curfew at the moment avoid demonstrations and groups, usually central around Parliament and Pasic Square. There has been rioting with infiltrators into demonstrations using violence.The opposition position appears to be that Vucic opened up the lock down early seeking popularity due to the election with no regard for the people and potential spread. I'm not into the politics but frankly that position is a joke because they are also saying there should be no curfew and no lock down now even with current epidemic numbers. Well surely you can't have it both ways!Anyway, take care because there are always a minority of far right thugs in demonstrations around the city, just keep well away is best advice, keep a low profile.Stoofer"
"The hotel I've booked is Smokvica Vracar (wanted Smokvica Dorcol, but their A/C broke down... ).Just talked to the hotel manager and she told me about this 3pm announcement, she'll give me info just after.We're just using BG as a stepping stone to Tanzania - I have Serbian citizenship and a (very old) flat there, so it is easier for me, and besides this is one of the very few countries where my girlfriend can get a flight to (Aeroflot runs repatriation flights with erratic schedules, she can hop on on the way out), and doesn't need a visa for (and some contacts of mine made her a work contract, to facilitate her getting out of the country).Ideally we'd be out again on Wednesday 15 or Friday 17. If the curfew is just for Belgrade, maybe we could spend the first couple of days in Novi Sad ?Edited: 7:51 am, July 08, 2020 "
"Just got a message from Airserbia that my girlfriend's flight from Moscow on Saturday has been cancelled...Edited: 8:15 am, July 08, 2020 "
"The Smokvica location, garden and vibe is very good IMO - I can't say for the rooms but it's got a good rep.You would be away from likely demonstration areas.At the moment Novi Sad yes and it's easy to get to but that could change.I was going to ask about flights but didn't want to tempt fate for you........... Unfortunately this forum has been plagued with relentless 'information links' to other forum and websites spouting about latest schedules etc. The problem is there is no local knowledge from the source and total ignorance about how this pandemic is being dealt with locally and it's affects in Serbia. It's all so unpredictable.Stoofer"
"I called Aeroflot and Air Serbia and got an update.Aeroflot maintains that code-shared flight (and the one on the 9th), so I rebooked with them - at twice the price I paid yesterday... - it's just that Air Serbia doesn't want to honor the booking (which I did through Expedia), claiming that these flights were never for sale. Even though they were bookable on their website yesterday ! They appeared for the first time yesterday (just as they did on Aeroflot's website) and disappeared today (but are still on Aeroflot's). Last week's flights on the 2nd and 4th of July were also bookable on both airlines' websites, there are not regularly scheduled, but some sort of repatriation flights which the Russian government allows a few days in advance, at which point they become bookable. There are others to places like Paris, Frankfurt, London...I'm perfectly aware of flights that are supposed to happen at some point in the future, and are bookable on the website, but never eventually materialize, but these are ongoing flights, not some kind of hopeful future scheduleThe manager (?) of Smokvica tells me that the curfew hasn't been confirmed, after yesterday's riots. It was announced in this speech yesterday - did they backtrack ?https://www.predsednik.rs/en/press-center/ne…(I can't believe they're still ventilating people... )"
"UPDATE.In his press conference Vucic just said that he believes the curfew should stand and rioters do not sway the decision however he respects and listens to his 'team' and they have offered alternatives. He is now indicating that further measures will be imposed but the curfew is now ""unlikely"" if people conform.Have to say, these unclear messages from government don't help visitors. So now no curfew but that could possibly change.....make of it all what you will, either way clearly it's not ideal for visitors in Belgrade right now.Stoofer"
"Our posts crossed,....Last night Vucic confirmed curfew, an hour ago he said he will respect other views from his team, more measures but no curfew. Make of it what you will.Regarding flights, the situation you have is exactly why some regulars here were protesting when another member usually on other forums kept posting new flight schedules when it's known locally that they are not guaranteed even ongoing flights as you find. It's all unpredictableStooferEdited: 11:59 am, July 08, 2020 "
"Thanks for the explanation, much clearer now.Se he backtracked :)I know which posts you allude to, personally I never took them for anything other than ""planned schedules subject to future confirmation"", but I understand that it may have confused some people."
"It looks that way except he added ""if people conform"", so no curfew now but he's still left the door open......to close. Good luck with your visitStoofer"
Thank you.If I make it on Sunday I will probably have a couple of questions to ask re:practical details
"I've been in Belgrade for a week now, and it has been interesting to watch things unfold.For perspective, I spent April, May, and June in New York City, which was the epicenter of the pandemic. The cases were completely out of control, but they very quickly decreased because of mask wearing, social distancing, requiring most people to work from home (if possible), limiting contact with people outside your household, and only allowing restaurants to do takeaway. These measured worked very well, and now New York sees about 300 new cases per day, which is very small compared to the peak of 6,000 new cases per day.Now that I am in Belgrade, it feels very weird to see almost nobody wearing masks outside, even in crowded places. Masks are mandatory inside and on public transport, but still we see many people not wearing them. Restaurants are open for outdoor dining (and even indoor dining, though few people eat inside); however, few restaurants are moving tables far enough apart for people to stay distant from others. The number of cases is continuing to increase here, and I fear that if people do not take more precautions, the number of cases will soon be out of control.These are just my observations, comparing what I saw in New York and what I see in Belgrade.Anyway, the proposed lockdown appeared to be a measure that was more for control of the people than control of the virus. Closing a city for two and a half days and then going back to normal is not going to stop the spread of the virus. What we need are thoughtful, sustainable measures that people can live with. And I believe the protesters feel similarly. They are angry that Vucic ignored the pandemic and opened everything so that he could have his election, and now that he has won, he wants to pull a 180 and lock everything down. One thing that is encouraging: the protesters have been wearing masks at a much higher rate than the general population. This makes me feel that they're putting some thought into this, as opposed to simply protesting a lockdown.I think that as the number of cases go up and locals know people who have personally gotten sick, we'll see more people wearing masks. This, coupled with more sustainable measures, would be a good way forward. But we'll see how things actually play out.As of right now, it appears that the lockdown will not be happening (as others have said). I imagine there will be new announcements in the upcoming days, as the status quo cannot be maintained."
"Thanks Mike. Your reasoning exactly resonates with mine. There's a certain cultural difference at play: in general, peoples of Eastern Europe and former Ottoman Empire are generally distrustful with the government and the state, a condition caused by centuries of experience and tradition of corruption and dictatorship. As a result, a significant portion of people see recommendations and rules as something that should be bent or worked around rather than obeyed. And it's sort of Serbian national stereotype, even a source of pride, to regard ourselves as ""rebellious"", ""stubborn"", ""spiteful"" or ""proud"". Such qualities may be useful in warfare or sport, but not so much in coping with a pandemic.""What we need are thoughtful, sustainable measures that people can live with."" - I can't agree more, but it seems so remote a prospect at this moment."
"Thanks Mike, good post!My thoughts for what it's worth.........Belgrade and Serbia did go through many of the measures you describe.""closing a city for two and a half days and then going back to normal is not going to stop the spread of the virus""The weekend closures (with weekday distancing) helped control spread in the past months, curfews were a feature of the measures and policy. Much of the spread has been driven by younger generations all mixing during nightlife and leisure. Go to work but cease partying does make sense, many would say IMO. It's fairly obvious to me that the protesters are more than protesting about the curfew 'proposal'. IMO there are outside forces at work with political games before health and it's not all due to the government IMHOThe opposition blame increased cases on relaxing the lock-down rules due to the referendum but Vucic would likely have won anyway and then why are they now saying a curfew and strong measures are not required? Be either for these strong measures or against, they can't have it both ways.I agree with Makicak, the local culture is driving rebellion. If true how do you deal with that without a forced curfew and stricter policed measures? Some responsibility must lie with the population IMOI should be in Belgrade (for weeks now) but have held off, speaking to family and friends locally it's a very sad situation causing unrest that can get out of control.Look after each other and stay safeStoofer"
"My fiancé and I were planning to go to Belgrade next week, but he was just informed today that his flight was cancelled from Tunis to Belgrade. They told him that it’s because the borders were closing. Anyone know if there is any truth to this?"
"There is truth in this indeed. Situation is changing daily, but as epidemic situation in Serbia gets worse, many countries are closing borders for travelers from Serbia, and airlines canceling already confirmed or postponing announced flights. Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring."
Indeed yes I went to Dallas airport today you can transit anywhere as long to don't enter The EU and do not have a layover for 5 to 10 hours you'll be fine.
"Thank you so much for your updates. I am planning to fly from US to Moscow in late September to visit family, probably with a transit through Amsterdam or Helsinki, and have a stopover in Belgrade on the way back to JFK. NY State used to be the worst, and now one of the best COVID_wise, anywhere, let's hope it stays this way as the government here is aggressively enforcing health policy (I'm in rural upstate NY, so even better). Provided NY and Moscow stay even and Serbia is open, I would love a day stop over in Belgrade - I refuse to board direct Aeroflot and Delta flights from Moscow, besides they have no flexible option, like Finnair and the Star Alliance group... Any updates on cultural venues open in Belgrade? I plan to stay in the center and walk everywhere and distance, as I normally do, just a bit more...are masks required and used in Belgrade?"
"I just arrived on Saturday, US Passport. Very uneventful, they just looked at my passport, stamped it, and handed it back to me. No questions.To Answer Margarita's question: Museums are open, public transit is being utilized, restaurants have outdoor dining areas open (some seem to have indoor dining areas open too but not sure if that is legal). About 5-10% of people are using masks outside, 75-80% of people are using them in the stores. I guess this is better than nothing, but I am also from New York and the mask participation is actually higher so this is coming as a bit of a shock. The numbers of COVID cases are coming down (according to government figures), so that's positive news.Edited: 3:27 pm, August 10, 2020 "
"Thank you, this is super helpful, still planning to go if things stay quiet... Enjoy your stay!"
