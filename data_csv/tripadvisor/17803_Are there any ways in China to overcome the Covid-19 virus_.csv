"It seems that China is now in the way to overcome the Covid-19 virus, right? But, this does not seems to be due to effective drugs or vaccines, or because most Chinese are infected: it is said that only 80 thousand out of 1.4 billion people (0.005%) are infected in China. I wonder whether there are any ways to overcome the virus in China that the rest of the World can learn, athough we cannot follow any communistic ways ignoring private rights. We have seen many pictures of China in February but not in March when they only showed us pictures of Europe and America , which only gave us fear to this virus. Thus, I want to ask this question to people living in China."
"Testing and quarantine. China is recovering, so is Korea. Korea is not a communist country.Keep your private rights and see your medical facilities overwhelmed and people dying every day, Look at Italy.Edited: 8:34 pm, March 25, 2020 "
"I was talking to my brother yesterday regarding 200,000 Singaporeans expecting to return from overseas, very concerned because Singapore is almost like China now where most cases are imported. I was thinking, they should spread out the arrivals of these Singaporeans, it is common sense. Today my local newspaper reported that China will only allow foreign airlines to operate just one route per week from Sunday and domestic airlines will be restricted to flying to only one country no more than once a week. China is acting pretty fast."
"There are 3 ways. Group immunity, vaccine or medicine. No country is the same, so each country has to see what is the best option for their situation.China went for complete lockdown, and has the focus on vaccine and medicine. Given the dense population, and the very high pressure on the medical organizations, I think this was about the only approach. If it was the right one, time has to tell.The US is willing to accept many death in exchange for group immunity, as it looks now. It is normal there that money is valued higher than a life. They calculate. Not new. Just look at their weapon policies and healthcare system.Other countries are somewhere in between."
"Countries who have the virus under control will constantly be exposed from outside countries who are still having epidemics until an effective drug or vaccine is found so they will continue to be afraid and affected in terms of public confidence and global trade. This may last for 2 years before things become normal with a combination of herd immunity, drug treatment and final vaccine implementation around the world. Many poor countries will only have herd immunity and this go on for many years before those regions populations have enough herd immunity but will be a constant source of re-infection across the world for many years.China is no longer for many decades a communist country since it became a successful totalitarian capitalist country. Unfortunately for democratic or pluralistic countries like USA, China’s system of government will turn out to be more effective to control the population in pandemic quarantine lockdowns. China’s internal security system to control its population is said to be so large and equal in budget spending to its military, which can be used very effectively for pandemic lockdowns. South Korea is currently a noted exception in controlling the virus.The USA hasn’t chosen a path to accept large deaths, instead this is simply the situation it finds itself in with the choices it has made over budget spending. In fact the US health system costs about 10 times more per person than some countries with socialised universal health systems, with less results. The death rate in the USA may not be as high as they have the highest ratio of intensive care hospital beds of any country, about 2.5 times more per head of population than Italy which is about in the top 3-4 countries, despite the US health care system covering less of the population and so expensive.Edited: 11:46 am, March 27, 2020 "
"It has been re-purposed, like many businesses, during these difficult times. GM needs to manufacture ventilators, UA using passenger planes to run freights, restaurants selling grocery."
"Maybe the China Travel Forum is not the best place to discuss strategies for countries to overcome a virus pandemic. China has much more experience in handling virus epidemics than other countries have. That is what they jabe shown again. Not sure when it will be over. Let us hope the best for all countries and all people and let us not talk about political systems now.Edited: 5:23 am, March 31, 2020 "
