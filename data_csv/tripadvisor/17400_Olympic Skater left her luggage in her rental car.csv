"Eeeek! I call alarmist!!! eeek, eeek, eeek!"
"Call me alarmist, but here is the relevant paragraph. Note that such calls are diverted to 311, and someone will get back to you whenever:Castelli, whose skates were also stolen, said she called 911 immediately. Such calls are now diverted to 311 if the break-in is over and no suspect is nearby. She filed an online police report .....“We take these seriously and we’re glad she filed a report,” said David Stevenson, a San Francisco police spokesman. “We want to do everything we can to help people recover their property.”And what is this ""everything we can""?"
"""Eeeek! I call alarmist!!! eeek, eeek, eeek!""It is alarmist. Why not repost links to every Bay Area crime?"
"Well, as a big fan of figure skating I think it is terrible! I assume ""everything we can"" means ""we cant do anything further""."
I didn’t post it for any reason other than it involved a person of some fame.I’m about as opposite as can be from an “alarmist” so that wasn’t my intention at all.
Then why not post stories about every celebrity in town?
How about you don’t talk to me and I won’t respond to you?
"It's not alarmist if a certain kind of crime is hitting tourists especially hard. Car break ins have become epidemic in SF, and many tourists drive rental cars with their luggage inside."
This is a bit different in the fact that these stolen articles are items that are custom made and fit to be used solely in competition. So it's not just stealing things it's like stealing someone's potential and something they have poured their heart and soul into. What do locals or seasoned travelers usually recommend visitors to San Francisco do with their luggage after checking out of their hotel? Just wondering what the usual advice is.I assume renting an SUV was not a good choice. Or does it matter?
"I'm all for warning people about the problem of car break-ins if they provide some context about the odds of being a victim and how to reduce your chances of being a victim. The story didn't do that. If what was posted was something like, ""Here's why you should hide or remove valuables in your car if you have one in San Francisco"", that would have been great.It's similar to the way the Kate Steinle story convinced people that San Francisco was inherently unsafe, and if they came they'd be shot by an illegal alien.If you look at the number of break-ins compared to the number of cars in the city, the odds of being a victim is very low.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Sure. But, the car-break-in phenomenon is now a major issue for residents and visitors alike. It is something that neighbors, family and friends are all experiencing. It is cutting across all demographics and geography. It reminds me of the late 80s and early 90s. Today I read about thieves targeting cars parked at Griffith Observatory. Unfortunately, the issue isn't a priority for elected officials."
"** “It's not alarmist if a certain kind of crime is hitting tourists especially hard. Car break ins have become epidemic in SF, and many tourists drive rental cars with their luggage inside.” **Exactly.** “If you look at the number of break-ins compared to the number of cars in the city, the odds of being a victim is very low.” **And if you look at certain specific locations frequented by tourists, the odds soar. Maybe your car parked on Teresita near Agua isn’t gonna get hit, or someone else’s at 8th and Anza or , or mine up the street from St. Aidan’s Episcopal Church. Tourists don’t hang out in these places, and rental cars are not that common, and residents are savvy enough not to leave valuables around. But we’ve all seen the media coverage about certain areas that have the worst stats: Fisherman’s Wharf. Lombard Street, Great Highway, JFK Drive, the 16th and Moraga Steps. The visitors who get victimized on those streets don’t give a big fat rat’s heinie about stats or odds; to them, it IS an epidemic and they ARE unhappy and p***sed off and they ARE going to tell their family and friends and readers on TripAdvisor that they left it all in San Francisco and in their estimation the police, city elected officials, and car rental companies don’t care.And I challenge anyone who calls some of us “alarmists” to tell those poor tourists who lose everything they brought or bought here that we are “alarmists.” I think those victims would be grateful that some locals are concerned enough about visitors' welfare to give these warnings."
"Then why not post all stories of murders and armed robberies in the city? Tourists are potential victims of those crimes, just like they're potential victims of car break-ins."
"There has been a big spike in these crimes. Does not hurt to remind visitors. https:/…>>>Last year saw more than 30,000 car break-ins in San Francisco, a 24 percent spike from 2016, which was already at epidemic levels, according to new end-of-the-year data provided by the Police Department.<<<I always put things out of sight in the city. Today, I left my diaper bag/backpack with my wallet in the backseat here in the South Bay in front of Trader Joe's. Probably shouldn't do that any more.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Her luggage was probably in plain view with a rental SUV with no cover.>>What do locals or seasoned travelers usually recommend visitors to San Francisco do with their luggage after checking out of their hotel? Just wondering what the usual advice is.<<Don't leave it unattended, especially if exposed like this. Take things you can't replace easily with you like passport, electronics, and in her case... the outfits. If a sedan, don't mess with the trunk once you park.Edited: 2 years ago "
"^^ That's the kind of thing that should be discussed, rather than simply posting a story that offered nothing in the way of how to protect yourself from break-ins.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I just saw a news report saying that a car gets hit every 15 minutes. I called this out, along with homelessness and empty storefronts, to London Breed when she announced running for mayor. I also recommended that she check out TA to see our city’s reputation."
"""I just saw a news report saying that a car gets hit every 15 minutes.""It's these kinds of numbers that drive me up the wall. They sound scary, but mean nothing. If there are 1000 cars in a city, it's a big problem. If there are a million cars in the city, it's much less of a problem. What I want to know is what are the chances of my car being broken into, and what can I do to reduce the odds. Last year I was running through some SF crime numbers, and saw cars in SF had a 5% chance per year of being broken into. Divide that by 365 and you get about a 0.014% daily chance of your car being broken into in SF. If break-ins have gone up 24% in the last year, that increases chances of a break-in to 0.017% per day."
"My advice to visitors is to never leave things in a car if you have another option. Leave bags at the hotel before check in or after check out. If you must leave luggage in a car, take all irreplaceable/valuable items with you in a separate a purse, shoulder bag or backpack that you carry with you and keep an eye on the whole time (don't sling it over the back of your chair in a restaurant where you can't monitor it). That bag is for items like phones, tablets, computers, passports, wallets, cameras, hard to replace medicines, etc. Put luggage in the trunk or at least a covered area in the car before arriving where you're going to park if you need to leave it in a parked car.Theft doesn't happen all the time or everywhere, but if you can follow these precautions easily, then why tempt fate? You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy! Different rules apply different places, so you might need to adjust your behavior compared to your normal behavior in your home town. No need to stress or think everyone is out to steal your stuff, because they're not, but realistically some tiny part of the population has stealing your stuff as one of their goals for the day.I wish more were done about car break ins, package thieves and all the rest that comes up here, on NextDoor, or other places. From what I understand, the perpetrators of these crimes don't get caught often, even with clear video evidence showing the criminals. I believe that police don't/can't do much except in the most egregious cases with repeat offenders. I'm not necessarily blaming them because they have their own resourcing problems and laws make it harder to get meaningful convictions except in egregious cases because thievery/theft of lower-value items is now a misdemeanor in California, from what I understand. Criminals also come from areas around causing more crimes here against easier targets and an overwhelmed police force.Do the things you can to protect your own stuff."
"GB Thanks for posting this and to the others who have great advice for our visitors --Thank you. Only a small subset of visitors to SF read this forum but if it helps even 1 or 2 visitors from leaving things visible -- and reducing their chance of being broken in, that is a victory."
The original post wasn't helpful. The discussion afterwards was.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Simba, I appreciate the statistical analysis. However, my experience is this is something new. For many years, visitors often asked about crime and safety. For many years I told them don't worry about it because of the stats and my own experience. Crime wasn't a concern. (I lived in downtown LA at the time.) Not anymore. I now hear people talking about being victimized by these kinds of break-ins. It is happening everywhere, including places I would have considered very safe only a short time ago. All the advice about valuables in a car is good. But, we are In a situation there is a disconnect between public policy and reality. For now, car break-ins are a serious and widespread and growing problem. Until public policy is adjusted to this unpleasant reality, visitors and residents must adjust their behavior accordingly."
"HitchKennedy, it is a growing problem. I just don't like it when people post stories of individual crimes, because too many people will over-generalize and think the problem is worse than it really is.Back when there was a panic about freeway shootings in LA, did LA residents stop driving on freeways? No, because they knew the chances of being shot on the freeway were very small. Yet plenty of people from outside of California probably cancelled their vacation plans to LA because they were worried about getting shot.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Absolutely amazing how one poster can turn a news report of a ""semi"" celeb Olympic Skater who was a victim of a property crime while visiting our city into something that it isnt. Now this poster has set rules for how things ought to be worded when they are posted, have given specific instructions on making sure to include statistics (whether those stats are acuurate or not I dont think it matters)So please everyone before you post something on this form send this poster from Pacifica a PM and make sure it meets her criteria before you post something, even as simple as a news report.Now you dont need to follow my suggestion, I know I sure as hell wont. I wish there was an ignore button for idiots on this forum that make it about their own agenda rather than using the forum for what it is. Its really very simple.Edited: 2 years ago "
+1 Goodbeer . :-)and the same applies to saying anything unflattering about Fisherman's wharfEdited: 2 years ago 
"Childish response, GoodBeer."
"<<<Childish response, GoodBeer.>>>Do you really want me to go back through this thread and pull out all of your repsonses directed toward me, For posting a news report about an Olympic Skater? I really dont care what you think, I really dont care that you feel that people need to only post under your terms. Now you are calling my response childish? We can keep going if you want?Edited: 2 years ago "
"My complaint was with posting the article in a way that I thought gave a misleading impression of what was going on with car break-ins in SF. If you take that as a personal affront, so be it.Edited: 2 years ago "
"<<<My complaint was with posting the article in a way that I thought gave a misleading impression of what was going on with car break-ins in SF.>>>No, your assumption was that I posted the news report to give that impression. I then responded that it was not my intention at all to do that, in which you responded that maybe we should begin posting about all people of some fame that are in SF. Again, it was a simple news report about someone that is (I use celeb losely) ""semi"" famous. Had this same skater fallen down on the sidewalk and hit her chin Im sure you wouldnt have an issue with it being posted. Instead you make assumptions on why I posted this and then turn it into your own agenda."
"""Had this same skater fallen down on the sidewalk and hit her chin Im sure you wouldnt have an issue with it being posted.""OK, it is true that I didn't believe your excuse that you posted the story simply because it was about a celebrity. If  the same skater had fallen down and hit their chin on the sidewalk, would you have posted a link to the story. I doubt it.I'll stop posting on this particular item."
