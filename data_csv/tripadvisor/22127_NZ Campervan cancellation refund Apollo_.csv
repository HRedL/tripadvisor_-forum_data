"Hey all, I have a campervan hire booked with Apollo NZ in early April 2020 and wondering if anyone has cancelled their bookings with Apollo due to NZ Covid-19 restrictions and if you were able to get a refund or not? Looks like Jetstar may decide to cancel all our flights so we would be unable to even get to NZ."

On the upper right of this page there is the box of top questions - click on Apollo and read of all the ways they refuse to refund - best of luck :)
"We're in the same situation as you. It's beyond unfortunate that this virus has created so much disruption and devastation around the world. But we understand... We are a 68 yo couple, recently retired and have been planning this trip for 3 years. All of the airlines have contacted us with exceptionally fair trip cancellation information. Although our (different) campervan rental company has been terrific with rental info, suggestions, policies, etc, we've had no information forthcoming from them regarding the obvious required need to cancel. The very real threat of this dangerous virus spreading, as has occurred in other parts of the world, has caused the NZ government to take the unprecedented step of requiring a mandatory 14-day isolation period for all travelers to NZ. Realizing the negative economic impact this and other necessary measures would have on the NZ economy, the government announced a sweeping $12.1 billion financial assistance package. Much of the money is designated to help offset employee wages and business losses. The announcement is described in the NZ Herald on 3-17-20...""The Government has unveiled a $12.1 billion support package for the New Zealand economy, with almost half of the cash to be spent on a wage subsidy package for all coronavirus-impacted businesses.Those full-time workers eligible for the package will receive $585 per week from the Government, paid in a lump sum package of just over $7000 covering a 12-week period.The Government is also raising benefits by $25 a week, starting April 1, and doubling the Winter Energy Payment.""This is wonderful news for all NZ employees, especially those in the hard-hit tourism and associated industries.So, given: 1. the unusual, unique and unfortunate circumstances created by the world-wide, easily spread virus, which 2. knows no master and has no vaccine, and3. the NZ government's correct, mandatory 14-day self-isolation requirement for all travelers to NZ, and 4. other nations' travel restrictions, and5. the $5.1 billion (of $12.1 billion package) for direct wage subsidy financial assistance to employees and business,the government is robustfully and aggressively supporting their disrupted NZ business, while doing their best to protect the NZ and visitor populations. Therefore, those business should likewise support their customers' disrupted travel plans by offering total refunds. Probably like you, we've spent untold hours planning our trip all around both islands. Our intention is to not let those hours go to waste by now planning our trip for April 2021. Hopefully we'll be utilizing the same campervan rental company."
"***Although our (different) campervan rental company has been terrific with rental info, suggestions, policies, etc, we've had no information forthcoming from them regarding the obvious required need to cancel.***Have you asked them?."
Stay tuned!
"@McPickWe have campervan booked with Wilderness motorhomes, currently they are sticking to their standard T&C's. We are meant to pickup on 6th April, if we cancel now 50% refund, if we cancel with less then 7 days to go 0 refund. They are not being flexible, there website is just warm words, I have emailed twice and same standard response I hope this fiscal package will help them change their minds.Like you we are looking to postpone until April 2021, but airline has no schedule for that time so will only offer a voucher but if they go bust before we spend it will be worthless.its a dilemma!"
"Hi,It looks like you are stuck in the UK for at least 30 Days so it's a moot point.https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/…Cheers,"
"Here's a bit of an update on my campervan rental situation. My rental is with a different company from the one mentioned above. I also encourage others affected by the travel restrictions, now border closure, to report on their campervan refund efforts as well. And especially a robust ""shout-out"" for those companies that realize, in the long term, they will financially benefit much more from glowing, appreciative reviews for having provided full refunds, than those companies whose short-sighted greed will be revealed.I contacted the company where I have rented a certified campervan for the entire month of April 2020. And let me say upfront that their customer service has been top-notch from the start. I have thanked them profusely on numerous occasions for their attentiveness, advice and perspectives. Which is why I have been somewhat surprised that they have not taken the initiative to contact me. Especially after the government imposed the 14-day self-isolation period, followed by the government's announcement of the $12.1 billion dollar financial assistance package. How fortunate, as reported in the NZ Herald and elsewhere, that $5.1 billion of those monies will be distributed directly to employees of affected businesses. I included this information when I emailed a full refund request to the campervan company on 3-17. I asked if they have re-evaluated their cancellation policy due to the unfortunate, unforeseen and unprecedented world-wide disruptions this dangerous virus has caused. The reply I received was (understandably) an after-hours, computer generated response indicating they are ""open for business."" The correspondence then directed me to the NZ Ministry of Health's website which describes self-isolation in detail. The document does provide a brief summary and instructions regarding the use of ""short-term accommodation (such as a hotel, motel or vacation rental)"". However, it does not mention, describe, or provide any instructions for campervan rentals, or renters. And yet, the campervan company I rented from stated in their email that, ""There is no better place to self-isolate than a campervan, travelling pristine New Zealand."" HmmmAdditionally, the NZ Ministry website states that, ""Facemasks are not recommended as an effective means of preventing the spread of infection."" Meanwhile, the final note on my campervan company's email noted, ""there is a shortage of masks left for purchase in NZ. If you are able to bring masks for things such as grocery shopping during self-isolation, this is recommended."" Hmmm x 2!I've read the discussion/opinions in another post in this forum regarding the use of campervans for self-isolation. Some are for it, others are not. Given all of the updated information regarding the virus in NZ, and that we are the ones who would have to try and comply with the rulings (yikes!) I tended to agree with the latter opinion. Obviously this is all moot, now, due to the announced border closings.My wife and I (both 68yo) have been planning and saving for this post-retirement trip to NZ for 3 years. Those of you who have similar plans will understand the enormous amount of time we've spent, researching and planning all things NZ. So rather than having wasted all that time and effort, in my email request for a refund, I asked my campervan rental company to retain their required amount for deposit, to be applied to the exact same dates, exact same campervan for rental in April 2021.To those of you here in the similar situation, let's please keep one another updated. And as I stated above... Let's actively promote those campervan rental companies whose outstanding business ethics and visions of a strong financial future prevail over those taking advantage of a situation that no one has any power to control in order to make a short-sighted, short-term buck... I know I will!"
Do you realize that New Zealand has now shut its borders to non-citizens and non-residents? https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-liv…
"Yup... See above... ""Obviously this is all moot, now, due to the announced border closings."""
"**I contacted the company where I have rented a certified campervan for the entire month of April 2020.** that's Wilderness is it? I have always highly recommend Wilderness, however given their poor response to the current crises and their meager 50% refund, I shall stop recommending them. And yes, I realise they obviously don't care."
Not justifying this at all. It stinks!However I think some of these smaller companies will be struggling to stay a-.float.
"#11 reply... No, Not Wilderness. I don't intend to name the campervan company I rented from at this point.#12... Yes, the entire situation stinks. And yes, business will suffer.However, please remember: ""The Government has unveiled a $12.1 billion support package for the New Zealand economy, with almost half of the cash to be spent on a wage subsidy package for all coronavirus-impacted businesses.Those full-time workers eligible for the package will receive $585 per week from the Government, paid in a lump sum package of just over $7000 covering a 12-week period.""If started immediately, that period of time covers NZ employees until mid-June. I have no info re: NZ campervan rentals in winter, but I'm guessing the number goes way down. (Please correct me if I'm wrong.)And now, the NZ borders are closed. No tourists may enter the country.I did receive an email back from the campervan co I rented from. I've asked for clarification... It appears to me that I am still eligible for:First... Their standard 30% refund if I cancel prior to 8 days of picking up the van. Absolutely no changes to refund policy, even though, through no fault of my own, I can't even go to NZ! Second... They will keep the entire amount of my payment to apply to my request for an April 2021 reservation. Not the standard deposit amount... The entire payment.Third... And I've asked that this be clarified. They will change my trip from 4 weeks to 3 weeks!Look, I realize that millions of people and business around the world are and will struggle during the invasion of this virus. But taking advantage of people because of it is absolutely wrong and underhanded.I hope I'm wrong, but it appears to me that the company I'm renting from is triple-dipping...1. Receiving financial assistance from the government.2. Keeping all my money unless I opt out for 30%.3. Reducing my trip length by 1 week. I absolutely intend to update this post, once my issue is clarified.."
I dont sse the connection between government support for wages and a refund of booking fees.
"We we planning to go with Wilderness for our upcoming - postponed - trip as well. To hear that they are inflexible definitely changed our minds.Would be good to know which companies are willing to refund due to the lockdown - if any.Edited: 9:34 pm, March 20, 2020 "
