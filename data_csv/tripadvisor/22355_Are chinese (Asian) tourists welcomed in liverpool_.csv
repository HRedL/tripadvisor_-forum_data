Will like to visit anfield stadium ...
"Yes, Tourists of any race, colour, faith or sexual orientation are welcome throughout the UK"
"Plenty of Chinese (Asian) people live here, so why would they not be welcome?Don't worry,"
Unlike some countries we aren't building a wall to keep certain people out
Really looking forward to visit the anfield stadium but just concerned abt the impact of corona virus on how asians will be treated ... guess I’m worrying too much ... YNWA
How would anyone know that you are a touristLiverpool is a very Cosmopolitan city and has a large Chinese community. There is a very large overseas student population. You will be welcome and almost anonymous.
"Really looking forward to visit the anfield stadium ??on the off chance you are approached and offered tickets for a game, think long and hard before parting with any cash. the tickets you may be offered are bound to be fake and you won't get in."
"""just concerned abt the impact of corona virus on how asians will be treated""After the big coronavirus outbreak in Italy, the realisation is now dawning in Europe that you can't assume whether or not someone has coronavirus by looking at their ethnic origin."
">>guess I’m worrying too much<<I would say that you probably are in terms of going to Anfield. As VegasShowgirl notes the Italian outbreak has made a great deal of difference to the lazier through patterns there.For the Anfield trip, they simply aren't allowed to discriminate due to your racial makeup which is all they have to go on - that could rapidly be a police matter."
# 3 Gratuitous swipe. Not helpful.
"#3 Also inaccurate. While the US is actually MORE welcoming of immigrants than the UK is, we actually both genuinely welcome genuine tourists of all ethnicities.Just try to get approval to live in the UK presently as a US national. Not happening."
"#3 appears to be a comment borne of hatred and ignorance itself. Oh, the irony."
"But there is a wall, isn't there?"

"Just another pathetic attempt at a dig at America -- something that is not entirely uncommon in the UK forums, unfortunately. Sad, really … I've always considered the Brits to be friends, and yet there are a small contingent who seem to actively seek openings - even in a seemingly benign forum such as this one -- by which to disparage my country."
No walls in LiverpoolBut there is one in WallaseyCome one come all to LiverpoolWe will never turn you away And there are strong fond links between Liverpool and USA especially New York from the old days of the cruise liners sailing from Liverpool.Liverpool the pool of life !
Liverpool has the oldest Chinese community in Europe.
"Whoa. Chinese. Walls. The Great Wall. Liverpool. Viruses. America. More walls. Build that wall. Fish and chips. Egg fuyong. A wall. Yes, I am beginning to see a pattern here! Conspiracy revealed. I blame Jung."
"#3 Britain must be one of the few countries to constrain its people's free movement to live, work or study in europe. As to the poster you are welcome here."
