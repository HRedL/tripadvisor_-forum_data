"I'm coming with a little 4 month old to the North Shore of Kauai the first week of May - I'm hoping the excessive rain hasn't produced excessive mosquitos - are they at normal irritating levels, or is it an epidemic?Thanks!!Don"
"Hi SeattleDon,I'm not a Hawii local, but a Seattle local, so had to say ""Hello"". We just returned from Kauai. The entire time we were there (April 11-18) there was wind, a little more than normal, I guess. There were no flying bugs. We stayed in the South, but rode horses inland up North and had no problems. REI sells some natural stuff that I use on my kids, I don't know if it would be ok for a 4 month old, but maybe if you wore it. ..Also, REI sells kids clothing that has sunscreen/mosquito repellant in it so it doesn't go on your skin (again, they may not have anything for babies. . ) You could go the really old fashioned way and wrap the little one in some netting:-) Have a great time!!"
"We just returned from staying near Ke'ee beach. The mosquitos were definitely worse than we remembered from past trips, but not a problem on the beach really - just for hiking and outside activities at night. And, even then they weren't horrible. Since it's unlikely you'll do much of either with an infant, shouldn't be a problem. But, I would bring some child-safe repellent just in case. "
