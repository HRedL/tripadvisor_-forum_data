Just found this article which was quite an interesting read on how LV could change in the future due to covid 19. (No paywall on this link)https:/…
"Can't get to the article -- but I really wonder about the future of poker. Nine guys and a dealer sitting elbow to elbow. it will be a while till we get back to that, I think."
">>but I really wonder about the future of poker. Nine guys and a dealer sitting elbow to elbow. it will be a while till we get back to that, I think.<<Sporting events, concerts, trade shows, all no different. At worst it will be when there is a vaccine readily available for everyone, but I doubt all of those things are shelved that long??"
"“ No paywall on this link)”Unfortunately there is, at least for me ."
"If Universities and Professional Sports continue then you can bet gaming will be fine. Are healthy people around the world going to live in fear after the “all clear” is given? There could be a second wave, etc. but people will likely return to a degree of normalcy until that happens. There are hundreds of things that would be as risky as visiting a casino."
Interesting article. I feel older people will begin travelling before younger people again. I also agree with goodbeer I think either when a vaccine is ready in a year all events go back to normal including a casino floor layout. Temporarily it will be very different.
Link worked for me...interesting article ...
"There are certain things that just don't work in a casino environment. In the beginning less tables (gaming and dining) but that is fine as business will take a while to ramp up. As it does, things will be added back. You can't run a place and be profitable with half your former occupancy/customer base but close to 100% of your former expenses."
"It is going to change no doubt about that.1. It will be like the gym, wipes for you before you play and after.2. Machines will have to be further apart.3. Six handed poker and tables might become the norm.4. Can you get Covid19 through second hand smoke? I have seen nothing on this, but if you get it through respiratory coughs and sneezes, it seems possible to me. So will smoking be ban?5. Before when I was in the casino, I never thought too much about someone sitting close to me coughing up a lung. Now as an older person, I'm probably not hanging around.6. Will there be screening, temperature checks, coughing and other symptoms. Will the casino tell you that you have to leave? How will people react? After Paddock people were appalled at what he did, but got pissed off about security coming into their room and the extra measures that were taken to ensure it didn't happen again.If there is a vaccine developed that good be a good start, but what's the next virus that's coming around."
"Remember, the measures put in place after the terrorism on Oct 1 was not invasive. Wellness checks rarely happen, and in many places there was already security at elevators. You can't smoke, drink, eat through a mask and frankly that would be a security nightmare. Covering the face inside a casino just doesn't work. Measures like putting out wipes of machines, extra washing of hands makes sense. That I can see in the long term, and actually encourage it."
"I think face masks will be mandatory, except when eating and drinking, which will be only in specific areas (bar area and restaurants). Smoking might also be restricted to a bar area or restricted smoking area.Face masks are now required in Macau casinos, so they are a viable proposition."
"And Macau casinos are dead. The Chinese also know exactly who goes where in their country and SAR. Aside from that, the WHO currently doesn't recommend masks. The CDC used to not. In fact, here is the quote from them:CDC (Dr. William Schaffner) in March of 2020:""The only problem (masks), that's not likely to be effective against respiratory illnesses like the flu and COVID-19. If it were, the CDC would have recommended it years ago. It doesn't, because it makes science-based recommendations.""Therefore either the CDC has been completely incompetent for decades or they are only issuing new guidelines to give people a false sense of security."
"why you so worried mon.....“We have it totally under control,” Trump said on CNBC. “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”In the 11 weeks since that interview, the coronavirus has reached every corner of the globe. It has infected more than 500,000 Americans and killed at least 20,000. It has rewritten the rules of society, isolated people in their homes, closed schools, devastated the economy and put millions out of work"
"^^^^ How many weeks since Fauci screwed up with bad comments? He, in most eyes, is the real expert. I am doubting you were looking to Trump back then so why not blame the expert?"
I think Fauci is playing Monopoly pandemic edition and has a “get out hate free card”.
"If we are going to place blame, of course Trump gets some. However, either most people in every country were incompetent then or are deceiving us now. Possibly both. January 14, 2020(World Health Organization)""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel Coronavirus.""Janaury 21, 2020 in an interview with NewsmaxDr Fauci: ""This is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States should be worried about right now.""January 29, 2020 NPR: "" Worried about catching the Coronavirus? In the US, the flu is a bigger threat.""February 29, 2020 Dr. Fauci on the Today ShowToday Show Host: ""So Dr. Fauci, it's a Saturday morning in America, people are waking up right now with real concerns about this; they want to go to malls and movies, maybe the gym, as well. Should we be changing our habits, and if so, how?Dr Fauci: ""No. Right now at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change."" March 9, 2020Dr. Fauci: ""If you are a healthy young person, there is no reason, if you want to go on a cruise ship, go on a cruise ship"". CDC (Dr. William Schaffner) in March of 2020:""The only problem (masks), that's not likely to be effective against respiratory illnesses like the flu and COVID-19. If it were, the CDC would have recommended it years ago. It doesn't, because it makes science-based recommendations.""World Health Organization as of April 13, 2020(When to use a mask)""If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019 nCoV infection."""
"The scientific and medical experts still generally hold the view that wearing a mask does little more than social distancing alone in protecting the wearer from catching covid-19.But as they've learnt more about the virus it's become apparent that a significant number of people might be infected but be asymptomatic , i.e., they may not even be aware they are infected but while they are they can infect others. The recent shift in some quarters in the 'to wear or not to wear a face mask' argument is therefore about the protection it might offer to people other than the wearer. Wearing a face mask might not protect you from catching the disease anymore than just social distancing, but if you're already infected it might reduce your chances of passing it on."
"These masks will cause more harm than good. Hard to breathe with them, hard to hear people speak. If not cleaned or stored properly they could get mold spores. Some cause neck problems from being worn for a long time because they aren't supposed to be. Look, if people are six feet away your spit isn't reaching that far. If you are sick, stay home. Same thing I have been saying. Plus again conflicts between the agencies. One is right, one is wrong or maybe these experts don't know bleep. I know plenty of people who don't. Can't wait for the antibody test so this can be over with already. Probably half the country has had it by now."
"""Probably half the country has had it by now.""You may well be correct.A respected Cambridge professor (who has been heavily involved in analysing the UK Covid-19 data) said today on UK TV that he believes as many as 1 in 3 of the UK population may have already had the infection."
"I hope that is the case and most people never see symptoms. A vaccine isn't coming for months and we can't keep going on like this. Plus for the UK that it is now doing trials on chloroquine to treat C-19. I know Trump offered some to BoJo, maybe it helped him?"
"PnSfromLAThanks for putting together the timeline showing how the responses from all of our ""experts"" have changed over the last few months. Too many of these experts are holding their fingers in the wind to see which response will sell best at the time. Fauci, in particular, has been across the spectrum in his responses. I'm neutral on the issue of masks. I think that they may have some beneficial effect, but it is offset by the false sense of security."
"Masks are basically a security blanket or nitelight for adults. Unless you are in a medical setting you can't use PPE properly which means it has at best a negligible beneficial effect. Not worth it. If there was, I'd wear one."
">>>Can't wait for the antibody test so this can be over with already. Probably half the country has had it by now.<<Available today in San Diego, no referral required $75.Edited: 5:54 pm, April 13, 2020 "
Available in OC too.https://covidclinic.org/#about
"Why would anyone take seriously PnS about anything when he said, and stands by this?""When thousands of young, healthy people are dying in a month in each state, then call it a pandemic.""Then he tries to get out of jail by saying ""He's not a doctor."" Yeah, neither is almost anyone else here, but we all seem to get it,"
"Thanks Goodbeer. Really appreciate that, I hadn't heard about the rollout. Going to do this asap."
"Fyi just called LA County Dept. of Health, testing isn't rolled out to the public yet, just 1,000 preselected people. Was told to check back in 2-3 days. When I can get one set up, I'll let everyone know as I am guessing this is the same in most major cities."
"I gave you the link, you can drive to OC and get one today. Its a private physician not through the county. No referral and no appointment needed.Edited: 6:51 pm, April 13, 2020 "
Did not see the link. Thanks!
"So maybe anyone that wants a test can get one, and they are beautiful ...finally"
"blxidave, everything good that you mentioned. But, look at your point #2. "" 2. Machines will have to be further apart."" That needs to be done. I hope that casino owners take a good look at their floor plan. If they decrease number of slot machines, they will tighten up the slots big time. But, they must do something about the distance between slots."
"Distancing at the slots is a start...But how do,you monitor social distancing at the casino floor bars? And more so, the nightclubs etc.or the restroom, every other urinal out of order? And even that wouldn’t adhere to 6 feet apart ...will be very interesting to see how this plays out"
"I know we have different health care systems but you basically sneeze and you can get a free test here. This is to see if you have it or not, we don’t have the one to see if you have had it in the past yet. Our population density is for sure helping this not spread in Canada. https:/…covid-19-testing-in-alberta.aspx"
"Raise resort fee another $3 per night, include paper masks."
