For obvious reasons our concerns have grown about our upcoming trip. Boyfriend and I planned to visit for the first time this month from the 21st to the 25th. It’s his bday. Our plans for sports events are now cancelled which is fine but family and friends are advising us to cancel as the city is a ghost town. I can’t rely on advise from people who don’t live there so besides crowded events are businesses closing earlier than usual or even closed all in all? I’m just getting anxiety because we still very much want to visit and hope Chicago is still welcoming visitors. Coming from Los Angeles. Thank you.

"At present, it's business as usual, except that events like the St. Patrick's Day Parades and sporting events are cancelled. Restaurants, bars, museums are still open (I noticed plenty of beer deliveries on my rounds today). What remains to be seen is whether entertainment venues like the big theaters, opera house, symphony center that seat thousands will be required to close.However, it's a rapidly evolving situation and what is true today may not be next week."
"As CV said, the situation is so fluid (everywhere, not just Chicago), it's impossible to predict the situation 2 weeks from now. In NYC, the Met Museum and major performance venues (Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, and the Met Opera) all just announced that they are closing. It's quite possible that, 2 weeks from now, Chicago will have followed suit. If the weather is nice for your visit, that may not matter, but if it rains every day, you may regret having come here if the indoor cultural attractions are closed."
"A ghost town? Where are your family and friends getting their wrong information? We had lunch at Water Tower Mall yesterday and shopped at Macy's. We just returned from lunch at Le Colonial (great Pho only $10) and the place was full. The streets had a decent population. Events gathering 20,000 people or more are cancelling. It is just wise to cancel a convention of 50,000 people from 100 countries. Our next Opera is April 11 so haven't heard about that. Movie theatres are open, Broadway in Chicago (legit theatre) has no intention of closing it's theatres as of today. Tickets are on sale. As CultureVulture notes; it's a rapidly evolving situation but as of today it's business as normal.How about us coming to LA? Should we cancel at this point? The west coast seems to have its hands full with this virus. We're definitely not going to Oakland or Seattle.Edited: 2:33 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"I just got in from Michigan Ave and it’s as far from a ghost town as you can get. I needed new boots, Nordstrom’s was busy, had lunch, everything normal and busy. Just monitor the situation but whoever your listening to, you might want to stop listening to them."
Downtown is the same as always. Some people are working at home but you can't really tell a difference.
"Your mayor was just on CNN advising not to travel international and domestic. Perhaps you should heed your city government’s warning. To top it off, Disneyland just closed out there."
"According to this evening's new conference by the Governor, Mayor, County President, et al. all ""planned"" gatherings of 1000 or more are banned for 30 days from today. This includes things like concerts and shows. It doesn't include airports or train stations.The Art Institute announced it is cancelling ""programs"" but will remain open. Programs includes things like lectures, maybe gallery talks, kids' activities.Edited: 7:11 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Why take the chance? This changes hourly. I would postpone. What if flights stop and you can’t get back? Could happen. Who thought a week ago we would be where we are now?
"Gatherings of 1000 people or more are banned. Unless, of course, they are children. My child's school has more than 1000.."
"Well, this is happening so fast! We’re finding out a lot of answer less than 24 hours after asked it. The Lincoln Park Zoo just announced that it is closed through mid-April. Maybe you’d better stay home. Personally, I wouldn’t want to be in an enclosed environment with recirculated air like an airplane.Edited: 11:32 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Oh man. Thanks for all the input. Things are rapidly changing so who knows what’s gonna happen next week. We have decided to just leave our options open. We don’t have to decide until the very last minute so...the other only thing that is keeping us from cancelling is that we’ll be staying at the Loews (bf works for the chain and gets the ultimate employee discount) and even if museums and other places close, we can still enjoy our hotel and just out to restaurants or what not."
"Maricela, yes, you have to live your life. You can always come, hang out by the pool, walk the lakefront, etc. They are saying “non essential” travel is discouraged, so just keep monitoring. GL."
Hoping it stays open for a possible middle May trip....
"More and more venues are closing, even after previously stating they would be open. To avoid a wasted trip, it's best to check their own website before heading to any one of them."
Now the schools are closing.
Shedd aquarium is closed
"Some restaurants are closing too. We got an email from Trattoria 10, in the Loop, that they are closing — presumably because so much of their trade consists of pre-theater and business dinners. I would expect that restaurants in areas with more of a residential base are more likely to remain open."
"""I would expect that restaurants in areas with more of a residential base are more likely to remain open.""Until they close permanently b/c so many people are furloughed they can't afford to eat out anymore...."
"And, how safe is it to eat food cooked by a stranger?"
We cancelled. I’m sad but Chicago isn’t going anywhere and we rather go when everything goes back to normal so we can fully enjoy it without being worried. Thanks.
Those of us who live here can take our wonderful city for granted. We need visitors like you to remind us how lucky we are. Please reschedule.
"Happi, regarding your post 20 -- ""how safe is it to eat food cooked by a stranger? -- the Trib has an article on that today, https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c… You can read it yourself but the general takeway is that, if you are not in a high risk group, it may be safer than usual since most restaurants have adopted extra measures to ensure sanitary conditions. The comment in that article (by a Rush clinical dietician) makes sense to me: ""“If you always thought a place was seedy, then maybe now is not the time to go to those places,”"
"Maricela, you made a smart decision. We look forward to seeing you later in the year.We just cancelled a trip to San Diego for the end of April. The impetus for the trip was a professional conference that my husband was to attend, which got cancelled. There was an interval when we considered going regardless that the meeting was cancelled but, as the situation evolved, we decided that it was wiser to just stay home. UA made it easier to make that decision by changing its policies to waive change fees as to reservations that were made before March 3. At this point, our only non-refunded costs of the cancelled trip are tickets to a Padres game; but, if the suspension of MLB games continues to late April, we will get those back too.Edited: 2:30 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"MBA, Several years ago, I was going to a third world country and asked my physician if I should get a Hep B shot. I was told, “even if you eat out at Chicago restaurants you should get a hep b shot”. The conversation went on that kitchen personnel cough, sneeze in kitchens, bus boys pick up dishes with germed hands, dishwater is often not hot enough, barbacks often just rinse beer and wine glasses. My takeaway is you have to live your life and enjoy yourself but I listen to my doctor, not a Tribune article. Btw, I am biased as I think the Trib is a terrible paper. On another note, if the games are back in business, sell your tickets on Stubhub."
"Happi, I hear what you are saying about going to restaurants. I'm not planning on going anywhere. Apart from whether the food will expose one to the virus, if we all frequent restaurants & bars, it may defeat the whole purpose of the social-distancing that is intended to slow down the spread of the virus. See this article from today's NYT, https:/…On the tickets, yes we will sell them on Stub Hub. Although, personally I am doubtful that MLB will be up & running by late April. Stay well."
"MBA, I can’t read your link to get past the paywall, but I saw the headline. I also was out today on essential errands and there are younger people all over in green at the bars. I was surprised to see that. Social distancing matters. I’m even social distancing from my family. I’m making everyone just go in their rooms on devices."
"Surprised you cannot get past the NYT paywall, as it's suspended for their coronavirus-related reporting. But evidently the NYT isn't waiving the paywall for opinion pieces.The St P Day pub crawls in Chicago were among the items identified in the article. The gist of the article was that, if the US populace doesn't voluntarily comply with the social-distancing recommendations, we will be facing the same issues as Italy -- both in the scope of the spread of the contagion and drastic lock-down measures to deal with it."
"I was also out today Happi (Our neighborhood grocer told us that they were rationing fresh food availability) and was surprised to see people lined up to be carded at Pippin’s and Streeter’s. Aren’t younger people paying attention, didn’t they get the memo or do they just not care? I think that the regulars here are doing a great job of keeping our posters updated. What has happened in the last 78 hours is almost shocking.Edited: 6:29 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"“Youth is wasted on the young”...they just don’t care. Plus, when you are younger, you never think anything will happen to you."
Picked up my daughter at Loyola today. Very sad day. I was also surprised at the students I saw out & about dressed in green & out to party. I feel bad for their parents that will be picking them up at some point and will be subjected to maybe something. Stay safe out there!
Sounds like nothing can stop the bar crawlers and party people in Wrigleyville.https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
"But the bars remain open. So people will go. We need to shut down all bars, restaurants like Europe is."
