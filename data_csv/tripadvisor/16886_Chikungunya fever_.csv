Have recently read that in 2006 and this year there were several outbreaks of Chikungunya fever in India including Kerala.It seems there is no vaccine against it and although not fatal certainly sounds very unpleasant and can be debilitating for anything up to a few months after contracting it. I gather all you can do is to try to avoid getting bitten by mosquitos which are the carriers. I would think it is pretty impossible to do that but can anyone give me advice as to the best ways to try to reducethe risk of getting bitten. Is Kerala(Kovalam) a particularly bad area for mosquitos? Would it be worse in the backwaters? Would it be worth investing in a mosquito net for sleeping at the hotel or do they provide them? Many thanks for any info.
AFAIK the epidemic is over in Kerala.
"Chikungunya fever, is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic lossChikungunya fever in IndiaTill 10 October 2006, 151 districts of eight states/provinces of India have been affected by chikungunya fever. The affected states are Andhra Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Delhi.More than 1.25 million cases have been reported from the country with 752,245 cases from Karnataka and 258,998 from Maharashtra provinces. In some areas attack rates have reached up to 45%. Prevention and controlNo vaccine is available against this virus infection. Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:* Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs;* Use mosquito coils, repellents and electric vapour mats during the daytime;* Use mosquito nets â€“ to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoes.* Mosquitoes become infected when they bite people who are sick with chikungunya. Mosquito nets and mosquito nets and mosquito coils will effectively prevent mosquitoes from biting sick people.This year, 2007, saw many cases but not as many as 2006.Some, but not all, hotels supply mosquito nets, These will often be in bad repair so if you are worried then either take one or but one there (cheaper).The chances of getting chikungunya fever at this time of year are very slim as it is more common during the rain saeson when there is alot of stagnant water about. You should have no trouble on the backwaters.I have been India 14 times and have had no problems. I now help run and finance a children's home 5.5km from Kovalam. If you would like to visit then please let me know.Hope this helpsRegardsPaul"
