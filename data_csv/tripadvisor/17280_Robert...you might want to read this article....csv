Robert...I know this is all too familiar to you...but a very interesting article...…yahoo.com/s/…dengue_epidemic
"Thanks, Judy. It is an interesting article and I know the subject from personal experience, too well!"
"I think ""Everyone"" would be interested in this story......Folks that are traveling to other countries really need to start paying attention to this growing problem, and need to take measures to help avoid it....Thanks Judy."
"Funny, you mentioned that. I was just thinking about Robert's awful experience when I responded to another mosquito thread. If I recall, he said the one that bit him was in the daytime however. I will read the article and perhaps it will have additional hints. "
Robert...how are you feeling...I should have been asked in the original posting. Sorry... 
"Finally, I am feeling good. The doctor said I was good as new but I am not sure of that!! "
