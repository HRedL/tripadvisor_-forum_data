"We’re headed out in mid April also. Going to Amsterdam-Bruges-Paris. Planning on going now unless they cancel flights or start travel bans, kind of excited at the possibility of going and experiencing less crowds!"
"I'll wait to see if anyone can tell me who is the ""new"" resident troll on the forum. I suspect most people won't be able to figure it out and will respond as usual."
Due to leave tomorrow (March 7) for Paris on spring break with our 3 kids. Unless there is a travel ban put in place we will arrive in Paris Sunday morning. Have been to Paris only once before. It will be interesting to see how/if this virus has affected the crowds at tourist sights.
We're a family of 5 and we plan on proceeding with the vacation as planned barring anything extreme. We're set to leave Monday evening but we're are prepared and will use extra caution.
We are supposed to travel April 1 with our grandchild; we are elderly but in good health. We are waiting a couple more weeks to decide but one factor is who is best likely to handle the illness if we contract it --- I don't have much confidence in the US medical care system at the moment.We have the concern about our age and vulnerability; we don't have worries about quarantine and such since we are retired and we are staying in a friend's apartment hence don't have a hotel issue.
** I suspect most people won't be able to figure it out and will respond as usual. **@FM: You were right on the money thus far.
"Is ""she"" back? With clothes on, I hope. Or is this a totally new entity?"
"I’m playing wait and see for my mid May trip to Paris and London. Thankfully hotels at both locations are fully refundable, however flights are not."
I’m doing the same Solo! Leaving mid May to London then train to Paris. I haven’t booked hotel but when I do they will be refundable bookings. Planning on going unless things get really bad or airlines step in and cancel.
"@Roxy, I am too scheduled to travel on Eurostar train from Paris to London, those tickets are also non-refundable as of right now."
I see our troll's comment has been removed.
"We are leaving on the 24th of March, and as of now planning to go as usual. If I could get refunded for the airbnb and flight I would cancel though."
"My husband and I arrived CDG Thurs morning and have been in Reims since. From on the ground I can say it’s been a non-event. Our flight was 75% full leading me to believe maybe some cancelled/ postponed but many continuing with plans. I packed a tub of Lysol wipes and am wiping down all travel spaces, tables, phones, luggage handles etc as well as washing hands. There were people in masks at the airport- more than usual but nothing crazy- and CDG was packed. I will say since we left, cases have about doubled, but it’s my understanding they are concentrated in several “hot spots” around the country: none of which involve our travel plans. French are still greeting with kisses as well. I check CDC once a day and State Department and neither have suggested changing plans. Our biggest concern is quarantine or closed borders, not catching. Good luck with your decision. I know first-hand it’s not easy."
"Unless they evacuate Paris, or cancel the Eurostar, I'll be there in a week."
"Mid April and I’m also a “wait and see” person. Airbnb is a 5 day cancellation, so I will most likely be deciding exactly 5 days before."
"Flying out mid April too, Paris-Germany-Netherlands-UK. Taking a wait and see attitude for now. Hoping for the best, but will make a call 2-3 days out to secure refunds where possible, if necessary. I’m doing an ‘inventory this weekend of all the places / things we pre booked to see which ones will allow changes/refunds and which ones won’t. I bought travel insurance thinking I wouldn’t have to worry if for some reason the trip was canceled - silly me, the underwriters outsmarted me again by excluding pandemics."
We're an early April trip and will go unless there's a travel ban.
"We’re supposed to leave March 28, Right now waiting to see what happens. My uncle, a doctor, who was just tapped to be an expert lecturer in NJ on the coronavirus (to whom, I’m not sure - this came from my dad) apparently said we shouldn’t go. But he also said it’s not as deadly as the flu. So mixed messaging."
"The virus can be deadly to those 60 and over and/or have underlying health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, etc. It can kill and has killed those younger than 60, but not as often as those 60 and older. They have found that young children aren't affected so much.Edited: 2:22 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Hmm, supposed to flying in to Paris in late June, fly out late July after doing a big circuit around Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and back into France. I strongly, sadly and unprofessionally predict COVID-19 will have taken off all over Europe by then, probably all around the world really. Would dearly love to be proven wrong. Luckily we can cancel everything with minimal losses, well, happy to lose $1K if need be, not too big a deal. But thinking, even if Disneyland Paris is a no-go for our young daughter, and if our week chasing the Tour de France around the French alps does not eventuate, maybe we will still go to most of our planned smaller towns and venues and just enjoy the European scenery. Will see how it plays out, but the prospect of a month touring Europe with facemasks on and being nervous about every restaurant and public toilet we visit does not sound like fun. Stay safe and healthy everyone..."
"Unless France bans international travellers, I'm there in early May."
"Aren't face masks only really effective for those who are ill - to limit the possible ""spray"" distribution of a mist of infectious droplets?I understand that once ""aerosolised"" the virus is carried on the resulting vapour and will get through the gaps between face masks and the face, unless they are fully-enclosed, breathing-apparatus style masks - the kind worn by those in constant contact with infectious patients.Proximity seems to be the major risk factor - face-to-face or by surface contact - because it exposes the uninfected to the effects of droplet distribution.Careful personal hygiene - more frequent handwashing and avoiding hand-to-face touching - seems to be the best defence. Maybe wear travel gloves on public transport? Along with a robust health profile that can withstand seasonal flu. If I had diabetes, a heart condition or compromised lungs or these conditions plus advanced age, I'd be staying home. Otherwise, it looks to me as a layman like approximately the same level of risk. The unusual aspect seems to be how easy it is to get the disease - and end up with a bad flu-type illness. But lots of people hang in through a bad cold (maybe even a flu, which is a different thing) when on holiday.If I was uncertain about my health, I wouldn't go before asking a doctor for an assessment. And if cleared, then I'd just take care.Edited: 6:49 am, March 07, 2020 "
Family of 4 scheduled to leave on the 19th. Wait and see as everything is changing daily. My husband is more concerned than I am. We are supposed to fly into Paris early 20th and hop on a train to Luxembourg on the 22 then back to Paris on the 26 to fly back to Fl on the 27. One thing we may consider if it gets too big in France is catch the train on arrival (20th) to Luxembourg. First time in my life I book non refundable hotels and go figure.... At least my sister lives in Luxembourg so no loss there in terms of hotels if we fully had to cancel everything. My biggest loss would be the opportunity of spending time with her :(. Hoping and Praying we can still go. Like others I have no fear of catching it. My fear is being stuck and or quarantined.
"For someone who picks his nose as much as I do, it is impossible to keep the hands off the face."
"I think Carolette has it in a box - it's the quarantining that would seriously wreck things for the usually healthy, more than the illness itself. If I were stuck with just two weeks leave a year, two weeks in quarantine would really be the dizzy limit. Not everyone has an entitlement to sick leave to cover such eventualities - some of us can apply for sick leave to replace recreation leave when illness strikes while we are supposed to be refreshing ourselves."
@carolette we are scheduled to leave on the 14th and that is our fear too. The illness is in so much the fear but being stuck somewhere. We are only in Paris for 3 days before we go to London we just have to pray to get out lol.
Scheduled to fly in late March. We’re still in “wait and see mode”.Leaning towards rescheduling because I’m slightly over 60 and my wife has a compromised immune system from rheumatoid drugs.
"** For someone who picks his nose as much as I do, it is impossible to keep the hands off the face. **K2, Perhaps, this is the propitious time for entrepreneurs to come up with disposable picker to make things safer for you during this horrid outbreak."
Been in Asia since December 8th...not going home anytime soon.. I fear a lot more from the panic than the virus.
"** I fear a lot more from the panic than the virus. **Well said. In fact, panic weakens our immune system and make it more vulnerable."
"I’m planning to cancel only if our Ministry of Foreign Affairs advices to avoid un-necessary travel to France. In that case I should be able to get my money back through travel insurance. If that doesn’t happen before March 28th, I’m going to fly to Paris for three nights and then continue to Amsterdam."
"From the US CDC:This will change daily, most likelyType of alerts:https:/…travel-notice-definitionsTravel advisory for Francehttps:/…"
"If the CDC is as reliable as the FAA, I would not pay much attention to them."
"I'm scheduled to fly out on March 30, so I'm very much in ""wait and see"" mode. As others have said, I'm not as much concerned about catching it as much as I am about the possible quarantining I might get stuck in. I'm checking for any travel restrictions daily, and so far, the US has not issued any for France. If there are none before I leave, then I'm planning on going. The good news is that with Air France offering cancellations/postponements with fees waived and my hotel being a cancellable rate, I feel like my monetary risk is low."
"K, thanks for the snark. It's always helpful in these types of discussions."
"Europe in general - there is no travel advice against travelling to France (or other EU countries, except northern Italy), but... I work in the EU programmes, we usually have a lot of meetings all over Europe. Most (if not all) have been cancelled. I should be in Brussels on Monday and there's big no. The EU treats it as force majeure. The same thing regarding the students' mobilities (like Erasmus+ and other grants). But decision is yours.Edited: 12:51 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"#34 Mickey M if going by your profile pic is accurate you look healthy and young. To you it's not a big deal. But to others who are older and/or have compromised immune systems or preexisting health conditions panic can set in. We're trying to be calm my husband and I, but we are extremely concerned as we fall into those same groups that need to be cautious. Right now we live in a region and a city that are experiencing more coronavirus patients and victims. My husband's workplace like many others nowadays have concerned employees who are trying to get approval to work from home. So good for you and others who feel no panic, but it's serious to others."
"I had planned on leaving for France on March 14 with my wife and my elderly parents but will likely cancel. I'm not so much afraid of the virus itself (in my 30's with no health conditions), but I am afraid of any possible quarantine. Original plan was to go to Peru/Argentina 2 days after coming back from France. With the situation in France getting worse, there's a very real likelihood of not being able to make it to Peru/Argentina due to a possible quarantine. Since South America is higher on my priority list, I'd rather cancel France than South America. Also, the fact that my parents are 70 and 80 years old doesn't help either. What sucks is that I booked the flights using a third party online site and hotels with Hotwire, so I'll likely have to eat the $2000 that I've already spent unless someone has advice on any refund/reimbursement."
"I canceled plans to travel to Italy first, then canceled Plan B for a London vacation, then canceled Plan C to go to New York City. Two big concerns about sharing air in a plane with a bunch of other people: contracting the virus and transmitting it to my immunocompromised husband upon my return, and causing upheaval for those at home (church, the school where I teach, etc.) should I end up having been in a group that was exposed. Getting quarantined far from home is a third concern. For me, I need to wait."
"We.re in wait and see mode as well, due to go out on eurotar ,so that will probably be ok,as can hopefully change dates,but hotel was non refund,so will only cancel if advised to do so, So can hopefully claim it back on insurance"
"#42:Yes.One has to think about individual circumstances. My wife and I are booked to be in Paris 4/20-4/27.. Not too long ago we would cavalierly have said “we’re going.” After all, our run of seven visits to Paris started May 13, 2016 — a show of support six months after 13 November. We’re not averse to ignoring the noise.“Left bank” types in previous visits, we have been reinvigorated in our planning with an apartment reserved in the Third and ready for a whole new approach to such a dynamic city. Except now my wife is a kidney transplant patient and her clinic advises against international travel (and limited US travel).So we are standing by. We want nothing more than to take this April trip. But we are maturely realistic. We appreciate that Air France and Air BnB have policies that will allow us to re-book for October if need be with minimal financial loss. We are fortunate that we have a couple more weeks to decide."
"Hamlet478, so sorry about your wife. I hope you both will get to enjoy Paris again."
"We're scheduled to go to Italy April 24th and are going as long as the plane still takes off!Edited: 10:48 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"I'd like to say 3, but actually 2. I'll be traveling with my daughter late June and we would still like to go, but I am also a carer for my other daughter and if I have to quarantine on return and stay away from her, and my other family, longer it might change things. The kicker is that the daughter I am taking already had one trip to France cancelled last year and I am desperate not to do it to her again."
I'm supposed to be leaving in a couple of days to London then Paris and I want to read what others are saying... that is why I joined Trip Advisors. Still trying to figure out if I should cancel. Please keep it coming.
We were due to fly to South Korea on 6th April for our son's wedding but that is now looking unlikely due to travel bans for SK. We were then heading from Seoul to Paris via Singapore. So I guess we could just cancel the SK leg and change our flight out of Perth to connect with the Singapore flight to Paris on 22 April but as we are early 60s we think it is best to stay at home for now and go another time (we have been to France a couple of times). Still no clear word from SIA about being able to get a refund on our non refundable tickets and amazingly they are still sending us changes to our itinerary (due to some flights being cancelled and merged with others) when in reality if we did go to SK and tried to come home or onto Paris via Singapore we couldn't due to Singapore's ban on anyone coming from SK. It is simply crazy that SIA seems to be continuing to take travellers to SK when they may not be able to return via Singapore.
"#42 Lucy, I agree and apologize if i came off insensitive. Of course those who fall into that groupcdo need to be extra cautious. Even younger people do. Maybe less so for themselves and more for spreading it to anyone let alone loved ones on that group. I can fully appreciate your concern, hope you stay healthy and can travel again soo"
"Michelle, we are closer to cancelling now. I was on the phone to Lufthansa today, and because we booked on July 1 2019 , we have virtually no room to reschedule ( 2 weeks ) because we would have to return by July 1. We were going for ten weeks . It then snowballs with car lease and accommodation as we still have to travel for the same length of time to get the waiver of free re booking. It is crunch time now in the next couple of days. If we cancel, we get the taxes back on flights, some of the car and some of the accommodation. We are very sad, but at 65 and 66, we are being cautious. It is more about disruption if the France imposes restrictions as Italy has done, or the added stress if we caught it. We feel we would not be relaxed and on edge every time we sneezed. I think we will cut our losses and look to the future. Not a very happy house to night."
"phirhon, I am so sorry that you are cancelling because I know how long you have been planning and looking forward to this trip, and also how much money it is likely to cost you if you don't go. But I very much understand why you are coming to this conclusion. We too are most unlikely to stick our plants for our France trips this year because of the virus, as we are 74 and 67. Of course in our case we are not far away, and the financial loss of cancellations is very small compared with yours.Best wishes."
"Thank you Celestina. We are very disappointed but I think you feel vulnerable when you get sick or run into issues so far from home. I am not so much worried about catching it, but feel the chances of disruption are increasing. I must be getting old!!We will return to France,. Maybe not this year but certainly next. Now to get our camper ready and do some travelling at home. Not France, but we will still enjoy it. Stay safe."
"Definitely, go. And if you die, tell everyone in heaven about the trip. =0>"
"It really is not obvious to decide what to do since there are so many unknown variables. My trip is in 3 weeks and I keep my fingers crossed.If I was planning a trip in rural France driving around to visit, I would not hesitate because in those kind of trip, I usually have fewer contacts with fewer people. But this time around I will mostly be in Ile-de-France so a much more urban area.I'm not really affraid to catch it. It's more about the restrictions and new health regulation that can arrive regarding my arrival and departure time. For now those are impossible to know. And my returne being 5 weeks after my arrival anything can happen during that time.But there is also no way to know how will be the situation in 3 or 6 months from now since that virus will probably continue to be around for a while. So I don't see the point of delaying my trip for so little difference in time. It would also be a lot more difficult for me to manage to find time to leave later in the year.At this point France is not on the list of places to avoid so there are little possibilities to recover all the money I paid for my lodging. And I've paid my plane ticket with credit card points so it's also a little bit more complicated for refund.So there are more chance for me to go through with my trip at this point. I only hope I will be allowed to enter in France and that they won't close the borders and/or airports. Which I doubt but in such situation anything can happen.Crossing my fingers really hard that they will find a way to control the propagation of this virus."
"It’s very tricky to decide. If the situation in France today is akin to the situation in Italy a month ago, is seems quite possible France will be in the same situation in a month as Italy is now. I’d like to think otherwise, but my gut tells me that in a month it won’t be easy to be a tourist in France. I have a limited time to cancel plane tickets on favorable terms (due to a death in the family yesterday which would be covered by trip insurance if we cancel within 72 hours) but I wish I could wait and see what happens in the next few weeks since no one had a crystal ball. If I wait, it appears Delta might allow rebooking within a year of ISSUANCE date which isn’t helpful - we booked our April trip last June to get good rates. So I’d have to rebook travel before June or the tickets are lost anyhow. Rats."
We're a family of 4 and leaving on the 13th. But I'm canceling and eat the cost. There's too much uncertainty. Paris will always be there.
">>#57: .. tell everyone in heaven about the trip<<Slightly OT but I can’t help thinking: if TA had a forum for Heaven, it’d only be a matter of time before someone started a thread titled “Is Heaven safe?”"
"Latest word out of France is an expected Level 3 alert soon to come, similar to Italy.Edited: 6:14 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Planner, our reasoning is the same as yours. You know the sort of trips we do. We do not go to attractions that get hundreds of tourists every day. We have very little actual physical contact with other people. We are only staying in one village with a population of about 1000. The rest of the time we are in gites in the countryside. Because we self cater, we do not even go out to restaurants very often. Most of the areas we are visiting only have a couple of cases. One option we are considering is cancelling our first gite near Dijon which does have cases. We will only lose a couple of hundred euro deposit. We will book another in a different area and continue from there. Because we are going for so long we are hopeful it will slow down by then.We are still undecided."
What would a Level 3 alert entail in France?
We are due to fly on the 2nd April via Singapore into CGD. Still definitely going but the only concerns (like a lot of others) is if French authorities up the restrictions and suddenly insist on 'voluntary' isolation for 14 days because we transited through Singapore! Have plans already to head South of France the day after we arrive and this would definitely screw up the whole trip. If this is likely to happen we would need to plan now to maybe travel in on a different airline - feeling sorry for SIA at the moment.
What does Level 3 mean??
"The latest out of France is that they are banning congregations of people of a thousand or more. Obviously this has all sorts of flow on effects for sporting, cultural and entertainment events and venues all over."

I tried to describe the stage 2 and 3 on the official post about the Coronavirus on post #58 on page 6https:/…105932364@Phirhon. I'm with you with your reflection and pondering of all this. There doesn't seem to be that many cases around Dijon or being that alarming. Bourgogne-Franche-Comté is a large territory and a majority of cases are around Bourtzwiller (Mulhouse) where there was that religious gathering and in the Doubs department and Belfort from what I just read. But I think it's a wise decision to change your first gite if you're unsure.
https:/…france-travel-advisory.html
How was the travel? I leave next Friday and am curious for your experience with your family
"My husband and I are supposed to leave for Paris March 19 and then for Nice on March 27. We’ve contacted Delta who has given us the option of changing our vacation for another destination or canceling and rebooking within 90 days for travel up to 11months from now. We are in a wait and see mode, but are seriously considering cancelling or traveling elsewhere. Our main concern is getting quarantined. I don’t have unlimited vacation. In addition, my husband works as at a hospital with compromised patients so he cannot work remotely to ensure we don’t infect others. And it is very much a concern that even if we don’t get sick, we can still infect others around us while not showing any symptoms. We all have to make this decision based on our individual situations and comfort level. France is about to reach their Level 3 stage of the epidemic which is why they are cancelling large events and gatherings. Here’s a link that gives more information about what that is. https://www.en24.news/n/2020/03/coronavirus-… Best of luck all whether you decide to go or cancel."
"BonjourI think it is like advise you receive about bringing up babies, you do what you are comfortable with.With so much conflicting advice you make a decision based on what you are happy with.Arrived yesterday and apart from the odd facemask on planes, trains and people on the street ( not the first time I have seen this pre Carona) walking thru Immigration there are a few advise signs with what to look out for, but everyone is just breezing through."

"As of Friday, France meets all the requirements for Phase Three. The gov’t has decided to wait a few more days to call it as they rush to free up hospital beds by discharging as many current patients as possible, prepare military hospitals and recall retired military medical personnel. It is most likely Phase Three will be announced before the end of this week."
In the same boat. Perth-Singapore-Paris 1-2 April. Can only wait and see at this stage.
"Our trip is scheduled at the end of May, so we have some time still to make the call. If we have the flexibility to waive change fees (pretty sure travel to France doesn't yet qualify), we would have to travel before September because that is when we bought our flights. With one in college, we are confined to travel before mid-August. Like others, my main concern is getting stuck (and as others have said, I can think of worse places to be stuck) or attractions and restaurants being closed. Hopefully, there will be an upward trend before mid May... fingers crossed."
Mountpleasantmom some airlines like Delta and United have begun to waive change fees. You need to check with your airline.Getting stuck in Paris seems like a dream for me too. Except you need to be sure you're comfortable paying for accommodation and food for an indefinite period.
"The SNCF has waived all cancellation or exchange fees until the end of April, for anybody interested.If I were travelling to France in the coming weeks and already had hotel reservations; I would not hesitate to negotiate a reduction in rates. (""I'm sorry but I might have to cancel my trip...')"
"We cancelled a 2-week trip to France yesterday ... were scheduled to fly to Paris today. Though we are in a high-risk group (elderly), we are more concerned about what would happen if (when, according to many) France reaches Level 3, regarding travel restrictions, etc. And if we could return to the U.S. easily, we wonder what might be coming back with us. United has given us credit for our tickets, but, as of today anyway, will charge us a hefty exchange fee when we get new tickets.We believe our decision was the right one for us. It was made carefully with the information currently available, and we kept a wait-and-see approach for a long time. But the decision was not based on what other people would do. Generally, everyone’s situation is different."
Is the assumption that when France reaches Level 3 there will be some sort of travel restriction/quarantine? Does anyone really know what Level 3 might entail? We are supposed to leave for Paris this Friday and this is the part that has me most uneasy.
"Starting a 46 dayer first week of April. We were doing UK, France, Brussels, Vienna, Germany and end up Florence. Flying back from Milan. Were both retired and 60 but no health issues. Im mixing it up some as Italy pretty much out of picture. Paris was only a 3 day break as been there already. Flying BA and dont want to get ripped by them and some of the hotels. Heck the way its looking the US is going to get it so might as well harbor myself in some small village TBD. Ill either be on the plane or lose allot of money. Other factor is how long will this menace last where we hide in fear. Roll the dice......"
"Whats strange is our unbiased media does not tell us the recovery stats.IE 32 have it but 27 only for 3 days. Also the folks that are passing away what other conditions did they have , like John Doe had 4 lung transplant and Jane was on life support already with a DNR. Were almost self inflicting ourselves with the worst and this is far less as dangerous as other. It is a rapid spread virus but 80 to 85 % suffer more with the flu than this. My nephew in Seattle says it is mostly a 3 day cold but media does not say that. One day there be a real bad virus and ALL ages affected. They stated no cases on children under 9, not offered by media but ask my doctor and that was answer...."
It has never been hidden that 85% of people recover with absolutely no problems. The point is that it is extremely contagious and that the death rate is from 2 to 5% depending on the country.
"Health issues that make a person more susceptible to have complications and die are diabetes, heart disease, chemo patients, even high blood pressure (although not all doctors agree on this one). Any person with a compromised immune system in general is susceptible."
Flying back from Milan...?When in Rome do as the Milanos do run: https:/…1236432750103666689
Milan is no longer open to discretionary travel - work and medically necessary travel restrictions throughout Italy until the end of April.
"We have cancelled our entire trip which involved a 2 week period in Seoul from 7th April- 22 April, then a transit in Singapore and onward to Paris for 4 nights, pick up car and head to Loire Valley and then Brittany so mostly country travel like Phiron. The bans on South Korea put in place by Singapore meant that we wouldn't be able to transit for Paris unless these happen to be lifted by April. Australia also has issued a level 3 avoid travel warning for SK. We didn't want to go ahead and then find we couldn't get to Paris and the rest of our party couldn't get home, or had to self quarantine once home. We had the option of cancelling the South Korea leg of our itinerary and flying to Singapore from Perth on 22 April then on to Paris but as SIA as of 2 days ago offered waivers for cancellations for itineraries including SK we decided to take the opportunity and cancel the entire trip now rather than waiting another 4 weeks when perhaps this option would not be available. We lost $500 on our lease car booking but nothing on accommodation as I had booked refundable airbnb places for Paris and other accommodation was through friends and able to be cancelled. We may live to regret it if things are improved by the end of April in France but for now it was the best option and we can go to France next year. We will go to Seoul another time also, to see our son. To say we are disappointed is an understatement. We are so sad to miss our son's wedding in Seoul, which will now be a registry office affair with his partner's small family and a few of their friends. It is hard to know whether air travel is a big concern and how many people may have contracted the virus just by being on the plane with someone who is infected. We don't know all the details. But there is a woman in Perth who just tested positive. She returned to Australia last week, after time in Cuba, London and transiting through Dubai so goodness knows where she actually contracted the virus and who she has infected here. Time will tell if we get transparency in information from the authorities here.Good luck Phiron and others still going ahead with travel in France. i am sure it will be perfectly safe in country France, just as safe as here in Perth."
"We are in a wait and see mode for April 8th to Paris, car rental to Sarlat for a two week stay in the Dordogne. We are in our70’s, purchased medical trip insurance. Are staying in one location for two weeks and have an English speaking host. All indicators are that we will be fine. Unless something unusual happens. Good luck to you, I hope you are able to go on your dream trip!"
"Michelle- just read your post and I am so sorry you will be missing your son’s wedding. Make sure someone responsible is assigned to video the wedding on a mobile phone for you. I’m sure you will be dearly missed, but you can rest easy that you did the right thing for you. My traveling partner is my sister who works for an orthopedic surgeon. I’ve been harping on her to wash hands in between patients which she would do anyway. She is going to take an additional precaution in notifying all patients they should not come in if they are not feeling well. We hope to leave for a France on April 8th."
Do you know where you read this?
Plans for Paris on April 14 are wait and see.....
"Michelle, we are still in watch and wait. We will get some back and not much difference between now and in two weeks. Because we are going for ten weeks, we are hopeful by end of May early June it may be settling down. But who knows. The first two departments we will be visiting for three weeks in total have no cases at this stage. The airport in Singapore is the concern. I know how disappointed you must be. We will be very sad if we can not go., but will live with the decision we make."
We’ve just decided to cancel our trip - flying into Paris on April 8th; leaving out of UK on the 26th. Too many uncertainties with 2 kids and an adult with a bad case of asthma. We feel it would be better to be home in the event of a ‘lockdown’ or illness.
Can anyone point me to a map of France where one can see the number of cases distributed geographically? I'm sure there must be an official resource from the health authorities somewhere with a daily updated map but I haven't been able to find it.
"Trip is still on, arrive Paris from London March 14, fly to Edinburg on March 17. Unlikely things will change enough between now and then to cause us to change. BTW, interesting note, the average age of people in Italy dying from COVID-19 is 83."
"My girlfriend and I are scheduled to fly out of Philadelphia on April 12th. A couple of weeks in Paris then another 5 days visiting friends in Belgium. We're in our mid-sixties and pretty healthy. Knowing that this situation is probably going to get worse before it gets better, we're cancelling. Both our schedules are pretty flexible so hopefully returning late summer should be just fine for us. Just the idea of having to deal with a potential quarantine situation does not work under any circumstances."
"BTW, interesting note, the average age of people in Italy dying from COVID-19 is 83.————————————Does that mean it’s ok to spread the illness around the world? I’m hearing this a lot, it’s an “ I’m alright Jack” response. It’s now not so much ‘what’s safest for me’ but what we can each contribute to slowing the spread.If you can only look at it from a self interested perspective then you might feel it’s better not to fill up the available hospital beds with 83 year olds in case the rest of us need them. I’m not 83, although I have a parent in their eighties, and I’m not a fearful traveller - I visited Madagascar during the 2017 pneumonic plague outbreak- but I am inclined to feel that if I had a holiday planned in the next few weeks I’d be cancelling.Edited: 9:19 am, March 10, 2020 "
"Excellent point, Britt!"
@102Britt...excellent post...I see so many comments that sort of imply anyone of a certain age is well...expendable. this is all getting out of hand fast.
"On the train now to Paris and have no concerns at all, Paris have banned all 1,000 and over gatherings, as precaution, we must remember it is flu, wash your hands! It’s an amazing city and will do all it can to protect its citizens and visitors, perhaps the media hype here will be less negative!!"
"And if someone on the train or station or metro or cafe sneezes without a mask on, then there you are. This is a virus spread through the air; you wash your hands because the droplets coughed in the air settle on surfaces and that is another means of transmission. But someone in your metro car coughs or sneezes and you are easily exposed."
One if the things that I've heard about repeatedly is how much faster the Coronavirus spreads as opposed to the typical flu.
"It seems to me fairly obvious that the more an individual moves around the more chance there is of becoming infected. Of course Paris is a great city, but that doesn’t make the French politicians or scientists any cleverer than in any other city. Is there a logic in banning more than a thousand people being in a sports stadium but allowing 700+ people to use the train? That’s a genuine question to which I don’t have an answer. I’m pretty sure that the media being either positive or negative makes zilch difference to the spread of a virus.Edited: 11:24 am, March 10, 2020 "
"Hey Britt, are you suggesting all travel stop right now? Close France? Is that what you are advocating?"
"I have read that stage 3 is more relaxed than stage 2. When you get to stage 3, it means that the virus is everywhere and there is no longer any point in isolating people, so there is more freedom of movement.Of course, one's own precaution must be reinforced in such cases."
"Hey Britt, are you suggesting all travel stop right now? Close France? Is that what you are advocating?————-No, and my comments aren’t only pertinent to France, they apply to everywhere. Perhaps more so to countries which so far have had a less coherent approach to testing. Many of these threads are asking “what would you do” and I THINK my current personal decision would be to forego a holiday if it lessens the risk of the virus spreadIng. I completely understand that not everyone will feel the same."
I also agree with what you have stated brittraveller31. I too have seen many comments posted via social media that for the poster it's safe so what's the harm in traveling now. They ignore that there are others who are very vulnerable to this virus and can die from it.
"Option 2.May 20 is still a good bit out and hoping it all clears up..Edited: 3:35 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"We’re out. Just canceled, were supposed to leave Friday (March 13). Too many variables. We’ve got two kids in college and a senior in high school (she was coming with us). Some Universities are moving to online classes and sending kids home plus some area schools are closing. With things changing everyday it just didn’t seem like the right time to leave for us.We HATE it but we will get to Paris again someday! Safe travels everyone and stay well!"
I feel your pain 5onatrip
We leave Monday as well and plan to proceed unless there are any bans.
"Did you get refunds or have to eat it. We're leaving April on 46 dater, fingers crossed. We're hitting 6 countries originally"
"We're out, too. We are not willing to gamble thousands of dollars (to say nothing of our health) on such a fluid situation. At this point, almost everything for our planned April trip is refundable. We're out several hundred dollars for miscellaneous things, and we're heart broken, but we will survive this far better than the possible alternatives. Air France says there are so many cancellations, it will take at least 4 days to get our e vouchers."

"We got cheap tickets on British Airways months ago. Will lose our money on that unless their policy changes by Friday (we are waiting til absolute last moment to cancel flights in case they start offering vouchers or something). As of now, we will also lose a boatload of points that we used to book an apartment through Marriott (does not have hotel cancellation policy). So, yeah, it’s not the best situation but it could be much worse."
"We are supposed to leave Thursday night flying Aer Lingus and are leaning toward cancelling now. Aer Lingus is still enforcing the change fees and we have an AirBnB rental too that we are trying to change to a different date, but I don't know yet if they will let us. Would love to still go and were thinking that's what we would do, but now it's just looking so likely that things will start closing, restrictions will tighten, etc... We are getting down to the wire though now so we need to hurry up and decide. We are supposed to be in Ireland first this whole next week and then not arriving to Paris until Friday the 20th. That's another factor- I fear by this time next week it will all be that much worse."
"Following this thread (and one other) for my summer trip to Paris. I still have plenty of time to make changes without losing a lot of money.Edited: 9:17 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"We have a trip planned to Paris (five nights) and then on to Belfast (three nights) June 10-19. We have expensive airline tickets that are non-refundable that we booked a long time ago. Hotels and other expenses are refundable. We will eat the cost of the airline tickets if we don't feel comfortable taking the risk of traveling. Or if things get worse, I suppose airlines might cancel flights, and we'd get a refund. We are in a wait and see state. Ages of our party 59, 65, and 24. No one has health issues, but two of us are in the older age bracket. We have been planning this trip for about two years (rare European travel), bucket list trip for DS. We usually just travel domestically. It is what it is. A thread like this is nice for feeling that you aren't the only one in this boat. And canceling travel is not even close to being sick or having family members sick, being in quarantine, loosing family or friends. I'm sure no one with stocks likes what the market is doing now either. Prayers for all. There is a lot of time between now and June 10th (three months). I don't think this is going to go away though. Put us, though, in the wait and see camp."
"I was set to fly in 2 weeks, but I've decided to cancel. All my flights, excursions and hotels were booked. I'll have to see what fees I can redeem (vouchers, maybe?) and what expenses are sunk cost. If you asked me last month, I was going as long as the plane takes me, but I've just taken a look at the statistics and it went from about 250 (from February 28ish) to presently, 1784. Unfortunately, there's a trend with this virus. The numbers only increase and then government restrictions are set and enforced to prevent it from spreading. I'm afraid of the risk and issues that might come up while traveling between 3 cities in Europe. I’ll probably end up being more stressed out than enjoying. Super disappointing as I can sympathize with others cancelling, but I guess on a global scale, there are far more pressing matter related to it!Edited: 9:57 pm, March 10, 2020 "
My trip isn't until mid June so at this point I am a wait and see.I am scheduled to fly into Paris with a stop over at Qatar. Like many others my flights and accomodation are non-refundable in most cases as are our concert tickets in London. I still have time but selfishly I hope I can still go!
"AA has updated fee waiver policy today 3/10/20. If you have scheduled flights with AA (and I’m guessing with all partner airlines too) anytime before April 30th, in ANY city where American flies, you may change your booking ONCE for travel at a later date without change fees, fare difference still applies. Again, this waiver only applies to flights originally scheduled for March and April departures."
changing versus voucher is not much help as who knows when it will be safe to fly. This would be a good policy if one could receive a voucher for the full amount to be able to use the value later. We are hoping to go in the fall but committing to a specific time now is pretty hard.
"I feel like burying my head in the sand! The whole purpose of my 6 week trip was to go to the French Open. We fly Australia to Malta, Malta to Sicily and Turin then Paris. Fortunately we have time to extend our holiday as we are retirees and I don't want to miss out on my scheduled countries. Trying to find out the implications of flying Italy to France and monitoring it seems to be impossible. Travel insurance customer service is useless, their advice is wait to see if you are stranded or quarantined, then put in a claim. Most of my bookings are non refundable and so unless a country is banned to travel to or we are affected by delays we aren't covered. We have until May 11th, so two months away, but I would like to be prepared. I would like to know where we will go if we have to self quarantine and how do we get fed. I do have diabetes, managed with diet only and hypertension that is well controlled so I am not worried about my health so much. More worried about not having an enjoyable holiday and losing a lot of money. Unfortunately, I can't afford to cancel, there are too many restrictions with the travel insurance. So it's wait and see for us."
"I sure would not want to do anything with Italy right now -- not sure you could get out or in anyway. Local cases here at the moment have involved people returning from Italy.Australian travel insurance may cover quarantine etc -- US policies I know of including ours have clauses that invalidate the coverage in the case of epidemics and they are not covering anything -- cancellations, hospitalizations, evacuations if they are caused by the epidemic."
"Australian travel insurance is pretty much the same, Janettetravels... a lot of companies have left people in the lurch. There’s no reciprocal health agreements between Australia and France either so the possibility of getting sick and getting a huge bill looms as well.  I’m booked to arrive in France on May 23, and with the threat of possibly having to take unpaid time off work soon, healthy or not, on top of the possibility of medical bills in a foreign country, or accommodation for quarantine/isolation, I think I’m going to cancel my accommodation to at least give them the remote chance of rebooking it. I’ll lose my deposits:( and feel awful for cancelling but I think it’s for the best. I’ll hang in and hope I can rebook my flight or get some kind of refund if things go south. No summer in Paris for me this year:(  Good luck with your decisions everyone. Looking forward to visiting Paris again on the other side of this. Stay well."
We just cancelled what was supposed to be a long weekend in NYC. AA redeposited my miles and Hilton didn’t charge for cancellation even though we waited until the night before we were supposed to arrive.
"Hi AllHad a girls trip planned for end of May to Milan , just decided to be safe and reschedule, all set now for end of August. Actually the trip ended up being cheaper by around $400 PP"
"We were supposed to fly out on March 16. I am Emergency Room Nurse in the US and we just cancelled our trip Scotland/Ireland. My decision was based on:NOT the fear of Covid 19.One leg of our flights was cancelled.Reading CDC guidelines. All advisories say not to do unnecessary travel.The trajectory of cases are increasing.The fear of being stuck in a country or quarantined. Example,when they closed the boarders of Italy. I am not worried about covid but can't control how each county government chooses to contain it. Our infectious disease doctors recommended to not do international travel at this time. If I would get it, don't want to burden healthcare system that is already taxed.Reading local newspapers in the country and tracking closures of things that I really want to see.Being a nurse, it is the responsible thing to do, to not potentially get it and expose more patients. With all that being said, we cancelled and will try again at a later time when we don't have to stress about so many unknowns."
Cancelled paris_amsterdam_brussels trip later March. Not worth to go on a trip full of uncertainty and concern.
"lovefrance2 thanks for reading my post and understanding our disappointment. Our son is very pragmatic about it all and he knows we will visit another time as soon as we can. We will ask him to have one of his friends take a video and as they both intend getting dressed up and enjoying their day there will be photos. My niece was married in Dublin 2 years ago during the winter and she told her parents not to stress about getting to Dublin, she was happy with the registry office, her partner's family, her twin sister and good friends. We saw the photos, they were lovely. It's time to accept what it is and like Phiron we will be getting our camper trailer out of the garage and heading north when the weather here in Perth gets cool. You don't have a lot of close contact with lots of people when travelling in remote parts of WA so we should be safe!"
"Update from us- we are going tomorrow. Flying to Dublin but will be directly heading to western Ireland to stay with family. We have plans to be in Paris next week and we are planning to just monitor that situation and are aware that portion of trip may be called off. If we have to just stay around Ireland, we will, or may come up with a plan B if there is one that makes sense. It was too complicated to cancel and we couldn't get out of our flights/ lodging at this time. We also have no idea when it WILL be ""safe"" to travel again, and we have school aged kids and jobs and can't just take off for 2 1/2 weeks any time we feel like it. I guess my take at the moment is that this virus is everywhere... and no matter what I do, it is going to continue to spread. I feel that at this point we could contract the virus at home almost as well as anywhere else, so we will go, be as safe and smart as we can, wash our hands, follow the situation and try our best to avoid a situation where we will be stuck in quarantine or something. It is still technically a miniscule portion of the population that is infected overall, though I know the numbers seem scary on the news. Hoping for the best but also planning/ prepared for the worst I guess."
"So, now that you've made it to Paris, how are things? We're due to go in a couple of weeks and anxious to hear updates."
"I got a message from a friend of a friend this morning who is currently in Paris, and this was her message at 5:44 am CST March 11, 2020: ""Everything is open and the mood is good. At the Louvre you can only pay with credit card because they don't want you to touch the money There are people with gloves and masks. We have wipes and hand sanitizier and use both liberally. We have been to the louvre, Arc, l'Orangeries, Eiffel Tower and today we are at Versailles. Small crowds which is great! It is very calm and fine here currently. We are good and don't even feel like we are in any danger."" I am personally flying to Europe tomorrow but as I said not due in Paris until March 20th. IF we end up going to Paris, I will be sure to update this thread."
Thank you for posting!
"Flying in mid April, MAN-DUB-JFK. Still going unless it’s cancelled."
"Starting to look like we'll have to move our mid-April visit, only question is how far out. Curious how far out most people are changing to. I originally figured October but I'm not so sure."
Macron is scheduled to make an announcement tomorrow evening at 20h00.The guess is France will move from level 2 to level 3 with additional health protection measures. More schools could close as well as limitations initiated for public transportation.Details to come.
"Currently wait and see for us. Originally planned a week in Paris and Switzerland for the two of us. Scheduled to Fly April 10. Air France is offering voucher/rebook until May31. If the situation gets worse, might take the voucher. Don't want to make changes early in case things change(Hopefully for the better). Unfortunately, my Schengen visa expires May 7th, so a quarantine would be bad for us."
The US will most likely refuse entry to anyone coming from Europe.https://www.lefigaro.fr/sciences/2020/03/11/…
So are you going? We are arriving the 14th too. Trump is speaking tonight about Europe. Im concerned we cant get back into the US.
The US just suspended travel from Europe for the next 30 days.
To revise my last post the flight restrictions start Friday.
"We have made the difficult decision to cancel our trip. We were due to leave on April 2nd for ten weeks driving around France. As we are mid sixties , although in good health, we felt the risks were becoming too much . Australia does not have a reciprocal health agreement with France and the possibility of ending up in hospital or having severe restrictions on travel were too much. I know we are not alone in making this decision, but that does not ease the disappointment."
Thanks for the info! I’m not sure how this might impact those of us who decide to travel to Europe from the U.S. and coming home to the U.S.
Thanks for the info @quarantined and @sarastro! I’m not sure how the travel ban of people coming to the U.S. from Europe will impact those of us who decide to travel to Europe and what that might mean getting back in the U.S.
""" I’m not sure how the travel ban of people coming to the U.S. from Europe will impact those of us who decide to travel to Europe and what that might mean getting back in the U.S.""It should not come as a surprise that the airplane going to Europe would have arrived early from Europe .... and since there will be no flights into the USA from Europe there will be none going out as there is no way to get back in."
“...and since there will be no flights into the USA from Europe there will be none going out as there is no way to get back in.”I could be wrong but it is my understanding that US Citizens and close relatives to US Citizens would still be allowed into the US. So I don’t think there won’t be any flights between US/Europe. Planes will probably be mostly empty though. Anyone has any thoughts about this?
"There was no mention of the cancellation of flights from Europe to the United States. As U.S. citizens, U.S permanent residents and special exceptions are not banned, there will likely be some flights available. I am sure there will be much more information available soon."
CDC travel advisory is now LEVEL 3 for Europe. I believe this means that airlines can make refunds instead of changes and vouchers. https:/…coronavirus-europeThis is different than the Coronavirus level 3 which specifies what a country should do to deal with the virus (I.e. contain)
"For what it’s worth, noticed Air France cancelled 1 of 3 flights from LAX to CDG on March 25th."
Schools are now closed. Expect attractions and events to be closed soon for some time. That's what's happening in the U.S. Broadway theaters hove now shut down.https://www.thelocal.fr/20200312/macron-says…
Monday for closing schools.
"Need to add one more thing. With the saddest of hearts I am canceling our trip in May. I waited to see, and now see there really is no choice. I will return Paris, with all the love in my heart for you and your fine people."
"I'm leaving the US to Marrakesh, then Paris and London on March 17th.Everyone who was traveling with me canceled. My only concern is getting stuck somewhere in quarantine and end up spending a lot of $$$ with health certificates to get out of places.I'll make my decision a day before departure. :("
Does anyone know how far out Air France is giving refunds? We are supposed to go in late June for three weeks. Flying into Paris and taking a train to the south. Spending most of our time in smaller villages. We will be going unless our trip is cancelled or we may possibly cancel if we get refunds. It would be very devastating to be out a few thousand dollars for the flights and a few hotels. I think I can get refunded for about 3/4 of the places we are staying. This is very sad and I hope in three months time things are looking up.
"I'm 99% sure I'll have to cancel my trip leaving on April 14th. Still holding out as long as possible to cancel as BA's policies don't seem as flexible as some others.The fallout in the US has been massive the last 48 hours with Travel bans, schools closing doors, major sporting events cancelled. The company I work for just mandated everyone work from home for 2 weeks. Additionally if anyone travels outside the country in the next 30 days a working from home for 2 weeks will be required when returning. These policies are quickly becoming the norm instead of the exception. Only time will tell if the mass hysteria will have any impact on slowing the spread."
"Check Air France website. This morning it said they were giving vouchers for tickets purchased before March 31, 2020 travel to be rescheduled by May 31,2021. That said, I think now you may be able to get full cash refund after Trump’s announcement last night. If you decide to go, be prepared you may need to self quarantine for 14 days upon your return. If things aren’t looking up by June we will be in dire straights. Considering the circumstances, you may find hotels will be more flexible to refund you, at least that’s what we found after 9/11. Wish our plans for Paris/Dordogne were for June not April."

This non-refundable voucher is valid for 1 year on all Air France, KLM and partner flights.”This is what we and I’d suspect most plan to do. In my mind it’s a postponement but AF classifies it as a cancellation. https:/…Edited: 8:26 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Hamlet (and others) my apology! I misread the offer. Wishful thinking for sure!
"I'm supposed to fly to Paris in early April. American Airlines will not refund our ticket purchase so we are planning to go vs. lose $5,000 on two first class tickets. Unfortunately, I cannot use a credit or voucher before the date they require, so a refund is my only option and they will not do this."
"We’re due to arrive in Paris on April 7 . I intend to go if possible, but am also mainly concerned about closing of borders as we are also doing a trip to Morocco. Also Singapore has cancelled transit flights and although we return to Aus via Bangkok I am hoping we don’t have the same problem there in a few weeks time."
"April 7 is very soon. Last night Macron suggested France will be closing internal travel and borders in the days to come. These measures are being put in place to save lives. Why would you travel knowing it could actually kill somebody. At this point it’s kind of like drunk driving. Yeah, you probably won’t kill somebody, but it happens enough that society has said stop."
"British Airways has now changed policy to vouchers good for a year from travel date. Our flight leaves tomorrow but we have held off canceling-even though we knew we were not going-waiting to see if they would indeed offer a voucher or something.Naturally we canT get through to speak to a person, but we applied for a voucher online and said they would notify us in 48 hours. Oddly enough, we were able to apply for the voucher WITHOUT canceling the trip. We are afraid to cancel without talking to an actual person to verify that we will receive a voucher. However our flight leaves in 24 hours. Do we go ahead and cancel the flight?? (I realize this is an oddly specific question but maybe someone Here has dealt with BA about this?) Thanks for bearing with me through that ramble."
"Disregard previous post! Somehow made it into BA phone queue, talked to an actual and will receive vouchers. Feels like a Christmas miracle."
"Newby, I am sure you have read the advice on smarttraveller. It advises against non essential overseas travel. We were due to leave on April 2nd for ten weeks driving around France. We were very disappointed , but have cancelled. Are you prepared to pay hospital costs if you do get it and need to be hospitalised.? Where will you eat if restaurants close?We love visiting France, but at the moment, it is not the France we love and I do not think it will improve in three weeks."
5onatripWe applied for our voucher as well to also receive within 48 hours. We were leaving on the 12th.
@5onatrip I'm glad everything worked out for you. That's not a bad deal. I think I'll wait a bit longer to see if my flight gets cancelled. An outright refund would be best case scenario.
"Although its doubtful our trip will go ahead, we,re still wait and see as Eurostar are still selling tickets for 22nd April, no idea if or when they,ll cancel trains, our hotel isnt letting us cancel yet either :("
We are planning to arrive via Zurich on 9 May. We will go unless borders are closed or the airline cancels the flight.

Have vacation booked for May 4-May 9. It looks like France will be heading to lockdown similar to Italy in which case we will be cancelling. There is also the problem of a mandatory 14 day quarantine upon arriving home (if you do make It safely home and don't contract the virus). So a week vacation turns into 3 weeks.
Question on airline vouchers: Are these good for same class/same origin-destination straight up? Or are they cash value (in which case you have to watch fares vigilantly)? Specifically Air France and partners.
Air France came around. Vouchers offered provided you travel within one year.
"Air France vouchers have been good for one year from the get go. They were one of the first airlines to get on board. They are now offering flat out refundsEdited: 7:25 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Well, we’ve made a decision that we won’t be going anywhere. I cancelled both Paris and London hotels today, thankfully they were fully refundable. I was also able to cancel and get a full refund from Turkish Airlines, even though it was non-refundable economy promo fare. Still waiting to see if Iberia and Eurostar will start offering refunds/vouchers which at the moment they are not, at least not for May travel. If they don’t.. oh well, I’ll take a loss, don’t really have a choice. We were traveling from 2 different locations and meeting in Paris, thus 2 different airlines. I’m so sad that we had to cancel this trip and about what is going on around the world due to this virus. I was very much looking forward to it, but there is just too much uncertainty right now and we don’t want to take any chances."
"Can anyone tell me how to cancel a flight on the Air France website? I was able to log into my account, locate tickets and found ways to change itinerary. Could not locate where to cancel. I even found the form to apply for a refund (which states you need to cancel flight first). Phone numbers are of course ringing in busy right now."
Missmarleygirl - Air France only refunds tax paid for non-refundable tickets. I’d send a screenshot taken this morning from their website if I could do one on this forum. I’m trying to get through their sales phone number to speak to a real person.
"Interesting read. For those of you that are planning to continue with your travel plans, you might want to have a plan B once you are there. We have a friend that left last Monday (10th) to Israel with her church group. They were scheduled to return home on the 21st of March, We received a text from her last night that they are being MADE to come back home. I shutter to think of what she and her travel companions will go through in the next couple of weeks. So the moral of the story, is that you might get there, but can you STAY there. We wanted to go back to Paris this next July, but I didn't book (before this started) because airfare seemed too high in my mind. We settled on a trip to New England. Set to leave July 8th. Still a few months out, but who knows what will happen between now and then.In the meantime, I keep a watchful eye on things and spend my time reading the best forum ever!Stay safe folks.L"
lovefrance2My husband was told that the evouchers are good for the amount of the original ticket and need to be used within one year. Used within one year not fly within one year. Hope that wasn't misinformation... this was last week. Vouchers have not arrived yet. Please let us know what you find out if you get through.
Missmarleygirl- Did your husband cancel on the Air France website or by phone? Were your tickets non-refundable? Currently. On the AF website it says you will only be refunded the sales tax on a non-refundable ticket. I would be very surprised if they don’t offer a full refund and/or a must book within one year voucher but want to speak with a real person before cancelling. We have cancel insurance but plan to rebook our trip for next year so would rather have a voucher. I’ll let you know once I get through. BTW our Airbnb reservation was already fully refunded.
"Missmarleygirl- Good News!Just spoke with AF. Our non-refundable tickets can be converted to a cash voucher (same value as purchase price) - our cancelation will be sent to the ‘back office’ and vouchers will be mailed within about 5 days. Vouchers must be used within one year (not dates traveled, just booked) And may be used on AF, KLM or Delta. She said website info had not been updated as things are changing rapidly.Feeling so much better!"
This is what we were told last week. So glad we didn't misunderstand! Now to wait for them to come! Thanks for the update!
"A note about AirBnB:While I don't believe they've added France to their special circumstances page, they are urging people to look at their ""trips"" page for any prior bookings and see what applies to them.For my April booking they wrote: ""Thinking about canceling because of the coronavirus? Cancel your reservation, choose the COVID-19 (coronavirus) reason, and we'll ask your host to approve a full refund. If they decline and you decide to cancel, we'll still give you the service fee as a coupon for your next trip.""I just wrote a message to my host saying it's obvious we need to cancel at this point -- but how about just changing our dates to April 2021 (and applying our payment)? I hope she sees that as fair but I will understand if she cannot accommodate; in my view we agreed to the terms of the rental (50% if canceled 7+ days prior to stay) and I can't expect her to take the full hit. (I might feel a little different if she was an agency or ""manager"" but she's not.)"
"LoveFrance2: So I'm clear on Air France: My current flight dates are April 19 and 27. ""Non-refundable."" Boston-Paris.If I cancel today (March 15) the ""one year"" voucher thing just means I have until March 15, 2021 to *book* , correct? I want to be sure I can change my flight to similar dates (mid April) in 2021. (I would re-book almost immediately on ""cancelling."")Also: Air France does make it a little hard to get their information because the link is not pinned to every page on their site as far as I can tell, just the home page. Seems like it might help to have it on the reservation page as well).Edited: 1:09 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Hamlet478,You cannot get the voucher on line. You have to call. We were told we can use voucher within one year of issue. We clarified with the agent. One year to use from date of issue or one year to fly? One year to use. We also clarified that it can be used on a code share flight. We were also told that any difference in the amount of the new fare would be our responsibility. Hope this helps.Edited: 1:34 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Hmm, this web page seems to allow you to choose voucher (once you have canceled the flight). It's the first option at the bottom under ""Reason for request."" https:/…"
We cancelled before the kaka hit the fan... You may be able to do it on line now.
"Yes. As, I understand you must rebook your tickets with the voucher within one year from the date you cancel. Not complete travel within one year. Call these two numbers to talk to a real person:1-800-237-27471-800-618-0104Both numbers were ringing busy but I kept trying and finally got through. We were set to fly to Paris April 8 and will be booking for April 2021. Just need to line up our Airbnb first.FWIW- I could not do this through the Flying Blue membership website or on the Air France website. I’m thinking it’s because if I just cancelled ‘showing no intention to rebook’ I would not have had the option of the vouchers. The Air France representative I spoke with first was with Flying Blue. She gave me these two phone numbers and instructed me not to select the option of entering my Flying Blue account number when I hear this option on the prompts. Good luck and please post back when you get results."
The Accor Hotels group sent an e-mail today saying that anybody with prepaid non-refundable bookings in any hotel of the group could get their bookings revalidated for a later date.
"Hamlet478 - It’s confusing for sure. I could not cancel my reservation on their website, only manage my itinerary in manner of date, time changes. In this case they would be waiving the $300 per ticket change fee. As I mentioned, I was able to locate the form to request a full refund but it said before you complete form make sure your trip is cancelled’ It’s fortunate that I was unable to cancel as I’d be out $2500."
"Hamlet478 - I apologize! If I had paged down through entire refund request form I would have seen a request for refund due to coronavirus. That said, I just was not able to cancel on their website. I’m sure it’s just me but now now it’s resolved.Sigh. I’m exhausted."
"That's frustrating how Air France's procedure is so confusing. Last week I was able to cancel thru their website and the system showed how much credits (refunds) will go to my credit card (original form of payment). Except the credits represented the airport taxes only. In calling Air France about the supposed promised vouchers the agent said I should've just called them and it would've been done in full. Told me to file a refund (via the refund form on their website) for the ticket cost part in order to get vouchers for that amount I doubt they will get to my claim soon.In short, just call them! Don't do anything by yourself on their system to avoid confusion.Edited: 3:22 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I havent had an email from Accor yet, but maybe its because I dont leave for 5 weeks and they might be waiting to see what happens"
2. Playing the wait and see gameAbsolutely this
"Traveling April 29 London - Paris-Switzerland-Amsterdam then back to Brisbane, Australia. Currrently playing the waiting game as Singapore won't let us pass through on our way home because we would have travelled through France within 14 days. This is so messed up. Travel Insuranz won't do anything until the Australian government upgrades our travel warning to Level 4 - "" Do not travel"". So presently stuck...low-key forced to travel as we will lose a lot of money. I'm sure there are plenty in the same situation....waiting.."
"Check Macrons speech (16.March20) France is ""at war"" (against corona virus), starting Tuesday 17.March20 lockdown for 15 days! Borders closed (except for cross border commuters) People weren't serious enough about respecting the rules which were established recently .... so now it's very! serious and lockdown will be controlled like in Spain, Italy...."
I have a flight booked to travel home on Wednesday 18th March from Paris Orly. Does the new lockdown affect this flight? Does my flight home classify as essential travel? Will public transport to Orly airport still be operating? Thank you.
"I have been lurking for weeks, and have recently rescheduled our trip to October - hoping it is long enough away. I just wanted to send a special thank you to all the local posters who tirelessly help us ""dumb tourists"" all the time, and especially now. Your insights and ""boots to the ground"" information has been invaluable. Also know that your contributions, sometimes kind, sometimes snarky, always informative are very much appreciated.Please stay safe and healthy!"
"Public transport is operating and flights are leaving, so you should be able to go, but it may vary depending on where you are going."
Thank you. I'm a bit more reassured now than I was yesterday.

"Don't stop hounding them, write there corporate headquarters. Ask for credit if no refund for 1 year"
"@Ako, hotel Gabriel Paris is offering free rebooking till December 31. If you explain your situation most likely they will refund your money, if it fails through reservations, contact guest relations."
"It’s obviously changed since you first posted but I’m in a wait and see mode for my mid-May Paris trip. My air bnb is allowing me to cancel right up until the trip and my airline is offering a voucher until November 30th but it’s SAS airlines and their prices have skyrocketed so we’d lose our money as we can’t afford $1,200 a ticket!Hopefully, things will improve by then! I have low hopes but drastic steps have been taken globally so I’m hoping that improves things! I work in a hospital and we will need a vacation when this is all over, plus time with family and friends!"
"It's ""a whole new world"" since I first posted on this thread. What I am not clear about, and I'm not sure even the experts know is the length of time our governments and medical experts will be recommending for the social distancing. Is this just for a short period of time to slow down the spread (flatten the rate of infection) and have testing and hospital beds more available or is this to be ongoing (I fear the latter)? (My trip is June 10th (Paris and Belfast), and my guess is that that is not going to happen (guessing there will be a recommendation not to travel for discretionary reasons like vacations still going then - level 3 reconsider travel) even if borders, restaurants/cafes and attractions open up (and they very well may not be back open at that time??).My non refundable expensive flights are on American Airlines, and I have heard that they are reducing flights due to lower demand (about 70% of flights will be canceled). I am hoping that our flight will be one they cancel, so I can get my money back and travel another year. My hotels are refundable with 48 hour notice. I have prepaid tickets for the Louvre and one food tour and travel on Easyjet between Paris and Belfast that is non refundable too. I won't be acting on anything until closer to that date (seeing what will happen with American Airlines) and what's going on in the world at that time, can we travel, and do we want to travel or not. If our flights are canceled, it's a wait till another year for sure. In the meantime, life as we knew if before, has at least temporarily changed. Prayers for all."
"Now is really big problems. Some my trips also cancelled because of it..I'm monitoring current travel restrictions at site https://restrictions.info/ , and it seems that situation now is really complicated.. :((Edited: 9:23 am, March 30, 2020 "

I am far from sure that airlines and hotels will fill up immediately once restrictions are lifted. People will be skittish.

Kathy884 - I apologize as I should not have recommended that you cancel your June trip. You should do what is right for you. Wishing you health and nothing but great trips in the future!
"I was reading information from the Paris visitors bureau which says that at the moment, airline reservations to Paris have dropped 70% for April, 39% for May and 36% for June. Frankly, I thought that would have already dropped more, and I'm sure that they will -- lots of people are certainly waiting for the airlines to announce full refunds for any type of ticket that you have purchased. Most reservations for June and August have not been cancelled."
"Cancelled flights, lodging, and a canal barge trip in Burgundy for mid May. I paid in advance for 4 nights at a highly rated TripAdvisor family run hotel in Paris (8 months ago). For that, the policy is non refundable and I received a 30 Euro discount per night for my wife and me. Within the last few weeks I wrote the owner and he said that the ''Virus'' may completely disappear by May. I did not argue, the reservation was made months ago, but our area is mandated to shelter for the next 30 days (as was announced again yesterday. The gentleman said contact again in April. So, that's what I'm going to do. Sometimes just going with the flow is best. Not upset, just biding my time. Health is more important than the money and hopefully the owner will live up to his great reviews. All other hotels, Delta Airlines, and the barge Apres Tout were great. Be safe in your travels."
<< Most reservations for June and August have not been cancelled. >>Of course I meant JULY and August.
"""Kathy884 - I apologize as I should not have recommended that you cancel your June trip. You should do what is right for you. Wishing you health and nothing but great trips in the future!""I didn't take your post like that at all. We are planning not to go, but hoping American Airlines cancels the flight, so we might be able to get a refund for the expensive airfares. Wishing the best to everyone."
"1NCfoodie- hoping your Paris hotel comes around. Sadly, don’t think this virus will disappear in May but maybe the hotel owner is just being very optimistic. You’d think with this being a worldwide event the hotel owner would be more flexible. After 911 we had to cancel a VRBO rental in the Var and the homeowner allowed us to rebook without an extra fee and when we had to cancel altogether she graciously refunded our deposit."
"I wish I could say I was encouraged by the sense of optimism in this thread - apparently Covid-19 will be cured and the world re-set to ""normal"" on any date from Easter to the end of May. Maybe June. Maybe July. Maybe August. As if, after the tens of thousands of deaths in Europe, they will be in a condition to indulge the travel wishes of non-Europeans hoping for reduced crowds in the streets and museums. As if there is a guarantee that a nation or a city devastated by this disease - let's use New York as an example - will just switch off the impact and switch on the new world. Maybe the intrepid will be happy to venture into NY by July. Maybe the locals will be happy to risk re-infection by a surge of new potential carriers.All this before Covid-19 sweeps across the US (this show is just at curtain up in the US) and the rest of us. Why will any country, early in the cycle and maybe recovering, want to receive visits from the nationals of those following later in the cycle.Sad to say, the concerns over lost bookings for a few grand will pale into insignificance compared to the wide scale misery that will trail into 2021 before a vaccine becomes widely available.""No fair""! Yep. That's how the cookie crumbles. Some people - well tens of thousands - are dead."
"@ lovefrance2, good observation and since the bill was paid 7 months ago, it is what it is. In a few instances where I paid deposits, people have been decent and actually going overboard. Additionally, some small operators I have let keep the $. I think we're all in this together and travel is civility and love of our fellow world citizens. Be well, safe travels, this too shall pass. 1NCF"
"1NCfoodie - Yours is a lovely post. This is a very nice and heartwarming approach if you have the economic means to not demand a refund from small tour operators. Being a small tour operator myself (I'm a single person business) I thank you for your generous sense of good will. My only interaction with my customers over the past few weeks has been granting refunds and I've just granted the last refund of my only remaining customer for the upcoming season. Thus, as of now I have absolutely zero tours booked for the 2020 season. However, I don't want to evoke sympathy for myself because my wife and I have the economic means/savings to last this out (our apartment is paid off and we have no monthly mortgage or rental payments) so I don't have it as bad as some other people and therefore I'm not going to complain. I had absolutely zero problems with refunding the deposits for any of my customers because as a small tour operator my business model is built on personal and customized service and to not understand the current global pandemic and how that has affected people's travel plans is just bad business for the future (because the only way to look at this is from a future standpoint). But, if you have the economic means to not demand a refund from a small tour operator then I just had to say that your heart is bigger than your wallet and good karma will find its way back to you one of these days. :)"
"SB, I hope you can still manage a bike ride to go shopping. My bike ride to the shopping centre is mostly countryside and farm fields. Vitamin D every day, call it a win win. I am on the mezzanine deck if you are thirsty. Cheers!"
"Just here to say to all the Parisian forum members that we are thinking of you and will be back just as soon as we can be!Personally, we would never ask for a refund from a small tour operator (and are trying to give our budgeted monthly amounts to our local small businesses,In our household, we are both fortunate enough to be able to work from home (until August! And for me, it may be longer as I am now old enough that my workplace may permit me to stay home longer). Fortunately we're both introverts and have a ton of projects to do and ways to continue teaching.Everyone please stay safe. Public transport is a true risk, judging from New York."
"I don't see another relevant thread here, and forgot to post this (maybe it's already been posted). This is a fairly reliable data dashboard that helps visualize what's going on with CoVid in Europe:https://ncov2019.live/data"
"Thank you as well LeBiscuit D but just so you know, there is nothing wrong under the present circumstances with asking for a refund from any tour operator (and realistically also with airlines/hotels etc.). Despite the circumstances of the aforementioned enterprises it is also important to remember that many tourists may also be prohibited from working and are lacking in income right now, or maybe they're not the richest people in the world and have worked hard and saved diligently for a very special trip. Charity and generosity aside, from a strict business perspective it makes the most sense to give a refund now no matter what because failing to do so will lead to loads of negative reviews for any such business and will hurt them even more in the long term. I'm equal parts cynic and optimist and the optimist in me believes that good people will not let a good deed go unrewarded. We're all in this together as global citizens and since we the global people have been completely and utterly failed by the greed of all governments/politicians/corporations who have put quarterly profit margins ahead of the well being of the average citizen then it is best to put our faith in each other and work together to pull each other through and then later after this has subsided put pressure on those responsible to make sure these pandemics don't become the norm in the future."
"In Italy, the hardest hit of all European countries, things may be improving just a little ... as, I believe, the overall number of ""new"" cases discovered, each day, now, is slightly lower than past days. Some European countries, my own, Great Britain, has, it is believed not yet reached its peak.For my own part, having cancelled a May trip ... I now have vacations booked to Paris and Barcelona for September & October respectively, which I think may well be possible.Keep well allAnthony K"
"@French_Mystique Your post is spot on and should strike a chord among those of us who love interacting with world citizens like you. I'm a little more cynical than you and know how memories especially by politicians are so short term. We should all not forget and make our voices known. Even as we in the USA watched the world, our non-leaders failed to act. Our stimulus package of course carried more tax deductions for the upper 1% of wealth. Politicians throw bones to the general public and tend to throw $$$$ to their well healed crew. On a brighter note, we saw the sun rise, the spring bluebirds have laid eggs in their box in my yard, and I'm planning more travel for later this year and next for my wife and me. My wife is sewing surgical masks for others and we're sheltering in place. Be well, be safe, and be smart. The world needs us travel buddies to stick together and show politicians that most people are good. Maybe they should examine their own mindsets and fragile egos.

@231 FM...thanks for the excellent post...I have seen so many posts almost shaming people (on many various threads) for expecting and asking for a full refund. As mentioned many will simply not be able to travel for quite some time...so much has changed. Also as you mention the word of mouth positive comments about these tour operators or hotels etc. will hopefully really help when people can start booking. I have a trip planned for France in July and will finally be faced with the cancellation process ...have really been putting it off but have to face the facts.
"Just got notice from Delta that my flight for May has been canceled. They of course offered me a two-year credit but I wrote back to them and told them I was unable to rebook during that window and requested a full refund. Other than waiting, any advice on how I should proceed to maximize my chances of getting that refund? Merci."
"MargieK, I think it’s a DOT regulation that if the airline cancels the flight and of course can’t provide other flights because your destination is in lockdown, they must refund your money if you request it. Suggest you look into that."
"MargieI just had the same email from Delta for my May flights. But my credit was just good for 6 months! I called reservations, told the woman my trip was cancelled and I would like a refund and she handled it with no problems. I was on hold for three minutes. Give them a call and ask for a refund, they are required by law to honor it in this circumstance."
"American is being more generous that they were at first, and other airlines may do the same. They are allowing rebooking or a voucher good thru Dec. 2021 for flights scheduled thru Sept. 30, 2020 that were booked before all the COVID 19 stuff. I'll wait to see if my June 10th flight is canceled, so I can hopefully get a full refund, but will take this offer if I have no cancellation 72 hours before we are scheduled to fly. Just started canceling other things that are refundable today."
"For our trip to Paris, Bordeaux, and Dordogne, last week in May through first week of June, at this time, we are also in the wait-and-see game."
"For our trip to Paris, Bordeaux, and Dordogne, last week in May through first week of June, at this time, we are also in the wait-and-see mode."
I’ve not cancelled my mid-May trip to Paris but obviously it is not happening. I’m waiting for the airline to cancel and I need to cancel my air bnb. I’m not going but it just breaks my heart to cancel such an anticipated trip. I’m hoping I can get my money back and I can reschedule next year.
I spent 30+ minutes on hold with Delta's refund line and then gave up. I'll try again Monday; they apparently don't answer this line on weekends. There seems to be a way to request a refund on line but I am reluctant because there could be some fine print that I'm missing and I want to speak to a human. I hope my experience is as good as yours was!
I have purchased a plane ticket for the end of August and reserved a refundable room. Hoping for the best!
@243 do realize that per an ordinance issued by French authorities your hotel does NOT have to refund you for the hotel room...they can extend vouchers for future stay for 18 months after which you might get a refund. Right now refundable is not necessarily refundable...they might refund but don't have to. I just cancelled a booking for July and was informed of this. A first time for everything!!
I just canceled my hotel for the first half of June. I had paid a 1 night deposit for a refundable room with 2 days from arrival notice. I got an email confirming that my deposit amount would be credited to my cc.
@245..consider yourself lucky...they apparently do not have to refund and my hotel in Provence will not. Two private guides with deposits have kindly said they will be refunding and I expect that to happen. This is rough for all of us and I think if requested they should refund...makes one want to book there in the future.
"I'm glad your guides refunded you, gene, as they should have. I just don't get anyone not granting a refund at this point in time. Once it becomes possible to travel again I hope that those guides/hotels/airlines that willingly granted refunds will be the ones that receive the most business and that shame will be placed on any such company that did not grant a refund. As the saying goes, this will come back to bite them in the ass."
"And to use another saying, FM, what goes around comes around. So I expect you to have much business when the situation returns to ""normal."""
@247...yes FM that is exactly my thinking...to be honest the hotel deposit is not that much (fortunately) and if next year I am able to take this trip as planned I will book the same guides but will pick a different property to stay at. I would fully understand if it was non refundable but that is not the case. As I read TA often I can see that most hotels are not invoking this ordinance.
"Re: # 247, 248, and 249, I agree with your posts and hope those with honorable business practices come back stronger after this situation eases. I have instructed those hotels and guides that I had booked to keep a small percentage of the fee as a gratuity to help them and their families. This is not a pat myself on the back post. Just an idea for those than can afford to make such a gesture. Many of us consider travel as an essential part of our lives. At this time many are struggling and a small monetary gesture goes a long way. I want these people to be there when we can all enjoy the world up close and personal. Just my thoughts as we continue to fight this stealthy villain. Be well, be safe, be smart. Look toward the future and plan travel and be kind to our fellow travelers and those that admirably accommodate us. 1NCF"
@250 ...thanks for your thoughts and your idea is a good one. I sure would not be opposed to that...never really thought of it..in fact one guide did mention a very small charge for the mechanics of issuing the refund...no problem at all. My question is did you pose that option after they agreed to refund (given they could have refused) or did you start out with that? Right now they can resell the room I booked as it is on the website....it is for lavender season at a very popular place and no doubt will have domestic travelers staying this summer...therefore it seem just right to refund.
"All three! First, I cancelled my flight to Finland/Baltic countries. Sadly, I was suppose to be in Tallinn, Estonia right now. Second, I have another trip planned to France/Czechia/Hungary in August, so I’ll wait and see if it’s possible. Third, if Europe or abroad aren’t options, then I’ll try to visit places I’ve never been to within the US. Maybe, Yosemite or Las Vegas??"
"@gene, I was in communication and I proposed it when they offered a credit to my account. One personally guided tour offered me the option of a refund or a credit and 10% bonus when I re-booked. I chose the credit. Cash flow for some of these folks is at a premium. Anyone who chooses to receive a full refund, I have no problem with. If I encountered someone stuck on principles because 9 months ago you agreed to a non refund, I would have a problem with only from an exceptional circumstance that the world had never faced. Social media and the like, including Tripadvisor is karma waiting to happen. IMHO. Good luck and safe travels."
"I can readily imagine certain hotels and guides not being able to cheerfully refund prepaid bookings, but I cannot imagine those who would not spontaneously offer a credit for the amount paid for a future booking."
"I changed London and Paris from May to August in Feb. Had to pay 300 change fee on Brit Air as people were still traveling. Then applied for a voucher on BA which allows me to defer flight to one year after departing flight for no change fee. So will shoot for August of 2021. As seniors, one with COPD, we cannot fly until there is a vaccine -period. Could try to get original 300 dollar change fee back from Brit Air but phone wait times are crazy.Edited: 11:16 am, April 21, 2020 "

"Same here, RevBT. We're booked for the end of June and I'm waiting to see if AirFrance cancels our flights. My gut feeling is that we're not going, but I'm holding out a little longer."
"We re-booked for December (cancellable) but at this point in time I'm not even sure that will happen. Hopefully it'll be much better, but just the thought of potentially having to quarantine away from home makes you think twice."
"I had an April/May trip which was cancelled and I received a refund from American quickly.I still have an October trip which I expect will also be cancelled. If it isn't I'll do it myself and take a voucher, etc. I don't plan on traveling any earlier than late Fall 2021 but I'm thinking that 2022 might be a more realistic target and, who knows, even that might not be possible.Edited: 10:19 am, April 24, 2020 "

"Some people are, here, looking to August, hopefully ... others not sure about October and one wishing for Christmas.My greatest fear is that if we, as a large public body, in our countries, push hard for the relaxation of lockdowns, then we invite a second wave of the virus which could be as virulent, or more virulent, than the first.We must hope that all Governments will be acting on the cautious side, heeding the advice of Scientific and Health Professionals and not luring us into death traps, just to aid their economies.

I had booked for Colmar and Paris in December and I cancelled. I am hoping to go in May/June 2021.
Cancelled four international trips (one to Paris/France) from March through August. I expect those scheduled after that this year will also be postponed. The virus will likely still be around and I don't want to be obviously infected while traveling outside my country (or indeed within my country) nor a symptom-free carrier. Fingers crossed that an effective vaccine is found sooner rather than later.
Update: I finally got through to Delta and they are refunding my fare for my May trip. Took a half hour on hold but absolutely no pushback or problem once I connected. There is a separate phone number for refunds: 1-800-847-0578.
"i think there is a process for any of us that had trips planned for this summer...the first phase is the feeling I had early on in this...oh we are going in July no problem! Then as things moved along and the virus moved into the USA phase two began in the process. We became the worst place in the world for Covid 19 and it was still killing hundreds daily in France etc. I began to realize that travel this summer may well not happen and then you finally bring yourself to cancel and actually find that no one you are communicating with in France even expected you to come given the uncertainty of summer and fall. The process took some time...posters like @262 are in phase 1. going to be slow process getting the world back up and running and tourism is not the most important thing and will be risky for some time to come.Edited: 1:57 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"As this is uncharted territory, I think that hope springs eternal for many with travel plans this year. But I believe that #270 has painted an accurate picture."
"FYI, the European Athletics Championships due to be held in Paris at the end of August have been cancelled."
"I had a trip planned to Paris and Provence in October, and I will not be going. I had not booked airfare yet as I was still in the watching for the best price mode. I had booked all of my accommodations, however. The ones I booked on VRBO I was able to cancel without any problem, but still have not seen any money refunded to my credit card. The Paris and Antibes apartments were on Air BnB and the deposits were non-refundable. I messaged them both to see if there was any leeway for a refund or a future credit and they both refused. I am waiting to see until closer to the time when I would have had to pay the rest of the money on both of them, and I will cancel before that. If the borders are still closed to international travel, then I think I would have more of a case for a refund. I am in another dispute with Air BnB over a deposit on a place within my own country in May. I doubt I will be getting that $500 back either.I will be very reluctant to use Air BnB in the future as their customer service sucks. I will also never book any place again with a non-refundable deposit because even if the situation is totally out of your control, they do not have to refund you anything. Interestingly, I see they now have a filter that you can use for flexible cancellation policy.When I do eventually make the trip to Paris and Provence, there is no way I will be booking those two particular apartments."
"Just an update, as I can't edit my previous post. After making me jump through many hoops, Air BnB has finally agreed to refund me my non-refundable deposit on my domestic reservation for May. What finally did it was our Alberta government's re-opening plan clearly states that travel is not recommended."
from most reports for those with Air BNB reservations within the next months they have agreed to refund....I think you are too early for Oct. and while trips in Oct. are doubtful we simply do not know what will happen and they are hoping to be back in business for international visitors. Just have to watch that one.
"Are they issuing you a refund or credit, I have a flight to Paris and Rome scheduled fire June"
I have an Airbnb booked for mid July in Provence. The host won’t let me cancel and Airbnb are ignoring my request to them to refund the £5000 already paid. As France will have a 2 week quarantine in place at that time we obviously can’t travel. I’m disappointed how difficult both the host and Airbnb are being considering the global situation.
"We had a trip planned for June and we simply asked our VRBO host if we could push the reservation to 2021 and he agreed, no problem. The deposit we had made was technically nonrefundable and we didn’t want to make a thing out of it, assuming the owner depends on vacation rental for part of his income. He said the deposit we made would apply to next year. The VRBO is in Alsace."
"Re Post 276...You should, now, be looking at cancellations, refunds or vouchers. You will not be crossing those borders in June.Note, generally, re-booking to a later date is far easier than getting refunds.Keep wellAnthony KEdited: 10:33 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"June in Paris is not happening for us for sure. Canceled everything, but air (airline I've heard usually notifies of cancelations about 7 days in advance, so we will wait and see and try to get a refund then). As much as I'd love to go and reshedule, I have no idea if/when it will be prudent for us to do international travel. It seems like the whole world has changed overnight.Let's see, I booked a two night trip to Ste Genevieve, MO (an hour and 15 minute drive from our house) midweek (for more social distancing) Sept. 30 to Oct. 2. It's a colonial French historic little town (historic homes, museums, cute little restaurants) with a nice state park and another nature area nearby. It's definitely not Paris, but something we actually might be able to do in 2020 lol. And if we cancel it will take less than 10 minutes to do that.Hang in there everyone."
We were supposed to arrive in Paris today. Sigh......
Article from the Guardian regarding tourists entering France:https:/…
"Hi Folksapologies if this has already been asked (I did look but didn't see anything). I was due to visit Paris 13th - 18th May but due to Covid19 my flight was cancelled.I am trying to contact my hotel (Picardy Hôtel-Gare du Nord). I've tried contacting them via phone, email, via booking.com and their 'contact us' web-form but so far no luck.I've read that hotels are still open - https:/…info-disruption-paris - but I'm wondering if that is not true of all hotels. Is there a way of finding out if a hotel is currently open or not? I would be happy to get a voucher for my booking but I'm concerned that I need to show I made an appropriate effort to contact the hotel.Kind regards."
re the link in Post #282 : so that makes it all clear then?!?
"Shane, the vast majority of hotels are closed at the moment."
Thanks for that reply kerouac2. Suppose that is good news. Better chance of getting a refund or voucher if the hotel is closed as oppose to me being a no-show.
They have to give you a voucher or refund you the full amount after 18 months if you don't use it.
@Shane S Currently I can rebook my cancelled res at the St Severin beginning June 2. However contacting the hotel they said “Indeed the hotel is closed due to the covid situation. We don’t know when the government will allow us to open again so the safest would be to reschedule your trip in July if it’s possible for you.”
Thanks AriLaI'll keep trying to contact my hotel. At this point I just want to be able to prove I made a concerted effort to contact them.
"Although, I was not officially notified of cancellations or changes by American Airlines yet, I read about someone else somewhere here on Trip Advisor forums looking up their flights in June on the AA website who saw significant changes, talked to an American Airlines rep, and got a refund. We had premium economy flights to Paris June 10th, open jaw, flying home from Dublin June 20th that combining all our tickets together were over $5000, a significant part of our trip budget for sure. I checked late last night and saw the same situation for our tickets. I was able to talk to a customer service rep with just a 1 and a 1/2 minute hold time at 1:30 a.m. CST. The rep was super helpful, told me I could get a refund based on the significant schedule changes when I inquired about that, and gave me great easy to follow instructions about the website location to go to and how to request those. I have the refund requests in now, and per the website expect the refunds to come thru in about seven business days. Kudos to American Airlines for their helpfulness/professionalism and the fact that a refund seems eminent (much nicer for us than a voucher). Hope these airlines survive. The refund means we will most likely be able to do this trip at a future date of our own choosing when authorities are no longer advising against international travel, we feel safe traveling, and things we would like to do are open (new normal which may be a long time in coming). Now all I need to still do for our vacated vacation is actively request a refund for our Easyjet flights from Paris to Belfast. From reading forum posts (the airline one here on TripAdvisor) and looking at the Easyjet website, I see that they are canceling flights on a seven day rolling basis to keep customer service calls and refunds manageable. I made a tickler for myself to check back around June 3rd about those.Edited: 12:36 am, May 08, 2020 "
"KathyI love to read good news. I am delighted that you have encountered no real problems, although sadly you have lost a wonderful trip.I sincerely hope you will be able to find a date, in the not too distant future, when you can take that trip.Keep wellAnthony K"
"I am trying to make decision on October trip. Any ideas.? I want to go when life will be more normal, restaurants fully open etc. should I reschedule?"
"Kathy, things in Paris are slowly reopening now. Restaurants in Paris begin indoor service late in June, if I recall correctly. Borders with the EU are reopening now. Borders for other international travelers start opening in July. Museums and monuments are reopening now (i.e. Versailles and Atelier des Lumieres and others open now, Eiffel Tower later in June, Louvre beginning of July). I think your chances are excellent of Paris being ""more normal"" by October, unless there is a resurgence of the virus and restrictions come back...but none of us have a crystal ball and can't tell if that will happen."
"Right now I'm taking a 'wait and see' perspective for the rest of 2020, until there's convincing evidence that the Paris I love will be open for business somewhat close to whatever 'normal' is post-COVID-19. We've already had a family trip that had to be cancelled in April; thankfully, we had no difficulty with refunds/credits for flights and hotel. My wife and I visit our beloved city once or twice each year and look forward to returning to see our friends, our favorite hotel and restaurants, and falling in love (again) with Paris."
"‘Kathy, things in Paris are slowly reopening now. Restaurants in Paris begin indoor service late in June, if I recall correctly. Borders with the EU are reopening now. Borders for other international travelers start opening in July. ‘ I’m baffled how Americans think that they’ll be allowed/should be travelling to countries that have far more control of the virus than the USA does at the present time? In Australia we have passed our first peak and there’s talk we might possibly be able to go as far as New Zealand soon, but the word is we won’t be going further until next year at the earliest. If you’re in a country where the virus is running wild, id be expecting to be staying home until there’s a pretty good chance you’re not going to be carrying it back into a country that’s done the hard work getting the numbers down. And from the news, that’s going to be quite a while."
"Re #295 -- LOL No need to be baffled. I'm under no such assumptions, as I indicated in a post the day before the one above: (#171 in this thread)https:/…106860581"
"@Kathy, Today was supposed to be our flight back to the US after a special 45th anniversary trip that had been scheduled to begin in late May. Additionally, we are supposed to be in Germany during the Christmas Market Season in December. Based on the soaring rates of CoVid-19 in many states, I personally doubt we'll be allowed into EU until after the first of the year at best. I have re-booked France for October 2021 and am cancelling my hotel reservations in Germany for December. I will wait on canceling my flights due to perks and Delta One when warnings are still in effect and change fees are waved. No one has any idea what the fall of this year will bring. However, it will also be the beginning of seasonal flu months in the US, thus further complicating medical issues and detection. However, our Orange Idiot, and his inconsistencies are more than likely going to hamper our international travel. He has not endeared himself to the EU and its leaders = very skeptical of anything truthful coming out of his mouth(many EU TA friends communicate with me in private). With over 1000+ new cases of CoVid-19 per day in several states and Arizona declaring another health emergency, it seems the writing is on the wall IMHO. Our testing is lousy and grossly inaccurate (ex medical and speak to colleagues/friends in Canada, the UK, Germany, France, and Spain where I taught). Personally, I would reschedule if possible. Be well, be safe, be smart. Safe travels to all."
#295 amen to that!You are right on the button!
"we were supposed to be coming to Nantes & then Paris from next week. Outbound flight is cancelled, no news on inbound yet but both hotels have said we can use our (non-changeable, non-refundable) bookings for up to 18months. Very grateful and happy about that so we will be looking to come over next year - or maybe sneak a little pre-Christmas trip to Paris in this year!"
"The next news on which non European countries will be allowed into France will probably be released around June 30th, since July 1st will be an opening date for certain countries."
#295 and 298Apparently you don't know too much about the Country that you jump to criticize so quickly but It is quite large and the virus situation is quite different in various locations throughout the Country and even within some States. But it's good to know you know exactly what the situation will be like in the entire US 4 months from now...
I hope to be going to Paris in April of 2021. It is my hope that I will be able to travel in France and then Italy at that time. Although this is 10 months from now I will remain cautious.
"Completely agree with pinkfrangipani. We cancelled our travel plans From USA to France scheduled for April.And will revisit this trip in 2021. On a positive note, I received a full refund (no vouchers) from Air France yesterday. We’re rolling the dice for a trip to Mid-Coast Maine this October, the home owner is being very flexible and had a joke for us “pending travelers from California not being allowed in Maine” . The USA has completely blotched the attempt to contain this pandemic, what makes us think we will be welcome in Europe any time soon?"
"#301 you think the rest of the world isn’t watching in horror at what’s happening in the USA? Well aside from people in Brazil... trust, it’s very easy to see that your country does not have a handle on the spread. there might be an odd county that has, but you’re doing very poorly. And it’s all over the news.  We have just been told we probably won’t be able to travel until next year, except maybe to New Zealand. Most of our cases are in returning residents who are bringing it in from overseas. France just had months of lockdown, you think they’re going to welcome you bringing in the virus again?  stop being selfish, stay home for a while. Like everyone else I want to go back to France, I should have been there right now, I’ve lost a few thousand dollars because of it. But for the greater good, I accept we have to. And yeah I wasn’t aiming my comment at any one american in particular. It’s all equally baffling."

"There really are some Americans like myself who are critical of what's going on with the people in government & how COVID-19's being handled (amongst other things).We also canceled a trip to Paris that was scheduled for May. I think we'll be fortunate to even think of making plans for May 2021. Unless some radical changes occurs before then! In the meantime, I will have to settle for living vicariously and envying others."
@304...one American here that agrees with you 100%.
I agree with you. I cannot imagine Americans will be welcomed to the EU any time soon as the virus us still all over the place here. We are hopeful to be able to go next summer but who knows at this point. Texas seems to be wide open as far as we can see. And our beaches are as crowded as anything apparently. I’m afraid it’s going to take forever to get this virus under control here.
Just the fact that the United States is the #1 country in the world for covid cases (USA #1! USA #1! -- is it always a positive chant?) -- should put a damper on many plans until there is a change in the statisics;
"I know Kerouac. I’m so frustrated. We have been frustrated for the last 4 years and now this. On a positive note, my husband is working on obtaining his Italian citizenship for him and our adult kids. We are going to leave for a while when we finally can. Not sure how long but definitely a while."
@310 lucky you with an escape plan. None here. Just wait until the rallies start this next week. This country never really shut down and will be difficult to say where wave 1 ends and wave 2 begins. It seems New York is moving cautiously and hope it works well for them.
"#304. Again. I don't know if it is a reading comp issue or a not caring issue, but you are assuming all of the US is in a similar boat with regards to the current # of cases and the way the virus is handled. You talk about it being outrageous that a particular person considers traveling abroad, but you have no clue that the numbers are completely different in various places in the Country and assuming so is just ignorant. Perhaps the person you addressed was previously infected and has the anti-bodies, perhaps they are willing to isolate for a couple weeks before they travel, perhaps they are from an area with minimal exposure. There are places in the US that have the virus more under control than places in Europe so generalizing is dumb...but hey, that's TA. The gall of you to pretend a person is at fault without knowing anything about them or their situation is typical. When push comes to shove each Country or region makes it's decisions. If France or any other Country does not want US citizens to come they should not allow them to do so. But don't open the borders to them and then try to pretend it is them at fault for coming. That's just a dumb, misguided comment"
"Re: #303lovefrance2This was not a joke. From Maine.gov :Gov. Mills has issued a “Stay Safer at Home” Order for all Maine people. All out-of-state travelers coming into Maine, and Maine residents returning to Maine, must either receive a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to arrival or complete a 14-day quarantine, per the Keep Maine Healthy plan. The way things are going, I would not expect this to change in the near future.Edited: 11:31 am, June 20, 2020 "
"Saw an interview on CNN with the mayor of St. Petersburg, FL. The governor claimed that the average age of patients being admitted to FL hospitals was 37 so they didn't have severe cases, not likely to die.The mayor said he's not surprised, as the bars and restaurants in his city are full mainly of people in their 20s and 30s.But he's imposing a mask requirement in his city as are some other FL cities, because the governor won't do it statewide."
"We are aware of the Maine requirement and prepared to test just before we leave. Maine.gov has a form on their website. Masks on plane, two seats across, sanitizer etc. Small price to pay to keep us and others safe."
"Some people who don't die of Covid can have long-lasting issues. There are reports of people having symptoms lasting for weeks, (especially strong tiredness and difficulty to breathe), and those who have to go under artificial breathing face months of rehab when they come out of it. It's not a fun disease to get even if you don't die from it.Edited: 3:00 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"And the thing is, regardless of whether or not you are worried that YOU will get it, you can be asymptomatic and give it to others. As long as you are in transit, a test 72 hours prior to arrival means nothing. You can pick it up in an airport after the test is done. We have cancelled two trips abroad, not out of fear for our own health, but out of respect for others... I cannot imagine living with myself if I infected someone else...All because of my need for a change of scenery.  At this point, I cannot imagine that anyone in Europe would be happy to see an American... Anymore than a Mainer would be to see someone from an out of state hot spot. Travel right now is just plain selfish, IMHO. And this is from a travelholic! Sorry if this offends."
We had a trip planned in May 2020 for 3 days in Paris then an 8 day river cruise on the Rhone then 3 days in Amsterdam .. All has obviously been cancelled and we have now rebooked for next July (2021) .. The same itinerary but the river cruise is a little longer .. We are so hoping everything is settled by then and everyone is allowed to travel to each other's countries .. *fingers crossed*
"It’s not a comprehension problem James. Nor is it that the world doesn’t know what’s going on in the USA regards Covid. There’s no proof antibodies are going to help for any length of time. There’s not going to be planeloads or yanks from states that have a handle on it (even if there were such states, yes those of us outside the USA can google and see, if we’ve missed seeing it on the news) Regardless of what you seem to think, by world standards the USA is doing extremely poorly and yes, I fail to see why Americans think they will be welcomed anywhere for a long time. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re taking such offence since you’ve said elsewhere you’re not going anywhere... Au revoir"

"We live in Texas and are so disappointed in our leadership right now. Both at the state and national level. And the sad part is everyone still supporting all of this lack of leadership. Ugh!We had planned to retire this year and head to Paris for a year in August. We had researched visas and were going to have a friend who owns a relocation company help us find an apartment. Everything is on hold now and I am just happy that neither us nor any of our family have this so far. However, someone I know well and her daughter both have it so it is definitely spreading quickly here."
"@321 My state is pretty calm but still many cases with forecast for fall resurgence. If the ""leadership"" is allowed to continue for another four years you might be but one of many looking to ""relocate""...it never needed to be this bad."
We we are working on Italian citizenship so yeah we are wanting to definitely relocate for a while.
