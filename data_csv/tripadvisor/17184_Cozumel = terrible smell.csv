Has anyone ever noticed how bad the east side of the island smells and how much garbage there is? We drove there yesterday with the windows down and were overwhelmed with the stench of human waste. It totally smells like an outhouse over there. Do they empty their toilets right into the ocean or what?
"That smell might be that ""stinkweed"" that grows over there. I'm sure there is an actual name for the plant but I don't know what it is.And yes, there is a lot of garbage. There are organized groups who frequently spend time over there picking up trash. It's an uphill battle but I commend them for their efforts."
"I don't know if you'll be able to click on this link, but I believe this is the plant that produces that aroma.cozumelmycozumel.com/Photos/WildSideDriftwooâ€¦"
"Oh ok. Well thanks for the info, I am glad that plant doesn't grow where I live :)"
"The trash washes up from South America and parts south. Many of us take a trash bag with us and do a little clean up every time we are there....What is that old adage? ""Leave it cleaner than the way you found it."" There is a group on Facebook called Trashy Little Group that has more organized clean ups.As far as the smell, you might have also been smelling the mangroves (or as we used to call places like these, the ""swamp"" .) If the wind had changed directions. As Jana said, the plants on that side do have a distinctive smell. I have never thought it was objectionable to the point you mentioned."
maybe it was just the person on the other side of the car blaming it on the island
hahahahahahah@ stkdog too funny.....jimmy
"Yep, coffee right out the nose!"
"I've never found the smell on that side to be unpleasant. Distinctive, yes."
MNhassnow-EXACTLY! It's the sea and the mangroves and does not smell like human waste.
the smell is from the buffets at the all inclusives
"Gosh, I was totally unaware that there were AI buffets on the east side of the island! You learn something new every day...the dump, however, is over there. Could that be what you were smelling?"
I didn't notice a smell when we were on the east side this past summer. I also didn't notice any garbage. Sorry you didn't have a good time - the day we spent on the east side is one of my favorite memories of our trip.
"Hey man, 1 trash washes from all over, from the US, CAN, South A. Japan, Portugal, Spain you name it. How would we go and dump our trash in our beaches? Unfortunately we are being part of a global problem. 2 the smell of salt, dried weed, sea rosemary makes the different smell to OUTDOORS/BEACH. 3 sorry you did not like our beaches. Will appreciate you share with us when you find a beach that does not smells like beach. CheersAdrian"
"I have never smelled it either, but I am used to any of that water smell as I grew up in Melbourne Fla. and lived on the Indian River. Lots of mangroves and seaweed. I can remember when we would have guest come and visit and mention the smell to us, and we would comment, what smell. You get used to it, and it was only there during certain times. Not all the time. And no, it doesnt smell like human waste. Not the greatest subject post to have on our first page if a newcomer were to log on. Maybe we should just make it go away and let it get buried with better subjects...Art"
"We do notice the smell. Personally, I don't think it is pleasant, but whenever we smell it we just laugh and say.....well, we're back in Mexico."
"I do not know about the terrible smell on the otherside. This is the first post I have ever heard of that . I think it is sweet and distinctive of the ice plants there on the east side of Cozumel. Island trash is mainly the result of Oil Tanker crews, who just throw thier items overboard and eventually wash up on islands across the globe. I have found many artifacts from Haiti to Africa wash up on Cozumel Beaches. The Human waste comment is not redally known to be a true experience here on the East side.Edited: 9 years ago "
"I personally love the smell of the east side beaches! We just enjoyed the drive yesterday and had really been missing he salty air and what my husband and I like to call ""stinky ferret bushes"" because they remind is of the ferrets that we used to have as pets! :)"
I would welcome that smell over the snow and cold we have had this winter. I couldn't make it to Cozumel this year; I will have to wait until next year to inhale the smell of paradise!
Well we are impervious to strange smells cause we are from the Houston area.
"I actually like the smell of the plant that grows rampently on the east side!So, is it actually an ice plant? I think I remember it flowering last September when we there. I have grown ice plant at home as a house plant, with tiny deep pink flowers, but it had no odor. The east side is nothing but beautiful to us!"
Funny how the eastside smells remind us all of different things. Me - I love nothing more then laying on an empty beach over there breathing it all in. The smell of the eastside is like freedom to me - No high rises no conjested highways just air sand ocean.......oh my vacation is still too far away . : (
I don't actually recall the scent of the east side. Guess I'll have to go back for another whiff...
I try to stay on the eastside as much as possible. We plan to spend three days of our trip this year in that little eco hotel not sure of the name. The beaches are amazing and the little bars are just as wonderful.The titel of this post could be seen as offensive and actually I find it a bit rude. I can see why Adrian posted what he did.

"Smells like shizzle, shizer or shint? just the usual lack of amenity which will result in some form of epidemic and bring more misery and death,"
I think perhaps the op should have had a breath mint.
"Just reviewed this post - wow, some of you are so sensitive! If it's a plant, it's a plant, no big deal! I did like the beaches and I did have a good time. I just associated the piles of garbage with the smell. Sorry to offend so many of you."
"So sorry alex1012, that was me. I had two helpings of chile the night before."
"Global Trash ProblemWe are experiencing now our own mistake as a society on our bad management of waste in the WOLRD. Not only Cozumel beaches is victim of thise but many places in the world where trash washes at the coastlines with the currents.We have a group of people leading by Kathy Watts (littletrashy group) that does clean ups at the beaches perioricaly as well as the city has a team of 21 people doing so on an every day basis. Unfortunately we need more hands.Its not trash from locals dumping here, it just washes from the oceanGive us a hand, pick a little bag and make a difference!!Adrian"
I thought it was the smell of wizz and dead ballon hats ....Edited: 8 years ago 
I have never noticed the smell either. I do find the titleof the thread misleading and upsetting.
and over a year old ! I told my husband this morning I didn't think he left our bathroom smelling like the east side of Coz AT ALL !!!!!! So nope never noticed a human waste smell over there !
