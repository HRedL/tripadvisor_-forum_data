"UK government looking to extend quarantine rules to Greece as covid has spiralled, well who didn't know that would happen, as I have posted before all we had to do was right this year off and hopefully get back to some normality next year, never mind some 40 thousand people have died in the UK of the virus, who cares as long as they can have their 2 weeks in the sun"
"Yes, had to get the ‘I told you so’. Clearly you haven’t booked any holidays this summer, so why post this under Rhodes Greece in the first place. We are all aware of the statistics. Perhaps you should consider what this is doing to the global economy too. Hotels employ thousands of staff who rely of tourists. Unemployment, losing your home, and not being able to feed your family is also a growing statistic. Shouldn’t the choice be for the individual booking the holiday to decide if they want to travel or not. I can catch the virus in Waitrose or Greece, and frankly the UK’s attitude towards wearing masks renders me speechless. The virus is out of control in the UK too. SEdited: 2:39 am, August 16, 2020 "
"For your information sasaron, was booked to go to Rhodes in June as i do every year but it was cancelled by jet2 so in future please get your facts right about before you post"
"Hi.Over the pass day greek authorities announced 230 new cases and 3 deaths. UK had 300 cases in one factory in Northampton. So if it's spiralling in greece what's your headline for the UK. Total cases in greece is 6,858 with 226 deaths. Read a greek news paper to get your information. If anyone should be put on a quarantine list it's uk traveling to Greece. I hope it doesn't happen because of many friends who have business on rhodes. When I was in lindos in July they were really struggling and there best month of September when many UK return to the island. Peter.Edited: 3:33 am, August 16, 2020 "

Yes but if you were due to go anytime soon you probably would not put up such a condescending post. I have a holiday booked for next week - it was transferred from a holiday to Portugal that was booked last year as I couldn’t get my money back. None of this is ideal but some people seem to be gleefully hoping things will happen. It’s weird this could ruin the tourism industry forever.
"Petedex Good on you for posting this, after all it is a travel forum , I'm waiting for all the Rhodes know-it-all 's to pipe up including Ex Pat's, they're the worse I'm sure they think there's no virus, Thanks for heads up."

"Petedex just read the updates, I know its only the daily mail reporting it atm but certainly won't take long for it to happen all those on here , you know which you are , need to have a reality check. See Daily Mail report , unable to attach link but its started, thanks for heads up, I was thinking of booking for October, I'll reconsider I think."
WOW!You don't read that very often.'Daily Mail' and 'reality check' in the same sentence. LOL
"If I read something in the Daily Mail, before rushing to post about it in a public forum, my self respect would insist on trying to find independent confirmation. This is a newspaper/website that has a history of making up/distorting information for over 100 years."
"Cases reported in Greece to make 7 day average from the covid worldometer9th Aug 202, 10th Aug 126, 11th Aug 193, 12th Aug 235, 13th Aug 204, 14th Aug 251, 15th Aug 226 = total 1437104.1 (number of 100,000's people in the population of Greece)so 1437 / 104.17 = 13.79 as the rolling averageIt is clear to see if numbers keep going up and those small figures of the 9th and 10th of August are replace by much larger figures that rolling average is going to rise.But as previously said that if the 20.0 rolling average is the key to quarantine then the cases will need to rise to 300 before it is reached.but could easily happen if the rises continuesEdited: 5:07 am, August 16, 2020 "

"@#12Precisely.And it would also appear that the rise in infections in Greece is not the result of selfish holidaymakers with no thought for the locals but infection spikes in parts of the country well away from tourist areas.There is so much nonsense being written on here about this - both the Greek and UK governments will take any action based on scientific evaluation of the data when it becomes available.It's not incompetence or poor judgement but hard-pressed politicians having to take difficult and unpopular decisions to save lives while at the same time trying not to decimate their economies.It's not a judgement call I'd like to make.Edited: 5:22 am, August 16, 2020 "
"How condisending of you to suggest people are not caring about the deaths, I work for the nhs and have worked all through this pandemic. And if I can get away for two weeks sun and relaxation I will, just to sit in the sun and forget about all this. I am going in two weeks time if I can and will come back home battery recharged and destressed."
"Presently in Rhodes. Enjoying the sun, the Greek food and quiet beaches. The Greeks are glad of our custom. More social distancing here than at home. Everyone careful. Not sure the point of your post."
"We are chilling out right now in the wonderful socratous garden in the old town, i best not post what I am drinking as I have already been accused by the op as being beyond shameful for asking the price of a beer on the island on a previous thread, tomorrow we shall be heading to Symi for a few days and exploring this wonderful part of the world, if the UK government puts Greece on the list I will do the right thing and quarantine when we get back its not a big issue, but i find anyone who spends the time to post on a destination forum when they are not even going, a little odd, if you don't feel its safe for you to travel i fully respect that but dont nit pick at others that feel they are comfortable travelling."
"Supposed to be leaving for Rhodes this thursday but my husband said it might be added to the quarantine list. If that is the case, what are the policies with LAST MINUTE.COM for a full reimbursement. I paid in full. The hotel wanted to be paid in advance even though booking.com stated the hotel could be paid when I got there. Do you think the quarantine will extend to Greece by the 21st?"
"Most Governments including the UK take their lead on infection rates from ECDC, most of their info is published into the public domain.https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/enThe link below takes one to the 14 day rolling average of infections per 100,000 for the EU/EAA & the UK as can be seen from the link below Greece has already breached the so-called 20 cases per 100,000 threshold.https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaI'm sure other factors are taken into consideration, but the 20 per 100,000 does appear to the trigger for a closer look."
the 20.1 refers to a 14 day roll over and not the 7 day as said to be used
"Delboy, thanks for your figures and a breakdown of how you come to that. I’m hearing others say that the 7 day figure was around 18 but it doesn’t appear to be correct if this is how you work it out. See what the next few days figures bring but I’m hoping that it might stabilise with these new measures in place or even just not rise so rapidly."

">>> the 20.1 refers to a 14 day roll over and not the 7 day as said to be used <<<=======If you had read my post carefuly, I made it clear it was a 14 day rolling average. I also said that is trigger point to have a closer look, which it is. Not a descision making point. Other data will be looked at and considered too, most notably the rate of rise.Edited: 11:55 am, August 16, 2020 "
People are getting confused if 14 day rollover data is quoted. I was just pointing out if 7 is used it does not help people to understand
>>> It's not incompetence or poor judgement but hard-pressed politicians having to take difficult and unpopular decisions to save lives while at the same time trying not to decimate their economies. <<<======You could have fooled me.The UK Government has made a complete and utter barns @rse of the whole situation. Their treatment of care homes early ondwas borderline dereliction of duty.History will be a cruel mistress to this particular cohort of Governing politicians.
Daily Mail and the Mirror quoting the 14 day figure and using it in the wrong context doesn’t help but I suppose you can expect no less from mail journalism.
"Why so angry?! If you read the daily mail article, it hardly mentioned Greece. The UK is still getting more infections then Greece, yes the number is high for Greece because they’ve kept it under control. It is based on the 7 day average and that is why places like France and Spain have gone back on the list.I am staying positive for my holiday to Greece in SeptemberEdited: 12:30 pm, August 16, 2020 "
Nothing any of say or do will change a decision which is going to be made by Government based on their criteria. No point in worrying unduly about things we can't control.
"I’m working out the rate to be about 13.8. If Greece was to see an increase of 40% over the next week that would still be 19.3% and under the government’s ‘criteria.’ I don’t see the rate going up by 40% in the next week or so. Maybe 25% before levelling out. Which would make it 17.3% next Saturday. My maths is pretty average so please feel free to correct me if you think I’m completely wrong! Families have holidays booked to Greece and the government knows this. Children who don’t have the virus but have been in Greece wouldn’t be able to return to school. I think if quarantine was to be put in place it wouldn’t until the 1st September, and the rate would be dropping then as the season comes to an end. I fly this week and my children and I are back at work/school on the 1st September!"
#30 I know nothing is definitive and there are so many factors but I agree with your logic and think it is reasonable outcome to expect. I guess time will tell...
"people.need to calm down greece need a rolling average of approx 300 dor 7 days to go on quartine list with figures of around 210 at present this would need a full week on 300 so a 50% rise , all things being equal this will not happen in auagust.There will be peaks.and troffs but unless there is a major surge its not going on the list .I go in a weeks time for a week and am 99% confident there will be no quaratine in August so stop.worrying what you read in the press and look at the facts not what someone prints to sell views"
chrissymidnight- agreed!

I get what your saying marty. Re the mathematics of it was just trying to get across to people the stats are not as dire as the papers want you to believe and it will take a massive spike for greece go on the quarantine list which is not likely in the next month.But who knows could spike today . But I wouldn't be worried if your back before September
Thank you everyone kids really looking forward to it on friday xx

As such the situation could easily be very different in a week let alone a month. Hopefully that won't be case and everything will remain stable as it now. However, given its potential to spread in that manner its hard to be entirely confident that it could'nt rise to levels in a months time that cause the UK Government to act. Given the current bunch are not known for making balanced and neasured decision making, its something to be cognisant of.Edited: 6:33 am, August 17, 2020 "
In Rhodes now. Social distancing has been interesting and in somecases non exsistant. Today we put it down to different nationalities because some countries have had more and stronger social distancing measures than others. So to us it's poor but others haven't had it like the UK or other countries.
Number well down today . Well done greece see u soon
"We fly first thing weds morning. Been weighing it up, and frankly, there's no way to know if we'll be added to the list or not, it's all conjecture and speculation. We've had our wedding, honeymoon and a trip to Slovenia and Italy cancelled this year, so we're off to Lardos to see our friends and the place we love and if we do end up having to quarantine when we get back, so be it. We've no kids and are lucky enough to have jobs where we can get away with being at home for two weeks if necessary. I really feel for those that can't do so and have such a horrible decision to make at the mo."
"If one wants the current low down on the Cv19 infection rate in Greece, start the video below at about 18:15 on the video Dr. John Campbell published yesterday. Dr. Campbell has been analyzing data and giving public health updates in his daily videos since the start of the pandemic, I always find his videos a very informative watch irrespective on which territory he choses to concentrate on and they come recommended.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBPwEuWVbXQ"
Everyone is assuming the UK Government will be working to the 20.0 rolling average but if the UK figures drop they may even reduce the 20.0 from other countries in the coming weeks to keep the virus lower in the UK
>>> Everyone is assuming the UK Government will be working to the 20.0 rolling average but if the UK figures drop they may even reduce the 20.0 from other countries in the coming weeks to keep the virus lower in the UK <<<=======Quite.I suspect they use a number of metrics. As the infection drops the 'rate of rise' stat becomes increasingly important and I venture that becomes a significant player in any decision.
"Here's hoping. Either way, I'll be in the square in Lardos with a beer tomorrow night!"
Hi.Most of us have spent 3 plus months in quarantine I'm sure I can do 2 weeks after a lovely holiday. Peter.
