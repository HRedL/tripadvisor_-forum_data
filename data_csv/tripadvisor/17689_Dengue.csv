What is the present dengue situation in Reunion?
"The epidemic is ongoing, although mainly in the south and west. There have been about 6000 cases reported since the beginning of the year. As right now is southern hemisphere winter there should be somewhat less mosquitoes around to spread it however."
Thank you!
