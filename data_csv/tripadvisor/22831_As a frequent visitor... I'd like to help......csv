I've seen threads for particular restaurants and their workers... and that is certainly needed.... but are there any charities established to help with food and other needed services for NYC folks who have lost jobs for various reasons that non-locals like me could give to and know that the funds were getting where they are needed? NOT as specific as one particular chain of restaurants if possible. Thanks so much.
"Probably any of the established food banks/pantries, as that is where ANYONE who needed food would likely go, and they always need money. Unfortunately, I don't have the names of any on the tip of my tongue, but they shouldn't be hard to find.My neighborhood group, the Turtle Bay Association, received a specific request from a doctor at Bellevue (who may live in the hood) for phone chargers and/or phones. Folks often arrive at ER with their phones but no charger and hospital personnel usually can charge them for them. But now there is an overwhelming need, esp since family and friends are not allowed in to see patients and phone is how most of them communicate. In this case a donation box has been set up in our neigborhood, but something anyone who wants to help could think about is finding out whether a hospital near you could use this kind of help, and if one could, find out how to donate new or used chargers/phones."
"One nonprofit food bank I'm aware of is Food Bank for New York City --foodbanknyc.org. Another one I've heard of is Community Pantry, don't have their web address handy."
"Actually, I think I got that second pantry name wrong -- believe should be NY Common Pantry."
"I just read about this GoFundMe page for the EMS workers at FDNY station 7, they need food for meals etc:https://tinyurl.com/s4uy8nw""Our goal is to sponsor at least one meal a day for the next two weeks for the EMS workers in our neighborhood (there are three shifts of 30 people per day). The EMS workers are working 16 hour shifts, four days in a row, and some are even sleeping at the station. This is an important opportunity to support our local restaurants, as well as our FDNY EMS Station neighbors who are on the front lines fighting against COVID-19."""
"There are some ideas in these threadshttps:/…106256073https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g60763-…Edited: 5:33 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Great question GinnyNM, I am also a frequent visitor and will be looking at the links provided to help myself."
How about taking care of people where you live? How many restaurants are open in Chesapeake or Montreal?
"EricH_DC, I am already taking care of people and buy local to help my community.Most restaurants are closed but offer takeout and delivery.The numbers in Montreal are nowhere close to the ones in New York City, the city I love and want to get back as soon as possible.There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to help the ones that are more stricken by the virus than we are."
One idea is to buy a gift card directly from your favorite restaurant to give them some cash flow.
"With regard to gift cards, that's fine if you just want to help and don't intend to use the gift card. But keep in mind that some restaurants may not survive this crisis and there may be no opportunity to use that card."
"And with regard to EMS workers, I don't know about this group, but many first responders are receiving meals and other food offerings from restaurants in their neighborhoods. Also, a HUGE number of ambulances and EMS crews, maybe hundreds, are being sent to NYC by FEMA to provide relief/ assistance. This is similar to some of the relief that was provided after 9/11/01 but it does take a bit of time to get going.Edited: 7:17 pm, April 02, 2020 "

Giving to charities is great but be sure to make sure the charity is legit. Scammers have a way of popping up at times like this and taking advantage. For example one website you can check to see if a charity is legit is: https://www.charitynavigator.org/to see if they are tax exempt with IRS https:/…tax-exempt-organization-searchIf you want to assist a specific restaurant you could check to see if they offer giftcards and purchase those for use on a future trip.
*** Giving to charities is great but be sure to make sure the charity is legit.***Ask the charity how much on the dollar actually goes to the cause.
"As jcmtl says in #8, helping locally should not preclude one from extending kindness beyond one's community. While Charity begins at home, it doesn't end there. The heart's capacity is limitless.With regards to helping the food industry, I like what organizations like Taste of Tribeca are doing, helping the restaurants feed ER workers, the effort is two pronged. There are many who are doing the same thing. I chose this particular one as my family are residents of the area. If you don't think the restaurant will survive (what a sad thought) many of them are selling restaurant memorabilia like T-Shirts (ie Bubby's, Khe Yo, Mamman.https://tasteoftribeca.com/love-tribeca/"
"In addition to the list on the Taste of Tribeca website in #15, here’s a link to an article about their GoFundMe that is raising money to provide meals from neighborhood restaurants for workers at the local hospital. There’s a link to the GoFundMe in the article.https:/…Here are links to long-established organizations that provide meals for people who can’t shop or cook for themselves:https://www.glwd.org/https://www.citymeals.org/https://www.cityharvest.org/2020/03/covid-19/"
@springerandy - is there a way to know what amount on the dollar is actually going to the charity
#17 - The Charity Navigator site (linked in #13 above) factors fundraising & administrative expenses and efficiency into its ratings
Here's an inspiring read on how one long established soup kitchen is handling the challenge https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/0…
"#17 -Charities also often disclose that info on their website or you can glean it by looking at their financial info (annual report, etc) to see what percentage goes to things such as advertising, administrative expenses or overhead."

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/reader-ce… Here's another idea for folks looking to contribute to something worthwhile. The more than 100 yr old and very legitimate NY Times Neediest Cases Fund (more often heard of around Christmas) is setting up a special COVID19 relief fund that will collect money to be distributed to several organizations on the front lines of COVID related relief activities. I assume this will be operated like the Neediest Cases Fund, with all administrative/operating expenses paid by the Times, not the charity. For more info, check out that link."
"Sorry, that link seems to be broken. I'll try to fix it. In the meantime, you can probably find it yourself by googling it."

Here is an article from Bravo TV where the host of Top Chef talks about how to support the restaurant industry.https://www.bravotv.com/top-chef/style-livin…
"I renewed my membership at the Met Museum. Normally, I would have done this when I had a trip booked and when I knew I'd get around to acrtually visiting. But decided to continue my memberships as a small act of supporting the arts (which is one of my main interests in NYC)."
"I have 3 shows set for May. One has been postponed for the Fall and have yet to hear about the other 2. I will still try to make the shows if they are postponed for a time I can go. However, although I am not rich enough to not ask for a refund for all the shows, I will most likely not ask for a refund from at least one of the shows.Still looking at all the charities, not easy to decide. I wish I could help them all."
"GinnyNM, what a great idea for a thread, thank you. It will brighten my day helping the city I love so much in a small way.QQ2, I read about the NYT Neediest Cases Fund and think it’s just the right place for me to contribute, thank you. I appreciate that the NYT is covering the admin and operating costs and that the causes being supported are legitimate and worthwhile. I especially love that Jose Andres’ World Central Kitchen is one of them.WCK is already, after just a couple of weeks, serving nearly 100,000 meals every day across America.You can read more about the efforts of their ChefsForAmerica emergency relief at:https://wck.org/chefsforamerica"
"mcwhippet: I have been giving to the regular Neediest Cases Fund every Christmas for decades. The money goes to solid charities that provide direct help to a wide range of people. One thing I have always liked about this fund is, once you've given, they do not start soliciting you for more. Never hear a word from them. It's up to me to take the initiative to do it every year."
"I was looking for something else constructive to do here about 10 days ago and decided to give blood. Because of the respect for social distancing etc, appointments were scheduled at 15 minute intervals and the earliest I could get was today. I went. A bit over a mile walk each way. They were very careful there. On the way home, for a meat fix I went to a very empty Shack Shack. Still had to wait while they cooked my burger. Point is, your hospitals at home might be in need of blood."
"On the news, they showed a place in the Brooklyn Navy Yard where volunteers were furiously making surgical gowns."
