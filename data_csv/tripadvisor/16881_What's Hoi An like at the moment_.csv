Are restaurants and shops closed at the moment? How normal is life in Hoi An right now - for locals and for foreigners?
"Some restrictions were lifted on the 30th, schools went back on Monday, from what I am told foreign restrictions are still on."
"Today's latest news from my friend living in HA : Some hotels have re-opened, most restaurants normally catering mostly to Occidentals are still closed, and so are the temples, pagodas and ancient Chinese houses of the Historic Quarter. No restrictions to Foreigners, but better wait that everything reopens"
"""....but better wait that everything reopens""Or more accurately - better wait until you can actually get a visa. ;-)And who knows when that will be..... :-(Scott"
"Thanks for the update. We were about to leave Hanoi for Hoi An in mid-March, and had to turn around and fly home. Fingers crossed flights are operating and visas are being issued by next March when we'll try again."
"Hoi An is now reopened to welcome domestic and foreign tourists after the Covid epidemic 19. However, before flying to Da Nang and moving to Hoi An or any Vietnamese city, you must declare Medical newspaper.Information to you!"
"No Foreigners can enter Vietnam, so I do not see a Foreigner flying to Danang, excet if he resides in Vietnam and is not arriving from a foreign country. As a French residing in Hanoi I can fly Hanoi-Danang, but I could not fly for ex Hanoi-Siem Reap-Danang"
"""Hoi AnÂ is now reopened to welcome domestic and foreign tourists after the Covid epidemic 19.""How's that going to happen, Bao?Seeing as Vietnam's borders are still closed?And 'after' the epidemic?Not likely.Scott"
