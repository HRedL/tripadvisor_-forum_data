"I have an upcoming trip to Sicily in May. I am worried due to current situation at Italy, thinking if I should continue with my plan or should cancel."
I read in Sicily they have only 7 cases of coronavirus.
Zan not one person here can tell you to go or not...read thru posts from other people in similar situations much sooner than your trips....not easy to sort thru all the links etc. but bottom line keep an eye on your flights and if they are operating...cost of canceling .....you probably can wait to make a decision until first part of April but of course depends on your plans and investment. Good luck.
"If it was only a matter of numbers, Milan would be safe too. I'm frankly astonished by people thinking they can get a definitive answer about a life-threatening disease on a forum based on anonymity and volunteering. The OMS couldn't be able to reply today, but people think that TripAdvisor is a better source."

"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I totally agree with you that thereâ€™s no definitive answer and I am also not hoping for a definitive answer! I believe forums are to discuss, share and exchange ideas. My expectation was to gauge the situation at Sicily if anyone is traveling there or already in Sicily."
Theer are multiple threads running on the same theme whre you can share experiences. As it is the forum is being subsumed by questions on coronavirus that no-one can answer sensibly.
