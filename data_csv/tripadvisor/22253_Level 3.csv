"#1Okay. This is a TCI travel forum. I posted current information about TCI. Level 3 means ""Reconsider travel"". I've reconsidered."
When the OP references a curfew and the increase in the travel advisory rating it infers a crime or safety risk. Other threads indicate that the OP believes there is a crime issue in T&C. I wanted to clarify that the increase from a 2 to a 3 travel rating was not due to a crime spree. Which is why I listed many popular tourist destinations that also had a rating increase. Virtually all the destinations rated by the US moved to a 3 travel advisory. There are only 11 destinations in the world that are a 2 or less right now. As travelers attempt to sift through SO much info regarding travel it’s important to be specific when possible.
"RE: OP, #1, #5 , #7 Do some research... in my opinion, this increase to Level 3 was tied to a recent death that happened as a result of being accosted and killed changing a tire on the side of the road. Any of us, Tourist or Local, could be accosted changing a tire on the side of the road. Information is not positive or negative, it's informative. Just ignore the Property and Business Owners who will try to silence you as they are understandably growing frustrated that their Cash Cow seems to be under the weather and not producing as much Golden Milk as usual. RE: #2: See #1 above. Information is not positive or negative, it's informative. There is some negativity and vitriol being ""spewed"" on this forum, but when I look in the mirror, I just see beauty, brains and rainbows... ;-)Stay Home and Stay Safe.Edited: 12:36 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Thank you Dagney. I was just searching recent crime and came across the murder of the man on Leeward Highway by ""masked men in a dark car"". https:/…I loved our stays in Provo. This would have been our 5th year in a row. I'm really sad to make the decision to cancel."
If you read the US travel advisories site it clearly addresses the increase. To imply this is crime related is false. If you look at the site you will see MANY popular destinations were bumped up. And it doesn’t take much effort to find the information regarding the specific reason ALL these destinations were impacted. The change in travel rating is not due to crime.
"Lisa, I agree. Be safe."
#10Not false. Me thinks thou dost protest too much.
"Thank you, Irish-fan."
"This is the strangest of posts. I don’t protest....I’m stating facts. On Aug. 6th, 2020 the travel ratings of MANY places were increased due to COVID. Here’s the link to the info:https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travelI seldom post b/c I leave the lunacy to people who have the time for it. But this post was misleading which was then backed up with.....misinformation. When there are facts available use them."
"RE: #10, #12 I know that the murder happened around 11:00PM on August 5th. You are stating that the State Department advisory threat level raised to Level 3 on August 6th. I am telling you why I think the level rise was tied to the murder, why do you think it was not? Just because other destinations were increased to, or are resting at, a Level 3?The rise in COVID + cases was completely foreseeable and avoidable. The people that think it's OK to travel internationally during a pandemic, are the same people that think the virus is overblown and if they feel OK they are virus free and don't need to take the precautions that the ignorant sheep (their words, not mine) are taking. 13+, 12+, 29+ ... anyone still arguing that this is local spread, and not caused by the influx of tourists, is kidding themselves.Stay Home & Stay Safe!"
"Lisa M - Hopefully we’ll see you next year. The site you are relying on for your decision offers no information about travel to the USA.Okay, this is a Travel Forum, I live in the Turks & Caicos Islands. I want to travel. I need to go to New York. Where would I find similar information about the Level of Fear and reasons which I should consider or reconsider going to New York?I don’t have time to dig thru forums. Due to where I live, I also know, for a fact, just how twisted forums can become with erroneous mis-information posted by person(s) who do not live there nor even visited for years.Dagbey - The incident you refer to happened at 11pm on the 5th. Do you really believe that had any effect on our Level 3 upgrade the very next day? But okay, please ignore me, I just moved in 32 years ago.Edited: 6:06 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"#15. We know, for a fact, this latest increase is locally spread through contact tracing."
Dagney...click on the link I provided. It literally spells out what the NEW rating is in reference to and lists TONS of destinations impacted. And it’s irrational to believe an event on 8/5 influenced the change in travel rating. I have zero issue with calling out the increase from a 2 to a 3. But it should have been communicated factually. It takes a few minutes of due diligence before posting to be sure you’re accurately reporting on something as specific as a travel rating.
"#17 Huh? What ""latest increase"" is known to be locally spread through contact tracing? 3 days ago, if I remember correctly, something like 60-75% of those cases had no epidemiological links. Even if, somehow, the cases yesterday, about which I have not inquired, do have epidemiological links to other cases, it's impossible to know that all of the cases over the past 3 days are/were caused by pre-July 22nd on-island virus, and statistically, it's much more likely that new positive cases were flown in after July 22nd (statistics can be manipulated, but numbers don't lie). The incidents on North Caicos are extremely informative.Stay Home and Stay Safe!"
"#10, #14 We all have it all wrong. ""Curfew"" is a trigger word for some here and no matter what the OP hears will insist she's right. Just like any fire should be considered as arson for insurance fraud. I agree there is zero basis in fact to claim the curfew being reimposed is a response to crime or anticipated crime. I would bet the crime rate is actually down since Covid shut the TCI down. But consider Mr. Heinlein's "" Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig."" Which is a metaphor to explain the difficulty and pointlessness of communicating a lesson that an individual is unwilling or unready to learn."
"We know, for a fact, these latest cases are related to local transmission due to the island, area, address, last name, car, boat, work place, church, parties, meetings, restaurants, bars, families, daddy, siblings, cousins, nanny and potcakes.Nevermind that ALL visitors, with the exception of one young man, arriving by plane last week had tested negative within five days of arriving here. Hmmmm ... What happens if they return home testing positive?#19 I am home."

"#23I guess you don't consider staying safe from crime part of health and safety. Your problem, not mine. A vacation is not worth risking my life over."
"#14, #18 You posted a link to the CDC website, how about looking at the US State Department Website which is where Travel Advisories normally are? I'll add the link below:https:/…TurksandCaicosIslands.htmlThe US State Department has issued the TCI a Level 3 Reconsider Travel. In the Box on the Top, to the right of the warning, you will see letters in a circle --- One is a C for CRIME, the other is an H for Health and the C is actually listed First. Obviously, they are both relevant, and in my post #8 I said I believe that the increase was ""tied to"" which means it is a contributing factor. I stand by that opinion. Do you happen to know the nationality of the victim from August 5th?The ""C"" Bubble at the State Department says, among other things: ""Widespread Violent or Organized crime is present..."" Those are Facts. Now, I Do Not agree that the TCI ~ should ~ have a Level 3 alert for COVID OR Crime, but it is what it is.Re: #21 Obvi you're home... the WhereWhenHow Avi & Providenciales location sort of blows your cover... that said, even if you are a Full Time Island Resident, until this virus is more under control, you ~are~ Safer @ Home! ;-)Stay Home and Stay Safe!"
#27 the crime language was there when the TCI was at level 2.
"#27I linked to the U.S. State Department in my OP and frankly, I resent people telling me I am spreading misinformation and should do ""due diligence"" (not you, Dagny, you know who). Nobody else in here pointed out the change in status before my post. And I don't care what the Travel Advisory status is in other countries right now, I don't have a vacation booked in other countries."
"Lisa M you are getting push back because you insist the curfew is crime related and the level 3 advisory is crime related. There are not. They are both due to Covid, not crime. https://www.facebook.com/OfficeOfPremierTCI/"
"Happybubbles,Only you and someone from MN are giving me pushback. Countries and cities don't impose curfews unless they are attempting to shut down crime. You can continue to live in your little bubble of denial, but facts are facts and Dagny pointed them out quite clearly. Give it a rest. DeNile is not just a river in Egypt."
Lisa M and Dagny too. Read the Premiers statement of 7 August available on Facebook linked below. https://www.facebook.com/OfficeOfPremierTCI/
The level 3 travel advisory has to do with Covid. It is like that across the board.
"#31, #33 Think about what you are saying... there was a murder on August 5th, US State Department Threat Level increase on August 6th and the Premiere had a press conference on August 7th. As the Leader of a Tourist driven island, what is the responsible thing to say? That crime is out of hand and may get worse because the pandemic is leading to economic instability? Or to say that the Curfew is all COVID related (while also increasing police presence)? There is some precedent for a crime related curfew... remember last year when drive thru ATMS were turned off late night til early morning? I think it reasonable to imagine that crime is factoring in to some of these decisions. Does having a curfew so people can't hang out and drink well into the evening help stop the spread of COVID? Sure, but to say that the local leaders have not noticed or tried to formulate solutions to the crime problem is just arguing to argue.Look at what Trump said when the pandemic started... something like ""we have 15 cases, but this is going to go away, quickly... like a miracle... we closed the borders to China early"". Leaders/Politicians do not always tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I've said everything that needs to be said. I think people should have relevant information to make informed decisions, but I am not going to argue to argue. Peace Out. Stay safe and Stay home!"
"#32 ""Countries and cities don't impose curfews unless they are attempting to shut down crime.""This is a patently untrue statement. You would like people to believe that the crime has risen so there is now a level 3 advisory on the TCI due to crime. This is false. Not only false but misleading as the reason is Covid related."
"#35 and yet none of the crime activity this or last year changed the State Department level from 2 to 3. To site a single incidence one day prior to changing the level is not really sound logic or rhetoric either. So what was so special about this last murder on Provo that caused the State Department to immediately focus on the TCI and up the level to three? When the ""C"" for crime has been on their website for years?"
Pm and post 35. Everybody reading these. Don ever believe the suggestions from someone from from from Long Island with regards to visiting NYC. They are not the same. A lot of people......from the island (but not all) want to at like they know everything about the NYC.....but they don’t.....they live on Long Island. Not a bad place. But not NYC...........
"#37 There is another thread active now, this situation is also being discussed, the post is informative, it may even be enlightening :https:/…107538953"
"The Spin Doctors song "" Lil Miss can't be wrong "" keeps popping up in my head. Huh, go figure."
"#35 Dagny if crime were increasing don't you think we would hear about it? There is nothing in TCweekly, Sun, magnetic media etc. or Numbers for that matter. If you and Lisa M want to believe your own conspiracy theory have at it but promoting the notion that crime is so out of control they called a curfew is both uncalled for and dangerous."
"The entire Caribbean is stage 3, including anguilla that has had only 3 cases total and covid free for monthsState advisories don’t update within a couple of days of 1 crime happening, and don’t change it over 1 crimeThe true source, video from the the actual premier, you can hear the words come out of her mouth directly, Covid is the reason for the curfew. Some of you can’t see the true source when it hits you in the faceHow can you dispute the premiers own words on video? It’s not clearer, best true source than directly from premier. You can go to Facebook official page and listen for yourself. It can’t be any clearer!"
"Yup, I’m from MN. Giving someone “push back” because I offered a factual difference of why the travel advisory was changed. I’m guessing Anguilla’s change in advisory was due to violent crime as well. Probably same in the Caymen Islands. St. Lucia, Nevis, Aruba, etc....ALL CRIME. Again, the advisory change is Covid related. It’s seriously spelled out on the website very clearly. If certain individuals want to avoid travel due to crime or Covid related matters so be it. I’m a bit astonished that the same posters have literally over taken this forum. These same individuals post opinion as fact. And seem to never stop posting. Simply checking this forum periodically has most people acutely aware of who is unreliable."
#43You seem hyperfocused on Anguilla. Did they also impose a curfew?
"#41The changing of the Travel Advisory Level to a 3 and the implementation of a curfew within days of each other, is NOT a conspiracy theory. If TCI wants to bring back tourists, imposing a curfew on top of a Level 3 Travel advisory is not the way to do it. Simple as that."
How could there be a murder and then the travel advisory gets changed the next day? How fast do you think our government works? (Hint: not that fast.)
All the places to visit that are currently at a level 3 due to covid. https:/…map-and-travel-notices.html Turks and Caicos level 3 due to covid. https:/…coronavirus-turks-and-caicos
"From the State Department Travel Advisory:""Country Summary: The vast majority of crime occurs in Providenciales. Local medical care and criminal investigative capabilities are limited. ""We stay on Providenciales. I also planned a day trip to North & Middle Caicos, I hope I'll be able to get my money back for the ferry and jeep rental. You folks can go on and on and on about Mr. or Mrs. or Ms-C19, but at this point, I have survived lockdown in NY. I still follow all of the masking and sanitizing protocols. The risk of becoming infected in TCI from Covid-19 is not my main concern. CRIME is my main concern and reason for cancelling. Y'all can kneel at the alter of Dr. Fauci, but he has been wrong several times. I saw him sitting in the stands of that baseball field with his mask around his neck. Rules for thee but not for he. At this point, imho, Covid is just an excuse to control the masses and make people give up their freedoms. Disagree with me all you want, I really don't care. My PhD son-in-law (biomedical engineer) is working on a study of hydroxychloraquine with Northwell Health. It works. Had I decided to keep my reservations, I probably would have taken hydroxy as a prophylactic 2 weeks prior to our arrival. I know that roundabout near Beaches well. We always rent a car when we visit. Condolences to the family of the man who was murdered. There is also always the chance of stray bullets. Provo's police force is tiny. It shouldn't matter if the person murdered was a local or a tourist, they're dead just the same. And after 5 months of unemployment, there's no way you can tell me robberies haven't increased. I'd be willing to wager most go unreported because they know who is committing the robbery.So you can bash me all you want for my reasons for cancelling, have at it. This is a travel forum. I was a traveller to TCI with pending reservations. When my State Department says ""reconsider travel"" for whatever reasons (C, H) I reconsider. Besides, weren't half of you gloating over Americans not being allowed in a number of countries? I thought you'd be thrilled I'm cancelling .... LOL"
Make sure you wash that hydroxy down with a glass of bleach. Just to be doubly safe. (joking of course)Where would we be without the vast knowledge of your 4 trips and political insight.

Yes. I thinking canceling your trip is the best decision. Probably best if you don’t rebook either. We are not the place for you.
"#53Ah. So with your 30 posts and zero reviews, you speak for all of the hotels, resorts and restaurants on Provo? That's good to know. What is the name of your business so I know to avoid it when we do return?"
"OP: Thank you for reporting. I saw on one thread someone trying to tell you how to spend your discretionary income. Definitely not cool. Maybe they should pay for people’s trips? People on this forum seem to know more than the US State Dept. and other govt. officials and doctors.Dr. Jim: Thanks for your medical updates.All others, just go into 8/7/20.edition of TCI Sun newspaper, epaper.suntci.com; go to pages 6 and 7. There is a listing of all 2020 crimes. Probably not all.TCI weekly epaper also has 8/7/20 edition, has a listing under crime and court.TCI Magnetic Media also has several reports.Edited: 10:44 am, August 09, 2020 "
"Lady, you have an issue with the crime you think is so bad. I can tell you it isn’t going to get better anytime soon, so stay home. No need to spend money on a place you scared to be. You wouldn’t come to my place anyway, been my experience tourists stay in the hotel area and don’t come where they have too many of us hanging around. And with the things you say about my home, don ‘t want someone like you coming in and looking down your nose at my people.And I may only made 30 posts but we been watching this forum for a while now. I don’t speak for them Graceway boys. You think they care about us? No, they only care about they dollars . They don’t want to upset they guests by making them follow our laws and wear masks. What they worry about? They safe. We the ones in danger of getting sick. Trust me plenty people here not happy."
"#57: Such a shame you are going thru this. Recommend going to the appropriate officials and try to straighten out. It is your country, not ours. Go speak to whoever are the Grace Bay boys and the police. Again, it is your country. Tourists need to feel safe."
"There you are Numbers! You're welcome. I'm in the process of sending out emails to get my refunds. I think I'll call Delta tomorrow to see if they'd rather give me a credit or a refund, I'll take either."
"OP: For your review, wrote something on the American Airlines Return Flight Cancelled thread. It is what it is. You made a wise choice. Until things change, graveling is not a current pleasure coming from the New York area. And then, some do not understand, we spend $10-15,000 for all of this. Usually more if flying a family of five down. Way more. For 8 days, no cooking. Now 2 weeks, maybe. Part of the charm is dining in some of their restaurants and meeting people."
Nobackchat. I wouldn't want us in your country either. Especially now.
"Numbers,I would never fly United or American Airlines after the times they dragged folks (alive and dead) down their aisles in front of other passengers.

"OP: Wow. Never saw that. I had two girlfriends that were supervisors of flight attendants on long-haul flights at United so I sorta know the drill. What stories! Some of my posts have been taken down by TA. Sorry. Again, the truth always prevails and economic, business revenue matters. People need to get a grip on that one. I am a business woman. If the T&C residents do not like what is going on, it is their issue to go to the government officials and straighten out, not this forum. Also, those on this forum who opine, are they flying down to T&C, nope. They just want everyone else to, I have to assume they own property there so ..... n TA you are not suppose to advertise, well, they do in an Indiscreet way. Now, some might pay for advertisement which is getting TA to accept reservations of which they might receive 10% (not sure) of the accommodation rate. Who knows? Does not matter. Not safe currently flying plus a hassle.Glad you purchased a home generator system. They are great."
Lisa M....you mentioned I’m focused on Anguilla and asked if they have a curfew too. I didn’t ever mention Anguilla on its own but did indicate it’s also a level 3 advisory. And Anguilla isn’t reopening to tourists until Oct. 31st at this point. Just like all the other Caribbean destinations it was bumped to a 3 recently due to Covid.
"Lisa M, Shusun the language ""Country Summary: The vast majority of crime occurs in Providenciales. Local medical care and criminal investigative capabilities are limited. "" is exactly the same language when the TCI was at level 2. While there is crime especially on Provo it rarely involves tourists. The TCI is still one of the safest destinations in the Caribbean. If you exercise common sense you will not have a crime problem visiting the TCI. The level 3 designation which virtually most locations is now at is due to Covid, not some drastic increase in crime. A Curfew in the TCI is not the same as a curfew in 1968 Detroit. With a small police force the only way to control crowding and gatherings is to have a curfew which running from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM will have little impact on tourists. Lisa M be prepared to be shocked, shocked I tell you when you find out how much fuel your new home generator uses. Embrace the power outage, think of it as camping out. After Gloria on LI we were out of power for three weeks. When Ike hit GT we had no power for two months. Sorry the TCi won't see you this year."
"Happybubbles,We have street gas. I don't care how much it costs to run the generator if it saves a refrigerator full of food and runs the heat or A/C as needed."
"#66Hey, you were the one who brought up Anguilla for comparison, so I guess the answer is NO, they don't have a curfew. Thanks for playing."
"<< “ If you exercise common sense... “ >>Well, there’s yer problem right there.:-)"
#70Go make ice cubes. :-)
"#67: Your analogy against Lisa ... a joke. One’s primary residence is the most important. Flying for a vacation is another story. Most people go away, to get away, not deal with more issues. Do you now understand? I personally think it is great, entire home generator! Makes life easier and they can afford. Who wants to worry about all these things on vacation? Everyone, spend your hard-earn $$ the way you want. No one gave anyone the right to tell you how to spend your discretionary cash.I hope #67 has already flown down to T&C, staying for a month and spending their $$ there to help out the economy. They would love it. Go in season or pay the higher rates. It helps to add to the 10% mandatory service charge ... the workers can make some $$.Plenty on this forum that opine go during the “low season”.Edited: 7:11 pm, August 10, 2020 "
"Oh, even a better one. Everyone can boast to their friends and family, going to T&C. The world is aware that grace bay beach is number one and when they look up the rates for accommodations p, tax, service charges, expected tips and airfare, most cannot afford such an extravagant vacation. Some can, good for you. No jealousy here."
"#72 thank you for your insightful yet seemingly random stream of consciousness analysis. Completely wrong but insightful and entertaining none the less. The deduction that curfew means crime is simply not correct and unfortunately at least one other person has now bought into this false and ignorant notion. No I do not understand. Please do enlighten us all. I have no opinion about what Lisa M does with her money. I am just telling her that the fuel bill will be surprising. I lived on Long Island for over 42 years. Many people got home generators after Gloria and Sandy and universally the comments from these people was about how much fuel they use. I lived in Suffolk which does not have a lot of gas mains. So people got propane only to find out the tank was empty after two to three days and couldn't get it filled quickly either. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. OK with you? We know you reserve unto yourself the right to tell people what to do with their money. #67 would never do this as he respects other people's decisions.#67 has been visiting the TCI on a regular basis for over 26 years but does not stay on Provo. #67 has waived rents due from an owned commercial rental property since January and for an entire year after Ike. Also 8 months after Maria and Irma. #67 has also donated to various charities in the TCI to the tune of over $5K post hurricane Ike. #67 has also put over $20K of his own money to date into the tenant business (that currently has no business) so staff can have a roof over their heads, food on the table and employment if things ever get back to normal. #67 routinely flies down for hurricanes to help people, friends and businesses set up for and rebuild after their passing. Hopefully these actions could be considered by yourself as helping out the economy. But I'll make sure to add to the 10% service charge next time I am there since I'm not so cheap as to tip just 10%. What have you done for the TCI lately other than to tell people not to go?"

My observation which was neutral and about the efficacy of small plant electric generation. It's remarkably inefficient which means nothing more than you may be surprised at how much it costs to run the unit. That's all. I'm sure you will enjoy the unit once it's in and running. The physics of power generation is not time dependent nor am I unfamiliar with using whole house generators. I have an 8KW here in Maine last used about 6 months ago. But I certainly do not miss the electric rates on LI which I left 4 years ago. Is that antiquated? Who cares? I'm not giving you advice. Be happy to is you want it. May as well try third person since Numbers still doesn't get it. Now even more so.Edited: 6:30 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"#77 the cause of the recent horse deaths are unknown. They are not the horses owned by Chukka who ran a tour for Carnival and abandoned them. Local volunteers are feeding these animals now. The horses that dies are all privately owned horses. The TCSPCA and the Gov't Vet are looking into why they died. They did not die from starvation. Want to help? Maybe donate some $$ to TCSPCA. But I suspect not. All talk. Crime ? Sure. Every place has crime. Lot less of it on GT than on Provo though. Thanks for the epiphany. Wow. You mean because the cruise terminal is shut down and the flights from Provo have now stopped for another three weeks this may effect tourism related income? Thanks Numbers, I never would have figured that out. Maybe if I had that map.......Both #76 and #77 could benefit from better reading comprehension skills. But I'll ask again.Numbers....What have you done for the TCI lately other than to tell people not to go?"
"Will write trip report upon return. Just got here Thursday with my husband and four kids. Booked before I thought things would go on this long and struggled on decision. Had Dr call Orders in- went thru hospital system where MyChart account is linked and the test was uploaded in 8 hours. Donned our masks and goggles on empty Delta flight, and currently at West Bay Club. Feel safer here than my town in CT. Guests wearing masks about property except while lying on lounge chair by pool or beach. They are doing an outstanding job. Few people here. We don’t roam around at night - have an early dinner at best. Dined at shark bite last night and were the only people on deck. Had an uneventful drive to grace way this afternoon where all were wearing masks. Security guard sprays your hands before you go in. Sunset is currently a level 10!"
#78 Blamona....Numbers needed to know as she alluded to me needed or perhaps was chiding me to go for a month so I could help the economy. I'd rather stay here for the rank hypocrisy being spewed by two of the posters here.
You didn’t see the videos of Chukka’s horse enclosure?
"TCKitty...that is wonderful to hear that guests are wearing masks at WBC! There was an earlier poster that stayed at SS stating masks were not required nor saw anyone while on the resort.Just curious, does WBC have signage up stating that masks are required?Enjoy your stay with your family!"
"#83 NoBackChat Thank you for posting on these forums. Please keep it up, A local perspective is very welcome. I have seen the video but the horses that recently made the TCWeekly news are not the same horses. There maybe some kind of disease or some kind of poison in the environment. No one knows yet. I wish Government would fine Chukka for the way they treat their horses and use the money to feed them . It's not the first time they've done it and there have been numerous complaints over the years about their treatment. It should not be solely up to volunteers to fix this problem."
TCKitty Thanks for sharing Great to hear from people who are actually THERE. Look forward to final trip report if you would be so kind to write one.
"I will check but they are so on point here with their set up to decrease contact. You scan your phone to QR code where you pull up all menus on phone. If you need anything at all you text from your phone to one number- when you want room cleaned, food drink- whatever. No buffet breakfast anymore but beautiful ready to order breakfast included. There is such a sense of respect here for each other it’s really nice to see the masks on everyone. Believe me- I was super high stress about traveling during pandemic. I normally fly direct on Jet Blue from JFK and back when I made reservation thought it would be better to fly out of local airport. I wasn’t thrilled with connecting through Atlanta but my connecting gate was directly across from first flight and there was barely anyone there. I travel for work and never went through that section - must have been international terminal."
I would be happy to! It’s our 20th year here and I have stayed all over but fell in love with WBC and have been here every August for ten years. Right now reminds my of what it was like ten years ago in August as far as number of people. Using the same caution here as I do while home and everyone has been super warm and welcoming everywhere we go.
Thanks TCKitty! It sounds like WBC is doing the best they can in this new travel world! I’m very impressed with the guidelines that WBC have taken to keep both staff and visitors safe. Enjoy!
"TCKittyMaybe start a new thread so your story doesn't get lost in all the inevitable clutter that the TCI Forums have devolved into? Yes I am guilty but not as expert as others. It so nice to hear a trip report instead of the ""don't go there"" nonsense. Glad you made it. Enjoy."

Did I hijack? I was trying to point out that even thought there was a level 3 it seems very organized and calm here if you are a visitor.
TCKitty...great point by HappyBubbles. It would be wonderful if you would start a new thread with your great info. Love your positive experience on Provo but unfortunately it might be lost on this thread. It would be great if you could share separately!!
I was trying to calm people by pointing out a positive experience. I have been on this site for many years but I am not sure what happened- people were always friendly and helpful and is become so controversial. To me it’s a positive topic in general. I am always happy to share negatives and truths as well but it’s just gotten really weird here.
"#94 That is very altruistic, but no one needs to be ""calmed"". All this forum needs is the free and fair exchange of useful and up-to-date information. If I understood the intent of the OP, the point was to advise that as of August 6th, the US State Department had increased the threat level in the TCI to 3.I agree that your experience @ West Bay Club, especially contrasted with the reported experience at Seven Stars (link below) would be generally helpful to travelers, but I also agree that posting your mini-""Trip Report"" in a thread titled ""Level 3"", might not be the most generally useful.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14739…I still believe that everyone is safest right now @Home.Edited: 12:40 pm, August 10, 2020 "
#92 Not at all. It's a public forum. Good on ya.
Dagny “ free and fair exchange of up to date and useful information”. I am giving you just that from the island as we speak. I’m sorry it’s not a nightmare story but it is what it is- calm. I respect anyone’s decision about travel during the pandemic. I have been here before during “level 3’s as well due to crime and am hyper cautious about what I do. Hope that people coming on trip advisor who are not a part of this established group continue to find help here.
"#97... you are the only one who mentioned a ""nightmare"" of any kind.In fact, I posted a link to your thread in the thread about Seven Stars not requiring guests to wear masks while walking about the property. My intent is, and has always been, to support the free and fair exchange of information. I was telling you that your positive report might actually get lost in a thread titled ""Level 3"". I was amplifying your positive report. A lot of people drink the kool-aid that I have some sort of negative agenda, which couldn't be further from the truth. Review my post history, you will see that Seven Stars is my favorite resort, but if they are not keeping people safe, then maybe a little public shaming will lead them to make a policy change. That was my point and purpose... as it is always: traveler and resident Safety.You can read my words in black and white @ the link below:https:/…107548668Stay Safe and Stay Home!"
"Dagny- I saw that and it’s very nice you wrote that. Some of us don’t spend a ton of time on here so if we violate your rules of how you like threads written it would be kind not to bite that person’s head off. I was unaware I was hijacking a thread as Lisa from Long Island pointed out. People hop on here looking for information. It definitely seems like you all have your own group with your own rules on a public forum so forgive me for not knowing them. Safety is extremely important to me and I wanted to point out that currently I felt very safe.Edited: 9:07 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Re: #99 I certainly have no ""group"" on this forum, nor do I have rules. Would it surprise you to learn that my post #8 on this thread, which violated no guidelines, was flagged as Inappropriate by the Community this morning, removed and reinstated? Additionally, did you notice that I did not post about the murder of the American on August 5th until other members, in earlier posts on this thread, were bullying the OP? Some of those posts are now removed, but that is what happened. If you support the free and fair exchange of information, then please continue to share your opinions and experiences, positive and/or negative, and I will continue to support you.Stay home and Stay safe!"
"#99 TCKitty... Please do not apologize. Wonderful to have a trip report You are not hijacking a public forum but unfortunately there are a few members here that think Trip Advisor is ""their"" personal property. I thought Lisa M was out of line but she is predictable which is why I suggested starting a new thread/topic. How DARE you step on her topic (sarcasm).People DO come here looking for exactly what you posted. Real honest information. The TA forums are supposed to be about travel info, just like you posted. But sadly most of the posts are from the same people, spouting the same negative opinions. People are not coming here to read pages and pages of regurgitated nonsense they are looking for exactly what you posted."
Thanks Dagny. This doesn’t feel free to me. It feels kind of stressful. I’m here now so if anyone needs help please reach out. Stay safe and stay sane!
Thanks Happybubbles. It’s been a while since I’ve spent a lot of time on here - I see what you are saying.
"I'm late in addressing this, but I'm so confused!On one hand we have #15 and #19, who works so hard for posts on TA, screenshot deleted posts and always working hard at reinstating her opinions. Someone working that hard has you believing what she says is fact, even when she's telling the Premier how to do her job. Speaks about crime and pandemic with such passion. When TCI was raised to level 3 I believe she believes it was 1 incident on the 5th, even when the entire world was raised to level 3 except Cambodia. She believe's so strongly that she almost makes me believe. She knows (yes knows) that TCI pandemic is spiked due to tourists. Such passion keeping up with posts I believe her!So the WHOLE world is upgraded to level 3 except Cambodia and the reason for TCI upgrade is suspect?Then we have #17 and #21. Lives on island 32 years. Is on the actual front lines. Knows many on island (hey it's a small island!) and knows the spike is traceable, and not to tourists.Such contradictions, who to believe?Then we have the boat parties with no social distancing or face covers. Coincidently cases increase, before borders are open.Then we have actually video straight from the premier (go to official FB page to see for yourself) and know that all cases except 2 are locals (her words not mine, sorry) and minister of health right after says majority of cases are Blue Hills, a non-tourist area, and islanders are not wearing face coverings. #17 works so hard reinstating posts, collecting old posts back up that were deleted at the time, making lists of what to do, so passionate that she almost convinced me!But #17 is so convincing that her opinion is the truth, that she debates #21 who lives there!So I think I just made up my mind, I'll believe #21 and the actual words of the premier.But thanks for trying!If we listen to the premier and minister of health, it sounds like islanders have a better chance of giving tourists Covid! I'm not confused anymore, just convinced myself to believe the person actually living on island."
I was thinking along the same lines Blamona. Thus why I am protecting myself in the exact same manner I would at home. I think the Premier has done an excellent job with tourists. It was really difficult getting in here and it s smart on her and the country’s part
"Simple answer..EVERYONE should wear masks. Why are you ( Blamona) ignoring the fact that tourists are not wearing them or asked to overall? I can’t believe how some people don’t understand. It’s what the premier has stated as also the Minister of Health.Edited: 9:55 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"I’m not ignoring the factsEVERYONE should wear masks, let’s be clearBut facts and opinions are different from each other as I stated as to where the cases are coming from and why it’s level 3And when did I say don’t wear a mask? Where did that come from?Again everyone should wear masks"
"Re: #104 and Others: Wishing, hoping and wanting something to be true, Does Not make it true.You know what is true? COVID-19 is spreading in the TCI, two weeks after Tourists were welcomed back, much more aggressively than before Tourists were welcomed back.Re: your relying on the Premier and the author of #17/21 to be the authority on COVID in the TCI, let me give you an analogy (I hope this makes things easier to understand):As of today, the US has almost 5 million cases and 161,000+ deaths. If Jane Smith, living on Main Street, Newton, Massachusetts USA thinks that those numbers are false, and that the virus is a political ploy/hoax that will go away the day after the election in November 2020, should we believe her because she LIVES in the USA? What if the US President tells us that we only have 15 cases and the virus will disappear quickly, like a miracle? Should we believe him? He IS the Leader of the Country, right?If the author of #17/21 lives on the island of Providenciales for 32 or 100 years, and states that ALL cases have known epidemiological links, and the Premier says that the transmission is local only, should we believe them? Like we should believe US Resident Jane Smith and the US President?Now, that said, do you believe US President Trump about COVID OR do you believe the US Centers for Disease Control (the CDC)? Because the TCI Health Department, which is close to the US CDC, states that the stats for ~only~ the past 3 days (I don't even have a Facebook account but I asked a contact who was giving me stats to get me an ""official"" source so I could post a link here) are:https://www.facebook.com/tcihealthpromotions8/9 19 new cases -- 18 known epidemiological link, 1 unknown8/8 27 new cases -- 21 known epidemiological link, 6 unknown8/7 29 new cases -- 18 known epidemiological link, 11 unknownThe website has more dates and more daily totals, with more unknown transmission.So, with all due respect to the Tourist based business owner/DE referenced in your post #104, I am going to get my stats from the TCI Health Department, like I'll get my stats from the US CDC, not Jane Smith or President Trump.And speaking of local spread coming from locals. Please direct me to the location of the Resort Staff Housing along Grace Bay Road. I know there was some staff housing built near Seven Stars, but, I believe that the rest of the staff employed in the majority of the Resorts on the island live in places on the Island where the virus is spreading. Just as I, and others, suspected. These workers are most likely taking the virus home from work as a potentially deadly present to their families.Would you like to share with the readers on the Forum how many of you posting on this thread/Forum own homes/property and/or businesses on the islands? How many work for the TCI government? I'll start... I own nothing in the TCI and choose to vacation there because I love the Ocean and the Residents (who I am trying to keep safe).Stay Home and Stay Safe!"
"To use #108 analogy, because #108 says it it must be trueWhen the ministry of health states majority of cases are in Blue Hills, and scolds residents there because they’re not wearing masks, and there’s videos of locals on boat parties not wearing masks, then going to work at a resort, logic will tell you your thinking is backwards—better chance of a local currently giving it to a tourist!You’re assuming and stating it as fact. You’re assuming because someone was not traceable it was a tourist. How do you know it wasn’t a local from blue hills who hasn’t worn a mask?See how that works?"
"Quoting #104 author of #109:""Then we have #17 and #21. Lives on island 32 years. Is on the actual front lines. Knows many on island (hey it's a small island!) and knows the spike is traceable, and not to tourists.""""Spike is traceable""?! Huh?! Here are two more dates from TCI Health... 8/6 12 new cases -- 1 known epidemiological link, 11 unknown8/5 13 new cases -- 2 known epidemiological link, 11 unknown...that's 22 untraceable cases in those 2 days, added to the 18 other untraceable cases referenced in my post #104 over the past 3 days (but it's definitely local to local transmission, right? transmitting virus that was on the island pre-July 22nd. That's not just wishful thinking?).And, PS: 1) that's not how analogies work, and, 2) don't believe #108 because I posted it, believe the stats of the Health DepartmentStay home and Stay safe!Edited: 2:17 pm, August 10, 2020 "

OP: I am sure you saw. For others the newest e-papers of TCI Sun and TCI weekly lists all 2020 crimes year-to-date. TCI Magnetic Media also has several media announcements. This should help for no fake news.
Pages 6 and 7 of the TCI Sun e-newspaper has the listing.
"#114 The curfew is as follows per the Premier. ""Effective Monday, August 10, 2020, the Curfew on Providenciales will be from 10 PM to 5 AM each day, and from 8 PM to 5 AM on North Caicos and Parrot Cay."""
"A side note, Parrot Cay has no crime, yet has a curfew. Currently closed through October tooMy opinion, but that leads one to believe it’s covid related (as the previous curfew on Provo was covid related too)"
"#117: Old news. Anyone who knows where Parrot Cay is located knows there is no crime; a tad remote. That is why when flying into PLS one has to take a car service and then a ferry there. Added costs. Great place to unwind. Just some added info, great place to stay for four days and then move over to Provo before flying home. Grace Bay Club and Seven Stars are two great resorts.Edited: 11:40 am, August 10, 2020 "
"I stand corrected on the Provo curfew as reported in the TCI Sun. Also, it is for 3 weeks starting August 10th (today)."
"I would appreciate an apology, #108, for the completely unnecessary and vicious personal attack. Do you think comparing what a person says on this forum to what your country leader says will endear you to anybody? You have seriously gone too far.The curfew is Covid related.Not everything makes the newspaper.You and your Ilk would just LOVE what doesn’t.The recent spread of cases is within our communities and coincides perfectly with certain events.No visitors arrived with positive tests for CV-19.With exception of one."
"#119: Do tell. What did not make the newspapers? I am sure some crime. Realize some Covid issues, too. Your govt. is doing a good job because you do not have the medical facilities for all Covid cases. It is what it is. What a mess! Gotta love people on these forums saying come to T&C. Yes, a hassle and then all of us tourists miss the beautiful beach. Hopefully things will get settled by 2021."
"Re: #119 -- There was no personal attack, viscous or otherwise. The author of #104 & #109 was quoting you as an authority on COVID case transmission in the TCI. I was stating that you, by virtue of living on the Island, are no more an authority than Jane Smith living in the US. I was making an analogy.I was also comparing relying on the Statements of the TCI Premier (the Leader of the TCI) to the Statements of US President Donald Trump (the Leader of the US). Making another analogy... and making the point that what Leaders/Politicians say is not always 100% reliable.I then provided a link to the TCI Version of the US CDC which was providing data that, frankly, contradicted you and the author of #104/#109 and stating that I think that the data from TCI Health is more reliable than statements from either you or the Premier. See... no insult: personal, viscous, or otherwise. Just a misunderstanding, it seems.Another misunderstanding: I never said the Curfew was Not COVID related. Ever. What I did say was that there was some precedent for a crime related curfew (ex: the closing of the ATM because of crime last year), to show that the OP's linking of the 2 could be a reasonable conclusion and Not a malicious attempt to sully the reputation of the Island. I also suggested that imagining that the TCI Government thought that the Curfew could kill two birds with one stone (stopping the spread of COVID and reducing crime, which tends to happen in the later/overnight hours), would also Not be unreasonable. Side Note: This is similar to my stating that the Level 3 rise could be ""tied to"" the August 5th murder. Meaning: Even IF the Level 3 threat level IS as a result of COVID, that is Not to say that IF there was No COVID the Level would Not have been raised. I am sure that by the time the Level was raised on the 6th, the State Department knew about the American murdered on the 5th. That does not mean that the Murder on the 5th ~caused~ the threat level rise on the 6th, but I am arguing that it was almost definitely known, evaluated and considered and it Could Have been the reason for the increase (absent COVID and, even if there was an existing plan to raise to 3 because of COVID).I agree that the spread of cases AND the increase/spike in cases coincides perfectly with certain recent events, and I posit that the infection/positive case graph, to me, demonstrates that it is more likely than not (with COVID there can be no certainty) that the spike is due to the entry of Tourists. Google a TCI case graph and see for yourself. Hope this educates and clears up the confusion.Stay home and Stay safe!"
"My request (#120) for an apology stands.Your lengthy attempt at explanation does not even match what you said.The misunderstanding is yours. Nowhere is anyone standing me up as ‘authority’ ever, actually. You owe Blamona an apology.You did make a comparison to me and Trump in paragraph 6. You owe him an apology, too. Saying I lived here 100 years (?) a total exageration. And I never said “all the cases are traceable”, your total fabrication. Unknown links are simply that.Do you ever reread what you write? You could save yourself alot of misunderstandings about the misinformation. My request for an apology stands."

"#123 and #124: please go into tci magnetic media and really read the entire news clip of today. Maybe this can calm things down. Bottom line, Covid and how to enter PLS airport for a resident or tourist. Everyone is having a problem. Stay home; stay safe. Sorry, their economy is going to suffer for awhile."
"re #124 Must you continue the personal insults. I now need to be armed on a travel forum? I am a DE and used to be able to share my spare time and knowledge with persons who were actually looking for help with their vacation plans.1. The word authority appears no where. I do not and never have held myself out as such.2. (omit)3. Then make the point without exagerations.4. I stand by my words. Probably should have included the word SOME, but it is very obvious that not ALL are traced and known. Those that are nameless were just a face in the crowd.5. AND again I said “arrived with a positive test”. You are taking great liberty to add and twist my actual words.I do not need links to anything Turks and Caicos.Again I am asking for an apology."
"For anyone interested and following this thread because of the Level 3 due to COVID, the new positive numbers for August 11th-August 12th are:17 new cases.... 11 with epidemiological links and 6 with unknown transmission.I am not sure who the ""unknowns"", who are ""just a face in the crowd"", are (or what exactly that means), but anyone on the island (or planning to go), should make sure that they follow all appropriate health recommendations: wear a mask, distance, wash your hands, disinfect and take care of yourself and others.Stay home and Stay safe!"

"I just wanted to take a moment to update this thread, since there was a lot of discussion about the State Department Level 3 designation re: COVID and/or Crime. Just today, a local paint and supply store on Leeward Highway in Providenciales, announced that because of a rise in crime, it is closing indefinitely. The exact language announcing the closure is: ""Will be closed from today August 31st, 2020 until further notice due to the alarming increase in crime.""Here is a direct link:https://www.facebook.com/tcipaintsupplyI am adding the posts below, so it's clear that this is a Tourist board and Tourists shop for all types of things on the Island:Tourist looking for a pull-out couch:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14739…Tourist looking for a Blow-up Air Mattress and/or Blankets -- suggestions were KB Homes on Leeward and/or Do It Centrehttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14739…Staying Home is Safer!Edited: 6:07 pm, yesterday "
If you two hate the island so much don’t come back and leave this forum. You have to be the two most depressing people around.
Silly me... last time I was looking to buy a pull-out sofa while on vacation it never occurred to me to shop at a paint store.
"RJP, priceless"
"#137--Love IT, agree !!"
"RE: #138 I do not make the rules, but I have learned how to abide by them. I could have added this to the Safety and Security thread, but since I believed this was more timely and appropriate, I added the information here.Just like with the increase in COVID, many TCI residents are unhappy with the increase in crime. Residents are probably more frustrated than tourists b/c we can choose to vacation elsewhere, but the disease and crime spread is happening where the locals live.There was disagreement about crime on this thread. I just pointed to a local source that agreed that crime is getting out of hand. Reading all of the comments on the company's page is actually more informative than the Closure notice itself.PS: #137 TurksInsiders and #140 TCILover the screen names really do say it all.I love the TCIs but right now, Staying Home is Safer!"
"Dagny - What is the motivation? You are not more advanced or knowledgeable than many people here. I agree that posts should be forthcoming re: ownership and personal interests when posting recommendations and with openness but not over dramatization re; crime but you are just as guilty of those you seem to act against. I can’t help notice that your posts increase just as “numbers” decreased. And when “numbers” went on TA vacation early this year, Lisa M suddenly came alive. As someone noted, a lot of heads here. I’m sure more heads will come out. If you have an axe to grind just be honest but don’t play the role of as some sort of moderator/educator. You’re not providing a service at least to me as a traveler on this forum. You need to start backing your stuff up before your dig up your old posts to distract and deflect. Just sayin’ - one mass hole to another"
