"COVID-19 related question. I'm just wondering want the local situation is. Here's the deal. I have to approve a travel request for two of my employees to travel to Huntington Beach for ""mission critical"" travel (that's the term that our organization is using for high profile projects that needs to keep moving forward). The people who will be going are willing to go and want to make the trip (younger, healthy guys). My knee jerk reaction is to not approve this travel request regardless of the importance. Maybe we can do most of it virtually (this is an inspection trip, so hands on the hardware is important). What are the current restrictions for Huntington Beach? Can folks traveling from Ohio make this trip safely for themselves and for the locals? These are smart guys so they will follow the rules (or they will answer to me!). I've done some searching on the net. A couple of official looking websites have not been updated since March (not helpful). The news indicates that the number of cases in currently increases, some saying significantly. There appears to be opposition to wearing face coverings. Just looking for the insight from the locals in order to help me make an informed decision."
"Here's your real problem. People from inland, LA, out of state arre hitting the beaches because they're still open. Had they closed half the battle would have been over by now. It's infuriating any Government would put their citizens health at risk.Truly we're on our own and can be as lawless as we want. Within reason."
"Safety first.The flights involve risk. The trips between airport and hotel involve risks. The trips between hotel and job sites involve risk. The ""free time"" involves risk."
"The LA Times puts Covid tracking by CA county outside its paywall. Another good data source is each county’s public health department. In many hotspot states it is younger people who are turning up positive. While on average they don’t get as sick, more and more of them are. And more and more are hospitalized. I believe I read than the media age in hospital in CA is now 41. I wouldn’t travel to SoCal now. But nor would I get on a plane, stay in a hotel or eat in a restaurant, even outdoors."
"Here is the official Orange County, CA website for Covid-19 info: https://occovid19.ochealthinfo.com/Here is the official City of Huntington Beach site for Covid-19 info: https://hbready.com/Both of these are up-to-date."
"Face covering required in ""high risk"" situations, esp indoors. Cases are spiking in Orange County. Restaurants are outdoor dining only.By the act of flying and staying at COVID hotspot of Southern Calif, your employees are exposed to very high risk condition. So face masks and hand washing and social distancing are de rigueur. Your ""smart guys"" better not be out drinking in the evenings or going to the beach. Fly out, work, fly back. It's not a vacation."
Thanks for the quick replies. Excellent information and points made. Very helpful!

"Also they probably should self quarantine for 14 days after they get home, whether your state requires it or not."
"My thoughts: If you have the option to not approve, meaning you are not under pressure from higher ups do not approve it. If one of them comes down with the virus after you have approved the trip it's on your head. You will be the one who approved it and you will be the one who will end up responsible. Pass the buck if you can. If not, do not approve. Young men are not immune.Edited: 12:52 pm, July 27, 2020 "
"My company is an essential business and we have people out in the field during COVID. We've stopped all non-essential travel, but some stuff just can't be done remotely. Field work is not part of my current role, and generally I miss it, but I am very grateful not to have to do field work now - I can stay safe in my office at home. In our case, we are an engineering firm that works primary with power plants. Our field work has to do with non-destructive examinations of piping and components, instrumentation to characterize vibrations in components, and that sort of thing. Some power plants are able to defer some of this work, but some cannot be deferred, so someone has to go out and do it. In your case, I would assess the impact if the field work cannot be done - ""mission critical"" can mean a lot of things. If this field work cannot take place, what will happen? Is it a cost and/or schedule issue? Are there other issues? We've got people on site at a power plant right now helping to solve an issue - the power plant can't restart until the issue is resolved, which is a big deal, so we consider this essential travel."
"Good points RelandsRedhead. If the trip is not essential, I think it would be unreasonably risky to approve the trip. Our County has rules that they won't enforce. There are large groups of people in the tourist areas who will not wear masks and there is little enforcement. Restaurant dining is limited to take out and outdoors. I can understand young men wanting to come to Huntington Beach. It's Surf City. But as their supervisor, I think you have a responsibility to withhold consent."
"I'd approve it. The most risky part of the trip isn't being in HB, but the flight."
"If you feel like they can be trusted to go to work, wear a mask, get their food to-go, and take it back to their hotel rooms, and not go out partying or mingling in the throngs, then yes, I'd approve it, but make them understand that they are assuming their own risk. Mask wearing has got much better, even in HB.You can also somewhat mitigate the problem by making them stay inland, not near the beach.Agree that the flight is the riskiest bit."
"As an OC resident, here are my observations. My in-law’s all got COVID. Some experienced cold and flu for a few days. Others had no symptoms. My next door neighbor tested positive. She quarantined for 2 weeks and had a head cold for a few days. She is back to work. Her social circle all tested positive. None with dire outcomes. A friend who lives in El Centro (about 4 hours to the southeast on the Mexican border) tested positive and had the worst flu ever. She didn’t get hospitalized and has returned to work. Restaurants have moved outdoors into their parking lots. To celebrate my daughter’s birthday, we had a lovely dinner at a very fine restaurant in Orange. The servers were masked. The tables were socially distanced. When I shop for groceries or buy gas or grab a coffee, masking is enforced.Traffic is back to normal in Orange County. I notice the parents of my children’s friends are utterly terrified without any empirical basis to their concerns. My kids still hang out as they used to. The real concern is the elderly and those with multiple underlying conditions. My mother-in-law has diabetes and, by the grace of God, has recovered. I don’t have any concerns about public disorder in Orange County. The local authorities enforce the law. Personally, I am hesitant to travel to parts of LA County (like downtown), although I have been there plenty. HTH"
"Again, thanks for all the input. I know that the situation is very fluid, but all of this information and the various points-of-view are indeed helpful.Stay Safe!"
"Well Hitch your one of the blessed I guess. Nearly half don't recover and are symptomatic permanently so far. They've always said this could end up like HIV where you treat the symptoms for pain and other relief.If you could see LA you'd have a better grasp on the invisible enemy. They have vaccines for the ""flu"". Big difference here."
"Can you hire a local consultant to do the in person work? It’s a liability issue if these employees get sick on the trip.Edited: 10:28 am, August 01, 2020 "
