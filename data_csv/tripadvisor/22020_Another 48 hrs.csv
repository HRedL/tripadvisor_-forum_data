Well another 48hrs planed for this weekend at least they give 4 days notice this time let’s see what happens on Friday before midnight
Gunnerroy what are the government saying the reasons behind it are ?.It seems so strange it's not as if people only meet up at the weekend.Stevie
"There is already a curfew for over 65s and under 20s all the time but as the weather is warming up it’s hope that doing this will keep people off the streets. It’s not working av seen old people stopped off police told to go home and 5 mins later there back outEdited: 1:23 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"Yeh I new about the over 65s and under 20s but it's still a huge age group that can basically still meet up bar 2 weekends.Like most people av talked to were struggling to get our heads round it.Over here I see pensioners going about but it's far safer in the house that's where my mum & dad will stay until they get the all clear.StevieEdited: 1:44 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"Doesn't make sense to do 48 hour lockdowns as the supermarkets will be packed as will butchers and bakeriesEdited: 1:46 pm, April 13, 2020 "
A suppose it makes sense especially with the higher temps coming and atleast they have gave yous plenty notice this time.What's the streets like during the day & night mate ? are the workers and public social distancing and staying away from people from other households?Stevie
"The thing is Stevie, there is no evidence that warmer weather will slow the virus down, you would normally associate cold weather for killing bugs etc.Heres hoping that things change quickly but going by the behaviour of some folk in the uk it could maybe take a while.Ian"
Our friends been out shopping today and she is saying social distancing in not happening and not all the people are wearing masks.But i guess if they have not got them they cannot wear them hullman
Naw Ian am meaning that its because there temps are going up it means naturally more people want to come outside Turks love there picnics and gatherings on the beaches even though there supposedly not allowed on them just now.Stevie
"""you would normally associate cold weather for killing bugs etc"" Bacteria tend to flourish in warmer, viruses in colder weather. Even stuff like Hep B that comes out in the summer has a gestation period of months and starts in cold weather. Now whether the same will hold for the coronavirus is anyone's guess, but the chances are better than even. Not that the virus will die out - just have greater trouble spreading in the open.As for why the weekends are now locked down for the indefinite future, it's to avoid crowds as the weather improves and people get even tetchier stuck at home. And if they just switch to weekdays, then, well, weekday curfews will come too."
"""you would normally associate cold weather for killing bugs etc"" Anyone who believes that is just in denial.The virus is thriving in Thailand, for example, and has been for many weeks. To state the obvious, it's miserably hot in Thailand (right now is the hottest part of the year, and even in the not-hottest part of the year, it's incredibly hot...).Expecting the virus to die off during hot weather is just a fantasy."

Trees they are already on a week day lockdown similar to UK it's just a complete lockdown at the weekends.Stevie
Stevie thats correct a weekday lockdown is in force and totally on weekends under 20 and over 60 are not allowed out at all one friend was fined last week for jogging.I think the main problem during the week is the distancing which it seems is difficult to get through to people and of course they love to visit family hullman
"Your right hullman where I live there is 2 family’s 1 family are on the streets more than horse crap never stay in don’t know why as there place of work is closed and the other family there daughter and husband are always hear 2 times a day at least (parents not disabled or anything ) they must of been sitting in there car at 5 to midnight on Sunday waiting for curfew to be over so they could get hear, these will be the first ones to cry if they got COVID 19 but no respect for other people lives in the building. My wife hasn’t seen her parents for a month now she FaceTimes them as knows too risky to see them"
"""Anyone who believes that is just in denial... The virus is thriving in Thailand, for example, and has been for many weeks""Gosh, you're aggressive. And the answer is: look at the data. Though Thailand welcomes millions of Chinese tourists - 11 million in 2019 https://www.thaiwebsites.com/tourism.asp - and has therefore been exposed to the virus from the beginning, the spread has been remarkably slow. It is, after all, a country with a population slightly above the UK's, but with 2,613 cases as opposed to 89,571. Even assuming undercounting - and why? - that's rather better.Edited: 2:12 am, April 14, 2020 "
"Continuing from the above, the reason why the virus should spread less in the summer is two-fold. First, sunlight is a good disinfectant, and dramatically reduces the number of surface viruses exposed to direct sunlight. Second, heat reduces the viability of both droplets and aerosols in the air. Now, it doesn't stop the spread in enclosed spaces, but you're far less likely to catch a virus walking around in the summer than in the winter.You don't hear of flu epidemics in June, do you?Whether the coronavirus will follow the same route is open to question, but, again I say that the chances are better than even. Like the flu, it should retreat. It should also come back in the autumn, but by then I suspect the world will be far better disciplined and prepared, and after this first phase of wringing hands or throwing the kitchen sink at the virus, health officials will have a better idea of what works and what doesn't.Edited: 2:27 am, April 14, 2020 "

"""You chose Thailand as an example, what about other hot countries?""It wasn't me who chose Thailand as an example. I was responding to the claim that Thailand was in the throes of a massive epidemic. If there are other hot countries where the epidemic is raging, I'd like to know, because the only ones that sort of spring to mind are the postage stamps of the Persian Gulf, and I'm not surprised, given living conditions there.Otherwise, it's quite obviously lopsided.I too, base my comments on doctors' comments. It is of course possible that the usual UK summer, even with a heatwave or two, might not be enough, so the doctors we follow and by extension we could be making two different starting assumptions. After all, in July, London apparently has average highs of 22c in the shade, an average of 6 hours of sun a day, and 14 days of rain, while in Istanbul, the numbers are 28c, 12 hours and 3 days.(PS: There was an article I think in the Lancet a short while back that also looked at humidity levels. At very high and very low levels of humidity, the virus may last longer, so it's not just the temperature.)"
Thanks jimmy / kevin / andy its difficult to keep up with you so many names.hullman

Total deaths after today will be 1510 crateegg
"I know everyone is bored,but quess the death total is pretty sickJohn"
"John I was just about to say the same thing it's a Marmaris travel forum theres no need for it any death is bad enough all these numbers are mums,dads,sons,daughter's, family members,friends,work mates ect ect.It's pretty sick IMO.Stevie"
"Excatly stevie,I unfortunately know a couple of people who have died with itJohn"
"Just FYI, a video from my favourite nurse-doctor. :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCSXNGc7pfs"
So how was Friday evening/night? Crowds again?
Plenty of people out past the midnight curfew in Marmaris and seen people this morning walking and on bikes . These must be the ones who don’t watch the news or live in caves with no communication my belief is there just thick
"Well, unless Marmaris has an exceptionally high ratio of people exempt from the curfew, all I can say is :oAppalling, really."
"All the more remarkable because the main cities are generally complying very well. Lanni and I had posted surreal videos from Istanbul last week, and here's one from Izmir, which has maybe 30x the population of Marmaris.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9lzqPWJDU4Edited: 12:45 pm, April 18, 2020 "
Yeh this morning was lots of people about but by 10am streets empty where I live seen the odd person in van or on scooter. Must of been chancing early morning to get to peoples houses before the police woke up
