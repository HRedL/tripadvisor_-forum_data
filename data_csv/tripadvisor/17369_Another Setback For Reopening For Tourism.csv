"While smaller towns take social distancing and masking seriously, it's almost business as normal in big cities.https:/…"
"I was just as appalled yesterday when visiting my local supermarket here in Burlington... the place was packed with people doing their shopping, young and old alike, and probably only 10% of the people in the store were wearing masks... myself included. Even the boys stocking the shelves weren't wearing masks... and with everyone invading everyone else's space too. Totally insane! I couldn't wait to get the heck out of there.Just like Cuba, it seems that some are getting very lackadaisical now with believing they have nothing to worry about. But as that article points out, it only takes one person to completely upend all of the hard work that's already been accomplished. Thanks for posting that article, candysita. As I've said before, God help us all.Terry"
"Today is shopping day for me, I have been doing our shopping once a week since this pandemic began, I find the wearing of masks has increased and generally people are respectable of your space but there are exceptions every week, some people just don't get it or don't care! I couldn't read the OP as my Spanish is limited, until everyone takes this thing seriously this will not be getting under control and travel will not be an option!"

"Just came from the dentist, you can't go in without a mask on. The dental assistant had her full gear on.....told her, I don't even know who you are. The dentist just had his usual mask and gloves..but he always wore that..so nothing different there. no one else is there when you are...you're spaced apart. After that went and got groceries, they only let so many in, most had masks on....you walk with the arrows...but most don't do that, me included, if no one is there....you make a run for the item you want...lol"
"gator, although I was wearing a mask, I had to shooo away perhaps 6 people who weren't wearing masks from invading my space when doing my grocery run. I did that tactfully, but the weird thing was that in each instance, the person didn't apologize or even acknowledge that I had said anything to them at all. They said nothing. They were like a bunch of zombies. If they want to risk their own health, that's up to them of course... but not when their actions put my health at risk too. It was absolutely bizarre. I asked a very old lady who was shopping there why she wasn't wearing a mask... she said she was keeping her distance from everyone. But I'm a lot more spry than she is, and I found that I was constantly on the move quickly backing up as people with no masks were almost climbing over me at times. I was afraid for her safety... I even complained to the store manager and he just gave me lip service with little concern for what was going on. Terrible!gator, be careful out there when you go.Terry"
"Lori, you must have gone to Longo's... they know what they're doing there to help keep everyone safe, including giving out free masks (great marketing). That's not where I went yesterday... I went to the same grocs store that I've been going to for 35 years... but I told the store manager, this time is my last.Terry"

'exact control of the epidemic'. Well i guess it will be quite awhile before tourism opens in Cuba. ps - some say the virus is getting weaker. Maybe it will do a Spanish flu.
@6... I yet have to see arrows and mask distribution in Toronto (including Longos). Most people on the streets do not wear masks.
"I was in a Walmart a few weeks back, on a Wednesday afternoon in the neighborhood where i grew up, closer to downtown. I really can't say that i have been surrounded, sorry to say, by so many dumb people. It seemed 80% of the people didn't realize there was a problem/virus or they just didn't care. I won't be going back in there for a while. I did phone the province. The store was letting in way too many people and really not following the rules. Crazy store and it always kinda was. ps - all the other stores i frequent, bueno!"
"Our Longos in Mississauga has arrows, markers, etc...and you must wear a mask.Id report any grocery store Etc.....that doesn’t follow social distancing or control shoppersEdited: 12:20 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"No, didn't go to Longos...don't think we have one here? Went to Sobey's. Kind of in and out all day, just went to Walmart, this one has no fresh produce or meat..so wasn't very busy, not many wearing masks...I do wear one. Also went to the pet store..said only 10 customers in at a time..no one at the door...although it wasn't very busy...I guess you're supposed to guess how many are in there...didn't get that one."
"@10 Orbit, walking out on the streets is a different matter... one can see someone walking towards them and then simply hold your breath when passing by and giving a wide birth. But when you're in packed grocery store and people with no masks are sneaking up behind you when you're bent over looking and concentrating on whether you're buying the top sirloin or the t-bones, that's when things get freaky and whacked out for me.On a lighter note, the wife of my best friend who lives upstairs (also my renters) played a dirty trick on me the last time I was at grocery store a few weeks ago... she came up behind me unannounced hacking her guts out and then fell into the oranges face down so I couldn't see who she was. I backed away horrified like I was doing the moon-walk... and then she slowly turned her head towards me and curled her hair behind her ear exposing her big cheeky evil grin on her face. I just said... you bugger!!!No worries about the oranges... she's virus free!! ;-)TerryEdited: 12:50 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"To the original poster Candysita2, the article you quoted does not seem to have a date. It also does not added up as there is only 8-12 cases a day and Cuba presently only have 197 active cases. Where are the hundred reported in the article.I know you are just sharing it but as of June 4th the border is still closed. Maintenance workers are allowed into Varadero but hotel staff are being told July 15th. Initially they spoke about mid June. Hope it opens soon. m"
"Hola @14""simply hold your breath when passing by and giving a wide birth""How is that going to work for you on a plane full of people for 3 plus hours, for me not so much. I do not care how good the ventilation is going to be upgraded on the plane, it is all about the distance....On a different note, it was just weird getting a haircut yesterday. Cheers"
"rrricher, no doubt masks will be mandatory on flights... for everyone! My best friend who works for Sunwing (and presently laid-off of course) told me that Sunwing is now hiring back the executives who are responsible for cutting the deals with hotel operators in the Caribbean for all-inclusive packages. That's good news. Let the new planning commence!Terry"
"Fryday! Yup, haircut, went for one the other day :) Bueno! Mask mask sanitizer. Bueno. When i first seen my Barberessa, i asked her if she prefers Teriyaki or Barbecue sauce with her human meat. She was wearing one of those larger black masks. When i was paying, i left her a $20 coronavirus tip and told her, hopefully one day she will save up enough money to get her teeth fixed so she won't have to wear the mask anymore. She did lol. But when i was leaving, i was thinkin, i couldn't remember if maybe her teeth needed some work. I will apologize the next time i see her. And i guess that is what it would be like to go visit Cuba in the near future. Mask mask santizer."
"Re 15 - the article says hundreds of suspected cases. Today’s report has 195 active cases and 527 suspected. If you read the thread which bellagio started, Gengen haves more details.Re the original article - elsewhere it is reported that Cuba will restrict the first tourists to the cayos, so an outbreak in Havana is not really relevant."
"I stand corrected, thanks for the relevant post Beardocubauk."
"No problem. And that report that I mentioned says that they won’t open Varadero until later.https:/…Edited: 3:15 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Reply 21 link. One has to plan. It is said to be a 'leak'. I wish them, Cuba all the best. Is there, i wonder, a leaked document about what happens if a tourist/tourists employee/employees are virused while at the resort?"
They sometimes use leaks as a way to test opinion.
New Broken News! on CBC! It was leaked. One of the Canadian airline companies is pondering about maybe sending a plane full of ferrets to Cuba to spend a week at one of the first opened Cuban resorts to see what the out come will be. lo siento.
#15 Terry.... and how did you know she was virus free??? That's the problem... no-one knows who has or hasn't got the virus until tested & the test only says you don't have it at the time of the test. Remember the virus can transmit 4 or 5 days before symptoms appear..... so someone coughing & spluttering all over the produce in a supermarket as a joke is 200% irresponsible !!!!
