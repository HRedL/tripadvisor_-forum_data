You are in one of the safest countries. If you are worried probably best to stay there.
"Seriously, you are asking about the situation with Covid-19 two months in the future???"
"Never stopped people from asking about bush fire situation two months in advance. A bit of Deja vu? My gut feeling is that it has not hit its peak yet and seriously, if India becomes a hot spot, it will make China looks like a Sunday picnic."
A bit of Deja vu? You said it!
"Well short of all flights to Australia being cancelled, I’m going there in May.Seriously OP how do you expect to get an accurate answer. Do,you think the forum members are clairvoyant or have some special information on the virus that isn’t in the public do,abin?Edited: 7:08 am, March 01, 2020 "
I'm not sure if they've schedule an outbreak in May yet. Keep watching the news to see though.
"Well I plan to go if the US lets me get on a plane and Australia lets me in at the end of April. Our travel insurance will not cover travel bans. I am out over $9000 (international and domestic airfares and non refundable hotels and the cost of the useless travel insurance) I just want to go on the trip if we aren't sick or injured. First case in my city, no ties to the virus so yeah, couldn't even buy toilet paper at the store yesterday."
