"Pier 1, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in February, has been done in by the coronavirus closings, wants to reopen its remaining 541 stores but only to sell off merchandise and then close permanently:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pier-1-im…https:/…"
That is a lot of stores. I feel for the people who are going to be out of work in these Covid-19 times.
"The stores near Bayside and Rego Park in Queens have already closed. It was a fun place to look around, but at my age, there was little I wanted to buy. NYC formerly had Azuma that carried imports and the late Stern's on 42nd St. had a popular ""bazaar"" with similar things before they closed in the '70s."
"When I was a 70's teen, we went there for our groovy stuff like rattan and incense. It got more upmarket as the years went by but I could always find a bargain or two..."
">> When I was a 70's teen, we went there for our groovy stuff like rattan and incense.LOL. It was the best place to get baskets for every purpose. Macramé flower pot holders, anyone?"
"Cost Plus World Market is the place to go for inexpensive groovy stuff these days. Unfortunately we don't have the full stores in NY because they also do a big business in wine and our liquor licensing requires a separate store front . But if you're ever near one pop in for a look, some India print bedspreads and plonk"
"Pier 1 used to have lots of cool stuff, then it went all upmarket :("
