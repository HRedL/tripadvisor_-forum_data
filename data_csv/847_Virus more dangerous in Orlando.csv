"Do you feel Orlando is more dangerous than any other cities in US?Orlando/Disney is most popular place in US.""Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days.""You might NOT feel sick while in Orlando but when you get home, that is when you start to feel it. While you might have this virus, you could have spread while being incubated."
"Disney is closed, as are most other attractions. So danger probably the same as NYC. Regardless of some random city being more dangerous than another - why worry about it- just stay home."
Staying home is the best!
"What a strange thing to ask.The theme parks have been closed for a while now in case you were not aware! So, Orlando is no more dangerous than any other city/town."
"As everywhere is closed, when are you looking to go??"
"Not just the theme parks. Most shopping is closed, restaurants can only offer take-out food, bars are closed, so are movie theaters. On the coasts, the beaches are mostly closed."
"Your question has two parts:1. Is Orlando statistically more dangerous now than elsewhere?2. Will Orlando be more dangerous when the theme parks open?Q1. Two sources are the frequency of infection now (i) in Florida compared to other states; and (II) in Orange County, FL (Orlando) compared to other Florida counties.I. Florida is among the top 6 states currently in Corona virus diagnosed infection:https:/…index.html 2. Orange County, FL currently, in a small amount in a small sample (by County):Orange 11 (9 Florida residents, 1 not in Florida, 1 non-Florida resident)Volusia 9 (all Florida residents)Osceola 8 (6 Florida residents, 2 non-residents)Seminole 7 (all Florida residents) Lake County 2 (all Florida residents)Brevard County 2 (all Florida residents)Polk County 2 (all Florida residents)Sumter County 1 (Florida resident)https:/…Q2. The answer may depend on the approach to public health standards on crowds and proximity risks of pandemic transmission.A. An approach can be the one taken by the Governor recently not to close beaches during Spring Break.B. One approach can include medical evaluation of those risks in the future.C. One approach can be public confidence in the safety of families on re-opening."
"Actually, Orlando could be less dangerous. Covid-19 *could* be like other coronavirus and do better in cool/dry climates. Orlando, has had temps in 80's - 90 for a while now.The point about Florida being in the top 6 states is misleading. Florida is the third most populous state in the county, so of course it has more cases than states like Connecticut or Rhode Island.Currently, Florida isn't even in the top 25, as a percent of population (they are number 29). The top 10 states, from that statistic are: New York, Washington, Louisiana, District of Columbia, New Jersey, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Connecticut."
I don’t think the virus being temperature sensitive is true the Southern Hemisphere is in Summer now and has many cases.
"I could be wrong but if you have virus and live in warm climate, you might not see the symptoms but you are carrying and spreading virus without knowing.If you live in cold climate, you visit places such as Orlando and go back home after visiting, then you might be able to overcome and recover while someone you spread to has lower immunization which will cause them more harm."
"One measure of the magnetism of the Orlando area is: it has 7 of the top 10 US theme parks and 4 of the top 4 US water parks, with total attendance averaging in excess of 250,000 persons per day. https:/…Theme-Index-2018-5-1.pdfThe responsibility of proper public health resolution of crowd and proximity pandemic risk before the reopening of Orlando theme/water parks—attested by pre-eminent medical authority such as Dr. Fauci and others—cannot be overstated.This bears not only on the health of then-current visitors and persons in their home communities with whom they will have contact--but the very credibility of the theme parks, water parks, and the Orlando, FL area itself."
">>I don’t think the virus being temperature sensitive is true the Southern Hemisphere is in Summer now and has many cases.<Every virus is temperature sensitive and most all have a seasonality; it's just a question as to what degree. The seasonality not only has to do with how certain viruses respond to heat and humidity, but the fact that with warmer temperatures, people spend less time packed close together inside where viruses can more easily spread. Those factors don't prevent/stop the virus, merely lessens the transmission rate. Yes, warm climates are still experiencing this virus, however some preliminary data indicates, it not have the same rate curve as cooler locations. Jury is still out, though."
"It's noteworthy that Australia is having hot summer weather and the coronavirus is spreading.Statistics on numbers of cases of coronavirus around the US have a lot to do with the amount of testing. There was a lot in Washington state, not much here in Florida. We are now at a point where tests have become more available and that means an increase in the number of reported cases; hospitalizations are also increasing. But protective equipment for people taking test samples is at a premium, so the current advice is for people who have mild illnesses and aren't elderly to not get tested, but stay at home. The disease is spreading very fast at present, so next week's and probably next month's figures on hospitalizations will probably be vastly worse. It'll be a while until we can make reasonable predictions about anywhere in the US being more or less safe.Edited: 5:18 pm, March 21, 2020 "
I can guarantee you here in Australia where it has been a very hot summer we have the virus and it is spreading rapidly.Weather plays no part in this.
Stay home Disney will always be there go another time.

"We are all being asking to stay home, esp. NYC."
Florida hospitals etc. will be stretched very thin. Older population and virus hits senior living buildings (including nursing homes etc.) very hard. Many snow birds are still down there and will have to stay and ride this out. Unfortunately many still came for spring break and will certainly add to the state's numbers.
"I don't think the virus is more dangerous, it is the fact that people don't want to miss going on their vacations or to theme parks that makes it dangerous. I have been to the parks and have seen people with colds, casts and other things that they probably would stay home from work or school but when you have booked a long desired day with the mouse you somehow soldier on. Theme park goers the ultimate germ war fare carriers."
"This might be just the beginning.If my instinct is correct, you might see extended closure for Disney and other amusement parks."
"If I am correct, the OP is a troll."
Surffish.I think you are right!
Did I see the news that they extended the closure?Maybe you two are trolls.
New York is the most dangerous place now by far.
You are sesquipedalian person. Truth will reveal when time comes.
"This is just the beginning.There will be more extended closure.If my instinct is correct, the virus will revive itself until cure is found."
It is sad to see Disney and other parks to be closed.We hope that all this problems gets resolved and get back to how it was before.

Worried more about Florida since all the snowbirds and visitors are there. I would prefer to be in Florida if possible.Watch out if China blocks borders and stops foreigners from entering. They could be trying to hide something. Perhaps virus are revived and numbers are increasing again.
Kays NY state has over 50000 cases while FL has 4000. But you are more concerned about Florida? I am sure both numbers are under estimates. We all need to stay put.
"The epidemic in Florida lags behind New York's. It isn't expected to get as large. The models at this site are changing almost daily as new information becomes available. The predictions are approximate, but provide some guidance. https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections"
David that’s a very interesting site. Updated daily with new data. You can pick state by state. Looks like Florida won’t peak til May 3. If that’s true there is no way the pros or the advice to stay home will open in June. Worth a look to see the curves
Oops meant if peak is May 3 as projected there is no way the parks or advice to stay at home will be lifted in June
"This Miami Herald story, which should be free access, lays out the dismal situation about potential deaths in Florida. It seems likely that Florida will suffer more deaths than California. https:/…article241637691.html"
"Orlando should be closed until vaccine or cure is found. As weather gets warmer, there will be less symptoms and commercials would like to reopen for business.Why it is more dangerous in popular tourist destination is, people will spread more Virus during the summer than winter since more people will be out. Specially during summer break, if Orlando opens doors, it will cause big problem when fall/winter comes this year.This is a mess and of course no one knows for sure of the future but it is good be cautious."
">>It seems likely that Florida will suffer more deaths than California<<Why doesn't that surprise this Californian. Our Governor shut down CA on 3/19. Bay Area mayors preemptively set Stay At Home order 3 days BEFORE that. Yes I am ending my 3rd week shut up at home. And if you want to look at data, check San Francisco's numbers. In a city of 800,000+ we have 529 positives with only EIGHT deaths. (As of this morning.) Most of CA's cases are in the southland. But as FL did not take early steps, I fully expect their numbers to blow through California's, just as Louisiana and Michigan are doing. All on much smaller populations. (California is the most populous state in the nation with 39M people.)"

"Florida DID take early steps. Just because you are unaware of it or did not hear it from the moron on TV, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.BEFORE the statewide stay at home order, the restaurants were limited to take out only, many municipalities already had stay at home orders (we are one of them), and most non essential things were basically closed anyway.As far as things spreading again, I do not disagree with that. However, my understanding of all of this hardship was to slow the spread and obtain the staffing, supplies, directives, etc. in the event that things did get bad again. You can't shut down the economy for 18 months until you find a cure. I probably need to stop blabbing before I get myself in trouble."
"Mike,I'm very lucky to be working. I complain about the hours, but I'm still damn lucky. I'm also grateful that I have a yard and our stay at home order isn't as oppressive as others.It is kind of a mix between being damn lucky and frustrated with the loss of freedoms and seeing the health and economic disaster of others.If one ever had a lesson to teach their kids, it is now.

"The same types of people tried a boat party too causing a closure of marinas that might otherwise offer people a safe way to get outdoors and distance. You can't restrict everybody for a few stupid people. They took a risk, and unfortunately, some of paid dearly. I take a risk by driving to work every day.I actually live in Florida, and I got a pretty good idea of what was trying to be done based on what I was allowed to do. At first, we had very limited cases. It remember sitting at a bar having a beer while waiting for a to go pizza. That Sunday, I was on the beach and later eating a sit down meal in a restaurant in the port. As communities realized there was a bigger problem, they started closing the beaches, we had a 6"" restriction at the restaurants, the theme parks all closed (it took a hurricane to do that in the past), just about every other activity closed. Since that didn't work, we had stay at home orders and restaurant closures. Everything was measured in a way to balance freedoms with a crisis based on the best available data and lack of leadership at the federal level.I fault the Governor for the religious exemption in the stay at home order, but not much else. I am grateful that I live in a country and in a state that does try to preserve freedoms before initiating draconian orders. I am grateful that I was able to spend part of Easter driving over to watch Manatee in a park without having to register my vehicle on a phone app for the government. I am grateful to not live in a closet around 12 million other miserable individuals in a smog-filled city. I know that I am a minority. I am an registered, right leaning, independent voter that is a Trump hater. How is that for a minority?When you don't have federal leadership or leaders that can't utter a complete or consistent thought, you do the best you can at the state and local level.I am also well aware of at risk groups. I haven't been able to visit family as they have wisely chosen to mostly stay at home. My wife has had to make deliveries to close friends by dropping stuff outside the door and not visiting in person.It is wonderful to be on a computer telling everybody how they could have done better from another location. Hopefully, we all learn a little something for next time.I think I am officially tired of ranting and going too far on the political side. I hope all out there get through this, and hopefully we all get back to work."

Unfortunately we may have left things later than we should have in the U.K. as well .
"Many Florida counties were much more proactive than the State. Which led to the odd pictures of packed beaches next to empty ones. The State certainly could have acted sooner and in a pandemic situation every day matters. I do understand that it is easier to make such calls in hindsight, but there it is clear that greater foresight was exercised by some localities."
"The obvious answer to this question is that Orlando and other Florida vacation cities only became dangerous when people from other places like NYC fled to Florida. And, if you look at where foreign visitors come have come from in the highest numbers, NYC is probably number 1. And then they head to Florida for better weather."

One view is visitors, who are expected to pay big money to come to Central Florida, do not come to to be treated with a standard like this. Blaming others is neither persuasive not good business.

If Orlando re opens, not sure if Orlando/Florida is ready.Be careful of getting corona virus tested in public location, there are many people who is catching Corona virus when going to hospital where they do the testing. They test negative but catch it during test and start to feel the symptom after few days of testing."
"Re: Post 55786kays notes:""Truth is Corona Virus second wave is coming like it or not. If Orlando re opens, not sure if Orlando/Florida is ready."" Readiness can include antibody testing (not a vaccine, cure or treatment)-- to see who has HAD the disease, and who produced antibodies in response to it. That testing can help deal with current and second wave contagion 786kays notes.However, in a recent study of over 100 patients--who were believed to have HAD and recovered from the COVID-19 virus--those patients then tested positive for the virus again,The President has cut off funding for WHO which is investigating this development, and other projects. https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-be…For those concerned with readiness and re-opening of the parks:1. The uncertainty surrounding antibodies and the overall situation before a vaccine (such as inability of temperature to test for asymptomatic disease) may delay assessment, readiness and reopening. 2. Florida should have a public written strategic plan for readiness in advance of a vaccine which Dr. Fauci has said may take ""one year to 18 months, at least"". Issues could then be addressed in advance and readiness for park re-opening accelerated. 3. Further on the thread: although statewide spread is an issue, Orange County recently reported more than 1,000 additional cases in one day. Whether this is the result of increased testing, new cases, or a mixture: the issue for public safety and confidence necessary for successful reopening, in view of the second wave noted in Post 55, remains. .Edited: 10:14 am, April 15, 2020 "

"I read what 786kays wrote on the substance.I understood his concern to be:1. The way tests are administered can impact not only current measurement of current individuals and thus current community status—but can itself alter the incidence of disease.2. The prospect of a second wave is real. (This factor 786 identifies takes on added seriousness as the Governor presses to re-open business in advance of adequate testing and what considerable medical authority otherwise view as prudent.)3. As every day progresses, the issue becomes more and more whether Florida is positioning itself, and working strategically with others, to reopen theme parks before a vaccine. That’s serious, in my opinion.I view the lodging arrangements of 786 as his business.

Trump has just announced phases to open back up statesOnce these phases are met Florida will open simple as.Whether that entices people to go there will be up to themselves but atleast there is a clear plan in America.
“Clear plan in America “That’s sarcasm right David? There is no clear plan. They don’t have a plan they have a PowerPoint.
Question is. will the US allow travel into their country from UK or anywhere else for that matter before June at the earliest.
"No sarcasm just an opinion I have. It’s simple for me 3 phases you can’t move phases unless criteria is met, atleast people know to some degree what the plan is.It’s better than what we have here. We’re in “lockdown” for another 2 Weeks atleast and I have no idea when they’ll be lifted or eased whatsoever. But hey look it’s just an opinion."
"Thanks David. My concern is we don’t have the appropriate testing right now. They like to brag we have more testing than whatever country when we have 5-20 x the population. Per capita testing is not appropriate and without that it doesn’t matter how many phases the supposed plan is, we can’t meet the minimum testing criteria so any part of the plan after that is fantasy."
"Uh no. Trump can't make that decision. That is up to the Governor of Florida and the individual cities, counties, and businesses. Don't expect to see much in the tourist corridor in the Orlando area open for another couple of months or longer. Mayors Dyer, Demings, Attkisson, and Alverez are not going to rush into this--we haven't even seen the curve start to flatten yet in this area.

I see where you’re coming from Octoberitaly tbh I get it :) Marion you started after us we announced another 3 weeks last week. Rumours here are we’ll be extending it so we’ll have to see but yeah we’re in the same boat.
I don't think Disney and other parks should have reopened. I can see Disney and other parks shutting down again.This second wave will give a bigger blow than the first.
"The current ""first wave"" is booming. The IMFE University of Washington model is a bit optimistic that infections might be peaking, but suggests that very widespread use of masks is needed to cut infection and death rates. Our state and local governments seem reluctant to require that. Perhaps Walmart, Publix, and other retailers will set effective examples. https:/…floridaI used Orlando International Airport last week. It's not exactly a ghost town, but it's scarcely busy. The new C parking deck is closed. The A deck had vast empty spaces. For all of that, my checked bag took an hour to show up.In a political environment where Florida officials are reluctant to do anything much to reduce the spread of infections, my best guess is that Disney and Universal may remain open with rules that make casual visits nearly impossible, so that visitors are largely people with relationships to Disney--season pass and others. Disney's new ticket plus reservation system might prove permanent. I think that for most Orlando residents who can limit their contacts, the risk of coronavirus infection is fairly low, but thanks to the recent huge rise in infections, it's now far higher than it was back in March and April.Edited: 8:08 pm, July 17, 2020 "
Not really sure I understand either of your sarcasm but thank goodness my hospital built more ICU as we are using them. Still in the first wave and numbers of infected and hospitalized and deaths are all higher than they ever have been. Staff out sick makes staffing an issue. This sucks.
"Today's statistics were dismal, as has been usual. I wouldn't encourage anyone to visit, though I'm tempted to see how Epcot is looking. It seems there's rumors that the big Festival Center, the new centerpiece that was the cause of so much demolition, will be scaled back or maybe not built for a while. At the beaches, it's turtle nesting season and I'm headed out to look for the comet."
"New York University's Doctor Radio interviewed the #2 official at the Dept. of Health and Human Services, a non political position, and he's somewhat optimistic about opening schools and continuing with fairly normal life. University of Washington modeling hints that international travel might possibly open up by the end of the year. Meanwhile, it's not very prudent for older people like me to travel domestically. It does seem that a lot of the present burst of covid-19 cases has to do with a burst of visits to indoor bars around Memorial Day. It appears that closing bars, limiting indoor restaurants, and limiting social contact can be nearly as effective as locking down the whole economy. (ADM Brett P. Giroir, M.D.) The vaccines are looking encouraging.Unfortunately, the avalanche of new infections in Florida right now need not have happened. It's a national disaster as well as a local disaster. Giroir thinks things are looking better. We'll see."
"October, it’s easy for people who don’t work in the medical field ( I know you work in the medical field) to make comments about how this isn’t as serious as ‘everyone’ said it was, and how speculation about a second wave isn’t being taken seriously. I can only imagine it must be like a living hell seeing so many patients die every day, some of them young, and even if they aren’t young, they are someone’s grandparents and parents.It’s easy to see how people who haven’t had to deal with that level of heartbreak every day for weeks on end can be dismissive about the potential of a second waveI dread to think , as a retired nurse, the physical and psychological effects of seeing hundreds of patients being admitted to hospital every day where you are in Texas, and many dying every day, on you and your colleagues.We all have to hope that things get better soon where you are, they are better here in the U.K. but by no means do I have any faith in this government to do the right thing, they have failed miserably so far.I too hope there isn’t a second wave here in the U.K., I’m enjoying seeing my granddaughter again, been shopping a few times, had my hair done and been out for a meal. Heck I’ve got a Florida trip booked for next October! But until we all realise a second wave is not an impossibility, I don’t think people making sarcastic remarks is very helpful.Keep your chin up October, hope things get better in Texas soon."
"As I said I wasn’t being sarcastic & I don’t recall posting dismissive comments about Covid.. Just pointing out that all we’re getting is doom & gloom, very little positive..I do however think businesses needs to start moving forward.. If they don’t & more people lose jobs holidays will be the least of their worries..There are folk out there taking the pee out of the furlough situation & that’s no good to anyone.. Where’s the money going to come from??I'm sure there’s plenty of jobs that can be done relatively safely which aren’t.. I’m also sure if the furlough wasn’t as generous for this length of time plenty of folk would be back at work by now..Reading October’s posts (& others in the medical profession) I fully appreciate the work & worries they face daily, but we simply can’t lock down the planet until this passes or we get a vaccine (which plenty will refuse to take).."
"Mike I totally agree with some of what you are saying, especially the furlough situation. It’s coming to an end soon and rightly so. However, we do need to be mindful of the fact that some people are acting like it’s all over and we can go back to the way we were. And it doesn’t help because Boris says we can be back to normal by Christmas, sending completely the wrong signal. I feel he is saying this level of transmission and deaths are acceptable as the ONS have stated that numbers have stopped falling for a few weeks.Thankfully we didnt get too much of an increase in cases/ deaths after the crowded beaches and protests,though we still have a considerable infection and death rate most days. Probably because outside transmission is low.I know the figures are unreliable but it’s all we’ve got to go onI totally agree we need to get the economy going, we are unaffected as we are retired, but our daughter in law has lost her job. But we need to get the clear message across that there is still a dangerous virus in circulation, which given an opportunity will begin to infect the population again at a rate that is difficult to control"
"Oh and I don’t listen to the press either, there has been two Select Comittee broadcasts on the BBC parliament channel this past week, they are the people whose information I take notice of."
"""""However, we do need to be mindful of the fact that some people are acting like it’s all over""""Absolutely Coaster.."""" our daughter in law has lost her job.""""Sorry to hear that, its my ""main"" fear.. Not for myself or DW as we have our own businesses & we're busy, but I've two 16 year old's heading to 6th form (along with thousands of others) what are their prospects going to be in a couple of years if we carry on giving money out with businesses folding??"
Thanks Coaster and Mike for thoughtful discussion. Anyone else just want a redo on 2020?
Yes October let’s go back to New Year’s Eve 2019 and start again! And kick COVID ‘s butt into space!
Oh....the noise.
"Oh the noise. Here's some more.As a former epidemiologist, an (very inferior) underling of Tony Fauci at NIH way back in the whole Aids crisis, there is no noise, no panic. BUT maybe there should be. Mainly due to the surge of those who dont want to help others and refuse to wear masks. I wasnt alarmed until memorial day and the reopening of places that shouldnt have been (under the CDC guidelines at the time). 2 weeks later and the spikes in infection began.It isnt a hoax. It isnt a conspiracy. Left or right. It isnt rocket science.Have fun, live life. In the open air over inside if possible. Wearing a mask and social distancing until there is a vaccine (and you can be bothered to get vaccinated)."
"I'm beginning to think US-Europe flights might resume around November or December if the double-whammy flu/covid wave doesn't materialize. There is some legitimate sign of the US coronavirus epidemic calming down. Then again, Florida isn't making much effort and may be spreading the disease to the rest of the country."
"I think there is no doubt that Florida is exporting this all over the US. Cases in Key West are up over 500 percent since we reopened June 1. Many of the cases are workers in the service industry. Every one of them likely interacted with hundreds of tourists in close quarters before they had symptoms, not to mention all the asymptomatic people not being testing.Waiters, hotel front desk staff, tour operators and bartenders all work closely with guests, and many guests seem mostly unconcerned about what’s going on. A concierge I know says every day people pull their mask down when talking to him. Some ask him to remove his mask so they can hear him better.It’s a shame to imagine the ongoing damage to the economy and unnecessary deaths this is causing, but as one tourist told me yesterday, they just HAD to get away, as if staying home for a few months in the comfort of their home with cable, internet, and plenty to eat and drink was the biggest sacrifice in history."
"I'm advised not to travel (age, other factors) and did an incautious trip a week ago. Fortunately the destination was low-contact. The rush to develop and distribute vaccines is unprecedented. Never before have vaccines been manufactured before they passed all the tests. Inevitably, huge batches will have to be discarded. Disney and Universal, by shutting down, persuaded Florida to do likewise. Now the major retailers, by demanding mask wearing (finally; individual stores have been doing so for a long time) may have set the standard. When Walmart, Home Depot, and Costco agree on something, I think most of the public will pay attention."
"I hope all these will not lead to ""Novus Ordo Seclorum""."
Annuit Cœptis!Florida news remains dismal. Governor is getting more flexible about reopening schools.
