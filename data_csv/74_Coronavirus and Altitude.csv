Interesting story about low infection rates above 3000 meters. This seems true from the stories out of Nepal as well.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_ame…
Only a tiny population lives in high altitude in Nepal
"The effect is only noticeable at above 3000m altitude, really not many people live that high in Nepal, or anywhere, like Pierre W already notes. Most Nepalese or at least a large portion of them actually live only few hundred meters from the sea level, as surprising as it sounds.Edited: 9:39 am, June 01, 2020 "
"In Peru or Bolivia yes, large populations at high altitudes."
"True, the only sizeable cities at over 3000m are in South America, and Tibet. The speculations about acclimatisation affecting Covid-19 are based on statistics from these areas, not Nepal."
"Very low numbers from Ladakh as well. Lots of possible factors involved , including different kinds of populations - I saw a comment on the original article mentioning that obesity is four times more frequent in Lima vs Cusco. Higher levels of UV radiation might affect how long the virus survives outside the body. Lower population density in general in high altitude regions ( two persons per square kilometer in Ladakh) . Dont know how acclimatization would be involved in this , but in the ICU I work in we have been cautios in taking COVID patients too high in oxygen saturation. A bit more people living high in SA , Kham , Amdo , Yunnan etc than commonly assumed. Most seem to be unaware of that El Alto is both higher ( 4100 + ) and has more residents than La Paz.Edited: 9:20 am, June 04, 2020 "
"As it relates to Nepal and India, this is a bit of a non-issue. The majority of cases in both India and Nepal are closely related to migrant workers returning from New Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkuta. The majority of those returnees are not from areas above the hill regions, at elevations similar to Baglung, Gorka, Rukum, and maybe Mugu. The low infection rates in higher districts has nothing to due with altitude."
Of course Im not at all qualified to speculate wehether these things have anything to do with each other.I do however think that the availability of medical care in Nepal does strongly correlate with altitude. Negatively. And that is probably also the case for the availability and use of tests.
"@7 Some of this speculation borders on misinformation, and it's causing some problems in Nepal. There were initially assertions that the virus would not impact strong, young Nepalis. More than 10% of cases have been kids, two of them accounting for some of the first deaths. It's also worth pointing out, 85% of the current cases are men between the ages of 20-45. This is largely influenced by the fact most cases are pulled from migrant workers returning from India. These are people going home to the Terai and lower hill regions.It's also worth noting, of the 15 polymerse chain reaction testing machines, all are in the Terai with the exception of the units in Pokhara, Kathmandu, and Surket. Testing done beyond the Terai, in the low hills, is minimal and samples have to be tranported to a testing lab, which currently has a 6 day backlog.So, we will not likely know what the virus is doing in the mid-hill regions and certainly not above them. But again, there is very little in-bound traffic of people going to the higher elevations. There are simply not many communities in those higher reaches.This is why the vast majority of cases are along the border districts. Has nothing at all to do with altitude."
COVID-19 Breakthrough with Mountain Sickness Drug @ https:/…
"The article you linked to starts with ""Dexamethasone, the steroid commonly used to prevent acute mountain sickness (AMS),"" which is a completely false statement.Hopefully Dex is not commonly used, and never for prevention but only as a one off pick-me-up in acute situations of HACE where you need to descend someone."
"In prolonged use Dexamethasone causes mental problems. In one well published case an American ""climber"" going to Everest carried Dexa and asked his family doctor when he should take it. ""When you start feeling like it"" was the answer. So he felt the altitude in Tengpoche and started taking it. At the BC two weeks later he started to behave strangely, had lost his marbles, permanently. So he sued the doctor, like American like to do, and this was settled out of court for undisclosed amount of $$$$$$$.What I am worried about is that some imbecile now starts taking Dexa profylactically against Covid-19.Actually the news is not much of a surprise: lung problems both, HAPE and bad Covid-19 infection. Dexa helps some 20% of the patients, no more. It is no miracle cure."
"""What I am worried about is that some imbecile now starts taking Dexa profylactically against Covid-19.""Of course quite a few imbeciles will do! And Dex is dirt cheap to buy in any pharmacy in KTM so you can be sure that plenty will get it.Didn't know that Dexamethasone was also used in HAPE treatment."
"@12, For many medics it's more commonly used for HAPE than HACE. But, does it really matter? Prime Minister Oli has confirmed Nepali are not under threat of COVID because they eat a lot of turmeric, garlic, and ginger. And also ""breathe clean air."" Maybe he hasn't been to KTM. LOL"
