Despite many questions asked here about the subject there have been NO cases of the coronavirus in Punta Cana. There have been a couple in other areas of the DR and they did not flying through or stay in Punta Cana. Enjoy your vacation and don't let fear keep you from enjoying life.
"good to know, but your information is unfounded"
"https:/…Santo Domingo.- Despite that several countries have closed their borders and restricted the arrival of people from China, Italy and other nations as a preventive measure against COVID-19, the Dominican Republic still allows the entry of passengers arriving from those countries through several airlines.This is confirmed by a statement from JetBlue airline, in which its customers are informed that all those who have been in China in the last 14 days will only be able to travel to Punta Cana (PUJ) and Santo Domingo (SDQ), and no another destination in the Dominican Republic.So far the Dominican Republic has restricted flights from Italy, however there are passengers who have entered the country, with connections to other terminals such as Spain.JetBlue has told its customers of the measures they have taken against the new coronavirus and of the restrictions that exist in the destinations in their itineraries.I'm thinking NO to vacation ....Edited: 5:40 pm, March 12, 2020 "
So I guess the 7 that have it in Bayahibe didn't breath or cough on anyone? Bayahibe is 43 miles away. Get real.@hdbjones...Thanks for the link. It is what I expected. China has a great deal of investment in the DR.I don't believe the DR will share info re victims in PC.

Cover your eyes Deb. ; )
You are correct. Of course people can't be expected to stop traveling but we are definitely spreading it.
"Exactly Darlene. If I were scheduled to go now, and I went, I feel I would be irresponsible. A county a mile away, that I frequent often, is basically on lockdown. I am not saying anyone else would be, just how I would feel.Glad I don't go in October. I hope its gone by then."
"I’m just stunned with the number of posts and replies from those with the attitude of “screw it, nothing can stop my good time.” We have a responsibility as a society and world community to try to slow the spread of this thing (flatten the curve) and altering the way we live and conduct ourselves will make the difference. Those who are healthy will probably be fine. Those who aren’t-we know it will hit them hard and some won’t survive. The DR is still developing and the healthcare system will not be able to take care of their population. The population of a country that many claim to love will suffer. Our vacations can wait, but for some, this will end in devastation."
