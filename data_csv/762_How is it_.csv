How’s the travel been? How are the restaurants handling breakfast and dinner buffets? Are all amenities available etc? Worth the risk of traveling? Want to go again for our anniversary in September. Give me some trip reports. Thanks
It’s a Covid19 free paradise!!
Have you been recently? Which hotel? Are the services at the hotel all available?
We postponed a few months out - so we are not there now as we should be so perhaps not the best response but when we asked the St Regis this question they sent a sheet to us outlining the changes and what was available/not. As of a few weeks ago - they said there would be no buffet style breakfasts or meals. Spa services reduced but definitely available. Masks inside and in “close” proximity circumstances etc. Even little things like they won’t place flowers around your neck on arrival but you will be offered to do so yourself. They will spray your luggage but will still handle it for you etc. It was very detailed. Perhaps email wherever you’re looking to stay and they may have a similar list available!
Im here in BB. No buffet we have to order from waitress. Restaurants are a mixed bag. Bloody Marys was busy last night. You wear a mask but can remove at table. Our hotel restaurant is dead maybe 3 to 4 other couples. Its my first time here so I cannot compare it to normal times. But its better than the states as you can go out and relax and enjoy a meal. I say go. Unless you are unhealthy and compromised if you catch the virus.
What hotel?
Matira is beautiful and practically deserted!
@Tra T - It is unfortunately no longer Covid free - Please insure you follow safe distancing and wear masks in crowded or public places.
We are here in Bora Bora now. Spent 3 nights at the St. Regis in a 2 bedroom overwater bungalow with pool. Pure heaven. They said they were not even 1/2 full but we thought it was perfect! There were about 11 tables full at Lagoon last night for dinner. There are definitely some Americans and French who are not wearing masks or social distancing but we are!!. I feel bad for the FP’S as they are all wearing masks while working.

"""Where did you end up getting ur PCR Covid 19 test done? I’m in Sacramento and I can’t seem to find anyone who will get results in 72 hours""Same question. Be interesting to hear her response."
"Hi there- how often did you have to wear a mask? Do you have to wear it around the pool, walking into the resort, to and from the restaurants? I have all included breakfast. Is it now a la carte?Thanks,Rita"
"Clint and Satinder - So sorry, just seeing your questions now. We got our tests at Stanford's Drive by testing site in Palo Alto."
