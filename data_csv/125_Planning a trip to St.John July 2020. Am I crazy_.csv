"Hi guys, After a LONG winter in Chicago (including quarantine) I can't wait to take a few days off and enjoy a beach. I've been following the news and I read USVI is welcoming tourists again so I'm planning to visit St. John in Mid-July. Obviously I do have concerns because of the pandemic but the desire to enjoy a nice beach is overcoming my fears. May I ask a couple of questions? 1. Are you guys planning any trip to St.John in 2020. Do you have any concerns? 2. Any risk of disruptions on the ferry between Saint Thomas and Saint John?"
I don't think you are crazy. I'd go in a heartbeat! We have an Exumas s trip planned for July that I am really hoping is not cancled.
"Hoping to be there in 2 weeks, zero concerns other than the islands staying safe and able to manage new cases as they are bound to see some new ones. We are pretty much distanced on vacation, so won’t be any major adjustments. Happy to abide by rules if it lets us travel."
"We are hoping to be there July 16th thru 26th. Praying our flights on Delta do not change. We need this trip so bad right now, we have both been working so much and staying home in lock down for 2 month so far. What a blessing it will be if we are able to come to the Island where we feel the most peace, during this crazy time in our world. Hope you make it and have an amazing time!"
We also bought our tickets last November and will be ther from July 22-29 with a party of 7
I hope you aren't crazy because my husband and I are hoping to be there the 3rd week of July. Looking forward to getting away from it all.
My wife and I are planning on being there July 4-11 and July 25-Aug 1.
"We will be there for a late June / early July trip that we booked last September. Have to admit that I have some anxiety about the trip and if I did not have one booked I would probably opt for something else.For the record, my anxiety is more about instability with the flights and risk that something is going to get screwed up there at the last minute."
Many of us who live here are also anxious.
we are going mid june for 7 nights. nothing cancelled yet. Isn't July hurricane season?Nik
"hurricane season is now until Nov 30, but peak is Aug/Sept"
Keeping with the positive momentum on the thread and YESSS not crazy. Be on island 7-7 to 7-17. Just use common sense and we will be all safe.
We are fully booked for July with multiple inquiries coming in still - you’re not alone. Many people are VERY excited to get back to the island.
I can say that the residents of the USVI are very concerned about how the opening of tourism now in this increased visitation timetable will be reflected in a few weeks in any increases of Covid-19 infection cases here.There seems to be a rather cavalier attitude in many stateside places and the cases of infection is rising quickly in some of them. That does not bode well for us here where we have all been very careful up to today.
"The attitude seems to be, since the country us opening up, that somehow the risk has somehow diminished? Next we wait and see how the riots will affect the caseload in our cities. Having made a trip to the ER on STT in the middle of the night during one vacation, that is not an experience I would take a known chance on repeating personally. No disrespect intended, but the medicine I needed was not available on the island, after waiting 7 hours to be seen. It was not good. I rescheduled till 2021."
Those who travel must remember that the medical infrastructure on STJ/STT is nothing like that here on mainland. We will see if cases increase over next few weeks. We are supposed to travel late July into August and still not sure we will. I’m 68 and my biggest concern is flying. Between canceled flights and health risk of sitting on a plane for hours just not sure what we will do. But hope all those who do go are careful.
We r booked for July 5th.
"3rd week of June for me! My flights are booked and will close on villa today or tomorrow. I admit to some apprehension, but more so about the airports and flights. If United were flying non-stops in June, I'd feel much better about flying. In June only connecting flights on American were available. I thought about waiting until July because, but the deciding factor for June was I'm more comfortable traveling sooner after the opening than later. Protocols will stay fresher in everyone's mind, mine too (I already see much ""protocol fatigue"" in my city less than a week after opening). Plus, it's an unfortunate given that new cases will rise when the islands open. Situations might change quickly with entry restrictions or requirements. I'm more comfortable traveling last minute right now, and sooner rather than later. If my villa were available sooner than the 3rd week of June, I'd have tried to come sooner too. On STJ, thinking possibly a few take-outs, maybe a private sailing excursion which should be a low risk activity, but mainly distancing and very limited interface. I get how concerned residents much be about the opening & will try to always be mindful and respectful of that during the week."
"Will there be enough space, with social distancing, for the restaurants in Cruz Bay to serve everyone wanting meals and drinks? What will it be like standing in line to pickup sandwiches for a beach lunch? 1 taxi from STT to Red Hook per family only? Will prices of pretty much everything go up? I would guess ""island Time"" is going to slow down substantially and there may be a lot more waiting. Still, I'd be more than happy to spend 9 nights down there!"
Taxis are 50% capacity and wear a mask.
We are going to be there in a week and are probably going to get a private taxi. We were hoping the Crown Bay Ferry would be running but their website now says they are resuming service to Cruz Bay on 6/15.
"My family and I booked a trip the last week of July, so no you are not crazy! In my opinion it is important for tourism to come back to boost the local economy and support those small businesses that make the island what it is. Doing so in a responsible manner by respecting others andcontinuing to practice social distancing when needed. My family is so excited for this trip and it can’t come soon enough."
"As a teacher, this is my only chance to travel. At first we tried to be content with stateside travel, but with most things only partically open and now the protests, we have bought tickets to SJ for the second week in July. This will be our third trip to St John and although we are 60 we dread telling our college age kids. They're not gonna be happy with us taking this risk. We are waiting to tell them when it's closer. The thought of having to wait a whole year with nothing to look forward to this summer was a bleak feeling. We both have a twinkle in our eyes now.Edited: 4:22 pm, June 04, 2020 "
Speaking of cruise ships it appears they resume in July:https:/…
"After checking Royal Caribbean and Disney’s websites, both say they aren’t resuming cruises until at least the end of July."
"KikaP, the schedules were in such a mess with all the cancellations that VINow hasn't updated any as yet - that's the old scheduling (they're established at least a year in advance). Everything is still wildly up in the air with proposed resumption dates ever-changing. We won't be seeing any cruise ships until at least August.https:/…39187"
"We are coming in July for 9 days we have rebooked 3 times now , hope you can make it there .. stay healthy so the trip will be safe for islanders and you !!"
"My husband and I will be in STJ from July 24 to August 2, and to say that we are excited would be an understatement!! However, out of respect for the people who live in the USVI, we will be maintaining pretty strict social distancing for the two weeks prior to our trip (not that we aren't doing that anyway, but want to minimize the chance that we bring the virus with us as much as possible). It's good to keep in mind that just because we are on vacation, we still have to do the things that reduce transmission: wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds, wear a mask when in businesses and around other people, maintain social distancing etc. Hope you and yours have a wonderful trip!!!"
"@STTResident, makes sense. I've seen the June canceled there and though that the schedule might be actual. I guess it's pretty devastating for the economy when a few thousand people per week can't come and spend money. I'll do my best starting Monday, but we, mere individuals, can't match the f̶i̶r̶e̶ spending power of the USS Caribbean Princess b̶a̶t̶t̶l̶e̶ cruise ship :-)"
"We are heading to St. John August 11th-26th. We are hoping for a relaxing time, social distancing, maybe a bit of snorkelling. Bigger concern is the flight from Cincy-St. Thomas. Having no non stop flight on Delta, we have to layover in Atlanta."
We just booked a trip August 19 thru August 26. So NO you are not crazy.
"We can relate to the anxiety the locals are feeling. We are in a similar situation in Las Vegas. We rely on tourism, conventions, large gatherings for our economy. Our unemployment rate for April was almost 30% which made us the highest in the country. The Strip reopened last weekend and the tourists showed up in droves! I work at McCarran Airport and it literally went from a ghost town to a circus overnight. While it is exciting to see our city and our economy roar back to life, there is also much trepidation about what it could possibly bring with it. I understand both sides of the argument. We are rebooked from May to August 15-23. So excited to return but we also plan on being much more low key this trip. More take out, cooking at the villa, and enjoying the more secluded beaches!"
More and more people in town this week. Lots of villas occupied while going on my walk this evening. Up to you how you want to handle your vacation but any of the open air places I don’t worry about going in even with the influx of tourists.
We too are going to St. John next month. The quarantine has been hard on us too. We need this getaway desperately. We have rented a small home via VRBO. We are are healthy and practice social distancing at home and will do the same on vacation.
We are here now very nice no cruise ships beaches are empty come on down
My husband and I are here now...we've been here for four days. It is wonderful and everyone is very inviting and happy to have tourist again. It is just like in the states...wear your mask in public places and they may ask you to put on hand sanitizer before touching items in gift stores. The ferry schedule has changed a little but basically as it was before. It runs I believe every other hour up until 8pm ...please check because it may change ( this is Red Hook to Cruz Bay). I hope you have a wonderful trip!
"For the residents who live there now and the people visiting, how's the restaurants? Are there plenty open? I'm a little worried ONLY because we will be a family of 6. I'm not sure how difficult it will be to get a table to eat out or should we just go ahead and plan on picking up and eating at the villa?"
Make Reservations and you should be fine. Lots of places are open
"Just returned home from a great week in St John. Red Hook ferry is open with some minor schedule adjustments. Crown Bay ferry is just reopening. Beaches are wide open and most establishments have plenty of space to distance and enjoy. Be prepared to wear masks indoors, but the policies are reasonable and not that burdensome. Safari taxis are perfect and ramping back up."
"Sounds like the consensus is that you are NOT crazy... at least that's what the crazies (me included) say to each other LOL. I booked flights to St. Thomas back in early April for 7/23 to 7/29... my husband thought I was insane, then flights started getting cancelled, which stressed me out. I didn't want to cancel my flight and just hoped and prayed that July flights will remain and so far... 2 months later they're still happening. My husband now cannot wait to go and I'm no longer alone in being crazy to book a flight in the middle of a pandemic. We're hoping to get a little boat to go around the islands for a day or half day; maybe find a family to split the cost if possible. I think it's good to get out and do things safely and carefully, be aware of our surrounding, respectful of everyone around us and we should all be fine. Cannot wait!!!"
We just came back from the Smokey Mountain NP and had not problems. Follow the restrictions to wear masks and keep 6 feet apart. There are so many bays and tails on STJ there is plenty of room. The order out food or just make your own meals in the rental. Enjoy
"Have been wondering- for those of you traveling now or planning to travel, what is your contingency plan if you or someone in your party begins to have CV19 symptoms when you are on St. John? I am not trying to be snarky or start a row, truly want to know because I have been kicking this around and can't come up with a scenario I am comfortable with. One obviously couldn't fly home, possibly for quite some time. Even if you don't require hospitalization you may not be able to stay in your villa indefinitely...would you move somewhere else while ill? Would love to plan a trip right now but am uncomfortable with the circumstances and certainly would hate being a burden..."
I don't think you are crazy because I did too!!!I just came back from St Cloix. There are some require that you need to check temperature at the St Thomas airport. And ferry still on going but not regular schedule. Maybe 1 or 2 a day and someday were off at the moment. I don't know about st Thomas and st John. Transportation I use in St Thomas was nothing back up or any problem. The beaches I walked from st Thomas airport was beautiful. Many restaurants already open but not fully. I think you still can have great time.
Visitors should be aware that since reopening on June 1st we now have contact transmission on St John - two cases in the last few days.
I booked a trip to St john for early August. Just have to use caution with travels
"NorthStar - to answer your question about how to handle someone in our party who gets sick: I am dealing with it like most of my problems by ignoring it :)But seriously, I've given this a lot of thought. Someone has a fever the day before, or gets sick while on island. It's really difficult. Do I cancel my family trip that we planned for a year because of one person? Probably. And the $20K or so that we spent on the villa would be non-refundable I'm sure.If someone got sick on island, I'd probably stay with them, find a place, and ride it out for 14 days. Work remotely I guess.I don't know. It is a very difficult problem."
CarolinaI’d wait on you planning a trip until you without hesitancy feel safe to visit St John.
Also should be noted that no tourist has come to the island and then tested positive for coronavirus since the beginning of this pandemic. Zero.
Do we even know if/how many visitors have been tested? Is the VI testing anybody who wants to get tested or only people with symptoms? I haven't seen any clarity on that issue.
"@Tour - Good point about the tourists. But, rather than classify everyone into 2 groups of tourists and locals (and that definition is pretty broad), I think the tenor of the discussion should be about travelers or not. If you're a traveler it matters not if you are a ""local"" or a tourist. You are a potential vector to bring any disease onto the islands. As long as travel is allowed into the territory there is opportunity for new vectors.Here's hoping everyone is doing their part in terms of distancing and masking. We're all in it together and will experience the consequences good or bad. For our trip next week, we'll be distancing and especially avoiding groups as much as possible and masking anytime we need to interact with others. We'll be pretty isolated to ourselves out on the East End. We always stay to ourselves on the beach and avoid any that are crowded. No plans for any inside dining and definitely no bar visits."
We're flying out Friday for St. Thomas for a week. I've been following the USVI COVID site religiously. There will be a new statement out by the governor tomorrow.Tim
"KeepLeft- am actually not particularly concerned about acquiring CV19 while on St. John; the question is what to do if you start having symptoms while there. (For most of us air travel is probably the weak link- spending time in security lines, terminals and possibly crowded flights may be unavoidable.) Would you be happy to allow visitors to quarantine at your properties if necessary?TSJ- what makes you think tourists who come down with mild symptoms will seek testing? They and their traveling companions might be leery of a forced quarantine or the possibility of missing flights home until they test negative."
"If any traveler arrives at the airport with a suspect body temperature, they'll immediately be tested further."
"PB: i year ya, there was a big concern expressed about what to do if you came down with Covid while here on vacation and I was just making the point that it has never happened so I don’t think it would be my main worry. Anyone with symptoms can call DHS and get tested as a traveler. As a resident with symptoms they will tell you to quarantine unless you have had direct contact with a confirmed coronavirus case."
"Have heard that NSAIDs can mask Covid symptoms such as fever. Not saying people would intentionally try to get through screening that way but who knows. Most people don't get terribly ill and if, like unpainted said, you may not be able to recoup significant costs for your trip if you cancel they might be tempted to try. Or maybe you are on island, feel icky and just want to get home..."
"We are coming in August. We were to be visiting STT on a cruise, which was cancelled. I have an Airbnb booked and we plan to just social distance there and the beach. I’m praying the island stays open to visitors and no flight cancellations. I NEED a vacation!"
"Just curious from Post #52 -- ""I've been following the USVI COVID site religiously. There will be a new statement out by the governor tomorrow.""I looked but didn't find specifics --- will the statement be live and what time?"
Text COVID19USVI to 888-777 and you’ll be subscribed to text updates regarding COVID-19 cases in the USVI.
"We just came back a week ago. We wouldn't have gone had our villa owner allowed us to reschedule, but it is what it is. We took as many precautions as possible and always wore our masks at the airport and during flight, in the cab and on the ferry, if we needed to go out to the store, a restaurant, etc. We did limit our time and trips to town greatly this year, going at ""off"" hours to limit the amount of people we were around. We cooked a lot more at the villa, provisioned with Landlubber Logistics to reduce our inevitable trips to the grocery store and didn't go to the shops near as much. We hiked a lot more, spent a couple of extra ""villa gravity days"" than usual, etc. We always wore masks and noticed most others in shops/restaurants doing the same (walking around town was a different matter, people weren't as consistent there nor one of the restaurants we visited). We tried being as responsible and mindful as possible during our trip."
"Brandiebb, no trip report:("
"@ Snorkeler -6 I know! I need to do one before I forget the details. That's not very level 6 of me. Ha ha.. I always plan on doing one and then I think, well it's not 54b-worthy so it's not worth sharing. ;) Thank you for the reminder!Edited: 1:35 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"I know....I am nowhere near 54b worthy as I am pretty much matter of fact, but I still love to read any trip report."
"Yes, please do a trip report. Would love to read another one!"
"Heading to Coral Bay on Sunday. Fingers crossed and trip report ready. This will be our 2nd time to St. John. First time we loved Hansen Bay and Maho early in the day. We did 6 beaches, but want to definitely venture out to some new spots. Ideas or suggestions."
