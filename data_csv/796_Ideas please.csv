"I would like to visit lake Garda, amalfi coast, Florence and sorrento. I’ve been told I can do Pompei etc from sorrento. I’m looking at 2 weeks next August/ sept for 30th wedding anniversary. Does anyone have suggestions please or a suitable itinerary where we get some chill out time at the end. Thanks"

Thankyou and yes we are looking at August 2021 depending on circumstances with the virus etc.
"I suggest flying into Milan, railing into Florence from the Lake Garda area, railing from Florence to Sorrento. For your return home, return from Naples or Rome. No backtracking."
