"The tourist arrived two weeks ago. On July 25 he was admitted to a private clinic and diagnosed with Covid 19. He died only a few days later, yesterday July 28. In today's Por Esto translated:https://translate.google.com/translate…"
Here's some more info that also includes the name of his resort: The JW Marriott.https://translate.google.com/translate…
sad and scarry :(
"Outta the 3603 cases reported Benito Juarez, 683 deaths is a 1/5th death rate. Yikes!Edited: 12:48 pm, July 29, 2020 "
I would be curious if that small hospital is equipped properly to handle Covid cases. Also would be surprised if they even admitted him with no one to guarantee the charges.
"It definitely isn't somewhere I'd go to be treated for something serious. But I do know they treat a lot of tourists if they can present a credit card upon adnittance. That's likely why they took him there. They charge the card initially and keep charging it as days go by. Chances are the person has enough of an available limit on his card to get him through the door.Quite frankly, it's more known for being a birthing center than a place to treat a serious injury."
"Joan your advice is always nice to read. While I may not agree in certain respects you are respectful, & give really solid advice. So I’ve been searching out anyone who has been placed in quarantine while staying in Cancun, I have yet to find anyone. The most recent article about the Brit is the closest I’ve found about a foreigner potentially spreading Covid. Reason I ask is we travel in a few weeks to CUN, & what if a foreigner doesn’t have a card or enough of a limit on the card? If an AI for example takes a temp, it’s high, then does the AI force you to the hospital for a test or does the AI just refuse that person from entering wherever they were...ie dinner? Thank you ma’am!"
"JimBobXD,I can only tell you what I've been told. If upon check in the resort determines someone to have a fever, obviously, they will not be permitted to check in. What each resort does beyond that is dependent on their individual plans. Different resorts deal with it differently. Some transfer you to the hospital for testing. Others take you to a clinic they may have an arrangement with. Naturally, that arrangement doesn't include being responsible for payment. Honestly, I'm not sure how each facility would handle that. Cancun hospitals are notorious for demanding payment up front. I have been told that the government has made arrangements with one specific hospital to take tourists who can't pay up front or can't pay enough up front. Then payment arrangements are made once admitted. To me that means contacting the patient's family to have money sent for payment. But that's nothing more than a guess on my part.I don't know which hospital though. As for a person having a temperature once checked in that's found when they try to go to dinnrr, I believe it's, once again, dependent on the resort. Different plans for different resorts. My guess would be they'd retest you 15 minutes or so later. If you were still feverish they might ask you to return to your room and a doctor would be called. After examination I would think it was up to the doctor to determine if you needed further examination in a hospital and if you should be tested. At that point, I don't think you have any choice in the matter. But again, that's just what I think the procedure might be. I've not heard of any tourist being placed in quarentine. This death is the first thing I've heard with the exception of there's tons of stories out there on Facebook by people who tested positive upon arrival home or shortly thereafter. I do know this to be true in some cases as a friend works as a waitress in a very popular resort here and stays in touch with many repeat visitors. She tells me just in the past week a group told her they tested positive a few days after getting home and before that there was a group of 20 where the majority tested positive. And thank you for the comment on my being respectful. It's not important if people agree with me or not (the world would be so boring if everyone agreed, right?) but it is important to me that my posts be taken as respectful. It really is the least we can do for each other whether we agree with a post or not. So muchas gracias,!!!"
"IInteresting question, Jim. I dont know the answer but if anyone here knows, it will be Joan. I have had limited experience with hospitals here but they do not admit me without a deposit, albeit a small one. But I hear that is because I am a resident and can be a huge fee for tourists. As Joan mentioned, I also heard the clinic was primarily a birthing center which surprises me more that they would accept a Covit patient.Only ammending to add that I was posting at the same time as Joan! I knew she would come through.Edited: 5:57 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"I wonder what happened to the group of 20? If scoured FB too, may I ask what group you are in so I may research a bit more? I’m only in a Cancun one that has 0 info. Thank you again!"
"The group of 20 didn't test positive until they returned home. The resort they stayed at did not require masks once you were in the door and there were no temperature checks before entering the restaurants or bars. Social distancing wasn't a big thing there either. So unless they were told the resort they weren't feeling well the resort had no way to know. My friend says they told her some of them started feeling bad about 34 through their 2 week trip but kept it to themselves so they didn't miss out on the party. Once home, they sought medical intervention."
"Sorry, I forgot to answer about the Facebook groups. I'm not in any. I have friends who are and they tell me about the posts. But personally, I rely on what friends working in the resorts tell me. They are much more reliable than any Facebook group in my opinion."
"Ah ok I wonder how they didn’t get caught by the temperature checks? Makes you wonder if they are really temp testing people. When we go ohhhhh no everyone stay away no party for us, we will drink our beverages & listen to our music with a 6 ft pole by our side. Lol Really appreciate all the info!"
I do not have FB. Were these tourists at all inclusives?
"Ciara, The group of 20 I was talking about were staying at an all inclusive where my friend works. It's out there on several sites so I don't think there's any issue with telling you the name of the resort. They were staying at Temptation Resort and Spa. But I'm quite confident in saying people from other resorts have tested positive as well."
"Yikes.l! From what I have read about Temptation, it seems like a pretty hand on resort if you know what I mean. Still sad. I feel like Cancun is taking such great precautions. I’m headed to the Valentin in September still holding out hope."
"""Outta the 3603 cases reported Benito Juarez, 683 deaths is a 1/5th death rate. Yikes!""That is not how that works. You need to know the actual number of people infected which is surely much higher than 3603."
"When I stayed at the Hard Rock, next door to the JW, they were extremely lax about enforcing rules amongst guest. The staff themselves were always wearing masks and gloves and always cleaning. But hundreds of people inside the lobby at night and during the day, at the restaurants with no masks and very close to each other. What surprised me more than anything was how many older people were on vacation in a foreign country that honestly lacks the medical care of the countries from which they came from. Given I was there too, but im 40 and my GF is 26. I run 10 miles a day and cycle another 30. Im in very good shape. If I were past 50 over not in good shape, I wouldn't risk it. The majority of the males at the HR pool were overweight which makes them high risk. Add to that just about every older person there was also overweight, I was very surprised they would risk it.The Intercontinental Presidente was super strict and very sanitary. Either way I came home and was tested and got my negative results yesterday. Back to work tomorrow!!Another thing about Hospitals in Mexico. Some private Hospitals are very good, they are JAHCO or TJC approved like US Hospitals But their capacity is much smaller than any hospital in the US. Another thing with the payment at private hospitals, if you don't have money you dont get treated, plain and simple.I strongly suggest getting travel insurance EVERYTIME you go on vacation. Call to see what coverage you have as well. Most now will not cover COVID, but mine does. I checked. With most travel insurance you only pay deductible of a few hundred dollars and the rest is taken care of by the travel insurance or your medical insurance later. I should know, I had a medical emergency in Puerto Vallarta that resulted in $100,000 cost for medical and evac. I paid $100 only. DONT rely on just having you medical insurance pay for it. They will (hopefully) only pay MONTHS later and you will still be responsible for the cost upfront. And no evac cost covered. Dont risk it to save what cost starting at $100 to $400 for travel insurance."
"Unfortunately even if they did, doesn't necessarily guarantee that they were not positive for Covid. I have known several people that have tested positive with other systems or none at all and never had a fever. Temperature checks can sometimes be a false sense of safety."
COMP who did you buy travel insurance with? As you found all I’ve found exclude Rona.
"As I understand it the tourist was "" of English origin"". But did he travel from the UK?I ask that because as far as I am aware Mexico is on the list of currently being unsafe to take a vacation and I would have thought that it would have been difficult to get a flight to Cancun from the UKDid he fly from some other place?"
"I just googled UK to CUN & flights came up, guess that means folks from UK can go?"
I don’t think there is any DIRECT flights from the UK at the moment.
"I posted a link to a travel policy a week or so ago that definitely covers Covid. And I’ve also seen one with world nomads. There are several policies out there. Now they do not cover if you decide today “I’m scared to travel because of Covid” but if you get there and you get sick they cover. Mine even has emergency medical evacuating to get me home should the airline not want to put me on the plane. It’s with travel guardThat said, having had experience with travel insurance I would recommend you not go unless you can afford to put several thousand dollars down upfront for a hospital anywhere in the world. Americans are used to the rule that if you show up in our emergency department we have to take care of you regardless of your ability to pay. That is not true in other parts of the world. And they are not going to take your word for your travel insurance or your documents. you’re going to have to give them some money upfront and then work with the travel insurance to get them to pay your cost. Actually I won’t go anywhere without this after having a unique experience with the great British healthcare system If we hadn’t had health insurance the outcome would have been life changing. But since we had health insurance a private hospital took my friend and dealt with her problem.I am on several Facebook groups for the resort I am considering for my next vacation. So far I have not seen any reports of Covid among returning guest. That said I will be social distancing from all the people who think “I’m on vacation and I don’t have to wear a mask.” So if you’re in line behind me in the bar and you get to close expect me to turn around and ask you to back off. I will turn and walk away or go a different direction when I see a big group of you blocking my access without wearing mask. I don’t want what you’re giving away. And I also think it’s incredibly rude for us to assume that the staff should wear a mask to take care of us but we have no responsibility to do anything in return. It’s rude and arrogant and we need to change that behaviorEdited: 7:48 am, July 30, 2020 "
CAROL yes yes yes us too in regards to keeping our distance while at the resort. I’ve seen where it’s a reimbursement type setup for travel insurance so I’ll head your advice & checkout Travel Guard. We leave 11Aug so I think I have to get my be ASAP for wife / I.
"I’m pretty sure if you’re in the United Kingdom you can go to Mexico, now when you come home you’re going to be subject to that two week quarantine. I don’t think they have locked their citizens in the country. Getting there however can be a challenge from what I’ve read."
"This is what Travel Guard saysFOR POLICIES PURCHASED AFTER MARCH 11, 2020On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. Therefore, any losses for trip cancellation, trip interruption and/or trip delay caused by or resulting from quarantine due to COVID-19 is not considered “Unforeseen” and will not be covered under the terms and conditions of this insurance policy.However, this does not affect any Medical Benefits available under the insurance policy. If you contract COVID-19 prior to departure, you would be covered for Trip Cancellation, if you have a confirmed and documented diagnosis and/or you are medically unable to travel at the time of departure due to COVID-19. If you contract COVID-19 while on a covered trip, you would be covered for Medical Expense and Trip Interruption/Curtailment benefits if you have a confirmed and documented diagnosis."
"Just bought it, you are spot on I’m a licensed health broker, & called them just now. I kind of knew what to ask about exclusions in general & it goes hand in hand with what Carol said. $89 for two people total....now I’m only interested in the medical coverage. It’s a reimbursement policy as normal but still $20k each is good by me, we have enough to float us while in MX till insurance kicks in. We are staying 9 days total....thx Carol!!!Edited: 9:33 am, July 30, 2020 "
"Ashtonian: Excellent point. I don’t think England has been allowing travel outside their country for a while now. So, I wonder where this person came from? It is sad either way but I am curious if that person came from some hotspot!"
"If the majority of tourists in Cancun at the moment are from the U.S. (the country with the highest rate of infections) then that pretty much makes Cancun a ""hotspot""...... As a potential traveler to Cancun, the indisputable point for me is that there are Covid positive people spreading this around resorts, restaurants, and transportation, infecting others. It's really terrible."
"English as in a Brit, not American died sir."
No one else will let the Americans in so Mexico it is. No thanks for me.
"Mexico is all about the money. That is the only reason that they are still allowing (and encouraging!) tourism. You couldn't pay me to go to Cancun or the Riviera Maya right now. Many people seem to see it as a safer option than staying at home and perhaps it is a safer option right now if you are coming from many places in the US. You cannot trust the Mexican health data and even if you do, the limited testing makes the numbers difficult to interpret. Things are going to get much worse in Mexico before they get better."
"#31, so true.Marcus, correct, Families Still travel, takeing their children to Beach locations, before school returns, Including the Mexican Nationals ! Along with the High Heat/humidity Now In Mexico ,not the time to Go , but People will take the Risk,even with their children !!"
I think you have to look at the deaths and assume a reasonable mortality rate to try and back into the real rate of infection compared to other areas. Granted the mortality rate is likely a bit higher in Mexico than say the US or Canada but it is also not likely 4-5 times as high either. When I look at Playa Del Carmen for example they have 989 cases report 570 of those have recovered and have had 89 covid deaths that is almost a 9% mortality rate for Cancun its even higher. Is it really close to 9% likely no its more likely they have more cases they don't know about due to testing shortfalls. I think the real right might be close to 3% though. This means to me that while they report 330 active cases based on the 9% mortality rate that I think should be closer to 3% I am going to triple that number and estimate there are more like 990 active cases in the Playa Del Carmen area. This still is not a high rate per se well under 1% and roughly about 0.38% infected active cases. Based on this I am still planning to go next month.
"There's a lot of assuming and surmising in your comments. Fact is, we don't know the real death toll in the area."
"Post #36 is ignoring the reality that many people who have come down with COVID-19 are experiencing significant long-term negative impacts on their health. No one knows how long these impacts will last (could be forever). Death is not the most significant end-point for most people. Hopefully people travelling Mexico from areas where COVID-19 is a major problem will either self-quarantine for 14 days before they leave or get tested within a few days of leaving. Testing of temperature has been shown to be a very poor indicator if someone has COVID-19. A recent study in a leading medical journal showed that most new cases of COVID-19 are being caused by carriers who have no symptoms. This is why spending extended time in an airplane is such a bad idea right now.Edited: 9:54 pm, July 30, 2020 "
Well if we are talking most people Marcus most people who get it have had minimal impacts and many didn't even know they had it as well. It is a minority of the people who are seriously impacted and need hospitalization. These are primarily older people particularly those with underlying health conditions. That said there are also a number of younger people who have had it also and sometimes required hospitalization and other times gotten very high fevers. In terms of long term effects those really are not known at this time given how new the virus is.
"With COVID-19 you need to recognize that it is so contagious that a very large percentage of the population will get it if appropriate preventive measures are not taken. This will mean that ""rare events"" like death will still have a major impact on the population with respect to overall numbers. And yes, the long-term health impacts are still not fully known. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that these can be significant. Yet another reason to not be travelling to Mexico at this time. You don't want to bring the virus with you, you don't want to get sick while you are there nor do you wish to bring it home."
Its contagious yes but those risk are largely mitigated by wearing a mask falling to 3% if you come in contact with someone has covid19. It can move even higher with a face shield. I have been working from home for 4.5 months and have not been going out other than to curbside pickup groceries and the drive thru lane so I know I am not bringing it with me unless it came in from the air conditioning. I will have both a mask and face shield with me when I go to Mexico next month. Of course I do not want to get it while I am there which is why I will be taking precautions and take them today in my everyday life.

"Well, wearing a mask protects others more than it does you. However, if everyone who wants to travel to Mexico conducts themselves the way that you have been, the risk isn't that great to either the person travelling or to where he/she is travelling to. I have been carefully managing my risk as well but I would not be comfortable to flying to Mexico in a flight with lots of people from Texas, Florida, California, etc. That is a personal perception though and in general flying has not been shown to be that risky (unless the plane is full, including the middle seats...).Have a good trip!"
"I dont recognize the answer but if every body here knows, it will likely be Joan.

"Post 48, I agree. 454tarmac, we traveled on the 14th August and got tested prior to leaving. The critics will say that doesn't matter and stay home because you could get infected the next day which is true.
