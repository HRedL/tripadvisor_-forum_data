"Does anyone know where you can get a PCR test any where from Albany NY to Buffalo NY with results coming back within the Aruba 72 hour time frame. I have called everywhere in the Syracuse area and right now the results are taking about 3-10 days for a PCR test. We are traveling to Aruba September 2., so we will need to be tested on Sunday August 30.Thanks"
"We also live in Upstate NY (Albany) leaving on 9/4. We are driving to Secacus, NJ. Look at Riverview Medical Center. Many people here have used them . Nothing in Albany."
"Thank you for your quick response. I will call there tomorrow. It is about 4 hours away from us, but would definitely be worth the time if we could receive a PCR test and have results back in time."
"Middletown Medical in Middletown, NY was doing rapid Covid tests results in one day. That was almost one month ago, a Telehealth phone call was required with MD prior to test. Then appointment would be made for test. If you’re coming from Albany that’s only 1 1/2 - 2 hours from you. Just double check they are PCR."

"Thank you. I will give them a call. I live in Syracuse, but we are willing to travel to be tested if we can have our results in the time frame Aruba has put into place."
Thank you. WellNow Urgent care in the Syracuse area is stating results anywhere from 3-10 days. It could change in the next few weeks once most of the college students are back on campus. Many colleges and universities are requiring students to submit a negative PCR test before returning to campus.
"We are considering a 4 hour drive to get a guaranteed test result in the time frame that Aruba is requiring. We are renting one week from a time share owner that is non-refundable now that the island is open for tourism. Our second week at the Hilton is refundable. I would rather drive 4 hours now than be quarantined upon arrival or even worse have a positive PCR test upon arrival and be stuck for 14 days or longer from my spouse. We are going to test 14 days ahead of travel to make sure we are negative with a PCR test and antibody test , then another PCR test 72 hours before then have an Antigen Test two days before departure. We will self quarantine after first Covid PCR test to limit exposure. If we don't have the results back in time we will test upon arrival. We are hoping to spend our 30th Wedding Anniversary in Aruba on September 8."
https:/…find-test-site-near-youPut your address in the box and see what comes up. It's worth a try.
"Thanks. I have used that site and have called almost all of them. Most are saying 3-10 business days for results. Hopefully the testing results times will be less in a few weeks, I have been told that with surgeries and students going back to school, the number of people being tested is very high and the labs can't keep up. The outbreaks in other states also affects NY testing is what I have been told."
https:/…testingTry Walgreens. Right now they have 4 Walgreens that do rapid PCR testing. One in Tonawanda and one in Webster.
Is Walgreens an acceptable testing site. They do the RT-PCR which was on the list of accepted types on Arubas travel website. But Walgreens does the testing on site as opposed to being sent to a lab which is why they can get the results so quickly. Anyone have any feedback or experience clearing in Aruba with them. .

"We had appointments scheduled with Walgreens in Webster NY for this Sunday and back up testing at Middletown Medical in Middletown NY on Monday Aug. 31, we received an email today from Walgreens cancelling our tests for unforeseen circumstances and Middletown called to tell us that they have run out of Rapid PCR tests. We are now trying to figure out what to do. Our flight leaves from Boston on September 2 at 6:00AM. We will most likely try an Urgent Care facility here in Syracuse and hope for the best, as well as receive an antigen test where we will get results in 15 minutes, so we can board knowing we are negative. We will test in Aruba if results don't come back in time. We did test two weeks ago at WellNow Urgent Care and were negative and received results in about 50 hrs."
"I have called many of the Walgreens on the Rapid Test Site and almost everyone that I called has stated that they send tests out to a lab, and results anywhere from 2-5 days . I also called KSW Diagnostics, they have multiple locations in the Buffalo area, their current results are coming back around 72 hrs.. All of the AFC Urgent Cares in Ma are booked for the next several days. I am hoping for a miracle so we don't have to test in Aruba."
"Hi Michelle, I’m confused if you had the Covid test done at WellCare why don’t you just go back there? My son just had his test done at WellCare in Albany , got his results back within 2 days. My test at Middletown is scheduled 9/1, they have not cancelled mine. Concerned now. I might have to go to WellCare Monday as a back up . We leave 9/3. Good luck"
I scheduled the other locations because they had told me I would receive my results in less than 48 hours. I wanted to make sure we didn't have to test in Aruba. We are going to the WellNow Urgent Care in Cicero again and hopefully have the results as quickly as before. We 'will still have an antigen test to be sure just in case our results are not back in time. Hopefully you do not receive a call from Middletown Medical with your test being cancelled. Good luck!
