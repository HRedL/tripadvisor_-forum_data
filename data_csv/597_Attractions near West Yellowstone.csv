"In addition to Yellowstone NP, what are good attractions near West Yellowstone?"
"What are your interests? I prefer time inside the park, but for others it is just a drive-through, so how much time and what your priorities are will help with suggestions."
With Yellowstone closed we are trying to come up with Plan B. Wildlife and beautifulscenery. We are adventurous and like off the beaten path type of travel. The last time I was in the area was 33 years ago.
When is your trip? Right now there is still a 14 day quarantine for visitors in Montana.
June
I'm following the Covid-19 orders for the States and Counties we will be traveling through. We will not violate the orders.
"Well, no way yet to know when Yellowstone is opening. Depending on when in June your trip is, there may be a big difference. If Yellowstone is not open, there is a chance that other tourism will not be as well. This may be a question best answered closer to the travel date, and even then, if the park opens and things go badly, the area could close down again."
"I found this article pretty easy to understand. https:/â€¦When the govt. shutdown happened and the parks were closed, many people saved their trips by tourism outside the parks. I just don't know how much would be possible if they are closed due to Covid-19 concerns and not because of budget. Two entirely different scenarios."
Thank you
