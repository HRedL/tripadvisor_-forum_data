"And if so, does it include the ones at hotels? If they are closed still, and idea when they are due to reopen? Thank you!"
Everything's open! At least in the bars/pubs field. Some hotels that are closed might have closed restaurants tho like the Ritz is maybe closed. but most restaurants and bars are open
"No, bars are closed, as are nightclubs. The definition of a bar here is a place that does not serve food, so the others will have opened by the simple expedient of providing it."
Really Liz? Wow I was unaware that the restrictions had been lifted to open bars. Establishments with restaurants/serving food have opened I know but I must have missed this!!
"Natalia, All cafes and restaurants are open and bars and pubs that also serve ""bar food"" are also open. enigma..."
This is good to hear if true that they are open right now. Hopefully with some type of limitations though.
"Just wondering if there is an update on this? I mainly want to confirm that the restaurants/cafes are still open, although if there are any open air bars with a view open, that would be great to know, too! Thanks in advance."
"Liz D, All bars, cafes, and restaurants are open in Istanbul. There are no Covid-19 restrictions on them. enigma..."
Many thanks for the quick response!
