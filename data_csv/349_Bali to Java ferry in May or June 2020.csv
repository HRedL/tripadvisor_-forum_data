Any info on the ferry running between Bali and Java? Thinking to move around a little. I know there are some flights open but as I understand one must show health certificates and such.Thank youM
"It would be best to stay put where you are right now. It's unclear day by day what the government regulations are for travel between islands but even people who want to travel to their homes in Java are being discouraged and even not permitted to travel. This is to protect you as well as others, just fyi covid19 spread is much worse in Java than it is in Bali."
"Hi,As MangoMunky says, currently to use the ferry between Gilimanuk and banguywangi you need a health certificate and a good reason to travel. Currently the only people allowed back into Bali by ferry have to have either a Bali KTP or a KITAS. This may change after Idul Fitru but unnecessary travel is discouraged at the moment. Cheers"
"Thank you for the updates. I am going to ask some hotels in Banyuwangi and post back. Re the mysterious virus that ""will kill millions"" but at the same time does not produce disease in most people. What a joke. Politics."
"Metaxam - this virus may not be serious for you or many others but for the 320,000 plus people who have up till now died and the countless others who are in ICU or have lasting effects from having caught the virus, this is not a joke. People such as yourself who do not take warnings seriously are responsible for the deaths of others. This virus will continue to spread and kill if idiots such as yourself think its ok to go where and when they wish for their own convenience"
i think going to java is easier... but coming back to bali will be difficult if u dont have balinese KTP or KItas
"I'm with Ginny on this. Meta is exactly the kind of person who should not be travelling and possibly spreading covid. Unfortunately, I see these types of selfish people too often in Bali right now, who refuse to wear masks, even where it is required, and who brush up next to people in public places. Chances of contracting covid are very high when you are exposed to others who have it, and the physical distancing is one component of the fight against it. Right now worldwide there are almost 5 million active cases, one month ago there were less than 2.4 million cases."
"Are you saying this from your own experience or from the TV news reports? You should refrain from slander as this is a public forum; calling me an idiot only proves your low IQ. This is a scientific matter first of all. You don't know what you're saying, you're just repeating what you read in the media."
"Thank you @ Qures Y. Very helpful.Edited: 11:15 pm, May 18, 2020 "
Maybe you should head to Italy for your break. For some first hand experience.
"I don't need your opinion on a medical subject or how this is the end of the world. Read again my question. Don't worry, I won't infect you; just keep your mouthpiece on and you're safe."
Definitely an idiot.

"Please read Recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia number 61 and 62.Previously East Java is number 3, but nowadays is number 2, after DKI Jakarta in number of positive Covid-19 patients, so maybe tomorrow I think use ferry maybe will same as use flight, need health certificates and such. Maybe you can go to East Java, but maybe you cannot go back to Bali. You are not definitely an idiot, but think twice."
"Indonesia records 973 new COVID-19 cases as East Java becomes new epicenterDeaths have increased from 36 to 1,278.I was surprised to read this in the Jakarta Post this morning.I know and understand you don’t like the media reports."
"I have mentioned it at Recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia number 61."
"Again, I don't need your medical opinion even if you are doctors. You are reading the news and then post them here without checking the accuracy.I've created this regarding the ferry."
"Which posts so far, have been inaccurate?"
"I think he’s referring to the posts criticising him for wanting to visit Java despite the scientifically identified risks, Calla. Apparently, it’s all a beat up?"
Not sure if it's allowed already but best to contact the site BaliFerry to confirm. I have booked with their site twice before. Cheers.
