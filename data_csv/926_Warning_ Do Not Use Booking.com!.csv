"I utilized a site for finding the cheapest hotel rooms for Miami, FL. This site utilizes multiple websites , including Booking.com. Booking.com had the cheapest price for a hotel close to the Port of Miami. The reviews appeared to be good and it listed the room as ""Free Cancellation"".After booking the room, I received my confirmation email from Booking.com and it showed that the room I chose was non-refundable. To cancel the booking, I have to pay the room rate. I tried communicating with Booking.com via email and phone. They are not helpful. They forwarded my complaint to the hotel and said to wait for their response. No response. I emailed Booking.com again and I called them. The rep on the phone was not helpful. She kept blathering I chose the room that was non-refundable. I do have a screen shot of what was being offered and submitted it to Booking.com. If I get no satisfaction, I will file complaints with the Attorney General in the State of Florida and with my home state. By the way, the site seemed to inflate the rating of the hotel, it was listed as a 3 out of 5. Since my booking, it is now rated as a 2 out of 5."
"did you look at the terms of free cancellation? if you hover over the ? it states the conditions, not all are free cancellation, some say that first night will be taken etc, just a thought"
"The devil is often in the detail. In principle, I believe that nothing should be described as free cancellation unless that's exactly what it is. There should, in a perfect world, be no requirement to go digging for more information. The trouble is that we don't live in a perfect world and it's the hotels that give Booking.com the information on their rates and polciies. It's disappointing if Booking.com aren't interested in helping to sort out any discrepancy, but there is a limit to what they can do."
"Did you click on the lowest rate offered? I've booked and canceled a lot of Booking.com rooms and it was always clear what is cancellable and what is non-refundable. Plus you have to confirm everything a second time and their terms are in big bold type, not legalese in a tiny font.Are you trying to change or cancel the room? That seems to be the reason everybody gets mad. They book a room at the lowest possible price and then get pissed that they can't get a refund. But always in the end, it's not Booking .com (or Expedia, Hotels.com, etc.) that says no, it's the hotel. By your logic, Trivago or whom ever you used that led you to Booking.com should also bear responsibility.And good luck with the FL AG siding with a consumer over a corporation."
"""Free Cancellation"" is the source of much grief to people who don't apply critical thinking. Since a third party merely agrees to be your proxy and provide certain services, mostly booking for you, paying for you, and if needed, cancelling for you. And when you read their Terms & Conditions, something I'm pretty confident you didn't do, even though you checked the box that said you did, you almost always find they specifically tell you it's all between you and the supplier, just as if you were doing it for yourself, and they're not responsible for the supplier's conditions or performance. So, ""Free Cancellation,"" when displayed on a third party site, most reasonably means that the third party doesn't charge you a fee to cancel for you. Since they've nothing to do with the supplier, they can hardly promise anything about the supplier's policies, extra fees, taxes, etc. And, as per their T&C, even if they meant the hotel said they would cancel for free, they can speculate that the hotel provided inaccurate information, but they told you that might happen and that it was not their responsibility. You also agreed to resolve any dispute through binding arbitration. it's up to you to figure out how to initiate that. And I can tell you with considerable confidence after many years in an attorney general's office, that you will be politely listened to and will eventually informed that there's nothing appropriate for them to do, and that you may pursue any other legal options on your own behalf."
">>>So, ""Free Cancellation,"" when displayed on a third party site, most reasonably means that the third party doesn't charge you a fee to cancel for you.<<<You are, of course, correct. This exactly what the phrase means with many agents, particularly those that book flights or flights plus hotel.However, my experienc eof Booking.com is that it's been very clear as to what free cancellation means. I've just done a search for rooms with free cancellation at a British seaside resort, and there 96 results. All say free cancellation a sI'd requested, and when I click on the individual hotel to find out mnore, it's all there, including the date that you have to cancel by.Having cancelled a few bookings myself, it's always worked exactly as it should. I've never been charged a penny."
"I'm sorry but I don't agree with a lot of what's written here. Booking.com are deliberately trying to mislead people into thinking that they can cancel bookings free of charge. How many travel agents (either online or on the highstreet) charge cancellation fees nowadays? Nobody would use them if they did. I don't know what was shown in the ""hover over"" info when my son booked his accomodation and it's rather irrelevant anyway. In booking.com's reservation confirmation email they state the cancellation policy is one thing under CANCELLATION POLICY, and then way down in the email under PAYMENT there is a sentence with the word policies which is a link. When you click the link a new window opens and the cancellation terms appear to be different, although it's not completely clear. Why state one cancellation policy in the main body of the email under CANCELLATION and then another from a link way down in the email under PAYMENT? If this doesn't classify as misleading and confusing then not sure what does.I also disagree that you don't have a contract with booking.com once you've booked your accomodation, because youcan cancel your reservation via booking.com and they hold your credit card details in their database. I believe that your contract with booking.com may end once you check into the hotel. Additionally, just because you give your credit card details to a company, it doesn't imply that they can charge the card willy nilly. They're supposed to to tell you if they're going to charge the cardMy son has been trying to find out what he's been charged for for over 2 weeks, both from the hotel and booking.com and neither will explain anything. Meanwhile he' s been charged £126 and has another charge of £400 which has been pending since 28th May, hence reducing his available balance by £400!"
">>> I don't know what was shown [ ... ] and it's rather Irrelevant anyway <<<>>> I also disagree that you don't have a contract with booking.com"" <<< "">>> I believe that your contract with booking.com may end once you check into the hotel <<<These are your opinions, which you are of course entitled to post. They are not facts."
"""How many travel agents (either online or on the highstreet) charge cancellation fees nowadays?""What on earth are you talking about? The great majority of agents will charge cancellation fees. For many, cancellation and change fees are probably their main source of income. Without knowing what your son booked it's impossible for anyone here to check if the terms of cancellation are unclear on the Booking.com site."
"Booking,com aren't trying to mislead anyone. I've cancelled half a dozen reservations in the past year and never been charged anything under the 'Free cancellation' description. I've never sene any mismatch in what was shown on the screen and what appeared in my conmfirmation, so I'm at a loss to explain what happened with your son."
A common problem is people pick a hotel that offers free cancellation but then book the lowest cost room. Usually the lowest cost room can't be cancelled. That's why it's cheaper.There are also hotels that require a deposit on rooms that can be cancelled. People don't understand it's a deposit.Have to admit it scares me when people say what's written (and they've agreed to) doesn't matter. READ what you're agreeing to. You might be signing yourself up to indentured servitude.
You're right. When you go into the hotel page you can see plenty of different rates and often different room types. One always has to take care that the correct type and rate is selected.
"Here is my update to this situation and some inquiries. I read contracts daily as part of my employment and I read the terms and conditions with Booking.com. I had a screen shot of the offer before I booked it. I contacted Booking.com by their website, email and phone call, all of which lead to no satisfaction. I contacted the State Attorney General Offices for my state and State of Florida where I filed a complaint. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in one of the home states that Booking.com is located. I received immediate action on Booking.com's part with the BBB contacting them. They reviewed my complaint at a higher level and admitted to me on the phone that they could see I booked one room and another was issued with my confirmation. They said that this happens on occasion and apologized. They canceled my reservation for free and sent me their confirmation and one from the hotel. I have continued to let the State of Florida precede with their investigation as I believe this tactic happens far too often."
See my full response and update. I read contracts as a part my job and I have been vindicated with Booking.com apologizing and cancelling my reservation for free..
"Booking.com is responsible for their site and liable, as well as the hotel. Since I had screen shot of what I was reserving; I received a full cancellation with no charges to my credit card."
"Sorry, you have a misunderstanding of third party suppliers who utilize their websites for use by both the first party supplier and the consumer and their legal responsibility. Taking alternative recourse, Booking.com conceded that there was a switch with my reservation and canceled it for. By the way, I do read the terms and conditions at websites I utilize for my protection."
">>>I utilized a site for finding the cheapest hotel rooms for Miami, FL. This site utilizes multiple websites , including Booking.com<<<Considering what you claim you do, you aren't particularly clear with your OP. The above seems to indicate you used a meta-search and clicked through. There's a very good chance in such instances that there were multiple levels of policies, and whilst there may have been an error on their part, your allegations of it being a 'tactic that happens often' there's little to qualify that as factEdited: 3 years ago "
"It's difficult to follow individul replies. It's better to either quote parts of the message you're referring to, or to address the poster by using their screen name. The reply buttons don't give any indication as to who you are replying to.I'm pleased that Booking.com have helped you. To me, that is the sign of a good company. I agree with KVE, though. I can't see any evidence that this a deliberate or frequent occurrence. If it was, there would be far mor ecomplaints about it than there are."
Surprised about inflated ratings?
"I just posted the same issue with booking.com. Booking with ""no credit card required""- Payable at the Hotel When I received the confirmation, it says Non Refundable and the booking cannot be cancelled otherwise I have to pay the full amount.- It has a lot of instructions includes that the hotel may ask me to send the payment via wire trf - Pay cash at the HotelI requested to cancel it as I cannot get to the hotel due to their limited transportation service so I decided to cancel. Booking.com, however has an auto response saying that I need to pay the full amount of my booking. How can they collect the payment If I have not provided my credit card information? Thanks"
You don't need to post the same scenario on multiple threads. All that does is spam up the entire forum with same topics. It's just etiquette. Your posts may then end up being deleted as duplicate
"Susan, you are correct that using Booking.com per their terms and conditions that you agree to at their site, a contract does exist. In fact, the contract is between the consumer, Booking.com and the hotel. I went to the Better Business Bureau in the States and the Attorney General of the State of Florida and I received my free cancellation from both Booking.com and the hotel."
">>>Susan, you are correct that using Booking.com per their terms and conditions that you agree to at their site, a contract does exist. In fact, the contract is between the consumer, Booking.com and the hotel<<<Even after all that, you either can't read or choose to ignore what's written.""By making a reservation through Booking.com, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the Supplier with which you make a reservation or purchase a product or service (as applicable)""I suspect you visit the attorney general frequentlyEdited: 3 years ago "

"I think Booking.com hook people in with a headline price and you only see the true price when you look at the small print (and it was literally small print, that I missed due to failing eyesight). We booked a week in a hotel in Dubai for a price quoted as 'approximately £1187'. Then we saw that a 10% Property Charge and 10% Municipality fee and a AED 20 Tourism fee per night were all excluded.So the £1187 ended up as £1453. Why don't they advertise the price you will actually have to pay? Same as sites that advertise flights without including airport taxes. Misleading.On a positive note, I type this wearing my new glasses that will, hopefully, stop me missing more small print charges!"
"<<I think Booking.com hook people in with a headline price and you only see the true price when you look at the small print (and it was literally small print, that I missed due to failing eyesight).>>You're free to think what you like, but booking.com don't set the prices nor do they upload the prices. That is down to the individual properties so complain to them about 'hooking' people in. There is no small print on booking.com website, even without enlarging it it can easily be read. The fees you quote are in bigger print than the actual room facilities which are listed above them. They even have Not included in bold type above them. ""Not included: 10 % Municipality fee , AED 20.00 Tourism fee per night , 10 % Property service charge .""I've also never seen a site that advertises flight prices that doesn't include airport taxes."
">>>On a positive note, I type this wearing my new glasses<<<Hopefully that will help you find a SpecSavers thread next time, as it has nothing to do with Booking.com"
"Do not use Booking.com. They are often times very overpriced. For the price of a standard room on booking.com, you can sometimes get a deluxe room with sea view if you book directly from the hotel's website."
">>> They are often times very overpriced. For the price of a standard room on booking.com, you can sometimes get a deluxe room with sea view if you book directly from the hotel's website<<<The term 'They' comes up so frequently when referencing room rates.'They' is not Booking.com - 'They' that set the rates on Booking.com are the hotels themselves. So you can thank the hotel for actually putting up rubbish rates."
"Same thing happened to me!!!! I would never have booked a non refundable hotel but it absolutely didn't say that until I got my confirmation email and it also liked highly reviewed on their site but I get looking on other sites and it was rated way low!....I wanted to cancel but couldn't or they'd charge me!...we went and it was horrendous!! Dirty, pool broken, air conditioner didn't work.... I wanted to cry my poor kid drove 8 hrs with me saying they could swim when they got there and the pool had been broken for 2 months!!!! Do not use bookings.Com... I used expedia for our hotel on the way home and had no surprises or problems..."
"Mindy, the words ‘Non-refundable’ or ’no refund if you cancel’ or ‘Free Cancellation’ or ‘Free to Cancel’ are shown right near the type of room you are booking. You would see that before you click to book it. That’s what I see when I look at hotels on the booking,com APP on my IPad. What hotel did you book?It’s always best to read reviews on various sites including Tripadvisor before you book anything, not afterwards. By checking and comparing you get a good overall picture of what a hotel will be like."
You obviously work for or are invested in this company and you are full of crap.... I used bookings to book this one and expedia for the other and expedia made it completely clear which ones were not able to canceled and bookings.Com completely did not! They are a crooked company and their reviews are fake!
>>>You obviously work for or are invested in this company<<<Don't be ridiculous.It would be the same as us saying you are a shill for a rival agent.
"Oh dear. Mindy, do you mean me? No I don’t work for any company. I’m one of this forums volunteer Destination Experts. Just pointing out that when I look on their APP on my iPad (I’m researching Brisbane hotels at the moment for a weekend away) I can see the details showing whether it’s non-refundable or has a Free Cancellation period. I recently learned how to use Google Docs so just took a screenshot photo and this is what I see for the hotel I’m considering and it is quite clear:-https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KiH-fVon…I’m unsure why you didn’t see the terms and conditions of your hotel booking before you clicked to choose the room and book it. Which hotel are you talking about."
You're wasting your time with complaints. It's your mistake. Hotels set the cancellation rules for their own hotel and relay this information to the third party sites (like booking.com). Booking.com is actually part of a larger company that is comprised of 6 other brands (https://www.bookingholdings.com). They are only a third party that takes your payment. Your grip should actually be with the hotel if you have an issue.

"No the Booking.com reviews are only able to be done by the guest or someone allowed by the guest (or booker). Only those with completed stays can post a review, unlike a site like this one where any yahoo can post a review about anything whether they've been or done or not. The fact that you failed to read the booking information that was readily available is the fault of one person... hint look in the mirror. Your lesson to learn should be not to avoid a legitimate booking platform, but rather to read the terms before submitting payment. It ain't hard."
"Please don't hurl silly accusations around and insult other members for not agreeing with you, Mindy. You just undemrine yourself and your credibility when you do that.The fact is that Booking.com is not a crooked site. They make it very clear indeed which rates are non refundable, even before you start the booking process. What's more, their reviews are highly likely to contain far fewer fake and untrue reviews than you'll find on Tripadvisor.You might not share this opinion, and you're entitled to ignore what everyone else is saying if you so wish, but that doesn't alter the fact that you're opinion is wrong."
"<<I would never have booked a non refundable hotel but it absolutely didn't say that until I got my confirmation email and it also liked highly reviewed on their site but I get looking on other sites and it was rated way low!....I wanted to cancel but couldn't or they'd charge me!...>>It absolutely did say, many times, before you got your confirmation email. How on earth you could have missed it I have no idea. People write reviews, and funnily enough, not everyone thinks the same way about the same things lol. I have no idea what other sites you saw it rated very low, but booking.com are one of the few sites that actually verify the reviews are authentic, so the person reviewing has stayed there. Plenty of sites don't and like TripAdvisor are full of fake reviews. Swimming pool not working etc has nothing to do with booking.com. Blame the hotel for not updating their advertisement!As for accusing Avanti of working for them and being full of crap. Take a look in the mirror because you could be accused of being full of crap as well."
You guys can say what you want...I know it did not say it was non refundable....I just want to help others not go thorough what I did and I do believe their reviews are fake and I do feel they are an awful company that people should weary of using.

"Mindy, it would really help others if you named the hotel so we could avoid it on booking,com and also if you wrote a review of it here on Tripadvisor to warn people how bad the hotel was. If you need help finding it’s reviews page here on TripAdvisor mention the hotel name and city and we can help you find it."
"Mindy, even if what you are saying is true then it still has nothing to do with booking.com. It's the hotel you should be calling awful. They're the ones responsible, and they're the ones that caused the problems!"
"Lol, it's clearly not the hotel or the booking platform. It should be rather obvious here where the problem lies.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Mindy, you an remain in denial if you so wish. But please give us the information we need to avoid the hotel in question. Because no one who has replied is going to avoid Booking.com based on what you've said here."
"Don't ever book through booking.com, we booked an apartment and agreed a time of check-in. The owner never arrived at this time and after standing at the meeting point of the apartment for 50 minutes, 4 phone calls and 3 emails we decided to find a place to shelter from the rain. Charged 50% of the booking as they were available for checking 2 hours later than agreed. We even had email and phone record evidence but booking.com wouldn't assist. Bye bye 750 euro. Be very careful when using the site and the terms and conditions as check-in for apartments can be at any time preferred by the owner, even if prior arranged."
"I think your post should say don't ever book a private apartment through booking.com. I don't think anyone would argue on that one. There are far too many unscrupulous owners out there. They are responsible for the information about their property that appears on booking.com so if they're not adhering to their own check in times then that is down to them, not booking.com."
"We would like to provide feedback on the apartment via the site we booked (booking.com ) but can’t, therefore can not warn people of the apartment owner and his processes. My suggestion is to avoid all bookings on the site."
Nothing to stop you mentioning the name of the apartment on this forum.
Navona Bernini Lodge
The ratings on booking.com from guests seem ok. A score of 9.2 on 33 reviews.Checkin 13:00 - 15:00 is indicated.Did the owner give you anything in writing that you can show booking.com that he agreed to a part refund due to the mix up on check in times?
<<My suggestion is to avoid all bookings on the site.>>For what reason? If the owner says you can have a part refund then they need to notify booking.com of that. Or they could just refund the money themselves and then get it back from booking.com.
"I’ve used booking.com several times - 4 times in the past month and have never had an issue. The cancellation terms are pretty clear when you read them. A lot of times even when the listing says “free cancellation” the lowest rate available will state that it doesn’t apply to that room. As far as the rankings go, the number of stars is based on the reviews themselves. I don’t find it unreasonable a property could go up or down one star in a short period. This is especially true if the total number of reviews isn’t that high. If a place only has a handful of reviews I generally don’t put a lot of stick into the overall rating"
"Yes we have written email confirmation from the owner and evidence of all the phone calls and emails sent to the owner and Booking.com. Booking.com refuse to send us the recordered conversations. Access to the apartment was given after 3pm but we didn’t want to return after being yelled at by the owner down the phone (he wasn’t happy that we called Booking.com and complained, as we stood on the street for so long) Tricky as we can’t post feedback and I wonder if this has happened to other people, hence no bad ratings shown."
">>>I think your post should say don't ever book a private apartment through booking.com. I don't think anyone would argue on that one.<<<I certainly wouldn't argue. I have no qualms at all about using Booking.com for hotels, but I wouldn't go anywhere near them for apartments or any other rentals. I think this is a clasic example of how problems can arise with owners. At least with a hotel you can normally just turn up and check in without any prior arrangement.>>>They are responsible for the information about their property that appears on booking.com so if they're not adhering to their own check in times then that is down to them, not booking.com.<<<LeyLand is abosolutely right. Booking.com are not responsible for the owner's failure to appear at the appointed time, nor for you not wishing to stay n the accommodation once you gained access."
I agree- I will never use bookings.com. I tried to cancel 48 hours before checkin and they were going charge $100.00 per adult for canceling. What a rip off. I will NEVER use booking.com
"55.Would you care to share the cancellation terms you agreed to when making your reservation. Then ""we"" will be able to advise you."
"debbieBooking.com weren't charging you anything. The hotel was, and you agreed the cancellation terms when you booked."
"Booking.com don' hav a cancellation policy, debbie, it's the accommodation that you book through Booking.com that have cancellation policies and it' they that will charge you."
"I booked Furnished apartment in Dubai. I received a message that the booking did not go through as credit card declined. Immediately, i directly emailed the property agents to resolve the issue. No response. Since, then have called Booking.com thrice, made international phone calls and put hrs of time discussing the issue. They said no issue the booking will remain as non-refundable. The next day i receive a message, booking has been cancelled. Also, on the website the property has increased the pricing more than 2 folds.Summary: 1) I missed booking other properties because of this deal and now pricing for other properties have gone up. A financial loss for me.2) My money and time is wasted on phone calls to booking.com and property.DO NOT USE BOOKING.COM as they can't be trusted."
Poster 59 is spamming booking.com threads with the same message. I'm not even sure what his problem is. His credit card was declined so not charged. Not sure how that is booking.coms fault. Perhaps ringing the card provider first instead of everyone else would have been a wise move ;)
"Never book through booking.com, we booked a stay in Bali, did not receive any confirmation, then were told the transaction was not accepted. we booked another place, then while in Bali received notice that we were a no show and the stay fee was deducted. they also charged 2 nites (one nite would have been acceptable). booking.com should act as an agent and confirm that the booking was made successfully. here they said they sent an email, we did not receive it, and they also can not produce the email sent. there is no service here, just a commission grabbing middle man. beware."
"I assume hat it was Booking,com who told you that your booking was not accepted, If so, then that should be more than sufficient for you to contest the charge for the original booking with your card provider."
"indeed one should not use booking.comI had several unpleasant encounters with them - among them - they did not delivered message from the hotel about being full (despite confirmed reservation) which I discovered too late. Another was trying to cancel reservation to an hotel (drei lowen in Munich) which suggested ""airport shuttle bus"" which turned out to be pricey taxi cab! I called and wrote them couple of times (did you try to find their emails or customer service phones...? very difficult to find) but to no avail.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Booking.com do not ‘pass on’ messages, the process is automated through their extranet. If you didn’t receive a message from the hotel, it’s because the hotel did not send you a message.Any message TO the hotel, you won’t get a reply unless the hotel replies. There’s no human involved, Booking.com is not involved.Descriptors and information about a hotel are loaded by the hotel themselves. If it suggested a taxi, your gripe is against the hotel."
"1. In the case where I did not receive the message - it means that their ""automated "" process failed. 2.in response to your comment ""Descriptors and information about a hotel are loaded by the hotel themselves. If it suggested a taxi, your gripe is against the hotel"" the point you are missing is that the reservation was made VIA booking.com, why aren't they responsible? that's the point I was making, they take their commision but are responsible for nothing. Who would support such a company"
"1. No it means the hotel didn't send a message. If booking.com extranet wasn't working the whole world would know about it. 2. They're not responsible because they don't act as agent or principal. They're a an advertising/data transfer platform, nothing else. They are not and cannot be responsible for what info properties upload to their platform. Properties pay a commission on confirmed stays. If you don't stay booking.com gets nothing, the property gets free advertising."
"Dear ""destination experts"" -what, I wonder, are you getting from booking.com that deserves such ""devotion"" ??Based on my experience and that of other I still advocate my fellow travelers - do not use booking.com, contact the hotel/b&b directly, this way you support local business and not the big corporates AND.. you 'll be getting better customer services and discounts!"
"Mainly what I see in replies are qualified at most endorsements of booking.com. Most of the complaints I see are problems with the hotels, not reading the terms and conditions, etc. and the regular responders on this forum are just trying to educate people.Many regular responders also state they prefer booking directly when possible, but have used booking.com in some circumstances. I guess I just don't see the devotion as you call it. Frankly if I was booking.com and I was paying the people on this forum to lobby on my behalf I would fire them and get better writers who would lavish praise on me."
">>>do not use booking.com, contact the hotel/b&b directly, this way you support local business and not the big corporates AND.. you 'll be getting better customer services and discounts!<<<Comments like this aren’t very carefully thought out.By avoiding the big corporates, you think it helps the smaller businesses? Here’s a quick question,Say you’re heading to a destination you’ve never been to before. How exactly do you know the names of the hotels there to contact them? By looking through the larger OTA’s and their affiliates. Without them, the businesses would not have any global exposure- unless they spent millions on advertising. You think small local businesses have that sort of spending power? No.If all the large OTA’s were to go out of business, the travel industry will be back to the stone ages. You’ll be back to looking at Yellow Pages, and take you weeks to find out information that’s available to you in seconds. Not only that, by removing the OTA giants, many of the small businesses would not survive. They can’t compete on their own marketing.The devotion from the regular contributors as pointed out by Pryzk, is for us to give back to the travel community, and to teach people like yourselves who need it the most."
"<< I wonder, are you getting from booking.com that deserves such ""devotion"" ?? >>Nothing, nada, zilch. You obviously have no idea what booking.com actually is, and your business skills seem to be the same level. Sorry, but if facts aren't explained to you your knowledge will never grow."
"I am now more convinced than before that these people are booking.com advocates,pls read here more about the ""good"" practice of booking.comhttps:/…2017-09-17-booking-com-manipulation"
"I would have been more impressed with a link to a TA post that shows people actually advocating for booking.com. As I stated in my previous post # 68 what I see is people explaining how the system works, not advocating for booking.com.I guess people will believe what they want to believe. It seems more and more of that goes on in the world today."
"I am now more convinced that Rina M is an advocate for a rival of Booking,com and has been sent here to complain, and must be getting something out of it from the rival company."
I have experienced exactly same problem you had. Booked a free cancellation room but the confirmation email said i had booked a non refundable room. I will never use booking.comin my life.
"TonBetty, If you intend to honour the reservation, then there is no problem."
"Are you absolutely certain that you did book a free cancellation rate? I usually see a number of different rates which include non refundable rates as well as some with free cancellation periods (where it is offered at all).I'm not saying you definitely made a mistake, but it's surprising how easy it is to do so, especially when you are tired, in a hurry or distracted by something."
"It's not booking.com fault if a hotel books the wrong room type and sends out the confirmation for it. It usually happens when the booker selects the wrong drop down box though, and mistakenly books the wrong room."
"You are so right about Booking.com and Expedia are the same Booking.com App is totally dysfunctional , took me an hr of trying all ways to change dates and had to call the hotel in India to do it myself. Expedia didn’t even send a confirmation email so no record of it at all and again had to call Jaipur to confirm my booking. Had I booked with the hotel I would have got it cheaper too.should have known better than to use them, They sent me a flight itinerary for the wrong day a year ago and i had to find a hotel and fly next day! Will do it all myself from here on in"
"If an app is, in your opinion, dysfunctional then use the desktop site. It's not rocket science!The rest of your moan has nothing to do with booking.com."
79. This has nothing to do with BDc
You were looking for a cheap room? Why??? Haven't you read all the sorry tales on TA from suckers that wanted to save a few bucks and lost lots of dollars. All of this should stop. Thank you.
"So far for me Booking.com has been one of the better one out there. However it's rate seldom better than Agoda (I reduced using Agoda due to a bad experience) or Trip.com.One of the reason why I use Booking.com is usually the site don't take money first but pay at the hotel. 2nd I just found out recently when I needed to cancel a non-cancellation booking, the site informed me they will check with the hotel if they will waive the cancellation fee which the hotel did. That was a incredible nice of both Booking.com and the hotel."
"The simple truth is that you can save money by booking a room through booking.com. Not always, but sometimes. And if I see that a hotel is offering a cheaper deal through booking,com, then I will go for it."
Post #82 completely ignores the fact that Booking.com sells suits in some of the most expensive hotels in the world.Issues has nothing to do with cheap rooms
"<< Issues has nothing to do with cheap rooms >>Agreed, but someone has a very skewed perception of things, and equates all things OTA etc to cheap everything."
Indeed. Bu at least someone seems to have tripped themselves up by revealing they have used AirBnB!
Couldn't agree more
"I've also had a terrible experience with them lately, largely driven by Covid-19 and them not honouring their own Force Majeure Policy. Never again!!!"
"Their policy is a request for the hotels, not for themselves to follow. If the hotel behaviours unscrupulously, that isn’t the responsibility of Booking.comBooking.com aren’t representatives or agent for the hotels, they are merely a reservation platform"
