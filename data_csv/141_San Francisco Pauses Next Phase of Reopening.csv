"But Muir Woods is reopening.https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Muir-…All these reopenings and pauses in reopenings show how arbitrary so many of these decisions are.Edited: 6:45 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Muir is opening but at a much lower capacity than normal. And no shuttle. Not to mention that since the reservation system began at Muir, crowding there has been greatly lessened. That was a year or more before Covid. There is no crowd issue with opening Muir, which is outdoors, which there is at a hair salon or tattoo parlor in SF.Alcatraz remains closed. Although that is not at all clear from the Alcatraz Cruises website. If anyone is interested in Alcatraz, they should first check the NPS site for Alcatraz (I made this mistake once already). And simba, since you think the entire pandemic has been overhyped by the media, I wonder your thoughts on the spikes in various southern and western states? Where not only cases are rising extremely fast, but hospitalizations and percentage of positives in testing are as well.I disagree with your use of the term “arbitrary.” Inconsistent across jurisdictions (local and state) perhaps. But without ANY defined policy from the federal government, every state and local government is doing what it can. And needless to say, politics and the economy are often taking priority over the health of the citizens these government entities are supposed to protect. And whatever you say, you can’t earn a living if you’re sick or dead."

"""All these reopenings and pauses in reopenings show how arbitrary so many of these decisions are.""It shows just the opposite. Decisions are being made from the science and the facts as they present themselves. Pretending that ""like a miracle it will just vanish someday"" still continues to be an ignorant statement."
"All these reopenings and pauses in reopenings show how arbitrary so many of these decisions are.That's because we don't have a national policy. In countries that have tamed the virus (China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Italy), they have a nationally coordinated policy."
"""All these reopenings and pauses in reopenings show how arbitrary so many of these decisions are.""In the US, there are 50 different chieves. Then down to the county levels, there are hundreds more mini chieves. Down more to the city levels, there are many more micro chieves. Who may choose to do things differently as they see fit. And then there is one person who thinks he is ""chief of chieves"" but he is not doing anything.The latest, (and I paraphrased his words here): I don't joke. I don't want testing. The more testing you do, the more Covid cases you will find. That just looks bad. Classic ostrich strategy. Right on!I am shaking my head. This is just a Cluster X. We will be in this for the long haul. Watch Seth Meyers putting together the ""USA Covid curve"" compared to many of the countries in the world. New Zealand has ""43,000 Fans Pack Stadium for Rugby Game After New Zealand Beats Coronavirus"". We have protests on mask wearing laws."
I wish Santa Cruz would. Please stop coming here. Residents are so angry with our local government right now.
SccaI read your law enforcement can't enforce mask less and social distance either. And the solution isOpen the beach. Sit and enjoy.

I mostly look at number of deaths, since reducing that number is ultimately the highest priority objective. I'm seeing number of deaths trending down across the country, and trending flat in California. I personally don't know anyone who has even gotten the virus, much less died from it.The current 7 day moving average of deaths across the US is 604 per day. That's compared to an average of 8000 deaths in the US each day in 2019. I don't rely on the media to tell me what's going on because it always sensationalizes things, I look at charts and data. I don't see anything that alarming. https:/…https:/…https://update.covid19.ca.gov/https://www.smchealth.org/san-mateo-county-c…Here's a press release from the state of California as of June 26. It doesn't sound too panicked to me. SACRAMENTO – The California Department of Public Health today announced the most recent statistics on COVID-19. California's positivity rate – a key indicator of community spread – is trending modestly upward in the 14-day average. Hospitalization rates over the long-term are showing a slight uptick in the 14-day average. California has 200,461 confirmed cases to date. Numbers may not represent true day-over-day change as reporting of test results can be delayed. There have been 3,771,314 tests conducted in California. As testing capacity continues to increase across the state, an increase in the number of positive cases has been expected – increasing the importance of positivity rates to find signs of community spread. There have been 5,812 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic."
"I follow City’s decisions, if they say to delay reopening, so be it, they have reasons. We all wear masks in the Bay Area, people I see everywhere are wearing masks, nobody I know debate the mask. Everybody at my company wear masks, in all colors, I put on my mask when entering office. I went to lunch with colleagues in nearby Daly City, I went to bank today, everyday everywhere are wearing masks. Looking out of my car windows, I see everybody wearing mask."
"To be effective, California needs to ban people from Texas and Florida from coming to California."
"The closer threat to California, especially in the south, are folks from Arizona and not those from Texas and Florida. Glad San Francisco is staying stricter than most."
"Funny thing. I was talking to a friend’s sister who lives in AZ. She thinks AZ spike is due to irresponsible Californians partying at Havasu. Everybody wants someone to blame. If people would stop making this a mixmaster and stay home, the spread would slow."
"While so many of the posts are true, I'd like to add, despite Madeline's arguments, that many SF and Bay Area businesses are open and need support. Some businesses can not open per the mayor, so be it. Yet it is important all of us support local businesses with take out, with store purchase deliveries or pick up and with generosity, All of us must be gloved, masked & adhere six foot distance without exception. The fact that others may disagree or disregard these details. speaks volumes about them. Nonetheless, commentary about others does swat for each of us and our families if/when we pass by people like this.The fact that some of us cannot engage with friends/family per these restrictions dictates that we need to be inventive & creative. I won't kiss someone throw a window, but I will do other things. None of us know who might be infected moving forward. Love and kindness shown in many so ways heals each of us, as well as, someone else.Does a friend and/or a neighbor need a hand with something? Is there a charity you can contribute to that will help? Does a stray on the street need a can of Friskies or Iams? Step forward, as best you can (all of us can) and consider what might help another.My two cents,Globe"
"I hear complaints from Arizonaians too that S. California brought it there! Then again Arizona could have brought it to S. California. We canceled our anniversary trip to Sedona the beginning of June. I’m so glad we did. They were just started to open up and part of me still wanted to go. I’m glad we didn’t. Really travel should be limited to a 200 mile or less radius at this point. Obviously don’t travel if you’ve been around anyone sick. When you travel you should act like you do at home. Social distancing, wash your hands constantly and wear your mask. That’s just my two centsGlobe2 there are a lot of Facebook groups that helperS and those in need of help can join in their community.

^^ It means it's not as prevalent as many would have you believe.
"Positive test results have doubled in CA (to over 5%) and TX (some metro areas to 10%). So more cases is not about more testing. Hospitalization rates are up. Houston hospitals may be overwhelmed soon. AZ is not in a good place. Kentucky has had discussions of who gets treatment vs. who doesn’t. Deaths will follow in a couple of weeks. In some states, and CA is bordering on being one of those, this is a fire through dry grass. Because states opened too early and not in line with what their metrics indicated was safe. Furthermore, even for those who get it and recover, many have severe and life long damage to their health. Many of whom are under 50."
Eighty Percent of LA County businesses that just reopened did not follow the guidelines to be open I saw it myself.It doesn't seem possible but It is
"Every epidemic or pandemic is going to have hotspots and places where there are relatively few infections. SF is not Houston or LA. To try to characterize what's happening in general by focusing only on hotspots is exactly what you're not supposed to do.If you just want to talk about SF, cases spiked on June 22 to 87 cases. Then by June 24, which is the latest date SF is showing for data, was down to 21 cases,which is below average. And let me remind people that only a tiny percent of those positives will result in hospitalizations or deaths. On April 6, there were 212 hospitalizations in SF for actual and suspected cases of COVID-19. On June 25, there were 67 total hospitalizations for actual and suspected cases. That's been the pattern all along. Up and down. The rise in cases will be headline news. The decline in cases - crickets.. Here in San Mateo County, hospitalization rates are down. Statewide, the 14-day moving average of positive cases is currently at 5.3%. The lowest it's been is 4.1%. The goal is to keep it under 8%.""Eighty Percent of LA County businesses that just reopened did not follow the guidelines to be open I saw it myself.""Really? You went to every business in LA County and observed that 80% didn't follow the guidelines? Statements like that are why I place so little credibility on the Chicken Littles.Edited: 9:18 pm, June 27, 2020 "
I place no credibility on people who still think that COVID 19 is just like the seasonal flu.
I place no credibility on people who think COVID-19 is like Ebola.
Ok my fault.When LA reopened restaurants and bars. 80 percent of those businesses did not adhere to the guidelines that allow you to be open.Ive seen about a dozen places that aren't following directions.I won't return to those places either.Didn't mean to excite you Simba.I'm a lazy typist.
Also Madeline s 3rd paragraph is talking about CA. LA is just about 2000 cases a day.
"Covid-19 is not like a common flu. Covid-19 is not like Ebola. Covid-19 is what it is. Just look at all the things about it so far. It is the most contagious and lethal virus the modern world has seen so far. And we don't have any containment yet. The 14-day incubation period (very long), asymptomatic, and ease of transmission make it so dangerous. With Ebola, symptoms show quickly and the patient dies fast. If you see a person infected with Ebola, you wouldn't go near him/her. With Covid-19, you can be shaking hands and high-five'ing with someone carrying the virus without symptom. A few weeks later, he/she may just have a soar throat and shook it off but you may be dead.Don't need to take anybody's description as anything. Look at the facts collected by medical professionals. Maybe we need to pass the point where over 6 millions people die world-wide before you raise an eyebrow. We are far from it yet."

"#20 of 29 ·^^ It means it's not as prevalent as many would have you believeOr some people don’t have a very large social circle. Also happenstance. I know two people who have had it. Actually 5 if I count their families. A close friend got it in my county when at the time we only had a 100 or so cases and another friend got it that now lives in the Hudson Valley of NY. Her family took a trip to London and Paris at the end of February. They were all sick within days of coming home. One friend tested positive while having it the other did antibody testing. They are still sick, better, but no where near normal. Idk don’t know of a flu that lingers for months . These are teenagers and people in there late 40s and early 50s. I can’t imagine what it would be like if you weren’t in perfect health. My concern is for those that have family at home on chemo. You’re so incredibly medically fragile at that time and we have people making political statements over a piece of cloth over their face. People caring for ill people deserve more respect, stop playing follow the leader. I guarantee the slowest of you is smarter than him."
Hopefully people will quickly and speedily focus in on social distancing measures and reduce the number of new infections quickly. its so important to build and develop these habits now so that we can maintain out progress in the future. Momentum is key in the health industry ad also consistency. Lets hope this ends quickly! Stay safe all!!
">>Don't need to take anybody's description as anything. Look at the facts collected by medical professionals. <<Hear, hear! (I mean that literally, everyone please listen to this and stop relying on what you see in your own circle or on Fox News or what your 'gut' tells you.)"
"Government ......especially but not limited to the federal level.....has utterly failed to educate the public about the virus including how to analyze the data. So because of its simplicity and its necessary metric, we were told that bending the curve was highly desirable.....and it still is because it correlates with the ability of our medical facilities and personnel to properly help virus patients. And as a society we did bend the curve and flattened it.But we did not bring about the crushing of the curve that Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, the EU, and, yes, even China....if to be believed....have done.Crushing the curve would have to an acknowledgment that we are still very much in the first wave. But that would require honesty in government.I think Mayor Breed is on the right track. We need to be vigilant. We are not crushing the curve, and because it is impossible to stop folks coming in, including those who think we are doing great, we continue to need to be very cautious."
"I work in San Francisco for decades, have homes in SF and nearby San Mateo county, restaurants are open in San Mateo, been to restaurants 3 times. The only thing I missed the most in 3 months of shutdown is restaurants. The reopening is not as expected.First, very few San Mateo restaurants are actually open, I called over a dozen places, most are take out only. Hard to understand for a business owner, I’d think all small restaurants would be more than anxious to reopen to survive. Obviously not. My take is most are afraid to open for their own safety, I am a bit surprised. . 2nd, restaurants food was not as fantastic as I thought or remembered, how I missed it for 3 months. Afterward dinner, I thought it was not worth risking our lives for. 3rd, 2 other restaurant outings were with close friends and family member, those were fun and memorable, food wasn’t as important. Right companies made the food memorable. I miss a good Japanese meal, none open yet. I miss Gyu Kaku Japanese BBQ, but not open yet. Hurry up!"
"""I’d think all small restaurants would be more than anxious to reopen to survive.""One explanation I heard that makes sense is that restaurants operate on such thin margins that it doesn't make sense to open at only 25% or 40% of capacity. I went to my gym for the first time today in four months. Only two people were working out. The guy who owns the gym isn't sure if it will be able to survive."
"Reopening too soon was not smart business 8n the long run. As the numbers continue to rise, even fewer people will feel safe going out. Other counties that successfully opening up now had the willpower to knock the virus down to a very low level first and then everyone continued to wear a mask. Maskless idiots are the defining characteristic of our response."
"25% or 50% is better than 0%, you got to fight on. Never give up never surrender. You must reopen. My business had 7% sales in April and May, triples to 21% sales in June. We are thrilled! We are back in the game! 3 months of uncertainty was gone the moment we saw 21%. We know we will survive and thrive. Never give up never surrender, giving up is not an option."
"Look how well that worked out for FL, TX and AZ. People read that stuff and they’re more concerned than ever about going out. Opening too soon does no one any good (and does some a whole lot of bad). Additionally there isn’t enough time built in between the phases to check the impact of the previous phase."
"""25% or 50% is better than 0%, you got to fight on. ""It's not worth reopening if the cost of rehiring cooks, dishwashers and servers is more than the money you can bring in while operating at limited capacity."
"With regards to gyms, one in West Virginia is tracking down 200 people because one member tested positive. The “small space, congregate place” rule would IMO preclude using a gym. Regardless Norway’s experiment."
"Went to dinner in Burlingame, only table of guests was us, it is now the safest time to dine out. Called 5 restaurants from SF office, this one was the only open restaurant among 5. Do not confused SF Bay Area with rest of the country where large number of people refuse to wear masks. Everybody here wear a mask. When out walking, oncoming pedestrians across the road to keep a safe distance. You don’t do these for other people, you do it to protect yourselves and families. Close business when you can open, that is one element of success or failure, to give up without even trying is defeat, mentality of a salary man. It is not a matter io making money for the shareholders, but to keep paying salaries and benefits to all employees, without that, they all go on unemployment line. They all have families to feed and mortgages to pay. Safety is part of the management practices and responsibilities. Responsibilities is the burden of leaders, hiding is not an option.Edited: 11:12 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"“Responsibilities is the burden of leaders, hiding is not an option.”Some countries and some states have leaders, and others do not. Some have puppets who cater to political or philosophical factions that don’t see public health as an issue that overrides everyone’s narrow private agendas. Some simply hide, while others hide behind rhetoric, blame-placing, and deflection. We’re in a complicated time when any leader of any party, ethnicity, career background, social standing, or any other “tribe,” should be decisive, seek out the best counsel, and focus on uniting the people. Those who don’t are not leaders, but “leaders.”You know things are weird when Page 1 of the San Francisco forum goes back 13 days, and only two threads besides this one have been active today. In the past, one day’s activity could cover a page or more. The whole state has under two pages for today. Even the Las Vegas forum, always the busiest on TA, has less than two pages.I hope this means that the article below is mistaken, and people are putting off risky travel for now.https:/…"
"I am confused about our governor, on one hand I have been impressed with the fast actions and dedication, I have to admit I always liked him even before he was the mayor; but if I only look at end results of COVID condition, the result is absolutely terrible, not so much San Francisco which I’d doing relatively good, but California is not good. It is the end results which matter. All the fancy steps and talks don’t mean much than actual results. If you compare California to many countries, such as Vietnam with no death, or many Asian countries with a handful of death, or NZ or Australia, list goes on and on. Why is it with our most advanced technologies, brainpower, wealth, professionalism, we messed up so badly? I know simpletons will bring up Trump again, but we locked down first, we were isolated, Trump no longer matter much to California, why did we do so badly? You can’t tell me Vietnam, Hongkong, China or Taiwan are smarter and better than us? COVID is just way over the scale, nobody can do better, but again, look at these other smaller countries, they could. Why could we? After all, we are California.Edited: 12:12 am, July 02, 2020 "

#43Taiwan was on the news. Their leaders actually planned for a pandemic after SARS. I believe other countries are smarter than us. Look at our educational system. The US is ranked low in healthcare and education compared to other countries.We can't even wear a mask.And our government? Nevermind.
The Vice President of Taiwan is an epidemiologist.....Lots of liberal democratic Asian countries have American trained experts in the cabinet and high ministerial official positions.
"I can’t figure out why California did so poorly. Newsom seemed to be doing the right things ahead of the nation, yet we messed up too. Why? Whose fault is it?"
"In my opinion California opened too soon. There was too much laxness around Memorial Day. And why should bars open? Talk about the perfect transmission zone. Our curve a month ago was going in the right direction but it was not low enough to reopen as much as we did. Consider how low NY got before they began even the smallest bit of reopening.

"I think the images of packed party bars are back East, South or Ozark, not California? Sort of a redneck thing. Not being a “bar” person, I don’t think people hug and kiss in there, my impression of bars is from walking pass bars and movies. They are usually dark with lonely men sitting and drinking in sorrow. Maybe the bar ban should be more specific, only the busy happy bars are banned, sad lonely bars are allowed to serve alcohol."
"“ I can’t figure out why California did so poorly. Newsom seemed to be doing the right things ahead of the nation, yet we messed up too. Why? Whose fault is it?” I agree we were doing great and it’s really disheartening to see where we are. Newsom was getting it from people that wanted to open up in April and now he’s getting from the same people that just want to order their rosé next to the beach. He can’t win. Imo what Madeline said true. We opened around Memorial Day, SIP fatigue and the national leadership such as it is got bored with it all at the same time. People started traveling to California from other states and within the state. People just stopped paying attention. A large portion of us are pretty dense and only can see about a foot beyond themselves. My county had very low numbers until after Memorial Day and we had a memorial service for a sheriff killed by a right wing boogaloo lunatic. Unfortunately the 100s, maybe 1,000s, of police officers from around the state didn’t wear masks. The memorial service was less than a mile from my house and people were really upset that they weren’t wearing masks, at all. Protesters were smart enough to wear masks but not police officers that traveled here from the around the state. Our numbers our still low but since that memorial our numbers have tripled and all those attended went back to their communities."
"I went to a friends for a socially distanced dinner party (in the garage with the door open). Let’s of people having meals outdoors on Chestnut St, many of which are NOT socially distant (don’t know who is enforcing that). Heard a lot of fireworks as we ate and chatted in Pac Heights but I saw basically no cars and few people on my drive home about 9PM. A few fireworks heard in my neighborhood but not much worse than a normal 4th. I did appreciate that there wasn’t the massive crowd that usually crams into the Marina for the entire day getting drunk, rowdy, leaving trash on the sidewalk and being noisy throughout the day and into the evening."

"I see nothing 'beautiful' about endless booming fireworks and firecrackers even when it's not 4th of July! For weeks now, we've been witness to the nightly spectacles. But last night was the ultimate. I thought these private fireworks displays were considered to be illegal. Now it sounds as though local officials and the police are okay with them because many residents are too cooped up due to COVID-19? Some of those loud booms sounded like bombs went off. And those poor cooped up souls needed to emit these bombs past midnight until 3-4 am! Gosh, I feel so sorry for them (not). We tried to navigate our street except some louts were blocking traffic and boldly let off their pent up frustrations with multiple fireworks, barring us and other cars from passing. To me, this lack of regard for fellow residents does not add any positive aspects to SF at all. Even the dogs, including mine, are petrified each time there are these useless private firework displays. Some suffer so badly that they need to be tranquilized.Edited: 6:29 pm, July 05, 2020 "
110 fires had to be dealt with by SFFD. Majority caused by fireworks. Obey the law. Respect your fellow citizens.

Or suggesting that illegal fireworks use is just another element of cultural diversity? People usually don’t mind having festivals or parades in their neighborhoods and generally welcome them, even if they do bring some inconvenience. Those activities have what we once called “redeeming social value.” And as long as folks behave, they don’t have an inherent risk of fire, disabling injuries, or trauma to animals, children, or people with some health issues who might not even be near the actual incident.The Fresno FD was so swamped by fires that it stopped responding to medical cases other than cardiac arrest. Let’s hope no one died as a result. In Los Angeles, fireworks abuse may have contributed to poor or unhealthy air quality, and even worse, caused a fire that spread to a building and burned out eight residents. https:/… https:/… And here is a story about a city’s official fireworks show that went sideways (maybe literally) and started a fire that burned several acres.

"#54, the most idiotic defense for use of illegal fireworks I've ever read. Actually, I think it's the only one because who would even try?"
"7/4 private fireworks happened every year, as well as news about fire departments, did you all complained about it every year in the past? Or just this year? or just angry old people constantly complaining about neighbors and young people? If you just moved to San Francisco, welcome. It will happen again next year."
"Yes. There are always private fireworks happening yearly, but this year's was the worst ever! Seems like you're oblivious that this year the fire brigades were going from one fire to another 110 in total. All of that resulted in displaced residents and lost livelihoods as businesses were destroyed.FYI, residents have been complaining about these illegal fireworks since Memorial Day. Nightly booming going off even up to last night!"
"I have known angry old people all my life, they are always angry about something or somebody, now that I am an older person, I do my best not to be an angry complaining old guy. I remind myself that I was young and reckless once, I was different, I didn’t always follow rules, I didn’t drive 65. Most things we don’t like or don’t agree with or find annoying can be tolerated. Just take a deep breath and move on. Different opinions? Naturally, we are all supposed to different. After all, this is San Francisco, this is not Modesto."
"Eh, not only 'angry old people' have been complaining. And I refuse to believe that peoples' differences need to result in endangering others' lives regardless of residence."
"We are awaiting news of our flights from UK but are sure they are going to be cancelled, whatever, we won't be visiting this year. Busy cancelling hotels and car hire, sorry to be missing it but hope to visit another year.Stay safe and well people."
Thank you Penny for your kind words. Stay safe and healthy.We were in London twice right after terrorist acts. It hard to believe that it has almost been 19 years.To me this feels scarier as it continues to unfold. And for essential reasons holed up in DTLA with the looting and civil unrest. The business core is boarded up with grafitti and filth. You won't be missing a thing. To think LA was on top with James Beard awards and a Renaissance to this. I saw part of a briefing with Mayor London Breed. I like her. She seems competent and doesn't look like she's part of the mafia. Being near a nuclear plant and having false alarms I know we're hosed if we have to rely on our Mayor and council.
"I agree fireworks were much worse this year. Yes, it happens around New Years and Chinese New Years and the 4th of July every year, but it was at least 3 times more this year. We could see at least 10 full, long fireworks displays from our house going on in one valley between us and the Daly City hills. Yes, they were pretty, but a lot of the fireworks were very, very low in elevation in city built of wood--and they weren't just roman candles or bottle rockets but full on fireworks displays. Someone spent a lot of money for some of the displays, I'm guessing into the thousands or multiple thousands of dollars based on how showy and how long some displays were.They mostly didn't bother me personally since not many made it into really close range to our house and weren't excessively loud, but they are tougher on animals and people at closer range and are a huge fire risk. There was a fire in McClaren Park and also a 6 year old boy was shot and killed in the Bayview as he was watching fireworks.I get that people are tired and fed up with restrictions and want an outlet, but we've got to think of this as a marathon and not a sprint. It's not going to just go away next week. We need to do sensible things for our own sanity, find a balance with the restrictions and our society and not let up just because we're tired of it. I've noticed people slacking off more about being careful (stuff like not really distancing) and notice it's harder to keep things up myself, but it is important to do what we can reasonably do. I think most people here are trying to be conscientious, but some people not so much. I do know someone who had covid-19 (someone I work with) and he was under 40 or so and in good health and was very sick for three weeks or longer. We were not exposed since he had already been working from home for 3 or 4 weeks when he began showing symptoms. My husband has a colleague whose father died from it. It is definitely out there and I expect most people will know people who have gotten very sick and maybe some people who will have died before this is over.Hang in there and do what you can to stop or slow this thing down."
"“I saw part of a briefing with Mayor London Breed. I like her. She seems competent and doesn't look like she's part of the mafia.”I don’t think the Mob (at least not THAT one) is very influential in San Francisco these days. There was some action in the past, around the 1930s to the 60s or so. There were always rumors that 1970s Mayor Joe Alioto (of the Sicilian immigrant family that started the fishery and seafood restaurant businesses) had Mafia connections. I don't know that it was ever proven for sure, but he did get into legal trouble.We’ve had our share of scandals and corruption in high places in recent years, but now we have our own home-grown graft (google Ed Jew, Leland Yee, Mohammed Nuru – a former long-term BF of the mayor, Tom Hui, and Linda Crayton). I’m sure there are others that I can’t remember right now. We’re happy to let New York and Las Vegas have the Mafia, because we’re quite capable of producing our own crooks."
"The San Francisco Zoo will be permitted to re-open as early as July 13. The Zoo will likely have mask wearing, social distancing, visitor limits.....the latter regulated by requiring timed entry reservations. We are members of the SF Zoo, too, and it is quite nice with lots of open space, albeit with a few “houses”....Kind of out of the way, which makes it more a resident rather than visitor attraction. L streetcar limitations might impact access imho."
#66Frisco that was a fun read I enjoy reading Teri Sforza at OC Watchdog. I thought Leland sounded familiar. She covered that story. I love when corruption is exposed but more so prosecuted.

"We have been out dining about 8-9 times in neighboring San Mateo county since the reopening, going out again tonight with a small group of friends, party of 6.I usually call multiple restaurants before I leave office, find one that opens between my San Francisco office and San Mateo county home, only about 1 in 10 is actually open for dine in. Restaurants with open signs are mostly for take out only, best to call first before parking.For lunch, nearest open restaurants are in Daly City, nothing is open near office in San Francisco. I miss sushi, but found none yet, a famous Japanese ramen place is open, only open Japanese place I found."
"At most of the restaurants we went to, my wife and I were the only table of customers, at couple places, there were maximum 2 tables, far apart. Most customers are not going out to eat yet, that is good news, this could be the safest time for indoor dining. It was a little stuffy in restaurant last evening, our friend requested air conditioning, but restaurant said they keep doors open without air con for fresh air, which is safer. I was at Lowe’s Tanforan on Friday, it was busy, at Office Depot on Thursday, not busy. Everybody wore masks. I wear 2 layers of masks, different materials, I heard on news, different materials masks are more effective. I keep 6-8 masks in my car. People in the Bay Area are well educated good citizens, we all wear masks. I don’t wear mask where out walking in the open air, by all reports, open air outdoor with social distance is the safest place."
"Many counties have had to back off the indoor dining. Sonoma and Marin are two. Santa Clara too I think. SF has not yet allowed it.Anyone who read the article about a sick woman in China dining in a restaurant who infected 9 people, none at her table but all in the path of the ventilation system, would know better than to dine inside. I certainly wouldn’t.Edited: 2:03 pm, July 13, 2020 "
Aerosolized virus + confined space = enhanced risk of infection.
"Governor Newsom shuts down all restaurants in California today. Governor Gavin Newsom Orders Indoor Service At All Restaurants, Bars, Movie Theaters In State To Close Again; No End Date Given."
"How could we’ve messed it up so badly? We are the cleanest, most advanced, most sophisticated, smartest and richest state in the world; the tech center, entertainment center, agriculture center, the best and brightest are all here. How could we’ve mess this thing up so badly? Again and again. I really don’t understand it."
"San Francisco has now made it onto Governor Newsom’s watch list: https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/art…Edited: 9:51 pm, July 17, 2020 "
""" Again and again. I really don’t understand it."" #76 We are all aware now (most of us) that this thing is not going to vanish overnight.Other countries that are slowly getting on top of it have competent national leaders."
"The world is sick and tired of hearing Post 76.That was about 30 years ago.And if I was a POTUS or Governor I wouldn't be wagging that finger to the Middle East, Russia,China.Korea had missiles at our shorelines in the 90s. But let's just chant our way while other societies advance.SARS2 is a test of how dirty people here really are.I'll wear my shield mask and gloves and hope for the best."
I agree Mac. I believe our society is going the way of Rome. Nothing lasts forever. Such as us.
"Maybe TA could start a new forum ""Apocalypse and Lamentations."" This isn't the end of the world, but apparently it's the end of civility and common sense."
Speaking of civility...
"Seems quite civil in my world. There is your own reality and there is a TV/web news reality. Don’t confuse both, unless you live in a neighborhood where people refuse to wear mask and you know many people are sick with Covid19. I work and out shopping at Lowe’s and Popeye, everybody wear a mask, everywhere; in my office, in store, 6’ apart in check out line, in bank and with protective shield. I see nobody congregate in groups. Do not confuse people in my world with people elsewhere in the news who refuse to wear mask or crazy party crowd, our local hospitals are not packed with COVID patients. My Bay Area is very civil and responsible, but you may live in a different communities with nasty neighbors. Or is it a reflection of internal demons? You see what you want to see."
"But you live in San Mateo county, right? Big back yard etc etc."
Yes Mac We live in a bubble too. However we are in DTLA on essential business. What we see is an entirely different world.SF isn't civil when they lose a sporting event.It's way more populated here too.You can't get away from people.You are correct my perception is different than most. We're outnumbered here for sure. We're not familiar with this way of life. And it has changed so much.I never knew there was some competition that NoCal was better than SOCal until I started hanging on travel boards. I guess you are now.
"Covid-19 new cases jumped to over 73000 on a single day yesterday. Why are we doing so bad in this country, the US of A? Thanks to many who are ignorant and who are non-believers. Those who still brushes it off as ""just another day"" or ""this is no different than another flu"" need to wake up. These numbers will accelerate for a while before things get better.I have been patiently sitting at home since March 19 when the order in Sacramento came. Not making any trip except doing grocery. Not even downtown Sacramento. I was hoping to see it end in a few months. My fate was determined by others. It looks like this will continue for months on end.What would you consider as ""end of the world""? Half of the world's population wiped out? Oh wait... that can't be the end. The end means population = 0."

"I wear 2 masks, 4 layers of different materials filter more effectively. My custom mask cocktails are pretty comfortable, I can do this for years to come. In early days, mask was uncomfortable for me, but I figured out solutions. Improvise, adapt and overcome. Visited 5 stores today, everybody wore a mask. Nobody debate about mask. I used hand sanitizer in my car before and after shopping, this takes seconds, visited 5 stores today, did that everywhere. I washed my hands first thing after I came home. Things we all can do easily and cheaply.Everybody at my office wear mask, no one order them to wear mask, they wear masks for themselves and as a civic duty.Common sense."

"I also have face shields, at office and as backup in my car, I wear face shield at office. Our San Francisco office is not open to the public, all staff wear masks full time without any demands or requirements from top. I take off the mask when inside my private office, put them on when I go outside my office.Problem with face shield is I forget I am wearing it, until when I drink, but that means it is effortless and comfortable. It gives me relief from mask, while the protection is less, but it does block me from unknowing spitting whatever when I talk to others at work, something is better than nothing.Varies reports say eyes are main entry points for virus, I have 20/20 vision, no glasses, face shield protects my eyes.I don’t wear face shield out about, because nobody wear it openly, I don’t want to attract attention or look out of place, we all need to fit in."
"If Americans would adhere to six foot distancing and face masks/shields, this country would be in a lot better place. The U.S. could sure learn some lessons from other countries: https://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Taiwa…"
