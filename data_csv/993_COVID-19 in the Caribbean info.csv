"So far there is only confirmed case in SVG, a citizen who seems to have caught it in the UK and is now in isolation.The government’s stance so far is that people should take the usual recommended precautions, but there is no intention to close the borders.I’m now getting the same sort of, “What we’re doing about it” emails from SVG businesses as from businesses in the US and the UK."
