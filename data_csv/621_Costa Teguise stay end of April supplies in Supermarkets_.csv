Can anyone advise on the Supermarkets supplies re Coronavirus fears please.We are due 1st 2 weeks in May at Nazaret Mansions but keep seeing photos posted of empty shelves in Supermarkets in Arrecife? We are still hopeful the Foreign office don’t cancel this part of the Canaries.
"No bottled water yesterday in my local dino, shelves empty.Trying to buy sanitizer but none available. I believe all markets are cancelled and schools and many tourist attractions are also shut"
"We are booked for 23rd April but we have resigned ourselves to not going. If the FCO doesn’t advise against going, we might have a pleasant surprise. If I was a betting man, I wouldn’t bank on it."
Thank you for this ...not good at all.
"I agree I dknt think this situation is going to be resolved in just a few weeks, I know lots people rebooking for June ect but even then I dont think worth getting excited."
We are in Arrecife right now. The big Eurospar in town has lots of availability. There’s a few gaps especially in toiletries aisle but they have a delivery of toilet roll today which is on the shop floor still on the pallet. There is a queuing system to limit the number of people in store at any one time. The hyperdino out by the marina has plenty of availability and is quiet with no queue at all.
No panic buying now and all supermarkets open. They seem to be receiving new supplies with little or no problem -- although local temporary shortages of fresh produce are always a fact of life here.
"Due to go to the Nazaret on 5th May for several weeks, have just booked decorator to do some work, things will not be resolved by then"
Jesus folks need to get in in your heads this will taje months to run its course will be at least 5/6 months before anyone is going anywhere and realistically your talking 2021
I dont think its fully sunk in yet many still expect a few weeks then everything will be ok
"Due first two weeks in May but resigned myself a few weeks ago to write 2020 off as far as holidays are concerned. In my view this will not be resolved this year - but then again I'm not a ""viral"" expert!"
