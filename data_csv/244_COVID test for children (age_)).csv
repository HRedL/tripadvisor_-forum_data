"Hi, everyone! I'm a little confused on whether it's 10 and under children who are excepted from the testing requirement or under 10? In other words, will my 10 year old need to be tested?And another question - has anyone in MD successfully got their test results within the 5 day time frame? I saw a few people on here were able to get 72 hour turn around at Passport Health, but their locations in MD don't seem to be doing COVID testing.Thanks!"
"According to TCI Assured website, ""Children under 10 are exempted from this requirement"" (of COVID-19 test). This means that a 10 year old child is required to take COVID-19 test unless TCI changes its rule.As for rapid testing for COVID-19 in Maryland for fast turnaround of the test result, you can start your search by first looking at the website of ""Baltimore Sun"" (June 26, 2020: Article title: ""Walk-up coronavirus screening site opens in Baltimore, using test equipment under FDA investigation""). Best wishes."
"Thanks, Jae!I'm pretty sure rapid testing is NOT accepted by the TCI, only PCR testing, which takes anywhere from 2 to 14 days currently to get results in Maryland (I heard stories of both). A friend's daughter was recently tested at the Johns Hopkins Health lab, and got results in 24 hours, but they only test if you have symptoms and are referred by your provider. The drive-in clinics send their tests to different labs and there's no telling how long it'll take. I was hoping to find a smaller, private lab/health provider that can guarantee turn around time."
https://www.passporthealthusa.com/locations/Call and ask They call the PCR test a viral test.
Thank you! I did call a few locations and it rolls over to the central scheduling number. They told me a few locations in MD don't do it.
Maybe try a different state? I know a few people came from Florida and got tested in NJ. Seems like a lot of work for a trip though. Best of luck.
"Dina, you can think of Rapid Testing as an option or a backup option unless you have concrete information from TCI that it is not acceptable or you have a definite alternative. According to some source, Rapid Testing is called a PCR testing. [For example, “What Is The Rapid COVID-19 Test? And How Does It Work? What is it? Some urgent care facilities, testing centers, and doctors offices are offering a rapid PCR test to diagnose current infection with COVID-19. Rapid tests may be useful for individuals who need to return to work as soon as possible and cannot wait for the results of a standard PCR test.”]My family and I used Sliver Testing instead of the standard PCR tesing (nasal swab), and our sliver testing results were accepted by ""TCI Assured"". As a result, we had wonderful time in TCI for 10 days starting from July 24, 2020. We returned to NY 2 days ago (August 02, 2020).Edited: 10:39 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"Hmm, interesting. I’ll have to do some more research!Is Silver Testing a place in NJ?Edited: 10:48 pm, August 04, 2020 "
I just found out that Labcorp offers at home COVID testing that provides results within 2-3 days. It does say it's a PCR test. Anyone has any experience with this or knows if this is accepted by TCI?https:/…
"[Correction in my previous posting # 6] Sliver test should be Saliva test.You can Google search for saliva test service provider by typing in keywords ""vault health covid saliva test"". From the search result, you can further research what you are looking for.The in-home test result usually has 24-72 hour turn around time. The test result would be either ""Positive"", ""Negative"", or ""Inconclusive"". To avoid rare outcome of ""Inconclusive"", be sure to provide them with more than suggested amount of saliva. We used such an in-home saliva test, and the result was accepted by TCI Assured without any problem. Have the test kit delivered to your home in advance so that you can go through the in-home test 5 days before you enter TCI. Before ordering the test kit, be sure to ask your test service provider how quickly you can receive your result.Edited: 2:22 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"OP: god bless you for going on this forum to ask medical questions. To feel secure, you need to see what the premiere and Govenor said about entry on Provo. After that, speak to your medical professional and make sure (phone calls to the laboratories) when test results are available. It is extremely time consuming for travel but also time consuming for those who have elective surgeries. Nothing is guaranteed meaning test result timeframes. And then, you need the added expense of medical insurance while in Turks and Caicos.Currently, is it really worth all this hassle.Hopefully you get to the beautiful island but ....."
"Most islands are NOT accepting any test where the sample is collected at home... and rightly so.Consider that there’s no way for the lab running the test to verify that the sample was collected from the person whose name is on the report. Could be from your dog for all anyone knows. If the sample is collected at a lab/office/hospital they will verify your identity and certify that the results are for the person whose name is on the report.Edited: 2:31 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"dina""FYI. Unfortunately, the Turks and Caicos authorities denied or COVID-19 PCR test, due to it being administered at home. Despite this test being fully FDA approved, tested in lab, and producing a negative result as requested, they denied its relevance due to the sample being taken at-home. Thus, we were forced to cancel our trip."""
"I asked for people’s personal experiences with test turn around crime. As far as travel insurance: I’ve been buying it for my trips for the past 20 years, ever since I started traveling with children. To me $200-300 is a small price to pay anything that goes wrong during the trip or before the trip."
"Dina you asked about someone's experience with at home test, that is why i posted. Travel insurance is not travel health insurance"
"TewksNC, sorry but I wasn’t responding to you about asking for people’s experience. Thanks for verifying that at home test is not acceptable. I always choose insurance that includes emergency medical evacuation, is this not what they want?Edited: 3:34 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"Dina, no worries, yes medical evac. Keep an eye out on the portal, you never know when things might change."
