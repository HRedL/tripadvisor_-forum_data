I have just heard they will now be requiring a Covid test 5 days prior to arrival in the DR starting July 30. Are they also testing at the airport?
"As of Thursday. From https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/exigi… They will require PCR tests to those who enter the country from ThursdayIn case of not having it, the Government will carry it out and assume the costGraciela Cuevas - SANTO DOMINGO 07/28/2020, 07:01 PMPCR tests will be required of those who enter the country from ThursdayGustavo Montalvo, Minister of the Presidency. (EXTERNAL SOURCE)The Dominican Republic will require, from Thursday, all passengers arriving in the country to undergo a PCR test (to detect COVID-19) no later than five days prior to their entry.As reported by the Minister of the Presidency, Gustavo Montalvo , in the event that a person does not have the test, this will be done at the same airport, and the cost will be borne by the Dominican government.""As is done in other countries, every person who arrives in our territory will have their health condition evaluated and, if the test or symptoms associated with COVID-19 are positive, they will be isolated in the centers authorized with this objective, ""he explained in a speech broadcast by different media."
Are they still doing tests at the airport?

"The suspension of tests is old news. You have to have a negative test result or they will test you at the airport. The President of the DR announced it yesterday but the announcement has not found it’s way onto the Embassy websites yet,"
Thomasgran is right. The latest news is that the DR president announced that tourists need to have a negative PCR COVID-19 test results within 5 days of arrival. This was announced last night. Tourists do have the option of getting a rapid test done on arrival at a DR airport. https:/…This is from the official DR coronavirus govt website. Use Google Translate in Google Chrome to translate.
"Just a little clarity and I guess it is nitpicking. This was not announced by the President, but "" The Minister of the Presidency"" If announced by the President himself, the name Danilo Medina would be mentioned.Thanks for the link Kat!CheersPCMIke"
"After all a.m on the phone. There is only one place we can get it done, and because its for travel it's not covered by insurance $155 each includes the Dr order.Edited: 1:07 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"I don't take correction of info personally, lol. I don't think it's nitpicking at all. Thank you for the clarification, PC Mike!"
Mike I don’t mind being corrected either. We know you tell it how it is & defer to your wider knowledge. Thanks
"FYI, the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo just sent me an email via the STEP program about this latest update to COVID-19 testing on arrival. So the U.S. Govt will send you notifications if you signed up for STEP.https:/…Default.aspx"
The US Dept of State's website for DR Coronavirus info hasn't been updated yet to reflect this new info. I'm sure this will be updated by tomorrowhttps:/…
Winnie - can you share where you found testing capabilities for travel? In Northeast Ohio here also and looking for same.
"CAT...I just received the alert as well...with regard to testing. It reads...The following information has been updated on the Embassy Santo Domingo COVID-19 website:The Dominican Republic has 66,182 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,123 confirmed deaths.From July 30, all passengers arriving in the Dominican Republic are required to present a PCR test that was completed within five days. Passengers who do not meet this requirement or show symptoms on arrival will be tested at the airport. All individuals who test positive will be required to quarantine as instructed by authorities. The way I read it, and I could be wrong. Get the test, because you will be required to present it upon entry. or you will be be required to test at the aipirt. If you test positive, you are not getting to your destination. Please, someone tell me if I am incorrect. Good for the DR! I can't imagine the cost to DR and the simple availability of the test kits(although I have some ides where the tests are coming from). However, while good for the DR, it could be not be so good for tourism. To date, Mexico does not have this requirement."
"Sure, it's called Walk in Urgent Care on Center Rd in Brunswick. They do the rapid test. 330-742-4029"
"Prize, you are absolutely correct.Here is the link again. The current info is updated on the U.S. Dept of State site. You can bring your own negative COVID-19 PCR test result that was within 5 days of your arrival to DR. If you don't have your negative COVID-19 PCR test result, you can get a rapid test done at the airport. If you test positive at the airport, you will go into quarantine. https:/…"
Thanks Cat!
"Is this currently only for US travellers? Likely for everyone. Who pays for test in the DR? Also, not questionning accuracy of tests in the DR but I would definitely get tested at home before leaving.Edited: 4:32 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"Sly, It is for all travelers entering the DR. CAT and I signed up for emails from our State Dept. I believe it is our Smart Traveler Program. Whenever I leave the US, I notify my State Department, provide my Passport ID #, and receive email updates re the conditions in the country I am traveling. So check your version. I received 2 today, 1 re the testing, and the other re the Tropical Storm.I agree. A responsible traveler should test at home, even without this mandate."
"Sly, the DR govt is saying they will pay for the testing done at the airport."
"Prize, I got the same email to. I am also registered with the smart traveler program. I was able to find several places that offer same day results so I too will be taking my test a day or two prior to boarding. I am not about to have any issues in another country."
"Thank you both. Just trying to catch up as it seems like every hour there are changes on this testing process. Did get confused when you highlighted the US announcement but makes sense. Canada will likely update travel site shortly. Still think it's best to get tested before leaving though.Edited: 4:58 pm, July 29, 2020 "
The way I read Cats link ... Even if you have a test before departure that shows negative ...if you arrive in DR and display symptoms you will still be tested regardless of whether you show proof of a negative test.
You are very fortunate to be able to get a covid test with results so quickly. I've been calling around all week and no one in my part of the state even offers a quick covid test. Here I need to wait 5 to 10 days and we are supposed to fly out to the DR sunday. Not sure what will happen.
"Wheresthebeach...I love Smart Traveler! I am glad you were able to find a place. Sly...De Nada. You are right. Info does seem more frequently changing, complicated, and a pain in the butt. The hubbie and I keep wondering if the karma isn't out there for this desperately needed trip. We have one month to change our mind. That's when EEC charges my card, even though we can cancel with full refund. We are also booked at Hyatt Zilaria. They charge 2 weeks prior with full refund 24 hours prior."
Fishfreek....Good luck!
Prize I have been looking at Zilara also as CHIC and the rebranding is taking time to get things organized. Such a beautiful beach and the resorts looks fantastic. I'm gonna wait until late August to make a decision.
"Zilaria looks to be a tad big for us. Most of the restaurants we would like are on the Ziva side. We booked a Club Swim Out. With the sale, it was significantly less than EEC(which was also purchased with a decent promo). But, EEC's offers more perks for it's Club category and comp Anniversary Package. And we know the walking distance and if our combined issues can handle it."
"@ 22, that's the way I understand it as well. If you show symptoms when you arrive you will need to be tested again, regardless of the results of your original test."
SBDriver. A test is only a look at that moment in time. Very small chance but 5 days later you could have been infected and running a temp. If that was the case they would have already flagged you because they were doing temp checks since they opened the airport.
Caribbean travelers: Agree 100%! I do understand they are trying to make it as safe as possible for everyone but not all of us can jump through the hoops in time even though we show no signs of covid right now. If my wife and i decide the risk isnt worth the reward... we are out big bucks in our eyes if we scrap it.
"@29 Yup, I get it. There is always a chance of contracting the virus after you take the test. I *think* the idea is to hopefully weed out potential carriers before they get on their flights, and deal with leftover suspected carriers on an ""as need"" basis. With any luck at all it keeps residents a little bit safer. It's not a perfect system, but it's better than totally banning visitors from certain nations like they have done in the Bahamas.Edited: 7:57 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"This will kill tourism, many Americans will go elsewhere before submitting to a Covid test either on home soil or at the airport. The whole concept is backwards anyway. If you test positive at the airport, that’s an indication others on the plane are possibly now contaminated also. However with incubation they will show symptoms either during their holiday or shortly after returning home. If your going to mandate a Covid test, test before departure. Then if your positive you can return home and quarantine there, and your not risking any contamination to the aircraft and it’s contents."
Fishfreek ... I get your point that you were not given sufficient notice about having negative test in hand landing Sunday. So are you still going? I am sure many travellers were caught of guard by this new protocol and are scrambling .do you risk going and get caught up in quarantine ....I guess now more than ever trip insurance is necessary
"Weluvdr ... I think that is the point ... Take a test before you get to the airport so you can stay home and quarantine if you are positive. If ""Americans"" as you say are not willing to submit to a test in America or the country they want to travel to ... Maybe they should not be travelling"
"Many Americans won’t take a test even on home soil so will go elsewhere, if they have an attitude like that let’s hope they won’t be allowed anywhere, kind of explains the number of cases and deaths in America though if you’re correct (which I doubt)"
"Many of the Caribbean Islands now have somewhat the same requirements for C-19 tests. Either you have one before you arrive, or you are given one when do you arrive."
I hope that once the Vaccine is available that they provide a certificate we can carry (or document on your phone) that might eliminate the need to show negative testing results when you travel. Better yet...an official stamp on your passport. Seems this virus is going to be part of our world forever.
My trip is July 31st - Aug 4th. What Tropical storm are you speaking of and will it be happening during the dates mentioned above?
"In Cleveland we were unable to take the test in advance, simply no way to get it turned around in time and also extremely limited testing options. My doctor as an example, would not approve us for a test. We just cancelled the trip to Dominican last minute and are on our way to St Croix where due to our area being under 10% infections (Ohio) we dont need a test. Im not saying any process is perfect, but I think USVI's process of treating states that are super hot spots different from the rest makes some sense."
"Duncan, you must remember that St Croix is technically part of the United States, thus you should have no restrictions. Whereas the Dominican Republic is an independent nation."
"Duncan.. only 3 states.. AZ, FL, and TX have restrictions to St. Croix .. they do need a negative test 72 hours ahead of time. Smart move though. I’m surprised that you couldn’t get a test in Ohio. We have testing centers everywhere in VA but to the point of others, almost impossible to get results back quickly. Enjoy St. Croix..."
"""This will kill tourism, many Americans will go elsewhere before submitting to a Covid test either on home soil or at the airport.""Where will you go?Many countries will not let Americans in, even with a test right now. And many that do, require a test."
"True..The American passport isn't worth much IMO currently. I think some Americans need to get over being entitled. Those days are long over... We all need to be responsible and do our part... I'm all about mitigating the spread of this virus. As a frequent international traveler, it hurts my soul that the US is pretty much on the blocked list for many countries. However, I completely understand why as some of my fellow Americans aren't as diligent about COVID-19 safety/health protocols."
"Not true, Wahoo. The USVI is requiring anyone from any state in the US with current positive test results of 10% or greater to provide negative test results. The basis for the requirement changes continually and Johns Hopkins' data (https:/…individual-states) is used to determine if a negative test is required for entry. Currently states with 10% or greater positive testing include Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, South Carolina, and Texas.https:/…viewEdited: 7:51 am, July 30, 2020 "
"Crystal.. yep, I looked at an old report. Things are changing daily everywhere. It’s just not worth it to even travel to the USVI.. too many what if’s. Knowing my luck, we’d get there, get tested, get a positive result and have to quarantine! Talk about a bummer!Edited: 8:13 am, July 30, 2020 "
Agree Wahoo. Too many moving parts.
"The idea that ""This will kill tourism, many Americans will go elsewhere before submitting to a Covid test either on home soil or at the airport"" seems ludicrous. I truly believe this is a bias based on what region of the country you are from. We can also see that in some areas, there are no limitations on testing and in others there are. I already had Covid. The worse illness I have ever experienced. I currently have the anitbody (However, not sure how long that lasts). I would be more than happy to test again to insure the safety of others. My husband is tested every week for his job even though he too carries the antibody. I work from home so it is not required. This is very common in our area. The fact that they are requiring the test makes me feel even safer. I wish our country as a whole would be as diligent. Then maybe we would not see the numbers we are seeing."
"WheresTheBeach.. well said and totally agree....hope you are feeling betterEdited: 8:42 am, July 30, 2020 "
WheresTheBeach - nice that someone who has gone through this and is still living through it has weighted in. It amazes me that some people would rather switch to another destination that is slack in their restrictions just so they can have their fun in the sun while maybe putting others at risk.
"I'm thinking anyone near someone that tests positive should go into quarantine too. For example, if P1 tests negative at home, but then gets flags on arrival for new test and is positive, anyone sitting near P1 on the plane should be sent into quarantine.Thoughts."
"Well if my wife gets flagged on arrival and I'm cleared, I'll let her go enjoy quarantine and I'm off to the resort by myself... LOL. Seriously though, that is a good point. Anyone travelling together, what happens if only one member of the travelling party tests positive? Are they going to quarantine the group?"
"Ugh. Senor Cerveza, that sounds like a nightmare :( And no way I'm going to travel anywhere where I have to take a covid test... I'm already looking at postponing to the spring. I'm not scared of the covid but I would be very scared to be carted away to one of their ""quarantine facilities"" without my boyfriend, or to have him taken away. As much as I cannot wait to travel again... I'll be the first one grabbing my passport when these restrictions are lifted, but right now, no way."
"From a friend just a few minutes ago. He had a transfer client on the noon flight from Newark NJ""Catherine took just 15 minutes from landing, getting checked bags, temp taken, Immigrations and Customs til meetung my driver.no covid test done, i guess during todays storm they do not add pressure on the arrivals for a test""."
Arriving to let say PUJ what form of proof of negative test is accepted??On paper?On mobile device?
"kdsmith, could it be Cat S? LOL"
"LOL SlyIf one of you tests positive, then you would fall under the category ""have you had contact with a person who has confirmed COVID-19"" then you too would have to be tested and self-isolate for 14 days . . . so you'd both be sent off to that place in the jungle :-)Straight from the provincial screening document. Bugs"
"@ 56 HAHA... yeah, I'm pretty sure"
"But Bugs, what about the stranger sitting next to you. He/she tests positive, you've breathed in their air for 4+ hours, do you get sent to ""Jungle ""too?"
Hola allI landed at noon today. No COVID-19 test at the airport. I think they have their hands full dealing with this tropical storm today. They did take my temperature though
"Wheres the beach - BooksinPC - I too have recovered/survived Covid (as did my DH/DD & sister). We are booked for PC in Nov - while I wouldn't object to getting a test done if required. I'd like to provide something indicating that I've had it and possibly save the time/test, etc. for others. It hasn't even crossed our mind to reschedule to elsewhere simply to make it easier to enjoy ""vacation""."
"SAReynolds, I believe if you have recovered from Covid you can again contract it. There have been reports of people catching it more than once. I don't believe you are now immuned. You should still be tested again to travel."
"SAReynolds I am so happy you too beat this horrible virus. I wish it on no one. IT IS NOT THE FLU!Drewboy although there are a lot of urban myths about ""second timers"" I have yet to see a confirmed case in a medical journal. However, there are studies and confirmations of shedding the virus anywhere from 2-8 weeks after. You are not contagious at this time but you will receive a positive test while simultaneously having a positive antibody test. As stated before the whole antibody thing is the big question, how long will it last?My personal opinion is that a Covid test should be like a passport. You should not be able to travel without it. It should be checked prior to departure, not after landing. Nothing is 100% But... Testing, wearing a mask, social distancing, washing your hands all together will dramatically lesson the likelihood of contracting or spreading the virus."
Anyone have any clue the specific documents needed for proof of the PCR test? or how to even get a test done and the results within 5 days of leaving?? This just seems impossible.
Can someone update us if they fly between July 30th and August 2and. We are planning to go. Our airline hasn't requested and covid testi.g to enter DR. I'm curious as to how this is all going to play out. We have the negative test but not sure if it's the exact kind they are looking for.
The airline will not check for the testing results before you depart. You will need to show your test results upon arrival in DR
"Trying to find advice on what will happen at Puj, good luck, try picking the lotto numbers, the only consistency will be there will be no consistency, what happens today will be different tomorrow and what happens tomorrow will be different from Saturday, no help but it’s a fact."
"Hi Cat, but did you have your own test results with you to present to them upon arrival?"
"No, I didn't have enough time to get a PCR test. The new testing protocols were announced Tue night and my flight was yesterday morning.So basically I rolled the dice. But I have been very diligent about following COVID-19 protocols in my hometown. I wear a mask everywhere with a face shield, I practice social distancing, etc. Of course, there is always a chance, but I felt confident@. I also mostly did a self-imposed 14 day quarantine before my trip. Optimally, I would have preferred to have my own test results to bring to DREdited: 1:02 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Found out after many calls , you cannot get the PCR test without symptoms in Ohio , you can get the antigen test with rapid results for $155 . Sure does make the vacation idea a whole lot less attractive."
"Drewboy - Everything I have read and looked up through accredited journals - show that more than likely the person that tested positive - didn't contract again but never ""shedded"" the full virus and the test was still picking up remnants of the virus RNA still in their system long after they would be considered contagious."
Just get the rapid and give that to them at the DR
I canceled my dr trip on my way to mexico the wait time for a covid test in nyc is 5 to 14 days
"If that is even possible in your area. I live in Wisconsin and rapid tests aren't available...at least not in my part af the state. I need to wait 5 to 10 days. Neither of us have been sick or show any signs of covid. Not sure if we are going yet or not, we are supposed to leave Sunday with no insurance on our trip so canceling would really be bad for us, we would lose everything."
You are always right on it Mike.
Did your make it to the Dominican Republic with out your test?
AC ... If you have been following you would know that the requirements for entry to DR with a negative test only came into effect Tuesday evening ..and for people arriving July 30 onwards. It seems they were a little lax on Thursday given there was a TS .. but from all accounts testing was done today
"JO71AL, thanks for confirming that testing was done today (July 31). Any idea about what proof they're accepting for the test result? Since test labs in the US don't provide a ""test certificate"", would a printed copy or a screenshot on your phone be okay?"

"Yes, this ideal is getting to be the norm on many resort group sires on FB, Millions of Americans that would potentially travel to the DR or any other Caribe destination that require any testing will save their money for a vacay another time. Testing is met with heavy resistance in the US. Punta Cana tourism was up to 30-40%. Just hate to see it suppressed by a testing protocol that rolled out basically overnight."
"Not sure were you get your information but anyone on the ground will tell you that tourism is not within a country mile of being at 30 to 40 percent, most people would be happy to reach that number by 2021"
Have fun in Mexico. See it moved up to #3 on the death list today passing the UK.
@80 Maybe that's the idea. Slow down the influx of tourists from hotspots????
SBDriver Moves to require testing will start to open up the islands that have it to countries that have lowered their rates of covid and want it to stay that way. If they would just let us in Canada take one after we got home to eliminate the 14 days I would be on a plane tomorrow.
can anybody post updates if you get a test done at the airport? me & my husband are supposed to leave in a couple weeks but we can cancel the trip up until tuesday. i really don’t want to cancel but i’ve called every testing center around me and nobody will give me a test without symptoms AND get it to me within 5 days. just a little nervous about having the test done at the airport and can’t decide what to do.
"Wouldn’t it be nice if companies and governments everywhere all had the same policy and could work together, you have a rapid test before you enter any airport for a departure , may not be 100% accurate but at least reduces the chances of flying with someone who has it and would maybe make people feel much more at ease flying and in hotels around the globe and countries more open to travel"
"If anyone wants to see an interesting video that happened at the airport in DR, watch the latest video from youtuber “roogens”.He shows arrivals refusing to get the test done at the airport and its a big mess Id get tested at home"
I don't get it. To me it is part of travelling that you abid by the rules of the country you are visiting. It seems that a lot of these people feel that because they are on vacation rules do not apply.
To be fair. In the video are they actually tourists or Dominicans returning home.
"I’m assuming if you refuse to get tested you get to get back on a plane and go home. If it happens too much the airlines are going to refuse to take you without a test result in advance, because they don’t want to have to deal with getting you back home that way."
All I saw in that video was mass confusion.
there is NO video of that from him.. unless he posted and took it down within a day or Youtube deleted it
OK..sorry..nvm I found it.. 10 second clip... doesn't look anything like people are not wanting to be tested.. just looks like a plane or 2 arrived and mostly natives
"We just got here today. Finger prick covid test for all of us on the flight (spprox 30 passengers)if you dont already have a negative test( not sure exactly what they except as far as negative test results you may already have).Takes about 10 minutes...stressful as hell...at that point you are good to go or not. I can only speculate what happens to the ones who test positive. I wouldn't do it again, we would cancel before going through that amount of stress again. Now... we have fun and relax!!Edited: 9:05 pm, August 02, 2020 "
what was the stressful part? waiting to get your results? also were you able to wait with the people you are traveling with?
Yes very stressful waiting for results and yes we did get to wait with others who were being tested.
I wonder.. if 1 person on the plane is positive.. does everyone get quarantine then?
Carol A I guess you would have to buy a new ticket to travel home & if the aircraft didn’t have any spare seats they could hold you in custody until they could get you on a plane at your own expense.
Thomsgran No airline is going to let you get on a plane to fly home if you have tested positive. You will have to quarantine in the DR until negative test.
what test do they do to test for covid at dominican republic airport
"I'm assuming that new needles are used each time and that testing material is disinfected between each person tested. Am I correct?Have to agree with Caribbean _travelers. Once you've tested positive, no airline will allow you back on. Hiding that fact could get you into a ton of trouble if you hide the fact and contaminate people in the plane."
So how do you get negative if you are found out positive? there is no vaccine.. just hyrdochoriphon (sorry for spelling typo).. and that's if you are sick... if you are positive.. you will always be positive.. 99% of people who are positive are not sick or have a mild symptom for a day
"<< I'm assuming that new needles are used each time >>Lancet needles once used will be disposed in a sharps bin/container, so one lancet per test. The same as Diabetics use to test their blood sugar levels.Angie."
"Finger prick? I think that's only for antibody testing. That doesn't make sense. If they are testing at the airport, they should be doing the nasal swab. I'm sorry but I'm questioning the finger prick post. Either it's not true, or the DR doesn't know what they are doing.My research shows ""We now have two main types of tests for coronavirus (COVID-19): diagnostic tests (molecular and antigen) and antibody tests (serological)."""
G0G0. Agreed.. blood tests to detect Covid are only in the research phase! Why would they Check for antibodies? Looks like a crapshoot to me. This is clear as mud.
"Not true, there are rapid tests (doing a finger prick) to test for the virus, not just for antibodies. Many say they are not as reliable as the nasal swab but they must have figured it's better than not testing."
"Only one I know of is Biomerica... and it’s not approved for use in the US. If they are using it, there can be both false positives and negatives. That, in-itself, scares the s##t out of me!"
"IS there anyone else who has arrive in the past couple of days who can report in? I'm scheduled to go there on Thursday of this week. I'm going to bring a test, but it's unclear what they will accept."
"I arrive in Punta Cana today around 1pm. Was a bit uneasy hearing the previous comments about finger pricks and expecting the worst. Process was extremely smooth and very well organized for a country with somewhat limited resources. They were not giving the Rapid Tests that those of us from the States are familiar with. It appears they were giving the antibody test, which on the surface makes no sense. However, after speaking with my brother who is an ER doctor, there are 2 strains of antibodies. The first strain (igm) appears when you are actively fighting off the virus and then the s once (IGG) appears when you have successfully become immune from future infection—or at least as far as they know. It appears they are testing for IGM, which is going to detect people that recently got the virus. Essentially, they hoping to stop these asymptomatic people before they unknowingly infecting other people. They conduct the testing in an large terminal with plenty of AC. There is a waiting decent area while you wait for your results with a nice bathroom. They hold your passport while you wait. Temperature checks are conducted via scanners, not individually, as soon as you walk into the building. You won’t even notice this unless you are looking for it. No one was pulled aside of my flight. Once you clear the prick test, you are able to proceed immediately to immigration. There was a very short line and out bags were waiting when we got to the luggage hall. Overall, it probably adds about 15-25 minutes to the process, maybe less if you’re one of the first off the plane. It’s extremely professional and our test taker had a great sense of humor, even with less then perfect English. To be honest, once we finished the process and got in our transport, I told my wife that’s probably the future of travel for a while. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Europe institute a similar process with better virus tech for us US citizens in a few months.Edited: 6:41 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Thank you for taking the time to post,I feel better about the trip. I have been a wreck since they put this in effect. I'd feel even better if they gave more than 5 days to get the PCR test back, which is impossible here in Ohio."
"Hello, I was just curious what you found out about the testing process once landed in DR. My husband and I are traveling scheduled to arrive August 14th. Thanks!"
"Landed at sdq 9am this morning with test result in hand on a full plane with almost all Dominicans from Newark.Once plane landed announcement came that only those with test results will be allowed to disembark first. Those of us headed toward immigration where before line divided in two a woman in army military uniform stopped us and asked to see the test result. She was professional and courteous. We showed it to her, she glanced at it then directed us to the line towards temperature scan monitors where you have to center yourself on screen chest up, it scans, green lights you if you’re ok then we were off to get our bags. If I didn’t have a test result in hand for the woman she would’ve directed me to the line toward a medical station, a table with 3 personnel who wouldve performed a pinprick test. Even with test result in hand If temperature scan red lights, again we’d be directed to the medical station line to be tested. All very professional.I don’t have firsthand account of what happened to all those people remained on the plane without a test result- most likely they were pricked onboard or ushered toward that medical station linecto be tested.I was outta the airport in 10min flat. Got into a taxi to Las Terrenas where I’d say 99% are wearing masks. More than nyc. Literally Everyone. On the beach eating, drinking sunbathing no. I checked into my lovely Airbnb, swam in an empty pool then walked 20min in the heat into town to exchange some money. Got 58pesos to dollar! Everyone here is lovely and kind. Once we got some pesos two of us jumped on the back of a scooter taxi (3 people sandwich on a scooter) to a beach restaurant and on the way passed by a funeral procession - casket covered in flowers on back of a pickup truck followed by another pickup just carrying 5 huge subwoofer speakers blasting salsa music.Appreciative I’m here. Bring a test result. Wear the mask. Sorry for crashing Punta forum.Edited: 2:44 am, August 04, 2020 "
Everything productive written about the testing process is being immediately erased
Yup. No point.
"BaltimoreBlues, thanks so much for telling us your experience. One question. Did you have a negative covid test with you? Are only the people who don't have a test getting the finger prick? Or does everyone get it? I'm wondering because I am planning on getting the test and bringing the results."
"""Everything productive written about the testing process is being immediately erased"".I don't get it. What do you mean?"
"@118 Late yesterday afternoon, many of the informative posts had been ""removed by the community"" for being inappropriate. (like #117 is at this moment)They have since been re-instated."
"Lhatese, could you please specify what test results you presented at the airport? Was it a PCR covid test or  test for IGM (which is going to detect people that recently got the virus)?"
Yes agreed - wondering if rapid antibody blood test performed in USA is OK for evidence even if it is not a PCR test as described by the press release? Those yield instant results vs indeterminate wait for PCR results
"seems like a reasonable approach all things considered, this being the early stages of travel during covid-19 be prepared for changes, as airports get busier once the colder months are upon us I hope they keep diligent with a safe process, Patience will be key for travel for the foreseeable future  travel for now looks to be safer then shopping at your local Wal Mart"
Lhatese thank you for the post #114. Heads up for PUJ Punta Cana travelers: report was about SDQ Santo Domingo not Punta Cana.I wonder if the process is the same at these two airports. Thanks.
"I had no negative test with me. Everyone from my plane was brought into the same terminal hall. I did notice a couple people get ushered around the prick station, so I believe they may have shown a negative test."

"Would like to help put your minds at ease…traveled to PUJ today through Miami. The only COVID test I was able to get my hands on in time was a rapid 20 minute nasal swab since the PCR takes 7-10 days to result in my area. Of course my fear as most on this thread is that they are only requiring a PCR and I was worried my rapid 20 minute antigen test wouldn’t be sufficient. To my relief, it was. When entering the airport you are put into 2 separate lines; ones with tests and ones without. Of course, the line without test results was much longer then the line with results. Since I had my rapid test results with me, I went into the “with results line” and handed my results over and there was no issue. I feel everything was handled very professionally and I was very pleased with my experience flying during this time! If you are able to get any sort of COVID test done within 5 days, you should have no problems getting through with them. Hope this helped ease some minds about the tests they are allowing, safe travels everyone!"
"Kate, TY for the info. Yes, it helped me enormously. I feel comforted about having to be tested to enter. I just hope we can get rapid testing because 6-10 days for PCR. Lab Quest is back logged. I do think it makes more sense to at the very minimum to take your temp before we get on a plane."
"DR says to bring pcr test but bottom line this is what I’d recommend. Mostly to ease the anxiety everyone is feeling:1) Bring any covid test result you can get done that shows you’re negative for virus/antibodies or positive for antibodies against infection. Swab, serology, whatever. This is the best assurance to have relief for you, for everyone.2) Take a thermometer with you so you can reassure yourself thruout the journey and not become so anxious.3) Take some garlic pills to ward off catching any other random food poisoning or just bugs on planes - I use it always as a natural antibac and that always works for me. 4) Bring a sweater cuz dumbest thing that could happen is the freezing cold ac on top of sleepless anxiety gives you a sinus infection.5) If you must get the test, know that DR is using the Roche pinprick rapid test- very reputable, most say the best in reliability. And the medical team giving it appeared very skilled and professional.6) Be prepared for uncertainty: Already have your DR Health declaration form filled out, addresses and contact for all during your stay, take extra meds, extra masks, snacks. Odds are you won’t need it but smart to cover bases without going too crazy in any case.Edited: 11:40 am, August 07, 2020 "
Arrived yesterday to SDQ airport with a negative rapid blood test and was out of the airport in less than 15 minutes
"Just arrived Saturday the 8th. Only had an antigen test, not PCR, and breezed through the check point. As others have written, make sure you go into the “have test results” line, although the line for testing was actually shorter."
They are all Dominicans.
Are they testing EVERYONE that does not have a Covid test result with them or is it random ?
I was there Aug.2-10 and they tested everyone on our flight. I'm guessing only 30 people on the plane. We were the only flight in that terminal as far as I know.... maybe they were just board. Seems like very little consistency as far as testing goes.
"If you bring negative PCR test result not older than 5 days, have no temp - will you go straight to immigration or you may still be tested?"

Got into PUJ today with no test results. They directed us to another line that went right to the immigration/passport station. Checked our papers and we were out-no tests or mention of them.
Does anyone know if the negative test has to have been STARTED (as in nose swabbed) or FINISHED (results delivered to patient) within 5 days? All of the places I've spoken to say it can take up to 7 days to get the test back.
WES try to find rapid test in your area to get result in hours. It is not PCR one but better than none.
"Do you have to wear a mask at dinner or if drinking at the bar?In Jamaica, only place don't need a mask on is in the pool. I really can't see how you can enjoy a vacation if you have to keep masks on in hotels. If everyone been tested, then surely not needed at the resorts?"
"<< Do you have to wear a mask at dinner or if drinking at the bar? >>Some hotel protocols in place state you have to wear a mask entering the restaurants and inside bars but can then can be removed for eating or drinking.<< If everyone been tested, then surely not needed at the resorts? >>There are still travellers who might be asymptomatic so yes masks are needed to protect staff and other travellers.Angie."
"OK thanks, I'm sure this will stop people wanting to travel, as can't enjoy you holiday if having to wear a mask once at the hotel, agree staff wearing them to protect from tourists, But not many people will go away due to this, so the countries will suffer from lack of people going away.I for one won't bother until its all back to normal.Really hope the industry survives. I'm in big chat group, and everyone feels the same, they just want to go relax and enjoy themselves."
"Tony, there are only a few resorts requiring masks,if you look and the hotel page each hotel lists their protocol. We are staying at Secrets and they don't. Nor do any of the Majestics."
