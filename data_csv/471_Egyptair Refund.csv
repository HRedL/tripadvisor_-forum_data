"I realize everything is difficult these days but...Egyptair cancelled my flight over 4 months ago. I requested a refund and got an email reply stating that my refund was being processed. Have heard nothing since then, and when I call their US customer service number, it rings but no one answers. I have no use for a voucher as my original trip purpose no longer exists. Does anyone know of a phone number or email address of Egyptair staff who are actually working?? They owe me $1000 and I don't intend to let them keep it, for a flight they didn't even operate."

"Traveler1. I think you will find that this airline has got a lot of angry customers chasing them for their refunds. You can see what some of them are saying about them in their reviews, twitter and facebook pages. I have done a chargeback on my debit card through my bank, but as this is not a legality that they can be held to, unlike the section 75 on credit cards, I now have to wait to see if the airline claw back the money my bank has paid back to me."
