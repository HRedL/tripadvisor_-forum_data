"We are traveling from San Francisco for 3 weeks in Eleuthera. Any advice on travel from SFO to Nassau to Governor's Harbour. Also, advice on things to do in Eleuthera?"
"I’d look at SFO>ATL>NAS for that leg. Unless you have direct SFO>NAS option.25 minute puddle jumper flight from NAS>GHB (approx $125 round trip per ticket)Best thing about Eleuthera: you really don’t need to DO anything. It’s all about just relaxing and short day-tripping to find fun, unique beaches and taking in the beautiful natural scenery along the way. There are a few landmarks/experiences worth seeking out on your first or second visit - Preachers Cay, Glass Window Bridge, Queens Bath, “downtown” Governors Harbor, Lighthouse Beach - however not necessary all on the same trip. Also, Eleutheras people are some of the kindest you’ll ever meet, so definitely spend time talking to and learning from the locals. Always the best source for sip-sip (gossip) and on-the-island knowledge!"
I’m genuinely wondering how someone comes to have a three week trip planned... without knowing how to get there or what to do when they arrive.:-)
"Sorry, that should say Preachers Cave, not cayAlso, your best puddle jumper options from NAS>GHB are Southern Air or Pineapple Air. Meant to add that tidbit in for you in first reply.Have fun!"
Thank youWe have flight reservations and accommodations booked.
To RJP-NJNew JerseyWe have flights and accommodations already booked.
"To: acbell1Homewood, AlabamThank you so much for your advice"
Do you know if there any celebrations around Independence day or Summer Junkanoo this year in July?
"Your first post asks for advice on how to get there from SFO. Your follow-up post says you have flights booked.No doubt you’ll understand the confusion.:-)Edited: 4:00 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"to: RJP-NJNew JerseyNo Worries, I was asking in the context of COVID-19 changes and/restrictions"
"Get the 'Beach Book' and/or the 'Snorkel Book' by Bret Sigillo ...or just go wherever you like; lots of places to explore and see. My favourite spots are Ten Bay and Spanish Wells. Hire a guide and go fishing or just exploring (pigs, turtles, etc)."
"Hi Melissa D, Typically, their would be a festival as The Bahamas Celebrates it's independence on July 10th, however, due to COVID-19, large gatherings have either been postponed or cancelled.Traveling to Eleuthera is always a fun time! I recommend visiting the Pineapple Fields, spending a day on Spanish Wells or Harbour Island, and checking out the Glass Window Bridge, one of the wonders of The Bahamas. For more options, you can refer to 'Things To Do' on Trip Advisor's Explore Eleuthera Page . You're going to have so much fun!"

"acbell1...Where are you finding flights from NAS to GHB for $125 round trip? I am in the process of rescheduling our cancelled April trip to Eleuthera and exploring our various flight options. I've researched Pineapple Air, Bahamasair, Silver Airways and Aztec Air. I have looked at both NAS and FFL to either ELH or GHB. Round trip tickets range from $180 pp to $529 pp. If you have sources I can't find, would you be willing to share them? :)"
