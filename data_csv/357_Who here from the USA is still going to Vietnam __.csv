"Me and my wife are still determine to head out on our trip next week. Not going to lie, we are a bit scared. But it not because of the virus itself, we are in the medical field and honestly have been constantly expose to alot of other super bug probably much worst than the corona virus itself. Our worries came from how over-hype the whole situation is and that government are putting restriction on a day to day basic. There are no direct flight from the USA straight to Vietnam, all our flight options required a connection from another country. The thought of dealing a logistic issue on flight path can be a pain to deal withBut all adventures came with risks, and the old saying of no risk no reward is what motivating us to keep on pushing on with the trip.So how many of you guys in the USA are still determine to push on with your Vietnam trip ?"
"I just got back this week. We flew China Air and changed planes in Taiwan. We took three domestic flights while we were there. There were way less tourists, which made our trip better. Happy hours are canceled at hotels. And people are wearing masks everywhere in some places we visited. Others, like Hoi An, not much at all. There are signs everywhere and lots of hand sanitizer. But it did not effect our travel experience negatively at all. We got a couple of our hotel rooms at half the cost we originally booked. We did go through some quarantine check points on the way back, but it wasn’t a big deal. Also, the USA wouldn’t let us board our flight back without filling out a form that listed our immediate contact info."
"Canada here, and I am supposed to go on the 20th. I decided that I would plan to go unless things looked really bad a couple days before going. I lose pretty much the same amount of money cancelling now as I would waiting, so might as well wait, with the added thought that if things take a turn for the worse, there is a better chance that the airline will cancel the flight themselves and I get a refund, or my government tells me to avoid non-essential travel and I can claim with my travel insurance.As it stands now, things look good, other than my flight pattern has changed so it will be even more annoyingly long than usual. If anything, I wish I could take an extra 3 weeks off and explore more of Asia with less crowds.Right now, my concern of contracting the virus is low, with most of the concern being on the airplanes what being trapped with other potentially sick people and my immune system being compromised due to lack of proper sleep.Like you, ,ost of my worry is actually regarding my plans following apart due to fallout from coronavirus. - I connect through Hong Kong and have a 3 day layover in Bangkok before flying into HCMC (decided to cancel the planned layover in HK some time ago, but because of the political unrest). Lots of potential for things to deteriorate there leading to me being denied entry in Vietnam, even while I'm in the middle of the flight over. Or even for things to deteriorate while I'm there creating a nightmare when I try to return.- My Vietnam trip includes domestic flights and even an overnight train so potential for my itinerary to go sideways quickly, and while I would like the lack of tourists I'm worried it will also cause issues like not getting to see a lot of markets or having to pay extra to see certain things out of the way because shuttle buses aren't running, etc.Edited: 8:56 am, March 02, 2020 "
"I fly to Hanoi March 5 , via Taiwan. Our flight for March 4 was canceled."
I was in Vietnam and Cambodia for three weeks and just came back a week ago. I would have zero concerns.
"JackieDz, thank you for positive! 6 years ago all our relatives and friends were crying when we did not cancel our flight to Cairo. According to news there a civil war started, one American was killed, tanks are all over and curfew is there. NOTHING above was truth except tanks which were for keeping an order. We had an amazing trip, no tourists around Pyramid and Luxor was empty. I just think that media is too much launched on a coronavirus subject."
I’m still planning to leave March 20 (if Vietnam will have me without a 14-day quarantine and EVA doesn’t cancel my flight. Fingers crossed!)
"we are booked with Emerald Waterways to Vietnam and Cambodia. our flight is supposed to leave on March 30 from Vancouver Canada to Siam Reap with transfer in Hong Kong. Now Emerald Waterways is denying boarding to any individual, whether guest or crew, who has travelled from or through mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and Iran within the previous 14 days. we are now waiting for them to change our flights there. As their South East Asia itineraries are currently operating as scheduled, we cannot cancel. we have the same concern as Kevin C of the risk of contracting the virus on the planes. and the unknown of our flight path.but it is assuring to hear the positive feedback from both JackieDz and redplc."
"My family and I are still planning to visit Vietnam at the end of March for the Grand Prix. We have a layover in Haneda, Japan. I am trying to keep up with the news - don't want to be quarantined for no reason."
"""I was in Vietnam and Cambodia for three weeks and just came back a week ago. I would have zero concerns."" Really zero concerns?? I would be highly skeptical of Cambodia which claims they only had one case from a person who has since recovered, especially given their history of non-reporting. Vietnam took very significant and rapid action when they had an outbreak, so the two countries are not comparable. https:/…"
@sweethi:I've been watching these 2 sites for updates on the situation.https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/informat…https:/…1580226297.htm
"We are scheduled to go at the end of April, so still some time before our trip and we have not decided yet. Our flight home on Singapore airlines was canceled and they moved us to a flight 12 hours later making us miss our connecting flight, so I actually think this gives us a way to get them refunded if we decide not to go.I too am in the medical field and I am most concerned about being infected without knowing and spreading it to others more vulnerable. I also have a major concern that with the way I anticipate it is going to spread through the US now, Vietnam may be restricting our travel by then as they have with other countries with outbreaks. So it may be decided for us. We have to decide soon, and due to my duty to public health I suspect we will not be going."
"Good to know I fly from uk on 10 april subject to gov clearance if things deteriorate , thanks for sharing your experience."
Does anyone have any idea we should expect having a layover in South Korea will be an issue? I have friends supposed to fly through there to Hanoi on 3/28.
"I fly to HCM from Los Angeles via Taiwan with EVA air in mid April. Their website states certain flights are cancelled due to restrictions from China. But my flight us showing confirmed. I see your similar flight was cancelled, marinka - did they give you another option?"
Who cares about people from the USA and the virus? It all pends on the situation in Vietnam and connecting countries.
"> Does anyone have any idea we should expect having a layover in South Korea will be an issue? Well flights from Korea are being redirected SGN->Can Tho, HAN->Van Don https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/can-tho-va…Might be an idea not avoid transit in Korea."
"We are a family of four in Vancouver, Canada, and have decided not to go - departure would have been one week today, to Hanoi, and then returning home 16 days later from Phnomh Penh. Like others, we were okay with the COVID19-related risks, but not okay with potential airline stranding and quarantine. Our return flights via Incheon (Seoul) have been canceled through mid-March and I'm sure will be extended to our travel dates. And our trip there via Taipei has had several flights canceled onward to Hanoi. Super sad - this was the trip of a lifetime."
"DikThai if you can't provide anything meaningful for a legitimate question maybe you should keep your snarky comments to yourself (as you have been advised before). At this point people are asking for information from a variety of sources if they should travel to Southeast Asia. Personally, I have real concerns about traveling to Thailand or especially Cambodia. Not a lot of confidence in the how those governments are addressing the corona issue. I had planned on going from Danang to Phnom Penh but cancelled out that idea after seeing what has developed over the past weeks with Cambodia and Thailand. I am heading back in April and things looks really good in Vietnam right now. Very tight restrictions on those coming from infected areas. Will be interesting to see what happens when so many people come in for the F1 and if there is an increase in corona.The significant decrease in tourists from mainland China and Korea and more restrictions on other country tourists has cause a number of hotels to close down or reduce staff. Vietnam Airlines is rescheduling and reducing flights and is losing 10 million USD each month. The cost to Japan has been significantly higher due to allowing one cruise ship.So hope this provides something meaningful for the original question. Monitor the developments and stay informed. Things (right now) are looking good to visiting Vietnam."
"@Kenneth, We are scheduled to leave on Sunday from Washington D..C to Hanoi with a connection in Doha. I'm thankful for this connection :) Unless something significant happens in either Doha or Vietnam between now and Sunday, we are going!"
"Vietnam has just announced restrictions on travelers coming from Italy. With the new cases, and deaths, from the coronavirus in the USA there may be travel restrictions on Americans by the end of the week. Vietnam is not going to allow visitors from any country with significant virus cases."
@Kevin C thanks for the info :)

"We are scheduled to fly from Denver to Hanoi with a layover in Tokyo on March 11, returning on the 31st. As of today, we are still planning to go."
"Newspaper Courrier du Vietnam of 28 February (my translation) :The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) has decided to remove Vietnam from its list of countries presenting a risk, saluting the efficient fight of the country against the epidemic of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)."
I’m from US and have been on a cycling trip with 16 other people. We started in HCMC in 2/23 and are now in Hue. Everyone is well. Our guide says the places we have visited are empty of tourists. The guide did not encourage us to visit markets or touch animals. He’s also crazy with the hand sanitizer. We have not been wearing masks (although we did on the plane). I would not cancel your visit. But i know it is an individual decision.
@Trek565665 please do sure how your visit is when you travel. It would be very much helpful!
"When our flight was canceled for March 4, we got another flight on March 5.Last night I checked in on line for JFK-Taiwan . I hope it would not be cancelled. Already there is a mess in my itinerary."
"We are still planning to go on March 21st and actually looking forward to it! I'm grateful for this post so that I can see others are still going, too."
"Trek565665 - That is also the same route we are taking to Hanoi on March 21st.Edited: 1:39 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"The way the virus is spiraling out of control in the USA, Americans may end up on the banned entry list. But Im sure your very stable genius will get it sorted."
"Hi. Are you still going on your trip? We have a flight to Hanoi tomorrow, returning out of Ho CHi Minh CIty on the 28th (taking a 2 week bike tour). We have to make our final decision on whether or not to go today. My fear is that we'll arrive in Hanoi on a flight with others that are diagnosed with Coronavirus and put into quarantine upon arrival. Or, that we get sick while there and put into quarantine. My husband wants to go. I'm on the fence. We have prepaid tours which we will lose if we cancel. So, I hate to cancel unless it's truly warranted."
"I have the absolute same dilemma .. Dont want to reach there , only to be put in some 14 day qurantine"
"We are flying 26th March (from UK) and will go unless flights are cancelled or governments step in. Obviously more concerned with the quarantine being put in place in a street in Hanoi, five minutes from my son’s apartment, but hoping for everyone this will be containable and further quarantine isn’t necessary.Edited: 9:23 am, March 08, 2020 "
"No longer going.Got the airline to waive the cancellation if I moved it, so I'm going in October. This will make it unlikely that I'll get to see green rice fields in Pu Luong like I wanted but can't go in September with my work. I'm also out some nonrefundable things like domestic flights but with the actual flight saved, it could be worse.After the news this morning, where multiple people were quarantined, and all of Cat Ba Island and many Halong Bay cruise ships were shut down for an indeterminate time, I realized that the joy of seeing Vietnam before mass tourism took over wasn't worth the many risks out of my control.I didn't want to be quarantined because one person on my plane was infected, or even me without even knowing it, giving it to some nice old lady in Hoi An unknowingly. I didn't want to wake up every morning to check to make sure my flight or train was still running, that the place I was going was operational, that my hotel was still open and taking foreigners. I don't want to find out that things got worse back home in Canada that would make it difficult to get back, or someone I cared about was isolated due to infection or a city lockdown while I was on a beach somewhere.In other words, as a healthy male, I'm not afraid of the coronavirus, but decided it was not worth being stressed out the whole time when I should be on vacation.To others who decide to go anyways, hope your trip is fun and perfectly safe."
"A Canadian here...I'm in Vietnam now and have had some flight changes imposed and anticipate at least one more. I was in Cambodia and crossed the border yesterday by bus (sort of). The border was a mess. Our bus was told that as a Japanese tourist who visited Siem Reap was found to have the virus, anybody who had been there would be denied entry to Vietnam. Further, there was a list of countries from which nationals would not be admitted. This list was changing but included Germany, France, Ireland, Denmark and several more. All passengers with those passports exited the bus and walked back the Cambodian side to find their own transportation back to Phnom Penh (or faced quarantine). About 10 of us remained, still waiting for information before crossing into Vietnam. Eventually we were told our bus was denied entry and was being turned back to Phnom Penh. A few of us decided to try on our own to cross by foot and we had varying degrees of success. Some people with Seim Reap showing in their documentation were turned back and some weren't. A french woman was denied but another french man cleared. Those of us who made it crossed into Vietnam and flagged down a bus for transport to HCMC. A couple of interesting points to add...the Japanese tourist who had the virus was quarantined and ultimately travelled to HCMC. Further, the land crossing between China and Vietnam is largely open again. A very confusing situation."
Thanks for the update.
"Although we have not cancelled anything - the likely-hood of us going is slim to none now :( the fear of being quarantined once we land or not being let back in the USA will be a nightmare. I also received this email yesterday:Health Alert – U.S. Embassy Hanoi and U.S. Consulate General Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (March 9, 2020) Location: Vietnam Event: There is an ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19), first identified in Wuhan, China. The global public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, with more than 100,000 reported cases worldwide. The Government of Vietnam has implemented enhanced screening to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The government of Vietnam has also quarantined individuals, including Americans, who have come into direct or indirect contact with persons infected with COVID-19 or who have traveled from areas affected by COVID-19. Visit the local government COVID-19 website (in Vietnamese): https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/ for updated information."
We are still planning to go leaving this Friday. Just keeping fingers crossed there are no issues on our flight/entering VN!
Just a warning we arrived from UK yesterday things have changed very swiftly overnight in Hanoi. Tourist sites are closed today ( open yesterday) Signs been put up in shops not to enter without face masks. Others with signs saying no foreigners being served. Everyone has face masks and we are feeling v uneasy as we are being told locals are v scared we bringing the virus with us. It’s not a nice position to be in. So it’s not just about u catching virus here they are v worried posters everywhere. We are waiting to see if our tour going ahead on Thursday. Good luck
"Thank you for the update, Karen. Did you have any trouble at the airport- health screenings/visas ect? Now that you see how things in Hanoi are, would you have still gone?? thanks!"
"@Hen L - I'm flying out from NY to HCMC on Friday with a layover in Taiwan. I already got my visa at the Vietnam Consulate in New York on Monday and arranged with my hotel for the fast track and private car services. However I'm thinking of cancelling due to fear of quarantine. After reading about passengers getting quarantined from being on the same flight as a woman in Hanoi traveling from London as well as a Japanese man from Siem Reap, my fears of going to Vietnam is back. I'm planning on visiting HCMC and Con Dao. The hotel in Con Dao has been difficult about offering a refund. I'm going to get on the phone with them tonight and see what I can do."
"@ready_spagetti I am in the same mindset as you. I was prepared to go on with my trip but, after these new developments, I really don't want to end up quarantined in Vietnam and it seems that many tourist sites are now closing with this new cluster. Additionally, I live in California and I'm not sure we won't soon be considered an ""outbreak area"" and I don't want to unintentionally spread anything around. I was set to depart March 20 and I think I can get most of my $ back. I'm booked on EVA which allows $200 per ticket cancellation so, would be out that cost for sure. If I cancel soon I can recoup a lot of my excursion costs.My decision now is if I want to just straight cancel or try to postpone for September. *Sigh* neither option is ideal."
@LikaKana82 - I too am flying with EVA Air! I was originally supposed to fly with Korean Air but after what happened to Korea I changed my flight to EVA. All seemed to be going well but ugh things are changing rapidity and now I’m back to square one. I’m going contact my hotel in Con Dao to see what my options are then make a final decision tonight as I’m supposed to fly out Thursday night!!
"I just talked to my husband and we've decided to try and change our dates to September/October. Hopefully, we will not lose so much $ this way and hopefully things will be, if not resolved, a bit more settled by then. good luck with the hotel!"
