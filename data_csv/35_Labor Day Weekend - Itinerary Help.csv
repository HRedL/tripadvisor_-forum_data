"Based on current travel conditions, I'm cancelling a trip to Vegas/Grand Canyon/Death Valley and hoping to replace it with a trip to Canyonlands/Arches/Capitol Reef. I was in Bryce and Zion last year and fell in love with the area. Flights into Moab are quite reasonable right now, so hoping to fit in a packed itinerary. I'm a solo traveler, young, and experienced with long hikes in the heat. I just started a new job and ideally would like to hold off on using time off, but am curious if this is too ambitions an itinerary. Please let me know and I can add a day. Other feedback on hotel suggestions and avoiding crowds are appreciated!Day 1: fly into Moab (1pm)Day 2: ArchesDay 3: CanyonlandsDay 4: drive to Capitol Reef, stay in TorreyDay 5: fly out of Moab (4pm)Ideally I'd like to do a morning hike at each park early to beat the crowds and heat, and then a shorter afternoon trek with stargazing at night. I'll gladly add a day for a second one at Arches if folks feel that's necessary, but did spend a week at Zion and Bryce last fall."
"Perhaps you could hold off your trip until there is a proven and safe COVID-19 vaccine and early stage COVID-19 therapeutics. COVID-19 cases are currently rising in many areas of the USA - not sure what Labor Day will bring?Edited: 9:18 pm, July 09, 2020 "
"Welcome to the Utah forums. Wisconsin native myself. Go Packers. A few thoughts for you.Given the number of days you have, I would stick with Moab. There's so much to see and do - in the national parks and beyond - that you can save yourself six hours of driving and use it more efficiently around Moab.Yes, there will be crowds. We're seeing record crowds in national parks and national forest areas so far this summer with everyone trying to get out of the cities and into the backcountry. Arches will be very busy. Canyonlands Island in the Sky and Dead Horse a bit less. Canyonlands Needles less again. Also look at areas like Fisher Towers, shaded hikes like Grandstaff Canyon.If you really want to go to Capitol Reef, your noted plan will work. But it's really aggressive - especially if you are driving three hours there and then three hours back to fly back.On your flights, do the math to see if there's really a benefit flying into Moab. From Green Bay, that's likely going to be three flights. If you're just going to Moab, it probably makes sense. But if you go to Torrey, you may well be better off flying to Salt Lake City.Have fun."
"Thanks all - understand there will be crowds, was at RMNP last labor day. I typically start hikes before sunrise, so think that will help. I'm flying out of Madison and only have a quick layover in Denver - was shocked how easy it is to fly into Moab!I'll plan on adding a sixth day - I think a second day in Arches makes sense? Currently looking at the Super 8 and Big Horn Lodge for hotels."
"It looks like they are taking reservations for the Fiery Furnace now! It has been closed since the parks closed. I have never been there, but it's definitely on my list of things I absolutely want to do. It says that ranger led tours are being offered, but won't issue single permits until the visitor center opens. Have fun!!"
"If your one day in Canyonlands is Island in the Sky,I would recommend The Needles for your added day."
"I'll second Needles for your added day. Super 8 or Big Horn are fine. We used to use Super 8 a lot but haven't stayed there in 20+ years. It's expanded a lot. It's on the north side of town so access to the parks doesn't involve going through the heart of town. It's a bit of a distance to town itself. There are a few restaurants in walking distance if you count Denny's. Big Horn is an older motel but fine. It's on the south side of town. Again, a few restaurants in walking distance. It's a bit more walkable to center of town, but long walk. You would have to go through heart of town getting to the parks. If you're up early, that won't be any issue.Have fun."
"Thanks for the feedback! I think the north side makes more sense to avoid traffic - quick drive into town, won't be having too many beers with early morning hikes and the heat!!"
"I would definitely stay at the Comfort Suites- Moab, even if it's a few dollars more. It's updated and nice also offers free breakfast, gym, hot tub and pool if that matters to you and if those facilities are even open. It's still a good central location.I would limit your visit to Moab and nearby. Canyonlands alone is over 300 acres. One day for Arches is plenty. I've been to Moab many times over several years and still haven't seen 1/3 of it. We also rent off-road UTV's and explore a lot. To me anyway, that is the real Moab. The parks are nice (touristy), but if you really want to feel small, and appreciate Moab, get out into the canyons and enjoy. Moab Tour Company can take you on a tour of Hell's Revenge. You will remember this. You can hike Morning Glory Arch every day- nearby on Rt. 128. You can drive to Green River (if you have a rental- get a 4x4) and explore Little Wildhorse Canyon. If you have a 4x4, I would drive from town, to Potash Rd., to the Shafer Trail up to Dead Horse Point. You can get out and hike a bit as well- great views. This too will be memorable and not something everyone does. Quick tips: Never drive too close to the edge of the cliffs- it will look dry but underneath, it can be wet mud so your truck can continue forward. Bring at least 1 gallon of water (Camelback/Hydro(back)packs are great), snacks, a hat on outings and plenty of fuel. The guidebook- Guide to Moab UT Backroads & 4... 3rd edition is great resource to have. A handheld GPS unit would also help. Have fun!"
