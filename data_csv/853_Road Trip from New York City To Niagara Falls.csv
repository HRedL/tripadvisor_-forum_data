"I am doing a road trip from New York City To Niagara Falls, is there anything worth stopping by? I have all day long, I am not in rush to get to the falls.Thank you in advance"
You could consider Finger Lakes if you have a day.
"When will you be making this trip? Middle of AprilHow many days have you planned for this trip? Day and a half for the drive and several days for the fallsDo your plans include visiting the Canadian side? Yes, I am planning to visit the Canadian side as well.@BangkokSachse great advice, thank you very much"
"Assuming you can still get into NYC from abroad, be sure to check that any activities you plan to do at the falls or on the way there are not impacted by COVID-19.An example is the Corning Museum of Glass which is currently closed until April 12 and I imagine that date is subject to the state of the pandemic at that time.Safe travels if you make the trip!Edited: 12:57 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Many things have changed in the US in just the last few days. There are many cancellations and closings as we're just starting to see Covid here in the US. It's very likely that you won't even be allowed to arrive in the US. Please keep on top of this.
It also just occurred to me that there are likely COVID-19 restrictions for getting across the border into Canada that could impact you.
Please cancel your trip. Now is not the best time for international travels.
"Sorry, I forgot to mention, I didn't changed my city on my profile. I am USA citizen and living in Houston for the past decade."
It is still not a good time to travel. Stay home and enjoy Houston.
"Regardless of your US citizenship and Houston residency, as I stated on the parallel inquiry that you've posted on the NY Forum, this is not the time to be taking a road trip far from home. That situation will not have improved over the next 3-4 weeks; indeed, it could be worse.Edited: 2:28 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"MBA, I created a new thread regarding a trip from WI to FL in 6 weeks, and you have given me more to think about, thanks. (I won't re-hash the background here.) I'll mention my personal opinion. I didn't enjoy Niagara Falls. Yes, I know that's blasphemy, but of all the places I've seen in the US, I'd put that into the end of my top 150. Does that help?"
"Frozen Tundra, we too were underwhelmed by N Falls -- granted we only viewed them from the US side, as part of a brief stop on the way home driving from VT.As your current dilemma, since it's a road trip, you may be able to delay your decision. As a predictive matter, I'd be doubtful that the situation will have improved to the point that you would want to make this trip. I understand how you feel. I've got a trip planned for early April to see my very elderly mother. The odds that I will go are probably zero. But I can wait until the last minute to cancel all of my reservations, without any penalty, so I have not yet cancelled those bookings."
"Darn, they DO need to get a LIKE button here, don't they? I just wrote that in a way I'm lucky that it's 6 weeks out, but then we'll have a much better handle on how it's being dealt with. A definite go or no-go, will probably be clear in a few weeks."
"I will monitor the situation and play it by ear. Of course the health and safety is number one, if the situation doesn't clear completely I won't risk my life and the life of others just for a trip. I will wait for now and cancel if I need to towards the end, I also have free cancellation policy, but regardless, safety is number one.Thank you all for the responses, I truly appreciate."
"Kosta, I think this answer will be made for you. In the last few hours a more serious tone is taking in recommendations. It's likely none of us will be traveling for a while."
