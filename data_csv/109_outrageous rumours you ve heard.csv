"That young people won't get the virus badly.The worst idea from the beginning that seems to have stuck with disasterous results for all ages.Anything funny? Nope. Very short of funny at the mo, could do with a lot of it right now."
"How about Coronavirus can't survive above 27C, that was spread about by some people, some with vested interests."
I heard a rumour that Lord Lucan is alive and he is self isolating with Elvis :)
Elvis?! I thought he was with Jim Morrison!
Thats what people thought but it was a rumour hes with Lucan well thats what I heard :)
"That the world isn't round & don't say that is not true because it was the President of the USA, the Donald, that said it"

That Joe Biden has all his marbles.
"No you've got it wrong, Elvis is isolating with Jimmy Hoffa and Sally Spectra."
I heard that if you eat a couple of Tide Pods and wash them down with hand sanitizer it makes you immune from the virus. ;)
That the orange man does.
"According to the news, there apparently is a rumour on social media in the UK that the 5G towers either are spreading corona virus or make people vulnerable to it. I think the (ill) logic is that the Chinese company Huwei is involved in a peripheral way with the 5G roll out.Some idiots have been setting fire to the 5G towers.I blame the English educational system for not teaching basic critical thinking.On the other hand, two people died in a western state because the ate some aquarium treatment that contained some chemical the Donald Trump had said would cure/prevent corona virus. Trump's family have invested in a company that makes the chemical he recommended, althought not the aquarium treatment.Edited: 2:03 pm, April 13, 2020 "

I heard you can catch it by standing in your front window naked and licking the glass.
"That the Man from Del Monte, he said No!"
"Wow. A lot of stage 4 Trump Derangement Syndrome on display. I heard that TDS suppresses one’s immune system. Another four years of orange man bad and it’s going to get awfully tiring. Stay safe, self isolate and remember to social distance but don’t remove your seat belts. ;)"

@33 - Pete Evans is definitely in the lead pack in the competition to be the worst person in Australia. And he has been for several years: this isn't his first venture into dangerous lunacy.
"I would mostly head in the opposite direction to whatever Pete Evans suggests. He's had a lot of silly things, the most mild being his 'activated almonds', which turned out to be almonds soaked in water! ??? I remember a few years back he was big on promoting the 'Caveman's Diet', or some similar name. You know, only eating things you could gather and such. I was at a 'Better Homes and Gardens' expo, and heard someone ask one of their celebrity cooks/chefs what he thought about it, and the answer was 'remember that cavemen only lived to about 30 years old, too.' Loved that!Looking at rumours just about Covid-19- it's sad and horrible that idiots start them spreading. There are always people desperate enough to give something a try. :(Keep up the silly ones, though!! :)"
You Ozzies are funny bears Centralvic. Luv ya !
"You think that's funny, Walker E? You should hear some of the jokes I couldn't put up on the forum!!"
"Pete Evans should be locked up for the nonsense he sprouts.He is an avowed anti vaxxer too, so presumably won't require a vaccine when it is available."
I read that re-posters are contagious.

I heard someone say Donald Trump is President of the US but that's just too ridiculous.
"I heard there was a vaccine for Trump Derangement Delusion syndrome. An ongoing mental, evidently chronic condition where ones hatred of our great President has led them to go insane and abandon all logic and reason in a paranoid frenzy. This syndrome has spread beyond the U.S borders it seems."
& that vaccine is called hydroxychloroquine
"^^^^Another good idea of the Trump administration as evidenced by Trumps meeting with COVID survivors yesterday in The White House. At least two survivors were at deaths door before taking Hydroxychloroquine combined with Z pack. Thank you for bringing that up.Edited: 11:13 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Trump is Deranged and Delusional ? Wait that isn't a rumour, it's fact ! lol"
What is TDS?
I heard that Ronald McDonald is actually the King of Burger King and a McRib is the cure.
TDS - Trump Derangement Syndrome is a debilitating psychological condition that predominantly afflicts those who cannot accept the 2016 election of President Trump. Those suffering cannot accept anything Trump does regardless of merit. It’s sort of a pandemic of its own. Similar to the COVID 19 there is no current cure. Prognosis: Sad.
"Oh, so different to TDDS, seems wherever you read Trump, deranged usually follows"
"I overheard someone saying ""This is COVID-19, not COVID-1 folks, and so you would think the people in charge... would be on top of that.""People actually believe this to be the 19th iteration of the virus, as if it's named like a movie franchise."
"TDS = Trump is Deranged Syndrome.., He and all his loyal trumpets suffer from it."
"COVID-19, starring Tom Cruise..."
#57- Sorry for your disease stricken situation. Confusion is one of the symptoms to attack the nervous system. Lol!Be well.
Godzilla vs. Covid-19 II coming soon.
"Just a sobering reminder that the old maxim that, 'Truth is the first casualty of war' is bang-on. See some of the corona nonsense that uneducated folks believed just recently in India. Note also that during the AIDS crisis, some South Africans believed that sleeping with virgins would cure those afflicted. When I asked the stately Principal at one of the Zulu hinterland schools that my wife and I toured about that rumour (no pun intended), he hung his head then mumbled that sadly, it was true. Bush doctors continue to have their client base, and some of the latter will believe just about anything that those doctors say. I am done. the end."
"#56, “I overheard someone saying ""This is COVID-19, not COVID-1 folks, and so you would think the people in charge... would be on top of that."" It was actually, “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks. You would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that.”, said today or yesterday by Kellyanne Conway, the advisor to Trump who also brought us the term, “alternative facts”."
"@56 / 62 - Oh, God. I thought you might have made this up: sometimes someone in the Trump Administration is reported as having said something so stupid that it can't possibly be real. And they are vulnerable to people making false claims that they've said really, really stupid things, because they have a track record of saying really stupid things. But no, you didn't make this up. Do you think this might be the ""dead cat strategy""? That's where you say something completely outrageous to distract from the stupid or awful thing you have said or done. By saying this - something absolutely, profoundly ridiculous - she's distracting from the appalling move to defund the WHO. And she may be successful. ----""Alternative facts"" are interesting. In the 1980s and 1990s in China, the government would lie about stuff, not to fool people into thinking that what they said was true, but on the assumption that people would know they were lying. The point of this - and I've heard it from several friends who were involved in propaganda in China at the time - was an expression of power. One said, ""What we're doing is saying, 'We define what is true, not you. What you see with your own eyes is not the truth. The truth is what we tell you is the truth. Where there is contradiction between what you see or know and what we tell you, what we tell you is the truth. That is how powerful we are. We define reality.'"" From the inauguration crowd alternative facts onward, I've suspected that this is a significant part of the White House's strategy."
"63, you are right. They say outrageous things, horrifying people, the media covers it, while the administration then quietly does away with protections like auto fuel efficiency rules. They use diversions all the time. They also propose doing outrageous things, like today threatening to adjourn Congress which has never been done in the history of the US. He will back down, but he will do something in the meantime while everyone is distracted. It’s political “Gaslighting”, and they are good at it."
"Wow. I see this thread has degenerated into full blown stage four Trump Derangement Syndrome. I’m Canadian so I’ve got no horse in the race but I just can’t understand the anti Trumpers. He’s your president. Live with it. Come up with a better option and people will elect your candidate. If Joe Biden is that guy then run with it. If you lose again in November then come up with a better plan. In the meantime, shut up about it. We are not all American and we just don’t care ! (Just kidding ! Well, not really !)Hugs & stuff, Walker"
"If it's a thread about outrageous rumours, he really is the elephant in the room. And he does affect the rest of us, unfortunately."
Curious Bruce. Who is the elephant in the room ? The PM of Australia ? Scotty ? Say it ain’t so !!!
"No, Scotty From Marketing is the mediocrity in the room. Becoming an elephant is far beyond his aspirations. What I'm saying is that you can't have a thread about outrageous rumours without the world's leading exponent of unfounded nonsense getting the occasional mention. To be specific, that is Trump. And his unfounded rumours - like the hilarious one about how the WHO somehow kept the coronavirus secret from America and that that's why America was unprepared for the outbreak, and that the WHO should therefore be defunded - affect all of us. This isn't a ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" thing: when there is a daily lying-to-the-media session at the White House, and when those lies cause people to die, there really is no derangement among the people who disapprove. Like it or not, any US President's decisions affect us all, and at the moment we're in a position where we're all having to deal with someone who has absolutely no concept of truth. I'd have preferred it if this thread were more about outrageous rumours of the Richard Gere variety, but at the moment you really can't ignore Trump, much as I'm sure many of us would love to.Edited: 12:02 am, April 16, 2020 "

"OK with a view of trying to make this thread on topic about COVID_19GarlicLots of posts that recommend eating garlic to prevent infection are being shared on Facebook.The WHO (World Health Organization) says that while it is ""a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties"", there's no evidence that eating garlic can protect people from the new coronavirus.In lots of cases, these kinds of remedies aren't harmful in themselves, as long as they aren't preventing you from following evidence-based medical advice. But they have the potential to be.The South China Morning Post reported a story of a woman who had to receive hospital treatment for a severely inflamed throat after consuming 1.5kg of raw garlic.We know, in general, that eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water can be good for staying healthy. However, there is no evidence specific foods will help fight this particular virus.What other myths / rumours have you heard?"
"Hair dryers can kill the novel coronavirus“People are thinking hot air kills this virus and are using blow dryers or somehow increasing the room temperature to help prevent the spread, but that will not happen,Spray alcohol and chlorine all over your bodySpraying alcohol all over your body can be harmful, particularly to your eyes and mouth. Importantly, the alcohol in the sanitiser is not the same as the alcohol that people drink."
"I have read about high strength alcohol, vitamin c & vitamin d, all it seems have not been proven to be effective"

"Drinking water every 15 minutesOne post, copied and pasted by multiple Facebook accounts, quotes a ""Japanese doctor"" who recommends drinking water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus that might have entered the mouth. A version in Arabic has been shared more than 250,000 times.Professor Trudie Lang at the University of Oxford says there is ""no biological mechanism"" that would support the idea that you can just wash a respiratory virus down into your stomach and kill it.Infections like coronaviruses enter the body via the respiratory tract when you breathe in. Some of them might go into your mouth, but even constantly drinking water isn't going to prevent you from catching the virus.Nonetheless, drinking water and staying hydrated is generally good medical advice."

"Heat and avoiding ice creamThere are lots of variations of the advice suggesting heat kills the virus, from recommending drinking hot water to taking hot baths, or using hairdryers.One post, copied and pasted by dozens of social media users in different countries - and falsely attributed to Unicef - claims that drinking hot water and exposure to the sun will kill the virus, and says ice cream is to be avoided."

It is under siege!""Please explain his swings between it being his authority alone, to it is not his authority to re-open, to encouraging residents of (states with Democratic governors) to protest.Extra points for answering why no ""LIBERATE MISSISSIPPI"" when (Republican) governor extended a stay-at-home order this morning.Extra points for explaining why, on March 6th, Trump said ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test.

Someone is having a full blown TDS attack this morning. Four more years. What will you do. I watched a clip of the flowerpot men. It’s seems Trudeau might actually be the effeminate weed in the middle of the pots that plays a rather irrelevant role.
"Umm, I was referring to the scary alcohol situation. I would be terrified of running out of booze."
"""Four more years. What will you do."">. Just continue doing what I have been, which is feeling very sorry for those living under Trump's rule. And I'm not having a TDS attack ... I think it's hilarious that people use that phrase to deflect any criticism of Trump, because they can't think of an intelligent way to defend his actions."
"TDS is a real psychological affliction. You can easily identify people who’ve got it. 1. It doesn’t matter what subject you are discussing, they will always find a way to inject Trump as a kind of test to see if you hate Trump as much as they do. 2. If you don’t identify yourself as a Trump hater they go into fight or flight response. Either they will shout at you telling you how backwards and stupid you are for supporting Trump...or simply walk away and leave you standing there wondering what happened. I’m not even American but I’ve experienced that several times. Once I was sitting on a bench with my cousin and she did #1. I said something noncommittal like ‘he’s not my president.’ I didn’t give her the ‘orange man bad’ response she was looking for so she abruptly got up and stomped off, leaving her purse under the park bench. I got it for her. Six months later she split with her husband of 30 years and now doesn’t watch the news at all. Probably a good thing.Edited: 11:41 am, April 18, 2020 "
Heard this one last night - recent statistics show a disparity between the races (DNA) in CV19 deaths to indicate the highest number of fatalities are in people’s of African decent and the least affected racial group is Asians. Makes sense for a made in China pandemic. The report further suggested this tailor-made designer virus would rid the world of many “undesirables“.
"Kitty -that really inflames me. If people choose to opt out of the recommended safety precautions for stupid political reasons they should also be exempted from CV19 hospitalizations and medical treatments, PPE, ventilators, etc and NOT save them for people who were not merely careless, but egregiously placing themselves in harms way, and maybe my family.They have the right to make that choice, I suggest it comes with a price tag.

Here is a potentially horrific & unforeseen circumstance of this crisis…sky.com/story/coronavirus-one-thousand-thai…
"Tru story:I was at our gym about 5 weeks ago, and had a brief chat with a seemingly unhinged fellow club member. He was ranting on and on about how the virus was a conspiracy and had been patented years ago etc etc. Thing is, the speaker was a PROMINENT NEWS ANCHOR FOR ONE OF OUR MORE HIGH-PROFILE TV STATIONS!!! I almost steered him off to one corner with a 'there there.'Poor guy seemed to have no sense at all at just how inappropriate his spiel had been then, let alone towards a complete stranger like myself, and how vulnerable he'd made himself if I'd been the sort to contact his employers with a revealing description of the rant. I was stunned and just kept nodding my head. Wow.I am done. the end.Edited: 1:14 pm, April 18, 2020 "
"<""TDS is a real psychological affliction."">According to which medical association? I think it's just a made up term, and those who support Trump believe it's real. <""It doesn’t matter what subject you are discussing, they will always find a way to inject Trump as a kind of test to see if you hate Trump as much as they do."">The reverse is true too ... Trump supporters will change the subject to test you with a negative comment about the Democrats. I had it happen a couple of weeks ago and didn't bite."
"Well Susan, TDS hasn’t been around long enough for double blind studies etc so it’s not an official ‘thing’ yet. So you have one testimonial saying the opposite. I have had many experiences with TDS. I NEVER bring up Trump in ANY conversation (for obvious reasons: I don’t like getting screamed at) but others almost always bring up Trump like for example, this thread. You just have to watch CNN, MSNBC or read the NYT, The Hill or Washington post and it’s full on TDS. I’m not sure what it is that drives Democrats so insane over Trump. They used to be way more rational but now it’s just get Trump 24/7. It’s almost funny to watch from north of the border."
Trump is very funny to watch here in the UK as well and gets lampooned on any TV shows here many times with recorded footage to back up their commentsThe man is a JOKE and hopefully his handling of the pandemic will see the end of him
"<"" I’m not sure what it is that drives Democrats so insane over Trump."">It's Trump himself that causes it ... and it's not just the Democrats that he stirs up - it's people within his own party, medical authorities, etc. I don't bring him up in conversations either ... it's not worth it."
"Meanwhile, back on topic…sky.com/story/coronavirus-church-ordered-to…"
"Sorry, Gaildorr, I wrote this back in reply to the comment before you. I had the honor in April 2016 of being the veritable “fly on the wall” at a meeting of university professors, former senators and diplomats on the topic of relations between the US and China under the “next” presidential administration. At dinner I sat at a table with professors and the late Jim Lehrer (Anchor for years for his news show on US Public Television) and his wife. The topic discussed at the table was unfortunately all Trump. He had yet to win a primary I believe. Because he was so obviously not just unqualified but bore the traits that prevented immoral people like him from being nominated for office, they all dismissed him. Except Jim Lehrer’s wife who understood his populist appeal to the masses of people who believed he understood their needs and that the Democrats, especially the polarizing Hillary Clinton, did not. His nomination and then election was truly not expected by those who abhorred him as a person, and his machinations upon election that have shaken national and world institutions have devastated many. But unlike any predecessor, he has been impervious to any action against him because he has rewarded hypocrites, who protect him, by giving them what they want and because he personally has no concept of shame, no conscience, never admits error, never accepts responsibility but takes all credit, strikes back at any disloyalty with very effective school yard bully name calling. He knows what hurts people, where they are weak, and is happy to publicly expose those weaknesses. He will throw friends “under the bus” but expects total loyalty. Things that any other politician would have been embarrassed out of office for. He’s the laughing stock of the world but even as they make jokes behind his backs, other world leaders don’t stand up to him. This next election is going to be difficult. His likely opponent clearly has age related mental lapses. I can’t imagine what will happen in a debate. God help us.Edited: 3:52 pm, April 18, 2020 "
"@PassionforEire....”God help us.” The Trump Derangement Syndrome is alive and well. Here’s the thing. People with TDS cannot name one single good thing that Trump has done. A sure sign. And when asked to name just one lie that Trump has said they say that there’s just too many to choose from. Donald Trump has been attacked and mocked from all sides since he wasn’t even the nominee. I still remember them at CNN with tears streaming down their faces laughing because like Trump has no chance, right ?! Then when he went up against Hillary they said his chances of getting elected were about 2%. Then when he became president there as an explosion of outrage and anger that Hillary won the popular vote (irrelevant) and that Russia had somehow stolen the election. Ever since then anyone who supported or voted for Trump has been called a deplorable, a mysogynist, a bigot, a racist, antisemitic, a white supremist, a Nazi......I mean it just goes on and on nonstop and that’s directed at close to half of the American population. Now that’s deranged. I will agree that Trump is not a typical president and doesn’t fall easily within the Democratic or Republican camps. That’s a good thing. Both parties need a shakeup and Trump is doing that in spades. He’s a deal maker and has been for decades before his debut in reality shows.  I hope you TDS sufferers will make it through another four years of Trump because that’s what it’s looking like at this point."
"Walker, I don’t have TDS. I was just elaborating, a lot, on Susan’s comment. I don’t see any good outcome in 2020, anymore than I did in 2016. Hence, God help us. Trump is destructive, a liar, and all I said and more. He’s disgusting and he’s accomplished raising the national debt, diminishing the military, and has tried unsuccessfully with our enemies, like his good pals Kim Jung-Un and Vladimir Putin. He’s not a conservative, and conservatives who know that but support him have betrayed their principles."
"One last thing. Economics is going to be a huge problem. It can’t be ignored. In the US it’s going to be bad. I have to believe that will be the case in lots of countries. In the last day I’ve seen reports indicating the virus’ impact on our health care system is reducing since major hospitals are allowing elective surgeries again. As the health impact on the virus wanes, More stories like this headline from the Washington Post, will be all over the place about how the impact of the virus will be paid for. In the US, I have no trust in any leaders to handle this, and I have doubts about many countries. Like I said, God help us. Maybe Trump can get the Chinese to pay for it like he got Mexico to pay for his wall. “Record government, corporate debt could lead to ‘tipping point’ after pandemic passes“ -The federal government is on its way this year to spending $4 trillion more than it collects in revenue, analysts say. The reliance on so much debt will leave scars after the pandemic passes, economists say, making it difficult for policymakers to withdraw support and leaving the economy more vulnerable than before this crisis began.Edited: 7:19 pm, April 18, 2020 "
"Walker #151. Well said. As the democrats, Trump haters, and other bitter malcontents continue with their psychotic rage Trump met with faith leaders to bring people together. We can also be thankful that Trump is a great businessman and have confidence our economy will recover with him at the helm. My business increased 37% in his first year as President alone. As for lies the democrats continue to accuse Trump of precisely what they themselves are guilty of. I honestly can’t think of a single time Trump has lied. Actually he has made some pretty big promises and claims but he has lived up to all of them. I cannot think of one campaign promise that interested me that he has not fulfilled or is in the process of doing so. Once Trump is re elected I think at the very least the TDS sufferers will all have to get a therapy dog or some other creature of choice. They will go bat crazy.This thread reminds me of what the alternative is if Trump and Republicans in our country were outnumbered and inspired me to give the largest donation I’ve ever given to the RNC when they called today.So thanks guys and the RNC thanks you as well.Edited: 7:44 am, April 19, 2020 "
"I wish I could’ve read #155.“ Trump continues with racist and misogynistic behaviour, berates his fellow American politicians by engaging in childish name calling, and is seen by many as a bully and a selfish, egocentric tyrant.”. Piratepirate There you go again. TDS...it’s as least as bad as COVID-19."
"I’ll try again.Well said Walker. While democrats, Trump haters, and other bitter malcontents continue their psychotic rage Trump meets with faith leaders to bring people together and solve problems. The great businessman that Trump is we have confidence he will recover our economy. My business increased 37% in Trumps first year alone. As for lies the Democrats continue to accuse Trump of precisely what they are guilty of. I honestly cannot think of a single lie that President Trump has told. Sure he makes promises and big claims but he sees them through. Every campaign promise that I’m interested in he has fulfilled. Once Trump is re elected I believe TDS sufferers will have to invest in a therapy dog or some other creature of choice. They will go bat crazy. This thread reminds me of what would be if the Republicans were not in full control so when the RNC called (good timing on their part), I gave the largest donation I could. So thanks guys and the RNC thanks you as well."
"Walker you left out the Phobias they call Trump supporters. . Homophobia, xenophobic, the list is endless snowflake nonsense. We are all phobes LOL!Where are the real comedians?"
"Kat51Ky, You missed my post #118, I've reposted. Help me understand the following few points.Earlier this week, Trump said he had ""absolute authority"" to re-open businesses across the county. Yesterday, he said the governors of each state ""call the shots"" on when to re-open their states (the federal guidelines to ""re-open"" the country make sense and closely mirror what many governors have been saying). Today, moments after a Fox News Channel story on protests against stay-at-home orders issued by MN / MI / VA governor, Trump tweeted ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA"" ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" and ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!"" These tweets seem contradictory given his comments Thursday.Please explain his swings between it being his authority alone, to it is not his authority to re-open, to encouraging residents of (states with Democratic governors) to protest.Extra points for answering why no ""LIBERATE MISSISSIPPI"" when (Republican) governor extended a stay-at-home order this morning.Extra points for explaining why, on March 6th, Trump said ""Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what the bottom line is."" But today tweeted: ""The States have to step up their TESTING!"" Oh, and by the way, there is one of Mr Trump's lies.I don't have TDS, I'm just disappointed in the Republican party for abandoning their principles. Spending under the Trump administration, along with the 2017 tax cuts, have increased the federal deficit substantially, far more than under the previous administration (maybe not actions taken in 2008-2009 during the last recession).And clearly the deficit is going to blow up worse due to the (100% necessary) stimulus spending due to COVID-19 pandemic. But I digress...."
Oh no question you do have TDS. I cannot reason with you.  Not worth it. You are too far gone.
"If anyone is interested, on his BBC show now showing, Andrew Marr is going to be interviewing the lead scientist from the Oxford University team that think they are close to a virus."

"Both sides of my family have been in America since the 17th century. My grandmother belonged and my daughter belongs to the DAR. I have always felt a great pride in what America wanted to be, even when it fell short in the reality.I now understand what it must feel like to carry a passport from a country internationally known to be corrupt (will somebody please tell me what qualifications Trump's children and son in law have to advise anyone? And what head of a democratic country says that an unproven drug made by a company his family invests in is a cure for an illness killing thousands of his own people?), a country with a stupid crazy man at its head. A man whose grandfather was an immigrant, who marries immigrants but demonises immigrants? A man who uses his political platform to enrich himself. Trump does make me feel deranged as I see the country I love become an international laughing stock and a source of fear. I can hardly bear to watch the news.There certainly have been presidents I haven't voted for in the many elections held since I was 21 but none have made me so angry and so ashamed.I get that there are people who feel that they have been ignored by successive US governments. What I don't get is how they can ignore the contradictions in Trump's various pronouncements and not, now, see him for what he is."
After watching DT on the news today I wondered if the rumour that he is related to the Spectacled Bear could be true. Bright orange face except for white spectacles around the eyes.Does he have any other white bits?
"Why, after three years in office, is Trump blaming Obama's administration for the lack of masks and for faulty COVID 19 test kits? Both of those issues occurred under Trump's rule. Who does he think he's fooling by trying to pass off blame that clearly falls on him?"
The left accuses Trump of exactly what they themselves are guilty of. Case in point lies in the one #166. Where is your evidence that Trump has investments in your said drug? That is beyond outrageous. He’s actually trying to help people unlike the previous administration that we had to endure for 8 long years. You are obviously listening to cnn - communism news network whose ratings are at rock bottom in this country. One “anti Trump bombshell “ after the other that never proved to be factual. Where’s the Russian collusion. Judge Cavanaugh fiasco was a real doozy etc. They are not journalists but rather a wing of the Democrat party. Talk about clowns. As others continue their meltdown Trump works tirelessly on behalf of the American people and we are very fortunate and proud to have him as our President. Best President in my lifetime. Maybe ever. As for a vaccine I too hope those at Oxford university find a vaccine for the virus but quickly follow up please with one for the deranged TDS folks. At least someone finally admitted it. That’s a good first step.
"Well Susan that explanation is very easy. Obama let our stockpile of PPE expire and get depleted. Obama did nothing to prepare for a pandemic. Very similar to what he did to our military. Shameful. Thank God we have President Trump. We are very proud of him and lucky to have him.Edited: 9:07 am, April 19, 2020 "
"Well here is irony, if ever I've seen ithttps:/…"
The good thing about Agent Orange and the other tangerines is they produce a lot of good resources for laughter.
Fruitcakes and fruit loops are hilarious as well. Some fruitcakes are nuttier than others.
Nothing new in latest Government blaming the previous one.We get it all the time.Labour will say that our NHS has been allowed to run down for 25 years but during that time they were also in Government and did nothing to stop the rot.When this is all over many Governments including the UK will need to look at the necessity of having a big stockpile of PPE to get out when it needs it
"<""Obama let our stockpile of PPE expire and get depleted."">Trump had 3+ years to correct that - but he chose not to."
"I heard a rumour that they are going to have those crazy rallies in the US.I think that is hilarious, dangerous but hilarious."
"I will try not to mention Donald Trump again because it sends some people into paroxysms of anger and there really is no cure for stage 4 TDS. I was just responding to the smattering of anti Trump sentiments that were showing up in some posts. No need for politics here. Take Trump seriously but not literally. He’s an expert negotiator and deal maker. He believes that engaging someone like Kim Jong Un through diplomacy will be more rewarding in the long run than threats or military action. Time will tell. Whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican you should wish the president the best whether you like him or not. It seems awfully counterproductive to wish him failure. In the end Trump will go down in history as one of the best, most effective presidents or something less than that. As I said, I’m Canadian and have no horse in the race. That’s it for me. I’m done."
"Regarding post #161 (in response to my #160 and #118).""Oh no question you do have TDS. I cannot reason with you. Not worth it. You are too far gone.""What makes you say I'm ""too far gone?"" Everything I posted were facts, direct quotes from Trump in White House published transcripts or from his Twitter feed. I admit the phrasing ""Extra credit for..."" was not neutral.Objectively, his statement from over a month ago saying everyone could get a test that wants one was false at that time. It is widely acknowledged that even as of this date, the US does not have the ability to fully test its population for the virus.Regarding my comments on the deficit, here's a link to an editorial from The Hill, which is right-center (so hardly snowflake, lib, lame-stream media), which lays out the facts behind my statement regarding spending: https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/438058-b…The increase in the deficit due to policies and spending which took place in a Republican controlled House and Senate, and Republican president, is also a fact. How does stating that make me ""too far gone"" or one who cannot be reasoned with? So, again, anyone, help me understand. I've love to hear an explanation for the above, instead of a dismissal.I also realize this forum and pretty much any social media site is hardly the right forum for rational discussion (""Not worth it"" is a great summary actually!), but I'm doing laundry and waiting for the dryer to finish...so figured I'd post.#177, I agree with your ""Time will tell"" statement. Jury is still well out regarding his approach to North Korea, and administratin in general. The ""seriously not literally"" comment echoes what's been said before about his approach."
"Well said Walker. Time and time again Obama took from the stockpile over multiple crises during his awful administration. First H1N1 then several hurricanes, a severe flood, next Ebola, next botulism outbreak and lastly Zika virus. With each of these crises they took and took and never replenished. Then sadly and corruptly they never informed the incoming Trump administration of this negligence. Just like the military. Trump was shocked as the rest of us were. Travelynme Do you mean crazy Joe Biden rallies? He can’t put three sentences together coherently. He has TDS but also some other condition that has deminished his mental capacity.  It can’t be a rally if no more than 50 people show up."
I just think all the rallies and protests in the US are crazy. I think you cannot maintain physical distancing.When I see the news and all those protests about opening up for business I am amazed that things like that are going on. It makes me feel very sad.
Very much agree with you about the liberate rallies - total madness

"That’s hilarious chi_dave. Who’s checking the fact checkers ? All three of those you quoted (especially Snopes) cannot be trusted.

"<""What makes you say I'm ""too far gone?"">She's not happy about what's being posted here about Trump and name calling is one way to deal with it?"
"“Who’s checking the fact checkers ? All three of those you quoted (especially Snopes) cannot be trusted.”And how do we know that the sources which make that claim can be trusted, lol? We don’t. Which is why it’s pointless to argue politics. Each side has its “trusted” sources, which the other side debunks as fake and not to be trusted. Obviously if you watch Fox and read Town Hall and other conservative media you’ll think everything CNN and MSNBC says is fake, and of course vice versa. Cheers and stay healthy, whichever side you're on!"
"That’s right TNY (or should I say left ). Seems like you need two wings to fly (if you’re a bird.) The two party system in the states is like two one winged birds that can’t fly. I agree with you about politics. Everyone is entrenched in the belief that they are right and everybody else is wrong. I read lots of articles from both leftwing and rightwing publications and it’s pretty easy judging by the source which side of the fence they are going to promote. It’s pretty pathetic actually. The good thing is that the once powerful mainstream news sources are being replaced by a multitude of online news sources, some good and some not so good. Cheers all :)"
"Yes, it'd be great if news sources presented info in a balanced way instead of slanted heavily towards one side. or the other. I think at one time it was that way; maybe I'm wrong. But I think most of us like to self-validate so we seek info only from the side that supports us and ignore or debunk the side that doesn't. Well, whatever, as long as we all get through this with our sanity intact."
"#186, was the ""meltdown"" in reference to #187 where I simply posted some links rebutting your PPE stockpile statements in an earlier post? Hardly a meltdown, just posting a couple links. The ""meltdown"" came from an earlier post who stated that the current administration, which took over in 2017, had 3 years to replenish the stockpile...now that makes no sense! #187,None of the links I posted said the PPE stockpile issue was 100% false or 100% true, they all said it was a mixture...no hysterics there.Anyway, laundry is well finished and so am I.But remember, anyone or anything that disagrees with your beliefs is just part of the conspiracy / cover-up!"
"TNY, at least in the US there has never been balanced news sources. Cities all had newspapers that were slanted and opposed each other and people favored one or the other. But you could discern facts. And could tell when the slant affected news. Hard to do that now. But news and information was never balanced."

A few days ago Trump offered to send them to Russia also. Uh oh!
Trump is sending snorkel masks to Russia?

"Yes Trumps mental deterioration is something to watch, thanks for pointing that out Kat51."
"<""What’s sad is the mental deterioration...."">Instead of attacking people by telling them that they have mental deterioration, TDS, have lost touch with reality (along with many other negative descriptions that you've used in this thread to describe anyone who has a negative comment about Trump), why not present your arguments for what they've said? Post #208 doesn't attack you, but you've attacked that poster. They made two points that you could counter-argue instead of firing off a rant filled with 'name calling'."
I would not expect Kat to counter argue my points.I am sure she/he is too busy stockpiling guns in her/his bunker out the back for when or if the Democrats should win government.BTW it was tragic to hear of another wacko with access to guns who went on a rampage in Nova Scotia. We were there in September and it is a beautiful part of the world which does not deserve this.
Why would Trump send ventilators to Russia? Wouldn't it make more sense to send them to a neighbour who is an ally?
He’s graciously sending ventilators to various countries including allies. Your welcome. This is not the time for narrow mindedness. It appears no one in the Nova Scoria tragedy had a gun to defend themselves. Keep America Great!!
"<""It appears no one in the Nova Scoria tragedy had a gun to defend themselves."">It appears that you don't know the circumstances of that tragedy ... in which case, your thoughts on it are irrelevant.Maybe you could pass the 'narrow mindedness' message on to your president?"

Wow. It was the anti Trumpers on this forum that couldn’t resist inserting Trump. My point #1. You can be discussing the weather or what kind of wine you like and the anti Trumpers will find a way to inject Trump as a kind of test to check whether you hate Trump as much as they do. If you don’t back them up they will either get in your face and start yelling at you or storm off in a huff. So predictable.As for the tragic massacre in Nova Scotia I had to find out from American news that the first two people the shooter killed were his ex and her new boyfriend. Crime of passion. I wonder why they are not reporting that fact in the Canadian media ? Let’s just drop the Trump bashing shall we ? I know some people have to get their daily fix but enough is enough. This is supposed to be a travel forum.

"<""Wow. It was the anti Trumpers on this forum that couldn’t resist inserting Trump.""> Which post was that Walker? I thought it might be mine, but I think I've only 'inserted' his name in response to other posts. And it's not just the anti-Trump posters who are inserting Trump's name ... someone is trying very hard to convince us of things about Trump that the majority of us aren't buying. So perhaps if we are expected to stop bashing Trump, that person could stop being a Trump cheerleader."
"<""I thought you were suffering from boredom ..."">See post #211."
Walker - I’ve noticed the same behavior. As some here in the U.S say ...If Trump invented a cure for cancer they would still have this raging hatred towards him. For example when Trump announced at his conference that he was benevolently sending ventilators to Russia some of the left lost their heads again. I should have never brought it up. I thought is was kind and newsworthy. How will they cope in the future?
"This is neither outrageous nor a rumor, just a fact.As you all continue to bicker, people across the globe continue to die from Covid 19. Everyday folks. Like you and like me.Ponder that...and think about those that they left behind."
I agree Kittygal. We need to be kind and to support one another. This extends to supporting our leaders no matter your party affiliations or political mindset. We are all in this together and need to Stop the negativity and hate mongering. As in Key West they say. We are all one human family. Love Key West.
"Re: this being a ""travel forum"", hardly...while TA's purpose in creating The Layover Lounge was travel related, many threads obviously are related to the situation we all, pretty much world-wide, find ourselves in. Kind of another version of the Off Topic Chatter forum.This thread in particular was started asking about outrageous rumors, so little wonder political views are prevalent. And as is typical of social media, plenty of bashing and less than tactful posts, or outright troll posts. There have been a couple of doozys today!I made a couple posts that sought insight into contradictory comments made by the current USA administration but was told I'm too far gone and not worth responding to. Much easier to lob insults and ignore an earnest request, than to formulate a cogent response, I guess. I didn't really expect a reasoned response, but was hoping for the best."

"Walker E,Why is that post and article a rumour?The trials are happening. It doesn't suggest that we will have a vaccine soon or that it is a foregone conclusion"
"My big brother was an avid Mad magazine fan, and much to his chagrin he had to let me read them. I remember a lot of Nixon Jokes, Gerald Ford jokes and Jimmy Carter jokes.Saturday Night Live used to always start with Chevy Chase as Ford falling over or off of something.Jane Curtin news segment was pretty cutting. What happened, to that audience?"
I also thought it all started in post 12 with the Irish gentleman. Then others jumped on the bandwagon.
"People in the 1970s had a sense of humor, what happened did they all get old or something?"
The current late night hosts are comedians = outrageous rumor. So much hilarious potential comedy material with Bill and Hillary Clinton. And then there’s Adam Shiff! LOL!Jay Leno was one of the last really good late night comedians. Now they don’t exist.

First nation’s person) prince Harry and our wonderful Prime Minister Trudeau are 2 of many examples. As for that article, there is no vaccine. There are many laboratories around the world trying to find one. Let us know when you find one. Did you hear that Djokovic the tennis star has said he’s retiring if they force him to have a vaccine before competing. Not fake news."
Here we go again ^^^ Trump derangement syndrome Stage 3. Mildly entertaining but just sad. Fox news #1 rating in U.S.
Evidently he feels strongly about vaccines. I did too at one time. Until I got the flu a few years ago.

Sure they do.
I agree Kat. We get the flu vaccine every year and haven’t got the flu. That doesn’t mean it worked but hey ! I also know people who don’t get vaccinated. It has to be a choice or what’s next ? An implanted chip ?
"@242 - I didn't realise he was a full-on anti-vaxxer until these stories came out this week. It's not just coronavirus - it seems to be all vaccines. There's a good article on it - with the excellent headline ""No-vaxx Djokovic"" at https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/…And his wife has been pushing the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory. Most disturbingly of all, though, he believes in telekinesis. Surely this gives him an unfair advantage in tennis, and he should be banned? Effective use of telekinesis would be more effective than any sort of drug cheating."

True enough Ashtonian. I wish it was just a rumour. The problem with PC is that it’s a bottomless pit. It started out with good intentions but with unintended consequences.
"I'm sure I will get roasted for this, but don't you think one reason the late night hosts, Saturday Night Live, etc are ""bashing"" Trump is simply because he's the current president, and they are simply being topical?Have you seen Larry David's impression of Bernie Sanders on SNL? Or the many guys who do Biden? Or Kate McKinnon's Warren impersonation? They made fun of Obama, and they all also had field days with the Clintons when they were in office (Darrell Hammond's Bill Clinton impression was one of the best). They made fun of Bush (both of them). They will make fun of whoever gets elected in Nov.Walker, not too familiar with any Canadian late night shows, but would you watch any show that, nightly, poked fun at Stephen Harper or Paul Martin? Pretty stale stuff, that would be.Just saying..."
This Hour has 22 minutes.
"#257, you’re not wrong. At the beginning of SNL, Chevy Chase skewered Gerald Ford. Same with Jimmy Carter. It’s an American tradition to do it. And to rip Congress. It’s just that Trump and Friends provide so much material. https://youtu.be/xu2vdE0z7ds"
"#259,Yeah I know, I was stating the obvious (plus my posting was a little late from when some posts were complaining about topical humor).Forgot to mention, Fred Armisen's mocking impression of Mike Bloomberg is pretty good too. He also starred in ""Portlandia"" (getting through that on Netflix), really funny show that pokes fun at the granola / hipster vibe of that town. Sends up lots of stereotypes."
I love her.https:/…index.html
"With apologies to Eamonn Holmes et al...I liked this headline from The Betoota Advocate this week. I think it hits the nail on the head as far as outrageous rumours are concerned. The actual headline is NSFW. But then none of you are at work, so it doesn't matter. But I won't be able to put the link in here, because it contains a swear word. You'll just have to Google it.So here's the [sanitised] headline. ----Giving F---ing Morons Faster Access To Online Conspiracies Found To Be The Biggest Risk Of 5G"
"Posting about a former Australian Prime Minister on the ""Most famous"" thread reminded me of an excellent outrageous rumour about our current Prime Minister. For the Australians on the forum, you probably only need two words.Engadine Macca's. For the rest of you.... Google ""Engadine Macca's"". Trust me, it's worth it."
"In the news today, ""The parent company of Lysol and another disinfectant warned Friday that its products should not be used as an internal treatment for the coronavirus after President Donald Trump wondered about the prospect during a White House briefing."""
"Pirate pirate. Your TDS has clouded your thinking. That is not what Trump said. But here’s my outrageous rumour for the day. Donald Trump told Americans to inject Lysol and drink toilet bowl cleaner to kill COVID. He also said that he goes up to random women on the street and grabs them by the p#$&@. Wow ! I’m shocked ! What a misogynistic, racist, anti-science, antisemitic, bigoted, orange orangutan !"
"Walker,Here is a link to the transcript of that briefing, from the White House website: https:/…The 2nd paragraph in post #266 (""Maybe you can..."") can be found word for word in the transcript. He did in fact say that.He did talk about shining UV lights and ingesting disinfectants. Bill Bryan, head of the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, had talked about studies of UV lights and disinfectants on virus, on *hard, non-porous surfaces""....the President then said (copied quote directly from transcript): "" So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you’re going to test that too. It sounds interesting.""The President did not tell Americans to inject Lysol or drink toilet bowl cleaner. But he certainly makes a number of medical / scientific statements, that he is simply not qualified to make. When you are sick, do you go see a doctor, or a real estate developer?"
"The problem is, he's totally winging what he's going to say. He does not prepare. And he's not exactly articulate, which doesn't help. I'm no fan of his, but I don't think he meant to imply that people should be drinking lysol or disinfectant. Unfortunately when you talk on the fly off the top of your head without thinking, things come out the wrong way."
And it’s unfortunate they still can’t get over the election. So they foam off at the mouth in an attempt to make themselves feel better. Another sad phase of TSD. If it were not so sad it would be funny. I’m still very curious and concerned what they will do when Trump wins again.
"Just don't drink the Kool -Aid trumpy is asking you to, it could kill you ."
Perhaps scientists will develop a four year slow release Ambien that can be taken now so that the patients with TDS are put out of their self induced misery and wake up in the final months of the Trump administration.
Now for updates regarding Trump accomplishments. Today Trump signed the stimulus bill to aid enployers and hospitals. He has Withdrawn the United States from job killing Paris Climate Accord.
"Trump aka Jim Jones accomplishments, has asked all his loyal followers to drink the Clorex Kool-Aid !Or swallow a light bulb, whichever you think is best for you."
"Trump has moved to eliminate all Federally funded abortions while drastically reducing funding planned parenthood. Roll back almost all of Barack Hussein Obama’s regulations.Edited: 7:08 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Trump advices his followers to inject Clorex, Javex, etc.to help stop Covid -19.., come all you loyal Trumpets, do your duty, do what your President asks of you !"
That’s a sick statement.^ Perhaps a little emotionally unstable are you.
Geesh Nova. Don’t you have enough stuff to worry about out there ? Another shooting near Halifax today. I haven’t heard the latest updates but lately you’ve lost more people to mass shootings than COVID. And only five people allowed at each funeral because.....social distancing. How heartless.
"Walker, the only deranged contributor here seems to be yourself.Why are you even apologising for the behaviour of the person who became president through an aberration in a flawed voting system?"
@Yarrmar....talk about deranged. It’s a ~250 year system of voting in neither of our countries ! I don’t get why you’re such a Trump hater. What has he done to you ?
Yarramar you ignore the fact that Trump would / could’ve won with a popular vote method also. He would just change his strategy. He’s brilliant. There a lot of detachment from reality with TDS suffers. Good luck.
"Walker and Katy,You undercut your arguments with your name calling. I called Walker out on his comment that ""Trump didn't say that"". White House transcripts document he said it. Go back to my post, open the transcript, and search for quote. Unless the ""Deep State"" has reached into the Oval Office itself? I will give you this, he is brilliant. His statement during the campaign, that he could shoot someone in the middle of 5th Ave, and his poll numbers wouldn't go down, is more true today than a few years ago. Sad but true."
“He’s brilliant.”Just how low must your bar be set???
chi - why don’t you call out the name calling and insults from Trump haters on this forum. Oh that’s right you are one of them. And of course there’s the good old double standard that applies to the lefties.
"Walker, I do not hate Trump. In fact not long after he was elected I actually admired him. Bur, as one of the genuinely great US presidents said:“You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.”"
"Post #278 is about as low as you can get ... you must be really proud of that one Walker.Edited: 8:44 pm, April 24, 2020 "
Yep. That’s just...gross. He/she should be ashamed of himself/herself.
"Walker, just what the he*l are you talking about ? There was no shooting in Halifax, or Nova Scotia today . Do you just sit around and make up lies to pass the time of day, you really are a sick individual !"
"Kat,I've asked you and Walker a few times, to provide explanations for statements Trump has made...heck, even an opinion as to what you think he mean. But, you have both responded by accusing me of TDS or saying ""not worth responding"". And again, when asking you / Walker if you checked the White House transcripts that verify the President said what it was reported he said, you ask why I'm not beating up other folks posting on the forum.None of the other posters, that I can recall, have insulted me (or tried to insult me), besides you and Walker. I haven't insulted either of you. Go back and look at all my posts on this thread and tell me in which one I have.Some of the ""lefties"" have posted some things that definitely aren't worded very tactfully, but I think most of them are their opinions. I can't call someone out for their opinion. As I said, I don't believe I've insulted either of you (maybe asking Walker if he'd see a doctor or a real estate developer if he was sick crossed the line? pretty tame compared to most comments here).I suppose it's more entertaining for everyone to try to come up with insults and provocative statements (I'd love to see Walker post a link to a reputable news source that verifies his claim of another shooting, for example).I guess I'm hoping that I will get a reasoned response instead of a brush off or insult...my bad.Gonna watch some TV, see you guys tomorrow sometime...have fun!"
>>> Nothing will change my mind and millions of others who support him<<<Kind of reminds me of the attitude of the North Koreans
"Done with TV for now...Please point out any self righteous statements, or anything even remotely related to ""hatred"" that I've posted.Please point out any insults I've made to the President - I've merely quoted his tweets and provided links to White House transcripts.Regarding the briefings, I merely pointed out that Walker was wrong when he claimed the President didn't say what he, absolutely according to the transcript, did say. You know, today he also said he was being sarcastic with his comments during Thursday's briefings, and that he was mockingly asking the reporters those questions to see how they would report it. He was very subtle about it, though, if you watch Thursday's briefing, he never seemed to engage reporters during that part of it, but seemed to be asking Birx and Murphy about looking into it. Maybe I didn't catch his sarcasm . Why do you suppose he felt it necessary to be sarcastic (his word, not mine_ to reporters during the briefing?Pretty clear nothing will change your mind, or the millions of others who support him. No argument from me there. I'm not asking you to. Merely asking you to explain or help me understand his comments."
"<< I saw nothing did you read that , NOTHING wrong with Trumps briefing period.>>>So you saw nothing wrong with Trump telling US citizens to take Clorex, Javex , etc to take for Covid -19.., helloooo Jim Jones !!! ( that's one Kool -Aid I'm not touching )"
"Just because you’ve got all the leftist talking point ducks in a row doesn’t mean you have a clue. You’ve completely lost it in your Trump hatred. Pretty pathetic really especially from people who aren’t even United States citizens. Who gives a **** what you think ?! And same goes for me, a Canadian citizen. Can we not have discussion without bringing up Trump ? I only started that other Trump thread to try to draw all the Trump opinions to one thread rather than having it an ongoing theme. That thread got moved to the OTC Forum which should be called the OCD Forum. And now we’re back to juvenile Trump bashing on every other post. Happy quarantine everyone. I’m done here."
"^^^ Just because you won't admit to what your "" Leader "" has spoken to , and on record I might add , speaks volumes to your character  <<, I’m done here.>> ( That's the usual out when they don't have anything to say ) Well we will see if you're a person of your word or not .Edited: 12:19 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Walker, of course no US citizens give a s**t what I or Canadians think about Trump. However your views must be pretty offensive to fellow Canadians.Do you remember this?https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireSto…"
"Just for you Nova, I’m ba-a-a-ack ! And Yarramar why don’t you stick to what you do know which is Australians. Our government sent 16 tons of PPE equipment to China in January and then when we needed them we came up short. Canadians are a diverse bunch, not all that different from Ozzies.:)Edited: 12:45 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Yup Walker.., and just like I kneeeeew you would be .! I'm just surprised you took that long . Your word is just like trumps, a worthless piece of sh*t. ! LMFAOF!!!"
I’ll give you a pass for that because you’re in the throes of stage 4 Trump Derangement Syndrome. I hope you get better soon.
"Hey Walter, what about your bullsh*t # 278 ? Talk about fake news, straight from Fox Entertainment ?"
"Wow. SWNova. Take a chill pill. What is wrong with you ?besides the obvious, not to mention being obsessed. Did you know that people who are angry and constantly complain have increased levels of Cortisol? This can lead to serious health problems. Put some music on or something."
"I thought it was worth resurrecting this thread for this gem from yesterday's news:More than 40% of Republicans think Bill Gates will use COVID-19 vaccine to implant tracking chips, survey sayshttps:/…Of course, I do have my doubts about this survey - you can always bend survey results by wording your questions carefully. It's beautifully explained here by Sir Humphrey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ZZJXw4MTABut even with some good leading questions, that's a LOT of people believing a really quite impressive level of nonsense. Unless, of course, some of you think it's true, in which case I apologise*. * No I don't."
Maybe Hilary Clinton will implant a chip in Bill to know where and who he is with
@302 There are so many conspiracy theorists here that they should pass out tinfoil hats with birth certificates
agree with #277 with what that person said against #276 response. Obviously a very sick and demented individual to post something like that
"That I live in a Covid hot spot and somehow it is connected to guns. Oh, Really?"
"In the UK, you can now travel as far as you like, and do whatever you like, as long as you are in the process of testing your eyesight."

"Outrageous rumour: The US ""stimulus payment"" is being paid to stimulate the US economy. Actually, it is being paid to all US citizens, even those who have not lived in the US for many, many years and whose ties to the US are loose to extent of not even having a US bank account to deposit the cheque in. (It is sent by post)How on earth can that stimulate the US economy? (BTW, it comes with a letter signed by Donald J Trump. Ex pats can vote no matter how long they have been away)If I were paying taxes in the US I would be rather angry about all that tax money being given away to no purpose.Edited: 12:52 pm, June 13, 2020 "
