"On May 8, 2020 Bali has 300 confirmed cases with 195 has been recovered or the recovery rate is 65 percent, the best in Indonesia. The death is 4 or mortality rate is 1.3 percent.Is health facilities in Bali the best in Indonesia, the answer is certainly not. I guess because most of the cases in Bali come from migrant workers work at cruise ships with relatively strong persons, so need only short period of recoveries."
Is this supposed to be reassuring?
Blinding us with science again Sarwa?
More like baffling us with bull sh*t
"Most the PCR tests on Bali nowadays are done by Bali Laboratory, so there are local data cover only Bali and national data cover all Indonesian data, both maybe slightly different, but not much, only cut-pff time different."
Your claims are m8aleadibg and without merit...and may I ask when you received your Medical degree. You cone on here with irrelevant information that is highly flawed...you have been proven wrong on many occasions. For others that case becoming increasingly frustrated with Sarwa...if we don't respond he may just go away
"On May 16, 2020 recovery rate in Bali is 70 percent with 346 accumulative cases of Covid-19 and 243 recovered. if there are no new cases, so in 2 weeks or maximum 30 days all will be recovered, so Bali can be a green zone or at least Covid-19 restrictions can be eased.On the same day recovery rate in West Nusa Tenggara is 51 percent with 365 accumulative cases of Covid-19 and 188 recovered.Both can get same Covid-19 restrictions eased, or Bali first, but not Java."
"#16,That’s very odd because the data I saw today from Lapuran Media harian covid-19 16 May said;“Update 16 mei 2020, Bali has 3 new cases and 11 recovery. 100 active cases.”How’s Bandung?"
"Give it a rest Sarwa. Your government paid lies fool no one anymore.Can i ask, out of matter of interest how much you are being paid?"
"I mentioned about accumulative number, not daily. If there are 3 new cases means it will recovered in 14 days to 30 days. Usually in Bali no need too long for recovering. New cases maybe is still exist, but if the daily recovery cases number are bigger than new cases number, so the active cases will decrease. 3 new cases compare to 11 recovery is very good. Even China and Vietnam nowadays have still active cases.On May 16, 2020 in Bali accumulative cases of Covid-19 is 346, 4 deceased and 243 recovered, so the active cases is 346 - 4 - 243 = 99. Your number is 100. There are slightly different, because of different cut-off time, between local data and central data.West Java is better than 2 weeks ago means new cases is decreasing. We cannot talk only Bandung city, because there are Bandung Raya and talk about Bandung Raya only can mislead, because West Java has population 50 million same as South Korea, so West Java is very different with Bali. You can isolates Bali easily by cut the ferries and the flights, but West Java as a land is more difficult to maintain."
Yes Bull I have just spoke to my friend who lives in Denpasar on his street alone 15 neighbours confirmed positive this week. Dengue fever mis diagnosed.
David I think I'll believe your friend in Denpasar before the other rubbish Sarwa is pushing on here.
Dianne...Ive reported Sarwa for his ongoing fake info...husr got sick of him
"Gidget good on you, oh god I try hard not to respond because I think that's what feeds him but........."
Dianne W I just couldn't put up with the rubbish Sarwa posts...don't know if anything will happen but nothing will if people don't report the misinformation Sarwa is posting
"Gidget for a while there posts were being deleted but then started to be reinstated, but agree with you 100%, enough is enough."
"Is there anyone out there who can ban Sarwa from Trip Advisor forums. I have been stunned, gobsmacked by his incoherent rubbish, had a laugh etc but enough is enough. I report him for spam but there doesn't seem to be any way to complain about someone repeatedly posting complete gobbly dook on multiple forums."
All we can do is not read the posts and dont rise to the bait. Soon get bored
"No David, Sarwa doesn't get bored, he doesn't care that his posts make others want to eat ground glass, he does not care if his posts have any real bearing on the topic or are even accurate. He just googles a lot and posts and posts and posts,"
"Related to number 7, on May 17, 2020 there are 2 new cases and 7 recoveries, so the recovery rate is 71.84 percent and the best in Indonesia.https://www.antaranews.com/berita/1497720/71…"
So now the voice of Bandung is not doing cumulative cases... make up your mind!
"Once again, the question remains: what is the total number of tests undertaken and how many of those are presenting with symptoms? Until there is clear evidence of a comprehensive testing regime throughout Bali, Sarwa’s PR figures are pointless."
"Sarwa, just go away. You are not contributing anything useful or enjoyable to this forum and are, in effect, just spamming it. I have reported you and your posts, and I encourage everyone else to do the same if they haven't already done so.Do you understand?"
MelMMM ....I don't think Sarwa cares at all...I noticed he posted after posts complaining about him...again just the usual rubbish...Ive Made a complaint as many have and he still posts...TA are doing nothing.
"I do wonder what the criteria are to have someone blocked - multiple spam reports don't seem to be enough. I did try PMing him but that got nowhere. Silly thing is that Sarwa's poor approach adds credibility to the theory that there's something being hidden, opposite to what his intentions are."
"actually what sarwa is stating is just govt figures..as indonesia have very limited test capacity, so the figures is very low ..btw, about 15 people tested positive in one street in denpasar ??its clearly wrong..maybe just assumed bot not confirmed .."
"Qures, on many occasions people have cited other sources that dispute what Sarwa is saying, often he'll quote older data and when he does link to a source, it's often not directly related to what he's talking about so all in all, he has no credibility. And he doesn't listen to any feedback people give him about moderating his posts so they are more helpful and collaborative. It's just a blast of random figures and incomprehensible language that is not informative. He's undermining any efforts the Indonesian government might be making to be open and transparent in their response to Covid-19 as everything he posts has some kind of PR spin on it, which makes everyone think that there's something to hide. So that's the long story about why we don't believe anything he posts and want him to stop, even if he occasionally does post something accurate. It may seem rude to do it in this public forum but I've tried PMing him and got nowhere."
It has been suggested to be that Sarwa is being paid by the govt to spread info that Indo is safe...makes complete sense to me that the govt would be employing influencers.Ivwxalso been told that TA have had significant staff cuts so is probably why the many complaints about him aren't being dealt with
its very possible the govt are paying influencer in social media... actually its political standard here..because peoples mind are so easily shaped via social media these days especially in indonesia..
"Hi,And here’s the story to confirm it. https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.thejakart…Cheers"
Ah the irony of Sarwa being called an influencer!
"PaulosussexThanks for posting this...seems it's true...Sarwa is being paid to ""influence"" tourists to return by downplaying the situation..hopefully he'll read this and stop"
They’re not getting their money’s worth with Sarwa.
"Sorry, Sarwa may be a PITA but there is no proof he is being paid to influence."

"#29,Isn't that outdated old news before the travel ban ? Oh, or do mean those steps taken have helped Bali to recover faster."
"#35,Yes, it is a story from before flights were suspended. It is to illustrate that the Indonesian government were happy to pay influencers to boost tourism and I doubt their stance will have changed much.Cheers"
"Seriously, post 34? With all due respect, the issue is whether the current statistics coming out of Bali are rubbery because there is no evidence being provided regarding the extent of testing for virus cases."
This is getting bizarre now.
It's possible though Hunter...ans dies make sense..ww have these and thing happening here on FB with Trolls...tgwy may not get paid but they do the work for various causes
"Why would the Indonesian government pay someone to ""influence"" people into coming back to Bali, when tourists aren't allowed in, and Bali isn't scheduled to open until October ? Beats me."
Interesting article with opinions on why Bali seems to be doing better than other parts of Indonesia:https://www.traveller.com.au/coronavirus-and…
Nicolas it's all about spin...Govts do it all the time.
"Unfortunately, a less promising article as well :(https:/…12258044"
"Indeed everybody spins, and any which way. Our own press and our own governments are the best at it, indeed I learned the meaning of the word spin when I was living in London in the late '90s/early '00s, under Blair. So why should I favor a picture of the situation in Bali as decribed in some medias, over that reported by Sarwa ? I'll (maybe) get an idea of what's going on in Bali when I get there, in the meantime, it's all spin(like, for instance, the fake stories about spike in infections in Germany after the lockdown was lifted, that where repeated ad nauseam in our media)"
"Okay, we definitely have conflicting stories. That article says that Bali is going to open in July.However, there are so many articles/releases saying that Bali is going to reopen to tourists in October via the Indonesian govthttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thejakartap…https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…It's to my understanding that Bali isn't independent - they can't get the ok to reopen if the Indonesian govt doesn't say so. Hell, doesn't even matter if tourists aren't allowed to come into the country anyway"
"#42Bali is NOT doing better than other parts of Indonesia. Indonesia has 34 provinces and 22 of them have less corona victims than Bali.https://www.antaranews.com/covid-19It is very difficult to find the correct news in Indonesia. Also about reopening the country. There are rumours about June, July, October, the end of the year etc. It doesn't make sense untill the official announcement from immigration.https://www.imigrasi.go.id/https://www.imigrasi.go.id/berita/detail/inf…(this one has been updated 11th May)"
"By the numbers in your post, Bali is doing better than 11 other parts of Indonesia. I did not say all other parts.This thread is on the Bali sub forum, my intention was only to provide a link to a positive story to try and cut through the doom and gloom. I offered no opinion of my own."
"On May 18, 2020 Bali announced 11 new cases and 7 recoveries.But in number 7 and number 9 there are 3 new cases and 11 recoveries.And in number 19 there are 2 new cases and 7 recoveries.So for 3 consecutive days there are 16 new cases and 25 recoveries, still good and flattening the curve has been done.Nowadays infection from local transmission is about 40 percent and infection from migrant workers will decrease, because there are not many anymore migrant workers will come to Bali. Migrant workers can come to Bali directly or through Jakarta."
"How many tests are being undertaken each day, Sarwa? If that information isn’t disclosed, your figures count for nothing."

That sums it up nicely david.
"#47actually i can say bali is doing one of the best to prevent the virus spread.. if you see situation in bali now (not very crowded hospital, no significant unexplained death) . if u compare number of chinese and european tourist coming to bali in feb and march then this situation now can be said is very goodone thing i know that balinese are much more discipline than many other indonesian .."
"Then they're doing better than many Australians too, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of discipline here. I'm really glad that Bali is going well, it was heartbreaking to think of everyone over there being hit badly by this. I think it would be simpler without all the tourists but it's still difficult in such a close society. What's everyone doing - wearing masks, keeping distance?"
"90% people wear mask here in denpasar..not so much keeping distance but anywhere is much quieter these days , restaurants mostly empty, no outside event, no ngaben , no going to temple, church and mosque, also traffic is dropped by halfjust some muslim majority area is crowded these days because its approaching lebaran festive.btw bali is doing pretty well against covid.. but the economy not so well :(Edited: 3:25 am, May 19, 2020 "
"Balinese is more discipline than the others and in my knowledge has good ethical work also.Bali has pecalang which control of public maybe same or better than police.In outside Bali you can see many people go shopping for Ied Day and many of them not use mask. Maybe there are increase of positive Covid-19 patients, after Ied Day, but certainly not in Bali."
"Qures, people will be back as soon as they can, I have no doubt there's lots of people here who'll have flights booked on that first day!"
"On May 19, 2020 in Bali there are additional of 4 positive Covid-19 patients, 10 patients are recovered.So, for 4 consecutive days, please see number 49, there are 16+4=20 new cases and 25+10=35 are recovered."
"On May 20, 2020 in Bali additional of 4 positive Covid-19 patients, is doubled with 8 patients, but recovered patients is still bigger than additional cases with 9 patients..So, for 5 consecutive days, there are 20+8=28 new cases and 35+9=43 are recovered."
"I will monitor Bali day by day until May 30, 2020 or 14 days after May 16, 2020 which I has mentioned in number 6. If recovery rate is still increasing, so we only wait for Bali opening, except there are second wave.On May 21, 2020 in Bali there are additional of 3 positive Covid-19 patients, 4 patients are recovered.So, for 6 consecutive days, there are 28+3=31 new cases and 43+4=47 are recovered.But today there are biggest jump of new cases in Indonesia with 973 which mainly come from East Java with 502 or jump by 502/2496=20 percent increase. I think there are several big clusters in East Java and it will open last for Java. Jakarta and West Java maybe will be open earlier, however Bali is better a lot. West Nusa Tenggara can follow Bali with recovery rate 217/410=52.9 percent."
"In East Java, there are no new clusters, except new cluster of 20 persons from a hospital which 12 persons are nurses, medical doctor and specialist doctor, but they have no relation with positive Covid-19 patients. It means they get infection from patient without any symptoms.311 new cases are from Surabaya city only.502 cases are from samples are taken in 3 days, but increase by 20 percent in 3 days is still very high."
"You can “monitor “ Bali all you want, Sarwa, but the figures won’t mean anything until there is clear evidence of the number of tests undertaken there each day. If the provincial government won’t release daily testing numbers, there’s no reassurance that a comprehensive testing program is underway.As of last night, Indonesia has seen a huge jump in confirmed coronavirus cases with a record 973 new cases, taking the total number to 20,162 and total deaths to 1,278 (up 36). The increase comes despite the extreme low rate of testing - still only 160,000 people overall. There is a long way to go before the spread of the virus can be determined properly."
"I have mentioned there are biggest jump of new cases in Indonesia with 973 in number 67.You can monitor Indonesia in Worldometer. The correct number of total tests are 219,975 and not 160,000."
Number 61 and not 67.
"Sarwa, Bailey is referring to total number of people tested not the number of tests. Worldometer does not list total number of people tested, ourworldindata does however. As of 20 May that was 160,000 people tested."
"Sarwa as of yesterday Australia has conducted 1,015,652 tests from a population of 25.5 million. Indonesia's testing rate is a tiny drop in the ocean and case numbers reflect that. Like it or not there would be many many undiagnosed cases spreading through the community in Indonesia. So the numbers put out by Indonesia are far from accurate."
"Previously there are 31 positive Covid-19 patients in Bondalem Village, Buleleng. 15 of 31 are traders which one of them is the first. To realize that it can make infections to other villages, so all 4,000 family of Bondalem Village do voluntary 14 days quarantine and nowadays is still ongoing. 60 percent are recovered and hopefully end of May there are no patients in Buleleng Regency.Bali can better than other province, because Bali has high discipline. So, for 7 consecutive days, there are 31+6=37 new cases and 47+4=51 are recovered.In East Java there are 131 new cases. So, the total is 2,998+131=3,129."
"Logically massive test can reflect big case numbers, but maybe not absolute.Based on Worldometer today, Australia do 45,968 tests per one Million population, Singapore do 50,367 and South Korea do 15,887, but the best to handle Covid-19 is Australia and South Korea which relatively pair and Singapore is worse.If the number is correct, so Japan as the rich country is the most effective and efficient to handle Covid-19 with only 2,099 tests per one Million population. USA do 42,050 tests. And the best to handle Covid-19 is Japan and then USA and Singapore is worse.Why Japan can do it. I will give the answer when Indonesia do 1,500 tests per one Million population and it will take about 3 weeks from nowadays or at about mid-June 2020. Certainly if there are no spike is caused by Ied Day gathering."
"Your “answers” are tedious and misinformed, Sarwa. They are best ignored and deleted."
"On May 23, 2020 accumulative cases in Bali is 388 and patients have been recovered is 287 or recovery rate is almost 74 percent. But Bali Governor afraid to open Bali.Greece with recovery rate below 50 percent will open the country for foreign tourists starting on June 15, 2020.Today, East Java spike again with 466 new cases, so in the last 3 days there are 502+131+466=1099 new cases and the accumulative cases are 3,595. Very bad."
Afraid of Opening or Not?
"The Bali Governor afraid for opening, maybe because East Java the neighbour is not good. But to ease restrictions in Bali itself are possible, but not for human traffic from Java. In Jakarta, although you have Jakarta ID, you cannot go into Jakarta without paper that you work in Jakarta."
"as your previuos post.. i dont agree with saying dont handle covid well. for me they handled it very good with fast testing. good isolation and very low death.thats the use of massive testing.. unlike indonesia which have very low testing and is making bad death rate and crowded hospitalbtw , its true that the good handling of covid in bali can be in vain if the govt cant limit number of people who will come from east java"
"On May 24, 2020 Bali has 394 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 293, so the recovery rate is 74.4 percent or better than yesterday.Please read number 69 first.In East Java today there are additional 68 new cases, so total new cases for the last 4 days is 1099+68=1167 and accumulative cases are 3595+68=3663. Most of the patients are from Surabaya City, Sidoarjo Regency and Gresik Regency. most of it are from available clusters, so tracing is do not well. Other question is why only this 3 area have significant new cases, tests are done in other area in East Java, even in Indonesia. Indonesia nowadays do about 10.000 swab test per day.The key to handle Covid-19 is discipline. In Pamekasan there are several positive Covid-19 patients want to go home for Ied Day. The doctors and nurses lock the rooms from outside, but the family from the patients are threatening them, but the doctors and nurses dare to fight it.Nowadays East Java is still making field hospital with capacity 500 beds for mild and moderate patients. Usually if they feel well, they want to go home or even go walking around outside the hospital. I do not know it will goes well or not. In Jakarta Emergency Hospital in Athlete Village is also for mild and moderate patients, but the apartments are being watched by army and police, even a group of patients must stay at one certain level only. No chance for run away, even the family cannot enter the hospital area, outside the fence. In some hospitals, there are patients who run away. Jakarta has good discipline."
"On May 25, 2020 Bali has 396 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 295. Both have additional 2 each. If Bali has no new cases anymore, Bali can be as green zone soon. Aceh has accumulative cases 19, one is passed away and 17 have been recovered, so the active case is only one and there are no new case for the several latest days. Aceh maybe will be the first province in Indonesia can be a green zone. The key of it is discipline.In East Java today there are additional 223 new cases, so total new cases for the last 5 days is 1167+223=1390 and accumulative cases are 3663+223=3886.In number 69, I have mentioned about Japan with relatively small number of tests, 2144 as today number per one Million population. Today, on 25 May, Japan ended the state of emergency in all of Japan. The key of success is not massive tests, but tracing well. Usually Japan do tracing to flu and TBC patients."
"On May 26, 2020 Bali has 407 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 295. The recovery rate drop to 72.5 percent means there are new cases more than additional recovered patients.There are plan about New Normal or Normal Life with Covid-19 Health Protocol, use mask, physical distancing and only maximum 50 percent capacity in the public transport, mall, etc. DKI Jakarta Province, West Java Province, West Sumatra Province, Gorontalo Province and 25 other regencies/cities are the plan. The criteria for it as I analyze is growth of new cases in the latest 2 weeks. As example in the last 3 days DKI Jakarta new cases are always decreasing and for the latest day only 61 new cases or the growth of new cases is 0.9 percent or less than 1 percent, but more than 0.5 percent. If Bali has one case means the growth of new cases is 1/407=0.25 percent, so Bali must has new cases not more than 4 or 4/407=0.98 percent. but in number 60, on May 20, 2020 or 6 days ago there are 8 new cases. I believe Bali can be New Normal too soon."
"On May 27, 2020 Bali has 415 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 302. The recovery rate is 72.7 percent. New cases in Bali are still a lot.East Nusa Tenggara has announced to open domestic and international flights starting on June 15, 2020. The problem is Central Government want it or not, certainly with VOA. At least East Nusa Tenggara has a brave to do it. There are 85 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 9. The recovery rate is only 10.5 percent. It is rather impossible to be a New Normal.Is DKI Jakarta fair to be a New Normal. The criteria is the last 14 days the growth of new cases is declining to maximum 50 percent. On May 27, 2020 the new cases in DKI Jakarta is 206 or significant jump from 61 in the previous day. So, the growth of new cases is 206/6689=3.0 percent. It is rather impossible to be a New Normal, but who is know there are something strange decision."
"Correction, On May 27, 2020 the new cases in DKI Jakarta is 97 and not 206 or jump from 61 in the previous day. So, the growth of new cases is 97/6797=1.4 percent. On May 13, 2020 the new cases is 5554-5375=179 or the growth of new cases is 179/5375=3.3 percent."
"Good grief Sarwa !! 4 posts in a row with a whole lot of googled maths equations. We don't need them we can research numbers ourselves, we all have access to the internet in case you're not aware."
"Dianne, I am not sure who actually reads Sarwa's posts as I stopped a long time ago. As soon as I see numbers, percentages and dates, I know it's going to be a complete waste of my time trying to read often irrelevant information and make sense of what's contained in the post."
"I think you’re right, Sue and Dianne. All he is posting now is basically irrelevant figures that make absolutely no sense. I can’t even be bothered refuting them any more because it’s all rubbish. I will, however, say for the umteenth time that there is little comfort in the official data until the authorities release the daily testing figures. Until we have a better idea of how comprehensively (or otherwise) testing is occurring across Bali’s population, caution should be exercised re future travel. Cheers"
"Daily testing, certainly available, maybe you are not googling well and not listen to Covid-19 spokesman. On May 27, 2020 there are more than 14,000 swab test, certainly per day."
"I’m not interested in your fake figures, post #86. I’ll just repeat this again - the daily testing numbers for Bali are not being released by authorities. Understand that? There is no such number as “14,000” tests occurring in Bali nor in Indonesia overall."
"More than 14,000 test per day, certainly for all of Indonesia, if South Korea says 15,000 test per day, so, it means for all of South Korea and not for Seoul only."
Just go away. You’re a blight on the good reputation of Bandung.
"On May 28, 2020 Bali has 420 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 314. The recovery rate is 74.7 percent.To enter Bali from Banyuwangi needs Rapid Test and it cost Rp 350,000. Some workers must go to Bali, because the shops will open soon.Most of Covid-19 is by local transmission and even one of it is foreign person. I never heard for the last weeks foreign person got Covid-19. Maybe the person is not discipline.A private party with more than 15 persons in a Villa, Mengwi, Badung Regency has been dissolved, because not inline with Covid-19 health protocol. The villa is rented by 4 persons and all must do compulsory reporting to the police."
"On May 29, 2020 Bali has 443 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 320. The recovery rate is 72.2 percent. Significant drop. Bali is not already for New Normal.Karawang Regency, West Java based on WHO New Normal criteria can be a New Normal area, but the regency choose to extent PSBB, Large Scale Social Restriction."
"On May 30, 2020 Bali has 455 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 328. The recovery rate is 72.0 percent. drop again, however is very slight. Bali is not already for New Normal.But do not worry about the tests, there are sufficient tests in every sites of Indonesia. If it is not sufficient, can contact Covid-19 Central Task Force as Surabaya Major do. Central sent 2 Laboratory Mobile BSL 2, please see Rapid test kit and PCR test kit made in/by Indonesia. But the Laboratory Mobiles are for all of East Java, because one the laboratory in East Java got trouble. The Laboratory Mobiles do testing not in Surabaya makes the major angry, but the authority is belong to Covid-19 Local Task Force and they feel Surabaya is not the priority anymore, because most of the new cases are from the available clusters."
"On May 31, 2020 Bali has 465 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 329. The recovery rate is 70.7 percent. Become worse, New Normal needs more time for Bali."
"At post #61 on this topic Sarwa you stated:""I will monitor Bali day by day until May 30, 2020 or 14 days after May 16, 2020 which I has mentioned in number 6.""It's now past May 30 2020, or 14 days after May 16, 2020 using the power of mathematics."
"Yes, there are second wave in Bali. Previously, in Bali most of positIve Covid-19 patients are migrant workers from cruises ships, they are relatively healthy, so easy to get well, even in less than 14 days, and to monitor them is also easy. Nowadays the most patients are from local transmissions, include one foreign person. The patients seems not so healthy as the migrant workers from cruise ships, so need more time in hospital. Today, there are 10 new cases in Bali, if it is belong to one cluster only, so it is easy to handle, but I'm afraid it come from many clusters and even is not yet known the cluster."
Kinda missing the point there.
"Previously, Bali Governor has mentioned that not to open Bali for tourism soon, because afraid of local transmission, but seems it comes earlier."
"Nope, still missing the point."
"Just let him chatter away to himself, HNB, it seems to make him happy even if the rest of us can't work out what he's talking about."
Sarwa is the Black Knight of this forum.
"On June 1, 2020 Bali has 482 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 334. The recovery rate is 69.2 percent. Become worse. With the figure Bali is not already to be a New Normal.Is the recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia. The answer is still yes. The recovery rate for Indonesia is 28.3 percent whereas DKI Jakarta is 30.3 percent and East Java is 13.2 percent.The problem of Bali is still have new cases, and there are no tend to decrease. It is different with DKI Jakarta,. on May 13, 2020 has 179 new cases and on June 1, 2020 has about 100 new cases.However, Bali Governor has mentioned to open Bali in certain area for preparation of New Normal."
Enough. Surely?
I’m almost wistful for the days when we only had to endure false information about Nusa Dua.
Sarwa there have been 2 more deaths in past 24 hours in Bali and yet you continue to report it’s safe Get your facts straight I get accurate information from Bali COVID 19 update Facebook group
"A good reminder, Karen (post #104) that Jackie Pomeroy is doing a great job on that Facebook group. It’s certainly the best place to find the correct information. Cheers"
"On June 2, 2020 Bali has 487 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 334. The recovery rate is 68.6 percent. Drop again, because there are no new recovered, but new cases is 5. If the peak has been achieved, so for the rest, we only wait for flattening the curve.Indonesia death rate is 6.0 percent, relatively same with world death rate. Bali has 5 death, so the death rate is 5/487=1.0 percent, good, even compare with some richer countries."
"Tell us about the 12 year old child who has died from Covid 19 after being misdiagnosed as having dengue fever, post 106. How many more Coronavirus cases are being incorrectly attributed to dengue?"
"Sarwa, why do you feel the need to compare other countries to Bali, or even Indonesia?"
"Wow, poor kid, that's very sad.He was extremely unlucky, infection fatality rates for under 20 yo are in the ballpark of 1 in 10.000/100.000"
"First you must have a benchmark, as Japan or as USA.24 May 2020, the kid get fever, 28 May 2020 is treated in Ganesha Gianyar Hospital, 30 May 2020 Rapid Test is taken with result reactive and then patient is moved to Sanglah Hospital and take the swab test.The question is not why rapid test is done, after 2 days in hospital, but if the patient suspect of Dengeu Fever, there are 28, 29 and 30 May 2020 to test the thrombocyte to ensure dengeu fever or not. We do not know the thrombocyte tests have been taken or not, but the medical record can tell the truth.The patient died on May 31, 2020 and has been buried with WHO Covid-19 protocol. The swab test result finish on June 1, 2020 is positive and has been counted as Bali Covid-19 death."
Sarwa Do you have something better to do other than post stuff which is mostly complete mumbo jumbo. (bahasa raban)
"I’ll repeat the key question: How many more Coronavirus cases are being incorrectly attributed to dengue?No international benchmarks are required unless you want to obsfucate because you can’t answer the question. The Indonesian authorities still refuse to release figures for suspected Coronavirus deaths, including Bali, so how can any potential visitor assess the risk to their health with any confidence?"
"It is all very well to benchmark Sarwa, if you are consistent with your benchmarks, and you are not. You pick the ones you want that will paint Indonesia in a better light."
Just saw a news report of a 57 yr. old Australian man found dead in a guesthouse in Canggu after suffering respiratory symptons. The Covid 19 medical squad have attended but no other details as yet.
"Hi,The problem with following this thread is that the info is often days out of date and positive cases are recorded in the province of origin and not the actual location. Suspicious deaths are subject to testing - or not - and results take days. I thought the child in Gianyar was death 5 and death 6 was a 57 indonesian in Mengwi, but it’s all too opaque to have any idea. What is happening is that the cases are on an upward trend which is concerning. Cheers"
Apparently this was 3am this morning (June 3)
"Hi,Yes that’s what the Bali Post are reporting, it will take about a week to confirm if it was covid-19 if they bother to test. Cheers"
Or put it down to dengue again
"I know Japan is better than Indonesia, so maybe Indonesia can follow Japan, not all, but some of it."
"On June 3, 2020 Bali has 490 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 349. The recovery rate is 71.2 percent. Amazing, there are 15 have been recovered in a day. Not worry about Bali.In Surabaya, East Java massive tests have been done, but the reproduction rate of infection is decreasing means in PSBB or Large Scale Social Restriction I and II before are not done well."
"Actually Sarwa, you are wrong. The 15 recoveries is for 2 days, not a single day. They include a revised figure from the day before which was orginally reported as 0 but should have been 8."
"Thank you Calla, I quote the data from Central Data, different cut off time can make different figure with Local Data. But it can be rec·on·ciled, if we want. Example, Local says that there are additional fatality 2 persons in one day, but in Central Data is only one. There are many possibilities, maybe the other person is not positive Covid-19 patient, but has been burried as suspected Covid-19 inline with WHO protocol and local count it as body count. The other maybe double counting. And the important thing is the data from formal institution or not, you cannot rely on social media such as Facebook."
"“... you cannot rely on social media such as Facebook”. You’re hilarious, Sarwa. I’d rely on Jackie Pomeroy’s Facebook page with much more confidence than on the troll bunkum you spread here."

"Thank you Sarwa. I assume you are also part of Jackies Facebook group, how else would you know that is where i got my information from. One would suggest that Jackie's information is far more factual than yours. She aslo gets her information from formal institutions, but unlike you she doesn't manipulate the figures to suit her narrative. I encourage all people who read the Indonesian forums to join Jackie's group, as it is good information about all of Indonesia, and it counters Sarwa's dishonest ramblings.Edited: 4:29 am, June 04, 2020 "
"But credit where credit is due Sarwa. At least you admitted you were wrong by explaining timing differences to us, just don't explain it as a great victory for Bali."
"First cut of time is different. Central data use high noon time. Local usually use cut off time later, you must check the cut off time. The president has mentioned that he want one data. Some local even have more than one data.If you say there are manipulation figure, please tell me which one, so we can know which data is correct, Data never lies.The president want more test per day up to 20,000. Nowadays test per day is more than 10,000, for 7 days from 28 May to 3 June is 76,023 or 10,860 average test per day."
"On June 4, 2020 Bali has 510 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 364. The recovery rate is 71.3 percent. Amazing again, after yesterday there are 15 have been recovered in a day, today there are another 15. You can check to your reliable data is double counting or not. Not worry about Bali.The president has mentioned to use internet to handle suspect/positive Covid-19 patients as uses in South Korea and NZ."
"Sarwa - in post #124 you state ""....you cannot rely on social media such as Facebook.""TripAdvisor is social media.So therefore we cannot rely on the information on Tripadvisor by this definition."
"Thank you Happynoodleboy.Yes, and a good one.Social media is a technology that enables multi-way conversation among users. Trip Advisor runs on mostly user-generated content like reviews, and allows people to create a profile, share, like, comment, upvote, etc.One thing that I love is there are administrator and the administrator seems read all deleted post. There are my posts have been deleted, but suddenly appear again without I mention anything. Several data maybe seems incorrect, but after several days, that is true, example about 10,000 tests per day. The other thing you cannot sell anything as a vendor in your post."
"I appreciate you using Google Sarwa to get your reply from Quora.com:https:/…Is-TripAdvisor-a-social-mediaBear in mind that Quora is really no different to Yahoo Answers, with opinions from regular people rather than authoritative replies from credible sources. And unfortunately the response you found was from 2017 so you are basing your response on incorrect data. In September 2018 TripAdvisor firmly established itself as a social media website and App.Like social media it relies on user generated content, you can follow other members, see their feeds, it has paid influencers, it relies on advertising, you can message, post photos, follow other users, post opinions, etc.So to state you cannot rely on social media, you are stating that you cannot rely on Tripadvisor, which includes your content.Of course moderators are reinstating your posts because they are not breaching posting guidelines and for no other reason. This is because as Tripadvisor allows you to post opinion. They are not interested in validating what is true or false. I could post that Bali has 5 airports and the locals speak Swahili and the moderators wouldn't care one bit. Like other social media it is up to the reader to determine the truth, and on the forums this is often validated or debunked by other members to help readers decide.Edited: 4:19 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Another ""amazing day"", and the recovery rate increased by the 0.1% from yesterday. You also failed to mention that confirmed cases rose from 490 on 3/6 to 510 on 4/6 ( I am using your data here. If that is true then Bali had one of it's worst days ever.That is what I mean by manipulating data. Cherry picking to suit your narrative"
"I do not know you know about mailing list or not. There are 2 types of mailing list, one without moderator and the other with moderator. Mailing list with moderator is very good, the administrator will screening your post first, if the post is adequate to be aired, so your post will appear. I cannot say that the mailing list I have joined and Tripadvisor administrators are not capable to screening which ones is true or false. Mailing list with moderator will screen the post, before to be aired, but Tripadvisor examine the deletion, is the deletion is correct or not.I also mentioned The other thing you cannot sell anything as a vendor in your post. How about other social media."
"Calla, certainly I know about you have mentioned. Recovery rate is important for how long a patient will in hospital, so we can predict the hospitals will be full or not. To analyze, we must analyze comprehensive, so the bottom line is important. There are active cases and reprodouction rate of infection and even which area will be green, yellow or maybe even red darker. As I know government nowadays makes the more detail, so we can know Klungkung Regency can handle Covid-19 well."
"Well if you know all of that, then how can you say Bali is doing well? Or no need to worry about Bali. How many of these 20 new cases were from community transmission? All these little things you decide to leave out of your posts creates a false impression. You only seem to add them if they are good results And please stop referring to colours, no one knows what you are talking as we dont have a visual reference."
"You going in for a bit of masochism, Calla? You know Sarwa will never change - we've all tried to explain to him both publicly and privately about how unreadable and unreasearched his posts are, and we've reported him and his posts to the moderators but he keeps coming back with the same old rubbish.The only good thing in replying is that any random visitors will know by all our comments that Sarwa's posts are suspect (if they can work out what he's saying) and take no notice of them. Otherwise just let him post his twaddle here to his little heart's content, it seems to make him happy and it might keep him out of other posts."
"Sorry Sarwa but I don't understand your post about mailing lists at all. If a post is removed by the community then moderators will examine it's removal and reinstate if appropriate. Also members can write to the moderators to request reinstatement. There are no mailing lists involved. And while members aren't allowed to advertise in forum posts, advertising is certainly a huge part of TripAdvisor, the same as other social media websites.This is the difference between experience and Googled information."
"All good Mel. I usaully ignore him, but as you say sometimes it helps to challenge his dishonesty, so new visitors won't be sucked in by his lies."

"On June 5, 2020 Bali has 524 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 369. The recovery rate is 70.4 percent. The new cases jump by 14, but overall is still good because Bali nowadays is number 13, below North Sumatra.Accumulative there are 152 medical doctors, nurses, staff administrations and securities in one hospital in West Nusa Tenggara got positive of Covid-19. Possibility the infection happen when opened hazmat, but not properly done, because there are 28 steps must be done. More than 40 have been recovered. Nowadays West Nusa Tenggara is number 10. With East Java, both are neighbour of Bali."

"On June 6, 2020 Bali has 557 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 371. The recovery rate is 66.6 percent. Drop significantly, due to there are significant jump of 33 new cases. Tabanan has 4 new cases from 21 to 25. 2 of them are medical personnel who take care of migrant workers in a hotel."
"Thanks Sarwa. Good information. How many of these new cases are due to local transmission?Edited: 9:37 am, June 06, 2020 "
"Hi Calla,I think most but JP will break down the figures tomorrow on FB. There was another group of cruise ship workers who returned to Bali on Friday evening from their ship which docked in Jakarta. They were tested after 5 days quarantine in Jakarta and are now in a 7 day quarantine in Denpasar, but they were bused back and took the ferry, so...There seem to be local clusters and medical personnel are often the source. Cheers"
"Thanks Paulosussex. Yes Jackie will give us the numbers. Not sure why Sarwa's lat post was deleted, as it was factual."
"Related to number 145 and 146. As I know most of it all from local transmission.33 new cases are a lot and the growth rate of new cases is 6.3 percent. Very high and if it frequent happen, it is very serious. I will monitor it for 5 days."
"Hi,Here is JPs reliable data from today’s large increase in cases. “ The 33 new cases in Bali (18 local transmission) are distributed as follows: Non-Bali (10), Buleleng (7), Badung (4), Tabanan (4), Klungkung (3), Denpasar (2), Foreigners (2), and Karangasem (1). https://pendataan.baliprov.go.id/The Task Force said yesterday that the 2 foreigners who tested positive were in the category of domestically imported cases, meaning the infection was brought in from another region in Indonesia. They are now in hospital, but I couldn’t find any information on where they were previously. balipost.com/news/…...htmlThe two new cases in Denpasar are a husband & wife who sell in Pasar Badung, the big public market downtown. They were identified and tested as a result of case tracing – a customer had tested positive previously. The local Task Force has now tested all surrounding vendors in the market and 21 traders who had reactive rapid tests are waiting for their PCR test swab results. http://www.balipost.com/news/2020/06/06/127773/Dua-Pedagang-di-Pasar-Badung...”"
"Thanks Paul. Yes, very reliable as always."
Another 25 cases for Bali day :( Not good news
Monitoring for the next 5 Days Sarwa? Monitoring for who? Why for 5 days? What do you hope to achieve by your monitoring?
"On June 7, 2020 Bali has 582 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 373. The recovery rate is 64.0 percent. Drop significantly again, due to there are significant jump by 25, after yesterday jump by 33 new cases. Or for 2 consecutive days is 58. In 5 consecutive days we can predict, it has achieved the peak or not, however there are maybe another peak."
Lol. 5 consecutive days we can predict You have been predicting since February and each time you have been wrong.
"But Recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia is still valid for overall, but do not compare with provinces with only a few cases. In Indonesia there are a hundred regencies/cities with no case at all, so do not compare with it also. Indonesia is not large mainland, but an archipelago, so it is simple, if want to isolate Bali. Must thinking about effect to other area and Bali itself, because Bali is dependent with Java. In East Nusa Tenggara there are hundreds passengers must be evacuated, after a month in a port by special ship, because there are no regular ship for them."
"On June 8, 2020 Bali has 594 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 377. The recovery rate is 63.4 percent. Drop again, due to today there are 12 new cases. Or for the latest consecutive days is 70. Seems June 6, 2020 is the peak with 33 new cases.Today, Banyuwangi opens 52 tourist sites with Cpvid-19 Health Protocol. And all employees of private companies initial to work normally in Jakarta which is still in PSBB, Large Scale Social Restriction. Economy seems run well, however malls are still closed."
"On June 9, 2020 Bali has 608 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 409. The recovery rate is 67.2 percent. The recovery rate increase again due to there are 14 new cases, but there are also high recovered persons by 32. For the latest 4 consecutive days the new cases is 84.Bad news for Indonesia, today there are new record for new cases with 1,043, and most additional cases in Jakarta with 232, seems Indonesia need more time to open its border, although there are are more than a hundred regencies/cities have no Covid-19 at all and there are more than a hundred regencies/cities have only few cases and ready to run the economy. There are many different conditions from area to another area."
"Sarwa, you are the only one reading your posts...3 in a row. Enough already."
Totally agree with Sue #159Get your true facts from Bali COVID 19 update by Jackie on Facebook SarwaYou make absolutely no sense and post inaccurate misinformation
"32 new cases in Bali, and only 3 new recoveries. A 64% recovery rate. Bali is definitely not opening soon. Seems we haven't seen the peak yet. 1,241 new cases, another new record in Indonesia. Thats what happens when you actually start testing people."
"It would appear that Indonesia is, and has been for some time, the epicentre of Covid-19 in South East Asia.While discipline might be the key, unfortunately discipline hasn't been one of the strong points of Indonesia."
"Also alarming to note, Calla2005, that those 1,241 cases came from a testing base of 5,826 people. While 17,757 tests were conducted, they were only utilised on that 5,826. People are being subjected to multiple tests - including recovering patients, because Indonesia requires 2 negative results in a row to discharge them from hospital. We can only imagine what the real situation would be if the testing was more effectively administered across the population."
"On June 10, 2020 Bali has 640 accumulative Covid-19 and has been recovered 412. The recovery rate is 64.3 percent. The recovery rate decrease a lot again due to there are 32 new cases, but only there are a few recovered persons by 3. For the latest 5 consecutive days the new cases is 116. Whereas who has been recovered is 41. Seems Bali, has achieved its peak. First target is average of new cases - new recovered is not more than 19.Bad news again for Indonesia, today there are new record for new cases with 1,241, seems Bali is better than overall of Indonesia. Seems Bali, has achieved its peak, but overall of Indonesia is not yet."

"So Bali's infection rate increased by 22% in 5 days. Not sure how you can say they have reached their peak. Or do you have some secret power to see into the future?Agreed Bailey, the number of tests is a furphy. The number of people tested tells us the real story."
"Another 19 cases today. I would seem that Bali is on an upward trajectory. Interesting that the death reported by Jackie this morning has not been included in the latest update. Disturbingly for Bali, the majority of cases have come from community transmission and not PMI's. The Denpasar market cluster is a real cause for concern"
"Another bad day for Bali. A record 36 cases One wonders about the idiots who crammed into Old Man's a few days ago. But that's Canggu and it's instagram fools.What's your take on the new peak Sarwa, and Bali doing well?"
