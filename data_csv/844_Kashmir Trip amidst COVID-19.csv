"Hi All, My Kashmir trip is already planned for March end. My mother, sister and 2.4 year old niece will be travelling with me. How safe is it to travel to Kashmir now amidst COVID-19 pandemic? Pls suggest. I'm worried as I have a toddler with me. And Kashmir is relatively cooler than rest of India in March end. Thanks!"
"Dear TravelerAs of now kashmir is safe from coronovirus, as not any positive patient has been declared, you can plan as usual, don't worry enjoy your holidays in Kashmir Thanks Nissar Wani"
Not a single case of covid-19 positive in kashmirAfter recent ban on foreign tourists the risk to getting exposed is also reduced
But the risk lies in reaching to Kashmir from our places. As airports are the most vulnerable areas.
"Two weeks is an eternity when talking epidemics. So far two cases in Jammu , three in Leh , and pilgrims from Iran & Mecca returning ... The long incubation period adds to the problem. The responsible thing now is to refrain from holiday travel . I would be underwhelmed if the government soon takes this responsibilty out of the hands of vacationers , and restrict non vital travel ."
Thanks :)
"I agree with Vistet. When our government has advised everyone from undertaking unnecessary travel, best to heed their advisory. Any loss due to cancelled bookings is preferable to the risk of contracting the disease. In any case, with the rapidly changing scenario, who can predict that Ladakh may not shut down altogether. If that happens when you are there, that will be an additional stress."
"Dear Traveler,Kindly postpone your travel plans for the time being.RegardsSunny"
