"The first 2 cases of COVID-19 on AXA have been confirmed. Island on lock down starting at noon tomorrow, 03.27."
Gov's announcement:https:/…I hope our little island can get through this.
27 year old female US citizen arrived on island on March 11. Was (guest?) at Four Seasons. May have attended Moonsplash.
"27 yr old female = girlfriend of Mr. Jose Adames, GM of The Four Seasons. They are the 2 cases....."
IF........and again IF all the above is true I can barely fathom the depths of irresponsible reasoning as to WHY these two decided upon their rendezvous at this time.....given that way back in February we had the French couple detained on St. Martin due to COVID 19 possibilities. Very sad. I pray for all the people of Anguilla.....Stay strong.
Jose Adams posted a video on FB.
Can someone please post a link to the video? I can't seem to find it. Thanks!

There's a link to the audio on the FB page for Times Caribbean.

"The extent of the COVID-19 spread in NYC was unknown on March 11. de Blasio didn't even start imposing restrictions until March 12, and at that date there were less than 100 confirmed cases in NYC.. I give this guy a lot of credit for going public now."

"Why are they censoring everything about the Four Seasons GM and his girlfriend from NY being Ground Zero for AXA? Regardless of whether she was unaware of the fact that COVID-19 was a health threat, she brought the virus to AXA; I am hoping that they stayed away from everyone before becoming symptomatic."

"<< “ The extent of the COVID-19 spread in NYC was unknown on March 11. ” >>That’s not exactly true. On March 7th the Governor had declared a state of emergency. On the 10th the National Guard had been deployed in nearby New Rochelle. By the 11th SUNY and CUNY system across the city and state had suspended classes. And anyone on the ground in NYC on the 11th only needed to look at the news from Italy, UK, Spain, etc to see what the next week would bring.https:/…Edited: 8:07 pm, March 27, 2020 "
"Anyone but deBlasio, apparently. 20-20 hindsight for the doomsdayersHopefully the virus has not yet spread widely in Anguilla, and that the public announcement helps in that regard."
Deblasio on March 11th tweeted to not worry about the virus and go about your lives. In the same tweet he even recommended a movie that everyone might enjoy. On the same day HHS officials from NYC were encouraging everyone to attend the parade and festivities in China Town.
"Deblasio was certainly a bit slow on the draw, especially with school closings. But on the 11th NYC announced that the St Patrick’s Day Parade was cancelled... what parade and festivities in Chinatown was the city encouraging people to attend on the 11th?nytimes.com/2020/03/11/nyregion/new-york-st-…Edited: 9:41 pm, March 27, 2020 "
The upcoming Chinese New Year celebration and parade. Didn’t say it was on that particular date just the officials promoting on that date. Three or four city execs in fact.
"Just stop! Do you actually think the girlfriend knowingly came to Anguilla with the virus? I believe the virus has been on island for sometime, since it was discovered in SXM and was brought over from there. There are 70 ppl in quarantine; that should tell you that there are other cases. Stop pointing fingers and placing blame, I am sure everyone involved feels terrible about this and kudos to Jose for stepping up. Prayers for Anguilla."
"Ellen you are right. I am not sure of NYC timeline, but the evening of Mar 11 was when this whole mess began to sink in for me. But on March 14 I was still having a “conversation” with the local air b&b owners about my travels occurring. At that time I was not being persuaded to stay home. I live for my anguilla time. I also am a med tech running these tests. My conscience was eating away at me thinking I would need to be tested before flying. Finally on the 17th I threw in the towel. So it took me a week from the 11th to know the severity of possibly exposing them. I don’t think this pair is the only source importing corona there as it spreads like wild fire. He took personal responsibility by making the statement!"
70 people in quarantine here on Anguilla? Is this the current number of pending test results? Where can we find these figures?Does this include the number of people who has returned to the island?  I know of students who returned home from US and UK who were put into self isolation by their parents. There are also a number (I was told 60 however that may not be correct) of villa owners arrived and went straight into self isolation . One restaurant is very busy delivering dinners to some of them.
"Yes, 72 in quarantine, showing no symptoms.The figures are on the daily 33 Beaches FB post:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php…The fact remains that neighboring islands have the virus, DR has over 500 cases and there are many people from the DR on AXA, SXM has confirmed cases, people were traveling back and forth every day before the lockdown; to say Jose's GF brought in the virus, is pure speculation, as no one knows for sure where or when it arrived on the island."
"Thanks Ellen, Very informative link.72 quarantine at home and4 in quarantine facility .(under health authoritiy supervision I have been told)Edited: 8:24 am, March 28, 2020 "
"Thank you RJP-NJ....at least one person here with a sense of reality. The truth is there for those that wish to see it. I have no time to debate timelines....nor does anyone with sensibility. I live in NY and people had begun leaving weeks ago and just now it's being made public. While I don't place specific solitary blame on Mr. Adames and his girlfriend....they both knew full well what they were doing. To add insult to injury here we have a GM of one of the most popular and populated resorts on Anguilla... The Four Seasons. A position that holds...or should hold a higher sense of responsibility. He....above ANYONE else should have known better. His arrogance and total disregard for the elderly guests on site as well as that of the countless others on Meads Bay and the entire island of Anguilla is beyond belief. There is something called common sense, decency, responsibility and respect for your fellow man. Mr. Adames and his girlfriend are a drastic and utter fail here......no matter how the ""forgiving"" ones here spout off and try to spin it that Mr. Adames is some sort of ""hero"" for making a statement......most of which revolved around his universe...taking no blame and stating no sincere apology to the people of Anguilla for his lapse of better judgement.. Their selfishness and utter stupiditiy is beyond belief....and NO I do not turn the other cheek when people's conscious actions put others very health and possible life in harms way.."
There is something called common sense they say Then they go about doing exactly the opposite of what Ellen has requested. Not exactly what I’d call common sense. What I don’t get is why so many need someone to blame. As I said prior if the mayor of NYC on the same day she went to Anguilla said go to the movies and ignore the virus why is she to blame? This is the time to unite together and not try to attack each other. Stay safe everyone
"Amen Brian. Anyone could have been the ONE to introduce covid to the island. I make a damn hard honest living as a clinical microbiologist. My original booking to visit was March 3. Changed to a later time for non Covid reason. I could have introduced it. I live in a neighborhood 70% Chinese origin. My work peers have the mindset “we all have IT” now, but on March 3 that wasn’t the case. Maybe all Health Care workers need to be permanently banned from travel huh? Please everyone stop! Be grateful you aren’t on the frontlines! This is not an us or them event. Yes Cape Cod Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are upset city”Summer People” have retreated to their vacation homes! Are they selfish? They pay mega taxes for their property. Or are the locals selfish in their attitude. Leave well enough alone!"
"On a positive note: A huge THANK-YOU to The Four Seasons, 57th Street, New York City...For donating thier rooms for all NYC Doctors, Nurses and healtcare workers on the front lines in NYC"
"There is no proof that she was the first carrier of the virus in Anguilla. She was the first to test positive and nothing more. Everything else is speculation. If you need to blame somebody, blame the virus and not the people. We're all in this together."
"And if that is correct, where is this virus spreader now then?"
Please! Stop targeting people. They are not intentionally spreading it. They were exposed and not that enlightened on aseptic habits. We are only human
Lockdown officially extended through April 21st.
"Extended to May 12, with some limited exceptions. Seems overly cautious."
