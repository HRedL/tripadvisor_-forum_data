I know there have been many postings about Italy and the Plague. Might someone from Italy provide us with an update from your unique perspective?thank you in advance
I'm bored. Really bored. That's about the worst of it right now.
Ann:lastraniera gave an update a few hours ago in this other thread. See post #2.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g19483…
See post No 2 in this thread by lastraniera: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g194…mesh
Thank you. I did not see this thread. I love Italy and hope that it will recover and what they learned is transmitted to all of us.
"Well something I just read is disconcerting. Not about Italy, but could affect them of course, as well as all of us. I hated reading this.https:/…h_5fa6905b7b9aa8dd59305694147d605f"
"are you asking about a personal input on the situation in Italy from someone on the ground due to the virus or travel-related question?Edited: 5:11 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"@7 I wanted to give my answer on the question I was not clear, current updates on Italy are on Aljazeera news or the BBC news channel or watch youtube videos."
"Hi Ann B,lastraniera's described life in a small Tuscan town that hasn't been significantly impacted by the virus. Her entry was a joy to read.It's not so easy for those in cities, and for those quarantined in the initial red zone since February. And then also those of us who have sustained personal losses.https:/…106378057My empathy also to those worldwide now so negatively impacted by this pandemic.Vagabonda"
"I asked TA moderators about not travel related posts.This is an unprecedented time, and nothing including our forum is typical.Even non-travel related posts are providing a source of information.Vagabonda"
I think that part of being a traveler is becoming knowledgeable about an area and thus developing an appreciation for the region and the people. I would like to know how the Plague has impacted ordinary folk and their families.
Back at you Larry!V.
"""A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"".Call it what you'd like,; a plague, a virus, a pandemic, Covid-19.....But let's not get so flippant as they all kill.La Grippe, the 1918ish flu, the Spanish flu wasn't mentioned.It killed my great grandfather.Vagabonda"
"“I think that part of being a traveler is becoming knowledgeable about an area and thus developing an appreciation for the region and the people. I would like to know how the Plague has impacted ordinary folk and their families.”Irrespective of what it is officially known as, this is a good, genuinely travel-related question and is our approach to travel too. As important as it is to read up in advance on sights to see, what to eat, opening times, etc, learning about the culture (ancient and modern day), politics, history of a place is equally as essential. Perhaps even more so."
The historic plague was the black plague. There are still plague infections running around the world. It's not ancient history it's just not the current issue.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plagueBacteria not virus.
"Couldn't help noticing that in his press briefing last night, the US President referred to Covid-19 as ""the plague""."
"Not ""The Chinese Plague""? He must be going soft."
"It gets better. Apparently the reason Italy was hit so hard by the virus is that he closed the borders to Chinese people so they had to come here instead. Truly, watch it for yourself on YouTube, last night's election rally cum press briefing, that statement comes very near the end. Best entertainment around."
"If I watch him. I can't believe the things that come out of his mouth.It would be funny, if it wasn't so so sad."
"If you want sad, wait until November"
I hate when we go political but these are different times ..yes the US leader is not..a leader. Lies too...ok back to dreaming about being in Toscana ...be safe be strong
"My daughter was studying in Florence until March 11th, came home to California, 2 weeks in quarantine and has been sheltered in place ever since. I suspect there may be more COVID-19 here than in Florence. We did tell her we will take her back to visit Florence when this is over so our interest is actually travel related."
"Population of Metropolitan Florence is around 1 m and there were 2,704 cases as of yesterday. Not sure how that compares with where you are but I suspect the lock-down here is far tighter. It's very hard for people in Florence, the few I know who are still there are finding it very difficult indeed. The restrictions are tough and strictly enforced to the extent that drones are used to ""patrol"" the streets. With all that plus you'd probably be worried stiff, your daughter is no doubt better off where she is now safe at home with family."
"Well, you see what is happening in some cities here in america..Californians know the consequences here, at least most do...we have no intention to “liberate California “ until ready and safe. I really believe the Italians are a prime example how to attack this virus , bravo Italia .."
"Larry, I so agree. I look at my hometown, London, and I tell you I’m scared for everyone there so all credit to our government here in Italy for doing what it takes to keep us all safe. The strict lock-down, masks and especially the horribly sweaty latex gloves certainly take a bit of getting used to but human beings adapt, it’s a survival instinct, and if it’s that or catching the virus, it’s a no brainer. Oh and social distancing is something I hope we have forever. It is so nice not having someone breathing down your neck at the cold meat counter."

"I'm just quoting what your President said, last few minutes of his ""press briefing"" 19th April. And be careful what you say about our health care system here."
"""poor healthcare system"" - good grief. Seems someone's been listening to our propaganda channel here in the states.We can only imagine having as a good a healthcare system here in the states - Silly stuff is going around in an effort to place blame, etc during this tragic time. It's such a sad waste of little grey cells. But, some folks just need to blame others or find conspiracies littered everywhere."
"Apologies about the healthcare comment, I was wrong (unable to delete it). Just defending your blaming the US stopping China travel on the Italian outbreak."
"Paradores102:>>unable to delete it<<No - you can delete it. If you are on a desktop or laptop, it is easy. Go to the post. Underneath your text is a ""Report inappropriate content"" link. Click on that and a dropdown box will appear. Select ""Remove my Post"""
"the Italian government did not move fast on the various when they were notified by the WHO also like Spain and France and the USA then they got caught behind the 8 ball, its true about the Chinese rag trade factories in the north of Italy a lot of Italians have lost their jobs over the years due to this more than 3 quarters of Chinese workers are not legal to stay in Italy that are working in those rag factories it's a grey area the Italian government says it's ok.Edited: 10:54 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"Paradores102>>AND THAT'S WHY ITALY WAS HIT SO HARD. Plus it's poor healthcare system,<<A good portion of your post is incorrect based on the current investigative work of tracking down the virus origins in Italy. Of course, the findings may change with further research, but it is currently believed that Italy's Patient Zero and Patient One have absolutely nothing to do with what you have written. And then making the second comment that Italy has a poor healthcare system just illustrates that you haven't really read much about this topic at all."
Why let the truth get in the way of an argument? #D. Trump.
"And just to clarify, you misunderstand completely, in my post #23 I merely quoted something the US President said the night before and I was being ironic. I’m not blaming anyone, I have no idea why Italy was hit so hard, that’s for the experts to determine."
"Many of us are embarassed by our current President of the United States. I for one am using and will continue to use the advice of scientists and doctors to help me make decisions. With that said, many of us are eager to visit our beloved Italy and hope that when it opens up for tourists we will be welcomed and we will feel safe."
Hi Ann...I am more than embarrassed...I can’t even find the words in my mouth that truly represent how I feel about our current administration as there doesn’t seem to be anything strong enough. May Italy (and the world) continue to be strong during this terrible pandemic.
"I can only speak for myself and my friends but we are so grateful to have the strong, clear guidance of the current Italian government, an administration (like those of France and Spain) that isn’t afraid to make difficult decisions that may not always, on the face of it, appear popular. For this isn’t the time to be popular, this is the time to put people’s lives before comfort and certainly before economics. The weather’s warming up and it’s becoming increasingly uncomfortable having to wear that pesky face mask all the time when we go out. I’m extra cautious always and wear those sweaty latex gloves too. When so many have died, social distancing is simply a no-brainer, you just do it. Irrespective of what your specific government may decree, stay home, stay safe, and if you must go out for essentials, masks, gloves and keeping your distance always. You only have to look at your beloved Italy to see that this is the way to fight it."
"Lastraniera- Grazie for another inspiring post. I have read your posts and find them encouraging and straightforward. A year ago today, we landed at FCO. La prima volta in Italia per celebrare la pensione. What an amazing and wonderful trip!! We were hoping to return in the Fall but will wait until the world has healed. Chester and Ann- I agree with you. How embarrassing that the VP toured the Mayo Clinic and did not wear a mask. To all on the Forum- stay safe and healthy."
"@NewYorkelana thank you. The photograph of Pence at the Mayo Clinic went viral world-wide. I don't understand why taking simple precautions at a time like this is interpreted by some as a sort of weakness or is it, heaven forbid, arrogance? Whatever, I really and truly don't get it ..."
"@47 he was going was his ""boss"" wanted. I so wish the patient in that photo had asked him to leave. He could have done so based on no mask. Protocol in any medical facility let alone Mayo Clinic is face mask....I bet if Mayo could get a do-over they would not let him go in there without the mask. That said...Rochester Mn. is big DJT territory !!"
"Yesterday, a British friend in Florence was telling me how orderly everything is. She had gone to the supermarket, where there are facilities to disinfect your hands before you enter and the store provides everybody with gloves. Of course everybody was wearing a mask, and everybody respected the rules about distancing.At our supermarket in the States, no hand-washing, no gloves, no nothing. And a huge percentage of people do not wear a mask and do not pay a whole lot of attention to how close they get to others.As for the wretched Mr. Pence: He obviously does not understand that the primary reason you wear a mask is to ensure that you don't infect others. And his ludicrous excuse was that he wanted to ""see"" the people. Even the Lone Ranger's mask has openings for his eyes."
"In case it hasn't been mentioned amid all the politics, Florence and Ciampino are planned to open next week"
"anglital:Please define ""are planned to open"".For example, my understanding is that Peretola will reopen next Monday -- with a new, rather serious system for screening all passengers. When I flew out of Peretola last, in mid-March, there was no screening whatsoever."
"Let's get back to the purpose of a travel forum.Does anyone have a favorite ""top 3"" wineries to visit while traveling the Route 222 (Chianti Road) traveling south of Florence?We're doing some REALLY long-range planning for another trip."
Actually the original post reflected a desire to know ‘the conditions on the ground’ and the political is a part of that discussion..... I do agree threads have a habit of getting off track and especially during this uncertain time but there are opportunities to start new posts for more traditional travel discussions.
"Very much so but otherwise - Too many vineyards to mention and you can't go wrong at any big or small but perhaps detour off the road at Greve to Antinori (superb wines, an unforgettable tour). On the road further south, Fontodi. Detour at Castellina to Ricasoli (great tours, good wines, beautiful place). Back on the road just south of Castellina heading to Siena, Fonterutoli."
"Triple Time:Post whatever questions or comments you wish. Please recognize that others have the same right, and only TA has the right to censor.As for visiting wineries, if you're looking for beautiful places along the road, that's one thing. If you're looking to buy wine, that's something quite different. And, in either case, getting anywhere near alcohol while driving in Italy is an exceptionally bad idea."
And starting a new thread with this subject line will ensure you receive a better range of responses.

Points well taken. I have posted in the Tuscany Forum.
"I was reading an article recently on Alitalia's operations during the crisis, a network that includes a good number of domestic as well as a handful of international routes. I noticed that Florence wasn't included but presumably it will be from next week when some internal travel restrictions are lifted to a small degree. I know from talking to friends around the world that in some parts, ""Italy"" has become synonymous with a sick, unhealthy place but, frankly, we couldn't feel more safe and secure. The terrifying way the virus took hold here really bred a strong sense of personal responsibility in people and a simple acknowledgement that the rigid regulations the government has put in place must be adhered to. Curiously, despite the tightness of the lock-down, I know a number of people who aren’t in any hurry to rush back to their place of work, and it’s not just because home-working has proved so effective, especially for professionals. No, they are still afraid. And for us, and several of our friends, even when things do open up more locally, we may not immediately rush off out of the house and embrace the old life. This is hard to explain but I'm not altogether sure if all of us are psychologically ready for it.Edited: 12:36 am, May 01, 2020 "
"A wonderful post, M.!I have re-posted it on my FB page x"
"lastraniera: what you describe in your post #60 is likely happening all over the world; it is certainly the case with everyone I know.I don't, however, think it is difficult to explain why so many feel fearful or uneasy about just going about life again - There is no cure, we don't have a clue as to the virus' life cycle yet, we don't know if a vaccine will be forthcoming sooner than later (or, if at all), we don't know if we can get it again (as we can get the flu over and over), etc - it is all the unknowns. Nothing has actually changed. The spread (from everything I have read from health professionals) has slowed because people isolated - so, I'm not eagerly waiting to pounce back into my previous life until more is actually known. I am - as a New Yorker living in a building - just so wanting to walk outside my front door and be outside vs. having to run a gauntlet with other tenants in hallways and elevators - This is something I never dreamed would present an issue to just getting some fresh air. I hope to never take that ability of ease of access to the outside for granted in future."
