"Hi,I just made a mistake on booking the hotel via Booking.com.I want to cancel the reservation but found out later that it is a non-refundable.I do understand about the terms and condition but this is my mistake : (Does anyone has the same experience?what should I dothank you"
"Hello,There is already a topic on that a little bit further down the first page of this forum -tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-i12334-k6976…Unfortunately, if you chose and booked a non-refundable hotel on any website then ""non-refundable"" means just that. People often have the choice to booked the cheaper non-refundable deal, or often a slightly higher priced one offering Free Cancellation up until a specific time and date before arrival. Yes, it was obviously a mistake that you didnt see/notice or read the bit about it being non-refundable. Their Terms and Conditions will be very clear about non-refundable and its meaning.You can cancel it if you wish, but you will not receive a refund. I think its the hotels themselves who set the rules for their hotels deals, either non-refundable or Free Cancellation. You could try contacting booking.com, but be prepared for them to say its non-refundable and they can not do anything for you."
"Thank you Avanti50,Actually I called Booking.com office in Thailand and told them about my mistake.They are very helpful and help me contact the hotel and finally, I am able to cancel the reservation without any cost.Lucky me, if anyone also did the same mistake, call booking.com in your country.Anyway, be careful to read T&C is the best way !"
That was extremely lucky. That's good service from both booking.com and your hotel. I agree about the importance of reading the T and C.
"Yes, it appears that Booking.com have provided good service here by helping you to sort this out. Still, I'm sure that won't stop those who think that Booking.com are unhelpful, unreliable cheats and liars from saying so, lol!"
"Actually I had the same situation I called booking.com and explain to them that I cancelled my visit to Manchester (my destination) they called the hotel and helped me cancelling the non refundable reservation.in my opinion, I believe booking.com is a good and reliable website"
"That was very good of Booking,com. Did you get any money back from the hotel?"
"I have had two situations in recent years where we have had to cancel non-refundable rooms through booking.com. Just this March, we had a return flight to Hong Kong diverted away from Brussels to Amsterdam due to the airport being closed, the other being the result of a death in the family that altered our travel schedule a few years back. In both cases, I notified the hotel and booking.com of the cancellation so that the room could be added back to their available inventory in cased other travellers were in need of the rooms. I informed on both occasions that I understood and accepted that the reservation was nonrefundable and this was not a problem. Interestingly enough, on both occasions, I was refunded by the hotel. Booking.com staff were friendly in the facilitation and all communication between BC, the hotel and myself was amicable and calm. In the end, I was surprised to receive a refund on both occasions as it was not asked for with either. Why Booking.com went through the trouble and why the hotels provided the refunds? I can only speculate that it was due to being polite, patience, calm and reasonable. In return, both hotels and booking.com responded in-kind. These are two personal experiences and compelling reasons why Booking.com is a strong first-choice hotel booking website for me now."
"I had a more complicated issue with one (3 nights) may charge me cancellation of Euro 60 (with semi cancellation policy) and another one I booked 4 nights (non-refundable) as I want to replace the first one I booked due to one extended night. (the first reservation didn't have the extra day available that was why I booked 2nd property for the total four nights in prague.Luckily, my credit card was on held, so the second property couldn't charge me full amount. After I phoned booking.com a few times, only one girl is soooooooooo nice and patient and helped me solving this issue by adding one additional night from the first property as they can see from their end whether there's availability or not. The previous 2 or three booking.com people didn't suggest me with these options. So She helped me avoid the penalty charge, extended one more night with my original booking and canceled the non-refundable property as it passed 48 hours (with credit card invalid).If you have any issues with booking.com,, phone them. if one couldn't solve the problem phone again. I'm so happy that I don't need to stress over these charges and able to stay at the right place at a lower costs.Edited: 4 years ago "
I have booked a non refundable hotel in Dubai with booking.com for an over night stopover en route to Sydney in September Qantas just sent me an email to say i am entitled to a complimentary overnight stopover where do I call booking .com to try get their help to cancel ?
You will have a link in your booking confirmation email to enable you to manage your booking.Though you have said that you have booked a non refundable hotel.......
"You would find booking.com contact details on their website, and also on the emailed confirmation they sent you when you booked the hotel. Since you booked a non-refundable hotel deal in Dubai and want to cancel it. You should be able to cancel it through booking.com but won't get any refund. The terms and conditions of the 'non-refundable' deal you agreed to would state that hotels cancellation policy."
"I don't believe these replies here. I had a similar problem of mistakenly selecting wrong dates on non-refundable room. I realized my mistake the moment I clicked confirm and got the confirmation screen. I called booking.com first, and explained to them the problem, the guy on from booking.com explained that it is a hotel policy and the hotel has the final word. He offered me to call the hotel on my behalf while I am holding on the line. Few minutes passed by and he came again and said that the hotel refused to refund the charge. I argued a little but he insisted that it is hotel policy so I asked him the number of the hotel and the person in charge. I called the hotel and talked to that person who rudely refused to cooperate and turned all my begging away. I continued to beg him and his answer was that he is not the manager and I should call again another day hoping to get the manager (he refused to specify when I can get the manager)! So I called another day to the hotel and a lady answered the phone, with no less rudeness in talking to me, she turned me away and said she is not the manager and handed me to a man who claimed to be the manager. He told me there is no refund even if I am calling 5 days before the date of the reservation. After arguing with him a little, he told me ""do whatever you want to do, there is no refund""! I called back to booking.com and requested to talk to a manager, they transferred me to a manager who offered no solution and repeated the statement that ""do whatever you want to do"". I think that all those answers from people who claimed that booking.com helped them resolve this issue are just writing on behalf of booking.com to appeal to more customers to choose their services, in other words they are hired reviewers paid to praise booking.com"
Check and check again before hitting the book button....especially on non-refundable bookings.Edited: 4 years ago 
Obviously some hotels are more flexible and dont enforce their no refund policy on non-refundable bookings and some hotels wont budge and will not allow refunds on non-refundable bookings.
"""I think that all those answers from people who claimed that booking.com helped them resolve this issue are just writing on behalf of booking.com to appeal to more customers to choose their services, in other words they are hired reviewers paid to praise booking.com""The problem you had seemed to be that you booked a non refundable rate then expected booking.com to make the hotel refund you. From what you describe, they tried their best for you to communicate with the hotel but everything you describe indicates that the hotel was being unhelpful to you by enforcing a policy they the hotel set. The people who say booking.com helped them had the same help you had, putting them in touch with the hotel, asking the hotel to waive the policy, but they were lucky and had a sympathetic hotel owner who agreed. Nothing to do with booking.com. They helped them and you in exactly the same way, you were just unlucky eight to book a non refundable rate in a hotel which wouldn't budge! And as for saying that anyone who sticks up for booking.com is a hired reviewer.....well just wait and see what others have to say. Completely stupid!"
"Morgantown_2, Your reservation mistake is unfortunate. This happens at times and is something you can chalk up to bad luck and try to learn from. Your issue with the hotel not offering you a refund or change of dates also unfortunate. It stinks when hotels don't cooperate or act in good faith. Your rant against booking.com indicates that you don't grasp that your reservation contract is with the hotel directly, not booking.com. You seem to also fail to understand that booking.com attempted to help you when they were not obliged to do so. This is an act of good faith and a practice by better businesses. From what you describe, I would say - Good job and effort on behalf of booking.com to provide additional (added-value) service to a user of their website platform facility. Your rant against forum posters who have had good experiences with booking.com and didn't end up with as poor a result with a hotel as you is really not called for. It is petulant and poor forum, not the stuff of mature adults I'm afraid. Your suggestion that forum posters who have had good experiences means they work for booking.com is profoundly ridiculous, like your hotel is written in utterly bad faith and completely discredits your entire post. I felt sympathetic for you and your situation until you wrote that nonsense. In the end, you seem to be lashing out at any and everyone. Don't be such a sore loser, Morgantown_2. It is not befitting of anyone and nobody here cares to read stuff like this."
">>>I think that all those answers from people who claimed that booking.com helped them resolve this issue are just writing on behalf of booking.com to appeal to more customers to choose their services<<<See, the thing about statements like that, can work in both directions. So how would it sound, if others said that we don't believe any complaints, it must have been written up by competitors if Booking.com, trying to sway them away from using their services?Edited: 4 years ago "

Especially so given your own experience in which you found when calling the hotel yourself how unaccommodating they were. Booking.com must of had the same response from the hotel when they tried to help and call on your behalf.Your issue is with the hotel and the (perhaps) rudeness of their staff - or, perhaps with yourself for messing the booking up in the first place. Not with Booking.com."
"Morgantown2, have you been hired and paid to criticise Booking.com?You made a mistake. Booking,.com tried to help but couldn't get anywhere. Neither could you. It's the hotel's decision, ultimately.

"I just had the complete opposite experience from many on this sting. I specifically filtered for Free Cancellation hotels, I made 2 reservations for Refundable rooms. I was caresful to chose Refundable, not sure what happened but I was booked at non-refundable rates. I only had the reservations for 5 days, before we decided that we would not take the trip and cancelled the reservations. My credit card was charged the full amount of the stay for both $7,000. I called Bookings for assistance, they simply read the T&C policy and pushed me over to the Hotels. The hotels also read the T&C and offered to allow me to book on another date within a year. I don't have future plans to visit London, so that doesn't help me. I'm out $7,000 and very sick to my stomach."
"@Coralie P<<<I made 2 reservations for Refundable rooms. I was caresful to chose Refundable, not sure what happened but I was booked at non-refundable rates. >>>Even when using the refundable filter, you will see available hotels with all types of booking conditions. It simply means that you will not see hotels which offer ZERO refundable hotels. When viewing the room types, you will still be able to select (correctly or not) refundable or nonrefundable booking class rooms. It seems like you made a mistake at this stage. Ouch! But did you really make the same mistake twice? <<<My credit card was charged the full amount of the stay for both $7,000.>>>Two reservations for a total of 5 nights that cost you $7000? Wow, what hotel are you booked at? Sounds like you are a luxury traveler - picking accommodations in this price range. If you can afford this price of hotel rooms and have up to a year to postpone your booking, surely a flight to London, one of the best cities in the world for all around sightseeing, can be in the cards over the next 12 months, right?"
"Not exactly, only intended to keep one, after I had a chance to review with my husband, hence booking Refundable. Five days is how long from when I booked and cancelled."
hey i am needing to change accomadation at the moment who do i call first? thankyou in advance.
"Spinksy7 If this is a Booking.com reservation, go to ""Manage my Booking"" page. You will find option buttons"
"You don't need to call anyone. Go to the Booking.com website and look at your upcoming bookings. If you need to cancel one there will be an option to do that, and it will be clear as to what costs there are to do so.If you are hoping to get a penalty free cancellation on a non refundable rate, you could try contacting the hotel, but to be honest my expectations of getting anywhere would not be high."
"Hi I have the same situation, can you give me advice about it..."
Have you read through the many replies on this topic? What exactly is the problem you are having?
"No one knows who you are addressing, giorgichigvinadze. We can try and help but we need you to help us, too!"
"Did you try going to your credit card company about it? These web sites arbitrarily change the dates you entered to the next dates of availability. Yes, it's lack of oversite on the part of the customer but I feel it's a deceptive business practice."
">>>These web sites arbitrarily change the dates you entered to the next dates of availability.<<<I must confess this is not something I've noticed. Some sites do default back if you leave the page and then return, but in my view that isn't the same thing you're describing."
">>>These web sites arbitrarily change the dates you entered to the next dates of availability<<<These? I believe you are collectively talking about all OTA, which isn't an accurate explanation because they are all very different. And it's not fair to generalise when this thread is referring to one particular OTA. There is simply nothing deceptive about Booking.com.In all the years I've been using Booking.com, as well as being on the other side, I cannot recall an instance where the guests have legitimately had a wrong date issue.Well there are some claims, but many of those are all too obvious, such as correct date wrong month.Edited: 3 years ago "
"<<<<These web sites arbitrarily change the dates you entered to the next dates of availability. Yes, it's lack of oversite on the part of the customer but I feel it's a deceptive business practice.>>>>This doesn't happen at all with booking.com. If you search for hotels by (1.) a city - the search results are shown with hotels that have available rooms as well as those without for those dates only. You simply click on the hotels that have rooms and choose room type. If you instead search for (2.) a specific hotel - the search results will begin with the hotel you inputed, followed by other similar properties. If the hotel you asked about isn't available, you receive a message like the following [We are sold out on your dates: Sun XX Nov 2016 - Mon XX Nov 2016 (1 night)]. You are then shown 3-4 click boxes with alternative dates that you can choose for that specific hotel when they do have available rooms. However, at no time does booking.com arbitrarily change dates for those searching for rooms. You have to enter new/different dates or click the suggested dates option if the property you are interested in doesn't have rooms on the date you have asked for. It is that easy and that simple."
">>>at no time does booking.com arbitrarily change dates for those searching for rooms. You have to enter new/different dates or click the suggested dates option if the property you are interested in doesn't have rooms on the date you have asked for.<<<That's absolutely right according to my own experience, and I've used Booking.com a lot. I can bounce around from page to page and my search dates have always remained the same."
"I had a similar situation where I booked through booking.com and I knew it was a non-refundable room. I had a family emergency 3 days before check in. I called booking.com and notified them to see what were my options and they were very nice as well and they said that the reservation was cancelled. They sent me an email verifying it was cancelled. Then the Sheraton charged me 100 dollars more than original charge of 423. ($525) I called Sheraton and they told me to call Booking.com. Booking.com said that my cancellation was that of the reservation only. It is a non cancelable reservation. They said because I was a loyal client (their typical line) that they would call the Sheraton and see if they can reverse the charges. (I'm pretty sure they didn't even call) They called me back saying it was a nonrefundable booking. I said great now give me the name of the person you talked with at the Sheraton and or give me a reference number (crickets) they gave me nothing. The issue with this is that the email stated that the reservation was cancelled for 423 dollars meaning that the reservation was terminated with a fee of 423 which is the full price of the room. The issue is in the wording. You cannot cancel a non cancelable room. You should not be getting an email saying that your reservation has been cancelled when, in fact, you are still paying the full amount of the room. So, in the end, they said that my cancellation cost was the full price of the 2 nights that I booked with the Sheraton which was 423 dollars and the Sheraton charged me 525 dollars. Booking.com never got back to me to resolve the matter. I will never book with booking.com again and or the Sheraton. STAY AWAY FROM BOOKING.COM."
"Richard BI feel for your situation but cancellable and refundable are two different things. Yes, booking.com is happy to assist you in cancelling your reservation.... but if it was a non-refundable contract (reservation) you had with the hotel, it shouldn't have been surprising that the hotel charged you the agreed fee. Non-refundable means just that - No refund, regardless if you cancel your booking or not. You are still obliged to pay the agreed non-refundable amount as per conditions of your reservation. This is your contract with the hotel even under unfortunate circumstances which you seem to have had."
Richard B #34In this situation your travel insurance would probably have covered you. Have you claimed?
"This is exactly the sort of situation that travel insurance is designed to cover. You can always cancel a reservation, whether you will get a refund or not is entirely dependent on the terms of the contract you entered into, and whether the hotel in question wishes to enforce those terms.Booking.com are not involved in the payment, nor the refund. I can't see what they have done to deserve your anger, to be honest. The site is a platform for making reservations, and as such, it's a platform for cancelling them as well. Everything else is down to the hotel, and as you were aware that the booking was non refundable, I'm not at all sure what you expected to happen."
"I agree with everything stated, that it appears to be a case of not understanding that being able to cancel is not the same as being refundable. None of this has to do with Booking.com.One thing I will add however, is that the hotel should never have told you to call Booking.com, when it is their policy. The fact that they instructed this, just about says it all you need to know about how that hotel operates.Edited: 3 years ago "
"That's a good point, KVE. It seems to be another example of a hotel fobbing a guest off to an agent rather than explaining things themselves."
Please help me to cancel the booking due to I've some important issue on that day
"Sasikalanagarajan, Please read previous comments on this thread."
Just I want cancel the booking its my mistake. How can I cancel the booking
"rasad, If you want to cancel a booking you made on www.booking.com, then look on the confirmation email you received from them and see if there is a link to manage your booking, or look on their website and cancel it on there. If you booked a non-refundable deal then you can cancel, but won't get a refund. But if you booked a deal with free-cancellation up until a specific time and date before arrival, and you are still within that cancellation period then you should be able to cancel and receive a refund. All those details and policies will be on the confirmation you received."
"I just made an error in booking via booking.com. I booked a non-refundable room for a wedding I am attending, and as soon as I received the order confirmation I realized I had made an error on the date. I emailed booking.com, and then I sent an email directly to hotel asking for them to cancel so I may re-book. I received an email within a few minutes confirming that my request had been approved. ie. canceled without any fees. I am sure it is because I am attending a wedding at hotel. Bride and Groom have already set aside a block of rooms at hotel."
"I booked with Southall travel, not booking Com to travel to Thailand and Singapore. The total was higher but we paid 500 pounds as part of deposit. After that we had to cancel the booking with them just after christmas they have cancelled the booking but have refused to the return the amount of 500 pounds. What can i do to have refund back.Edited: 3 years ago "
#45. You claim from your travel insurance.
"You paid a deposit. Deposits are generally non refundable. Unless the terms and conditions you read and agreed to stated it was refundable, then you won't get it back from the agent. As Rawtalent says, claim on your insurance, presuming you have insurance, and presuming the reason for cancelling is covered."
"gmahal, for future reference, please start a new thread if your question is unrelated to a topic. In this case you had nothing to do with Booking.com, which is the subject of this thread. You'll probably get more replies with a new thread.I'm not trying to tell you off, by the way, just trying to help you get used to the TA forums :-)Edited: 3 years ago "
I am having this issue myself for over 500.00. I cancelled before 24 hours passed and they won't return my money. The Marriott is telling me I should be contacting Booking.com.I have been pleading with both of them because I feel they are robbing me.When I booked online it was even highlighted that I wouldn't be charged a cancellation fee.I started a dispute with my bank over Marriot Hotel taking my money.I wish you the best!
You haven't said what your issue is Penny C. But It won't be with Booking.com. It will be with Marriott. Did you read the booking terms?
"Penny C, Did you book a cancellable room or a non-refundable room? Do carefully read over the T&C which are available directly on the homepage and in each individual transaction. There you will find that the agreement you have is directly with Marriott, not Booking.com - which is simply the internet platform (like a marketplace) where hotels post their rooms and travellers make reservations."
"Most rooms you pay up front for are non refundable. Some are semi flexible whereby you get charged the first night if you cancel. It's generally the ones whereby you pay on arrival that you can cancel with no charge, providing you do so within the time limits stipulated while you're booking. You need to read the rules for each room carefully."
">>>I cancelled before 24 hours passed and they won't return my money<<<I'm wondering if this matter is an interpretation issue - over the understanding of cancelling 24hrs prior. The reason for the speculation is the 'passed' wording above. The cancellation policy - if it's 24hr cancellation - is 24hrs *prior*, not *within* 24hrs.As an example. If someone booked a 24hr cancellation reservation the day before arrival, it's effectively a non cancellable reservation. That said, it's all speculation until more details are postedEdited: 3 years ago "
"I thin Penny might be thinking that there is a 24 hour cooling off period for all reservations, in which a traveller can cancel without penalty. In my experience using Booking.com in the UK, properties with rates that include free cancellation are very clearly marked. If it doesn't say free cancellation, then I have to assume that it's a rate that requires pre payment and a penalty for cancellation."
"I'm not sure why Penny would think there was a 24 hour cooling off period. It's really clear and usually states, ""no cancellation fee if cancelled before [a specific date]"" rather than saying, ""free cancellation within 24 hours"""
I was thinking that Penny might be one of those people who think that there is a law allowing 24 hours to cancel without penalty. It's all I could think of.
"Hi, I made similar mistake Jan 28, 2017 -- booked wrong dates and faced a unrefundable loss of £700. Got straight on to www.booking.com by email and phone and they contacted the hotel and got the dates changed at no cost. My advice is act quickly, the moment you spot the mistake as hotel will be accommodating (pun intended) if it is an easy change for them to make and they have free rooms on the dates in question. Contact both the hotel and the website you booked through. Customer service from www.booking.com was excellent - really helpful and proactive. Ross"
"I think you're right Ross. Speed is of the essence, though of course it's far better to get it right first time ;-)Booking.com are normally happy to contact a hotel on the customer's behalf, bu it;s always the decision of the hotel. I suspect that most good hotels would not enforce their T&C's stringently if contacted pretty quickly. I've made mistakes myself with dates,a s well as one double booking. I was very pleased that in each the hotels responded positively to my polite request to help me out when I realised my error!Like I say, though, I'd much rather not make a mess of it and not have to ask!"
"I have an issue that I booked a hotel in India that was pay on arrival but I had to enter a card number, they haven't charged my card yet (I checked with the CC and there is no charge or pending charge for booking.com) but I want to cancel it and it is saying 100% cancellation. Via the website they have emailed the hotel and I have to wait 48 hours at the hotels discretion of whether it can be cancelled (it isn't travelling for 3 weeks). My feeling is that if they refuse to cancel it, I should just cancel the card then they have no way to obtain the funds anyway. Would that work?"
"Pay on arrival doesn't necessarily mean that a booking is refundable. Cancelling the card doesn't cancel the contract you've entered into, and it's possible, though perhaps highly unlikely, that the hotel would try and pursue you for the cost of the booking.I feel quite strongly that it's better to behave ethically, just as we would hope that a business would treat us. In that respect, I don't believe it's morally right to try and wriggle out of a booking in this manner simply because your plans have changed for whatever reason. It's entirely your call, though."
"I also called Booking.com regarding my ""non-refundable"" booking. My booking representative called the lodge, spoke to the front desk and they agreed to cancel my reservation for no charge! I believe they were cool with it considering I canceled almost 2 months in advance.Just goes to show..at least try.Good luck everyone. I hope you speak to a nice booking rep and a friendly hotel!"
"I have had non refundable bookings refunded a couple of times when I've made a mistake. Being apologetic and polite is helpful to getting a sympathetic ear in my opinion. It certainly doesn't hurt.At the end of the day, though, I accept that if the answer is no, I only have myself to blame."
"I had completely different experience with booking.com. We had placed the booking for a hotel in Edinburgh (Edinburgh Lodge West End) for 4 nights for the total price 390 euro. Non-refundable. Three days before the check-in date we had learned that the UK visa (EEA Family Permit) application for my wife was still in processing and would not be ready for the date of departure. Tried to call booking.com and the hotel directly. Tried to ask them to reduce the cancellation fee (the full price for 4 nights) or to move the booking dates a little bit ahead (so that we would receive the visa documents back). But all that just in vain. Booking.com, as they claim, tried to speak to the hotel as well but this hotel left no space for any negotiations! The full sum of 390 Euro just lost. I have a feeling that in any case (refundable or non-refundable) there should be set an upper limit to the sum customer could potentially loose, otherwise non-refundable just means ""I caught you, now I legally steal your money"".Edited: 3 years ago "
"If you agreed in principle to the non refundable condition, that is nothing like stealing whatsoever. You knew the conditions upfront. Regardless, this still has nothing to do with Booking.com, as the conditions are set by the hotel, which, once again was agreed to when you booked."
"Arkady S, I have to agree with KVE1005, The situation is unfortunate but as you have pointed out, it is (1) the visa situation that is your real issue, (2) you took the risk by making non-refundable reservations before visa was obtained and you shouldn't forget that (3) the hotel provider is acting fully within their legal rights per T&C agreement you made with them. It would be great if the hotel allowed you to break the contract freely and cancel your reservation but they have done nothing wrong, unethical or illegal here at all. This is nothing like stealing whatsoever."
"Arkady, you also have to realise it is not possible some hotels to fill a room at three days notice if you cancel so even if you move your booking to a future date, they may still lose out the money from the original three nights you booked. You can't expect a hotel to lose money over something that is your problem. There is no reason to force hotels to accept a standard cancellation policy, if you don't like the risks involved, if a 100% cancellation policy is too high for you, book a different hotel or different rate which may give you a more flexible cancellation policy.Edited: 3 years ago "
"The other replies are correct. You have no issue with Booking.com, your issue is actually with the hotel for enforcing the exact conditions that you agreed to when you made the booking. I think that this is entirely reasonable, sorry. It's not the hotel's fault that you have visa issues which mean you can't travel on the dates you booked. I don't think it's fair to expect the hotel to suffer financially, as they may well do.It certainly isn't stealing, legally or otherwise, as you willingly entered into a contract under which you have certain rights but also certain responsibilities."
I am in Hua Him &. Have been to see Chom View Hotel. It's not a place I want to stay but the hotel says it cannot do a cancellation. I have tried through Booking. Com but cannot access a cancellation. Site. The booking is for tomorrow night- Friday. Please help. Thank you

I called Booking.com with the same issue. They could not have been more helpful! Took a while to get through. gentleman was exceedingly understanding. even got a senior colleague to verify his position. Requested an email to same effect.
"My experiences with Booking.com is that they have been very helpful when I've had to contact them., Although I admit that hasn't been very often."
"I also made a booking for the wrong hotel!!! And I was so upset, and called hotels.com through which I had booked. They were so helpful! The hotel I actually wanted wasn't available anymore through hotels.com and still the guy at customer service tried and spoke to the hotel and thank goodness we git our money back despite it bein non refundable. I was really happy and impressed by hotels.com"

"I'm very glad to hear of that outcome.In such scenarios, my personal mantra is about credit where credit is due, and in this instance, the credit goes to the hotel, not Booking.com.Yes, they played their part, but the hotel is the one who waivered the penalty.Edited: 3 years ago "
"It is/was the hotel's decision, not Booking.com's, but at least the latter ar eprepared to try and assist by contacting the hotel. Fair enough, though. As we wouldn't bl;ame Booking.com if the hotel had said 'no'. nor should they get credit when the hotel says 'yes'."
Just experienced the same. Booking.com was quite helpful and simultaneously I called Amara Santuary Singapore also to negotiate directly which helped me arrange a cancellation mail for booking.com quickly.And boom my cancellation was free.
I have a similar question I'm 19 and book a hotel reservation today and didn't read the important requiments. It says guest must be 21 yts or older do you think I'll be fine ? Or am I completely screwed and can't get my money back
"Are u being accompanied by 21 yr+?? If yes, then shouldn't be a problem at the time of checkin or else it's a chance u are taking. So decide basis the risk u can take"
"tysauls98, You should contact booking.com and ask how your situation should be treated. Given that you were under age at the tim of booking, you technical failed to meet the (age) condition for making this reservation. As such, it may be treated as null and void and simply cancelled. Just give them a call and explain what happened!"

"jillkelly44,This is a public open forum on TripAdvisor. This is not booking.com Customer Service. We are just travellers and TripAdvisor members like you. So we can't cancel bookings you made on that website.It's not wise to type your booking number and booking.com PIN number on a public forum in the internet. Please remove your posting immediately to protect yourself and your booking.com account. If you are on the full TripAdvisor website, not the APP you should see a blue 'Report Inappropriate Content' link under your typing. Scroll through its options and click on Remove my Post. When the page is refreshed it will be gone.You need to contact www.booking.com directly."
The difficulty I have is that it is often impossible to find the cancellation deadlines. I looked for a long time on a few different pages and found nothing. I now understand that it is under some small blue question mark at the bottom of a text-filled page. Hardly encouraging to the consumer.
"When I go to the Booking.om website, joh, I see the the cancellation deadlines clearly under My Bookings. Perhaps the UK Booking.com site is different?"
"My father has run into a similar problem and I am trying to help him get a refund, but cannot find a phone number to call anywhere. Any guidance would be extremely helpful. Thank you so much!"
All my reservations made on booking.com have contact details and phone numbers on the emails they send confirming my booking. You can also go into a section of the website to Manage the Booking.
Access through the Your (my) bookings section and you can manage a cancellation from there.
"Yes, I've cancelled a few bookings and it's been very easy. That's why I was wondering if the UK site that I use is different in some way."
"I had to cancel a reservation earlier this week and change to a new hotel for a summer holiday we are taking. The cancellation timeline image and details shown within the 'view booking' page was very clear, evident and easy to understand. I use the USA version of the booking.com website."
"That sounds pretty similar, if not identical, to what I see, Bradjill."
"Hi there,I had a similar problem and rang booking.com on Saturday evening having reserved a hotel which then told me it was non-refundable however there had been no notice of this until after I had made the reservation. The person I spoke to in customer care for booking.com tried to contact the hotel but there was night manager on the floor and so he made a note for it to be dealt with on Sunday. I received an email within a day telling me that my reservation was cancelled with no charge on my card. I gather this was mix of trying to contact them as soon as I'd seen the error and also the hotel being gracious enough to comply. The customer service from booking.com was great though. I use booking.com a lot and have always recommended it to friends and will continue to do so."
"Good to hear of your outcomeThe praise for Booking.com is well deserved, but credit where credit is due, and in this instance, the praise should also be going to the Night Manager and the hotel for following through with their promise.Always reassuring when those in the industry act and perform with integrityEdited: 3 years ago "
"I have always found Booking.com's service to be very good on the very few occasions I've needed it. As KVE has said, the decision is down to the hotel, so they also deserve a lot of praise for both dealing with the situation in a timely manner and for exercising their right not to enforce the T&C's to the letter."
"Interesting thread. It does however reveal that there is a lack luster approach to adhering to the terms and conditions that are agreed upon, when checking the ""I accept box"".As a hotellier, it's amazing the creativity shown and excuses made, when clients want to cancel a non refundable or non amendable reservation.Many seem to believe that - it's just a hotel - and they can afford to sustain a loss. Listen folks, many hotels are small business's, and are capital intensive business - think staff bills, cleaning costs, mortgages, interest on bank loans, water bills, electricity, VAT, commission to Booking.com, etc etc - as part of the costs.So when you break your contract (reservation) with us, you are leaving us out of pocket regarding a sale which we relied on. Now if every one could freely cancel - at no cost - how in the name of god would we be able to calculate and forecast our occupancy, revenues, costs.When we beak our contract with a client (not honour a reservation) - overbooked or do not provide the service booked - we end up with negative social media posts and subsequent losses.Terms and conditions are there for a reason - ensure that you read them. If you disagree with them, don't proceed. In the event that an unforeseen incident should occur - ensure that you have insurance to deal with it.I have a standard reply ready - what part of the terms and conditions to which you agreed did you not understand..... all to often, the reply is... I did not read them.Who is at fault ?"
"Ther eis no doubt in my mind that peopel should read the T&C's when they book or buy anything. I have little sympathy for those who don't and then expect to cancel non refundable rooms at the last minute.I have more sympathy for thoise who make a mistake and seek to rectify it in the first day or two after making a bookin, especially for a stay that is going to be months in the future. I think it is good when hotels are inclined to waive their conditions and allow a free cancellation, but I also think it is entirely fair if they choose not to."
"Some fair points but it's a double edged sword>>>As a hotellier, it's amazing the creativity shown and excuses made, when clients want to cancel a non refundable or non amendable reservation<<<As a hotelier, it's amazing the lack of integrity (and lack of imagination) shown by some hotel staff and the out and out lies they tell guests when they themselves have deliberately overbooked, made errors, and then make up ridiculous excuses that don't add up. It makes the industry look stupid.You speak of losses, and I absolutely understand. But when hotels destroy once in a lifetime or the last bucket trip of someone's life, they too need to be accountable.So who is at fault? Not reading T&C's is the guests fault. This however doesn't always means it's the guests fault. I've seen enough to suggest the hotel are as equally bad at keeping to their own terms. Guests should also be better educated in their legal rights, so that they can exercise every option they're entitled to.Edited: 3 years ago "
"KVE - I had an inclination that you would choose to comment.The issue being discussed is however - How to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.com.As long as the terms are clearly described by the property on the site in question - there is no discussion.Your comment regarding the lack of integrity by some of my industry colleagues, should as I pointed out lead to negative social media comments, a tarred reputation and deserved potential losses. My industry colleagues should properly train staff in dealing with these issues in order to protect their business's reputation.Edited: 3 years ago "
"As a hotelier, agree with much of what you say, but it isn't that clear cut.>>>The issue being discussed is however - How to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.com<<<I don't believe that is the issue being discussed at all. If it's a verbatim question of *How to cancel a non refundable reservation* - then the simple answer is you go into your booking and you cancel. There is nothing preventing them from cancelling.The actual question people are really asking is how do they get a *refund* on a non refundable reservation. More on this below.>>>As long as the terms are clearly described by the property on the site in question - there is no discussion<<<Do we believe that terms are clearly stated in every hotel listing? Globally, I don't believe there is consistency across the board. As for 'no discussion', that unwillingness (in some, not all cases) in itself serves to add to the 'closed' nature impression of the industry - for which the industry as a whole is now wearing the brunt of outpouring on social media - whether it's true or fabricated.Yes, it's a difficult situation for it sides, but I don't believe for one minute that each and every attempt made to ask the hotel to reconsider, is a deliberate attempt at trying get around the terms and conditions. We deal in hospitality with humans - and one flaw with humans is that occasionally, genuine mistakes are made. Even if terms are being reinforced, the scope of options being available to guests, whether be it discretion, option to amend, transfer, modify, or any number of options is rarely stated - let alone clearly. So what I'm saying is that a good hotelier should try and avoid a 'Who's fault is it' type scenario, and make every attempt at creating a 'What can be done to resolve this mutually' scenario.This isn't to say the hotel should cut losses and refund everything, what I'm saying is that it's far from a no discussion situation, in fact the more discussion, the better educated the general public will be. This will help minimise grief to hoteliers long term alsoEdited: 3 years ago "
"KVE - The heading in the thread is ""How to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.com"".... I am fully aware that the point is more on how to get your deposit refunded. I agree on many of your points. A property wishing to create flexibility will also create rates which reflect this in their terms. A property choosing to be restrictive, will have restrictive terms - and this is up to the individual property to choose how it wishes to sell it's products.In the same manner, a client wishing a greater level of flexibility should be aware of the limitations associated with a product they are going to purchase / book. It's up to the client to choose the product that best suites their needs - and there are allot to choose from.Hospitality is about being hospitable - and I preach this all the time to my staff, and it is reflect in how we run our business. That said, hospitality is being more and more abused by clients, many of whom utilise this particular media to display their disgruntlement often unwarranted or based on the fact that they did not get their way.Let us however maintain focus on this thread - How to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.com. Having read all posts - I do agree that the thread should have been titled otherwise, as the site in question does allow cancellation, and the crux of the matter is that clients all to often want all the advantages, and cry wolf when the tables turn against them, and they end out of pocket.I have personally stood in this situation, and despite using all my ""industry knowledge"" had to accept that I was at fault - an expensive lesson, which has subsequently entailed that I ALWAYS familiarise myself with the terms that I accept - from Apple updates, to concert tickets, to hotel reservations.Have a great weekend."
"I just tried to place a reservation on booking.com. †he website is intentially misleading, saying they will not charge your credit card until you arrive at the hotel, which was a blatant lie as the hotel charged me the full amount immediately. Also, there was no box or anything else to click that stated it was nonrefundable, and I clicked on all boxes to read ALL fine print. The resulting email was the first time it told me it was non refundable.BEWARE. The customer service rep was rude and laughed at me when I relayed the above info- I even stated I could send picture of each screen as I went through them to make the reservation, and he laughed again and hung up on me.Worst site ever, avoid at all costs!!!"
"As I mentioned on your other topic about this, maybe it's just a temporary pre-authorisation. Also, the words non-refundable are usually clearly stated on the Booking pages you book. Which hotel is this?I don't use booking.com a lot, but all the details are usually on the page."
How to cancel a reservation on Booking.com I still didn't pay for nothing only pressed reserve room but everytime I enter site it shows finish booking
"jessiesgrrl (post 101)Sadly, both of your issues are user mistakes!<<< they will not charge your credit card until you arrive at the hotel, which was a blatant lie as the hotel charged me the full amount immediately. >>>It appears that you misunderstand how booking.com operates. They didn't charge you for your reservation. The hotel charged you. Please read the actual terms & conditions of the website homepage so you can understand how the business operates. Essentially it is a web platform - that is pretty much it, they simply transfer your reservation and cc: details t the hotel who then charges you directly. <<<Also, there was no box or anything else to click that stated it was nonrefundable>>>Actually, it is very clear if the rooms that the hotels are offering are non-refundable or not. You simply have to look in the 4th column (Options) which are provided with every room type for every hotel which offers rooms on the booking.com. You will read Free Cancelation or Non-Refundable rate. You just need to read the pages more completely next time to understand if the room type/rate is refundable or not. <<<The customer service rep was rude and laughed at me when I relayed the above info....and he laughed again and hung up on me.->>>Not consistent at all with my experiences dealing with booking.com customer service reps in the past and frankly sounds a bit over the top if I'm to be honest."
"nadiatabone2 (post 103) Cancelling a reservation is very easy. Just enter your 'my bookings' page. View your booking and click the cancellation button. That is it, simple and easy!"
"BradJill, I very occasionally use the booking.com APP on my IPad and Non-Refundable or Free Cancellation are also clearly stated next to the room type, eg. Deluxe Room - Non-Refundable. Often I also see the wording further down about ""the hotel reserves the right to pre-authorise credit cards"". I like the APP better then the website. Everything seems quite clear. Also, usually the non-refundable rates are cheaper than ones offering Free Cancellation so it's also easy to spot the difference. Then you can make a choice."
"<<<Also, usually the non-refundable rates are cheaper than ones offering Free Cancellation so it's also easy to spot the difference. Then you can make a choice.>>>Exactly, Avanti_SG. Same room type, two different types... you simply look at the 'Options' column which is more or less the 'refundable' condition' It is very easy to spot when scoping out rooms."
Don't start betting on the non refundable being cheaper. I've at times seen the opposite. I actually remember one hotel that refundable with breakfast was less then non refundable without breakfast. I came within a breath of accidentally booking the wrong one.It makes very little sense I know. So read everything and assume nothing.
never seen that. Will pay extra close attention from now on as I don't want to 'Click and Book' then realise I have been careless. I agree with you about the need to read everything.
"Yes happened to me too and booking.com were able to cancel it for me and get a refund, especially if its within a day or so."
"I have a delicate problem . I ordered a hotel in Spain one night in May . It was a non-refundable room . It was cheap ; only 36 EURO.But the matter the fact was that my credit card didn't work. This is the first time happened to me even I have booked many rooms before with the same credit card.I had a mail from booking.com that I had to talk to my bank. I did and they said that the site was not secure and that they refused to transfer the money !!Due to the policy that they needed the three secure number on the back side of my visa card , which booking.com didn't asked for.This happened two times that I tried to pay with my card , and the bank still refused.Then I cancelled my booking , and received a mail from booking that I have to pay , even my cancelling was 6 weeks before my stay !!I have sent a complain to booking , and have no answer not from booking not from the hotel.My question is from a justice point . When I didn't pay for the non-refundable booking , in reality I didn't book because the term was that I had to pay. So they cannot claim me for anything when their paying system don't work and they have not given me an alternative ?"
I agree that you didn't complete the booking . The failure to provide a working CC meant the booking wasn't valid.OTOH was it your bank requiring the CVV number on the back of the card? Or theirs? Most of the online orders I place nobody asks for the number.
"As a B&B often they don't even call me - simply have a 4 button email where I pick (free cancellation, charge, partial charge or date change) I am sorry but don't allow date change without speaking to the customer because to often they move it outside my cancellation policy and then 5 minutes later a cancellation comes through. We are a small business so can't afford to have empty rooms. You might as well ring the hotel direct we allow partial charges, moves of dates, or gift vouchers - but generally you are better booking with the property directly as then we have more discretion on how we handle it. I would point out that non refundable rates are cheaper for a reason that is why they are non refundable so if you are booking one check and recheck your dates - we often get people book for the wrong date, month or year."
I agree with you. I prefer booking directly with the property when I can.
"Yes , I think it's better to book directly with the property.This huge booking industry is taking to much space .I hope one day we can find another system that is closer to the costumer .You feel in a way lost in the system and it is scary."
"As a B&B owner you get to deal with me directly - ie the buck stops here - any refund decision is mine, any problem with the booking is my direct responsibility and I can also make sure if you have any special requirements ie diet, stairs, parking or any other questions I can help you (we live here) and if my property isn't suitable for you then you will know straight away. For example I live in a victorian town house and our only single room is on the top floor (3 flights) and we are always getting requests for ground floor single - we can't do this - we have 2 ground floor double rooms and can do double for single occupancy but this is more expensive. Booking.com won't let me add this to my description as its too difficult to translate."
Just keep in mind too that my understanding is that legally a contract has not been entered into until money changes hands so if this has not yet occurred then you should not be liable to pay any monies.Also as with many businesses hopefully all accommodation places have a 24 hour grace period to allow for booking mistakes - just good customer service.
"@Fairy58<<<legally a contract has not been entered into until money changes hands >>>Unfortunately, this is not how contractual law works. Payment is just one of the various terms of a contract. They need to occur at the agreed time, which can be at the point the contract is entered or at any time in the future - as should be specified in the terms & conditions of the contract. In fact, a great many types of contracts have payments that occur in the future, including booking.com when you agree a reservation where by you pay when you arrive at a hotel, not at the time in which you made the reservation and entered a contract with the hotel."
"I made a non-refund booking and when the funding didn't take place, I didn't book !!The agreement was that I had to pay to fulfill the booking !!"
"Hey guys i was hoping if someone could help me. I booked a hotel in el nido for 1300 which is for the end of April. However the next day I found out my grandma from overseas is really sick and I will go see her with my partner and family instead of this trip to el nido. When I book the hotel I entered my cc details, but they have not charged me yet. It was a reserve now pay later. I email booking.com explained my situation and they said they can not cancel. Keeping in mind that I cancel within 24 hours and they haven't took any money out yet. I just cancel my card. They wanted to charge me the full amount of 1300 to cancel which I think is a joke. Is there anything booking.com can do example. Send debt agency after me ??Edited: 3 years ago "
"jamessun5492Log into booking.com. Go to ""View all bookings"" find the booking you wish to cancel. Then just cancel it.If there is going to be a penalty for cancelling then you will need to contact your travel insurers to see if your situation is coveredEdited: 3 years ago "
I wonder too what they can do if they decide you have to pay.When living in another country can they send debt agency after you ? :-)Edited: 3 years ago 
I book two days ago cancel yesterday. And they replied today I have to pay the full amount to cancel. I'm from Australia I book through a booking agency booking.com. And I got no travel insurance haven't even book flights yet.
"""When I book the hotel I entered my cc details, but they have not charged me yet. It was a reserve now pay later"".You said ""It was a reserve now pay later"". So is there a non refundable deposit ? If you give a link to the booking site, we may be able to offer more advice"
"In my case I wanted to book in booking.com , but my bank refused to transfer the money because they said the site wasn't secure. I tried two times , but still the bank refused . I communicated with my bank through my netbank , so I have the proof that it was'nt me that stopped the transfer , but the bank.It is nothing wrong with my card. I have booked many times , and after I cancelled I booked a new hotel in Malaga through Hotels.com.Let them come with their claim !! I won't pay !!If they can not provide me with a secure way to pay , I have not ordered anything from them !!"

"I have booked in advance for a Hotel in Manchester England we cannot go on holiday at all due to friend travelling with daughter baby life in jeapardy.This did not matter to the Hotel they already have charged my credit card in advance long before I travelledthey wsillnot refund or even take a charge for administration I offered, booking .com tried to help but hotel not budging I will keep seeking advice."
"134. I'm afraid you agreed to the terms and conditions when you hit the ""book now"" button. I assume it is a non refundable reservation. You will need to claim from your travel insurers."
I just did that and rang them and they were really nice!
Rang who? Your insurers? Can you claim?
>>>This did not matter to the Hotel they already have charged my credit card in advance long before I travelled<<<This says it all. Terrible circumstances but it has nothing to do with Booking.com. It is only the hotel who has the discretionary powers to make the decisions
If you book a non refundable it is exactly what it means. Bottom Line
Dose anyone know that if you could still amending the dates with Non-refundable bookings? Thank you.
You would need to contact booking.com to see if it's possible and if there is a fee you would need to pay to make that change.
"I would like to make a non-refundable reservation on booking.com. My question is, does the hotel deduct the amount for the room before my stay or it is deducted when I get there."
"#142. It will be clearly stated on the booking page.In my experience you should expect the payment to be taken immediately, otherwise why would the hotel make the offer?"
"One of the problems is third party booking sites. You think you are booking directly with the hotel and find out that when confirmation comes through it is via one of the .com booking sites. This has got to be deceptive and misleading. The problem then arises that if there are any issues, the booking site tries to wash their hands of it (although I do acknowledge that some of the previous posts are very positive about certain sites) and the hotel uses their non-refundable policy to avoid refunds. How a 'policy' can over rule consumer law is beyond me.Edited: 3 years ago "
"I use the APPS of hotel booking sites like booking.com or Expedia or Agoda or Hotels.com. I click on their APP icon on my ipad main screen so know where I am. Or I have them Bookmarked on my Laptop so I can go to any of their websites. I never think they are any hotels official website.Do you mean that you Google a hotels name and click on one of the search results and think you are on the hotels own official page, make a booking and only realise it's a third-party site once the emailed confirmation comes through?Edited: 3 years ago "
"Hi there, I was looking at the cost of hotels for a possible trip to USA in December as apparently there are fees added for various services that don't show on the actual hotel price. I made a reservation and going through the process it asked for my credit card details, this is where i stopped and wondered this is only an enquiry and not a booking, i the saw below the credit card details it said that you do not need to enter your ccv number as the card number is only for verification and no monies will be debited. However i then received an email to confirm my booking and that the booking is not refundable and the next day the full amount was debited to my credit card, unfortunately or fortunately there was not sufficient money in the account. I contacted booking.com and the hotel, but they refuse to cancel the booking and I am liable for the FULL amount. SURELY this is illegal if they have taken the money even though they said that they will not as my ccv number was not entered, and my enquiry was for DECEMBER 8 months away? i made the same enquiry dates etc. with another hotel and the same happened however they (PARAMOUNT) were kind enough to cancel the booking without costs THANKYOU. Perhaps booking.com should install a flag on their system showing that when booking dates that co-inside and where hotels and non-refundable it will pop up, as I am sure many people make enquiries and this happens.Any advise how to solve this matter."
"It comes down to noticing details on their hotel listing - often under 'Important Hotel Information' at the very bottom.

"I made a mistake and booked the wrong date for our 1 night stay through Booking.Com. I called the hotel and they said to work with Booking.Com to make the change. It's 2 months away. I called Booking.com and they are contacting the hotel manager to get approval for the date change (1 week apart.) Neither dates are holidays or big events so I am hoping to get my non-refundable reservation changed. I would recommend booking directly through the hotel from now on. After booking this via a 3rd party, I looked on the hotel website and the room is the same price directly through them and they only hold the reservation, instead of charging your card right away and saying non-refundable/non-changeable. I wish I would have checked this first!"

What I was inadvertently doing was booking a second room, so when the reservation was confirmed I had booked 2 rooms instead of one. I immediately cancelled the second room but of course it was the non refundable option. Booking.com advised me to contact the hotel which I did but they have not replied so at the moment I am stuck with paying for 2 rooms. I am still hoping that the hotel willc ome back to me."
"The hotel may take pity on you and allow you to cancel without penalty, but at the end of the day some of the mistakes we make do cost us. I know that only too well from my own experiences!"
">>>What I was inadvertently doing was booking a second room, so when the reservation was confirmed I had booked 2 rooms instead of one<<<Common enough mistake and so hopefully the hotel will use their discretionary powers to cancelFor future reference, if wanting to add a name of a second guest onto a single reservation, always request it directly with the hotel, to add a 'sharer' onto the reservation. Sharer is the technical term for a second profile on one reservation."
@155Leave the second room. Get yourself a nice sleep. :)
Post 155 is an unfortunate user-error. Hopefully the hotel acts responsibly and allows cancellation of the unintended 2nd room booking. Do return and inform of the outcome of your communication and cancelation request with the hotel.
"The exact same thing happened to me. Almost word for word. The hotel blamed it on booking,com and booking.com blamed it on the hotel. I will never use booking.com again. The advertising is a lie. I will also never stay at a Best Western as the GM of the hotel was a mean uncaring man who was only interested in the almighty dollar and had no interest in the fact that my daughter had a medical emergency and was unable to travel."
"<< I will never use booking.com again. The advertising is a lie. >>Booking.com don't put the information on their site. It is uploaded by the hotel. If the information is incorrect then blame the hotel, not booking.com."
I made a terrible mistake I wanted to surprise my wife on her birthday and to book her a week in London UK in a hotel of my choice. I choose a sub standard 2 star hotel dirty bathroom and a really bad joint. Instead of great surprise it turned out to be a night mare . It was a non refundable booking. I called booking 3 times and in the 3 times the guys were cooperating but the hotel turned us down. I called the hotel directly and the person In charge reverted that he cannot refund and that the owner will not refund. I wrote to booking customer serviced 3 emails and heave not heard from them . I checked with the bank and the hotel withdrew the amount and I am rally pissed and angry.What to do next ?Can someone advise as I am hyper ventilating and suffering high blood pressure in addition to a divorce case in boiling.Thanks
"@162Looks like you have exhausted all avenues. If the hotel has been contacted and they will not agree to you cancelling your non-refundable room then that's it.Booking.com won't be able to help further. Best to check hotel reviews in advance of booking. Also, if you think your plans might change then don't book a non-refundable, non-changeable room rate.Looks like you will have to chalk this one up to experience and book another hotel instead to save an ear bashing from Mrs.Ahmed A."
#160You can claim from your travel insurers.
"Ahmed, the on ly person you should be angry wiht is yourself, for booking a room at a non refundable rate without doing enough research first.The hotel is entitled to enforce the terms that you agreed to, and Booking.com can't override them, so you have no cause to be angry with either of them."
You are absolutely right I have to chew on it and be careful next time once bitten twice shy
"Yes, you can take a positive from this by treating it as a learning experience."
"burgeoningrose (post 160) <<< The hotel blamed it on booking,com and booking.com blamed it on the hotel. I will never use booking.com again. The advertising is a lie. >>>Blamed what? What was advertised that wasn't true?"
I'm pleased to report that the hotel - the Mina-A-Salam have agreed to cancel the second room without charge.
That's good Paul. Some hotels can be understanding and willing to do that.
"A good result, and well done to the hotel for showing some discretion."
"I have just experienced a perfect service from booking.com customer service in Czech Rebublic. I needed to cancel a booking that would otherwise result in 125 EUR cancellation fee so I chanced it and called them if anything can be done about this. The lady on the customer service line was very helpful and nice, contacted the property and they agreed to cancel the reservation for free. It made my day. I understand that this may not be a standard outcome and to achieve this you will need an understanding property owner as well as a willing customer service worker. One way or another, it is worthy to try and contact the booking.com if they can help and resolve the situation."
"I have always found Booking,com staff responsive and helpful. But just as they should not be blamed when the hotel will not show any discretion, neither shoudl they be praised when a hotel does."
What did you say was the reason for your cancellation? I have made a reservation in Orlando and they are requesting the total now but I dont have the funds as it is in excess of $1600 (£1250 ish). i thought I could pay on arrival but misunderstood and made the reservation by mistake.I want to cancel it and make the booking as a whole with Thomas Cook and pay over the year??
made two booking but I only need one as they are both for the same date .western hotel co mayo
"Contact your respective hotels and see what they say, you have more chance of a favourable outcome if you deal with the problem as soon as you can"
"donnademistralOne option would be to contact the hotel and explain the situation. To get contact details: from the main page on booking.com select view all bookings, then view the specific booking(s) you have made for that hotel. On the view booking page there are usually options such as email the property or message the property and there is usually a contact tel number for the hotel. Telephoning the hotel directly might be the quickest option."
i booked a non refundable hotel room with Travelodge in Birmingham for December this year but am unable to take this up as I am going into hospital for replacement knee surgery is there any advice on how to get my money back please
178. Claim on your travel insurance
"I can't think of any other way to get your money back. Travel insurance is going to be your only option. If you don't have it, you will lose the money you paid, sorry."
I had same problem but I wanted to change date as I had booked the week before using the calender icon(finger slipped and it was late at night when I made the booking!) I tried contacting hotel direct(this might work with smaller hotels) with noot much luck. They kept going through central reservations and refering me to booking.com. I then contacted booking.com customer services who were very helpful and understanding after I owned up to being stupid and incompetent plus being aware of t & c s. All was sorted and at a cheaper price although I do not travel to the hotel for another three weeks so hopefully all will be OK when reaching hotel. I do have all the neccessary documentation from booking.com in hard copy
Lucky You!! I made a non refundable reservation through Booking.com. This was full payment 5 months in advance!! Then found that the hotel's own website was considerably cheaper! Under the Booking.com Best Price Guarantee the difference is supposed to be credited. I contacted Booking.com.......after a week they responded by telephone advising me that my 'claim met their criteria' and I was due a refund... however because the refund was over a certain amount it would have to be referred to Management.....needless to say the goalposts were moved and Management then rejected my claim. Booking.com are absolute sharks. My case is with Trading Standards. DO NOT USE!!
Why on earth didn't you look at the hotels website first and why bother looking at it immediately after you've already booked a non refundable room elsewhere? As there's only one side of the argument here I wouldn't avoid booking.com based on what you've said.
"Booking.com has an awesome support service and if you need to cancel a non-refundable reservation just cancel and call the support. I had a similar problem, made a reservation but had to cancel it 1 day before the arrival due to personal problems (the reservation was also non-refundable). I called the support , they contacted the hotel and in 10 min i got a confirmation call that i don't need to pay the fee (which was 490.5 euro). They have a great service! Ofc keep in mind that the hotel makes the final decision regarding cancellation fee."
"robins, my experiences with Booking.com have been more like Kir's have been than yours. Maybe that's because I do my price comparisons first and take no notice of marketing gimmicks like best price guarantees."

"I need help. Our son booked a non-refundable 7 day trip to Jamaica for next Oct. He booked in April. As soon as he and his girlfriend realized it was non-refundable they panicked but called Booking.com right away (15 minutes later). The rep said it was out of their hands they would call the hotel in Jamaica who said show up or not you will be charged $1800 us. They have been agonizing over this. This booking was for 6 months away! The credit card on file is his girlfriend and 1800US is way over her limit. Any advice short of cancelling the credit card They are in Alberta Canada perhaps consumer protection says they have a few days grace to cancel? They did call booking.com right away. Please, anyone who can help please let us know."
"Adrianna, I'm not sure why they're in a panic. They should take out travel insurance then if they have to cancel later they should get most of the money back, assuming the reason is an insurable one eg illness, not just because they changed their minds. As to the limit on the card used for the booking surely that hasn't changed since the booking was made? Here, cancelling the card wouldn't work as a way of getting out of a debt/money owing."
"If the hotel says the non refundable room they booked is non refundable, then it is just that. It's up to the hotel if they want to deviate from their own policies, but it would appear this hotel won't or doesn't want to. It's their rules, it's their decision.They should have insurance as a matter of course but whether it would cover them for cancellation would depend on the reason they cancel for. It isn't a cheap fix alternative."
"Now I'm curious...... One books a room for a holiday, it probably involves booking flights to get there and back. They book the time off work for the said holiday. So everything is in place. They then ""discover"" they have booked a non refundable hotel room ( at a cheaper rate than a refundable/flexible rate). Then they panic? Why? If they when they booked they intended going on the holiday, why does it matter if the hotel is ""non-refundable""? It's no different to booking a non-refundable flight.I have a trip in November and a long haul next January set up like this. Everything is taken care of, it's all paid for. It's stress free. I have got travel Insurance should anything untoward happen in the meantime.If at the time of booking you fully intend staying at the hotel....I don't get it. Why the panic??"
"I;m a bit confused as to why the panic as well. Did they book the hotel without booking flights or time off work? Were they just in the intial stages of planning, but decided for some reason to book accommodation even if they weren't certain they were going? If so, did they make a mistake in booking a non refundable room?If it was a mistake, then it will turn out to be an expensive one. It looks as if the hotel will not be swayed and are intent on sticking to the terms and conditions. As is their right. Cancelling the card doesn't cancel the reservation, I'm afraid, nor the contract they they have entered into. The hotel could choose to come after them."
"Totally agree!!! The same thing just happened to me today and I am livid! Booking.com takes no responsibility just a lot of ""unfortunately"".. makes their jobs easy blaming it on the hotels.. and the hotels blaming it on the crappy third parties.."
"Booking,com isn't a crappy third party. It doesn't deal with bedbanks or other suppliers, it's simply a platform that allows guests and accommodation providers to come together. The simplicity is why I use it as the next best option to booking direct.I'm not totally clear what happened to you, Mel, but it sounds like you want to get out of a non refundable booking, and it's true that the hotel will always have the final say on that. Booking.com and it's staff have no way of overriding a hotel's decision, I'm afraid."
Yet another first post ranter who hasn't the slightest clue who they've actually booked with.
"What shouldni do??? The agent ""reserved "" a booking for me and its not in the right area or a nice hotel...and now she saying its non refundable??? Im so upset man!!!"
"Nabeela S, booking.com is a self use website platform. You don't need an agent to make reservations on your behalf on booking.com. Why didn't you just book the accommodation yourself?"
What agent are you referring to Nabeela? I've never dealt with any agent when using Booking.com. Are you in the correct thread?
I havnt paid for it yet nor have i given them my details
198.So what was post 195 referring to?
Probably wondering why the pizza hasn't arrivedEdited: 3 years ago 
"I'm more confused than ever now, Nabeela. Who was this agent? Who were they representing? What did they reserve for you? And why didn't they want your payment details?It all sounds most odd to me."

"#204 You have posted personal information to a public forum , you need to remove your post asap."
"My problem is that I think the booking.com site is presented a bit deceitfully. I thought I was getting a fully refundable offer. I saw in large green letters just below my booking that this was the case. But actually it was a different option. You have to reclick the deal you were offered to zero, move down to the next click box, and set this to the number you want. Then confirm. On a small screen, or if you are not concentrating, or are under stress, it is very easy to misunderstand. I think booking.com did it this way deliberately to suck people into a deal that was not what they they thought it was."
"I don't book anything on a small screen. Nor do I book anything when feeling stressed or tired. It's too easy to make a mistake when doing any of those things.So perhaps I'm not the best person to comment, but to me it always seems very clear what I'm going to book, and I've always found the process straightforward. That may not be the case if I tried booking on a phone in the middle of the night :-)Edited: 3 years ago "
"check out their page. Of course you argue that it is in the small print and you should have seen it. But the price info about the higher price option with free cancellation is is in brown letters to the left of the info about the free cancellation conditions which is in capitals, has check marks, is bright green, about 6 fonts bigger, and is immediately below the non-refundable deal information."
"I think a lot of posters on this thread, especially Roj is very familiar with booking.com because he uses it. Roj never has any problems finding the information that is in front of him, neither do the vast majority of other uses, including myself. I see quite clearly that some rooms say 'free cancellation before xxx no prepayment needed' and others say 'non refundable. Pay in advance'. There's also a question mark icon next to and if you hover over it it gives details. They're all right next to the drop down box where you select the number of rooms, so you'd have to being trying pretty hard to miss it if you don't see it. I really don't know how much clearer they can make it. Booking.com have nothing to gain by doing something deliberately ""to suck people into a deal that was not what they they thought it was"" especially given the deal is explained very clearly."
"Some people see all colours, some do not. Some people are partially blind and do not see small print. Some read left to right, some right to left, some down and up. Some are familiar with idea of hovering, some not, and some use a non hovering technology. Some understand a click box, but not all. Because one person, or even many,get it right does not mean that others will do. Booking.com should help people who made an honest mistake when there presentation, to be charitable, contains many ambiguities."
"One of my relatives is partially sighted. he has visual aids to help him, but he doesn't feel comfortable booking anything online without assistance in case he makes a mistake. I don't feel it's the responsibility of any retailer or booking site to take into account every possible vision, reading or comprehension problem that someone may have. I don't have fantastic sight myself, so I take extra care, get a second pair of eyes in to double check everything, and use the screen zoom a lot.They absolutely should follow best practice and, naturally, any applicable local legislatiion with regards to making the site accessible, but that's as far as it goes for me. If anyone feels that a problem they have had has been caused by something on the website, then they are at liberty to raise that with the company, but I think that personal responsibility has to come in at some point, whether that is not m,aking a booking when you are tired in my case, or getting someone to help you if you aren't sure of something."
"I suppose I fundamentally disagree. No site is perfect, but almost all could and should be improved. It is just as easy to have large letters as small. It is just as easy to separate and explain possible choices as not. What colours to use to create clarity is well documented. It is no problem to have 'are you sure' and 'are you really sure' options. It really is unfair to exclude people such as your relative from getting good deals when it is not necessary.Anyway, in my case, I contacted the hotel and they let the booking be cancelled. Which I appreciate."
"Fundamentally I actually agree with your thoughts. But the business reality is that they are all similar and they are similar for a reason - to cater to the mass majority. Their purpose isn't to cater to everyone, an OTA's purpose is to sell for the benefit of their most important clients - the suppliers.No matter how much scientific or anaecdotal evidence is provided about clarity, better visibility, and functionality, ultimately their primary purpose is to complete a sale. Not caution and potentially place doubts by 'over' emphasising policy.And all things being not-equal, Booking.com does it better than most. Otherwise stats would indicate a decline in turnover/volume/revenueEdited: 3 years ago "
"I think that it's unfair to single Booking.com out, so I'm happy to see you are saying that all sites could be improved. I think there's a lot of truth in that. I also agree with KVE that the reality of the world is different from what we might like it to be. There are lots of things I'd change if I could, but I still don't think it's realistic to expect any site to cater for absolutely everyone.Even though we might disagree on some things, I'm very pleased that the hotel has agreed to cancel your booking."
I cant get the right tome plz cancell the room
215. You need to contact the hotel

how u do it can u plz help me am in a same situation
Same situation as what? There are 217 posts before yours and no one has a clue which one you're referring to.
"how to cancell non refundable hotel , as i have not paid any amount for hotel as its pay at hotel. so if i cancell hotel then how they will charge me. they have taken my credit card payment option detailsEdited: 3 years ago "
"221. As they have your card details, they will charge that card."
"Can i get a refund for a flash flood warning? Does that fall under any refundable category, such as severe/extreme weather? The hotel owner can't accommodate us by moving our reservation because they are ""overbooked"" for the whole summer and won't offer refund without penalty - 80% of booking cost."
"Natural disasters, or floods may be covered under your Travel Insurance Policy. Did you organise your own Travel Insurance this trip?Booking,com and hotels don't usually refund you if you chose a deal which was non-refundable. It is a travellers responsibility to choose and get a suitable Travel Insurance Policy for trips they take if they are concerned about cancellations, delays, or natural weather events which could delay or force cancellation of your travel plans.Here is a topic with many pages of replies all about the importance of organising Travel Insurance -https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-…"
"Just to throw a similar question out there, I booked a rate which said no credit card needed to reserve and I was to pay the hotel on arrival.I booked and a day later I got an email via booking.com for payment from the hotel via a bank transfer. I wasn't expecting this as it clearly said pay on arrival. I wasn't happy about this so I cancelled the hotel. I then found out I was to be charged 70% cancellation fees. My question; if I didn't give them my credit card how can they force the charges on me? I'm an previous user of booking.com, if no credit card was needed can they use my card details from previous bookings to charge?"
Totally agree
226.With what?
But where are the phone numbers for Booking.com??? Not anywhere on their site. The hotel has no number either.
"rsn751From the homepage, near the bottom is a group of blue links including one called 'Customer Service Help'. Click it. Then, scan past the various help FAQ information until you find 'Still looking for an answer? Contact Customer Service directly:' Click there and choose 'other' from the drop down menu. More fields will open up allowing you to drop an electronic note to booking.com or call them. The local phone number from wherever you are accessing will be shown at that time as well. When I view it, it shows the Hong Kong flag next to the phone number. When I'm in the UK it shows the States, it shows the American flag. Hope this is helpful."
"Hmmm...Followed your directions, but I cannot see 'Still looking for an answer? Contact Customer Service directly:'"

"Hello,I have a similiar situation. I've booked a hotel and realised that this is non-refund reservation. Called the hotel but they didn't agree to cancel 100% fee.And here is my question - can I just cancel my debit card in the bank? They won't charge me if the card won't be working, right?"
Wrong. You entered into a legal contract and the hotel have a right to pursue you for the money you owe. Will they? No one can say. Some businesses sell their debts on to debt collectors who will most definitely want their money back!
">>>Some businesses sell their debts on to debt collectors who will most definitely want their money back!<<<Very prevalent/common in the US, and there are several debt collectors that deal exclusively in chasing up hotel debt.Edited: 3 years ago "
"PLEASE READ! YOU CAN CANCEL!Just got a non refundable hotel room which has been refunded to me! The steps are quite simple:I received my booking through booking.com; but this may still work for other websites. Make sure you CALL the booking website and speak to a customer service representative. It also helps to call the hotel before then and explain your situation- which of course, they will tell you to call the booking website. Then, the customer service rep will call the hotel, and ask them if it's okay. In my instance, the hotel gave the thumbs up and my money was refunded within minutes. Please try this method as it seemed to work very well!-Caleb"
"Yes, it depends on the specific hotel. Some will and some won't. Hotels set the Terms and Conditions and some stick to that non-refundable policy and that's why some people get upset and complain on these forums because the hotel won't change their policy and refund their non-refundable booking."
Indeed. I've had a non refundable room rate refiunded when I've contacted a hotel myself. Being polite and admitting making a mistake might have helped. But it's not an automatic right and I wouldn't have complained had my request been refused.Edited: 3 years ago 
"Booking.com in treating non-refundable reservations unethically. Each hotel has a non cancellation window typically 48 hr or 24 hours before arrival. This is clearly state in the detailed booking terms, but booking.com still offers you free cancellation booking options while you are already in the non cancellation period.It a highly misleading and unethical practice, so keep your eyes open and never believe the free cancellation clause unless you have checked the hotel policy in detail."
"If you booked through Booking.com, you need to cancel through Booking.com. It doesn't matter what the hotel's cancellation policy says. It's the one on Booking.com associated with your reservation that matters. Remember Booking.com can have its own arrangement with a property, giving the website a different set of cancellation policies. >>>Each hotel has a non cancellation window typically 48 hr or 24 hours before arrival. This is clearly state in the detailed booking terms, but booking.com still offers you free cancellation booking options while you are already in the non cancellation period."
"@Zoltan K (Post 238)<<<Booking.com in treating non-refundable reservations unethically. >>>Sorry pal! Way off the mark with this statement. Booking.com treats nonrefundable reservations exactly as they are - nothing more, less or different! If you book a nonrefundable room with a hotel on the booking.com website, and the hotel charges you prior to the dates/times stated per your reservation agreement, you should call booking.com directly to contest the hotels actions. Booking.com will assist from there. Nothing unethical at all going on here I'm afraid!"
Need to cancel a booking made for Sept 3rd 2017 with the spencer hotel dublin through booking .com unfortunately can't make it due to a hospital appointment hope it can be done
"Kathleen,This is a public travel forum on TripAdvisor not connected to booking.com in any way. We just chat about travel on here.You will need to get on the booking.com website and cancel on there. If you booked a deal with free cancellation you may get a refund but if your deal was non-refundable you probably wont. Read the T and C of your reservation."
"Sorry you can't make your trip, kathleen, but Avanti is right. And if you can't get your money back from the hotel on this reservation, maybe your travel insurance will cover you."
"Booking.com was wonderful, i forgot I made the reservation and cancelled last minute, they were able to call the hotel and get the fees waived. I will use them every time, the service is amazing, I was really freaking out about this, but they were soooo helpful and sooo understanding!!!!!!!! Thank u Anna, thank u Thank u!!!!"
"Given the amount of criticism, mostly unjustified, that Booking.com has received on the forums recently, it makes a change to be reading something so positive about them!"
"I had the same issue mainly due to the confusion caused by various banners on the website, I thought I was booking free cancellation option but I selected the first option. I and my wife booked two hotels separately for the holiday. Due to a personal issue we had to cancel the holiday and gave enough notice to booking.com who after speaking to the hotels refused to return the money as it was non-refundable. This was in the email small print which we both failed to notice, our mistake! I think it was a bit unfair as they must have easily rented the rooms at a higher rate due to the peak season. Later on I found out they use premium lines, this is not stated anywhere on the site so I received additional mobile bill of £24. All of this cannot be right. Highly disappointed with the service and website. I will stick to booking hotels via airline which keeps everything in one place and much more transparent. VS"
">>>I think it was a bit unfair as they must have easily rented the rooms at a higher rate due to the peak season<<<A common assumption amongst the general population who aren't intimately familiar with the industry.Peak season is no guarantee of a sellout - which is the very reason why they offer a slightly lower non refundable rate, to lock that occupancy in. Guaranteed revenue vs potential higher revenue that's not guaranteed? No brainer, experienced hoteliers will take the guaranteed revenue each and every time. So it's not unfair at all. It's business.As for the policy, it doesn't matter what Booking.com we're or we're not able to do, it's still the hotel who enforces the policy.Edited: 3 years ago "

Booking.com is one of the clearest, transparent sites around IMO.

"Vikas, you admitted your mistake intially, but you won't let things go. Now it's the premium rate phone numbers! I've always corresponded by email, which costs nothing.And no, I don't work for them either."
What will happen if you don't have money to your card?
"Mostafa M, You should contact your bank or credit card provider to ask that question."
"We booked an apartment in Fethiye which stated free cancellation, after booking it said non refundable. I know I should have looked at Trip Advisor before booking, but did so afterwards which is not like us at all, the reviews are horrendous, our main concern being burglaries whilst people asleep in their apartment. The other is the filthy apartments, bare electrical wires, filthy shower, damp, smelly rooms, dirty pool, wild chickens fouling all over the grounds, the list is endless. The good reviews are just below the booking page on Booking.com, however if you make an effort you can search their site and read the bad reviews too which again are horrendous. I contacted booking.com for help who said they would contact the apartment who refused point blank even though the booking is 10 months away so it's not like we're not giving them enough notice to 're-sell the room. I gave e-mailed booking.com to ask again for help due to the safety factor as we are a mature couple and want to feel safe but they are simply ignoring my messages. Feel sick to my stomach about it said all. We cannot afford to lose this money. We would stay with Booking.com and transfer to an alternative accommodation but it still makes no difference."
"Are you positive those apartments did offer free cancellation for the type of booking you made? If you provide the name, I'll take a look.Your booked apartment may be fine. I would assume the property has a good rating score, otherwise you wouldn't have booked them, would you?. What is it? Remember you can only leave a review on Booking.com after you have stayed. Whereas ""Anyone"" can submit reviews to tripadvisorEdited: 2 years ago "
"I booked it based on the good reviews under the booking page on Booking.com, it was only after reading trip advisor comments I delved further into the poor reviews on Booking.com. it has made me wonder how genuine the good reviews really are and now not sure I trust booking.com at all after reading so many bad things about them. The property is Villa Mare, Fethiye. It's got several other names too for some reason. The review that concerns us the most is the trip advisor Disgusting Hovel one and I realise people can use trip advisor as a sounding off medium after a bad holiday but there must be some truth in it surely. It's not just this comment but in particular the comment on Booking.com from Peter who had been going to Turkey for 28 years, very sad indeed."
"The property scores 7.9 ,with the majority of guests in the last 2 years scoring it 9 and above. It only takes 3 or 4 unfavourable reviews to drop a properties overall score down to below 8 ...Why wouldn't you trust the reviews that in the main are excellent?"
"I did a test enquiry, it states clearly on the booking page ""Low rate - no money back"" with further clarification if you hover on the question mark.If you go further by clicking on the ""reserve"" button. Then on the next page in ""Read me I'm important"" is the following.Policies of this villaChildren and extra bedsThere is no capacity for extra beds in the room.1 x ""Deluxe Two-Bedroom Villa""Cancellation: Please note, if cancelled, modified or in case of no-show, the total price of the reservation will be charged.Prepayment: You will be charged a prepayment of the total price at any time.Taxes and service charges: 8 % VAT is included. A City tax is not applicable A Property service charge is not applicable This is all visible before booking. So I'm afraid your booking will probably stand."
">>>it has made me wonder how genuine the good reviews really are and now not sure I trust booking.com at all after reading so many bad things about them<<<The exact same can be said of TA and the reviews found here. The difference being that on TA, you don't have to have stayed to write a review"
"I don't know why anyone would post such a detailed review on TA if they hadn't been, the difference is no one is trying to get money from you on TA."
"Some say that the reviews on Booking.com are more reliable since you have to have made a reservation and stayed in a place to writ one, which is not the case for TA.At the end of the day, we all need to read as many reviews from as many sources as we can so that we can build up a big picture. We all need to deciode for ourselves which ones we read are trustworthy and helpful."
Please confirm non refundable reservation can be adjusted in coming days
Any one please confirm non refundable reservation can be adjusted in coming days
"Mirza,This is Tripadvisor, not www.booking.com. Nobody here works for Booking.com. You will need to manage your booking on their website, or through a link in the emailed confirmation they sent you and see if you can cancel it. Non-refundable means that, so you can cancel but won't get any money back."
"How about this one. I used booking.com last month to reserve a hotel and all was good.A few days later I received a confirmation email from booking.com for 2 rooms under my name and someone else I don't know for a hotel I have never looked at.This was non-refundable. I immediately called booking.com (hung up after 20 mins), called the hotel in question who advised me to contact booking.com. Sent a few mails (from their site as there is no direct email address). Finally, today, they have said I must pay the cancellation fee as I selected this policy. I will not be paying this; either an admin error (a massive one) has occurred or their systems were compromised. Either way, they are not being very helpful"
270.Its very odd that you didn't get immediate confirmation by email.Would suggest you contact your credit card company re the the booking in a different name.
"I have just tried to cancel a booking via Booking.com and the company called the Cheshire Hotel in London, who refused. I will not be using either the Hotel or Booking.com again, especially as I had made a genuine mistake an tried to correct it within an hour of booking."
"The hotel refused. So why would you not use Booking.com again?If you saw an advertisement in a newspaper and you bought the product, but wanted to return it and the store refused - would you stop reading that newspaper?"

How to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.comif my son broke his leg and his in full cast plaster and can not travel
"Ask the hotel if they will cancel your reservation without penalty. Be very polite and don't hav ehigh expectations or get mad if they decline. If that happens, look at your travel insurance and see if you're covered."
"Hi. I realise that this post was from a while ago but just wanted to put up my current experience. My fiancee and I both booked a hotel for the same night in NYC to surprise each other for the last night of our honeymoon. We foolishly both booked non refundable and so had two hotels for one night. I called booking.com and spoke to an extremely helpful advisor called Ebony. She called one of the hotels straight away while I held the line. It is entirely down to the hotel whether they will cancel or not, booking.com were simply the middle man but they couldn't have been more understanding or helpful. Thankfully, the hotel in question were happy to cancel the booking free of charge and refunded the money already paid for the booking. If they hotel won't do it then I'm not sure that there's much booking.com can do but we were extremely lucky and it can be done."
278. Great to hear you had a good outcome
Need to cancel booking for 13 October to 16t October at The Rendezvous Hotel Skipton YorkshireUnable cancel in usual way or through hotel pl are advise
"Sophie,This isn’t booking.com so we can’t cancel a hotel for you. We are just travellers and Tripadvisor members like you on this public forum. Why can’t you cancel “cancel in usual way”. You would have internet access so access your emailed confirmation of the booking and there may be a link in there to you account, or go on the booking.com website and get into your account and manage your booking in there. If this was a booking allowing Free Cancellation up until a specific time and date before your arrival then you should get a refund. If it was a cheaper non-refundable deal then you probably won’t.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Sophie, what problems are you experiencing in cancelling? And what is it that's preventing you from contacting the hotel directly?I've cancelled quite a few refundable reservations on Booking.com. I can't recall ever trying to cancel a non refundable rate via Booking.com. On the few occasions I've needed to do that I've gone directly to the hotel. Sometimes I've been successful in cancelling without penalty, but once or twice I haven't."
"Hi, I the same thing happened to me, I am from New Zealand, but don't know the contact details for Booking.com in NZ. Can anyone help me."

"We are highlighting below our travel experience with booking.com and CASA HEINRICH Guest house in Zurich, SwitzerlandWe came across Casa Heinrich in booking.com when we were planning our trip to Europe in 2017. We made a booking for a Casa Heinrich suite on June 25, 2017. Casa Heinrich charged for the full cost of the booking to our citibank visa card. The cost of our booking was $372. Our booking was to stay in the hotel on August 13 on 2017. We subsequently made changes to our travel plans and dropped Zurich from our travel schedule. This occurred on July 9th. We immediately notified booking.com and Casa Heinrich of our change in plans and requested cancellation of our booking and full refund of our money.From July 9th onwards we have had a terrible time trying to convince Booking.com and Casa Heinrich to give us the refund. We cancelled this booking almost 45 days in advance and Casa Heinrich still refuses to give our refund. Casa Heinrich does not publish their contact info easily and they also don’t pick the phone. Had a difficult time even getting their emailWe filed the transaction under dispute with CITIBANK but just learnt that CITIBANK cannot help us since it’s the merchant's booking policy. We have lost $372 because we did not read the fine print before clicking the booking button. We consider this unfair consumer business practice on the part of booking.com and Casa HeinrichWe now plan to take the following actions1)I don’t think we will ever use booking.com on any more trips again since they are unwilling to remove merchants such as Casa Heinrich and inability of booking.com to help us. I hope someone can create a website where we can post merchants such as Casa Hienrich so that other don’t fall into the same situation2)We also will to post our experience on both these merchants on as many online travel forums as possible so that other travelers become aware of hotels such as Casa Heinrich with unfair booking practices3)We also plan to request other online travel agencies such as TRIPADVISOR, Kayak and other online hotel booking agents to display more prominent warnings to their customers for such non-refundable policies.Thanks"
"285. You didn't read the ""fine print"" and now you intend libelling the hotel...."
285. I've just checked on booking.com. It quite clearly States under every room. Non Refundable. Furthermore it is stated clearly on every page of the booking process.
">>>We have lost $372 because we did not read the fine print before clicking the booking button.<<< That's right. You failed to read and understand the terms of the booking you were making.>>>We consider this unfair consumer business practice on the part of booking.com and Casa Heinrich<<<Given you;ve just admitte dit was your own oversight, how on earth can you then say that it's unfair of the hotel or the booking agent? Assuming that it was clear on the site what the rules of th ebooking would be, it's not unfair at all, and I have no reason at all to doubt rawtalent when they say that it is clear.>>>We filed the transaction under dispute with CITIBANK but just learnt that CITIBANK cannot help us since it’s the merchant's booking policy.<<<This is further evidence, though it should not be needed, that neither the hotel nor Booking.com has done anything wrong.You are free to use whoever you want to use for booking accommodation, but to refuse to use Booking.com because you failed to read the T&C's seems ridiculous to me. If you do embark ona campaign of posting this wherever you can, I'm confident that you will get other responses in line with what you've had here, and you ill only contrive to make yourself look foolish.I'll say it again. It's not unfair at all to have non refundable rates and to enforce the T&C's that you said you agreed to without reading them. You need to take much greater care in the future, or you'll likely find yourself in exactly the same position again."
Can you just report your credit card stolen? Then they can't charge you. Dodgy but would it work? I hate these cancellation policies!
"It wouldn't matter if the credit card was lost, cancelled or stolen the debt remains that of the person who incurred it. dina1972's suggestion might lead to fraud charges. And you'd still owe the money."
"dina, I think that you have suggested is more than just dodgy, it's illegal. And as bcc says, it would have no effect on the debt at all."
"I had same problem with booking.com, I thought that I have choose the free cancellation booking, but unfortunately they charged me, I tried contacting million times with booking.com but they didn’t answer me, I also contact holiday inn express in Berlin, and they said by savage way that is your booking none refundable and we can’t refund your money. And even I can’t change the date. I am sorry for this bad hotel way.Also booking.com hide this terms and conditions in their website at a place people can’t find it.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I want go to see where they put this non refundable text at Booking.com website. It’s under button called cancellation policy and you have to click on it to read, they not put it front of you to read it without click on a button, it’s not usable way."
"292 & 293I've just checked the hotel on the booking.com website. As an example I asked for February 21st and was offered both refundable and non refundable rooms, obviously at different rates. If you input the same you will see how you made your mistake.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Booking.com don't hide anything. Cancellation policies are clear when you're booking. You don't have to click. As soon as you hover over the ""Cancellation conditions"" the cancellation policies are there. The same goes for the blue question mark. User error I'm afraid. You selected the wrong room rate."
"I am in the same situation and booking.com cannot help. The place has been booked again, so this means they received double payment for a single room - I cancelled immediately as I was under the impression that I won't be charged immediately - so in shock - I cancelled way in advance - since I saw money going out. Unfortunately I might not be getting my money back and Hotel Toko/West-inn - will be getting double payment for a room. This nonrefundable policy is just robbery to me -if the hotel get double payment for the room - I now can neither get a room at the hotel nor my money back as someone has booked??"
"Lucky escape I'd say. Looks horrendous https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g…Unfortunately, booking a non-refundable room means just that. If you change your mind, even if cancelling soon after booking, or giving the hotel notice, you are not entitled to a refund. If the hotel agrees to waiver that policy then it's a bonus, but certainly no right to receive money back.If they have now sold out then there is every possibility that they have benefits twice from a payment. Your original payment on the non-refundable room and that of the new booking."
"You r right my friend this is not fair from booking.com or hotels, I still don’t know if I cancel my booking and lose my money. Really unfair policy"
Booking.com have nothing to do with it.
"JImbo16i got similar problem with u. i book with out credit card details. is they still can trace our previous record. before this i use my friend's credit card maybe for 2times.and for the mistaken booking, i didnt put any card details.tq"

"I made a mistake and booked a non refundable room through booking.com and told them one day later and three weeks before the stay date.This hotel, which had a similar name as the hotel I intended to book, was not in the area of the place I need to be and I am in pain walking. I had no choice.Although booking.com tried to help, the hotel refused point blank to refund.The hotel staff were very rude to me and I believe that they were rip off merchants.Be very careful of pressing the wrong button when booking."
"I'm sorry that you've lost out, rose, but mistakes do hurt us financially sometimes, as I've learned to my cost down the years.I try to be as careful as I can when I;m looking to book anything, and I check everything using multiple resources, including the hotel's own website, and other sites like Google Maps and Google Streetview. That helps to minimise the chances of an error on my part, but I can still see that hotels with similar names can cause confusion.It is down to the hotel as ot whether they refund a non refundable booking or not. All Booking.com can do is ask them to do so on your behalf. They are entitled not to, though, and if they choose to refuse, that doesn't mean that they are scammers or rip off merchants, it just means that they have decided to enforce the terms of the contract that you entered into when you made the reservation.Thanks for sharing your experience, and for your reminder to be very careful."
"If thats non-refundable, the you can't do it. However if there is more than 15 days for your stay, you can try checking with their support team."
304.Support team??
Whose support team??Edited: 2 years ago 
I am having probelms with booking.com at the moment! I booked a holiday to Ireland a non refundable booking- after a few days of booking my uncle has passed away! I now need the money to cover funeral costs and solicitor costs. I have contacted Booking.com and they are only able to change the dates of the holiday. Now they have taken the money from my account - even though it was to pay when you arrive!! I am so upset with the way everything has gone and this is the last thing that i need right now! I need help!
307. Sorry for your loss. You will need to claim from your travel insurance.It would defeat the object of nonrefundable if you could pay on arrival.
"I'm sorry for the loss of your uncle, Steph. It's quite usual for non refundable rates to be payable immediately. It's up to the accommodation provider, not Booking,com as to whether they are willing to refund you or allow you to amend the date sof the reservation. Was it a hotel that you booked or some kind of rental? (they may work differently - I don't know as I've never booked one)."
"Non-refundable bookings are normally in consideration of a cheaper rate. If you wish to take advantage of that cheaper rate, then you should either insure against cancellation, or be prepared to take the hit. That said, as a small hotelier, I would always suggest that you contact the hotel direct. If the booking is a long way in the future they may offer you a credit note, or a refund if they are able to re-fill the room. Don't book on Booking.com with a dud or partially filled out card to try to ""get round"" a non-refundable rate , as this gives the hotel the opportunity to cancel your booking. We always cancel those bookings and we will not take another booking from that customer."
Solid advice there E&T
Cancelling the card wil make sure that the hotl cannot take the money from your account. Is this correct?
"No, that is not correct and is not a freedom pass to escape your obligations.The hotel can still chase you for payment."
You misunderstood my post Sir.Cancelling the card will make them unable to take the money from your account using the card details. Is this correct.
That may be the case Stu F but it sadly won't resolve the issue of owing money to the hotel. You entered into an agreement to make the payment.
"They cannot take the money off a card, but that does not cancel the debt. Maybe the hotel will not come after you for the money, but maybe they will. You have entered into a contract, and the hotel would be entitled to try and enforce it."

"317. You have posted on a public forum and included personal information, you really should remove your post"
I have been charged a non-refundable amount of on my booking. I have used booking.com many times and this has never happened before. This is very upsetting as the reason for using your site was that I could cancel before a certain date. Please let me know asap.
319.You need to check the terms and conditions of the accommodation you have booked.If you intend staying then it shouldn't really matter that you've already paid a deposit.
"parasail,This isn’t booking.com so none of us Tripadvisor members (ordinary travellers like you) can let you know as soon as possible about your booking with that company as we don’t work for them. I don’t use booking.com often as I prefer other sites, but Hotel deals on there can either be displayed as “Free Cancellation” or “non-refundable” and they have different prices next to them. Non-refundable deals tend to be displayed at the top of the list and are cheaper. If you chose a deal which was non-refundable then that’s been set by the hotel itself. Hotel pages on booking,com usually also have more information on exactly hat Terms and Conditions you are agreeing to on that page under “Important Information”. That’s further down the hotels page a little bit.Which hotel in which city did you book? Maybe we could take a look at it’s booking.com page and see if we can see the different booking types and see how you may have assumed everything would be Free Cancellation."
how do I do this?
"How do you do what? If you want to complain to www.booking.com then you can contact them on their website. Do you feel you were mislead by the information on the page you booked on? If you want us Tripadvisor members to take a look at that hotels page on booking.com just type it here on this forum (hotel name and city) and some of us can look at booking,com and see if we can find something you missed. Maybe there was something which said you would be charged immediately and you didn’t see that bit.Edited: 2 years ago "

329.This has nothing to do with B.com. You need to start a new thread.Edited: 2 years ago 
"I personally experienced this Today. I accidentally selected the wrong date for my booking and it was non-refundable. I called up the hotel in my home country and explained my situation but they said only Booking.com can help me. I contacted the local number of booking.com in Dubai and was answered by a very friendly and polite lady customer service. I told her that if possible, I need to cancel a wrong reservation that I accidentally made and that I already booked a new reservation with the correct dates. She passed my call to her colleague who also was very kind, polite and helpful. He said he will do his best to help me. He put me on hold whilst he contacted the hotel and confirmed with them that my reservation is cancelled. Gladly, the hotel agreed to waive the cancellation cost. When the customer service resumed our conversation, he said that he has already taken care of my cancellation request and that he has sent me a confirmation email that my reservation was cancelled free of charge. I was amazed by the customer service and professionalism of booking.com. I am beyond grateful for their help and assistance which has saved me a lot of money."
"In my case, I booked for the Friday night when I meant to book for the Saturday night. I realized my error a day later, contacted the hotel to change the date from the Friday to the Saturday (2 weeks in advance) and STILL had to pay the full room fee for the Friday night. Needless to say, I did not enjoy my stay and I felt that the hotel had been mean-spirited, to say the least."
"If you have a non refundable stay, a hotel is entitled to enforce the terms of that contract if they so wish. They don't have to, but many will do exactly that, as being able to re-sell the room again is all part of their business model and the way that they can offer cheaper non refundable rates in the first place."
"BOOKING.com and their non refundable policy. A person has booked a room with them, 6 months down the road charge your credit card for full amount as soon as you make the reservation. Things happen beyond your control ie. Vacation plans change and you try to cancel. Lots of luck. You pay say $400.00 for the room, plans change and booking.com keeps your $400.00 and turn around and the room is booked by someone else. BOOKING.com makes $800.Edited: 2 years ago "
"@mejay2015 (post 335) Probably best to read booking.com Terms & Conditions or even some of the previous hundreds of posts on this thread. If you had done either, you would quickly realise your failed understanding of how booking.com works. Sadly, the example you have provided is completely incorrect. You need to understand that booking.com is a hotel reservation platform only. They don't bill hotel guests ever. Only the hotels which sell their rooms on booking.com bill the hotel guests."
"@335 - there is normally an option to pay slightly more and have a reservation with the flexibility to cancel and obtain a refund, or to have actually not paid until your arrival day or shortly before."
"I just had the same issue. Two months before the check in date I had to cancel. The hotel wanted $900 as a cancellation fee for a$1000 reservation, outrageous. I called the hotel and they said they can't change 3rd party reservations, I called booking.com and after an hour on the line they informed me the hotel is unwilling to waive the fee.I would understand if it were a day or two in advance, but two months? This is an outrageous policy that really says a lot about how much they don't value their customers."
"Rami,It is the hotel which sets their cancellation policies and fees. Booking.com does not set those fees. So your upset is with the hotel. It sounded like the hotel decided to stick to their firm policies. If you booked a deal which had specific penalties and fees if you cancelled, then those would have been detailed on the booking page. Did you read that important information and policies before you booked?"
Sounds like the hotel are being generious. You selected and booked a non-refundable rate. You have cancelled and they are actually offering the refund $100.I don’t understand why people book non-refundable rooms then wonder why they are non-refundable when they cancel.
"I was not aware that the booking is non-refundable, it wasn't even cheap. I find that policy outrageous and completely not in line with what's the custom.But what I find the most annoying is that the hotel didn't even own up to their own policy. Even after calling them they threw the responsibility back to booking.com and informed me that they can't modify 3rd party reservations."
"341. You need to look at your confirmation email from Booking.com or Manage my Booking on their website.,and read the terms you agreed to. Can you claim on your travel insurance?"
">>>I find that policy outrageous and completely not in line with what's the custom<<<It’s entirely up to the hotel whether they enforce the policy or not. You mentioned it yourself the hotel is responsible for their own policy, nothing to do with the third partyEdited: 2 years ago "
"<<I was not aware that the booking is non-refundable,>>The cancellation policy applicable to the room you select is clearly shown several times while booking. If the hotel had uploaded incorrect information onto booking.com and said it was refundable and it wasn't then that is something you need to take further. It's more likely that you just didn't read the cancellation policy properly though."
"I'm afraid that Leyland is correct, Rami. I feel it's far more likely that you simply didn't notice that you were booking a non refundable rate. These are far more common now than they used to be, so you ned to check what you're booking quite carefully and not make any assumptions."
I made a hotel booking to travel to HK in February 2018; My sister got sick and I tried to move the dates to August 2018. I contacted booking.com and explained the problem but they wouldn't allow me to change dates. Lost a lot money but learnt a lesson. Select hotels that you can cancel or change. Be careful when dealing with booking.com. Ditto for my airline flights. I think the public is being screwed
"Comino,Your issue is with the hotel. They wouldn’t allow you to change the dates. Hotels set the policies not booking.com. Booking.com just acts as a platform to display the deals from hotels.If you booked a deal which was non-refundable then the hotel obviously stuck to their policies and terms and conditions and that doesn’t allow changing dates. Which hotel was this, as I’d like to know which specific hotel is “screwing the public” by not being flexible at all.Couldn’t you claim on your Travel Insurance if your trip had to be cancelled due to the health issue of an immediate family member?Same with your flights. Who did you book them through, as you can’t book flights on booking.com? Were they the cheaper airfares which dont allow free changes? Also, couldn’t you claim on Travel Insurance if your whole trip had to be changed or postponed or cancelled?Things happen when we travel, or sometimes before we depart. That’s why it’s important to take out Travel Insurance to cover those unexpected events. Yes, it also can be good to book a hotel deal which offers Free Cancellation up until a specific time and date before arrival. They are generally more expensive than the non-refundable ones, but you have more flexibility. Fully flexible airfare would be very expensive though..."
Comino your problem had nothing to do with booking.com. You're blaming the wrong company.
>>>Lost a lot money but learnt a lesson<<<It actually doesn’t appear so
"It has been interesting reading experiences from other travellers regarding trying to cancel a non refundable hotel reservation. It is unfortunate that the hotels have to take the full amount of the room. Perhaps the hotel chains could relent a bit, consider taking a portion of the cost of the reservation. That may satisfy the consumers. It has been an expensive lesson."
"Say you own a cake shop, and you take orders online. If those customers don’t come to collect their cake, would you as the owner of the cake shop be happy to wear some of the cost of those orders not being collected?It’s exactly the same scenario. Hotel rooms are perishable items"
">>>>It is unfortunate that the hotels have to take the full amount of the room. Perhaps the hotel chains could relent a bit, consider taking a portion of the cost of the reservation.>>>>All of us have a choice, we can book a cheaper non-refundable deal to save some money and realise and accept that hotels can and do stick to that no-refund Policy. Or we can choose to book a sometimes more expensive room deal allowing Free Cancellation as that wil allow us more flexibility if our plans change. Or some deals have a condition that if we choose to or need to cancel the hotel will keep the first nights reservation amount.There is usually a hotel deal to suit everybody. But if we choose to book a non-refundable deal then I don’t think we should expect hotels to relent."
"The cake shop analogy is a pretty good one form where I'm sitting. I've always understood that cheaper rates can be offered under a non refundable booking, as the hotel will know that they will be able to retain the amount form some reservations, and this will help to compensate them for the lower revenue they get via that rate.If the are not able to kepe the total amount from some of the reservatiosn that are made (ie those that do get cancelled for whatever reason) all that will mean is that they can't offer such discounted rates in the first place.Personally, I'd much rather have a choice of being able to have a discounted rate if I want one, or book a refundable rate if that suits me better."
"I've said it before. I'll say it again.DON'T assume the higher priced room is refundable and the lower one not. READ what you're agreeing to. Depending on the hotel,the day and the phases of the moon offers change. There are offers on booking.com all the time with better terms and lower prices. I saw a hotel last month. Breakfast and cancellation included was cheaper then no breakfast and no cancellation. It just means they put an offer on the room with breakfast and cancellation and didn't bother to put an offer on the no cancellation room.READ what you're AGREEING to. The worst thing that will happen is it'll bore you for thirty seconds."
"I like the cake shop analogy too. However, if the cake shop was able to sell the cake to someone else, I think that’s not ok to take my money too."
Selling your birthday cake to some one else means not selling one of the other cakes in the shop to that person. Unless the hotel is 100% there will still be an empty room.
"The whole point is that hotels will usually offer non refundable reservations at a lower rate than refundable ones. Often much lower. They can only do this because they know that there will be a small percentage of bookings that will be cancelled having already paid, and that there's a chance that they can resell the room. That offsets the lower revenue that they receive by way of offering cheaper rates.It doesn't matter whether the room can be or is sold again by the hotel. If you don't want to take a chance on the fact that you might have to cancel and lose your money, book a refundable rate. If you spot a hotel that doesn't offer lower rates for non refundable bookings, stay somewhere else. As nzentena said, though, you actually have to read what the booking is before you can make such decisions."
">>>However, if the cake shop was able to sell the cake to someone else<<<That’s IF it sells. The reason why major accommodation providers have never included that as a ‘clause’, is because it opens up a can of worms so to speak.There’s no guarantee it will sell, and the likelihood of complaints based on “it was X months before our arrival” or “it’s peak season so the demand is high and you could easily sell it” is endless. Which is why they often offset lower rates with ‘lock-in’ conditions, to guarantee the revenue. Less riskEdited: 2 years ago "
"Thats true KVE, it is difficult for a hotel to say whether or not it's resold if they are not already full. I was thinking from my (very) small business when I only have 1 of most room types and often are full. I wasn't trying to defend the non cancellable thing either.....I've heard endlessly the ""reasons"" why i should give a refund. Best one was just the other day when someone wanted to cancel because he had suddenly developed a major snoring problem and wanted to swap to a 2 bedroom unit which we didn't have and couldn't; understand why he couldn't cancel for free with 2 days to go......"
"I had a similar experience in Dar es salaam but my situation was unique in that after a non-refundable booking(which I cancelled- my mistake), I still checked in the same hotel on second non refundable booking and I paid twice effectively. The hotel refused to refund me as they insisted both were non-refundable bookings and a refund is not possible. Booking.com attempted to assist but the hotel was adamant that the policy was clear.l find it absurd because it is the same hotel, same period, same guest and same payment details! I have not problem with Booking com, they did their best to assist but the hotel was too hungry for the money."
"You cancelled a non refundable room so you don't get a refund, which is what you agreed to when you booked it. The fact you decided to rebook is irrelevant. It doesn't make your first booking a refundable one."
"Hastings T, <<<The hotel refused to refund me as they insisted both were non-refundable bookings and a refund is not possible.>>>A terrible practice in my opinion. Would you care to name this hotel in Dar Es Salaam so that future travellers can be aware and watch out for them in the future.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I'd like to see a hotel be a little flexible in circumstances such as this one, but they are entitled to enforce the conditions if they so wish. I'm afraid that being named here would not put me off staying in the hotel."
"I have had to cancel due to a family death. I have emailed the Hotel and they tried to take payment. I then emailed Booking.com to see if there was anything they could do. I do hope that they get back to me, I've always found the service to be helpful but I would hate this ruin my dealings with them."
364.You need to contact your travel insurers as it is them you have to claim from.
Why would it ruin your dealings with them? Booking.com have no say over hotel policies. Its your travel insurance you need to take it up with.
"I've always found Booking.com to be helfpul, but that doesn't mean that they can control what hotels do. They can ask, and they can try and persuade, but that's it. And I can do all of that myself."
"Are you sure that it was non-refundable when you booked the hotel. It has been reported, and booking.com , confirm this, that the refund conditions can change from minute to minute. The company say it is down to individual hotels who can do these changes at a whim. Not good."
On the contrary they don't change them on a whim. If you opt for a cheap non refundable and you agree to a binding contract . It's business. It's contracts you are making.If an hotel owner then releases you from that contract and refunds the money that is exceedingly good of them.
"When you book a hotel room at any rate, a contract is created. The terms and conditions can't be changed legally afterwards under most jurisdictions that I;m aware of. What a hotel can do is to change the rates and conditions regularly. There may be a special rate one day for 24 hours only, for instance."
"Have made the classic error of not checking dates properly when booking. After the usual run around of ring the hotel and the hotel saying ring Booking.com, finally was able to have the date corrected. will be able to open my credit card again."
It had nothing to do with booking.com. They can't change your dates. Only the hotel you booked with can do that.
"Yesterday (January 28th) I had to cancel the reservation I made through Booking.com. It was a non-refundable reservation for a room in London this May. Per booking.com: there was nothing they could do for me other than cancel the reservation and included the hotel phone # and e-mail. The hotel responded to my email that ""unfortunately our policy is non-refundable and non-amendable"". This is a huge chunk of change to loose, 660 British pounds! I don't know whether to laugh, cry or shoot myself.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Ruth,That’s the risk we all take when we book non-refundable rooms. It is the hotels themselves which set those policies and it sounds like that particular hotel is sticking to the non-refundable condition you booked and agreed to. Booking,com can’t do much if the hotel sticks to their policy, which they have a right to do. Some hotels are a little flexible but others aren’t.Many deals displayed on booking.com and other booking sites, and on hotels official websites themselves do offer Free Cancellation up until a specific time and date before arrival. Those are more flexible and should be booked if anyone isn’t totally sure they won’t want or need to cancel.If you “had to cancel” due to some event, natural disaster, weather event, delay or illness/accident can you claim under your Travel Insurance Policy? I hope you had Travel Insurance for this trip?That’s a lot of money to lose..."
Thanks for the tip Avanti-SG. I usually take out flight insurance but I havn't heard about an insurance for a cancelled trip in general. Will have to investigate this. I will be retiring soon and plan to travel more. I hope I don't make too many more goof-ups like this in the future!
"Certain specified events are covered by the delay and cancellation clauses in many Comprehensive Travel Insurance Policies. When choosing which one to buy it does take some time to read through all the attached Policy Documents and Product Disclosure statements to see what will be covered and what they exclude. It won’t cover if you just change your mind and don’t want to go on a trip, but some serious events can be covered. For example, a few years ago I had booked a flight overseas and all my accommodation (non-refundable). A flood hit my town the day before I was due to depart. All coaches out of town were cancelled as the roads were under water. I didn’t make my flight and missed my first night at a hotel. Luckily roads reopened the following afternoon so I was able to quickly book a new flight, reschedule the bus and get overseas (nearly 48 hours later then planned) to enjoy the rest of my trip. I was able to claim under the delay/Cancellation clause in my Travel Insurance as flood events were covered. I had to fill out forms online, email copies of documents and receipts. I got back about Australian$1000 which covered the cost of the second airline ticket I had to quickly buy and that first nights hotel booking I didn’t turn up for.If I had a basic policy I may not have been covered, so that’s why I choose the better Comprehensive Policy and had read it all carefully so knew I could likely be covered and make that claim.Sometimes they also cover things like if there is a death of a close family member so you have to cancel your trip, or if you have a serious accident before departure so have to cancel and can’t travel. Not everything is covered, and it’s usually only major events which may be covered. I also like being covered for airline delay over a certain number of hours, theft or loss of some cash or passport or important documents, if my trip is delayed through no fault of my own, and medical and dental cover if I am unwell during the trip.Every Policy is different, so it’s important to read them all carefully before buying and never assume you are covered for every little thing.I’m travelling overseas in 4 weeks time and have got my Policy organised. All my hotel bookings and flight are non-refundable, so if something major happens (and that event is specified in the Policy) I can claim. It’s very reassuring to have travel insurance cover. You never know what can happen in life...This topic in the link below is from the Bargain Travel forum. I started the topic on Travel Insurance and it has 16 pages full of replies with people’s experiences, hints and tips and links to information about choosing Travel Insurance. Have a read:-https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-…"
Wise words Avanti_SG and another good reminder on how travellers can protect themselves. Especially important for those choosing to book non-refundable rooms yet find themselves in a hole when life plans change and they can’t travel.
Thanks Avanti for your information. I'm checking out the Forum on Travel Insurance too. This is an area that I need to get much more acquainted with. Thanks- you've been a font of information.

"I've had to cancel a couple of trips myself. Illness or accident to myself or members of my family are the most common reason. My wife and I now buy an annual travel insurance policy, usually for Europe as that is where we now visit the most, though I have included the US sometimes. Here in the UK, the annual policies are very good value, but I don't know how things stand in other countries.As well as covering us for cancellation through illness and accident, we also have cover for things like accidents and illness while away, loss of baggage, theft, medical repatriation, and flight delays or cancellation. I also try and only book accommodation that is refundable until shortly before we are due to stay. This has been a very good decision a number of times, including last November when an unexpected medical issue caused us to cancel a short break within the UK. We managed to get our rail tickets refunded through the insurance, but just being able to cancel the hotel 4 days before the trip having paid nothing was excellent. I wish you well for your future travels and hope to see you around the forums. I'm retired, which is partly why I am here so much, and I;m determined ot carry on travelling for as long as I can. I didn't do as much travelling as I would have liked to have done while I was working :-)"
"Hi there, just to let you know that this pleasant attitude still lasts. The company I was about to fly with in March changed my flight from afternoon to very early morning. I didn't know how I would get to the airport so early and I had duties too. The clerk at booking.com called my hotel , explained and they agreed to cancel my normally non refundable reservation without penalty. It was extremely helpful. I couldnt thank them enough!"
I have an issue i booked an non refundable hotel didnt mean to but i did due to be there today but my father in law passed away in the early hours of this morning do u think id get a refund due to the circumstances as obviously me and my husband no longer want to go at this time
"Sorry for your loss.Whether a hotel refunds a non refundable room would be up to them, but why not just claim on your travel insurance?"
"You say the fee for no cancellation is cheaper but booking.com are advertising the same fare for free cancellation and no money back. This is a deliberate stance for conning people. When you cancell you then lose all your money and have no accommodation. Change or cancellation is at the full cost. Why would anyone chose no money back for the same money?? why is it advertised at the same cost? Is it to put doubt into the public that they have indeed selected the wrong one, made a mistake. Hotels are getting money over and over again for the one room!! I booked 12th January, cancelled 13th January and the booking was for six months in advance. This is a scam!!! Booking.com and Mena Plaza are being short sighted. This is a small world and with Social Media lets warn everyone. Also download BBC I Player series 6 and episode 9!"
Glynis It's entirely up to the hotel whether they charge more for a refundable rate than a non refundable rate but the different rates are made clear. It has nothing to do with booking.com. Of course the person booking just has to be careful to select the correct room but that is the same whoever you book with.
"Leyland has explained everything. Booking.com has nothing to do with the rates. >>>Hotels are getting money over and over again for the one room!! I booked 12th January, cancelled 13th January and the booking was for six months in advance<<<Common assumption. This is assuming that people will cancel over and over. This is also assuming that the cancelled room will sell. How far out you cancel has no bearing on whether a cancellation fee is charged or not. It’s a game of Tetris. It’s a sum of many parts. Hotels business is to lock in guaranteed revenue, not chance the likelihood of whether it will resell."
"If the hotel has decided to advertise identical rates for refundable and non refundable bookings,. it's clearly going to be advantageous to book the former rather than the latter. I can't really see why they would deliberately do such a thing, but perhaps someone can enlighten me?!Anyway, Glynis, sometimes I choose a refundable rate and sometimes I choose one that isn't refundable. It's all about circumstances for me. Whichever I do, I would never describe the enforcement of the terms of a contract as a scam. And that's exactly what happens. A hotel enforces the terms you agree to when you make the booking. They can choose to make an exception, but I wouldn't rely on it.Social media doesn't make a great deal of difference, I'm afraid. As you'll by the number of rubbish companies who are still going strong despite having warnings plastered all over the web, including on social media."
I've seen fully cancelable rooms for less then prepaid. All I can think of is the hotel decided to lower the price on those rooms to encourage bookings. They could have changed every single price but instead they decided to change just the one.If you see a cancelable (which is different then refundable. A refund implies prepayment) for the same price or less book it. It's up to you to read the various offers. No different then some hotels have different rates for rooms with or without a bathroom. Or with or without breakfast. Or for a different part of the hotel. Read what you're electronically signing!
"It is a big hotel scam. If you book a room with the idea you can cancel, but you get led through 1000's of choices of rooms. I just want the room i got in the search. But you cannot get the result of the search, you must choose one from the next page. If I made a mistake because of this unclear process I should have at least an hour to correct my fault. What are the GB regulations for buying at the door or online. And why should a hotel get 600 pound whilst not delivering any service/product. So this hotel made 600 pound in half an hour without doing anything. That is a scam! If you provide service, you should get paid. If an hotel has two month to re-list the room, then maybe a small penalty (1 night?) is in order. I hate booking.com for this. In the future use other websites that negotiate and help with this. I will not mention which. It is probably fine for me to let some homeless people to stay there instead. I am not checking in, so I am not to blame. I only paid for the room (and cannot get out of this). Cleaning of bedbugs/cockroaches must be done at their expense.Ohw.. and it only works one way. Because if they overbook a room, then you won't get 600pound extra from them. So it's win/win for them everytime.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I'm sorry, John, all I can understand is that you made a mistake and it's cost you money. What is it that Booking.com have done wrong?"
"@389 (JohnThough)<<. I hate booking.com for this. >>>You hate booking.com because you made a reservation contract with a hotel that you didn't understand and/or decided to change later but were unable to because of T&C you agreed to with the hotel. That is little different to hating Amazon.com after purchasing a book from an online seller there, and later deciding it was the wrong book and wanting the book dealer to refund you. If the seller chooses not, would you hate Amazon.com for this? Try to keep in mind that you used booking.com as a web-based platform for making your transaction. However, that transaction is an agreement between you and the hotel who offered the rooms there. You are the buyer. The hotel is the seller. Booking.com is simply the marketplace.Further, Booking.com can try to intercede which they will do. However, they can't control the hotels and force them to allow break in service terms simply because people sometimes want/need changes to be made after booking non-refundable hotel reservations. This is why there are free-cancelation rooms available with many of the hotels which offer rooms on booking.com as well. Yes, they do cost more but they allow you to break agreement you are making with hotels and get out scot-free if you like or need. This might be a better option for you to try in the future."
">>>And why should a hotel get 600 pound whilst not delivering any service/product<<<Why should the hotel miss out on revenue for a perishable product because of consumer carelessness?>>>So this hotel made 600 pound in half an hour without doing anything. That is a scam! If you provide service, you should get paid. If an hotel has two month to re-list the room, then maybe a small penalty (1 night?) is in order<<<The hotel made 600 pounds for the room reservation over the dates of your stay, it has nothing to do with the 30 minutes it took for you to realise your mistake. As for the hotel having two months to re-list the room, what guarantees are there they will sell? If they don't sell, will you then guarantee the payment? No. So the hotel loses out."
"My search dates were correct, but when i had paid and they sent me the itenerary, I found out it was a different month...actually I was supposed to check in the very next day, and I was still in South Africa! Miles away from New York. I got the shock of my life because I am only going to America next month. I hate loosing money, I so wish booking.com can do something , but they keep lying to me"
So you didn't bother to check the dates you were booking before confirming? They can only pass on the information that you put in the system.
"I was a great customer at Booking.com unfortunately , I tried to cancel reservation for 460!!! pounds . The cancellation didnt get though . Tech error , and now they are trying to charge us the full amount . the booking is in 3 weeks time . Booking.com is a rip off ! plus they charge hotels so much for their service"
"Booking.com don't and aren't charging you. It's the hotel. They dont charge the hotels ""so much for their service"". The hotels pay an agreed percentage. No one forces them to advertise on booking,com."
"I don't care how much a hotel has to pay Booking.com, Avila. It's none of my concern, it's between the two parties involved. As LeyLand says, no one forces a hotel to work with this site.LeyLand is also correct that Booking.com aren't charging you. It's the hotel."
I have a 2 night break coming on Friday 2nd March in Llandudno with a non refundable room unfortunately all there rooms say non refundable.due to this weather I rang the hotel to be told there is no think I could do.i just wanted to move the date not cancel it till weather cleared
"Unfortunately Tracey that’s how it goes when you book a non-refundable, non-changeable room. You are taking a gamble on nothing in your life changing before you travel and stay. The hotelier has given you a lower rate based on you accepting restrictions on your booking. The hotel will not wish to have empty rooms this weekend and lose revenue."
"HI All,Just sharing my latest experience. After reading from here, i tried calling Booking.com for my country to cancel my non refundable cancellation for hotel booking which i accidentally booked with the wrong month!All the person asked from me is my confirmation number and pin, and she called the hotel on my behalf to do the cancellation, while i waited on the line.Within few minutes, I was told the hotel agreed to cancel for free and was told to wait for the confirmation email from booking.com. Almost immediately after the conversation, i received an email notification saying my booking is successfully cancelled for free!!!"
"That’s good that the hotel was flexible and allowed the cancellation of your non-refundable deal. Some hotels won’t and they stick to the non-refundable Policy. Booking,com contacting them is good, but they can’t make the decision. It’s up to the hotel involved."
"It's always good when Booking.com help out by contacting the hotel, but it's absolutely correct that they can't make the decision on whether to cancel or amend a booking as a gesture of goodwill. That is down to the accommodation. If a hotel is not prepared ot cancel or amend a non refundable an dnon changeable booking, then unfortunately you are stuck. If they are, though, that's brilliant.Edited: 2 years ago "

"Of course you can't sue the hotel. They upheld their side of the contract. It's you that broke it. It's not the hotels fault the flights were cancelled anymore than it was yours. You don't want to lose out but you think they should? You booked a cheaper non refundable rate, lost that gamble and had to cancel. Hopefully your travel insurance covers for consequential loss so you can make a claim that way.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Pallavi, did you read the terms and conditions before you booked? Do they say that a refund will be given in the event of adverse weather? If not, then I’m afraid your only recourse is to claim on your travel insurance. Going to Court will cost you money, even if you use the Small Claims Court. My guess is you’d have very little chance of success. Non refundable is just that I’m afraid, that’s why it’s cheaper. The fact that you couldn’t travel is not the responsibility of the accommodation provider."
Thanks for the reply to bothThe policies says 30% of the total price if cancel after reservation and the total price if cancel in the 7 days before arrival.Edited: 2 years ago 
"""total price if I cancel in the 7 days before arrival""You cancelled 2 days before arrival.So even if it was a refundable booking you weren't due a refund"
"Thanks for reply,I guess i will leave itPallavi"
"That's the right decision, I think. The hotel doesn't have to refund you because of bad weather. You've asked them, Booking.com have asked them, and the answer was no both times. Time to leave it, I think"
I went to book a hotel 2 days ago and my internet stop working. I did not get a confirmation on my I pad. So the next day I went to book a different acomodation and last night I end up with two bookings from bookings .com for the same date. And both a not refundable. I always book with bookings .com. But they can not help me to cancel any of my bookings. What can I do and the booking is more than 2 months away?
"Kon too late now, but you should have at least checked in ""manage my booking"" All you can do is contact the hotels to see if one of them would be willing to refund or perhaps defer your booking. But why didn't you try to book your original hotel?"
"Kon n, Booking confirmations are emailed through property accounts immediately when you reserve through booking.com. This would have been a quick and easy sign that you already had a booking in hand. As mentioned above, you could have also quickly and easily seen your existing reservation by simply looking at your Account 'Manage My Bookings' page. They are all shown for you to look over after reservations have been made. Again, by taking the time to do this, you could have quickly avoided this mistake. As Rawtalent suggests, be very polite and ask the two hotels if one wouldn't mind cancelling your booking due to the your booking error. Perhaps one will oblige you."
"I've certainly had good results occasionally when asking hotels for help. Nothing can be guaranteed, but being very polite, apologetic and humble seems to get results for me."
we acidently booked a room twice and they will not refund us
"426.When you say ""they"" you do mean the accommodation, don't you?"
"It's all down to the accommodation, nessa. Some will be sympathetic to a mistake like yours, others won't be. There's nothing you can do except ask."
I.m trying to cancel a reservation.
You would do that on the booking.com website. Or maybe there's a link in the emailed confirmation you received and it takes you to their site to Manage your Booking.
430.Go to Manage my Booking and cancel.
"I want to cancel a 28 day booking for an apartment in Argentina. Booking.com has a policy of communicating with hosts only via their website. When I asked the host to provide pictures of the exterior of the building and of the surrounding street, he gave me his phone # and asked me to call him. I told him I don't speak his language, so he then suggested I contact him via whatsapp so it can translate for us - booking.com's website translates too so I don't understand his request. I felt really uncomfortable about it, and about his resistance to adding a couple of pics to his listing. I also asked him if the neighborhood is safe, and he told me the apartment is safe because there are bars on the window. I am a nervous wreck now. I'm uncomfortable about the host, and now about staying in a place that i didn't know has bars on the windows. Has anyone had any similar experience? I'm a solo, female traveler, and I need to feel safe. Do you think booking.com would help me out in this situation?Sharon"
"Have you asked Booking.com, Sharon? I don't kno what they'd do for you, or how successful they'd be, because i rarely book apartments and never through Booking.com. I suspect that they won't be able to force the owner to do anything he doesn't want to do, as is the case with hotels."
"I booked a hotel on booking.com for the upcoming world cup in a city called Nizhny Novgorod for $730 Australian. When I booked I am almost positive it said free cancellation because at the time I wasn't even certain I wanted to stay there. Well they charged my credit card straight away and as it turns out I cancelled when I couldn't confirm transport to that city. They won't refund a cent and this booking is 3 months away. I am pleading with booking.com to reason with this motel, 3 months away seems crazy they have to charge me the full amount. they said they will try and ring the hotel but I don't like my chances. I have paid for these 2 rooms so should they be able to give me my room back? How can a cancellation fee be that excessive??"
"434.You need to check the terms and conditions associated with your booking. You should be able to find this under the Manage my Booking tab.If the room is ""non refundable""then the Motel is within their legal rights to keep the money paid."
">>>3 months away seems crazy they have to charge me the full amount. they said they will try and ring the hotel but I don't like my chances.

How can a cancellation fee be that excessive??<<<Unfortunately, 3months for special events such as the World Cup is not uncommon. It wasn’t long ago that Sydney NYE used to have 90 day cancellation policies attached."
"432.I assume you read the reviews about this property and were satisfied with them...otherwise you wouldn't have booked for 28 days, right?Is something being lost in translation between you an the owner? I for one would feel a lot safer staying in an establishment that has ""bars"" on the windows, this is something very common when staying in Spanish properties - so why not Argentina as well?Booking.com encourages hosts to have prior contact with their guests, so nothing unusual there.We read many complaints from people who have no phone number for their host, then arrive late and can't make contact! You have a phone number, surely that is a positive."
"Maybe somebody could suggest what to do in this case:Last month we booked a room for 4 nights in the end of March. We picked non-refundable reservation as we had no doubt we gonna stay in that Hotel. Until we arrived. The hotel could not provide us clean room and offered to cancel reservation. I requested cancellation of my reservation on the the same day and received the confirmation from booking.com the next day with the following text: ""We approached **** Hotel on your behalf, and are happy to confirm that they have agreed to cancel your reservation at no charge. You will receive a cancellation email with more details shortly.""We did not receive any email till today, however, I tried to reach both property and the booking.com via email and did not receive the answer.Today we called booking.com and they say that they cannot do anything for us because:1) Our booking wasn't cancelled in the account2) Our booking was last month, and they can help only on the issues of current month.What should we do now?What is the difference between requesting free cancellation and making cancellation of the booking?"
">>>We approached **** Hotel on your behalf, and are happy to confirm that they have agreed to cancel your reservation at no charge<<<If this is in writing, it’s almost airtightDispute the charge with your CC provider"
"Yes, that's my advice as well. Pass the issue on to your card provider."
Hi I just made two reservations at the Bay Breeze and I would like to cancel one of them please my name is Vanessa thing thank you very much I apologize it was a mistake on my area I don't have money to pay for all this
"Vanessa P, You are posting in a public form at TripAdvisor. This is not booking.com. You will need to access your booking.com account on that website and cancel from there. Note that non-refundable is what it is. The hotel has the right to charge you for having agreed to the contract terms & conditions as part of your original booking."
Cash please only need one room thanks
"Vanessa, this is not booking,com Customer service. This is a Public forum on TripAdvisor where all of us TripAdvisor members chat about travel and our holidays and try to give each other advice on travel problems.If you want to cancel bookings then read the Terms and Conditions in your confirmation email from booking.com to see if you are eligible for a refund and then contact booking.com."
"Sometimes, Vanessa, the mistakes that we make cost us. Errors have certainly cost me money in the past. Whether this is the case for you will depend on whether your booking was non refundable and if so, on how sympathetic the hotel will be to your request for a refund. Please prepare yourself for the possibility that you will not get a refund at all."
"I made a reservation on Friday night April 13 through booking.com for the covered bridge river view lodge in New Hampshire for June 30 until July 2, I read really bad reviews of the place after I made the reservation, my husband got scared of reading nightmares that people tell about the place and we wanted to cancel, yesterday we called to cancel and the lady that answered the phone insulted him and called him communist for trying to cancel, and tried to force me to go by saying they won’t reimburse my money, I called booking.com and they said the hotel has a policy of non reimbursement and can’t help me, this is awful that a place like that is even posted in web sites."
"ericaalvarez18, It is an unfortunate situation but why did you agree to the nonrefundable reservation without researching the hotel first? Best to chalk this one up to a learning experience and move on."
"<<ericaalvarez18>>As they only seem to sell non refundable rooms, at least through booking.com, why didn't you do some research first? You cannot book a non refundable room and then expect a refund."
"The sure way to find unhappiness is to not check out hotels before making a reservation, and then to make a non refundable reservation to boot. I'm afraid you have approached the trip in a back to front way, erica. Make sure that you're happy with a hotel before you make a reservation. I do that even when I make a refundable booking."

Unfortunately I have not had a good experience with booking.com and more specifically the hotel property. Booking.com was initially very helpful and after a three way call with the property owner they said they would like to make a one time exception because everyone makes a mistake and the property owner absolutely refused. The property owner has been completely awful about this entire situation.
"Erica T, From what you describe it seems like booking.com went out of their way to try and help you. Unfortunately, when you agree reservations terms with a hotel that posts on the booking.com website, you are bound by those terms. Glad to hear that booking.com staff tried to intercede and act on your behalf with the property owner. Sorry to hear the property owner wasn't interested in letting you out of your reservation agreement. At least you tried."
"Can anyone help us We booked a hotel through booking.com to our error it was non refundable but they returned our money as we wanted to pay once we were at the hotel.We went back and forth with a couple of email’s and were just waiting on confirmation if this booking was still active with Booking.com and always maintained we would take the booking in March 2018We finally got an email & on our booking.com a/c stating it had been CANCELLED.Now they have taken the money of over £1000 out of our account a week before the intended date Booking.com are not interested and have said that WE should contact the Hotel direct with different dates but we live 7,000 away Should we involve the solicitors or go straight to small claims court"
Do you anything in writing to say you’d get a refund? If not then the t&c will apply.
453.Do you mean that you were trying to move the booking to Match 2019? Have they taken the money as pre payment for that dste?
"<<Should we involve the solicitors or go straight to small claims court>>I can't see either being particularly impressed as you've made no attempt to resolve this yourself with the hotel that took your payment. It appears you didn't even contact them to find out the status of your booking. I don't know why it makes a difference how far away you live. You can still contact them, and at the end of the day, it's them you have a contract with and only they can sort it.That said, I'm somewhat confused by when you were/are going and why the hotel refunded on you a non refundable room, just so you could pay on arrival."
We have not contacted the Hotel as it was booking.com who we made the booking with.Booking.com said the booking was cancelled so why would we contact at the Hotel when its booked through them ?Surely is that not enough!We have a very long paper trail with booking.com When cancelled there was no mention any payment been taken or to contact the hotel at that point
"It may sound pedantic, but you book through Booking.com, not with them. The booking goes straight to the accommodation, and it is they who take the payment, or give a refund, not Booking.com. I would be very surprised indeed if it was Booking,com that took money out of your account.Distance should be no object to contacting the hotel. It's not as if your only option is to visit them personally to discuss the matter. Assuming that it is the hotel that have charged you, then it's something that you have to sort out with them. You could try and contact your bank, but I'd guess that they wouldn't be able to help you if the hotel told them that you had made a non refundable reservation."
I like to kiss on my reservation at the Motel 6 please for tonight for Vanessa pain and I'm trying to book at the Bay Breeze Inn for tonight please thank you at booking.com please call me or text
"Vanessa, as we mentioned to you when you asked before we are not booking.com. This is a forum for people chatting about travel. Nobody here works for Booking.com Customer Service. You are on the Tripadvisor website. It has no connection to booking.com.This blue link is Booking.com:- www.booking.comPlease contact them directly.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I needed to cancel a booking after being told by the hotel that I had up to the day before arrival to cancel free of charge, I called up the hotel the day before to cancel. They explained that it would only be free via cancellation through the website i had used to book initially. The website was trying to charge me for cancellation, I contacted the website directly and they were very helpful. I managed to cancel my booking free of charge, after they contacted the hotel direct to advise they were happy to wave any cancelation fees from there end."
461.The hotel was correct with their advice.
This has exactly what has happened to us but on Hotels.com n while we speak to Hotel directly they say they are willing to do but hotels.com has to initiate n when you contact hotels.com they say Hotel refused. We have spent last 48 hours making umpteen local calls n international calls n no one is willing to help. We are struck with roughly 1000 dollars we have already paid!
Probably would have been better to post on one of the many topics about Hotels.com rather than this booking.com one. The companies are not connected.
">>>This has exactly what has happened to us but on Hotels.com n while we speak to Hotel directly they say they are willing to do but hotels.com has to initiate n when you contact hotels.com they say Hotel refused.

If the hotel is willing to cooperate, get it in writing.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Gosh I wish I had discovered this site earlier. I have had a bad experience with Bookings.com after NOT booking into a Castlemaine (Vic) establishment which looked like something out of the depths of your worst nightmare in Delhi. It was an absolute disgrace. Dirty, garish and YET described on their website with such charm!! AArav Cottage, Castlemaine, avoid it at all costs and don't believe any of the supportive comments (if there are any) - as we did."
"The condition of the hotel has nothing to do with Booking.com. They do not manage, audit, vet, or inspect properties"
So basically you are saying booking.com can advertise a rubbish tip as a palace and you have no grounds for complaint when you arrive to your rubbish tip? That doesn’t seem fair that booking.com have no liability for condition of places they advertise
"Loretta,When you searched on other sites for this accommodation (AArav Cottages) what where it’s reviews like on those sites? I just searched for the property on booking.com and reviews seem mixed, with some nice comments and quite a few complaints about cleanliness and facilities.It definitely looks “garish” but you would have known that before booking by looking at the photos of cluttered rooms, mismatched furniture, fussy antiques, olden-days style, brightly coloured painted walls. Some of the rooms look to have different types and colours of fabric, curtains, cushions, rugs. Gosh those photos made my eyes sore....I’ve never seen so many colours and styles together. The place is described in some reviews as quirky.Why did you choose to book it after seeing those photos and reading lots of reviews?"
">>>So basically you are saying booking.com can advertise a rubbish tip as a palace and you have no grounds for complaint when you arrive to your rubbish tip?<<<They can only go by the information and pictures the hotel provides. Think of booking platforms like a newspaper. The newspaper does not test, vet or audit products suppliers want to advertise. No different.This is why experienced travellers always recommend you cross reference multiple sites, and ask advice on the local forums of your destination"
"As I said the photos presented at the time of my booking had none of those garish items.it showed almost a heritage building. What a shock on our arrival. In fact my 2 friends and I were quite ""spooked"" by the whole place. We could not find any staff and left as soon as we could. When the Manager (?) telephoned me to see if I was spending the night - I told him what had happened, but I still got a $200 debit on my Credit Card. Very shabby behaviour."
Yes thanks. Won't use this site again. We were certainly duped.
"Once again...It's got nothing to do with Booking.com. Its not difficult to understand. You could experience this through any other site or even unscrupulous hotels' own website. Its entirely your prerogative, but if you keep ignoring the advice about cross referencing multiple resources, I fear you'll be duped again sometime in the future"
"i know that this post is old but just would like to add to it that I just found myself in the same situation, and a Booking.com representative called Ivan K contacted the hotel and managed to get me a full refund (it was more than 1000 euros!) for which I am eternally grateful. Ivan said to contact Booking.com via phone before cancelling the booking through their website, as they usually have more power of negotiation with the hotels. A very happy Booking.com customer! I will use them again (and will be more careful with cancellation deadlines!"
"Did you speak to the hotel first about a refund, before contacting booking.com?"
>>>they usually have more power of negotiation with the hotels<<<They actually have zero power of negotiation over the hotels. It is always and entirely at the discretion of the hotel management
Agreed. Ivan must be misinformed. Or maybe they have reached this erroneous conclusion themselves.
"I accidentally booked a room that has no cancellation, i think i was overtired and read the wrong tab on my web browser. Anyway, even 5-6 months in advance they will not cancel which is frustrating, but not much i can do, just be VERY careful and reading all terms and conditions."
A hotel has the right to make customers stick to the terms they agreed when they booked with them.
"Your advice is good. I never book anything when I'm tired. I wait until I am more alert. It's vital to read the T&C's, and to understand what it is you'll be getting into.Even so, I've sometimes made mistakes. When I do, I curse and rage at myself, ask for a favour, and accept the situation if the answer is no."
I recently used booking.com to book a hotel in Cádiz Regio2 - I was not made away by the Hotel or booking.com that payment would be taken at the time of booking and no refund if the booking was amended or cancelled monies were deducted from my account £675 - there was no assistance from booking.com to either consider the lack of information regarding the Hotel policies or exactly the arrangement - when I requested for my account to closed I was advised that accounts can never be closed - complete rip off from both the hotel and BC
"chris, all the policies, and Terms and Conditions are set out on the booking.com page you look at when choosing a hotel room. Things either say “non-refundable” or “Free Cancellation” or other descriptions next to each room type so you can click on that and read and know exactly what you are booking, and can then decide what’s best for you and then book that one. Often on a booking.com page about a particular hotel there is information under a heading “Policies” or “General Information” or some other information below all the available rooms information. Sometimes it may even say something about “pre-authorisation” and explain that payment can be taken straight away.Exactly which hotel name is this? Maybe some of us can take a look on booking.com and see if we can see the information you missed."
"The cancellation policy is determined by the room that you select. To say you weren't told is just not correct. I've had a look at that property and the information is very clear, but whether you chose to read it I don't know."
"Oh, I missed seeing the name of the hotel, so it’s Regio2 hotel. Yes, I just now looked on the booking,com APP on my iPad and can see various rooms, some are non-refundable and when you click on that word it clearly states the terms and also about pre-payment.I’m guessing Chris just didn’t see or click on things to find out. Maybe have another look Chris and then you will know how next time."
Thank you for your comments appreciate the rates and terms differ - I booked a refundable room as our plans were fluid but monies were taken at the time of booking and the problem is there are refundable rooms - I am taking legal advice on this and despite the many years of using booking .com similar to other travelers the service has worked well this is a first and hopefully last keep you posted re progress but be careful to all on hidden information regarding cancellation charges being applied by individual hotels to guests cancelling or amending bookings
"<<I booked a refundable room as our plans were fluid but monies were taken at the time of booking and the problem is there are refundable rooms - I am taking legal advice on this>>If money was taken then that is down to the hotel. If the room you booked said no prepayment, payment at the hotel, then the hotel shouldn't have take payment, but as they state ""Please note that the property reserves the right to pre-authorise credit cards prior to arrival.""It doesn't sound like a refundable room. It sounds like selected the wrong room type in error and booked a low rate room."
"It's the hotel that has charged you and the hotel that is not refunding you as you think they ought. I can't see anywhere that Booking.com is involved in this apart form their apparent refusal to contact the hotel for you.I've never had any issue with information not being displayed on Booking.com. It's always been as clear as day to me.If you have proof that you booked a fully refundable room, and that you have cancelled it in accordance with the period provided for free cancellation, contact your credit card provider and ask them to help you get your money back."
Many thanks for the information this is first in the many years of using BC that an issue has occurred legal advice is being sought and in contact with bank for the unauthorised payment being made - I needed to share with TA as in most things in life things are not always perfect thanks again
"Sharing via TA is excellent, it's why I use the site. I can see refundable room rates on Booking.com as of now. They are clearly marked as no pre payment required according to the blurb. If the hotel is not going to honour those terms, they need to stop offering them."
"never use booking.com ever again. It contains a malware/virus. You can search on internet for ""booking.com virus"" and you will find how to delete it. Hope anyone could use this, because it can steal a lot of money from you."
"Never use booking.com ever again, because it contains a malware/virus. You can search for ""booking.com virus""on google to find out how to delete it. I hope I can help anyone with this, because it can steal alot of your moneyGood Luck :)"
"Maybe you should just lock your computer down better? Booking.com aren't causing the redirects. It's done by an adware application on your computer, and its got there because you've not noticed it attached to some free software you downloaded."
"I would be well and truly amazed if the malware came from Booking.com in reality. My wife and I tried to clean up my brother in law's PC for him as he had downloaded all sorts of free stuff and his machine had become infected from somewhere. He has never used Booking.com at all, whereas I have use dit a lot and my PC is as clean as a whistle."
An update to my situation where the motel wouldn’t refund my money on accomodation in russia World Cup I booked in advance. After writing and ringing motel direct several times and hounding them they agreed to refund half my money. It pays off to be persistent sometimes
"A 50% refund on a non refundable booking is a good result in my book. But if you had a refundable rate, then you shoiuld get it all back.Did you ever check the confirmation to see what rate you had booked?"
"On the website I am positive it said refundable but I made the mistake of not checking the confirmation email. It had no mention of refundable on the email. I have to wear the loss cos I have no proof. Lesson learnt, not going up let it ruin a holiday"
"Yes, I think that without any proof you'll have to absorb the loss. Concentrate on making sure you have a great trip instead :-)"
Why not contact credit card and cancel transaction?
#498Not sure which of the previous posts you are responding to.A claim on your credit card provider may not be appropriate or valid. You certainly can’t fall back on a cc claim just because you change your mind and no longer have use of the non-refundable hotel room that was booked.
"Exactly. A credit card charge back is not a get out of jail free card. It is intended as a way of holding companies to account when they mess up and don't provide the goods and services that have been paid for. It is not intended as free insurance for changing your mind, and should never be used that way in my view."
"I booked a hotel by mistake (wrong location) cancelled it within half hour The money was taken out of my account the day after. Contacted the hotel they were very unhelpful. Booking.com tried to get a refund for me but was unsuccessful.it was three months in advance so I’m sure the room would’ve filled by then , but there was no chance"
"If it was a non refundable room then you weren't entitled to a refund. It makes no difference whether the room was re sold or not, and whether it was cancelled within 30 minutes or 30 days."
"It doesn't matter how quickly you cancel, or how far in advance you booked, a non refundable reservation is exactly what it says. Of course, a hotel can always choose to exercise discretion, but they are not obliged to do so. Many of them offer significantly cheaper non efundable rates in the full knowledge that they will be able to sell some of them twice when guests cancel. That is precisely why they can offer discounted rate sin the first place."
"Dear all,I have a huge problem that i am trying to solve. I booked an apartment in Malaga for 12 nights and made a mistake with non-refundable reservation. I realized later that was non-refundable!!! After i contacted the property they agreed i pay only 150 euro for the reservation but didn't say if i am going to pay the whole cost 916 Euro.They said to contact booking.com and call them on the phone. In my country Macedonia there is no booking.com agency. Can anyone help me...is there a free number i can call? Any e-mail i can write and to whom?Thank you in advance.Neda"
"If you booked through Booking.com, then you should be able to contact them through that website. Is this not working for you for some reason?"
"Can someone please tell me why after realising they've made a non-refundable reservation, they then want to cancel? This scenario is cited so frequently on the forums. Why not let the booking stand? The place must have fitted the bookers requirements for the booking to have been made."
"I cancelled a hotel within the appropriate time, 6 months ago actually. Never thought anything more about it, but just returned from hols and have been charges £1000 no show charge as they say I never cancelled, booking .com said I have no bookings yet this booking has magically appeared on Booking .com as a no show. I cannot prove I cancelled because the email was so old it disappeared off my computer. What to do?"
"The email may have disappeared off your computer, but it should still be retrievable."
">>>Can someone please tell me why after realising they've made a non-refundable reservation, they then want to cancel?<<<I agree, but I think it could be a case of bad story tellling and there’s more details which they’ve omitted - accidentally or otherwise.But yes, it seems to get mentioned frequently as the reason for canceling"
"<<I cannot prove I cancelled because the email was so old it disappeared off my computer. What to do?>>You mean you deleted it? I never delete anything I've cancelled until about 6 months after the departure date, just in case. If it was in your inbox it would still be there. I've got emails in mine going back to 2012."
"Emails don't disappear unless you delete them. Like LeyLand, I've got emails in my inbox and various folders dating back more than five years. Some are older, in fact, than my current PC."
"You are very lucky to get a full refund! I made the same mistake. I booked through Booking.com, accommodation at Quest on Scarborough (Perth, W Australia) 7 months' in advance. Within 24hrs, Quest on Scarb charged the full amount $2324. Within 24hrs, I cancelled it but they refused a refund due to 'their strict policy,' because it's a 'special rate.' I'm sure they could quickly fill up their bookings in 7 months. They were happy for me to cancel but also happy to take the full amount for nothing (ie there is no accomm reservation). I've never had accomm charge me full amount 7 months' in advance. Usually accommodation would only charge after check in. Booking.com was able to negotiate a credit with Quest, which is better than nothing but I was disappointed because I thought they would refund on ""good will"" and for any future business. I also think it's unreasonable to refuse a refund given that the booking is made for 7 months' in advance and it was cancelled within 24hrs."
Sounds like you booked a prepay non-refundable rate. Often the cheapest but these come with conditions such as being non-refundable. Good to hear that Booking.com reached out to the hotel and obtained a concession for you.
"First and foremost, the conditions are enforced by the hotel, not Booking.com>>>but I was disappointed because I thought they would refund on ""good will"" and for any future business<<<If you had a prior history of frequenting that hotel, you’d have some grounds for that argument. But you are more than likely an domestic inbound leisure guest with no prior history. Additionally Scarborough is non-CBD non-corporate destination. ‘Goodwill’ on such a profile is money out the window, so from a business perspective, the hotel made the right call. The one thing they could have done is given you the change-of-date alternative before it went back and forth.>>>I also think it's unreasonable to refuse a refund given that the booking is made for 7 months' in advance and it was cancelled within 24hrs<<<It doesn’t matter how far out you cancel. There is no guarantee the hotel will fill. This is just an assumption. It is also not about one reservation. They open a can of worms by not enforcing a stated policy. So in such a scenario, would you be willing to guarantee the hotel payment if they don’t hit 100% occupancy over your dates? I’m guessing not."
"Not only is there no guarantee that the hotel will resell the room, even 7 months out, but the only way that they can afford to offer special discounted rates is because they know that some will cancel and forfeit whatever they had paid. It's all part of a carefully thought out business and pricing strategy.It's unwise to rely on assumptions. It's much better to expect that T&C's will be strictly enforced. If you find that exceptions are made, then that's great, but wher eit happens it's a gesture of goodwill, not a right."
"Just read this forum about booking.com. We find the service is great. When I had to change bookings, cancelling one hotel for a more suitable one for disabled daughter, Booking.com were so helpful that I will always book through them."
"I have never had any issues with them either, 875patricia, though I prefer to book direct if it's not too disadvantageous financially. Most people who complain about non refundable bookings either didn't realise what they were booking, made a mistake and booked the wrong rate, or simply don't understand what Booking.com is or what it does."
I mistakenly used HOTEL PLANNER and I can comfortably say they are HORRIBLE. I called to cancel within 3 minutes of booking a room I wanted to stay in a weeks time and it was already over. I never checked into the room and I never got a refund even after one month of disputing the claim in all politeness. What pisses me off is that I can't even remember seeing non-refundable in the terms and conditions. It only appeared on my receipt. Maybe I didn't look well because the rate was clearly not cheap considering the price of other hotels in the city f Boston
Is HOTEL PLANNER linked to Booking.com in some way. Irabor?
"#518If your issue is with Hotel Planner, why are you posting on this thread about Booking.com?It sounds like you selected the cheaper option of a non-refundable room. It really does not matter when you cancel and how much notice you give the hotel/OTA, the booking is non-refundable - no money back.If you think that your travel plans may change, or if you are unsure about the hotel and want flexibility to cancel, better to book a corresponding room rate which allows for these options."
"I somehow doubt they’ll come back to post, but I’d be interested in how they found HotelPlanner. They are better known for wholesale group bookings, not for FIT’sEdited: 2 years ago "
Can someone please help me cancel a hotel that I booked accidentally
"Jemal, nobody here works for booking,com so we can’t help you cancel anything. We are just travellers and TripAdvisor members like you.You will need to go on the booking.com website and cancel it in there or maybe there is a link within the confirmation emailed you received after booking. Was it a booking with Free Cancellation where you can get your money back, or was it a cheaper non-refundable one?"
"It's unfortunate that you made a booking by accident. If you accidentally booked a non refunmdable rate, there's a big chance that your money is gone. I've always found it easy to cancel on the Booking.com website."
"I accidentally booked a non refundable room for the end of August. I called booking.com within 5 minutes and they were happy to cancel. However, Hilton Brighton Metrople are refusing to help by either amending the booking or cancelling it... any advice please"
"525.If you can't use the booking yourself, maybe you can transfer it to someone else."

But they do. People all the time on the Air Travel forum claiming “scam” because an airline or a dodgy online flight booker won’t refund the full price of a non-refundable ticket they bought.
"Avanti is right. Personally,I really don't understand how so many people seem to accidentally lock themselves in to both hotel rooms and flights that they want to cancel almost immediately but can't because they are non refundable. Mean, we all mistakes every now and again, but this seems to be a big problem area, and I don't know why."
"Hi, I have a similar problems. I booked a hotel, cancellation was free to 25th of July and non-refundable since that date. I was supposed to travel with my siste, but unfortunately she is in high risk pregnancy and is banned from air travel thus I need to cancel whole vacation. It already costs a tons of money so I am trying not to lose even more. Amount has not been deducted from my card yet. My question is - if I dont have sufficient amount on my card (which I did not transfered on purpose, but due to medical bills I truly dont have), will be the hotel able to withdraw them? Is there any chance they wont charge me at all?"
Problem is that when airline or hotel makes a mistake you get nothing :(
530.Have you tried claiming on yours and your sister's travel insurance?
"You've entered into a contact. Not having the money in your account won't change that. Some hotels sell their debts on to be collected. As Rawtalent says, can't you claim on the travel insurance?"
My parents booked a hotel at nNovotel Worsley brow they were taken ill and had booked two rooms and could not go they lost their money and Novotel couldn't have cared less
"Julia,Can’t your parents claim on their Travel Insurance? That’s one of the things it’s for, to help recoup money if people are forced to cancel due to unexpected health events. Or didn’t they take out Travel Insurance?Booking something which is non-refundable is usually cheaper (and that’s why many book those deals, I know I often do). But there is a risk involved, if something prevents you from travelling you know it’s non-refundable. That’s what we all agree to when we book these deals, so we should not be surprised if some hotels won’t budge on those terms and conditions.Sometimes it’s better to book a deal offering Free Cancellation up until a specific time and date before arrival as that gives you more flexibility if you want or need to cancel for any reason. Maybe your parents could consider booking a Free Cancellation deal next time they travel, just in case.Edited: 2 years ago "
i am in the same situation now ... what did u do ?

Same problem I booked Clayton Hotel Dublin Airport and made a mistake booking.com refused a refund. Worst company. I am never using them again. Absolute disgusting customer service.
Anthony E.Which same problem?What mistake did you make?
"Good questions from RawtalentAdditionally, Booking.com do not have the permission to simply reverse a reservation and authorise a refund. The hotel and specifically the conditions attached to a reservation, is enforced by the hotel."
"<<Same problem I booked Clayton Hotel Dublin Airport and made a mistake booking.com refused a refund. Worst company. I am never using them again. Absolute disgusting customer service.>>If you made a mistake and you had booked a room that was non refundable then the hotel are quite within their rights not to refund you. Booking.com can do nothing about it. The hotel make the rules, the hotel take your payment. If they choose to make a gesture of goodwill for your mistake then that's up to them but booking.com can't make them."
"We were planning for holiday so looked in Booking.com We spotted one which we decided to ""reserve""while still looking for others so if we could not find better one we would ""book"" the first one.Anyway we carried on looking for more option in other holiday websites but then received email for the reserved one mentioning we are booked for that hotel and if we cancel we will lose the whole cost meaning not refundable.Here I am making the point between ""reserve and booking"" Reserve means hold on until you make your mind to book so why was I confirmed to have booked?I can't understand this.Now I am trying to get my money back via booking.com but whether I will get it is a grey area.I contacted them and they said it is hotel's policy that if you book non refundable option you won't get your money back.Anyway they said they will contact the hotel and persuade them to refund full amount. Hopefully they will consider my request.If not I will end up with sleepless nights losing almost £1400"
You presumably typed in your payment information and selected a non-refundable room. Your understanding and definition of ‘reserve’ is clearly not the same as booking.com’s and the hotels.
"""Your understanding and definition of ‘reserve’ is clearly not the same as booking.com’s and the hotels""....and mine......When you make a reservation you reserve a room.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I've never seen a feature by which you can reserve a room, if by that you mean put a hold on it and confirm or book it later. Not on Booking.com or any other booking platform.It's up to the hotel now. I have no idea whether they will be sympathetic to the mistake you made in thinking that reserve means something other than book in the hotel industry."
"I would advise that I am an Octogenarian & not very good at all the technicalities of the Internet. When I entered the information about the vacation I pointed out that it was subject to the Apartment meeting certain requirements i.e. 1. Satellite T.V. with all the BBC1,BBC2,& ITV1 Channels ? 2. The apartment had a four ring cooker ? 3. Was there a lift as I am an Octogenarian & would be unable to carry a case or myself up a flight of stairs. I did not realise that by selecting the Enter button on my computer that this would automatically make it a Non Refundable Reservation. As I have stated I am an Old Age Pensioner with very little financial resources & cannot afford to pay Booking.Com £704.76 for a basic simple mistake on my behalf. I would therefore very much appreciate under these extenuating circumstances if you would waive the charge, particularly as I will not be traveling to La Palma in January 2019. Can anyone help me ? Kind Regards John"
"547.If as you say, you stated that the reservation would be acceptable on those terms only, then you need to contact the accommodation provider and ask them to cancel the reservation without penalty. If this fails then notify your card provider.Its very odd that you were not prompted a couple of times during the booking process informing you that you were about to make a non refundable reservation."
"Yes, John, please contact the accommodation directly, and see if they are willing to cancel your reservation wihtout penalty. I hope that they are, but at the end of the day, you made a mistake, so your chances will be highe rif you are polite, apologise, and explain that you messed up.If Booking.com has charged you, as I believe they do with some holiday rentals, I understand that the final decision will still rest with the accommodation owner."
"I've booked a room for 11 nights (500$) yesterday through Agoda.Unfortunately, after paying through credit card, i noticed the it is 1 month earlier (check-in day will be this September) while i want to order in October. That means i have a wrong click or something.I have contacted hotel first. They told me to contact Agoda. I did it, and Agoda told me wait for them to contact hotel again for me. After few minutes, Agoda said that is is no change and non refundable. Say sorry and can not help me.So unhappy, What should i do now?"
"This thread is about Booking.com. If you used Agoda, please post in an Agoda thread instead of this one. Thanks very much."

I work in a call center making reservations for a well known hotel chain I do not think nonrefundable reservations should be cancelled for anyone for any reason read your terms and conditions no one should be an exception to the rule.
"Amanda, I agree. If I book non-refundable then that’s a choice I have made. But people do want the cheaper price of a non-refundable booking but still seem to believe the word non-refundable does not apply to them."
"I'm fully aware of the choices I make and the potential consequences. When I book a non refundable room, I expect to lose the money if I have to cancel, regardless of whether I go through Booking,com, book directly or use some other site.I don't have any issue with people cancelling non refundable rooms. Nor do I object to them asking if any kind of refund would be possible as a gesture of goodwill. What I don't like so much is when they rant or comnplain about not getting their money refunded.I don't understand the sense of entitlement that some have."
Do you have the number for booking.com?
"Go to the booking.com website. At the bottom of the homepage, click the blue link [Customer Service Help]. On that page click the drop down link [Get In Touch]. You will find local and international phone numbers at the bottom."
We booked a hotel online recently in France. It took us over an hour to find it and the refundable period had expired. The property’ was so unbelievably dreadful we couldn’t stay there- The Joangi in St Jean Pied de Port by the way - have we any chance of getting our money back from Booking.com
">>>It took us over an hour to find it and the refundable period had expired<<<While it’s possible that the last hour of the cancellation expiry was exhausted, it’s also quite possible that by that date, the cancelled had already expired.Also it’s no consolation, but cancelling after you’ve checked-in is not applicable. Lastly, it’s not Booking.com that have your funds, it’s the hotel"
"Yes, I'd say you have zero chance of a refund from Booking.com if they didn't charge you for the stay. You'll have o ask the hotel, and I wouldn't have very high expectations of even getting a reply if they are as dreadful as you say.Edited: 2 years ago "
We didn’t check in at all. My husband went in - I refused to enter the property- and came out saying it was unsuitable.
"bit too late, but future problems i sold my holiday package on this site transfertravel.com last weekend. great people."
niamh g.....First post and you are recommending a travel site.
"Booked a hotel through Booking.com and chose the non-refundable option. Later couldn't make the trip and gave it up as a lost cause after speaking to hotel who said they couldn't do anything as it was a 3rd party booking. Did some research and found this thread. Spoke to Booking.com, agent was very pleasant and did a quick check to see if the hotel had given refunds in the past. She said she would ring hotel and ask for a refund and if not available go for a change of date. She rang me back 5 minutes later. Hotel had taken money from my card and wouldn't do a refund, they were happy to rebook to another date which they did. Under the circumstances I was really impresed with the way it was dealt with by the agent at Booking.com. Lesson learnt-pay a bit extra for flexible optionEdited: 2 years ago "
"I have just for the first time ever booked a non-refundable room for one night this September against my better judgment but places were booking up fast so I went into it rather hastily. I've always had the option to cancel eg up to 48 hours before or even less should I not be able to travel due to illness or unforeseen circumstances. I couldn't ask this question (except to leave a message in the requests box) without leaving the page. The hotel looks good, if pricy, but only had one night when I wanted two. So, if I found something better in the meantime, doesn't look as if I can cancel and not incur costs, does it? I always take out holiday insurance so if I couldn't travel for any other reason I should be able to get it refunded. But this isn't a way I like to operate, to be almost coerced into a non-refundable deal because there was no other option. I mean it wasn't as if it was a cheap deal - £135 for one night for two people is hardly a bargain and is a price I have rarely paid"
"Unfortunately, comparing what you’ve done in the past with flexible reservations is really an irrelevant factor here. Regardless of the reasons as to why you knowingly accepted the non refundable reservation and why you did or didn’t cover yourself with travel insurance, that is not the fault of Booking.com or the hotel.As for the claims you were ‘coerced’ into booking a non refundable room, is another discussion for another time."
Thanks for your advice. We had actually booked a hotel which we could have got our money back 24 hours before but by the time we found the ghastly property the time had expired!!Would you be so kind as to give me the phone number of the booking.com agent. I haven’t been able to locate it. Many thanks
"Julia, nobody here works for booking,com so wouldn’t have phone numbers for their “Agents”.There should be contact methods on their website."
"<<Would you be so kind as to give me the phone number of the booking.com agent. >>What booking.com agent? Your contract is with the hotel, and they set the cancellation policies. If you think you are due a refund then contact the hotel.."
"I'm trying to cancel a booking and have contacted the BnB directly. Their reply was ""Unfortunately not. Booking was made through booking.com"". This indicates to me that they would be ok with doing it but don't realise that they can. Have you any advice that I can pass on to them to help? Like, just don't charge the card and let booking.com know the room is free? I don't know what their interface is like but I have to assume they can cancel bookings.Edited: 2 years ago "
I just spotted an option to request that the owner waive fees for a cancellation. So hopefully that'll go through.
"Jason. I would take the hotels comment that the booking was made through BDc as a reference to it being non refundable, rather than they'd be happy to refund you......and No, the hotel does not have a magic button to cancel your booking, it has to be done via BDc."
And here's me hoping it would be a magic button. Thanks for clearing that up Rawtalent. Much appreciated.
If you had seen this hotel you’d know you woul have Buckley’s of get a refund. have a look at Joangi in Jean-pied de port. It’s a classic!!!
"I have a terrible experience with booking.com, anyone can help me? I made a reservation, few hours before check in. I made the payment with my credit card, the booking.com already confirmed the booking when i contacted the property suddenly the person told me he is no longer for the property again and asked me to cancel the booking. I try to called the booking.com number for Indonesia, but the line is full. I tried to email, along with the prove of chat conversation with the property but none booking.com can do about it. Truly dissapointed, and made me angry. Anyone can helped me? To contact representative office in Indonesia?"
578.Have you actually been charged for the reservation?
"Hmmm. In actual fact I got in touch with said hotel owner who was prepared to let me cancel (I didn't) because actually the accommodation in that resort is booking up in a way I've rarely seen for September. But that's rather the point. I can see why someone who may have difficulty rebooking accommodation having this sort of policy but as someone who's had over 50 years of staying in a variety of holiday accommodation it honestly doesn't give me the sort of flexibility and freedom that I as a customer am looking for. Plenty of establishments run a sensible policy of 48 hours notice to cancel and no charge if room is rebooked. That sort of flexibility keeps both parties happy. Needless to say, I for one am put off by no refundable polices in a place that can easily rebook 10 times over and judging by the length of this thread so are many others"
"Yes I did, I just received my E-Billing statement from the BanK the transaction is in there. I tried to ask my Bank to contact Booking.com. But they can not do about it, since there are no cancelation confirmation letter from Booking.com. It is truly sad and made me angry."
"I share your feelings but no-but no-one would ever want to stay at the Joangi so there is no way the room would be rebooked!,"
"581.You need to raise the issue with your bank, not booking.com."
">>>Plenty of establishments run a sensible policy of 48 hours notice to cancel and no charge if room is rebooked<<<Then you can just stick to those ‘plenty of establishments’ that offer what you want. Simple. Just don’t expect everyone to follow the same cancellation and refund conditions, as it’s absurdly unrealistic"
"** Just don’t expect everyone to follow the same cancellation and refund conditions, as it’s absurdly unrealistic **Absolute tosh. Many places operate that sort of policy - that's why I stay in them. Good luck to anyone who operates any other sort of policy, they won't be getting my custom and incidentally this is exactly what this thread is about."
"I booked the Penthouse Apartment in Zagreb. 08/18/2018I went there, they have no body home, nor reception.But the apartment door is opened, we walked and lived there 2 nights. Nobody came to to see us. I was on 4th fl. But upstairs on 5th floor all belonged to the Penthouse Apartment. I found the Booking.com charged me two nights because of “No Show”. On the check out day, we went out to buy food for next town, when we back, i found the apartment door lock had been changed, and all our luggage were inside, after an hour the house keeper came and told me “the host has been canceled on your booking. And he force us to pay 100€ for his lock change. He said, if we don’t pay for him, we will lost our luggage and will be charged for illegally annexed a private property. The booking.com will never know and never care your safety, all they want just to make their profit."

"586.Were you staying in the correct apartment? Should you have stayed in the apartment ""upstairs""?"
"Booking.com are a business, Chanter. Why should they care about your safety? That's your responsibility, and if you ask me, what you did in entering an apartment simply because it was accessible to you, wasn't the greatest decision in the world."
"**LOL, perhaps you can sell your pitch to all the other hotel owners and make your millions.**I don't need to! It's already being done. Why do you think the Premier Inn model is so successful? They do indeed operate such flexibility, you pay a bit more when booking your room for such flexibility which means you can cancel up to midday (or even later) on your day of arrival!! Premier Inns are expanding rapidly so they are clearly doing something right and know that today's traveller likes that flexibility. Not only that, they guarantee a peaceful night's sleep and if you don't get one you get your money back.Flexibility and a little goodwill go a long way if you care about your brand.If the place where I'm staying this September had a Premier Inn, that's exactly where I would have booked.Edited: 2 years ago "
585 & 591. Premier Inn also offer a non refundable rate. As do Travelodge and thousands of hotels worldwide.Edited: 2 years ago 
"They do, but my point is you can book either. Hence I usually go with Premier Inns if I can. ( I find them superior to Travelodges.) You pay a bit more for the refundable option but have the freedom to cancel up until the day you're booked in and the price for that flexibility isn't extortionate, it's reasonably priced. You will also find their non refundable charges cheaper than the refundable option (as well as cheaper than other comparable holiday accommodation)Edited: 2 years ago "

I have reservations a best west in olive branch Mississippi but my meeting got canceled for September 6 through the eighth what do I do
If your booking is non refundable there's nothing you can do apart from cancel the booking. You can ask the property if they would be willing to refund you but they are not obliged to.
What if have to cancel due to a Hurricane watch in the area we'r are visiting? Still non refundable?
601.Ask your travel insurers if they will cover the cancellation costs.
"<<What if have to cancel due to a Hurricane watch in the area we'r are visiting? Still non refundable?>>Yes, unless the hotel is willing to refund you. It is something that would be down to your insurance, even if it had been hit by a hurricane, but whether you'll be able to claim depends on what your policy covers."
"Have called every number I have for Booking.com and can not cancel my reservation. I understand I will have to pay $68.99, that's not the problem. Just trying to be a good citizen and cancel because with hurricane coming I know there are people who could use this room"
604.No need to phone booking.com You cancel your reservation online
"Whenever I;ve needed to cancel a reservation with Booking.com, it's been easy and straightforward to do it online. Deliberately so, because it's an online platform at the end of the day!"
I want to cancel my booking of Carlton Motel PEI for Sept 21 2018
607.You need to follow the instructions on your confirmation email from booking.com
Actually there is a 14 day cooling off in accordance to the uk online purchase law. See citizen advice website.
"No this is not true, online booking laws come into play"
"Steph A<<Actually there is a 14 day cooling off in accordance to the uk online purchase law. See citizen advice website.>>It is true. The 14 days cooling off peiod is not applicable to accommodation, as the citizens advice website clearly states. It didn't apply when the DSR were in force either."
609. 610Incorrect
"So having understood that a non-refundable means just that, and without playing devil's advocate, what happens when you book your room 2 weeks in advance, but the very next day try to amend the dates? The answer comes up that I would have to cancel my original booking, not be refunded for that, then re-book on the proper dates, and cough up yet more cash for the pleasure (or punishment, depending who's side you're on).Now if I were a hotelier I would be well annoyed with any last minute no-shows, but c'moooon, this is 2 weeks before!!"
"What is the relevance of the two weeks before?If it’s to imply that the hotel has a chance to resell the room, it’s a misinformed guess. It’s bad business practice.Guaranteed revenue versus possible revenue IF it resells? Hotels will take the guaranteed money each and every time."
"If I were a hotelier my business plan would be based on maximising revenue per room, probably on a square metre basis. One way of maximising revenue would be to offer some cheaper advance purchase rates in addition to having demand led pricing on more flexible terms. That's because I would be confident that some of those non refundable booking would be cancelled, and keeping the revenue as well as reselling the room wherever possible would be a net gain for me. It would also be a net gain for those who don't cancel or amend their bookings and therefore save money on my regular prices.Two weeks would be irrelevant to my business plan unless my plan was totally base don allowing free cancellations until that point, which would require a different strategy again. I'm not a hotelier so maybe I'd still get it wrong, but that's the way I look at it from the perspective of being a traveller."
"I did the same, got the hotel to waive cancellation fees but my question is what happens after? My booking list is still showing that booking and it's still saying to cancel will be the full amount. So once the hotel agrees, what is the next step? That's what no one seemed to have answered."

"Live and learn:Last week, I reserved on Booking.com a non-refundable room at Rome Central Inn for a few days in late December next.Three months out, mind you.It was supposed to cost $220 - but when I clicked on the ""reserve"" button, the total came up as $300! - because of a bunch of add-on charges in the fine print.I immediately cancelled the reservation because I was under the mistaken impression that there was a grace period for online purchases like this.But Rome Central Inn immediately charged me full price for the room.And it turns out the grace period is only for flights.So I contacted them, and asked them if I could at least stay in the room for which they had just charged me full price.Nope.They've got my money, I'm outta luck.So nasty, so greedy.."
"It doesn’t matter if you book 3 days out or 3 months out, non-refundable generally means no refund.What were the bunch of add-ons? Were they service fees, taxes, or city taxes? How were they described? They would have been totalled up and you would have seen a final price before you clicked to complete the booking, so I am unsure why you cancelled it afterwards. Why did you think that a non-refundable hotel booking would have a “grace period”? If you cancelled it, then it sounds like the hotel had that room available for others, and maybe someone else booked it after you decided to cancel.Doesn’t sound nasty and greedy. It sounds like all the hotel prices and Terms and Conditions of that booking were displayed, but maybe you didn’t understand about something being non-refundable and you cancelled it so won’t get a refund. Also sounds like you made unfortunate assumptions which were not based on fact.It’s always terrible when we lose money because of mistaken beliefs about Terms and Conditions. All we consumers can do is to read everything, double check our facts, shop around and compare prices and know that if we book something which is non-refundable then we need to be pretty sure it’s what we need and can use."
"vinteui1, just thinking about that comment you made about the “grace period for flights”. You may want to double check that too as for Americans I believe there is a 24 hour grace period or period when you can cancel, but only if you have booked the flight on the airlines own official website, not if you have booked it on a third-party booking site or some random online booking website. It has to be a booking with the airline directly.So don’t assume anything, please double check or you may lose more money."
"""It doesn’t matter if you book 3 days out or 3 months out, non-refundable generally means no refund.""It should matter. 3 days out means the hotel may miss the chance to sell the room to someone else. 3 months out? No way.""What were the bunch of add-ons? Were they service fees, taxes, or city taxes?""All of the above. ""They would have been totalled up and you would have seen a final price before you clicked to complete the booking...""Wrong. The final price only appeared after completing the booking.""maybe someone else booked it after you decided to cancel.""No. The same room at the same price has remained available ever since. It is still available today.Once I learned that there was no grace period, all I asked was for them to at least let me stay in the room that I had already paid for.They absolutely refused, and continue to refuse.That is what I think is nasty and greedy. I have paid in full for the room. It is still vacant. Why won't they let me stay there?"
"They won’t let you stay there in that room because you chose to cancel it. If you wanted to stay you should not have cancelled.No, sorry I don’t believe that it didn’t display a final price before you booked. Usually things show a base price, then all the fees and taxes and a total price. Then you click to book it.Edited: 1 year ago "
"""I believe there is a 24 hour grace period or period when you can cancel, but only if you have booked the flight on the airlines own official website, not if you have booked it on a third-party booking site or some random online booking website.

In connection with this same trip with six family members coming to Italy from all over the place, I had to reschedule a flight booked on Expedia for a couple of days earlier. No problem. Easy. The way things ought to be."
"There is the way you obviously think and hope things should be, and the actual Terms and Conditions imposed by booking sites. When we use booking sites and something says non-refundable you can’t just assume or hope or expect that won’t apply to you and you will have a grace period.Probably best for you to book direct with hotels in future and choose deals which offer a Free Cancellation period. Then if you change your mind you can cancel freely.Rome has city taxes payable directly to the property. Many cities do. Was that the city tax you saw. :- turismoroma.it/news/contributo-di-soggiorno…"
"""They won’t let you stay there in that room because you chose to cancel it. If you wanted to stay you should not have cancelled.""Jeezus, dude - look at yourself. Look at what you're defending. They've got my money - way more than I was expecting to pay.The room that I paid for hasn't been sold to anybody else.But they refuse to let me stay in the room that I have paid for.Is that fair? Is that just?I mean, seriously?""I don’t believe that it didn’t display a final price before you booked.""You weren't there. I was. You're wrong."
"You clearly want things to be how you want them, not within the Terms and Conditions and Policies of that hotel. Yep, sometimes hotels stick to Terms and Conditions we agree to when booking so we can’t cancel and then say oh, now I want that room I’ve just cancelled. Some hotels might be flexible, but others not.I’m not defending anything, just puzzled that you make assumptions, cancel things and are angry when the hotel says non-refundable means no refund and no getting the cancelled room back.I wish we all could just have hotels bend T and C to suit us, but life’s not like that. I tend to take hotels and booking sites at their word - if I see ‘non-refundable’ I darn well believe it. By the way, I’m not a Dude. Not sure what the female version of Dude is....maybe Dudette or Dudess.Edited: 1 year ago "
"""When we use booking sites and something says non-refundable you can’t just assume or hope or expect that won’t apply to you and you will have a grace period.""D'accordo. I accept that. It's wrong, and there ought to be consumer protection laws in effect that prevent this sort of abuse - but I accept it.What I can't accept is that I'm not allowed to stay in the empty room that I have paid for.That is greedy. That is nasty.Edited: 1 year ago "
"<<In connection with this same trip with six family members coming to Italy from all over the place, I had to reschedule a flight booked on Expedia for a couple of days earlier. >>That is Expedia's own policy. There is no automatic cooling off period for flights unless they were booked in the US direct with the airline. <<Wrong. The final price only appeared after completing the booking.>>The price displayed includes VAT and includes the Rome city tax. I agree with Avanti, I do not believe the price went up without it being displayed on screen first. You booked a non refundable room. You cancelled it and then you wanted to still stay in it. If the hotel said they wouldn't reinstate it the booking that's their prerogative."
"We consumers have a choice. You chose non-refundable. Those prices tend to be cheaper so that’s why many of us consumers book them. You could have booked something with free cancellation which may have been a bit more expensive, but would have given you flexibility. We can’t book the cheaper one with the rigid non-refundable Conditions and then expect the flexibility of the more expensive free cancellation option.I think there needs to be more Consumer Education about how to use booking sites, reading, understanding and accepting Terms and Conditions. Doesn’t matter if it’s for a hotel booking or buying a product or service."
"Chapter 2:I have now rebooked the same room at Rome Central Inn, at the same price.Will they really charge me twice for this room?"
"""If the hotel said they wouldn't reinstate it the booking that's their prerogative""Yeah - no kidding.But is that the *right* thing for them to do?"
"All I asked was to be allowed to stay in the room that I was forced to pay for, against my will."
"If you cancelled a non refundable room, then you rebooked the same place for the same dates later, absolutely they will charge you twice. Your funds for the initial booking has been processed through their system when the res was cancelled and it’s gone. It’s actually a messy practice reinstating a prepaid reservation, and reversing funds back into the reservation. It causes a chunk of issues with accounting and audit.This isn’t some moral discussion about right or wrong, it’s a business and industry practiceOn a side note, if you are infuriated by the decision of the hotel, I’m actually astounded that you’ve rebooked the same hotel againEdited: 1 year ago "
You must really love the look of that hotel to have paid for it twice.
"This has to be a wind up, who in their right mind books again the same hotel they have just cancelled!"

Maybe if you need to book any other stays in Italy then you could possibly consider Monastery or Convent stays instead of hotels. This website lists many in Rome and elsewhere around Italy:-https://www.monasterystays.com/https://www.monasterystays.com/…
"<<I want them to either (1) act like good Christians, or, (2) look me in the face and tell me that they have acted like good Christians.>>So you expect the rest of the world to act as you ""think"" a good Christian should act? In case you weren't aware, there are other religions, so why you think everyone should adhere to what you perceive are Christian values I have no idea. I do know though, that business decisions are not based on religion."
"Religion absolutely doe snot come into this. I;m afraid you made some unwise decisions. Instead of making assumptions (which turned out to be wrong) and looking into things,. you rushed to cancel a booking and then made yet another reservation despite being so unhappy. You will now pay far more thna th eprice you didn't like in the first place, and unless the hotel decides to change it's mind you have zero chance of not being charged for both bookings.I really hope you can learn from this, and the biggest lesson is that things are rarely as we'd like them to be."
I am facing same type of problem I also done NONREFUNDABLE ROOM through booking.comI have send them email and many times calls but they are refusing to REFUND MY MONEY because this is NON REFUNDABLE BOOKING HOTEL IN LATVIA RIVERSIDE HOTEL AND ST.OLAV HOTEL BOTH HOTEL ARE REFUSING MY PAYMENT.please reply if anybody have any solution.
We have booked a hotel in HongKong but one of my friend accidentally cancelled the transaction. Is it possible to retrieve or booking?
645.Do you understand what Non refundable means?
"646.If it was a refundable or pay in full at the property type booking, then just rebook. If it was a non refundable, then contact Booking.com customer service and see if they will liaise with the property to reinstate your reservation.Though in this instance the property is within their rights to say no."
">>>please reply if anybody have any solution.<<<There is no solution. You booked a non refundable rate. That means that in the event of you cancelling, you forfeit the money you've paid. You've asked them to make an exception and the answer was no. That's all you can do. End game."
I did call the hotel within the 24 hours...and they said to go to booking.com. HELP!!!
"Not sure what you mean by “within the 24 hours”? If you booked on booking,com and want to cancel then you can do that on booking,com. If it’s within a free cancellation period then you should get a refund. If it’s past the free cancellation period then you won’t get a refund, and if it was a non-refundable booking you won’t get a refund."
650.What is the problem?
I need my money back
"Linda C, who are you speaking to? Nobody here on this public Tripadvisor forum works for booking,com so can’t get your money back for you. If you booked a deal which was non-refundable then that means no refund if you choose to or need to cancel.What happened and are you entitled to get your money back?"
"Happy EndingRome Central Inn has let me go with a penalty of just €10.They thereby guaranteed themselves a friendly review.I mean, c'mon, people - this isn't all that hard. Just treat people as you would wish to be treated, and all is well."
">>>I mean, c'mon, people - this isn't all that hard. Just treat people as you would wish to be treated, and all is well<<<Very fortunate outcome.As much as I agree about treating people well, doing so is no guarantee that you’ll get a refund for a non refundable reservation"
"I agree in principle with treating people well. However, we can't expect honour and decency from everyone. My way of viewing things is that I expect to be bound by the terms and conditions of a contract. A gesture of goodwill is not an entitlement, but it's very welcome when it happens."
"This summer on the 8th of July 2018, we booked a non-refundable reservation through Booking.com a Family room for 4 adults and on the drop down menu for two children under the age of 2 years; in RHYL, at ROSEVIEW HOTEL, for 2 nights from the 24th of July 2018, and paid in full on a debit card in good faith. What we thought we paid for in it's entirety and according to the booking form and invoice was a family room which contains 2 interlinked rooms with a bathroom, one bedroom with a double bed the other with two single beds (can be made into a double bed) and a sofa, we also requested a cot for the infant.The afternoon before we were expected to arrive the next day to the Hotel, the Hotel proprietor phoned to say he had taken out the single beds from the second room and just left the sofa, he felt it was appropriate since the sofa bed also converted into a double bed, therefore we should be alright with it, he also mentioned that he had no cots available. We were shocked that he should have so drastically have changed the arrangements to the rooms and to have cashed in the money prior to consulting with us about the changes he had made, and on the fact that he couldn't deliver on the agreement. We voiced our concern that he had made it impossible for our family of 4 adults and a 4 weeks old infant and 19 month old toddler to be accommodated over night and how we felt it was, inappropriate that he should have taken the beds and not letting us know about not being able to supply a cot before the afternoon we were to arrive the next day. We felt he must have had a last minute booking where he needed the beds and the cot and decided to take them from the rooms we had booked 2 weeks prior to arriving, the proprietor agreed that was the case, that he left it to the last minute to give notice about not being able to supply a cot for either of the infants. I confirmed that I would find it uncomfortable to sleep on a sofa with my back at my age, be it my 70th year. The proprietor then suggested he would let us have an extra room he has available with a double bed for a reduced price of a £100 for over the 2 nights stay. We thought that was rather insulting to charge an extra £100 in compensation for taking the beds out of our room and the extra cost still didn't solve the problem of not being able to accommodate the children with not having a cot. We didn't have a travel cot to take or even had the time to make arrangements to rent or to buy a cot at such a last minute notice. Also we wouldn't have had room in the cars with having to take 2 pushchairs, one in each car for the benefit of the 1 infant and 1 toddler under the age of 2. Without a cot in the room we would have been unable to sleep the children and it would also would have been a health and safety risk, as well as most uncomfortable to have a 4 week old and a 19 month old child and 2 adults in 1 double bed. We refused the offer of the extra room and requested our money back.By this time I've totally lost my trust in the proprioter being trustworthy and we sent a text to confirm what was said on the phone, and requested our money back.However, the proprietor not just cashed in the original costs for the family room he also added the extra £100 for the room he offered and we didn't want. Worst of it all is that the bank has paid all this out to him regardless of our complaint."
"taylona2018,That seems to be more of a complaint about that specific hotel rather than any issues with Booking.com. Are you going to write a Review on Tripadvisor on that hotels reviews page, as that’s where it belongs. I just clicked the magnifying glass icon at the top right side of this page and searched for Roseview hotel, Rhyl. I found a Roseview B & B. Open the link below and if this is the place, scroll,down a bit on its page and click the green coloured Write a Review button and type your comments about the hotel:-https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-…"
"taylona that is a review and forums are not the place for reviews. It has absolutely nothing to do with how to cancel a non refundable reservation on booking.com, which is what this thread is about."

"Maylin,That option to pay later at the hotel doesn’t mean you are just placing a temporary hold on the dates and can change your mind later. It means you have booked it and pay when you stay. Google maps doesn’t sell hotel rooms, so which hotel booking company have you now booked with? Do you mean you searched for hotels on maps and clicked on one of them and were taken off to some hotel booking website and booked a stay?Edited: 1 year ago "
"I don't like apps and I don't use them for booking stuff. I'm not clear whether you feel the app was misleading and, if so, how. It looks to me as if you made an assumption about how it all worked and this assumption turned out to be incorrect.Avanti is correct that a pay later reservation can still tie you into a non refundable booking. If you do that, all you can really do is to hope that the hotel will offer a gesture of goodwill. If you ask and the answer is 'no' then I'm afraid that's the end of it, unless you can get someone in higher management to change the decision.I also have to add that Google Maps does not produce reliable hotel prices. When I click on a random London hotel, it displays a number of different rates from different booking sites, but the prices for the dates I want to stay could potentially be very different."
I did what the OP did in so much as clicked on the wrong one and booked a non-refundable.Rang booking.com. They rang the hotel. The hotel were the good guys and changed it to the free cancellation version. At the non-refundable price.A big thumbs up to Best Western Plus Gen X Inn in Memphis.
">>>Rang booking.com. They rang the hotel. The hotel were the good guys and changed it to the free cancellation version. At the non-refundable price<<<A big thumbs up to the hotel indeed.But keep in mind, they are also the bad guys when they say no. It’s the hotels policy, it’s the hotels discretion.Booking.com has zero say in the matterEdited: 1 year ago "
"Yes, it has absolutely nothing to do with Booking.com. I wish more people would understand that Booking.com can only be a communication conduit between the guest and the accommodation. They don't set the policies and they don't decide whether to enforce those policies or not."
"Well...Booking.com is technically the travel agent and does ""contribute"" by often highlighting free cancellation and no prepayment meeting but then intermixing with room choices that are non-refundable. When tired & distracted ""mistakes"" can happen even to experienced users like me. I'm currently awaiting the hotels final position re my $900 ""mistake"" but am now optimistic. This forum was very helpful. Sourcing out the phone number and calling the local Booking.com office is best route--DO NOT use the website customer service portal...they give standard ""can't help"" responses. It is the hotel which your money and ultimately makes the decision but booking.com can assist and is doing so now in my case. A credit card dispute as others mentioned has to be initiated prior to paying the charges and a requirement is that first you must explore an amicable resolution. So yes, you must act quickly on this...my booking was Oct 24 evening, cancelled Oct 25 evening and potential golf trip for my group wasn't until June 2019. Hotel decision maker is back on Monday morning and based on discussions this morning I expect a positive response. Like J. M from Melbourne I will identify hotel and give it a ""thumbs up"" along with Booking.com if I'm successful. keep up the posts...they are educational and will help others."
"I realise it's the hotel's call. i call the local office. Both Booking.com people were polite and helpful. And they pointed out it was up to the hotel. Same as if I had a local travel agent book it.Good luck Ron M. I think being many months away from the date is a big positive. if it were a week or two, I would have got a ""no"", I reckon.Thinking about since then, other options could include locking the credit card (It seems my bank lets my ggo online and lock it as if it's lost or stolen, without cancelling it) or cancelling the credit card but if you have integrity and morals, that's not so easy to do."
">>>but booking.com can assist and is doing so now in my case<<<The missing word here is ‘try’.Booking.com can *try* and assist. Unfortunately, no matter how hard they push, it still comes back entirely to the discretion of the hotel. The reason I stress the word ‘try’, is that Booking.com literally has zero leverage to push for the cancellation. Not only zero leverage, zero benefits to gain. Hotels base their decision not only on their policy, but their likelihood to sell out. I’ll emphasise that again - their ability to sell out, not to resell just that room. And the logic is this. Guaranteed money locked in now, versus possibility of selling it later for the same overall dates and rates. How far out isn’t a primary factor (six months out is no guarantee it will sell)Edited: 1 year ago "
"I think a key distinguishing factor re these situations is whether there was an honest mistake discovered very quickly by the customer or not. If this is the case and the booking is far in advance why would any hotel owner/manager with integrity want to take an ""undeserved money grab"" for a product that will not be delivered? That is unconsiable in my view! That is also why our jurisdiction has a 10-day ""cooling off"" period for high-pressure contract sales such as time shares/water filtration systems etc as part of our Consumer Protection Act. A case where you knowingly booked non-refundable and the hotel has reserved that room for significant time based on that agreement and, you find out nearer the date that your can't go, is notably different. In my case the guys in my group have all ""stepped forward"" and said they'd still go if the hotel refuses my refund request. But I think everyone, including the hotel, will agree that is best that we go when we really want to and when one key guy who couldn't make the dates in question is available. To me, a hotel keeping money due to a quickly discovered error would be short-sighted and motivated purely by greed! I personally would fight that tooth and nail and would make a lot of noise doing so. I don't like to be ripped off, even while recognizing that an error of mine contributed to my predicament. Fortunately, the hotel I'm dealing with is a popular well-established destination hotel and part of a well-known brand which I've used frequently for many years. Consequently, I'm relatively confident it will make what I view as the 'right decision"". By treating me fairly I remain a loyal and supportive customer to both booking.com and the hotel chain. I make over 90% of my hotel bookings through booking.com because they consistently offer the best value to me. I completed a survey after having spoken to customer service yesterday and gave the rep who took my call kudo's and well-deserved compliments. But I also made the comment that the response(s), or lack of, from their customer service portal ""suck""!! Again, I recognize and thank this forum for pointing me in the right direction..."
"What you wrote is a fair comment, and comes across as common sense.Unfortunately, what consumers believe is common sense, doesn’t align with business strategies of all hotels. Their business like all others, is to ensure revenue. Yes, there will always be genuine mistakes. But there are also others who are not genuine. As previously mentioned, elapsed time - whether it’s long or short - is no indicator of whether a mistake has been made or not. One look through the forums at complaint threads will indicate how many complain about ‘a few minutes later I found a better hotel/rate’. A hotel cannot start allowing elapsed time frames as an indicator. What happens when it’s a same day reservation? What say if it was up to three months flexibility and the guest wants to cancel it two months and three weeks out? What say if it’s six months flexibility and the guest wants to cancel five months and three weeks into it? Guests will always complain. It simply opens a can of worms. Which is why the majority make it a blanket non refundable rate policy. A hotel also cannot take into account whether a key travel member can or cannot make the trip. The hotels business is to protect revenue for a perishable product. Which is why travel insurance exists. There also is a reason why non refundable rate exists. It’s a trade off of lower rates for no flexibility. That’s what consumers want. And keep in mind that consumers on the whole are doing no favours for the hotel, consumers are fickle and loyalty is actually not a high percentage. If the hotel decides they want to use their discretion to allow a cancellation and refund if a non refundable reservation, that’s entirely their discretion - and it’s an exception to the rule, not the norm. All of this again - as acknowledged - has nothing to do with Booking.com. Always the decision of the hotelA genuine question - if the hotel is one which you have frequented over many years, why did you not book direct or through their loyalty program?Edited: 1 year ago "
"Fair question. I've never traveled or used one hotel chain to the extent of earning meaningful rewards so my preference out of convenience and pricing evolved over the last decade to more exclusive use of one agency on which I can group my bookings and take advantage of its loyalty program--that having been Booking.com for the past 5+ years. The hotel chain is Choice, Comfort Inns etc. Ironically I have their airport hotel in Phoenix, Az knowingly booked at a non-refundable price because the flight i booked is also non-refundable and yes I do have cancellation coverage but only for sickness/death in family etc.. I also booked a property in Sedona for 3 nights through Booking.com but made sure that had cancellation rights as my trip also involves a visit with friends in Tuscon; and I want to maintain a bit of flexibility in case something comes up at their end. I tend to be more of a ""value"" traveler and the Comfort Inns/Choice are most frequently my choice when traveling in the US for airport/off the highway type stops. But for no particular reasons other than competition & conveniences I tend to use them less in Canada and often stay at Best Westerns or Travelodge locations."
"BTW Destination Expert you obviously are well-versed with the hotel perspective and I do understand your comments re upholding the non-refundable policy for reasons you stated. I have made an error once before on a trip to Whistler, BC to see my son and asked the property to reconsider because i had not noticed that the indoor swimming pool was under construction during the period of my stay. The hotel response was that their pricing reflected that fact; so it stood by its policy and i understood and accepted that. As it turned out, I was otherwise very pleased with the location and property and enjoyed my stay. My current situation is different as it was a genuine mistake meant to be only a place-holder pending a travel decision. Nothing to do with pricing, alternatives. So I can accept and understand the hotels considering on an exception basis. That is where booking.com can assist in vouching that I have no prior history of these type of requests or of being ""a problem"" per se. I did book that prior property through booking.com but dealt directly with the property and accepted its decision."
"I don't tend to think of Booking.com as a travel agent. I think of them as a booking portal or platform. That probably has a very big influence on why I don't expect them to do much by way of helping me if I have an issue.I always contact the hotel directly if I want them to do me a favour as in the case of cancelling a non refundable rate as the result of a mistake. Yes, it has happened to me a couple of times, and I found that being polite and apologetic went a long way to getting a good result. Even so, I have once or twice received a negative answer and I've had to accept that.It's just my opinion, but I believe that a personal approach is always likely to be more effective than going through a third party, even one I consider trustworthy for hotel bookings like Booking.com. While I think that your point about Booking.com being bale to vouch for your previous 'good behaviour' as it were, I'm not at all sure that it will have any kind of impact with the hotel. Not as much as me speaking to them myself, anyway."
"I agree with the personal approach part but that only works if you get a hotel manager with integrity and a sense of fairness. I did not. Mr .Khan of the Clarion Inn, Fredericksburg, VA never even returned my calls, nor did he even have the professional courtesy to communicate an official response to my refund request. I think it is profoundly ""wrong"" and ""immoral"" for someone in the Hospitality Industry to think they are entitled to someone's hard-earned money over a ""genuine error"", especially when it did NOT impact on their room inventory/availability. This is a pure money grab in exchange for nothing!! It is, to me, unconscionable and now unfortunately, I must go the Credit Card Dispute route. I have sent a letter to Choice Hotels customer service making them aware of this situation and asking it to be escalated to the Regional Management level but I'm not sure if the correspondence will ever be escalated or if anything can be done. But I won't surrender my money or my principles/conviction in ""what is right"" without a spirited fight! If I come across any ""tips"" of ""good information"" for others while waging this battle, I'll share. In the meantime i'm out $900 (they took the entire cost of 2 rooms booked for 4 days) due to a mistake making a reservation while tired and distracted--so be carefuly folks! These hotels are very, very quick to take your money and once they have it, they do not want to give it back! :-("
">>> I think it is profoundly ""wrong"" and ""immoral"" for someone in the Hospitality Industry to think they are entitled to someone's hard-earned money over a ""genuine error""<<<In the purest sense, I agree. The difficulty and the grey area is how the hotel is supposed to determine what is a mistake and what is not. It has to be understood that hotels have to literally deal with thousands of these type of requests and agreeing to all of them effectively makes non refundable conditions pointless. And this isn’t exclusive to just the hotel industry, airlines and in some similar aspects is retail. >>>especially when it did NOT impact on their room inventory/availability<<<8mths out, I agree, it would have no impact on their inventory or occupancy. But again, it comes back to how they want to adhere to their conditions. Just to clarify, was your wanting to cancel based on booking the wrong dates or based on one person not being able to travel on those dates?Edit - why was Ron’s last post reported? I didn’t find it inappropriate at allEdited: 1 year ago "
"Destination Expert, I mistakenly thought I was just holding a reservation with cancellation rights and forwarded to my group for discussion and a decision; and, cancelled the reservation when the trip wasn't going to work for a couple of the guys, again without appreciating the terms & conditions as I had never read them, I was working on the assumption of ""free cancellation, no payment required"" which was flagged at the hotel entry by Booking.com. Booking.com, to its credit, has continued to follow up but is being told the manager is not available? He had staff requesting authority to assist and simply didn't want to grant that and has chosen not to respond. To me there's no meeting of the minds here and no valid commercial transaction as they have my money and with the cancellation proceed, i have received absolutely no consideration in exchange. I did not want a $900 crash course in Credit Card disputes but based on the non-response by the hotel manager, I'm left with no other choice. As to why my last post was removed, good question! I suspect it's because I named the manager and hotel? In any event, I won't give any blow by blow details but I will share any interesting information or tips I gather through the Credit Card Dispute process. I'd much prefer just getting my hard-earned $'s back so everyone could ""move on""..."
"I see.Is there any possibility that your trip could potentially be rescheduled for another date? Or is there no chance you’ll be heading to that destination in the foreseeable future?Although not easy even 8mths out, I’m trying to think of some sort of middle ground where an amicable solution could be negotiated with the hotel. Yes, names may have been the trigger for removal, something I hadn’t considered."
"We have an annual Boys Weekend that same time period every year so with 2019 ruled out, the long term plans are to make this trip work for 2020. It is a 9 hour drive each way so our preference is have ""an extra day or two"" for this trip to make it worthwhile and also to get even a bigger group together so 6-8 maybe more. Given our core group of 5-6...I had just reserved for 4. Trouble is, I don't even have a reservation any more as I cancelled before appreciating the consequences; and, the hotel manager hasn't responded to either me or Booking.com. Theoretically, if offered, I'd likely accept my money being allocated to the matching 2020 dates as I'd be able to make that work. I'd rather not waste negative energy and suffer stress over the credit card dispute. But that was never offered...manager seems to be content to have my money in exchange for no consideration..."
"So, apparently with my credit card company, the merchant hotel has to be given 15 days to respond to and resolve the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by then, the charges are removed from my account, in terms of needing to pay, pending the outcome of the dispute. In the spirit of ""being reasonable"" and in accordance with the suggestion by Destination Expert, I have offered as an alternative, to accept at the same price the fully paid reservations for the matching dates in 2020. Better to invest in a future vacation trip than to expend negative energy towards a drawn-out, time consuming dispute, the outcome of could realistically go either way! I have no experience in respect to credit card disputes so i possess no knowledge or confidence re the process. Booking.com continues to follow up and advocate on my behalf so I am pleased with that. I have confirmed the advice of my credit card company and my alternative proposal to both parties. We'll see how that plays out.."
"The credit card dispute process in your case isn’t particularly favourable, as they have their stated policy. However it’s not an entirely lost cause because within the two weeks, the correct documentation has to be sent by the merchant to the CC company - and many get it wrong. In regards to the process of mutual agreement with the hotel, it is easy enough - IF - the hotel management want to be amicable. To reinstate the reservation in their system and change dates, only takes seconds. The credit still sits on your reservation (active or not) until the date of the reservation, when it gets absorbed (reconciled). You mentioned ‘annual’ boys gathering - is it the same destination each year? If so, that would be my pitch.And don’t let them tell you they can’t book it for 2020, as the hotel system will allow it,Edited: 1 year ago "
"Thanks for the info and advice--same weekend...destination differs and usually we go somewhere 2-3 hours from our core group, in Ontario, Canada and we only take the Monday off work (those that aren't retired! lol as we have a couple of those!). The problem in 2019 is that we those still working will have to take 3 vacation days to make the longer trip (9 hours pure driving each way) worthwhile as we lose most of a day on each end. The couple of guys with that problem in 2019 will plan for this in 2020 and good possibility that we get 6-8 guys to go and need a couple of more rooms closer to the date. Booking.com does continue to ""assist""...which is good as I feel I need a buffer between me and him! lol ... if he delegates to his marketing manager to rebook for 2019 we will be resolved as I have no issues with her...she ""wanted"" to help..."
"I booked accommodation through Booking.com yesterday, and paid with a non-refundable cancellation. This particular location stated that keys were to be picked up from an address approximately 1.3km from the property. I checked it out on the map and was okay with that. I am travelling with family and we will all be hauling our suitcases, but it was apparently flat. and that's not too far if we take our time and pass the shops. However, immediately after paying, I received an email confirming the booking, still stating the same address for picking up the keys. Then I received another email from the property giving a completely different address for picking up keys, which was over 3km away from the property. I asked them which address was right, as we would be travelling on foot, with children and luggage and this was not something I was happy about. I would not have booked if that term had been written into the booking page. I sent them about three emails before receiving a short reply stating that the old address was gone, and we had to go to the new one. They said they would give us a taxi from there, but now I'm really unhappy, as we have to get to the first address, then get a taxi to the property, and presumably we have to do the same thing in reverse when we're checking out. I said I really wasn't happy with that and would prefer to cancel, but they declined my request. The booking is over six months away, and the full amount as a cancellation fee is actually an unfair term in law. My contract is actually with Booking.com - whether they believe it or not - that's who I booked with. I have reached out to them about asking the property to cancel and waive the cancellation fee - or at worst charge me the commission fee that they have to pay booking.com. I don't have high hopes in a positive response, but I'm really unhappy about this. I would not have booked the property if the address for key pickup was listed as the one that is over 3km away. This is an important term of the agreement. I am considering approaching my bank about a chargeback but it's over $3000AUD - which is why I'm so angry about this amount. That is an unreasonable amount to retain as a cancellation within 24 hours of booking for something that is well over 6 months away. Really not happy about this - and unlikely to ever use booking.com if they're going to be no help at all in such a matter."
"Sara...By what mode of transportation are you and the family arriving at ""the property""? Trying to understand why your only alternative is to ""walk"" the 1.3 km or 3 km and why a solution such as cabbing or delivering the keys to you at the property could not be negotiated rather than canceling the whole trip? Your ""issues"" are between you and the property owner--although Booking.com can advocate/assist you with resolving ""your issue"". To have any chance of success with a Credit Card dispute, you have to prove and document that the was no legitimate ""mutual understanding"" of the contract and therefore no agreement so the contact should be considered void; plus, you have to document an attempt to resolve the issue(s) with the property owner. What factor(s) prevent a more simple amicable solution to the key pickup issue? Re assistance from Booking.com be sure to call your local office...do not bother contacting customer service through the website! But perhaps consider and propose ""a reasonable solution"" they can assist you with? For those following/interested in my situation, I received a call late yesterday afternoon (Friday) from the property marketing manager/rep. She sounded genuinely happy to be able to advise me that she will be processing a full refund to me on Monday. I'm very pleased and relieved!!"
"Great outcome Ron, very happy for your resolution with the property.Sara,Your contact is actually with the property, it’s clearly stated on the T&C’s. “By using or utilizing the Trip Service (e.g. by making a Trip Reservation through the Trip Service), you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the Trip Provider with which you make a reservation or purchase a product or service (as applicable)”That said, a change of property location - which you have in writing - should be more than sufficient to put through a CC dispute. It’s unfortunate because the market is currently flooded with private apartment owners posing as a commercial operation, many of whom are unscrupulous. My advice is to never book non commercial apartment hotels - ie. private rentals through non specialised websites. The likes of Booking.com, Hotels.com, Expedia and so forth are designed for commercial hotels onlyEdited: 1 year ago "
"Thanks KVE--I think by initiating the CC chargeback dispute and escalating through Choice, I was enough of a ""pain' to persuade the manager ""let go"" of the T & C's and ""get rid of me""! :-) lol Sarah, per KVE's advice & mine, if CC disputes in Australia works similar to Canada (and I believe they do), the CC company does ask you to document all attempts to resolve your Issue(s) directly with the merchant, in this case the property owner, and they give the merchant 15 days to respond/resolve the dispute before moving forward. Hence my advice to propose what you consider to be a reasonable solution (delivery of keys to you at the property for your arrival even if hidden in secret spot?) to your issue. My dispute coincidentally was resolved the day after I initiated the CC dispute."
"I will be coordinating myself and my family from a cruise in Southampton to get to the accommodation. We can get to the key pickup location and then we would then need to travel onwards to the property location.Trying to navigate from the changed key location to the property location is the problem. We’re visitors, I don’t know how we’ll get there, it’s too far to walk with children and luggage.Under Australian law, if an important term was omitted and it is one that would have stopped you purchasing had you been aware of it, that is grounds for cancellation of a contract. Also under Australian law, our contract is with booking.com, not the property. They represented themselves as booking agents and our agreement is with them. However, under Amsterdam, UK and Australian law, unfair contract terms are not enforceable.The 100% cancellation fee is an unfair term that places the consumer at a significant power disadvantage. It is also an unreasonable amount to withhold for cancellation as it is excessive and does not reflect their financial loss.I would accept a loss of an amount no more than 10%, however this entire situation is extremely unethical.I simply would not have booked the accommodation if I had known the key pickup was that far from the property. That alone, and given it was within moments of booking that I initiated contact, should be sufficient to cancel the booking without penalty."
">>>However, under Amsterdam, UK and Australian law, unfair contract terms are not enforceable<<<It’s entirely your prerogative, but I strongly suggest you don’t go down that path at the first instance. It will cost you more money and significant amount of grief. In over 30 years in the industry, I’ve never seen anybody in Australia win a legal case against an accommodation provider about the cancellation fee - if you had booked a non refundable rate.This is why I suggested you first go through your CC provider, to see if the dispute based on providing you with a different product is sufficient for them to suspend merchant fund transfer. You’re aiming at the provider not being able to supply the advertised product. Also by going through your CC provider, they have considerably higher leverage than yourself.But again it’s entirely your prerogative.Ron,I’ve worked for Choice many years ago and I know the system well. Each region have their Field Managers, responsible for the franchisee’s performance in their designated area. If any particular property gets any serious complaint and their ratings go down, it’s affects the Field Managers KPI’s. They have a fairly well structured penalty system, ranging from not being nominated for awards - and subsequently removed from co-op marketing (which affects their exposure and eventually marketing costs) all the way to the most serious penalty, which is removal from the franchise program. And they genuinely don’t hold back if franchises perform poorly. In addition, they also have performance clauses that enable them to negotiate franchise fee percentages. So the incentive is certainly there for the propertiesEdited: 1 year ago "
"I agree, but it seems so stupid. I would rather simply cancel the booking than chargeback through my credit card. I feel as though that is a far more harsh action that is hostile towards them, than simply asking for my rights to be respected and cancel the booking with no fee (or as I've also stated, a reasonable and not excessive fee).I will contact my bank tomorrow if I have not heard from the agent or the property - as I am still holding out hope that they will recognise that there is a much simpler solution to getting me off their backs."
"I 100% agree with your sentiments and the sooner these unscrupulous private owners get banned off the sites the better. It’s almost an impossible task, as the market is flooded with them, but some sort of regulatory body is seriously needed to protect both proper businesses and agentsThe system - if you’re intersted - is that major OTA’s need business registration, merchant banking details and location. The problem is that with savvy operators have caught onto getting around the process by registering private apartments with commercial names, paying for merchant terminals and they start.Edited: 1 year ago "
"What is extremely annoying is that people on here are stating that the site has nothing to do with the consumer, but our law in Australia suggests that a third party booking site is acting as an agent, and is the party that the customer deals with in the event of any problems. Neither party accepts responsibility for providing good customer service. The fact is that the cancellation fee is an unfair term that is not legal across all three different countries. But where to from here? I do know that I am now going to absolutely avoid booking through any third party site as a result of this, and go straight to the properties themselves. I appreciate that people are trying to provide a service, but I don't appreciate that they are absolving themselves of behaving fairly and reasonably towards the people they are dealing with."
"Again I understand your sentiments, but think of it like this. Whilst not identical, major OTA’s act as an advertising platform and for transfer of data - thats all, nothing else. It would be similar to that of a local newspaper advertising a product. The content of which, and the management of the product is the responsibility of the advertiser, not the advertising platform.In regards to reform and changes, it has to be industry wide. If this gives you some sort of idea, the UK Advertising Standards people have taken Booking.com to court - from what I recall - four times, and have come away successful just once. Even then it was effectively a slap on the wrist with changes to some wording and little else.Edited: 1 year ago "
"KVE, i looked at Booking.com's legal structure when I was exploring my options and it appears they are organized so that legal actions can only be brought against it in The Netherlands, they claim to have no legal assets or reps in any of the global jurisdictions in which they book. So yes, a difficult target; making the CC chargeback dispute a much preferred and less costly option. Interesting info re Choice..and yes leveraging ""reputational risk"" can be a very helpful card to play in these situations but alas, is not available to Sarah vs. this private owner. Sarah, I too agree with most of your sentiments but again point out that--from the perspective of the Credit Card Company--the dispute will focus on the condition at the heart of the dispute: in your case, the key-pickup location. They will ask you to document attempts at resolving ""that issue"" directly with the property owner (do you have a phone number and have you tried to discuss directly with them?) and will consider if you have suggested a reasonable alternative to a complete cancellaton, ie. such as delivery of the keys to you at a location convenient to the first pickup location that you had agreed to. If you offer a reasonable solution and the property doesn't respond or doesn't agree...then you've strengthened your case with the Credit Card chargeback, with which, btw, you should initiate a.s.a.p.. When I offered ""my alternative"", at the same time that I confirmed that a credit card dispute had been officially initiated, the property suddenly reversed it's position and granted me a complete refund. Sometimes you get lucky, and, I'm relieved to get out without excessive time, effort & stress exerted! I think how you position your arguments can be critical to your success. Good luck!"
"A lot of people believe that they have a contract with a booking site when in fact it is with the property, not the third party. Booking.com is no exception, as it has been made clear in their T&C's every time I've used them that the contract I'm entering into is with the property.I'm no expert on the law, especially the laws that apply in other countries, but I know that UK courts can find T&C's unreasonable when passing judgement on contractual disputes. If it's the same in Australia, then perhaps there has already been such a ruling on Booking.com, if anyone has managed to take action against them there. That might mean that a consumer down under is considered to have a contract with Booking.com, and prove a point to those of us who state otherwise."
I just wants to cancel my reservation please
"Herby, this is a public travel forum onTripadvisor it has no connection to booking.com. If you wish to cancel something then look in the booking,com website and do it there. Or maybe they sent you an emailed confirmation which has details of how to cancel. If it was a non-refundable Booking then if you cancel it you will not get any refund or money back."
You are so lucky. I have the same problem with Agoda at the moment and it's been a week and they have not been able to resolve the issue. I was already charged for the stay and will not be reversed until there is a final solution.
"Hi, I booked a week at a hotel in America somewhere with booking.com and realised my boyfriend had also booked somewhere for the same dates. So I called booking.com and explained I had literally just booked the hotel but needed to cancel and If I could get a refund (even though it should have been non-refundable). They took my details and got in touch with the hotel who kindly refunded me £1500 or there abouts. On the other hand I made a last minute booking mistake for a £90 room with a hotel in Britain, and afyer explaining to them my mistake, they offered no help what's so eve I think it depends on the kindness and customer service of hotel, and how they are willing to make money. I've worked in hospitality and I am.not convinced this is needed, especially when enough time is given to fill the room again. It almost feels like stealing."
"skiff, it's always the hotel's decision as to whether to offer a gesture of goodwill, and you're right that some will not be as accommodating as they could be. I've been lucky more often than not when I've made a mistake, but those who have said no to a refund have been within their rights to do so."
"I understand the sentiments, but unfortunately it’s a perishable item, and the statement about whether it’s enough time to resell the room is not a sufficient argument.The reason is purely based on the fact that there is no guarantee that it *will* resell. So the age old question remains - if it doesn’t sell, would you guarantee payment?It’s unlikely. It’s kind of like ordering a birthday cake, deciding you don’t want/need it, and arguing it can be resold before it goes off and asking for your money back. No bakery would agree to that.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I quite agree about rooms being perishable, and maybe it's worth mentioning that I've had success when I have literally only just made a booking and realised I'd made a mistake. I wouldn't even ask, in all honestly, if it had been more than a day or two since the booking was made."
"They made a big song and dance about the fact that the room was not usually available, so 8 or 9 months out of the actual date, I think they are making a point that it is easy for them to sell it onto someone else. They can't really use that excuse. I immediately asked them to clarify why the information was different and said that I'd rather cancel. Same day, no response until several days later when they declined.I have put through the chargeback request, just waiting to see what happens.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I think that what happened to you was not good at all, Sarah, but it is down to the apartment owners or managers. Sadly, this is not unusual when it comes to these types of bookings, and in my non expert view, as Booking.com operates under Dutch law, Australian consumer law isn't relevant.I don't dispute that they are likely to be able to rent the place out again, and I agree with KVE that your charge back request will be successful."
"But i have confirmed that Dutch law is the same as Australian law when it comes to unfair contract terms, so that’s on my side too."
"Good Luck with the charge-back Sarah and unfortunate that they are making you go that route under your circumstances as described. I too feel that you will be, and should be, successful. In my case, I finally received ""a position response"" after I both initiated the charge-back and escalated a complaint up the associated hotel branch consumer relations department. Not sure which had the real impact but the hotel manager, who never did speak to me, instructed his marketing manager to process my credits but to do it over two weeks, one room at a time. The final one came through last Thursday and the good news is that I got every penny back, even the foreign exchange processing charges which was a pleasant surprise! I even profited by a few pennies due to more favorable exchange rates! :-) lol ...eventually the greedy hotel and apartment operators will prompt Countries to place these type of transactions under ""Cooling off period"" Consumer Protection Legislation. My jurisdiction in Ontario, Canada has a 10-day period for door to door sales, Time Share sales and similar high-pressure sales items. Non-Refundable travel bookings should fall under the same legislation, in my honest opinion, with perhaps conditions/qualifications re a shorter cooling off period, say 48 hours, for bookings within 60 days of |""the event"". Until that happens I encourage newbies to read through some of the advice on this forum as most of it is ""on point"" and I found it very helpful. Thanks everyone and good luck to those who find themselves in this same predicament!"
It is up to the motel is you can cancel with no charge or not. It's nothing to do with booking.com. So you should be thanking the motel.
I booked twice on the same hotel I want to cancel 1 booking
"Cruiser, have you contacted booking,com about it? Nobody here can help you cancel anything as this is just a Tripadvisor forum and people chatting about their experience of using booking.com"
"Actually Cruiser, it is the hotel that you should be contacting first. If this is a simple ""duplicate booking"" issue, and you are still maintaining the initial booking, I do not see this as being a problem...but act fast and speak to the Hotel manager or customer servie manager! Make Booking.com aware of it (best to phone your local office), as it can also support you! This forum focuses more on the more complex and challenging issues surround ""how to cancel a non-refundable reservation""... and to me whether it be booking.com or some other booking platform, it doesn't matter...issues are the same."
Absolutely agree with Ron’s suggestionA duplicate reservation should be something that you could resolve with the hotel without intervention from Booking.com

"I have very bad experience. Booked a room for 7 for skiing in Italy w breakfast for 700 eur.(Hotel Aquila) Unfortunatelly I recognised that the opening of the ski slots are not fixed but changing based on snow conditions. Its Cortina Dampezzo so snow was there but opening day was postponed. OnceI recognised this I tried to cancel the reservation or reschedule. Used booking.com feature but request was refused. Then called the hotel but they werenot open to any discussion nor to cancel or give back even 10% or something or reschedule it eith additional payment.I informed the hotel that i will arrival later as no snow so so limited activity to do. They messaging me frequently that that there is no snow do not come and cancel my reservation to be able to use the room and breakfast i fully paid in advance for 4 days.Finally they cancelled my reservation so iwas even not able to give a feedback on the hotel.However there is a cancellation policy i think this is a disguisting business practice to get your money for nothing (w breakfas) and even sell your room you fully paid if you do not arrive on the day. Worst thik you even cannot share this experience on booking.com as you “were not there”. And booking.com do not support you at all, they also get his share from you money..."
Adam T.You agreed to the terms and conditions when you booked.It is hardly the hotels fault the runs were not open. I'm not a skier but isn't this something you can insure against?
"We booked a trip to Little gasparilla island in Florida.I canceled because of the red tide it was so bad you couldn't breathe or go outside. Guess what they want give our money back.the booking manager kept telling me to wait because the red tide might get better it didn't. We are out over $1,700."
"Howell, what do the t&c of your booking say? If your reservation is a non refundable one then I’m afraid you have no right to a refund. Do you have travel insurance? If yes, check the t&c to check if you can make a claim on that."
"Agreed - if you are not in agreement with the terms you are about to book - then do not book. Hotels specify terms for a reason - many because of high demand, or a steeply discounted rate. Once you accept the terms - they are binding like any other legal agreement entered into by two parties.Why should the hotel be hung out as the bad guy - when it is the guest who does not ophold their part of the agreement."
"Am I correct in thinking that you stayed there and want your money back because of some natural phenomenon, Howell?"
Howell why would you expect the hotel to refund for something that had absolutely nothing to do with them??

"As an update to my own saga with booking.com, the fact that you make a non-refundable reservation is one thing. Even if you try to cancel, there is no way to do so. I tried to cancel and ask for a refund because the terms of the booking had changed immediately after payment was made. They refused, and also refused to cancel the booking. After repeated attempts to discuss the matter with the hotel and booking.com, I advised them that I was going to initiate a chargeback with my bank. The chargeback was rejected, and the payment was taken again. The bank in the meantime, credited my account with the funds so that they would only be taken once (taken, withheld during the chargeback process, credited back to me to be taken once again by the merchant because the chargeback was rejected). The bank re-began the chargeback process as they were on my side. The merchant ended up rejecting their chargeback but instead refunded my account, backdating it to my original request to cancel (six weeks ago). The bank has stated that they believe they've done this to avoid additional fees from Visa. I have now been refunded, and the bank has also covered the difference in exchange rate as they switched currencies. I will never book through a third party site again, and if accommodation does not provide their own direct way of booking, I will simply avoid them to ensure that I do not have to deal with multiple parties again in the case of anything going awry."
I had this same issue except there was NO call to the hotel on my behalf like they said. The hotel had no problem cancelling but because it was through booking.com it was up to them to do it. The hotel would have if they could. This is a complete scam and someone in corporate should be held responsible for all of these terrible customer experiences
"I'm surprised that you say a hotel can't cancel a reservation made through Booking.com, because there are reports on this very forum that hotels have doine exactly that, much to their guests disgust.Is it possible that the hotel has not told you the truth, do you think?"
">>>The hotel had no problem cancelling but because it was through booking.com it was up to them to do it. The hotel would have if they could<<<They’ve lied through their teeth.Hotels have complete control and have the authority to cancel at their discretion. Booking.com requires the authority of the hotel to cancel. In fact it takes about 30 seconds for the hotel to log-on to the Booking.com’s extranet and cancel your reservation. Think about this. If you were a hotel owner, would your hotel be dictated by an agent, as to who you can and can’t cancel? No. It’s absurd. It’s now how it works.They’ve point blank lied to you.I’d be sending a very pointed email to the hotel if I were you"
"Had a simular problem with Booking.comOn 11th december '18 I made reservation for one night for 12/12-13/12. I didn't check the confirmation, for some strange reason it was changed into 18/-19/12.I wasn't aware of this. So I drove 330km on 12/12 to the hotel. Arrived at the reception, they said I had not booked. I showed the confirmation of Bookin.com and we saw the dates where 18-19/12.Unfortunately the hotel was fully booked and had no more rooms available that night. After several contacts with Booking.com and the Hotel: DoubleTree by Hilton Luxembourg I couldn't cancel the room.Hotel always said Booking.com is responsibleAnswer Booking.com the hotel is responsible.In the end it was very pricy business trip.Had to search a new hotel: cost: 240€DoubleTree by Hilton charged the room: 135€, even tough they knew the situation; My conclusion: STAY AWAY FORM BOOKING.COM AND DOUBLE TREE BY HILTON LUXEMBOURG"

"Thank you - it was a very stressful situation, and I can now put it behind me."
">>>Arrived at the reception, they said I had not booked<<<>>>DoubleTree by Hilton charged the room: 135€<<<The hotel charged you €135 even after they said you had not booked. Quick question.

"One last addendum to my own saga. After the bank confirmed my dispute was closed, I have been contacted by the apartments and asked to cancel the booking to release it. At no point have I ever been able to cancel the booking. The links in my original booking to cancel the booking took me to a page that sent a request from booking.com to the owners to ask if I could cancel. They refused initially, and that link no longer works. The booking confirmation page takes me to a tiny page with minimal information on it, and has a link to make changes to the booking. This link is broken. I don’t have any way to access a cancellationrequest any longer, presumably because my request was denied initially. I never want to deal with them again, but this saga won’t go away! I have responded advising that I wanted to cancel back at the start of November but they refused me, and I don’t seem to have any way to do it now.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Found one link in an email a month after I tried to cancel, that had a cancel for free button. This worked and I could finally cancel. That email was received during the dispute process, and my bank advised me to ignore it. No other links worked to cancel the booking. Make sure you always file your emails, just in case!"
"I also experienced booking by mistake (wrong hotel). The confirmation page said that it was non-refundable if canceled. However, there was also an option to request for a free cancellation. So I did this, and also sent an email to the hotel explaining my honest mistake. After a few hours, we received a letter saying that they were able to cancel the booking and the charges were credited back to our card. Hope this helps.."

"""Happen to me before and i fell into their trapz again .""Rupert W - what are you talking about? Booking.com is a website platform. Hotels use booking.com to advertise rooms.

"Booking.com can't cancel bookings or grant you special consideration. It's the hotel that does it. This is clear on their website. READ EVERYTHING.The decision by the hotel will depend on how far out you want to change or cancel.I had a problem (see earlier post). I called booking.com. They called the hotel. The hotel agreed to change my booking from no-cancellation to free-cancellation, I was happy. I haven't had any issues with Booking.com.If you want to make last minute changes, book direct with the hotel. But that doesn't guarantee anything.UNDERSTAND THE CANCELLATION POLICY."
"You're right. Booking direct doesn't guarantee you won't have problems. You can still book non refundable rates directly with many hotels and chains, and I've seen complaints from people who have done exactly that without realising it. The difference is that, as they haven't gone through Booking.com or another third party, they can't try and blame the booking site :-)"

Can I cancel a booking and get a refund if I have had an accident and end up in hospital
"Jim,Is your booking one with a Free Cancellation period? If so then check the dates up until you are allowed to cancel and if it’s within that period then cancel it and you should get a refund.But, if your booking is NON-Refundable then that means no refund for any reason. If you chose a cheaper non-refundable deal then that’s a risk as you are hoping nothing will happen to impact your travel plans.If you have had an accident before your trip and are hospitalised and can’t travel then can you claim on your Travel Insurance? Did you take out a Travel insurance policy to cover this trip?"
"I am currently having a problem with a similer issue. After booking a flight via eDreams site, and there was an ad about 40% saving if you book a flight and accommodation together I chose this option. The next thing I was redirected to an accomodation site, with all my details like name,destination, number of days at my destination prepopulated from the flight booking.The only thing I needed to do was to choose a hotel, which I did. The next available option I could choose was ""reserve"", which I did,and was prompted to input my credit card details with an understanding that this was not a final booking but a reservation.After inputing my bank details in a mattet of seconds I immediately got a notification from booking.com that my booking was confirmed and finalised not reserved, and when I tried to rectify this I was informed that my booking was non-refundable and therefore could not change anything without losing all my money.I called my bank immediately to hold this payment, but the hotel had already taken the money from my card. I have used booking.com site for many years with no problem, and had never experienced something like thiswhen I booked directly on their site. I contacted both the hotel and booking.com and they keep sending me back and forth booking.com None of them want to take accountability for the gross misleading happenning between these site, now booking.com sent me to eDreams for sorting this problem as I was redirected from their site. To cut the long story short, I think this is a scam between the hotels, booking.com and the eDreams flight sites where they intentionally misled you to book an noncancellable accommodation enticing you with a 40% saving that does not exist. They all benefit financially when you are stuck with a non cancellation booking, as they can rebook the rooms to another non suspecting guest.My bank has opened a fraud investigation and I am hoping they get to the bottom of this. I am disappointed especially by booking.com, as I have trusted them, I can't say the same for eDreams site and Odalys City hotel in Paris as I have never used them before. Please be careful out there."
It would have been a non-refundable room rate that was used to create the -40% deal which enticed you to book the flight+hotel deal via eDreams and booking.com. You must have missed reading this within the booking flow.
There is certainly no scam on behalf of the hotel or booking.com. eDreams is another matter. If you actually get a flight think yourself lucky. They are the worst OTA around. If you'd have done any research before parting with your money you would never have touched them. Tripadvisor alone is full of complaints about them. I've never seen the divert on eDream that has the details pre-populated. You get the opportunity to add a hotel before you add your personal details or you select flight and hotel before the initial search. Before you pay you can opt for a refundable or non refundable flight and hotel booking. It doesn't mention booking.com either but as eDreams take your money it is them that you have to deal with.
"Your error was to assume that you were making a reservation rather than a booking. To me, the two things are the same anyway, because you are entering into a contract either way, and that contract might include terms such as non refundable and non amendable. In fact, the cheaper the rate offered by the hotel, the more likely that there will be restrictive terms.There are most certainly such rates advertised by hotels on Booking.com. I've seen them and indeed booked them myself when going directly to the Booking.com site. They have always been clearly marked and I have always understood what I was booking.I have no idea how it works when you start out on Edreams, as I've never been anywhere that wretched outfit and I have no intentions of ever doing so."
A reservation is a booking. If you reserve a room then you have made a booking.
"I have a friend who booked a room at the Redoway Inn through booking.com. She thought she had clicked the rufundable booking. But did not. She could not see the 2019 reviews on the hotel. Someone told her not to stay there because of roaches and bedbugs. She finally got to see the reviews for 2019. If she had seen them, she never would have booked. She called booking.com. Told them her situation that they did not want to stay there because of bring home roaches and bedbugs. Booking then called the hotel. They would not cancel. Friend called within the 24 hours after booking. The hotel could have booked it again for sure. They want them to pay 331.20 to cancel. Friend called again. The hotel said they would make sure no bugs would be found in room. Whey cant they just get their money back. Then no bad reviews would be left for booking.com and Redoway Inn and Suites in Jacksonville NC. DO NOT STAY THERE."
"“Whey cant they just get their money back”—> Err, because they booked a non-refundable room rate.The time to research the reviews is before you book. If unsure then pay a little more and book a refundable rate. Your friend messed up."
"Non refundable means non refundable, not non refundable unless you change your mind.Your friend could have seen current reviews for the hotel, but it sounds like she didn't bother to look for them."
"Here is how to help your friend. Teach them the importance of researching hotels before making a booking. Remind them to double and triple check the rules of the booking so that they don't end up booking anon refundable rate instead of a refundable one.Advise them hat if they have booked a non refundable rate it's up to the hotel whether they wish to enforce the terms that were agreed to or not. If the hotel says no to a refund, then that's it. Booking.com can't overrule them.Point out that it doesn't matter if a cancellation is made 24 minutes, 24 hours or 24 days after making the booking. Or even 24 weeks if the stay is a long way ahead. It's all the same unless the booking conditions say otherwise."
"Booking.com will not refund a reservation even though they are the ones who actually take the payment. I booked a 'ski in ski out condo at Mont Tremblant. When I arrived the 100 foot-long (30 metres) walkway was encased in glare ice. No attempt on the owner's part to sand or put gravel there to aid walking up the incline. My husband, unencumbered with luggage actually fell about half way up so we abandoned the idea of staying due to safety concerns. When I requested a full refund we were turned down by the owner and booking.com. My advice to anyone considering booking with booking.com using a private individual owner and their property is DO NOT DO IT! Deal with a reputable hotel, directly."
"Booking.com can't authorise a refund, only the property owner can do that. If they do then booking.com will refund you. If they so no then there is nothing booking.com can do. Booking a private rental without having contact with the owner prior to booking is a mugs game, which is why booking.com isn't the best place to book one. Great for hotels, but not for private rentals."
"Your advice is correct. I wouldn't go near Booking.com for a holiday rental. It's a pity you did, because unscrupulous owners have been using the platform to cheat travellers for quite a while now, unfortunately."

"Silvio V0uk (post #769-770)Please previous posts. This is a public forum on TripAdvisor. This is not a booking.com and there are no booking.com staff that post to this particular thread. Regardless, you need to cancel your reservation through your account which you used to to make your original reservation online. You can also look up the relevant booking.com phone number on their website and call a representative to assist you."
"Silvio, this is not Booking.,com. This is a discussion forum on the travel website Tripadvisor. You will need to contact Booking,com directly. Or you might be able to cancel your booking via your account on the Booking.com website.Now you should delete your own posts because of the private information that you've included in them."

"I guess I can only edit once. To append what someone else mentioned, read the finer details for your hotel bookings. If it says ""free cancellation"" or a time period stipulated before you can cancel, that tells you it's definitely the booking agent. If you call the hotels, they will basically tell you it's the agent. The first time I went through a cancellation with Travelocity, it was easy. They make it out as if they are working with the hotels but they are actually working with their managers to figure out what they can do. Folks get burned by this daily. In the future, always go with an available cancellation policy or talk to the hotels directly.Edited: 1 year ago "
# 774/775What have your posts got to do with booking.com?
">>>If you call the hotels, they will basically tell you it's the agent<<<Aside from what has been asked by LeyLand, you just blindly believe what the hotel tells you?A quick question. If you were a hotel owner, would you let the agent decide your hotel cancellation policy? No."

778.They can take you court and sue for the money owing.
Indeed. Changing or your card or cancelling it is not a sure fire way of getting out of a contract.
Quiero cancelar la reserva q hize el hotel suite los incas Arequipa Perú del 18 al 21 de abril Gracias
You have posted to a public forum. No one here can cancel your reservation.
I made a reservation on Hotel.com and it is non-refundable in Houston Texas for family emergency.
"This thread is about booking.com, not hotels.com. Non refundable means non refundable. Contact your travel insurers if the reason for cancelling is covered."
I accidentally booked a trip whilst I was looking in bed one night. Must of fallen asleep with my finger on the book now. Luckily Booking.com cancelled it and I now don't save my payment details.However recently booked a 14 night non refundable but hotel was infested with cockroaches checked out after few hours I'm getting nowhere with a refund on that. Any advice welcome.
"“However recently booked a 14 night non refundable but hotel was infested with cockroaches checked out after few hours I'm getting nowhere with a refund on that. Any advice welcome.”—> If you reported this matter to the hotel whilst there and there was agreement that you would be able to checkout and obtain a refund for the unused nights stay, then it should just be a case of pushing the hotel for the refund to be made to you, via booking.com or direct from them."
"I'm currently in a hotel in Marrakech after booking through booking.com. there are so many things wrong in the place, WiFi absolutely terrible, keeps cutting out every minute and the TV doesn't work with WiFi. The bathroom shower is nothing like the pictures and shower leaked all outside causing a bit of a flood in the bathroom. The light was flickering in the shower. Generally, it's really poor compared to the pictures etc. I want to make a complaint and cancel / get a refund however would I do this through booking.com or the hotel itself? Would I be able to get any refund? I'm meant to be staying from 26-29 April. Any advice would be helpful, thanks!"
787. Firstly you need to give the hotel chance to rectify this. Ask to be moved to a different room. Ask the hotel what they will do to improve your stay.
"#787As above.Your complaint is with the hotel, not booking.com."
I recently left a 738AUD due to cockroaches in room only stayed 3 hours of a 14 night stay. Been offered 112AUD compensation so if you do leave dont dcpect any refund. I've had to fight hard for the little I've been offered. Which I've turned down
"#785/790 Maria A -I did ask in post 786, did you take this up with the hotelier when there and agree a refund when you said you were going to leave?You typically should give the hotelier a chance to rectify an issue. If leaving before the booked departure day you also need to establish if they will make a refund on unused nights.If you just upped and left and had a prepaid non refundable rate, you would be unlikely to get a refund."
"In the circumstances, Maria, I think you were fortunate to be offered anything. So I think your advice not to expect any refund if you leave a hotel is spot on. I think it is only right and fair to report anything that is not satisfactory to the hotel management so that they have a chance to put things right. If they don't do that when given the opportunity then the guest is going to have a much better chance for a refund of all or part of what they have already paid."
I telephoned the hotel last night to cancel the booking straight away as the ferry we checked earlier was available was not a vailable after booking hotel room first the hotel booking was for the Shanklin hotel on the isle of wight uk we phoned straight away to cancel but only got a telephone call back this morning at 07.00am if someone could email me back thank you
"Sandra, this is the public forum of Trip Advisor where volunteers try to help their fellow travellers. No one here can email you or deal with your request."
793. What ferry were you trying to book? There are 3 car ferry routes to the Island. And 3 passenger only routes. Apart from the Friday of Festival weekend it is extremely rare that nothing is available.
"Sandra, I suggest you contact booking.com directly. I don’t think they monitor Tripadvisor forums like this one so they won’t contact you. It’s just us travellers chatting here and we can’t do anything."
"Sandra, do you want the hotel or Booking.com to email you? Not that it matters, because I suspect that neither of them will see your message. But the point is that it's the hotel's decision when it comes to refunding a non refundable booking with them. Booking.com can't tell them what to do, they can only ask the hotel on your behalf."
"Im in the same situation,hotel said all good advertised,but on arrival now place is dirty,bugs,water leaking threw the roof!how can i contact bookings.com??"
See - Customer Service Help page (see link) near the bottom of the booking.com website https:/…Click the 'Get In Touch' tabYou'll see how to email them for non-urgent matters. Scroll down and you'll see local phone numbers for booking.com that you can call.
"I’m trying to cancel a reservation that I made and they said it was not refundable. I asked why I never received a confirmation by email. They said they sent it, but no where to be found. So the lady Anna told me to go to the store and buy a 100.00 dollar google card and to call her back. She said that she would be able to cancel my non refundable room and give me the 100.00 dollars back. Like what the hell, it has to be a scam. Has anyone had this issue!?"
"Lillian, Who did you make the reservation with?"
I didn't reply because it was difficult finding your reply amongst all this. Yes we took it up with the hotel at the time who had no concerns at all apart from offering a spray for the room. On checking out we was told the manager would be in touch about a refund but after looking at other reviews now this is unlikely to happen. It's not so much about the money now I will just continue giving bad reviews and putting up the pictures. When I return there they will know all about it then.
"Booking.com do not have the last word at all. The hotel is lying to you, which is not unsual in this sort of situation. Booking.com cannot authorise refunds or date changes, only the property you have a contract with can do that. I agree, there is some BS going on, but it's all by the hotel in question. If they can't see the rates on booking.com then it's the hotel with the problem, because they put them on booking.com. If you input the right information then the right information was received by the hotel. The hotel sent the confirmation to you, via booking.com, so if they sent it with the wrong room type (non refundable) that's because they booked the wrong room type. All booking.com do is transfer via the extranet the information you put into their site."
"Leyland has comprehensively covered everything regarding that previous post.I’ll just add this>>>they tell me it’s happened to them personally before and that it happens to customers<<<What do you think would happen to a hotel that frequently kept accepting reservation for wrong dates? And if repeated wrong dates were an issue, would it not occur for flexible reservations also? Or you think by sheer coincidence, that incorrect dates only happen to non refundable reservations?Think about this carefully.They would cop endless complaints and it would be diabolical. If you owned a hotel, would you keep using such a site?It’s one of the worst and illogical excuses that’s used by the most unintelligent hotel staff. It’s ridiculously stupid.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I find it disappointing in the extreme that such a well known brand as Hilton will lie to their customers in such a clear, obvious and ridiculous manner. There is no logic at all in the statement that Booking.com has the final say. If I owned a hotel there's no way I'd allow a booking site to dictate my own policies to me. I find it unbelievable. And I don't mean that I don't believe what you've said. I mean I don't believe that any hotel would think they could get away with telling guests such garbage."
"Absolutely agree RBGuests are so - rightly - blinded by anger at that point, they don’t stop for a second to consider how illogical those pathetic excuses really are."
"It's another lesson, I suppose, in not getting emotional and staying calm and rational instead. It was difficult for me not to get annoyed in Newark when a hotel that I booked directly couldn't find my booking for two rooms, but I gritted my teeth and eventually it got sorted.Anger just clouds the issues and makes it more difficulty to see clearly."
"Hello all, I would like to share my recent experience on cancelling non refundable reservation. Yesterday morning I managed to book this apartment called Gem in City Center in Dublin. And since all my previous booking.com experiences regarding accommodation were great, I didn't want to bother myself to read all the way through when I was making booking.And it was a big mistake. All mention below happen when the booking was already made.First I find out that there is 300 euro deposit that you have to send them before your arrival, if late than your booking gets cancelled and you end up loosing the amount you paid for the whole booking. In my case it was 99 euros. I went immediately on guest reviews and most of those comments were about not satisfied customers, some ended up with loosing amount they payed for booking+deposit 300 euros+cleaning costs that were added on top. In case if their money got return they would get them between 2-3 weeks and sometimes reduced (currency exchange) since the owner lives in Spain.Once I've read all this I decided to cancel my booking to avoid any of this hustle (it was just two hours after booking was made). I wrote to property explaining them reasons why I want to cancel (being totally honest), but they never reply back. So I decided to write to booking.com asking them can I get at least 50 % back if not the whole amount (having in mind that the booking was cancelled in less than two hours). Booking.com was really professional and helpful answering me promptly and informing me that they did communicate with property and asked them to pay me back the whole amount but they said that property decided to return me back 50 % only. Later on someone from booking.com called me on the phone to apologize for this experience. I am also level 2 traveler using booking.com often when booking. I am really happy and satisfied with booking.com but I told the person on the phone that they should be careful with this kind of properties that I had experience with. I am sure (the property) earns much more money from people like me (that don't pay attention on all that is written and ending up cancelling than they do with actual renting). So my advice to you people is TAKE TIME TO READ ALL next time when booking- I know I will from now on."
I booked a twin room at MALDRON hotel in Londonderry for the 6th and 7th August by mistake I didnt notice the non refundable notice until too late I would like to cancel but does this mean I have to pay the price asked
Yes.It’s non-refundable.
"My advice is to contact the hotel. Explain very politely what you have done, admit to making a silly mistake and see if they are willing to allow you to cancel without penalty as a gesture of goodwill.There are no guarantees. They are entitled to enforce the non refundable condition if they so wish, but they might be sympathetic. You will only find out if you ask."
i booked dominican republic for this friday thru tuesday nickelodeon karisma and given the reports and unsafe conditions there i do not want to go with my two small children think its unsafe and they refuse to refund me you can't reach anyone at karisma all of the phone numbers either don't work or lead you to other places the website on the nickelodeon website does not work comes back undeliverable and KHR which is where you book through nickelodeon's website is an agent and the nickelodeon hotels states they have no dealings with KHR which is on nickelodeon's webiste any help would be appreciated?
814.Was this booked through Booking.com as a non refundable reservation?
no it was booked through nickelodeon website.
You need to start a new topic about Nickleodeon.
"TiffyLiz D, You can start a new thread by returning to the forum main page. Then click the green 'Ask a Question' button."
TiffyLiz D has started a new thread (see link) https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12…
"Faced same situation I made hotel reservation twice by mistake but as it's booked in same guest name which clearly depicts that it's a mistake.I called up Booking.com but they said they can try but not sure however they ensured that it's clear a mistake a guest cannot book in same name 2 rooms. But the hotel Mercure London Heathrow dint cooperated us and they charged us mercilessly . This is insane and such an unethical behaviour, can you suggest the way for consumer arbitration and exploitation."
"820. You admit to making 2 reservations, if they were non refundable the hotel does not have to refund you. Booking more than 1 room in the same name would not flag as a mistake. Maybe you can transfer the booking to someone else."
">>>as it's booked in same guest name which clearly depicts that it's a mistake.<<<It doesn't depict that it's a mistake at all, sorry. Many people will be booking two or more rooms. I've done it myself numerous times, both for work and leisure travel.You did make a mistake though. I've made a few in my time and some of them have had financial consequences. You asked the hotel to do you a favour and they didn't want to. That's the way things can be. It's neither insane nor unethical. You entered into a contract and the hotel won't let you out of it. That's it. The end."
"Absolutely agree with both RawT and RBJust as a point of discussion - to ensure this isn’t a language issue - Id be interested in clearing up whether this person booked two rooms in the one reservation, or they booked twice separately (it certainly sounds like the latter - which is actually not that easy to do). And if it is the latter, how far apart the two bookings were made.The hotel is well within their rights to charge - as admitted - and it really has noting to do with Booking.comOn a side note...Once upon a time before the days of drop-in reservations, receiving two identical reservations within a short span of time - like minutes apart - would have flagged a possible dupe - and hotels back then would have contacted the guest to verify if this was a dupe booking, or an add-on.The more automated the systems, the less likely these things are noticed. That’s what consumers have created.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I had a bad experience last week in Budapest. The hotel I booked with non refundable terms ended up a shady place- not matching the images in the booking.com site. There was no AC remote. No security for doors and windows facing an open passage - cld be easily broken into. I , a lady traveller, travelling alone, decided to shift. I am losing 175€ in the process. Rules may be there, but Booking.com shd be responsible enough to organise at least a partial refund. I do not understand how they can just support the hotelier. Shifting was due only to difference between what was offered on the site and the reality. There were brooms, scoops, ironing board, junk lying all over the place!!!"
"That is a terrible experience and nobody should be subjected to that.At the same time, Booking.com cannot be held responsible for the performance, presentation or the product of unscrupulous operators. A room not being like what is displayed in photos, is not new. Some of the biggest hotel chains in the world are equally as guilty.That doesn’t not make it any more acceptable, but equally, it shouldn’t be the travel agents fault. They can only go by what is presented to them by the hotel. No travel agent inspects or audits each property globally.Did you read up on the reviews of the property, cross reference and research it before you chose it? If it’s as bad as you have mentioned, it couldn’t possibly be a one time occurrence.Did you write a scathing review also?I personally would be naming and shaming such a hotel - especially on the Budapest Destination FourmEdited: 1 year ago "
"I don't think it's that Booking,com is supporting a hotelier at all. The truth is that they are impartial. They can only act as a go between. As KVE says they aren't responsible for the operational decisions of any hotel, nor their performance when it comes to service delivery, facilities, maintenance and so on.It's the hotel that has taken your money. It's the hotel that is poorly run. All Booking.com can do is ask them for a refund/partial refund."
how u tell to booking.com ?
<< how u tell to booking.com ? >>What do you want to tell them?
"If you want to tell them you're cancelling a reservation, you can just cancel online."
Have done this accidentally last week 9 months in advance of my booking and they took $500 out of my account immediately will not give it back
"Barbara, the hotel would have charged your card and they set the policies, and the non-refundable terms. If you booked non-refundable then the hotel sounds like they are sticking to their policy. What reason did you give the hotel for wanting your money back?"
"Was it a hotel you booked, Barbara, or some kind of rental. As I understand it, the two work a bit differently on Booking.com.If it's a hotel, then Avanti is absolutely right. It's the hotel that will have taken your payment, and it's the hotel's decision as to whether they will stick rigidly to the T&C's you agreed to or not."
"Just had a hotel default(close) and cease to operate on hotelCom booking. The hotel offered refunds. Hotel.com not only blocked the refund from their end, but required me to purchase a prepaid $USD300 card which I was to assign to them on promise if of a refundThey had hung up on me and the hotel several times. what a scamThe hotel defaults, and Expedia (same co guys) keeps the retirees hard earned savings. I'm out 300, that every other hotel guest was refunded, as the hotel closed, literally.....I didn't change the booking, the hotel did. Hotel.com broke the contract. Beware.Cm"

They would not except that it was an emergency even though the hotel manager agreed that we had to get home before even unpacking as my husband needed medication from home. Don’t use them again as what the manager of the hotel advises! E Gallagher
I have tried to contact them but they refuse to help even though the room was free for rental for those two nights. We are both o er 80 years old and will never book through them again and ha e told ALL our friends and hockey followers to never use them again!!!
They stink!!!!!
Been there tried that with no luck!
"Navigator686316, You say to not use a property again but you didn't state the name of the property (or city) which gave you problems. Do keep in mind that it is the properties that decide to accept your reservation cancelation or change requests made through booking.com per terms of your reservation agreement (terms & conditions). If they would not work with you when you have emergency situations, you can name them here so that others can be made aware and perhaps avoid booking with them in the future."
"BradJill, I get the impression that Navigator is blaming this on booking.com, who obviously aren't to blame. << We are both o er 80 years old and will never book through them again >>It would be good if he could come back and clarify, but I won't be holding my breath."
"Yes, it looks to me as if Navigator is blaming Booking.com for not refunding them on an uncompleted stay, or paying for them to get home in an emergency. I admit I find it incomprehensible to blame either a hotel, a rental owner or a booking company if someone forgets their medication and can't stay, but I'm never going to understand the way some people think."
Just made same mistake and its actually airlines who have cheaper prices if a non-change or cancel flight. It really shouldnt be allowed. We couldnt go last minute and its 400.00 loss.
Come on. You think non-refundable rooms shouldn't be allowed on the basis that you don't understand what non-refundable means?
"Louis D, if you had something interrupt your travels plans (eg. Sickness, accident, travel delay) then you could possibly claim it on your Travel Insurance. That’s what it’s there for.If you book non-refundable hotel deals then you are betting that nothing will go wrong and force you to cancel. If you are unsure or worried that life events will intervene then you could have chosen to book a deal with a Free Cancellation period.You have choices, depending on your needs."
">>>Come on. You think non-refundable rooms shouldn't be allowed on the basis that you don't understand what non-refundable means?<<<Well said. The contention from the other side of the fence, is that guests are all sweet and dandy when they do use their accomodation and gotten a reduced rate. But when plans change last minute, they have a gripe and suddenly think non refundable is somehow unfair."
"“Just made same mistake and its actually airlines who have cheaper prices if a non-change or cancel flight. It really shouldnt be allowed. We couldnt go last minute and its 400.00 loss.”Do you mean you thought only airlines offered cheaper prices for non refundable options? Your mistake. Accommodation providers frequently offer that option. It seems you were happy to take advantage of a lower price but unhappy to comply with the terms and conditions you agreed to. Louis, if you don’t think reduced prices should be allowed then you have a choice. Pay more each time you book a flight, train ticket or hotel. Problem solved. Did you take out travel insurance?"

"Woe to me for making two non-refundable hotel bookings (through Agoda and Expedia) in Hong Kong. Did that to obtain the best rates but who can foretell the violence and unrest in Hong Kong. Seeing the volatile situation, I contacted the hotel (Heritage Lodge in Kowloon) to see if I can cancel and get a refund. I was told that I have to go through the booking agents, I.e. Agoda and Expedia. I did that and received one response today from Agoda which reads as follow:“ to cancel at 50% booking value as penalty. the rest of 50% booking value will be refunded back to you in the form of Agoda cash 114.21USD that valid up to 3 months from issued date and can be redeemed ”I wish I had booked through Booking.com!(High sigh, slump, headache, grunt)Edited: 1 year ago "

"There's nothing you can do as far as I can see, sorry. Booking.com can't force the owners to tell the truth or to refund you. This is one of the big problems in booking apartments through sites like Booking.com. You are basically taking a gamble that the owners will be honest, reliable and honourable people.

"What “same mistake” did you make? A mistake on the dates of stay or something else?When I look on Booking,com hotels usually offer some rooms with Free Cancellation and others (usually at a cheaper price) say Non-Refundable. That’s unusual to book a hotel before booking and paying for flights.Hotels themselves set the policies so if you for some reason cancelled a Non-refundable booking then the hotel is within its rights not to refund. Of course it’s wonderful if a hotel is flexible or lenient and graciously waives its T and C. But they often stick to their guns and Non-refundable means No Refund. Which 5 star Singapore hotel is this?Edited: 1:15 am, September 07, 2019 "
"#866/#867How did you manage to get yourself into that mess? You are unemployed, have no spending money and no flight to Singapore, yet have entered payment information (presumably) into a website and booked a 5* hotel in Singapore for eight nights that you don’t want.You need to seriously stop playing around on your computer."
"I'm as confused as T_U about how this happened. If you are unemployed and can't afford a trip, how did you end up booking anything? I am baffled. As said, you would need to enter payment details in order to proceed. That's one heck of an accident."
Depends on the Hotel. I've cancelled non refunds a couple of times.
"All bookings can be cancelled, but if it's non refundable, you shouldn't expect to get any money back."
"To conclude my problem Booking.com actually gave me a 50% refund, i was the person that booked. My nephew paid at accommodation and the hotel gave him full refund back. So i gained!! Stick and fight your case noone should have to stay in disgusting conditions refundable or not. Make sure you have evidence as well."
#786 Travel-UndercoverHotel what not interested. But i eventually got a 150% refund so i gained in the end.
I did a booking but I'm suppose to go for surgery in a week's time and my doctor ask me to stay put for 6 weeks after the surgery. But the hotel has already credited my credit card and I can't reach them on phone. I've tried contacting booking.com I honestly do hope something good comes out of this. It's so stressful!
I hope booking.com can help salvage my own situation like they did for those who says they were refunded their non refundable hotel fees. Mine is health problem and I've been advised by my doctor not to work or travel for at least 6 weeks. 6 nights is a lot of money for one to forgo. And if I do get my money back booking.com and the said hotel will be recommended by me any day any time
"Maria, non refundable means just that. You agreed a contract to that effect when you booked. Claim on your travel insurance."
"Agree that all ressies can be cancelled. But I'm sure most, myself included, who are commenting on this thread have certainly been reimbursed the money as well."
"Yes, all can be cancelled. But not all are eligible for a refund. If something says non-refundable then don’t expect a refund, unless of course if the hotel is flexible and kindly agrees to offer a refund when they really don’t have to. Many hotels when contacted will not give a refund on a non-refundable booking as that was the contract entered into."
Try Selling the reservation on Cancelon.comthey take care of everything - you just need to post the information and select the price of selling.can be a great money saver - I buy more non refundable reservations since I learned that they exist...
"You certainly can be reimbursed, even on a non refundable rate if the hotel decides to offer a gesture of goodwill. It has happened to me once, and I have been extremely grateful.But I don't think that is particularly common. I believe the majority of travellers who cancel a non refundable booking will lose their money, unless they happen to be covered by their own travel insurance."
I cannot go because of health issues. Booking. Com says the hotel will not give me a refund. I am going to try my holiday insurance and I don't hold much hope there
muff....it's what insurance is for! As long as it's not a pre existing that your insurers haven't been informed of....
"I'd guess you're likely to be covered as Raw T says, unless you omitted to tell them about pre existing health conditions. That's never a wise thing to do."
If you have to cancel a non refundable reservation and find out the hotel was sold out of rooms that night don’t they have to give you a refund? Isn’t it against the law to double sell your room.
Could you explain what law you are referring to? Is there perhaps one in your unknown location? There is no such law in the UK as far as I'm aware.
">>>If you have to cancel a non refundable reservation and find out the hotel was sold out of rooms that night don’t they have to give you a refund? Isn’t it against the law to double sell your room<<<Your post makes no senseIf you cancel, the hotel won’t be sold out - your room is available."
"I booked a reservation for Midtown Hotel in New Orleans on Priceline.com which operates under the Booking.com service umbrella for hotel reservations. The reservation was from Oct 17 to 21st. I arrived on October 18th, and was told by the hotel that my 4 day reservation was cancelled by them due to my late arrival. Further, they have no rooms available for me for October 18-21 but I will be still charged a 4 day stay. They refused to deal with me directly and said that I need to go through booking.com to get a refund.Booking.com refused to refund me the remaining 3 days stay in spite of the fact that I was physically present at the hotel to receive the product (hotel room) which I paid for, but no product was provided to me.When I informed Booking.com of my intent to file a fraud complaint with the credit card company, they immediately issued a booking cancellation notification email, even though I never cancelled the reservation. They proceeded to harrass me by calling me at 2am my time to give me the same story alleging that ""non refundable"" means that they won't refund the money even though I presented at the hotel for the remaining 3 days of reservation that they didn't honor.Of note, the credit card charge is by the hotel and not by booking.com. Seems that the website acts as an umbrella to shield the hotel from any responsibility allowing it to fraudulently refuse to provide the purchased service without returning the money.Avoid booking.com, book directly."
"If your booking is long-term, the U.S.Consumer Protection Act expects the hotel to exercise due diligence in getting another client. It is not allowed to double dip."
I booked a hotel in beruit and wasn't able to go through illness. Booking. Com phoned the hotel and I was told I would not receive a penny. Booking. Com pestered me with 40% discounts on hotels otherwise I wouldn't have gone I was furious with booking. Com telling me I was genius level 2 and what savings I could save 411 dollars down the drain some saving.
"Muff, why not claim on your travel insurance?"
"muff, if you booked a non-refundable room then the hotel set that policy and it was them who stuck to their policy and won’t refund you because of your illness. Some hotels are flexible and do offer refunds on a non-refundable deal, even though they don’t have to. I don’t think it happens a lot, but I have seen people say the hotel was generous and flexible. Other hotels stick firm to the T and C the customer agreed to and won’t refund a Non-refundable deal. I guess we shouldn’t expect them to.You could have claimed on your Travel Insurance if illness stopped you from travelling, that’s what Travel Insurance is for, to cover you when the unexpected happens. Did you decide to protect yourself and take out insurance for your trip? If not, then you take a gamble that nothing will go wrong or stop you from arriving at the hotel.Not sure why some marketing from Booking,com makes you furious. I get emails from booking sites like Expedia and Hotels.com (I don’t really use Booking,com). I just ignore the silly emails saying I’m Silver level and here are some amazing hotels to book, or prompting me to BOOK NOW. I also never believe the 40-60% off claims on any website. When I do some checking it’s not real, so It’s just marketing and all companies do it.Are you saying you were powerless to resist or felt compelled to book a trip because of this kind of marketing or flattery saying you were Genius level 2?"
"muff, you chose the cheaper option of a non refundable booking. If the hotel won't refund on a non refundable room what has that got to do with booking.com? The hotel sets their policies and only the hotel can override them as a gesture of good will. Why didn't you claim the cost back on your travel insurance?If a few emails upset you so much then just unsubscribe."
"Being ill is unfortunate but it doesn't qualify you for a refund on a non refundable rate, sorry. Some hotels might choose to return your money out of the goodness of their hearts, but normally it's something you would claim on your travel insurance.It really has got nothing at all to do with Booking.com"
"I made a booking by mistake on the 5th of November wile on a bussiness trip. I searched accommodation in Worcester South Africa booked and paid. I recieved confirmation of payment in Pounds and saw I was charged 39£, checked and saw I booked in Worcester UK. My search had South African and UK accommodation jumbled together and all appeared in South African Rand currency. I immediately cancelled and booked another place in Worcester South Africa. I noticed no refund. I contacted booking. com who said I must take it up with the Merchant. I explained all and proved all but the Merchant wants to be unethical and use their no refund clause. I find this criminal. I'm trying to have my bank reverse my credit card payment."
"“I made a booking by mistake”Yes - and a very unfortunate one, especially when booking the cheapest non-refundable room. Booking.com can and have asked the hotel to waiver the charge but the hotel it seems are sticking to the terms of the booking you both agreed to. A bit rich of you to then say - “Merchant wants to be unethical and use their no refund clause. I find this criminal.”Not really criminal. You goofed up. Take some personal responsibility. “I'm trying to have my bank reverse my credit card payment.” - good luck with that."
“the Merchant wants to be unethical and use their no refund clause.”What exactly is unethical about sticking to the terms and conditions you agreed to please?
"“the Merchant wants to be unethical and use their no refund clause.”What exactly is unethical about sticking to the terms and conditions you agreed to please? You may find it criminal, but it isn’t and you need to be very careful about making accusations like that on a public forum."
"Hi,Is it possible to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.com due to travel ban advisory? The manager of the hotel already charged us in credit card. But due to unfortunate situation we want to redate the booking. Please us on this matter.Thank u"
"It is up to the hotel. They are entitled to stick o the terms of the contract you agreed to, or they could decide to make a gesture of goodwill. As is the case with Angelique, you have no rights to a refund if you booked a non refundable rate.You can either contact the hotel yourself, or you can try and get Booking.com to do so. There are no reps posting here to the best of my knowledge."
When you book you enter into a legal contract.A legal contract that you are supposed to have read and when you book you agree to the terms of that contract.The situation of booking an hotel and then no wanting to go because of one countries travel advisory is not grounds for a refund. The hotel is still offering you the accommodaiton you agreed to so they are keeping their side of the contract.The people who are issuing the travel advisory are only advising. They are not saying you are forbidden to go. That is your choice and your decision. It's unfortunate but better your family is safe and you loose some money than you risk whatever the problem is.
"What part of non refundable do the one post wonders on this thread not understand?The cheapest bookings in the travel world almost always come with the most restrictions...flights,trains...and hotels....booking.com often offers me 2 rates...the higher one can be cancelled...the lower one cannot....even a degree in stupidity will not change the obvious..."
">>> Is it possible to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.com due to travel ban advisory? The manager of the hotel already charged us in credit card. But due to unfortunate situation we want to redate the booking. Please us on this matter<<<I absolutely agree with everyone above, but you are asking something that maybe unnecessary. A cancellation is not always requirement for a date amendment.Although it’s typically covered in the terms for a non refundable reservation, there are two common scenarios whereby a hotel *may* agree to a date change; 1. If the rate you have paid for your room type is considerably higher than on the date you wish to change it to, AND you agree to maintain that rate. 2. You’re willing to pay a supplement upfront to match the rates on the new date AND agree to whatever additional fee is imposed.Regardless, it still comes back to the advice given already - it’s entirely at the discretion of the hotel. You have nothing to lose by contacting the hotel directly, but word it correctly. As in do not use the word ‘cancellation’Edited: 7:29 am, November 16, 2019 "

I booked a room in the uk it cost me £50 and it was not fit to stay I'm the bathroom ceiling was Brown the curtains were hanging on string the window ledge was all broken and very dangerous so I did not stay there very disgusting can I get a refund the owner said contact Booking.com
"#905I hope you took photos/videos as evidence.If it was as said....contact booking.com,tell them you are putting the payment into dispute with your card...then contact the bank etc..."
Now is probably a good time to point out that the operational condition of the room is not the responsibility or fault of Booking.com
"Luke,I wonder what the reviews of this dreadful hotel were like when you researched it on various booking sites and also when you read it’s reviews and saw candid guest photos on TripAdvisor? You mention “room” and “owner”...Was it a hotel or some kind of private lodging?"
"The owner should not have referred you back to Booking.com if this was a hotel, they could and should have sorted things out themselves.But I suspect that this was some sort of rental. As I understand things, Booking.com take payments for some rentals on behalf of the owner. I think that this was a poor decision by BDC as it will lead to more people blaming them when they encounter poor properties as in this case.It was their decision to make, though, and they will have to live with any negative consequences."
"hi , i received a message from bank , that i have spend SGD88 on this fragrance hotel oasis, which i never made any booking on this hotel. i have call my bank ,and they told me i already make a payment with this booking.com for this hotel, how can im do cancel."
"Was it a payment by credit card? Contact your bank again. If you didn’t make the booking then someone has stolen or cloned your credit card details somehow and used them to book that hotel. Again tell your bank you did not book any hotel on booking,com and you are concerned about the security of your credit card. Ask them to investigate and deal with it.Fragrance is a brand of cheap hotels in Singapore, and I think there is a Fragrance Oasis hotel on Balestier road, Singapore. If you have not been looking on Booking,com recently at hotels in Singapore then someone was and booked it."
"Cherry W. If you didn't make a reservation at this hotel. You need to call your bank back and inform them that someone is using your card details without your knowledge. You will have to cancel your card and check the security on your phone/computer, possibly having to change passwords etc."
"Yes, you absolutely need to inform your card provider straight away that you have no knowledge of this transaction. I expect the outcome will be that you will be refunded, your card will be cancelled and a new one issued."
I actually am in the process of trying to get my money back. I would have never booked a non refundable room. They kept $1276.00 and the Holiday Inn Express manager in Gatlinburg Tennessee said I would not get my money back. I booked it through Trip advisor. This is insane. Who can just give away $1276.00 dollars? What a scam. I canceled a month in advance.
They took $1276 out of my bank and said they would not give it back. This is insane. I had no idea I booked a nonrefundable room.
#915Bottom line is people make mistakes booking things online all the time......I use Booking.com all the time..and they are as clear as most to use....I can only speak from the hundreds of times I have used them...
I made an booking of a hotel non refundable and then later that day my father decided he wanted to come so had to book another room but we changed accommodation as was cheaper to book a two bed apartment then two rooms. I emailed the hotel as they hadn't taken money from my revolt card to ask to cancel as booking is several months away and a few days later they tried take money on two separate days but I had removed the money. Is there anything else they can do?
917. They could sue you for the money you owe them.
"That's right. You have entered into a contract, Louise and you can't revoke that contract simply by not having the means for them to take what you owe.So they could take action to recover the funds you agreed to pay them. Whether they will do that, I have no idea, but they most certainly could."
I'm wronglly booking.
"Sharmilla, no one here can help you. This is the public forum of Trip Advisor where volunteers try to help their fellow travellers. You need to contact whoever you booked with and provide more details"
"I want to cancel my refundable reservation for Dec. 28 at the Geneva Motel in Geneva, my code is D3E9033. PLEASE let me know ASAP that it is canceled."
"922. Mary. You will need to cancel your reservation through the My Bookings tab on Booking.com, if you can't do this, you will need to telephone BDc customer service."
"Yes Mary, this is just a public travel forum on TripAdvisor website where we travellers chat. There is nobody here from Booking,com who can cancel things for you."
I wish to cancel one room at Howgarths Stone Manor Kidderminster for 4th January.It appears on booking in at the hotel 2 rooms have been booked I know I only booked one room for 4th January and have the email for proof.Both myself and my partner have found this very distressing.Yours sincerely Lynn Newitt
"#925. LynnThis is a public travel forum, not BDc. You need to go to manage bookings and cancel the room there.As the reservation is for this evening, you could phone the hotel directly."
"925.When did you book this accommodation, it would appear that they offer free cancellation up to 2 days before arrival. Why have you waited until arrival day to cancel?"

How to cancel a non-refundable reservation on booking.com
"Palitha,Have you read through some of the replies on this long topic?If something is non-refundable then you won’t get a refund. If you want to cancel your booking then I suggest going to the booking.com website and accessing your booking in your account. If you choose to cancel then it means no refund."
Hi I booked on booking.com an cancel the next hour on my credit card they say waiting period is 7-10 days I've been waiting now for 7days are they ganna refund me
931. They said 7-10 days.
"Also, would be it 7-10 working days? So maybe wait a few days longer."
It's normally business days in my experience. So that's probably the 1st January out!
Same thing happened to me. I booked refundable but they booked non refundable and charged my credit card. And wont refund me the money. Seems like a scam to me. And allowing a year to rebook is not feasible unless u live with a 2 hr flight range or something. I'm not gonna pay $1500 pp flight again so I can use $1500 to re look my hotel. Scam on the hotel part too!
"lyznation, booking.com don't book anything. All they do is send the information electronically you input into their site direct to the hotel. You either selected the wrong room type by accident or the hotel made a mistake. Who charged your card, booking.com or the hotel? It would the hotel most of the time, although booking.com do handle payments for some properties now. Your card statement will tell you which one. That won't change the fact that booking.com are not responsible for booking the rooms though.Which hotel was it?Edited: 5:36 am, January 09, 2020 "
935.So the hotel has generously offered to rebook you. Why did you cancel? Can you not claim on your travel insurance?
"HiToday i booked Crowne Plaza Hotel Manchester Airport over the phone, when i received confirmation e-mail it had me booked at the City Centre Crowne Plaza, Manchester.I rang Crowne Plaza Reservations and they were very apologetic but refused the change it - even though it was their fault -to the correct hotel as it was a non-refundable booking.I rang the hotels direct to see if they could help but they told me to ring guest reservations as they probably could help.I was kept on hold for over half an hour , i put the phone down and rang back and was told no way can they change the booking as it was locked in the system and if i cancel i will lose my money.Surely this cant be right and there must b a way they can transfer my booking to the correct hotel - we have an early morning flight and do not want to stay in the city centre .Anyone have any advice on anything other body i can contact to put this right please"
"#938Always book online,then you have proof...sorry you may have lost this booking...but you could have lost a lot more,so look on the bright side....call them up and cancel your account...if you are important enough you may get something offered as a bonus..."
"#938AFAIK BDc record some of their phonecalls, get back to them and ask if they can review your reservation phone call.Edited: 3:26 pm, January 09, 2020 "
Why would you ring booking.com rather than booking online? For Crowne Plaza at MAN they're usually no cheaper than booking direct.
"Sorry i should have started a new topic for this , i didnt book with booking.com but with Crown Plaza reservations direct .Thanks"
"Phone booking.com! I was advised by the booking.com customer service agent that my non-refundable reservation had a 24h ""cooling off"" period. That allowed me to cancel my reservation immediately without any penalty charges"
"942We mostly use BDC,even for a chain...and have always been ok...but online keeps a record of events...just put it down to experience...and it's a small amount to loose in comparison to what many others have.....by the way....if you could mess up posting a warning on the wrong thread is it possible you were perhaps not crystal clear to the call taker?"
Never going to use booking.com their phone number for Ireland does not even ring why are they so hard to contact money grabbers...
"#945Could you have misdialled?What number are you trying?Keep in mind that online companies want you to interact with them online, transaction wise and contact wise in many cases.Edited: 4:43 am, January 11, 2020 "
"Hi Thanks all for replies 942- I didnt mess up posting a warning on the wrong thread , i meant to post it on here as the OP had a similar problem although mine wasnt my fault.I meant i probably should have put it as a new topic after i saw that some of the posters thought i booked with booking.com like the OP.I Will book with them in future!Edited: 9:33 am, January 11, 2020 "
"Fair enough, but do keep in mind that a thread has a common theme, which is Non Refundable Reservations on Booking.com, and posting a complaint which is not associated with the common theme can confuse and create false impressions for those who haven’t followed the entire thread Additionally, the OP posted five years ago and hasn’t returnedEdited: 12:22 pm, January 11, 2020 "
"my staff booked a reservation without my knowledge. I recently booked a reservation with the same hotel and found out that a reservation had already been made in my name without my permission. the reservation was 1931293747 the pin is 0821,Says it is non-refundable. I would like this removed . I have already made a new reservation with the same hotel for Apr 3-4 of this year. the new reservation is 3685298688 pin is 1277. Please resolve this . I am firm for the April reservation. I was not aware of the feb reservation."
"Robert Z,This is not booking,com. You are just on a TripAdvisor travel chat forum and we are just TripAdvisor members and travellers.You have given out your personal booking details on a public forum. That’s not a wise idea.If you want to sort out your bookings then go to the Booking.com website."
#949 - Robert Z'my staff booked a reservation without my knowledge.'Say it ain't so!
I doubt either Booking.com or the hotel will be at all interested in rectifying a mistake made due to a singular lack of communication in Robert's organisation. Especially if Robert expects them to refund a non refundable booking.I'm just wondering if maybe Robert's company might be Edreams or Kiwi.com...
"I just had a similar situation with an non-refundable room I booked on Hotels.com. I was highly skeptical that I could do anything about it. I first called the hotel directly, and they referred me back to Hotels.com, and I was certain that would be the end of the line. But when I got customer service at Hotels.com, the rep was extremely professional, polite and efficient. She offered to call the hotel on my behalf, and left me on hold for less than 5 minutes. Mission accomplished! She returned to tell me the room was cancelled, and I received confirmation via PayPal within 5 minutes that my account had been refunded. All in all, an extremely positive experience. I will continue to book through Hotels.com based on this highly responsive customer service experience."
"There is no connection between Booking,com and Hotels.com so I am unsure why you have posted on a Booking.com topic.Probably would have been better to add your Hotels,com experience onto one of the existing Hotels.com topics."
Hi I had cancelled booking straight away and still waiting on the money they took out my bank even hotel I called direct to say booking had been cancelled and to get in touch with booking.com which I did and still took the money which they are not allowed to do I was told I've emailed several times to booking.com in last 2 days to which nothing no response whatsoever even called won't answer of that do just and call .
956. Was this as per the original topic.....a non refundable reservation?
"If it wasn't a non refundable booking then I'm sorry, but the post should not be in this thread. If it was a non refundable booking then I'd expect nothing back, I'm afraid."
It doesn't matter when you cancelled it if it was a non refundable room. Did booking.com take the payment or was it the property. What does your card statement say?
Please I need a number to call booking.com. I mistakenly booked a non refundable hotel in London and was deducted the very next day and my official trip was cancelled. The hotel has told me to call booking.com but I don’t have any number to reach them
"Have you looked on the booking,com website or APP? That’s where all the Customer Support contact details would be (email and phone).The hotel is responsible for enforcing the Terms and Conditions of the booking, eg. It being non-refundable. Did they say they would give you a refund on the non-refundable booking? Or did they say nothing and just tell you to contact Booking,com?"
"If the latter there's a high chance that the hotel is simply passing the buck. It's their decision, but sometimes hotels like to pretend it's not!"
Oprah Winfrey or Ellen DeGeneres needs to here about this to help is.vtgis bullying hotels are making money by stealing from the consumer.
I will never use booking dot com or stay at a Drury hotel!!! Ever neither will my family
"Bullying hotels making money by stealing from the customer? As in you’ve agreed to a non refundable condition in exchange for a lower rate, but for whatever reason you couldn’t stay, and now you’re changing your tune about what you agreed to.Unless you provide specific details, the above is all we can assume from your posts. But regardless, Im guessing it’s got nothing to do with Booking.comEdited: 7:11 am, January 29, 2020 "

"hello, I made the same mistake but in the same they they refuse my Visa card so Can I cancel now ??"
968. You can always cancel a reservation.
"Hi there,I've made non refundable reservation that required deposit of 30% to be paid immediately. My credit card hasn't been chared, hotel didn't send me paying instructions neither. I've tried to reach them several times, but they didn't respond. I am very suspicious and don't want to put my self in situation to drive over 1000 km - in high season- just to be told that my reservation is not valid because I didn't pay a deposit.I can't cancel it, because it is not refundable. I have sent request for cancellation without fees, but they didn't respond to that also.This is a good hotel with over 200 reviews and score 9/10 and I am not sure what to do."
I'd wait and see. Maybe they will charge your card in the next few days. How long has it been since you made the reservation?
"970. Check your booking status on ""my bookings"" or ""manage my bookings"" Is your booking live?"

973.Who are you replying to?
"Can a non refundable prepaid hotel reservation be cancelled and the payment be refunded due to the Coronary virus, and travel restriction"
"virgiliol540, You'll have to contact the hotel directly to ask."
"“Can a non refundable prepaid hotel reservation be cancelled and the payment be refunded due to the Coronary virus, and travel restriction”—> That would be a good-will gesture made by the hotelier. On a Non-Refundable rate, as the name suggests, in return for a cheaper room rate the room doesn’t qualify for a refund if you cancel. You have no automatic right to get a refund but no harm in asking them. Don’t however get annoyed with them if they stick to their terms and say No.—> A claim on travel insurance may be possible if your Government has advised against travel to that particular country. I doubt however they will pay out for simple disinclination to travel."
"975.If a travel restriction is in place then this is where your travel insurance comes into play.Please don't expect your accommodation to refund you, it is not their fault,. Where the huge chain hotels can probably ride this out. I can see a lot of small independent businesses having a devastating season."
"I agree. I believe that some hotels will go to the wall, even without providing gestures of goodwill to guests who've booked non refundable rates."
"#979'I believe that some hotels will go to the wall,'Good Morning Roj,,,Very true,desperation has already crept into the markets in places like Thailand and Malaysia.If you know where to go BA are doing Business class holidays to Bangkok for less than £600.....and 9 days in a premium resort in Langkawi for less than £1,000!!How long before the smaller hotels cannot compete? The lack of China based tourists is killing the Far East Tourist areas."
I forgot my confirmation number when I booked at hotel Express and now I can't get my money back how can I get at least some of it back
Look in My Bookings on BDc.
"hi Booking Com. My Booking ID-486861460.Our flight February 27 to March was Canceled by Cebu Pacific cause of Epedimic Virus (Corona Virus) that's why,We did not come to check in Novotel Hotel. We have already payed. We would like to back our payed 'money'. That is not our fault.Lolita Daclan & Ellen Drenhaus"
"Pakondo, Did you notify the hotel as soon as your flight was cancelled?"
Post 984Did you book a refundable room? If not you're let entitled to a refund. Even if it was refundable you would need to notify them within the refundable timescale.
Booking .com were so unhelpfulwe had booked a hotel with them in sorrento but did not enter my correct email address so therefore did not recieve comfirmation of the booking. So we could not not csncel it. First thing we knew was when my bank account was charged for that hotel we had stayed in another apartment. We actually went on our last day to the actual hotel but they were not interested even though i explained the situation thank you not zi teresa... we communicated before two days before we were even due at the hotel with booking.com with no joy and even when we come back with no happy result from hotel or booking.com thank you for robbing me of £800 for a booking we werent aware of as no confirmation so could not cancel and for zi teresa not even slightly interested and robbed us for the full amount even knowing we wouldnt be even in the country for some of the nights.. nothing good to say about booking .com at allllll
#987Who input the incorrect email address? Would this not be an online booking?What rate category did you book? If non-refundable then a refund would not be due if you wanted to cancel. The hotel could certainly make a concession but they are not obligated to do so. Booking.com can only then follow the instruction of the hotel.
You entered the wrong email address when booking. Why are you blaming booking.com?
"I made a booking with the county hotel in carlisle, and spotted within one hour I had booked the wrong option, I intended to book the free cancellation option, I contacted booking.com immediately and they contacted the hotel immediately and there response was they would not refund or cancel the booking, but would let me change dates if rooms available"
"What you intended to book or how long it took for you to notice, unfortunately has no bearing on the policy or the decision of the hotel. Booking.com has no say in the matter."
"One would hope that a hotel would show some goodwill when someone makes a mistake and notices it pretty quickly. But that's all it is - hope. A hotel is perfectly entitled o enforce the terms and conditions that a consumer has agreed to, whether that's an error on the part of he customer or not."
"Hi. We just did. We called the Holiday Inn first and then Booking.com. They said they would refund the entire amount of the non-refundable reservation because of the Coronavirus. I think we just got lucky, as far as the virus being so wide spread and IHG hotels waiving any cancellation fees. Good luck on yours!"
We are hoping that our bookings for Italy and England will be refunded even though they were unrefundable bookings. We are not able to fly anywhere it seems without being at risk and we are a month away from leaving. I don't think we can risk flying anywhere and then be in quarantine for 2 weeks on our return. I am trying to contact booking.com but they are obviously not wanting to speak to anyone because of the volumes.
#993You may wish to be proactive and contact each of the hotels yourself to ask nicely about a penalty free cancellation. It is the hotels at the end of the day which make the determination. If they agree I would ask them to send you a confirmation of them relaxing the normal policy. Having this may help when you finally make contact with booking.com. The hotel can also instigate the change process with booking.com if that is what you decide.
I want to know if I made the reservation for Vancouver Washington not Vancouver Canada

"Am I able to postpone trip, due to the corona virus? We are a party of 10 coming from different areas in the U.K., 3 ladies that are within the vulnerable category! If a postponement is possible would we have to give a new date,, this would be difficult as we don't know if we will be going into lockdown in next few months. The apartment manager has agreed to this but has referred us to booking.com. We are going to Edinburgh, most of us are flying. Thank you"

Hello. We have had to cancel our sons’ wedding in the south of Italy due to the shut down of the country. Many of our guests need to cancel their non-refundable reservations at booking.com not because of personal reasons but because of the state of Italy as a country who has been hit the hardest by Covid-19. The guests who have tried to cancel and asked for a refund have been refused. What should we do to assist the guests.
"New Orleans reservation to La Rechileu confirmation # 2211164855 under Mary Umstattd for 3/19-3/22. Hello. I need to cancel this due to the circus media about the Coronavirus. As of noon today all NO museums, events over 250 people and tours have been closed down. My airlines is notifying me that there is no guarantee if I can leave or return and to cancel ASAP.May I cancel this reservation and apply it towards another date at La Richelieu? I have contacted the hotel and they said many people from Booking.com have canceled today, but the hotel can't do that directly. I am so disappointed. Please help. Mary Umstattd"
"I would not dream of saying such unfriendly things about Booking.com as I use them most of the time. However, I am caught up in this Covid19 virus in Spain and thought I might be able to qualify for a refund on a non-refundable trip. I am going round in circles. Booking.com refers me to the property owners saying they will issue me with a refund and the property owners refer me back to Booking.com saying that they will issue me with a refund. So going nowhere with this. Cant make any headway with the online helpline at all"
"This sounds like a private rental? Only the property owner can decide whether you get a refund or not. On a non refundable booking it would usually be a claim from your travel insurance. If booking.com facilitated the payment then the owner would have initiate the refund before booking.com could refund you. If the property owner processed the payment then they would have to refund you, if that is what they decide to do. Your card statement will tell you who the payment was taken by."

I really think they need to advise on cancellations due to coronovirus.
">>>I really think they need to advise on cancellations due to coronovirus<<<There is nothing for Booking.com to advise. All cancellation and refund policies are that of the respective properties. You should be asking the propertyEdited: 7:47 am, March 16, 2020 "

No comments...In a situation where all flights to Morocco are stopped, when we have no possibility to leave our country, it seems, booking.com has removed itself?"
Felisks. In this situation I suggestion you claim on your travel insurance.
"Felisks, it has nothing to do with booking.com. The hotel make their own policies and they are the ones that have offered a possible resolution. This is no more their fault than yours. Travel insurance is the way to go on this, and hopefully you have a policy that covers this situation."
Booking.com has declared Force Majeure/Forced Circumstances https:/… our travel insurance company has referred to this link
The link doesn't work but if it's the page I think it is then perhaps you should refer the owner to it?
"Sorry,no comma at the end : https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/help/legal…"

I was ment 2 go 2 Dublin 4/6 of April now the concert has been cancelled bookings . Com want 2 charge me 225 our of 685 2 cancel as it is none refundable now they want 2 keep all 685 we don’t want to go as Dublin is on lockdown and nowere open what should I do? Does my MasterCard cover me ? Pls help
"Darin,You mean the hotel you booked wants to charge you as its the hotels themselves who set and enforce their own cancellation policies. Booking.com does not set the policies.How could the cancellation policy have changed? You said it was non-refundable (that usually means no refund at all) but you say the hotel was going to charge you 225. Then you say you now don’t get any refund of your 685. Sorry, I do not understand how the hotel could have one policy when you booked but now change that?"
I completely agree. I made a mistake once & booking.com were amazing and I got my refund. I did notice straightaway so when I called the hotel hadn't even confirmed the booking.
Well said
Talk nice to the hotel and they may let you move the booking
email them and you might be able to move..but know for future to book directly and get discounts
Yes..if you are sure Dublin hotels are closed and your Hotel is unavailable
You cant...booking.com will not move an inch !! try calling the Hotel and work out an alternative date

"You are very lucky enough. In my situation here in the Philippines, we tried many times to contact booking.com but unfortunately their hotline number is unreachable or not working. I was trying to look for the email address just to contact them because I had booked a non-refundable reservation in Cebu City. But because of this Covid-19 issue, all the flights going to Cebu City were cancelled and also flight coming from my city is restricted. Can you help me please on how I can make my request for refund. Thank you. -Jonnel Martinez"
"Jonnel, you need to contact the hotel, it is up to them if they wish to refund."
Thanks RawT. I asked my friend in that City to visit the hotel but unfortunately my friend received a very disappointing answer. They informed my friend to call booking.com and gave an email address. We can't contact the hotline and no one is answering on the local number. Tried to send on the email address but received an autoreply message. I think the hotel should refund me or at least just hand me a voucher for future reservations of the same number of nights to stay.
"Jonnel, if it's a non refundable reservation, then the hotel doesn't have to refund you anything. You really need to telephone the hotel yourself and ask. If a refund us not offered, then ask if you can transfer the reservation to a later date."
"I have made an irrefutable booking but down to this virus i wish to cancel, can i ??"
"1036. Any reservation can be cancelled, you won't necessarily be offered a refund though."
Booking cancelled due to Corona Virus. Any way to get a refund?
"hwilinsky,Who Cancelled the booking? Was it a non-refundable booking and you cancelled it? If you booked a non-refundable deal then usually that means no refund. The hotel itself (or whatever type of accommodation you booked) sets the terms and conditions and you agreed to them. But some hotels have been showing flexibility and offering refunds, but it’s up to each hotel I guess. Some are sticking to their T & C and saying no refund. Have you contacted the accommodation and explained and politely asked if they can offer any refund in the situation? They may work with you and offer some refund, or they could say no. Not sure what will happen, but maybe give it a try."
"If you are giving sufficient notice e.g. over one month,you would think it would be possible to refund the monies for the bookingDavid"
"#1039If you selected and paid the slightly higher price for a flexible change/refund room then, yes.If you selected and paid for the cheaper, restrictive, non-refundable room the notice period doesn’t come into it. From the moment you bought that non-refundable room, it’s non-refundable."
"David, I'm not sure why you would think that. Unless, of course, that is what is provided for in the terms of the contract.There may well be some contracts that will allow for penalty free cancellation up until a month out from the stay. I've seen plenty of different cut off dates when looking for and booking accommodation in the past.These will typically be called something like semi flexible as they are compromise between fully flexible and non refundable.There is no set rule, though. And as T_U rightly says, most of the cheapest non refundable rates mean exactly that from the moment you commit."

"Peggy,You would need to look at your booking details email and maybe there is a link on there to manage your booking, or look on Booking,com website. Nobody here is associated with booking,com so nobody on this public Tripadvisor travellers forum can help you cancel it.If you booked a non-refundable deal then you wouldn’t get any refund if you cancel. You could contact the hotel and politely ask for a refund, but they may stick to their Terms and Conditions and say no."
Your over 65 and afraid because of the coronavirus to travel. The government and President are saying not to travel stayat home.They don't know when the crisis will end. It's our Social Security limited MONEY WE saved for the trip.Its not our fault and we could use the money.
What about the fear of being 66 yrs old and the CORONAVIRUS. GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT say stay HOME DON'T travel
"Sonny, you have posted the same thing 3 times. We are just travellers here, so if you have a booking issue you would need to contact booking,com and the hotel or whatever accommodation you booked. It’s up to the accommodation to either choose to be flexible and compassionate in the current circumstances if you want or need to cancel, or they may say no refund and stick to the Terms and Conditions you booked.I think all of us travellers hope that hotels would be understanding in light of this crisis, and some are. That’s wonderful. Other hotels are not. You have not said what happened to you? Did you book a non-refundable deal and the hotel will not refund?"
"A very unpleasant experience with Booking.com Customer Service Assistance over the cancelation of hotel booking due to COVID-19 travel restriction. It is a non-refundable booking, but a cancelation is needed now that is beyond everyone expectation and control. i had few telephone conversation with Booking.com, they simply pushes the responsibility over the hotel. As requested, i have engaged and gotten favourable reply in writing that i can cancel my reservation. However, the procedure is made possible through Booking.com.Again calling Booking.com, a disappointed reply that they are unable to assist me on the cancelation. I have written to Booking.com Customer Service, i have not gotten reply till now. It is frustrating and disappointing with the services rendered. It is a special situation that need extra ordinary assistance, yet the company is not driving a good journeys with customer.How can i escalate the subject to their senior officers?"
1047. Do you have it in writing that the hotel is going to cancel and refund? Or just cancel?
I had booked non-cancellable weeks holiday in Tenerife but as there are no flights to get us there we cannot utilise the accommodation....i've tried contacting Booking.com via webiste and booking number but they keep asking for 4 digit pin but the pin i have is 6 digits and i've tried it so many times. I cannot make contact by phone...does anyone have a contact number i can get through to or another avenue to communicate.Thanks
"1049. Your pin is on your booking confirmation email.Edited: 1:14 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"Thanks, I eventually got to speak with someone from Booking.com and my pin is 6 digits which you cannot do anything on line with ...has to be by phone."
"Hi, Thanks for your quick response! Through a few communication with the Hotel, I have gotten their reply to waive the cancelation fee for the booking. However, the process can only be triggered by Booking.com since they are the travel agent for the booking. I can't help it but to seek Booking.com assistance. Through several calls to the customer service assistance, I am not getting any help to unlock the situation..Who & how to escalate my request?"
"1052.If the hotel has already been paid by BDC. All you will have to do is request to cancel your booking. You can do this online, from your bookings page........as long as your hotel has already confirmed in writing that they will refund."
"1052.What happens?You out in the request, the hotel gets instant notification. The Hotel then agrees to your request and also agrees to waiver all charges.....it just takes a couple of clicks.The Hotel can then refund your credit card. They may need to ask for your card number and expiry date to do this.It is as easy as that."
thanks very much
"Hi, The hotel is not ready to deal with me directly but Booking.com. Called Booking.com for cancelation & refund stating the reply from the Hotel, however it was rejected stating it as a non-refundable reservation. It is simply frustrating and disappointment.. FYI, I did provide my credit card detail to hotel in the very first communication. I have requested to keep my reservation open till the Pandemic is over, but the hotel offer a cancelation instead.Appreciate your assistance and advise to resolve the dead lock.. Thank you!"
"The hotel has to deal with this. I have no idea why they are saying that BDC need to OK it, unless BDC have the funds that you paid for some reason, rather then the hotel.BDC have unfortunately muddied the waters a bit by taking payment for some properties, though that is mostly for holiday rentals rather than hotels."
"1056. Can you find out who has your payment? You can do this by checking your credit/ debit card statement.Edited: 2:24 pm, March 25, 2020 "

I can only think that the hotel are new to BDC.The hotel can request to cancel your reservation online. Stating they are not charging you. BDC then send an automated form to you. You accept the cancellation. BDC will refund you.
Yes had same problem it's up to hotel I've just changed dates for next year for one hotel. Not getting much luck with the orther one good luck hope that will help keep safe
"Doesn't always work out that well. As Booking.com will tell you it's totally at the discretion of the motel/hotel and won't get involved. Due to an annoying quirk of the booking.com page the date keeps defaulting to today's date while booking without warning if take a bit too long. This happened to me. Even though discovered quickly and booked the correct date at the same establishment, they were still quite happy to take my money for the first booking without any refund despite not being heavily booked on that night and could have refunded without loss. Just plain greed."
1063.All businesses are allowed to abide by their terms and conditions.You say you did then rebook the correct dates. Did you contact the hotel first to see if they would amend your reservation?
"I have a hotel book in spain and it'no refundable. The country is on lock down now.would the hotel rearrange my new dates for free?Or refund me?AndrewEdited: 7:51 pm, April 01, 2020 "
This depends entirely on the decision of the hotel. I would advise to contact the hotel directly to obtain a response.
"Ok my experience mirrors yours. I read the booking.com policy regarding the virus crisis and was initially confident that although I had a refundable reservation in could still request a refund. I called booking.com and was put on hold while they called the hotel. This was March 17th the day the panic hit London and the supermarkets were being cleaned out. The hotel manager apparently disagreed that anything was wrong and said I could cancel but the fee would be the entire amount. My reservation was for 30 DAYS so the amount is significant. I explained to booking.com that we are coming from Brazil to London not from Liverpool or Scotland plus we have to go through Paris. The airports in Rio are shuttling down so I don't know if I can get out of the country. Additional to that I live 2 to 3 hours from the international airport in Rio. I'm a high risk because of age and past health issues traveling on the tube would be a fatal mistake. I requested a credit in lieu of cancellation fee. Booking.com transmitted the information which management accepted but require a rebooking date right away. I was assured that no additional charge would be required until checkin, however, the hotel promptly charged me for the July 1st rate which about 100 pounds higher than my April 1st reservation. Booking.com was of some assistance but very little. They offered no help in mitigation of my situation and I had to suggest a recommendation which the hotel manager agreed to. I looked for ibis hotel policy on refunds during this crisis but couldn't find one! That's when I realized I was in trouble. All in all I would choose to lose the money rather than put my family at risk."
1067. You made a reservation for a 30 day stay ?What do your travel insurers say?
"I wish to cancel my hotel reservations because of the global COVID19 pandemic on the advice of my family doctor, Canadian Federal Health Authorities and the health authorizes in the Netherlands. I am 75 years of age which makes me more susceptible to catching the virus.Confirmation number: 3199.406.524"
"Ian H,This is not booking,com. This is just a travellers forum on Tripadvisor website so nobody here is associated with Booking,com.You need to get onto the Booking,com website and manage your booking on there, or did you get an email after you booked? There might be a link to click in that email. Or contact the hotel directly to discuss cancelling. If it was a non-refundable deal you booked then it’s up to the hotel whether they refund you in the current crisis, or they may say it’s still no refund."
Hi IanI am afraid this is not booking.com and as far as I know there is no booking.com representative who monitors this forum.You should look over the booking conditions of your reservation and if a flexible and refundable rate plan then you should be able to go onto the My Account section of www.booking.com and look to cancel your booking from there.If you however booked a non-refundable rate you may have to consider making a claim on your travel insurance. There is no automatic right to get a refund on a non-refundable rate.
I'm having the same problem because of Coronavirus and travel ban to Spain. Neither the hotel nor Hotels.com are helpful. I filed a credit card dispute with Hotels.com and it was denied because hotel.com said I received the service..not true. Tomorrow I will try another dispute claim and I will write both the hotel and hotels.com a personal letter. If no luck I'm cancelling my account with them. It's one thing being a nonrefundable charge but this travel ban and virus is another thing. Nicholas
"nick, this topic is about Booking,com. You mention Hotels.com so is there a reason you posted the same thing twice on this topic rather than on one of the Hotels.com topics? Booking,com and Hotels.com have no business connection."
having had to cancel my booking with the commadore hotel in notting for the 6 of april because of the covid 19 as flights were canceled and travel restrictions being put in place in ireland.althrough it was booked as non refundable under the cercumstances as through no fault of mine .it would be good practice for the hotel to refund the fee or are they just out to make of the covid epidemic.which being on your site dosenot look good on you please do not come back with your normal reply it warrents more explnation.thank you.

Did you go to the link I posted? How much easier can they make it?
"Apologies, I never saw your link - thank you so much. I had been on the website again this morning and never saw that. I will have a look at it now"
"If you never use Booking.com again, that's entirely up to you. I can't help thinking it's an over-reaction, though. It's always down to the accommodation as to whether they choose to enforce T&C's on things like non refundable bookings or not.All BDC can do, and I've read here that they have done exactly this, is to urge hotels and rental owners to refund in these circumstances."
"Can you claim on your credit card for a non refundable bookingEdited: 3:15 pm, April 07, 2020 "
1082. More information is needed.
If you paid by credit card for a non refundable cancellation booking can you claim on your credit card as you would for your flight being cancelled or your holiday company going bankrupt
A non refundable booking usually means non refundable.However if this is a booking that you can't use because of covid19. BDC is advising accommodation providers to refund.
>>>If you paid by credit card for a non refundable cancellation booking can you claim on your credit card as you would for your flight being cancelled or your holiday company going bankrupt<<<The situation isn’t alike - unless your hotel cancels the reservation. So technically no.Suggest you contact the hotel directly
What do you do if the hotel is closed due to the virus? I have booked non-refundable through Expedia for end o May when hotels are not operating
"I'd ask Expedia what their position is first off. Maybe you will be allowed to change your dates or get a credit for a future booking.Where is the hotel, by the way? Is it certain that it won't be open?"
"I heard somebody has the same problem with booking in Belgium (end May) and our friends have reservation in Germany (Bavaria) beginning of June. Belgium hotel is closed, whilst Germany clearly states hotels are not allowed to accommodate tourists, thus in respect of non-German residents the hotel is closed. This fact was highlighted to both Booking.com and hotels. Booking.com simply continues to allow this fraudulent advertisement, whilst hotels ignore customers of non-refundable. Best way to contact credit card provider afterwards and collects all facts beforehand to dispute the charge.Edited: 1:22 pm, April 21, 2020 "
">>> Belgium hotel is closed, whilst Germany clearly states hotels are not allowed to accommodate tourists, thus in respect of non-German residents the hotel is closed. This fact was highlighted to both Booking.com and hotels. Booking.com simply continues to allow this fraudulent advertisement<<<Fraudulent advertisement? How exactly do you propose Booking.com to close advertising to non-German residents, and keep it open to German locals? At the same time allow reservation for far future dates?Edited: 1:48 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"Booking.com was GREAT. I had a non-refundable reservation for an England Hotel in early May. The Hotel announced they were closed for a period including the time of my reservation. Note I had another non-refundable reservation but that Hotel on its own advised me they were closing for a period and offered my a refund.I asked them for a refund - they said they had no $ for doing so,I went to Booking,com, They said I could cancel given the above circumstances and they would follow-up with the Hotel and if the Hotel did not provide a refund then Booking,com would do so.Which is what happened. Booking.com refunded the $ around 400 GBP."

"Navigator/Owen in posting #1092,I don’t think the hotel would have referred you here to all of us travellers on this public TripAdvisor travel forum. I think they would have suggested you contact Booking,com directly. Booking,com website is where you need to go."
I paid for the booking they took it off my card they where very rude to me because there was a lot of gang people there selling drugs I told them I wanted my money returned because I would rather pay 100. Then deal with that scum
Who was rude to you? The hotel? Booking.com? The drug sellers?

Brian. This is not BDC. You've posted on the Trip Advisor forums. We can't cancel your reservation.
"Hi All,Agree really difficult to cancel anything through bookings.com Their on line process is so frustrating and leave no further option once you have exhausted all the possible solutions whilst continuously suggesting the same solution that does not solve your problem.I made a non refundable booking which was prepaid, the Hotel cancelled the booking due to CoVId 19 closure and national lock down. After numerous mails to Bookings and some discussions with the Hotel i was informed that my entire booking will be refunded within 10 to 15 business days by bookings.com as the Hotel had never received the funds even though it was about two weeks since i made and paid for the booking.To date i have still not received my refund and am unable to contact them telephonically, to further my query. Bookings.com is a fair weather company that works well when everything go as planned, their after sales service to deal with issues outside the norm is appalling to say the least .I would not recommend them, in future i will just deal on line with the Hotel direct reservations, at least i can call and actually speak to a person to explain my situation, get a logical and reasonable response and escalate the matter further should it be required."
"II purchased 3 return flights from Toronto Canada to Faro Portugal Feb29th/2020 returning Faro to Toronto March 31/2020 through FlightHub , Due to the Corona virus TAP cancelled our return flight . I received no notice from either TAP Airline or Flight Hub even though they had my e mail. I tried to reach them by phone and on line to no avail . ( A friend also flying same flight informed me of cancellation.) We ended up rebooking a flight with BA to get home and deal with this from here. Still not resolved any suggestions?"

I have done that several times and Booking.com have always helped out.
"Sally, it's good to hear that BDc have helped out, But with what?"
"Due to Codiv 19 I can not travel to the Hotel in Germany. I have contacted the Hotel and they are Ok to cancel no problem, but Bookings.com used Agoda.com to make the booking.I contacted Agoda that has cancelled the booking and they told me to contact Bookings.com for a refund!Bookings.com claim that it is a nonrefundable booking and want to keep the money!They can not fulfil the contract but won't refund"
By the way I made a second reservation using Hotels.com because I needed two invoices and Hotels.com reimbursed me within 72 hours back in March
"Lucky you, I have been trying for two months, ever since the Codiv 19 lockdown started the hotel is closed and Bookings.com just keeps telling me that it's non-refundable! The hotel has confirmed the cancellation and informed me that they will not be paid for it, so I guess someone wants to keep the money all £150.Maybe Bookings.com is in financial difficulty, I mean £150, I give more than that to charity on a good day."

"608douglas, was your card charged by Booking.com or the hotel?"
"Bookings, they have just informed me that they are going to refund me then 20 mins later they sent another email which said they would not refund a non-refundable booking.I'm waiting to see if my credit card gets the refund when I clicked on the link in the email that stated that they were going to refund it stated that the booking was cancelled so I'm guessing it is."
Shall I assume that you were charged by Booking.com?
"I think that there is a general misunderstanding about how making a reservation through an OTA (Booking.con, Expedia etc)The OTA acts as a booking agent (like a travel agent without actually doing any legwork other than listing properties). They then charge 15-22% in commission on the TOTAL of EVERY booking. So if you have booked through one of these companies then the place that you will be staying has already lost a large chunk of the amount.The system used by the OTAs is pretty inflexible to the properties listed as they cannot even update a lot of their details without it being approved first - even if the information is incorrect (I personally have had this and it has take 3 years to resolve).The properties are not able to make changes or cancel a booking without being charged to do so.If you make a NON-REFUNDABLE booking, this means that the property has created a special lower than usual rate (then you have to take off the commission as well as expenses)....by now you should begin to see that the profit margin is drastically reducing! The big OTAs spend their time convincing property owners that they need to do this in order to be competitive. On top of all this they then try and get you to sign up for a loyalty programme (eg. Genius), at this point the property has to incur a further 10% discount and want free early/late check in plus any other benefit they can squeeze out of you.Just to finish us off, they then try to take the payment online for you, this incurs a charge somewhere bewteen 1.5 and 2.5% plus the usual charge from the property payment system of around 1.5%.Are you adding this up?? So for a 100€ room, less all of the above a property may be lucky if they see 20€ from your booking.To top it all, the property then has to deal with the call from disgruntled customers who want to cancel a non-refundable booking the day before arrival when they have little or no chance of reselling the room.So please if you don't think that it is the likes of Booking.com to deal with your query then please think again, the property owners pay them a lot of money to just pass the buck.#bookdirect - if you want the best rates, better T&Cs, more chance of an upgrade and better service please please please BOOK DIRECT. Oh and don't book a non-refundable rate unless you 100% will make it (personally I only book them if I am enroute to the place or in the same town last minute), have good travel insurance to cover it or just don't care and can afford to loose the money!!!And just to finish off...one thing that I really do not understand is why on earth you book through one of these companies and then immediately contact directly with questions....(ok so sometimes we don't actually receive your questions through the OTA system!) but why not just go direct in the first place?* to the original poster about making a mistake booking, I am sorry that sucks, if you made a mistake and contacted them straight away then they should have at lest amended the booking.Edited: 4:59 pm, July 17, 2020 "
#17'bookdirect - if you want the best rates'Sadly not......I just booked a Best Western hotel for next week in Solihull.....£34 with free cancellation on Booking.com....£45.00 for the same thing booking direct.There is some truth in what you say.....but much is also not accurate....especially as things affect the customer.....I almost always use BDC....and I travel the world...and need reliabiluty and price.
"Nat, I'm always pleased to see contributions from accommodation owners and managers as it provides a different kind of perspective to the views of travellers like myself.That being said, I have always felt that the business decisions that are made by hotels, and the agreements they have in place with sites like Booking.com, are a matter for them.To be perfectly clear, I don't care what commission a property will pay. What I do care about is the quality of the accommodation, the facilities provided, whether the service levels are good and consistent, plus whether I think the price is good value or not.As I see it, no accommodation provider is forced to do anything. There is always the option of saying no to something you don't like. Would it be wise to do so? Possibly not, but that's just one of the difficult decisions involved in running any business. Another one is setting policies that work, and having to enforce those policies when circumstances require it.I think KVE makes a good pint in enquiring whether you should stay in the industry. If you don't mind me saying so, your seem tired, cheesed off and ready to blame anyone and everyone else for whatever troubles you're having. If you are going to continue, then you need to focus on an effective business plan and not be so easily swayed by what booking sites tell you. Say no to things like 'Genius' and non refundable rates if you want to. That's your choice."
My husband went to book 1xroom at the Quality Inn and for some reason we were charged for 3 rooms! They refuse to refund us our money. We called them within minutes of the booking and they said there is nothing they can do and will not refund us our money. There has to be something that can becdone
">>> My husband went to book 1xroom at the Quality Inn and for some reason we were charged for 3 rooms! They refuse to refund us our money<<<By any chance that one room was for three (3) people? It’s a common mistake. The system doesn’t make such errors, so I would double check that against your confirmation first.>>>We called them within minutes of the booking and they said there is nothing they can do and will not refund us our money<<<Who did you call? Booking.com or the hotel? On a non refundable reservation, there is nothing Booking.com are authorised to do, any discretion HAS to come from the hotel themselves. >>>There has to be something that can be done<<<Beyond contacting the hotel and pleading your case, there is little else you can do. Regardless, and whatever the decision, it is entirely up to the hotel - not Booking.comEdited: 5:20 am, July 24, 2020 "
"I accidentally booked a room for 2 nights and only needed 1night, it didn’t say non refundable, but this the only way I can get in touch , of you don’t mind could you refund the second night, please and thank you"
"Omeka Foster,This is a public chat travel forum on TripAdvisor website. This is NOT a way to get in touch with Booking.com or the hotel you booked. We are travellers like you so we don’t work for Booking,com.I suggest you look on the confirmation email you received after you booked and is there a link in there to manage your booking, or get onto the Booking,com website or APP and deal with it in there."
1120. This isn't booking.com. There should be a link on your confirmation email that will enable you to manage your booking.
"Even if you were communicating with the hotel, Omeka, I don't think you have provided enough information for them to be able to identify you or our booking."
We made a booking which at the time we knew was not refundable. This was to attend a family 50th wedding anniversary. This event was cancelled because of Covid so we have had no choice but to cancel. I thought that under these circumstances an exception could be made
#1124Probably best to factor in paying a small amount more for some piece of mind that you can cancel and be refunded for future bookings should you have to change plans.Booking Non-Refundable rates always carries a degree of risk vs. saving on the rate.
“This event was cancelled because of Covid so we have had no choice but to cancel.“In what way did you have no choice? If the hotel was still open and available what was preventing you from using it?
"I can see what Jeanette is saying. Either the function was cancelled because of the lockdown restrictions, or, maybe less likely, the family decided that in the circumstances the function shouldn't go ahead even though it was allowed.Either way, though, if the hotel was open then their point of view would be that the reason for not coming is irrelevant and they will enforce the terms of the contract.Jeanette is right if this all occurred during a time that the hotel was not open. In that case, the hotel is unable to provide what was booked and they should, at a minimum, offer a credit or a change of date.In either scenario, the decision to refund or not is down to the hotel, not Booking.com."
I book dated July 25 But the booking not accepted due to Covid 19 Protocol that is why we message again and ahain the Agoda Customer Assistance but no reply asking for the cancelation and refund until now
"I'm sorry I missed this earlier, but this is a Booking.com discussion, bhe. You need to find an Agoda thread if you want to talk about that company."
"What is your ""ethics"" judgment on canceling the credit card if:1) The reason for cancelling the hotel reservation is that the government (Iceland) won't allow U.S. tourists into the country because of Covid-19.2) A polite written request for waiver of cancellation fees was made both through Booking.com (who is supportive), and then directly to the hotel, but the hotel has not responded to either request (more than a week has past).3) The request for waiver of fees was made a month in advance of the reservation arrival date, and the hotel has not charged the card yet, so there is nothing to refund."
"1130 PhillipIf the booking was non refundable then that is exactly what it is....most hotels on BDC give two booking options, the more expensive one allows free cancellation....would seem you chose the cheaper option....but wanted the benefits of the premium option."
"Philip,The hotel itself sets the cancellation policies so it’s their decision whether to be flexible, understanding and waive any cancellation fee you agreed to when booking. Either the hotel staff/management are busy and have not yet responded to you, or they are ignoring your polite written requests.What exactly was the agreement/policy? Was it a Pay at the Hotel deal with specific conditions that you would forfeit 1 night if you cancelled, or what??I don’t like the idea of agreeing to something, but when something happens you want to cancel your credit card to get out of paying it. Unless I am misunderstanding your intention."
">>>What is your ""ethics"" judgment on canceling the credit card if:<<<I'll start by saying something you probably already know; cancelling the credit card doesn't cancel the debt.But regardless of that and the legal situation, I don't like it.>>>1) The reason for cancelling the hotel reservation is that the government (Iceland) won't allow U.S. tourists into the country because of Covid-19.<<<Not being allowed entry is always a possibility for various reasons. It could be war, it could be incorrect documentation, a natural disaster or a travel ban because of a global pandemic. It's not down to the hotel. If they are open, it's not their fault that you can't avail yourself of what you booked. Why punish them for the decision you made, although I accept you made that decision not expecting anything like this.>>>2) A polite written request for waiver of cancellation fees was made both through Booking.com (who is supportive), and then directly to the hotel, but the hotel has not responded to either request (more than a week has past).<<<Politeness doesn't guarantee a positive response, it only helps. The hotel should have the courtesy to reply, but the lack of a response doesn't, to my mind, justify what you're thinking of doing. >>>3) The request for waiver of fees was made a month in advance of the reservation arrival date, and the hotel has not charged the card yet, so there is nothing to refund.<<<Perhaps this is what you're basing your hopes on! But the fact that they have not yet charged doesn't invalidate the contract, nor doe sit make it a more savoury act for you to cancel your card and hope that the hotel doesn't bother to try and collect on the debt.The moral thing to do is to take responsibility for choosing a non refundable rate, accept that the hotel is entitled to the money, and let them have it with good grace if they do charge you. At the moment, it looks as if no one knows if they will or not."
"Hello everyone!I have a situation with my booking, that I made it totally accidentally, because it was my first minutes on booking.com and I just typed some random data and clicked. Just to see how it all works... but I made a non-refundable booking. Anyway this place accept only cash and I canceled this immidietly and I see""Your total reservation price is € 0. You can see the details of the total price in the booking confirmation in the app, on the website or in your email.""But when I enter this e-mail I see""Cancellation Fee TermsTotal cancellation fee: € 21.6""Neither hotel nor booking.com responded me still.Should I worry? What can I do to make myself not be charged?Thank you for fast respond in advance, I'm really stressed :/"
"Don't worry, Jank. The most you appear to be in danger of losing is €21.60. That seems not too bad to me as a learning fee or warning on not messing around on unfamiliar website by inputting a load of stuff randomly.I wouldn't be stressed about the money, because you may not be charged anything at all, but I'd be pretty annoyed at myself."
"I'm annoyedAnd I was sure I was checking it out at refundable one...I was a little pissed off, but finally booking.com contacted them and I was free of any charge.Thankfully"
That's good to hear. Booking.com appear to have helped you out this time. But you can't rely on that all the time.
