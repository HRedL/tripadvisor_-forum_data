"We are due to travel from London to Japan on the 27th of March - 13th April (unless our flight gets cancelled). We are planning to stay in Tokyo and Kyoto and also do some day trips to Mt Fuji, Kamakura etc. Can anyone living there or someone there on holiday at the moment tell me what the current vibe is? Is it even worth going? Do people not want tourists to come with the current risk of spreading the virus?We are personally not that bothered about many museums being closed but it would feel like a real waste to go all the way to Japan and not be able to visit temples, Nara park, shops, viewing points, restaurants and so on. I’d really appreciate any comments or suggestions! Thanks"
Temples and shrines are still open in Kyōto. The night “light up” events called “Hanatoro” were cancelled this spring. But 2 temples are still open in the evening right now for their “”light up” openings. Kodaiji Temple and Entokuin are still open. I saw my friend’s pics and videos from last night. I was surprised to see Teramachi Shotengai/ Shopping Arcade mobbed with people on Sunday afternoon. I thought maybe things were getting better but then I read a news article forwarded to me from a friend reporting that Nagoya hospitals don’t have room for corona patients. So maybe you shouldn’t go to Nagoya if it’s on your itinerary for some reason.

"Given the way in which the UK is approaching this matter, I'm going to suggest there is a good chance Japan closes its borders to those from the UK and probably Europe. Canada thankfully did yesterday and despite or lower numbers, close all bars and restaurants in Ontario and likely others will follow."
"Shot, I think it could be pretty easy to send or find away to help Canadians. I had not heard about specific amounts but I suspect there will be assistance. I know there is promised support to help people return home from abroad. Moat people in my former industry can work from home. I have worked on BCP plans and they have contemplated this since SARS. It will be crappy for my daughter to stay home for weeks. And I'll get board and it will be a strain for sure. But some financial decisions we made years ago, although not the norm, certainly lessen the impact. It is pretty lucky for us to have no debt and no mortgage. Even though in in between jobs and had one lined up and put on hold this week, it will be fine for a while. I do empathize with many not in this position. The Canadian govt has made it immediately easier to get unemployment benefits so that's a start and local officials are trying to already think about how they will improve things once the worst is over. I live in the centre of yyz and it is a ghost town. Even quite than it normally is on weekends. Very quiet too.

"Went to Haneda airport at 1 pm today. It was deserted, except for the people who work there and construction workers (building new airport hotel + reconstructing the roads leading to the airport). They might have been there for lunch. The board said only FIVE planes were arriving between noon and 3 pm. From Taipei (2 flights), Frankfurt, Manila, San Francisco and Paris. China Airline, Lufthansa, Philippine, United, ANA and JAL. ALL the other flights had a big ""CANCELLED"" next to them. The airline industry is surely going to see a lot of layoffs and bankruptcies.

"Sooo... I drove to downtown Tokyo today. (Had paperwork that needed face-to-face. Bureaucracy!) Kindly excuse the rant. Shibuya, Roppongi, Hibiya, Shiba-Koen, Ginza, around the moat of the Imperial Palace, Hanzomon, Yotsuya, Shinjuku, Yoyogi-koen..... YOU would never BELIEVE we are in the middle of a CRISIS!! Hello, Japan? Are you listening? Reading? Watching what is happening in Europe and America???? Traffic is HORRENDOUS! Yeah, no one's riding the trains. Need to keep our distance from others. So....they're all in their cars, carrying on business as usual! And yes, it was a beautiful day and cherry blossoms are starting to bloom........ so EVERYONE AND THEIR BEST FRIENDS are ALLLLLLLLLL out, walking along the streets, eating at restaurants, shopping, working at the office, yada yada. Are my family and many of my friends the only ones trying to stay in ""social distancing"" mode???? And WHY are there people HAVING PICNICS under the cherry trees near Zojiji Temple? And a guy driving a Maserati in Ginza. In Ginza??? Thousands of people in Shinjuku! Where did they come from? Where are they going? What the heck is going on?????No wonder the GOVERNMENT won't have a lock down! A. Business as usual is good for the economy. B. They want the Olympics, so business needs to LOOK normal. (If the Olympics is cancelled, Japan will lose $50 BILLION.)C. They're stopping people from coming into the country, so COVID-19 won't come. D. There's no crisis. It's cherry blossom season! And it's a 3-day weekend from tomorrow! Color me dumbfounded. Nevertheless, happy cherry blossom time! Kanpai!"
"Denial is catchy. I was actually pricing hotels in Nagoya two days ago and my friends said “you realize that they’re turning corona patients away from hospitals there, right?”Everyone is out and about. People don’t seem to be worried about anything here."
"Well corona patients don't necessarily have to be in hospitals and majority of them are not...but let's hope most of them aren't arseh*les like that one guy who purposely went outside to spread the virus after being tested positive.But yeah, pretty much the only people doing social distancing in this country is the hikikomoris :,)"
"Well, Koumeun_baram, that guy in his 50s you mentioned died of pneumonia caused by COVID 19 because his immune system was weaken from liver cancer.The problem here is the doctors are getting infected and keep on practing and spreading it to the patients and the staff. I wonder if the doctor, having a fever and coughs, couldn't doubt his having the virus for such a long time like seven days."
"Mamajelli, come on you're exaggerating too much.""No one's riding the trains.""--That is far from true.The trains were crowded. One thing I noticed is that the subways have their windows opened a little bit to keep fresh air coming in. Even so, when a woman sitting next to me coughed and after that she closed her eyes looking so tired, I gave up my seat. It's still scary, not knowing if she has COVID-19 or not. And it's a weekday, the roads will be always crowded in Tokyo."
"Nah, Global, not exaggerating. I can SIT on any train. Chuo line, Yurakucho, Hibiya, Hanzomon, Odakyu, Yamanote... whatever.... during the day. That's never happened before! Except maybe after 3/11. I haven't seen roads that crowded since the Bubble! Of course, it's the day before a 3-day weekend, but non-rush hour? Pretty crazy."
"Give me a break. ”No one” means literally zero people. (>_<) If you saw nobody else on the train, I will say you're not carrying too far. 　The roads are busy in the city center. I don't know about the suburbs.I thought the trains would be less crowded but Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line was more crowded than I thought it would be.Edited: 9:01 am, March 19, 2020 "
I was supposed to meet friends for dinner tonight in a “quiet” area of Kyōto and EVERY place we tried had lines outside or were just full!? We gave up. We had hoped to find a quiet place with few people. It’s truly the start of a 3-day weekend here in Kyōto.
"Well, if you put all the kids out of school, they hang out together, go shopping and do what kids do. I also see many of the schools in my area open for ""care"" - giving them a place to go during the day (again, playing together in groups), and some schools are still open/operating.As for other people during the day, maybe the number of people at my local station is slightly less, but it's always busy and still lots of people travelling by train. Life continues much as normal for many people. I'll be doing a trip into Shinjuku next week - again, somethings need to be done in person, and I expect it will be quieter than usual, but not quiet."
"I work at a hotel in a ski resort and we are full...it's been like that every weekend. Japanese guests always show up to go skiing. In my home country after they told people to stay at home but they went skiing anyway, they just shut down all ski resorts...that's definitely not gonna happen here."
Here's an interesting article. https:/…
"Remember that Japan is under testing:https:/…coronavirus-testing-source-dataJapan: 16,484Italy: 148,657S.Korea: 286,716All as of March 17."
"I think most people understand Japan is not testing many/any people and actively avoiding it in cases. There is a ""however"" - even if the actual number of cases was much higher (say 10 times more), then there should be a higher number of associated covid-19 deaths. While they might be listed/classified incorrectly as cause of death, it is pretty hard to disguise a rapidly growing number of deaths among the population. Maybe it is there, maybe it is coming .Anyway, it is a nice spring weekend, local baseball teams are commencing practice, people are enjoying the sakura and trips to the park and it is pretty relaxed in the area I live."
">>There is a ""however"" - even if the actual number of cases was much higher (say 10 times more), then there should be a higher number of associated covid-19 deaths. While they might be listed/classified incorrectly as cause of death, it is pretty hard to disguise a rapidly growing number of deaths among the population. <<<Well, pneumonia is #3 cause of death among older Japanese. Annually, about 120,000 people die from pneumonia in Japan. That's 329 death per day. Do you think they all get tested before or after they die?"
"It's just a miracle that Japan is keeping the number of COVID-19 positive patients so small in a society with a very high population density. Maybe keeping everything clean and people wearing masks really prevent the virus from spreading. Somehow, I can't buy the theory.."
"Tokyo, Chiba, Osaka and Hyogo are inching up. :-( Today is the 3rd day of a 3-day weekend. The highways are quite congested. All those people went SOMEWHERE and are going back home. A friend that went to look at cherry blossoms at Chidorigafuchi said it was much more crowded than she had expected. We'll ""see"" what happens in 2 weeks......"
"I think the decision of Japanese Government of doing the testing in only limited places was good. If they had allowed testing in most hospitals, people would have rushed to hospitals, which could have been the places to transfer the virus. I also think the number of patients are smaller in Japan than many other countries from the number of deaths. I think some of our life styles, such as not shaking hands, not hugging each other, and just bowing, must be good. Japanese also have high attention for hygiene issues. For example, ""The Plague(Pest in Germany)"" written by Albert Camus and published in 1947 is now the No.1 bestseller book in Japan. Although viral infection is, of corse, different from bacterial infection, they say there are many similarities in the society to when the Plague was pandemic and many Japanese are trying to learn something from it."
">>>Well, pneumonia is #3 cause of death among older Japanese. Annually, about 120,000 people die from pneumonia in Japan. That's 329 death per day. Do you think they all get tested before or after they die?<<<I don't think they will get tested at all. But if you did add an extra 300 deaths/day added to the usual tally, then it would show up. Italy, unfortunately, has more than 600/day at the moment and that is very obvious. According to some statistics I was checking on this, old age appears to have taken over the #3 spot according to data from the Health Ministry."
"Not all dying of pneumonia are tested but I remember the Sagamihara lady in her 80s was reported to be tested after she died in January and there was another case reported to be tested after the patient's death. These days the media is giving less information of each case but some prefectures tell the deceased had already tested positive or not.Edited: 1:02 am, March 23, 2020 "
"In practical terms, Japan seems to be using the ""herd immunity"" strategy. Therefore, testing is not a priority."
"Other good Japanese habits probably helping with keeping virus spread down are always taking shoes off in house, not spitting, not blowing noses in public and considering of others not sneezing in public.Some other countries people spit a lot, don’t bother covering when sneezing and not mindful of others around them.Onsens don’t seem to be causing a problem unless people are staying away or the water temperature is hot enough to kill virus."
"#25 I've had mixed experiences with crowds in Tokyo. On Thursday I was at Yasukuni Shrine at mid-day and surprised by how few people were visiting the site.On the other hand, there were a LOT of people in Shinjuku yesterday, including movie in theatres.You might want to check out my first hand report of the Spring Equinox Long Weekend in Tokyo in this thread https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29423…"
"It seems that the number of death due to pneumonia is not increasing in Japan, so the situation is very different from Europe and the U.S.A. I think what are written in the article shown by mamajelli, as follows, are true. https:/…Especially, the Japanese culture with no handshakes and hugs, frequent hand-washing and masks has prevented rapid spreading of the infection, unlike in other countries."
">>But if you did add an extra 300 deaths/day added to the usual tally, then it would show up. Italy, unfortunately, has more than 600/day at the moment and that is very obvious.<<329 is the average per day number of patients that die from regular pneumonia. If that number goes up to 500 in the nation of 126 million and hundreds of hospitals, nobody would notice. >>>It seems that the number of death due to pneumonia is not increasing in Japan<<You would not know the statistics until next year at the latest."
"#30Yes, based on extensive personal experience the general level of hygiene in Japan is noteworthy. On the other hand, bad habits such as coughing without covering one's mouth is common practice in Japan, even on crowded trains and other public places.And according to the WHO, at least to date there is no evidence that COVID-19 cannot be transmitted in hot and humid environments. Further, WHO goes on to say specifically that ""Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower."" https:/…myth-busters (accessed 3/24/20) I would be very leery of suggesting to others that temperature is a protection against the virus, since the latest information from the WHO directly contradicts that notion."
"@mabei0123 I posted on other topics before that I would feel safer in Japan during a world pandemic. From my personal observations, Japanese people generally have better hygiene practices, like wearing masks when sick (no one in the US wears masks), tidiness in public spaces, much much cleaner public restrooms (I was so surprised to see how clean public restrooms at busy cities like Tokyo were compared to big cities in US like Los Angeles. In LA, it's honestly cleaner to not wash your hands than to wash your hands in public restrooms). Yes, there are Japanese people who don't cover their mouths when cough or wash their hands after using the restroom, but it's pretty much the same in US, particularly in Los Angeles. I'm constantly dodging people who cough without covering their mouths, way before COVID-19."
"Canadian cities also pale in comparison to Tokyo in all the ways you mention. And, at least in my hometown, it always seem like half the ATMs and two-thirds of the escalators are out of service. Never experienced either in Japan.Must admit, though, I don't recall people not covering their mouths when they cough. Perhaps that's just nostalgic thinking about the homeland...I can't think of a place I'd rather ride out a pandemic either, to be honest."
"#32When Japan is definitely undertesting, it is too early to jump to conclusions. Maybe people living outside Tokyo don't share how freaky it is to find some people coughing it is each time you get on the Tokyo Metro subway. Hanzomon line isn't that crowded but after six in the evening, they are still quite packed.The Expert Panel is warning if we stop measurements to avoid the crowds, explosions of numbers at big cities are to come, The Mayor of Tokyo is warning us about the possibility of Lockdown if that happens."
"There are many patients died from bacterial pneumonia, but patients died from viral pneumonia of unknown cause are generally rare in Japanese hospitals. So, if there is such a patient, we can now check its blood for Covet-19. Also, if the number of those patients double, doctors can be aware of it. Although it was good that the number of infected people was limited in Japan, we still have to be careful for the rapid spreading of the virus, as the mayor of Tokyo had warned.We could check the infection only at limited number of hospitals at initial phase, which was good to prevent people from rushing to hospitals. But, we can now check the infection at any hospitals in Japan. In my hospital, 2 of my patients were hospitalized from other hospital, which is known to have a few patients diagnosed as the Covit-19 infection. Although we isolated those 2 patients, we can now check the Cobvid-19, if we think we should. But, the problem is the treatment, when they are diagnosed. We hope we don't have to see any of those patients."
"The news said also yesterday there was a case that they tested after he died and found out he had COVID-19.About Tokyo, nearly half of the cases are coming from unknown sources, which means it might be widely spread without being detected.By the way, Dr. Abei, it is COVID-19, not Covit nor Covet.It comes from COronaVIrusDisease."

"600 million masks per month - so one mask per person per week. I haven't seen a mask for sale for a couple of months - not that I particularly go searching for them, seems little point given how few there are."
"I thought the masks were being bought out by the government and passed out to medical facilities, elderly/ day care, and places that are ""hot spots."" They were using the postal service to deliver a package of masks to each home somewhere in Hokkaido a couple of weeks ago. Tokyo has had a sudden surge of positive testers. Yesterday. Will the postman deliver a package to our homes? Hmmm. I was talking to my doctor at the local clinic (naika/internal medicine). He said he still has enough for his staff, although he'll be reaching the bottom of the barrel soon. I would hope all hospitals, big and small, will get their supply first! In my neighborhood, there are no masks. Haven't seen them for weeks. Rarely see toilet paper and tissue sitting on a shelf. If and when they come in, people line up to get ONE package straight out of the big carton. A friend traveled to Shizuoka for work and posted a picture of MANY, many packages of toilet paper and tissue on the shelves. Sigh....."
"@Shot,Yes, you are right that we might have to be under lockdown in July. But, we still have @3 months to consider what we should do to prevent the lockdown. Most elderly people are staying at their home, but the key might be what young people will do, who are not at high risk for severe pneumonia but can transmit the virus. They should be under semi-lockdown: more and more companies should allow that and they should also stay home in the weekends."
""". Most elderly people are staying at their home, but the key might be what young people will do, who are not at high risk for severe pneumonia but can transmit the virus."" 53% of the hospitalizations in New York are people from the ages of 18 to 49, so the risk is well beyond them just transmitting it to others. This is severe enough to put them in the hospital. Some young healthy people have died but that is very rare but we really don't know what long term damage is done to the lungs of the people who eventually recover. The governments in the early days went around saying young people won't be significantly impacted but that is not what we have been seeing in France and now in the US. All adults need to consider this a threat to their health in addition to the concern of not wanting to pass it on to people for whom the virus has a higher probability of being fatal.Also, if it is spread through Tokyo already its going to come on way faster than July. You likely have weeks not months. It hit New York like a freight train and that is happening all over europe now. Until Japan does massive testing there is no telling how far it as spread, but when it starts to hit it will spiral fast.Edited: 6:05 pm, March 25, 2020 "
"On another thread I've posted a new first-hand account from Tokyo based on yesterday's adventures in the city, including rush hour on the Yamanote and cherry blossom viewing in Ueno https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29423…#48 Red259 Yes anecdotally I've noted that in popular areas of Tokyo such as Shinjuku in particular the hordes of tourists which until recently have thronged streets and shops, etc. have been replaced by swarms of young people enjoying their newfound, springtime liberation.You probably know already that Tokyo jumped from 17 cases on Tuesday to 41 on Wednesday. Is this the dreaded ""spike"" that precursors the worst-case scenario? Already talk by the governor of a possible lockdown of the city, especially if people don't follow proper coronavirus etiquette..."
"@tokyoaaron02 - I don't need to go into the central city much at the moment, but I found Shinjuku quieter than my local neighbourhood on a random Tuesday afternoon - still a few tourists, but they stood out much more than usual. And, I agree with one of your other comments (another thread), no groups following little flags around.As for the Governor issuing a ""lock-down"" directive for Tokyo, just like Abe found, there is no force behind such a directive - it is just a recommendation. Also, I wonder how effective such a directive would be given the structure of Tokyo; 23 special wards, 36-ish other cities in Tokyo prefecture and the neighbouring prefectures of Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama - she does not have control over all of that."
"#50 Excellent points, JapanCustomTours. Once again, the multiple meanings of ""Tokyo"" can lead to some confusion. I double checked, and KOIKE Yuriko is governor of Tokyo Metropolis (pop. 14 mil.) - but not the Greater Tokyo Area (38 mil.).FWIW, my wife and I have decided to follow the Governor's directive, not just for our own sake but also to exert what little influence we may have to encourage others to do the same.Hopefully I'm over-reacting, but it does feel as if we could be on the verge of an ""overshoot"" of cases in the city (though I'm still not clear on what, exactly an ""overshoot"" is in this case. Exponential growth?)Like yourself, I'm not in the city center as much these days. Whereas Shinjuku used to be one variant of my daily commute, I've probably only passed through... perhaps half a dozen times since the start of the crisis?If I can detect any kind of pattern from my recollections and photos, it seems to me that the street scene in Shinjuku, especially the area between Shinjuku and Seibu Shinjuku Stations, changes rather dramatically as the day goes on. By late afternoon, in addition to a growing stream of commuters, there seem to be more young people flowing towards the Kabukicho entertainment district in particular, very much NOT in school uniform :-). Again, this is based on only a few random stopovers in Shinjuku...I've also noticed more young people in parks and hanging outside arcades and the like, making the most of an early - and extended - spring break. Not blaming them. 'fraid I would have done the same thing in their situation and with permissive parents. I note that in my neighbourhood schools and possibly other community buildings seem to be offering day programs to give young people a place to go. Except for the local hoods who hang out tin the park on my route home..."
Just checked out live webcam feeds of Shibuya and Akihabara. It's slightly less crowded than normal (most likely due to the lack of tourists) but definitely not quiet by any means.
"Yah. Way more than there should be. Oh well, those that think they are different with this do so to their peril."
"#53 SammyFDInteresting! Can I ask where you found the livecams? I'd love to check them out.We've decided to stay in this weekend in recognition of the Governor's request, and the growing seriousness of the situation in Tokyo.But I would be really, really curious to see what's happening in the city this weekend, who is out and about while we're homebound. I'd really like to see what Akiba and Shibuya, and especially Shinjuku, is like during the ""lock down."" Would you mind posting the URLs for the Tokyo webcams?"
Well the Toyko Governor has also asked people from neighbouring prefectures to not visit Tokyo and also made some requests of the mayors of neighbouring cities/prefectures as well. Seems like setting up a task-force could have been done earlier.Locally - the queue for my local supermarket was longer than usual reflecting the articles in the news. Still lots of toilet paper - not sold-out.
"The numbers of infected people are gradually increasing in Tokyo and Japan. I think PM Abe and Governor Koike are thinking about the balance of merits and demerits (economical) of ""Lockdown"". Although it's difficult to determine the criteria of ""Lockdown"", at least it should not be too late, as it was in Italy and Spain."
"Half of the Tokyo cases this week are those from Taiju Hospital, Keio Hospital and nurses of National Cancer Center."
"Well, the Prime Minister cannot even ask his wife to refrain from having parties.Maybe they should start from shutting down Minami, Kabukicho, Roppongi, Ginza.and Yoshiwara:-p It is not easy for the Government to guarantee the people's pay working there like the UK, anyway."
"A popular Japanese comedian, Ken Shimura, have just died from the Covid-19 pneumonia today. The death of popular celebrities like him can probably change the minds of many Japanese people, more than whatever our Prime Minister says."

"The UK Government is paying 80% of employees salaries with a cap on the payments of £2,500 pm, which would mean that those making more than £37,500 would not getting anymore money than someone making that amount. I think that starts in April.The help for the self-employed has the same cap with the additional condition that those making less than 50% of their income from self-employment and those making more than £50,000 pa don't get anything, Nothing is paid to the self employed until June.The lock down is pretty solid in the UK.If you are outside for any reason except shopping for food, exercise once a day or for work that cannot be done at home, you can be issued a fine by a police officer. All shops are closed except those selling necessities (which does not include clothes or shoes) and restaurants are closed except for take away. Schools are closed.I understand that in the States any lock down is very much on a town by town or State by State basis. There will be some payments beyond unemployment payments but I don't think it is clear how or when.The hope is that the peak can be levelled out to stave off a collapse of the National Health System. At least the NHS here means that no one need worry about paying for medical care although for pretty much every thing except emergencies are remaining untreated as long as this is going on."
"In the US - individuals with adjusted gross incomes up to $75,000 a year will be eligible for $1,200. Reduced checks will go out to individuals making up to $99,000 a year (the payment amount falls by $5 for every $100 in income above $75,000). Checks should be going out in late April."

I saw a video about Nara deer yesterday. A Nara local noted that the deer seemed lost without the tourists feeding them crackers. They were wandering around aimlessly. She did note that they won't starve though as they do get fed.The rats in New Orleans are less fortunate though. Reports say they are roaming the French Quarter streets at night. There aren't much scraps available these days.
"Sorry, Shot, I meant £37,500 per year. The £2,500 per month maximum government payout would be 80% of £37,500 per year which equals £35,000 which is 4,678,974.88 yen by my currency converter-334,212,40 yen each month.That, of course is the maximum. Many people will get 80% of much less.For the self employed, not only is the £2,500 per month a maximum payout, but those making over £50,000 net per year (6,684,249.82 yen) will, unlike well paid employees, get nothing at all.The original point of my post was that the Japanese government could help people less likely to have enough savings to survive for a few months without working without paying out huge sums to the usually well paid.£37,500 per year isn't a particularly ""good paying job"" but is, a believe, above average.Edited: 2:46 am, March 31, 2020 "

">>> lots of small enterprises who are already going south because of cash-flow trouble<<<And Government officials think there will be more than 1,000 job losses (this morning's papers). Woeful under-estimate. The Labour Ministry actually came up with 1,021 as their answer!!"
"With bad weather over the last couple of days in Tokyo, things have been quieter, and a bit more subdued based on what I've observed. And more places are volunteering to close at weekends to limit gatherings.Tokyo and Japan in general are reporting more cases, but the number is still low despite the length of time the virus has been in the country.A possibility is that the habit of using masks has helped in japan and other Asian countries - while some ""official"" channels say it doesn't, the advice has been deliberately misleading and without basis. It was nicely summed up when it was said masks don't protect the public, but they do protect health workers - covid-19 doesn't care which one you are. Just a foot-note to the Labour Ministry ""job losses"" number - it seems to be the result of bad reporting. That small 1,021 number are job losses so far (last two months) attributed to covid and the slow-down. It will grow very substantially over the next couple of months."
"How different it is when you're not listening to Japanese media. The number is kept low because they are undertesting. The beds for the infectious are already getting over full in Tokyo already that the Association of Doctors are warning a lot. There is a core hospital near Ueno Station with 106 cases with 5-7 died by hospital infection.There are clusters formed at night clubs at Kabukicho. Not a time to be optimistic at all.Other prefectures are discouraged to travel to Tokyo now. The expert committee warned people getting tired of refraining from going out, started it to take it too easy.: STAY HOME！！Avoid the crowded placees is the message we got."
Of course Japan doesn't test many suspected cases - that is not new and will continue.
The hospitals' capacity of beds are quite limited in a highly aging society like Japan.
">>>The hospitals' capacity of beds are quite limited in a highly aging society like Japan.<<<Yes, that is seems mostly true. My ex-wife got to see that in operation a few years back when she was in ICU and then general ward for two weeks - loads of old people ""waiting"". She was comparatively young at 50+. Still, there are some elderly that deny treatments and prepared to accept illness and death (my ex's mother in law is one of those apparently) and would not occupy a bed.Health economics is an interesting subject - not pleasant, but in the coming times, people will be denied treatment. It happens in other places too."
"There is a chart that you can see about how many beds are available for the infectious disease.https://www.stopcovid19.jp/The message is UNIVERSAL and worldwide: Stay home to save lives.If we are patient, we will overcome."
"97 cases in Tokyo. 30 were from the same hospital. So... that's technically 67. Wait a bit longer. By this weekend, we will see what happend during the 3-day free for all party weekend. Then wait another week to see if staying home and closing shops made a difference. Many stores have decided to close shop this weekend -- through April 12. My guess is the government doesn't want to close everything down. Sweden hasn't. Their numbers are only in Stockholm. Time..... It's a fine line deciding when the right time is."
"Luckily the truth about Japan is getting out there and educated, younger Japanese people are opening their eyes now. SNS posts in Japanese are slamming the ignorant response from the stupid leaders in Japan. It’s refreshing to see the younger generation seeing the truths and calling them out. Unlike the ignorant relics on here."
"Sweden is taking the herd immunity approach. The number of tests done is likely on a much smaller scale. People are still going out and about. It's a risky move though since they aren't using masks. While population density is lower, cities can still see a significant spread beyond hospital capacity.My brother-in-law lives just outside Stockholm with his two kids. He works for the government and he still has to go out into the field with no exception. He is obviously worried. It's likely that Japan hasn't hit the apex yet. One can see the government wanting to save the Olympics initially. Now that the Olympics is out of the way, they want to minimize economic impact. With a large population though, the Swedish strategy is unlikely to work. The disease is so easily transmitted that a breakout will overwhelm capacity."
"The priority is on AVOIDING MEDICAL COLLAPSE in Japan. Tokyo is a city of 13 million and as an aging society the capacity of hospital beds are not enough.If you see the chart below, the prefectures in black means there are more patients than the beds for the infectious diseases.https://www.stopcovid19.jp/In Japan, even the people with mild symptoms need to be hospitalized binded by the laws. BoJo or the younger brother of Cuomo are/were self isolating at their homes, but in Japan that won't happen until we have the laws changed.Now Tokyo is preparing to ask the mild symptoms to stay home or at accomadations that Tokyo Government will borrow.https:/…0006466589"
I don't think the declaration of the State of Emergency means lockdown.
"I read some Japanese news and it sounded like the lockdown isn't going to be nationally enforced. Instead, it gives prefectures the option to *recommend* closures of some facilities deemed not essential. One important note is apparently, no penalties will be imposed if the recommendations aren't followed."
"It's not a ""real"" lockdown like it is in other parts of the world. The National Emergency law states the government can ""seize"" property and buildings to build hospitals. And give Governors more power to do their own thing. But everything else is probably going to be the same as it always has. Supermarkets, drugstores, banks, all modes of transportation will be doing business as usual. Don't panic. Don't hoard. Life will be basically the same. . There's no penalty or fines for going out, being out, etc. But the Governors can ""request"" bars and ""night life"" to close down. From the latest stats, it seems that many people who have tested positive (and don't belong in clusters or hospitals) were going out at night. Bars, clubs, live houses... all are enclosed, crowded and up close."
"Judging by what happened in Hong Kong recently, bars could be dangerous. There are a couple dozen cases here with infections stemming from the same few bars. The infected have included patrons, bar workers, live band players, players' relatives and roommates. Bars are worse than restaurants from a space perspective since more people are crammed into a smaller area."
"That ¥300,000 yen ""per family"" is only for those who fit the criteria. Not going to all families. Each househod gets 2 masks. (Rolling eyes.) Don't ask if there 3 or more people in your family......"
"Governors request bars, clubs, events, etc to close. When they refuse, the prefectural government can open the name to the public. It's virtually an order."
"The National Emergency Law is different from the law in other countries which allow ""lockdown"". There's no penalty or fines even if we don't follow the law. Still, if we are Japanese who are serious and follow what the Government is asking, it will be fine. Thus, it will be a ""Test"" for current Japanese: are we similar to traditional Japanese or do we need a harder law? The numbers of the infected people and the deaths from the infection are now the 23rd and the 22nd, respectively, in the world. If the National Emergency Law failed to decrease the number of infection 2, 3 weeks later, the Government should make a harder law with penalty and fines."
>>>are we similar to traditional Japanese<<<Be careful of the myths and reality of that statement.
"Yesterday, I took a walk to Asakusa. Many Japanese don't need law enforcement. Nakamise Shopping Streets were so deserted that I only saw 20 percent of the stores open."
"We will know in 2, 3 weeks. I still think we are different from Western people. The infection has not been spread out in other Asian countries as well, because of customs in each country. It's not the myths, it's the reality."
"""Self-Restriction"" even without any penalties or fines is asked. But, I believe we still have it, as we had it when new influenza virus was pandemic and only few people got infected in 2009, although Self-Restriction came from Samurai."
"I think BCG has something to do with Japan's lower death rate, though some scientists think some of the Japanese population's death from ""regular pneumonia"" is actually from COVID 19. As you know, virtually every Japanese get BCG. And this theory makes more sense than the Japanese being ""different"" from the rest:https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/arti…"
"Well, the death toll of COVID-19 looks similar to that of the obesity rate.https:/…Obesity-Update-2017.pdfEdited: 5:28 am, April 08, 2020 "
"Governor Koike will broadcast something in English every Friday evening. This is from yesterday, April 10. https://www.youtube.com/watch…"
"To sum up, stay home to save lives."
