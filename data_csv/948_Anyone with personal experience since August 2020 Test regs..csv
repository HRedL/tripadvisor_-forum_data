"My wife and I are headed to Tanzania, leaving August 19, 2020. One of the new regulations calls for tests within 72 hours of travel. The problem we are experiencing is that tests take 4-5 days for you to receive results, so if I were to take a test 70 hours (3 days) ahead of time, I would not have results prior to landing in Tanzania. I cannot figure out logistics of 72 hours prior to flight tests must be taken. Is there anyone out there with experience? What was it like landing in Tanzania (we will land in KJO). My Dr. stated that we should take tests 9 days ahead of time so we are assured to have completed tests with negative results, but as she said this is a new event/crisis/regulations for everyone. Anyone have suggestions? Option 1 taking nasal swab 1 week ahead of time, having clear negative results that are 72 hours new, then flying. Option 2, taking 4-5 day results at 70 hours head of time, results will not be available for border crossing, but I will have a doctor's note with notice of the test administration. Option 3-Instant test in 15 min test, very hard to get and an exception needs to be made, this not as widely accepted as other testing measures (also requires 7 hrs drive time). Anyone with recent experience I am hoping for feedback!Thank you all for responses!"

Try Passport Health. They told me they can get within 72 hours:https://www.passporthealthusa.com/
"Unfortunately planethealth is not available in my region. From reading posts online I am finding that people with recent results are fine, even if those results are from tests taken outside of 72 hours, can anyone confirm this?"
"I messaged PlanetHealth and this was their response. “ We do not carry the PCR test, we only have the covid-19 antibody test during this time.”"
