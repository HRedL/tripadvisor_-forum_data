"Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this itinerary to any other people. If it suits you, that's great, but I don't understand how it will ""help others""?For those ""others"", my main concerns: 1. too much time in Fairbanks for the activities mentioned2. the drive from Denali to Seward in a single day (8 to 10 hrs without stops)3. taking the Salmonberry tour when you drove by all those places two days previously and could have stopped on your own and spent as little or as much time at each stop as YOU wanted to4. driving Anchorage to Fairbanks in a single day (7 or more hrs. without stops)."
"I love some of your activities but you are backtracking, are doing two long drives that could backfire with construction, accidents, etc. Are any aspects off your trip changeable? No need to give suggestions if everything is set in stone.Who is traveling?Edited: 2:22 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"Thank you all. We are Indeed backtracking back to Fairbanks at the end. That saves us over $1,000 on the rental car however by getting and then returning the car in Fairbanks. Yes relaxing pace in Fairbanks but we felt a long trip so don’t push, rest some, early on, and even get work done in Fairbanks Via Zoom. Travel times longer than we thought I see, not a huge deal, leave earlier, allow for road stops. Re Salmon Berry tour we felt better to have a pro take us around rather than wander place to place ourselves even though driving by them. Graduation trip for our 18 year old with his two not so young parents."
"I would skip anything to do with Wedgewood -the wildlife sanctuary and the auto museum and spend the time at the Creamers Field. The Museum of the North in Fairbanks is great-especially if it is raining. If you've got a car and have time, walking the boardwalk at Potter's Field in Anchorage can be interesting. Consider renting bikes to explore the Tony Knowles Trail. You really are Fairbanks heavy. It is a small city and Alaska is a very big state. I don't like jam packed days and one night sleep overs but you might do some minimal rearranging and add a night in Denali."
"Thanks for the added info! That helps. I like the easy pace, and will add more suggestions on Fairbanks fun, to do with your son! Out the door now, but will be back. We hang out with our 30-ish kids there all the time, cause our daughter moved to my hometown a few years ago. I love that town so much. Not everyone does, and some of my thoughts may appeal. And the best thing about what we do there is most isn’t an appointment type deal! Your own pace. And good spots we all love! Deb."
"- is there a place near Denali to get a COvid test?- I wouldn’t drive from Denali to Seward in one day, especially if somehow the COvid testing near Denali feasible. If the 17yr old is at all fit, I’d definitely check out possible glacier activities at/on the Matanudka Glacier. If not fit the basic 3hr hike offered by MICA is still terrific."
"Days 12, 13, 14...I wouldn’t spend them in ANC, I’d find accommodations in Girdwood and focus on activities in the Girdwood/Portage/Whittier area."
Healy is currently offering COVID testing near our community center on Monday & Wednesday from 10-noon. :)
Thanks for the Creamer recommendation and the Kenai Fjords tour. We were going to stay 3 nights in Anchorage but will now plan on a night each in Whittier and Seward.
I would stay in Girdwood not Whittier. I would plan on 2 nights in Seward especially if you are doing a KF tour.
"For day 13, you'll go by all those places on your drive back from Seward,  no need to do a tour,  pretty easy to do on your own, just saying.  Better to spend the night in Girdwood, you'll be on the Turnagain Arm plus it'll be way more pleasant over staying in Anchorage,  very easy and shorter trip to take the train from Girdwood to Whittier the next day Probably be best to both from Girdwood anyway.Consider taking a day from Anchorage, like Day 15 and use it for the  Anchorage to Fairbanks drive via Glacier View and Paxson,  mix it up some,  spend the night in Glennallen or the Paxson area. Very nice scenic dive and saves you backtracking on the same road from Anchorage to Fairbanks via Denali which, IMO, is a very average scenic route, for Alaska that is."
Interesting creative suggestions. Thank you. Could stay in Glen Allen last day and then maybe do three hour Ice Trek Mantanuska Glacier hike.
Deb as you mentioned earlier any additional Fairbanks suggestions beyond what I have would be most appreciated. A few I did not add like the Museum of The North because it has a 14 day wait period for travelers since it on a college campus and the colleges have even tighter restrictions than the state
"What about visiting North Pole? It's not far outside of Fairbanks. It's a huge Christmas store and there are some other attractions there, too. The Crepery has good food. If you have hours to kill you could head out the road to Chena Hot Springs. Avoid the restaurant and resort but the wildlife part of the road often has moose."
Why are there COVID-19 tests before leaving home and again near Denali?
"Near Denali is just one of the testing sites. Visitors can get their second test there if they need to.Edited: 5:50 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"Thank you. We will add North Pole by Fairbanks. The Santa Claus House and the Ben Franklin Craft Store there look great for unique shopping. Also, I saw the Angel Rocks Trail looked nice 45 miles Outside Fairbanks, toward Chena Hot Springs, provided no bears."
"I am not a doctor. It was explained to me by one. Alaska wants to make sure we are all safe, tourists and residents. We can test negative in the lower 48 before leaving but then catch the Covid on the plane etc.. The second test in Alaska after seven days is designed to detect that"
"Soar...Covid testing... the reason for wanting a couple tests is due to the timing the virus can take to show up (2 to 114 days is the current thought). So... you can be exposed yesterday, test negative today ; and have it develop/show up (incubate) 10 days later. A high rate of false negatives with the testing process also probably are a good reason to test again.For an interesting read see more of this Harvard report at:https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-…""What are the chances that a coronavirus test will tell me I am not infected when I actually am?The chances that a coronavirus test will give you a false negative (indicating that you are not infected when you actually are infected) depend upon the type of test you have and when in the course of your infection the test is performed. There are two main types of tests:nasal/throat swab tests and saliva tests, both of which detect the virus itselfblood tests that detect antibodies that your immune system produces in response to the infection.If you get the nasal/throat swab or saliva test, you will get a false negative test result:100% of the time on the day you are exposed to the virus. (There are so few viral particles in your nose or saliva so soon after infection that the test cannot detect them.)About 40% of the time if you are tested four days after exposure to the virus.About 20% of the time if you develop symptoms and are tested three days after those symptoms started.This possibility of a false negative test result is why anyone who has symptoms that could be due to COVID-19, or has been exposed to someone known to be infected, must isolate even if they test negative for coronavirus.The blood antibody test does not become positive (or might never be positive in some people) until many days after exposure, and is therefore not the primary test used for diagnosis. It is very useful for research and public health decision making."""
Deb Thank you! Very helpful! We hopefully Leave Sunday if we pass our COVID test Friday
