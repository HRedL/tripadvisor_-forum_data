"I saw several articles this week stating that Portugal would allow tourists from USA, UK, and most of Europe, beginning now (June, 2020). TAP airlines has started flying to Lisbon from Newark NJ and return flights. My question is: I don't see official statements on government/consulate sites that mention if American citizens are able to actually visit for tourism on one of these June flights. Anyone know if it's legal to travel to Portugal from USA this month?"
"I have literally the exact same question. I have looked online, and the best I can find is this:Checked sef.pt and saw that the following persons are allowed to enter by air: ""To passengers of the Portuguese-speaking countries, from South Africa, Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom under the transitional arrangement and Venezuela, as long as the principle of reciprocity is ensured in those countries to the Portuguese citizens."" https:/…1585841681080-ba44aa0a-04fcIt's weird because the list the US as a country that's open, but they list the stipulation of reciprocity, which I don't believe we meet now (with the Trump travel ban).I don't want to book a flight and then get turned away at the airport."
"Exactly, I wonder who is taking these flights? Maybe Portuguese citizens heading to see family? I assume if regular American citizens could fly them, that the travel industry would be spreading the word faster. I have lots of TAP credit I wouldn't mind putting to good use... :)"
Same boat. Planning trip June 18th week but getting contrasting information. Can anyone confirm whether people from the US can go?
"Nobody is (or even was during the State of Emergency) turned away in a portuguese airport because of the nationality.... the communication of the portuguese government when EU decided to close the space to out of Europe flights was that "" due to the portuguese diaspora "" the country would maintain flights to countries outside EU (in fact there were very few flights but they existed...). https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/en/news/Port… You have the US embassy in Portugal website with info about the country reopening, but of course that it doesn't mention that ""now you are allowed to enter"" because you were never denied that... it was just very difficult to get a plane to come and an hotel to stay because they were closed. https:/…"
Thanks for the update. Booked for next week! Going to take a crash course on Portuguese :)
"Sumair - Please let us know how it goes, if you run into any problems entering the country or if it all goes well. Thanks!"
"Thank you for the info. We spoke with our attorney in Lisbon last week and he said things are opening up this week, but we should be fine to enter. We booked direct flights from US to Lisbon because there was no clear info on transiting through the EU or the Azores. I'd be interested to hear if any US citizens have issues with connecting flights."
Talia - please let us know how it goes for you. Thanks.
"We’re US citizens planning to travel to Lisbon on June 28 from San Francisco, connecting in Germany. Will we be allowed to board the plane and also be allowed into Portugal? I cannot find much information."
I have gotten confirmation that it should be okay to travel to Portugal from the US. Going on the 18th. I’ll confirm back if any issues.
"MAP94610 - if the situation does not change you will be OK. Planes have been flying between Germany and Lisbon all along. However, if things do change...There is currently a slight concern over a 'spike' of new cases in Lisbon. With people having been largely confined to their apartments for 12 weeks and unable to meet their friends this is hardly surprising, but worth keeping watch of.Check and check again nearer the time."
"There is currently a slight concern over a 'spike' of new cases in Lisbon - it's mainly on the municipalities around the city, where people with lower incomes are mainly temporary workers, have to use public transport or go all together on small private vans (construction sites and retail warehouses among it). The outbreaks have been identified and are proactively tested by authorities, it's not at the moment a community spread situation. I very much doubt that anything will go back based on these outbreaks. That's the reason why shopping centers have not yet reopened in Lisbon metropolitan area (18 municipalities)."
Good luckWe may goEnjoy the surfingPlease update me!!We may go in July Cheers
"Hi Talia, what direct flights were you able to find? I am in LA and currently have flights through United operated by Lufstansa with a stop in Germany. I was only able to find a direct path to Portugal from Boston to the Azores and nothing to mainland."
"Hello Laura, TAP Portugal is flying twice a week from Newark directly to Lisbon (but only Thursday and Sunday nights). Beware of booking through TAP right now, however, as they won't refund at the moment in case your flight gets canceled, they will only give you vouchers.Edited: 8:21 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"Have you tried contacting the airline at Newark? I want to fly out asap, and have the same questions"
"Sumair, where/ how did you get confirmation?? There is conflicting info out there"
"Sumair, how did you get confirmation?Edited: 2:14 am, June 09, 2020 "
"We are flying Boston to Lisbon direct through Tap Portugal in July. They have 2 flights a week and it's not cheap, but we didn't want to take any chance because we had heard through relatives in Germany that the EU would not let us transit. However, this was a few weeks ago and it was just announced in the news that the EU would open up July 1st, but I haven't been able to find any official notification."
"The EU blocked almost all flights from USA for many weeks. Many countries still have restrictions on international and internal travel, but as you say the EU has 'decreed' that the restrictions on travel between EU countries should be lifted on 1st July.An individual country can still make its own decisions on who it does or does not admit from countries outside the EU."
US citizens CANNOT fly to Portugal
"The New York Times reported a few days ago that Portugal is now allowing US citizens into Portugal. https:/…europe-reopening-tourism-covid.htmlWhere are you getting your source, Desmetde ?"
"I have been in touch with a travel writer, and it originally looked like US citizens were being allowed into Portugal; however, the actual guidance allowed for persons to enter Portugal ""as long as the principle of reciprocity is ensured in those countries to Portuguese citizens"" (https:/…1585841681080-ba44aa0a-04fc). The US does not ensure reciprocity, due to Trump's EU travel ban.The travel writer had originally said that Portugal was not stopping US citizens from entering, but he got back to me last night and said that he received an email saying that the Portuguese version of the TSA has decided to stop letting US citizens enter Portugal due to this reason. He said that this has surprised even some Portuguese tourism groups, as the foreign affairs minister had publicly stated that Portugal was open to US citizens.I don't know when this decision was made, how consistently it's being applied (if at all, at this time), or how long it will last. Trump has stated that he's considering changing the ban to allow for Europeans to enter the US if they're from countries where the virus is under control. However, it is not clear if he will follow through, when he would follow through, and if Portugal would be included on that list.It's all a bit of a mess. I booked a flight with miles for July 1st, and so I'm going to hold onto it for a few more weeks, waiting and hoping that something changes. But really, it's not clear if and when things will improve."
"The Consulate just notified of the same. Citizens coming from countries in which Portuguese is an official language including the US will be allowed to enter as long as it is assured that reciprocity will be given to Portuguese citizens. We will just have to wait and see if the US opens up. cgportugalboston.com/uploads/…flyer.pdfEdited: 12:22 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"I have a flight booked for mid July out of Newark, NJ. Spoke extensively with the rep on the phone from TAP (had vouchers from a planned April trip that was Covid-canclled).He assured me Americans are 100% allowed and welcomed in Portugal right now - which seems to fall in line with all of my research, as well. I'm not sure where the info that ""US citizens cannot travel to Portugal"" is coming from. Can anyone reporting that please provide documentation?"
"I provided the link to the information in my previous post. It's in Portuguese, but it basically says that US citizens will only be admitted if the US provides reciprocity for Portuguese citizens to enter the US. Right now, Portuguese citizens cannot enter the US due to the EU travel ban."
"Thanks, T.Yea, I saw your link - I just couldn't read it, sorry!With so much conflicting info out there, it's very hard to find straight answers. I was just ASSURED yesterday by TAP that USA visitors are welcome. And this interactive map from travel centre also seems to confirm that USA citizens are permitted:https:/…1580226297.htm"
"I don't really know if it is actually being enforced. Tap should be checking passports and if US citizens can't enter, then they shouldn't be allowed to board. They may have more info and the policy may be out there but it may not be followed."
"Might I piggyback a question here...?For a Brit passport holder resident in Italy, I assume that entry will be possible when direct flights start up in July from Malpensa to Lisbon? Might this fall under the third bullet point of point 9 in the sef link - "" To third-country nationals holding a residence permit or a long-stay visa issued by the national authorities;""thoughts?"
"Really hoping that the policy is there but not being enforced, as I am booked on a flight from SF to Lisbon via Amsterdam this Sat/Sun, June 13-14. My partner is Irish and arrived to Lisbon May 21st, without any issue, and Ireland is currently not allowing anyone in. If anyone out there has any more information, please let us know! Also, if I was to get turned back, would it be in Amsterdam, before boarding my KLM flight, or in Lisbon, when I arrive? Thanks!"
"Stunning we can't find clarity on this. I have same issue, flying to Lisbon via Frankfurt on June 18. United said ""we think it should not be a problem"" which does not give me great confidence. You'd think US Embassy in Lisbon would address this, but nothing.  Let's keep at it. Thanks for the insights thus far, even though many are conflicting.Edited: 4:23 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"I am flying out on the 18th as well. Anyone that is able to get in, please do confirm back in this thread."
"Sumair...are you flying direct, or transiting? If latter, where?"
Flying From LA to Paris to Porto
An earlier post on this topic stated that Portugal was never turning away people with a valid passport. It was just that hotels were not open and not many flights available. I hope this is true. Realistically how soon would the US lift the travel ban? It would take a week after it’s announced to probably implement meaning those of us traveling next week may be on ice.
"The reciprocity requirement is part of order n.º 5503-C/2020, enacted on 13 May, lasting until June 15th. It can be found on the website of SEF, Portugal's immigration division, under a FAQ at https:/…1585841681080-ba44aa0a-04fcThis information is also available via an infographic on VisitPortugal's website at https://www.visitportugal.com/en/node/421189It seems as though the government was not previously enforcing it. However, I was told just last night from a friend who heard from a source connected to Portugal's tourism industry that they were informed that Portugal's version of the TSA has now decided to enforce it.The recency of this decision is likely why many people have been told by airlines that they would be fine, since (to the best of my knowledge) even as of yesterday, they would have been. It is not clear when they will begin enforcing this, how the government will communicate with airlines, whether people will be turned away before boarding flights, etc. Perhaps it won't be enforced at all. Perhaps Trump will open the US to Portuguese out of desperation for the economic impact, and then we'll all be allowed to go. Sadly, nobody knows how this will play out over the next couple of weeks.Honestly, I imagine some US citizens might make it through over the next few days out of sheer luck, getting in before everything is communicated from the top down. But just because someone gets in on Friday, doesn't mean another person will get in on Saturday. We'll have to wait and see, and be prepared for last-minute changes."
"Mike G thanks for the detailed response. The Portuguese version of the TSA would not come into the picture unless you actually make it to the country. You are stating that you may likely be turned away before you board the plane. I am willing to take that risk, however, being turned away after landing in the country is a different story. Has your friend mentioned anything about being being turned away after landing in Portugal?"
"I do not believe that anybody has been turned away yet. Nobody knows. They're just starting to enforce the rule, supposedly.And if their TSA decides to enforce it, theoretically they will communicate that to airlines, and then airlines will not let passengers board the flights. However, we have seen how well they communicate. It's entirely possible they'll start enforcing it without the airlines being aware, in which case who knows what will happen to people on arrival.It could be an interesting few weeks coming up."
"As posted on #4 NOBODY with a valid passport was refused entry in Portugal even during the State of Emergency, much less now...."
It seems like it's not being enforced then? The press is now saying that Americans cannot enter until reciprocity is given. https://www.cntraveler.com/story/flights-to-…
"Wow, I read that CN article thoroughly before I purchased my July 19th tickets. The sentence at the end of the first major paragraph (regarding reciprocity) was NOT THERE. They have (admittedly so) updated their article with new, CONFLICTING, info from what was published prior. What a s**t show."
"Given that the numbers with the disease in USA are increasing when here and in Europe generally they are decreasing, it's hardly surprising.But then governments hardly knowing what to do or what to say, is it any wonder than the citizenry is itself confused?As was said some weeks ago, it has taken a disease that affects 0.1% of the US population to deprive the other 99.9% of their civil liberties. Such are the times in which we live."
I’m also baffled! I’m due to fly into Lisbon on June 22nd from New York (connection in Dublin). I have both USA and UK passports and trying to find out whether I’ll be able to enter Portugal and whether I’ll need to quarantine?
Hotels are not a problem.
"I’ve been following these types of threads on Reddit, as I am scheduled to fly to Portugal later this month from the USA with a layover in Paris (flying Delta). There was a woman on Reddit who attempted to fly to Portugal and was turned down at the gate (airport in NYC) because they were requiring that she show proof of citizenship or proof of residency for Portugal to board. Her airline told her that she would be fine and that it would not be a problem (just as Delta has told me), but when she attempted to board the flight- it was another story. I am so confused with all of this as it seems like the EU external border ban is trumping Portugal’s stance on allowing flights from the US. I have no idea what is going on at this point.Edited: 11:36 pm, June 11, 2020 "
Check out this entire thread on Reddit- this woman attempted to fly Lufthansa to Portugal this past week from NY... https:/…
"It's probably because the point of entry into the EU is Germany for that person and Germany hasn't opened up to non-resident EU folks. You have to figure out a way to get there without such a roadblock.Edited: 6:30 am, June 12, 2020 "
"W/ out direct flights from USA to Lisbon (or not many at least) the primary transit airports for most from USA will be Frankfurt (Star Alliance), Amsterdam/Paris (Skyteam)....but since they are simply transiting (showing boarding pass to Lisbon as proof) they aren't entering any of those countries, none of which are welcoming USA passports at this time. so I'm not sure that's the issue. But..clearly no one seems to know."
"Just got off the phone with KLM, and they doubled down on their assurance that US passport holding passengers are allowed to board their Amsterdam>Lisbon flights, as of today. Of course, I am not taking this verbal reassurance as a guarantee that I will be able to get on the plane, or be admitted upon arriving in Lisbon, but I do feel confident enough to give it a go. Not sure what other airlines are doing with regards to passengers who get turned away, but KLM is offering full reimbursement of ticket in the event that this happens. Wish me luck, and I'll keep you all posted."
I messaged with her directly and it wasn’t because of her transit in Germany- they were asking for proof of citizenship or proof of residence in Portugal. They denied her because she had neither for Portugal.
"Either way, everyone who attempts this- please let us know how it goes! May luck be ever in your favor!!!"
So was she denied boarding at an America airport? If so which one?
"Yes- She was denied at Newark in NJ, despite her airline assuring her that she would be able to take the flight. It seems as though Portugal is now doubling down on the “reciprocity” portion of their stance on allowing in other citizens, meaning- until the US allows Portugal in, they can deny us. Anyhow, it’s so confusing and may just be a matter of sheer luck and what airport you travel through."
"Following this thread and hoping for updates as well! I too am concerned about the travel reciprocity part. Hoping for first person reports from some of you traveling to Portugal this coming week. I’m in Mexico right now and flew down on June 8, the first day Cancun reopened officially for tourists. I posted a few detailed reports to update everyone and am now hoping to read something similar for Portugal. Best wishes to everyone going and waiting with high hopes for some positive travel news!"
How did it go for you traveling to Mexico? Supposed to fly there in a couple of weeks!
Also would love to hear about Mexico. Seems like the only country we’re able to travel to in 3 weeks.
I don’t want to hijack this thread to report on Mexico lol but Cancun (and Isla Mujeres where I am right now) is open for tourists. There is a color coded system to determine what activities are allowed and what percentage occupancy each can have and it is updated each Thursday evening to be effective for the following week. Resorts in Cancun that have beaches allow their guests to use the beach (guests only) for swimming and sunbathing and their pools and restaurants are open as well. Not all resorts and restaurants have reopened yet but many more are opening next week and even more the week after that. The governor of the state of Quintana Roo (where Cancun and Isla Mujeres are located) designated tourism as an essential business - this is how they are able to reopen even when the state is in the “red” zone (essential business only). Not all other states have done this so I cannot speak for the situation in Cabo or Puerto Vallarta. If tou go to the Cancun forum (Mexico - Yucatán Peninsula - Quintana Roo - Cancun) I have several trip reports under the post titled “June 8”. I will copy those and post further updates in a new post in that forum and the Isla Mujeres forum early next week as more businesses open and more information comes in. I’m hoping someone does the same for Portugal so that I’m not so anxious about booking a flight and going later this month.
I have tickets for June 26th to Lisbon from Newark if anyone has some information please share!I am a US citizen.
There were people that were set to go today. Does anyone have any updates on the situation?
"Ok. I have an update, as I just completed my long journey into Portugal. It's not great news, however - I was able to get in, but just barely, and it was only because I had in my possession a copy of my partner's family residency papers (they are Irish but live in the Algarve). This happened at my stopover in Amsterdam, where I had to go through customs. After showing my US Passport, they proceeded to inform me that US citizens are no longer allowed into the Schengen. I had a back up plan in place (copies of the residency papers), and after 5 long minutes with one of the supervisors, he reluctantly stamped my passport. So, long story short, I don't think US passport holders will be let in until things change. Of course, you could get lucky, but after my experience, I wouldn't risk it."
Thanks for the feedback Sean.
Thank you for feedback.
"Sumair, if you're able to travel tell me. My bf is American and we wanna know if it is possible. Best luck. You'll love Portugal :)"
"Sean, were you able to fly here? Thank you and best luck!"
thanks!!
"Thanks for the update Sean. Raquel, if I do decide to go I will definitely update you. I am currently scheduled for the 18th"
"So i think there is good news, but maybe someone else can help figuring out what this means.5612-A/2020, de 19 Maio, this is the name of the resolution regarding travel restrictions. It used to be available on this link: https:/…maximizedIt was supposed to expire today and also as you can see the link doesnt work anymore.Does this mean the resolution isnt active anymore?My girlfried also wants to fly from the US on 18th, would be great to have some clarity on the situation. I myself was able to fly from germany 2 weeks ago, even though in my understanding there was an official ban as well. Also them saying americans are not allowed into shengen sounds strange, as borders are a thing of each country, the eu has no say over that.Edited: 2:15 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"Mnado80, are you flying direct on Tap? I'd be interested to see if they are allowing direct flights in. The official ReopenEU site says Portugal is open to US citizens with no reference to reciprocity."
Yes its directI called TAP last week got through their skype line and they said i should be fine but now since then i amTrying to reach Them to confirm noone is answering!!!!!
Please update us all i am scheduled for the 26th
"Sean, Were part of your issues based on the fact that you were in Amsterdam?I'm curious how if it would be different if an American flew from Newark directly into Portugal."
"A couple of other questions....Anybody care to speculate on whether the reciprocity deal may be set aside July 1st?Also, if Portugal may just set it aside due to a need for tourist dollars? (With Italy, I imagine they care more about tourist revenue than reciprocity, but who knows anything anymore).Anybody else due to arrive into Portugal soon?"
Hi - we are U.S. residents currently flying to Portugal on June 18 with TAP. Tried a number of times and ways to contact TAP to either cancel or reschedule our flights but No one answered.. we are a family of 4 with 2 small children and the last thing we want is to be refused to enter the country and be stuck at the Lisbon airport. Any suggestion/advice to reach TAP or what we should/can do? Thanks!
Everyone is having the same problem they don't answer!! I have tickets for me and my 3 children for the 26th from Newark. I decided to drive from CT on the 18th just so i can talk to someone. They have flights twice a week. I don't want to pack and be denied traveling. But today on their website there was some good news.
Mnado80 - what good news are you referring to? I was just on TAP website it states that US residents can only make “essential trips” to Portugal.
"I travelled 3 weeks ago to England when ""essential"" was the only traveling allowed i was asked what's the reason for your trip i said personal and was let it. Essential is not a pb coz otherwise they would have said with proof of it."
"Our original plan was to stay in Portugal for 6 weeks...If we are not allowed to enter upon arrival, we are thinking going to somewhere for 2-3 weeks and then try to get back in to Portugal once travel restriction eases (instead of taking the next flight back to the USA). Open to any suggestions for back up plans..."
"Same exact situation as yours. Flight to Portugal leaves on the 18th, but preparing a backup trip. We are currently looking into Lake Tahoe, San Francisco (I hear Napa valley is open), San Diego, Vegas and Yosemite National Park."
Please update us if you do go on your trip. Im ready to drop everything and travel to Portugal if they actually are allowing Americans to enter
"We were able to reschedule our trip to July 16, hoping things will ease up after July 1."
https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/PRTStill vague but from an EU website.
"Yes, that's the confusing point, or at least one of them, for sure. Several sites indicate ""flights"" from the USA are welcome, but don't provide specifics about what passports those passengers need to be traveling with for entry. Seems same issue with Greece opening on July 1 to flights from USA and other places. They welcome the flights, but have not clarified what passports those passengers need to be using in order to get past immigration. Aargh! But it all makes sense...the majority of the Schengen countries don't want American travelers right now, and once they enter Portugal (or Greece) they can (and will) wander through many other Schengen countries...where they are not wanted. I fear Portugal and Greece are giving many of us false hope."
"Hi everyone, I'm also on the June 26 flight from Newark to Lisbon, Portugal. My situation is slightly different, as I have a residency card in Portugal -- but there is a catch: my card is in Portugal and not with me haha! It was being processed when I left for COVID in March & my former roommate has it... so I will be traveling with photo copies of the card... anyway, I will be eagerly watching this thread for the June 18 flight and keep everyone updated on what happens to me & others on the 26th.Edited: 11:38 pm, June 17, 2020 "
Sorry guys but we decided to cancel our flight. Too much uncertainty and a lot of variables at play. My layover in Paris was what was most concerning.
I am driving to Newark today feventho my flight is on the 25th to get some answers from an actual TAP agent. I will update asa i get some.
"Hi! Also in this boat of non-Portuguese reading tea leaves to interpret the current vague guidelines. I am a Romanian (EU) citizen living in the US (Residency) with my American wife who booked a trip with TAP (from Newark) on June 28th (direct no stopover) and we cannot get any clear guidance from SEF.PT, TAP or any government-related agency on whether non-Portuguese/non-Portuguese resident EU nationals can enter Portugal (let alone Americans however the point on reciprocity for Portuguese entering the US at this time is a little more clear cut). We are also thinking of driving to Newark today or prior to the next flight out to get clarifications...following this thread closely!"
"Some additional information:Tap Portugal: On the phone, a representative indicated that there are no restrictions from June 15 onward. The representative mentioned that only proof of a negative COVID-19 test result from a lab 72 hrs in advance was a requirement (however I believe this is only the case for arrival in Azores/Madeiras). The representative would not put this information in an e-mail however, but this is the most information we have extracted out of TAP Portugal in days.Portuguese Embassy in Washington: In the (maybe rare) case that you are an EU national with a US relative/spouse trying to fly to Portugal from the US at this time, you may enter Portugal, the EU national showing their EU passport and proof of relative status (i.e. marriage certificate) for the US citizen relative.Hope this might help a few people. Still curious for feedback from those who go to EWR today to get information on TAP flights."
"Thanks, Mnado80!We are anxiously awaiting your report! :)"
"Following this thread closely....I am not so concerned about getting into Portugal as it looks like US Citizens are getting in ok, but my issue is the quarantine that US Citizens when we arrive back in the US. If we come from a Schengen country then we must self quarantine for 2 weeks and it looks like health officials are suppose to follow up with people to ensure they are doing this. We were looking to go to Portugal for about 1.5 weeks, but we cant stay out of work for 3.5 weeks.Anyone heard anything else about the quarantine mandate going away?"
"What do you mean by traveling residence papers? I am a Brazilian living in Canada (Work Permit) traveling with both my daughters, the younger is 16 and both are Portuguese citizens. According to IATA (https:/…1580226297.htm), family members (as per the definition of https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02004L0038-20110616&from=EN) are allowed to enter. But we have a cousin. who is also coming, who is a Canadian Citizen, whose grandmother resides in Portugal. Do you think that can help her? I mean, if we get the residence papers"
Any news? :)
Hi Josh! I have a ticket booked from ATL-AMS-LIS this Sunday. Why do you think that US citizens are getting into Portugal OK? I'm worried ;)
I think I have read every article on the internet over the last week. I can’t even tell you how many times a day I google search “travel ban” or “Portugal”. Everything I have read has been stating that US Citizens are getting and allowed in the US. I think I have read only one article that mentioned someone having an issue. I do not see on any government website stating any reciprocity rule they are following. Are you anticipating having to quarantine when you get back?
And of course I decided to do more digging after that last post and use the keyword “reciprocity” and what do ya know... an article was revised 2 days ago so ok maybe I am now getting worried about even entering...here is the article https:/…
"IATA just updated their web site. Airlines use them as guidance on whether to allow passengers, I think. The news is not good. See for yourself. https:/…1580226297.htm"
"Yes, now IATA clarified the situation. As I understood, only EU citizens, EU residents, and their family members are allowed to enter. We have also the EU guidelines: https:/…travel-and-eu-during-pandemic_en"
"ReopenEU web site is being very misleading. https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/PRTThe mission statement as stated on their home page is “This interactive tool provides you with the information that you need to confidently plan your European travel and holidays, while staying healthy and safe.”OMFG. What a joke.Edited: 10:56 pm, June 18, 2020 "
Which airline are you going through and do you have layover in Europe? My bigger concern was the layover.

TAP airlines direct. Even with a layover u should be all set as this is Portugal rules For US citizens not TAP airlines so have a return ticket ready to show and the accommodation.
"Just so I understand, TAP is saying OK to enter Portugal even with a layover? I called Delta yesterday and they assured me that I was good to go and that their computer system would flag my itinerary if I weren't able to travel. I layover in AMS and that's where I'll either be able to enter the EU or not. I follow IATA everyday and noticed yesterday that it had changed and that's why I'm nervous now. Does anyone know what documentation is needed to prove business travel? Italy will allow Americans in and I could definitely set up some meeting for work next week but I'm not sure what's sufficient documentation. Also, if I had a brother living in an EU country, how would someone prove that?"
"Just spoke again to Delta who also confirmed with KLM that I'm good to transit through AMS and enter LIS. Fingers crossed. At this point, I'm still going to plan on leaving Sunday. Worth noting, if Delta lets me on the plane departing ATL and for some reason I'm denied transit through AMS or entry into LIS, it's their responsibility to bring me back to the US."
"CollenFS, please keep us posted. I would like to know if you were able to enter"
"Hi guys, so much conflicting information online, we want to travel to Lisbon in August/September of this year, US Resident (mexican passport) and US Citizen from Texas, the Re-Open EU page was updated today but still vague information. US is still not allowing ppl visiting from Europe so that means we wont be able to enter, correct?"
well never mind i just spoke to consulate of portugal in miami and they are not allowing americans in due to our high rate of covid cases.
"Now they updated the requirements on the SEF website https:/…1585841681080-ba44aa0a-04fc. To fly from the US, you need to be either a European citizen, an EU permanent resident, a family member of those or be a national of a Portuguese speaking country."
I saw this too but can’t tell if it applies to the autonomous region of the Azores?! Azores site still says Americans can enter with a negative Covid test but they are part of Portugal. Ugh! I’m supposed to go July 6!

Any news from anyone?? Anyone make it in the last few days?
Any news? Collen do you have an update?
"I'm an American w/ EU residency so it's not a problem for me to travel to Lisbon, which I did last night from FRA. Packed flight and I heard some No. American accents on the flight, but not sure if they have residency like me, or transiting through FRA, or other. Lisbon is very quiet but things seem to be opening (it's a quiet Sunday right now). Let's just say it's not hard to get a good seat in any restaurant and lots of all-day happy hours. Sadly, I'm about ready to give up hope on my daughter from USA being able to join us here in coming weeks."
"I am an EU citizen (without EU residency) living in the USA with hopes of flying to Lisbon on the 28th. From the IATA's new guidance, I feel unsure if I will be able to enter if not traveling from one of the listed EU states. I have emailed with SEF and they have told me I will be able to enter, but still feeling nervous."
Did SEF answer your email? You could use it in the border if they refuse you
"They did, yes!"
"The problem is that even governments are seemingly making up the rules as they go along. Denmark and Austria, among others, announced a few days ago that they would ban anyone coming from Portugal.Portugal may 'retaliate' if that holds.Doors may shut as easily as they may open, depending on what recent happenings there might have been in recent days.Certainly bring a copy of any evidence from officialdom concerning rights of entry."
"Cait T, could you share the email you used to communicate with SEF? Was it gricrp.cc@sef.pt? Thank you very much"
@caiWhat’s the email address that you sent to? They didn’t reply my emails.
"Of course, I received a response from the sef@sef.pt email address. I will say it takes a bit of time to receive a response (anywhere from 24-72 hours in my case). I initially reached out to gricrp.cc@sef.pt, but I never heard back when emailing that address."
"I emailed both addresses and no reply. Hmm.Maybe they don’t know neither. :)Edited: 12:22 pm, June 21, 2020 "
@cait This I think is a useful link to https:/…It is updated once a day and serves as guidance to airports
"@anaCool link. But just because a planes flies there doesn’t mean you can enter. That’s why I like the IATA site. The way it’s worded, the immigration requirements and flight requirements are spelled out separately."
"@Avonord I agree with you, The 2 requirements need to be read together.BUT,Did you take a close look at the document provided in the link? It is a Table that has different columns for Flight Restrictions and PAX (meaning passenger) restrictions.If you go to the columns related to Portugal, you are going to see that on flight restrictions, there is a restriction for direct flights from outside EU, even if they stop first in another EU country, WITH EXCEPTIONS to Canada, USA, Brazi, South Africa, Venezuela and a bunch of other Portuguese speaking countries, very much with the same wording you can find in the updated SEF guidelines. (https:/…1585841681080-ba44aa0a-04fc). So, to my understanding, you will be allowed in Portugal by air only if you are a EU Citizen, a EU citizen relative (under Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council), a resident of Portugal AND you are coming either in a flight that originated inside European border, OR if, outside Europe, it is flying from Canada, USA, Brazil, South Africa, Venezuela and a bunch of other Portuguese speaking countries.I think the only ""grey area"" in the SEF guidelines (that I think are more binding then IATA, because were provided by Portugal Gov itself, is about ""passengers of the Portuguese-speaking countries, from South Africa, Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom under the transitional arrangement and Venezuela"" that are not EU citizens, EU family members or Portuguese Residents, because of the reciprocity requirement."
"@AnaThat link you posted is incomplete at best. I don’t see any PAX requirement for Portugal, except the one for Madeira. I know there is a test/quarantine requirement in effect for Azores, but it’s nowhere to be found in your doc. If you look at the disclaimer at the top of the doc, it’s not giving me much confidence. Compare to that of the IATA site:“ To enable airlines and other aviation partners to securely manage the passenger document verification process, Timatic solutions require 100% reliable information. To achieve this we partner with airlines, as well as developing closer bilateral relations with government agencies worldwide. “"
"@Avonord I posted the link just as an alternative source. But do you agree that there is a conflict of information between SEF requirements and IATA requirements? And what about non-European citizens/ relatives/ Portuguese residents? Do you think people holding American Passports (or Canadian, Brazilian etc) will be allowed in? IATA is silent about it, but not SEF. Even if we know that none of the above-mentioned countries are letting Portuguese Citizens in, some people are saying that Portugal has not been enforcing the reciprocity rules so far.I would like to hear from people in this thread who were scheduled to fly today."
"I like to hear from people too. But just because some people could go in today doesn’t mean we can go in tomorrow. How is SEF not being silent? I sent them email about reciprocity and they didn’t respond. They replied @Cait only because he/she is a EU citizen. I think there is no conflict between SEF site and IATA site. SEF site only lacks clarity about “reciprocity”. Maybe on purpose, to serve as an olive beach to US/Canadian government. IATA does not mention the word “reciprocity” and provides a clear and concise list of passenger requirement. If u interpret the SEF requirement with “reciprocity not fulfilled”, then I think it’s exactly the same as the IATA requirements."
"Yes, I think what you said makes sense. But they could clarify it. Also, you should take into consideration the requirements for transit. Is there any direct flights from Canada?"
@AnaYea. TAP has flights to Azores and Lisbon directly.
"That brings another weird situation. as per IATA guidelines. According to then, if you are a European Citizen you will not be able to travel unless you come from another EU country.Does that make sense to you?Edited: 5:23 pm, June 21, 2020 "
@AnaI don’t see that on IATA site. Which bullet?
"@Avonord Bullet 1This does not apply to nationals of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, IF THEY ARE ARRIVING FROM Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden or Switzerland.- This does not apply to family members of nationals of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland,IF THEY ARE ARRIVING FROM Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden or Switzerland"
@AnnOhhhhhh.. u r right. I never saw that part. Lol. Good catch.
"@Avonord I am bilingual (Portuguese (native)/ English) and if you read the Portuguese version, ""FROM"", means people of Schengen associated countries, in other words, EU Citizens + people from Schengen associated countries and their family members are allowed to enter no matter where they are coming from.The thing is in Portuguese the words ""DE"" and ""DOS"", can mean both ""from"" and ""of"".And this makes no sense because nationals from Portugal cannot be restricted to enter in their own country of citizenship.Here the passage in both languages:""To nationals OF a Member State of the European Union, FROM the Schengen associated countries authorised under Order n.º 5503-C/2020, n.º 1, of 13 May, and their relatives under Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, except where, in transit, they travel to a Member State other than of their nationality in which they cannot avail themselves of their right of free movement;""""Aos nacionais DE um Estado Membro da União Europeia, DOS países associados de Schengen autorizados nos termos do n.º 1 do Despacho n.º 5503-C/2020, de 13 de maio, e membros das respetivas famílias nos termos da Diretiva 2004/38/CE do Parlamento e do Conselho, salvo quando, em trânsito, se desloquem para um Estado Membro que não o da sua nacionalidade no qual não possam exercer o direito de livre circulação;""Edited: 7:00 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"I've been following this thread for a while as we are supposed to leave July 1 for Porto and I've been waiting to see what's going to happen with that. From my understanding, we (U.S. Citizens) will only be allowed entry if the EU decides to lift external border restrictions with the U.S. (unlikely by July 1) or if Trump decides to lift EU border restrictions that he's put in place. I found this in the press briefing from this past Friday:""Q Thanks, Kayleigh. The EU nations are starting to ease their travels restrictions between their own borders. Is the President planning on rolling back EU travel restrictions? He said back in May that that he’ll probably ease them out sometime in the future.MS. MCENANY: The President knows that the travel restrictions were a very important component to saving lives. Almost 3 million could have been — could have perished, and those travel restrictions were instrumental in taking early action and saving American lives. He monitors the data constantly.No plans now as to lifting those, but it’s ultimately the decision of the President. He’s guided by data and the safety and — and the health of the American people.""Here's the link: https:/…So my guess is nobody has gotten into or will get into Portugal this week - and probably not as of July 1st either."
"I agree. I think Canada will probably be included in the list of countries allowed in the EU after July 1st, But not the USA. And we can't blame them, it is not just Trump's ban, but also COVID-19 is far from controlled in the US.Let's wait and see what July will bring."
"@AnaSorry, I was playing with my niece and I didn’t read your post carefully. What’s wrong with the IATA contents?Basically, according to IATA, there’s a list of European countries that Portugal deem safe. And Portugal would allow their citizens entry if they come from those countries. And for other EU countries not On that list, Portugal would let their citizens transit through Portugal I’d they are going home. Pretty sure that’s consistent with SEF site. The only inconsistency I found is with ReopenEU site. But again, if u look at the disclaimer on the ReopenEU home page, it doesn’t promise the info to be accurate. So, again, my take is SEF is the definitive source for entry requirements. IATA comes second and is a good source for clarifications."
"@AnaCanada is in good shape in terms of the virus. But politicians here are willing to create untold economic damage to save lives. To me, it seems the US is towards the other end of the scale, economy over lives. At the end, it’s probably going to be the same next month for both US and Canada when it comes to Portugal. Portugal will not open border with US because of number of new cases. Canada will not open border to Portugal because we are playing save, and Portugal reciprocate by closing its border to Canadians.Edited: 9:01 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"I just wanted to put this to bed. I had zero issues traveling through USA-CDG-LIS. Passport was stamped in France. Border guard didn’t ask anything just stamped and sent me on my way. In Lisbon, again no one asked me any questions as it seems like the border situation has returned to “normal-ish” Schengen travel.I was very surprised to see that my flight from CDG-LIS was packed.Definitely consider traveling to EUR."
@sean That is great! When did you fly?
Saturday-Sunday
@sean so you arrived in Lisbon today?
Sean: are you planning on quarantining 2 weeks when you get back? I’m still not sure if it is a requirement or a suggestion. One article I read said local health officials would do random checks to ensure you are.
@Sean D are you a U.S citizen? Do you have any other citizenship or residency in Europe? Were you just a tourist going to Portugal? I'm waiting to hear some confirmation of U.S citizens traveling to Portugal for tourism. I'm a U.S citizen who is already overseas (S.E Asia) and was looking at Portugal as a possible option.
@Josh C to my knowledge.. only Hawaii has that requirements and no other states
"Josh, it depends on the state. My state requires a 14 day quarantine for any travel by air. My job requires it too, but it's not an issue as I usually work from home anyways. My husband's job has a 7 day quarantine then a negative covid test before coming back to work. Each state and company seem to have different policies."
"I am so confused. I’m reading it as if you have been to one of those countries you must quarantine. Passengers who have been in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China (People's Rep.), Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland or United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe) in the past 14 days but are exempt from the restriction to enter the USA, must self-quarantine for 14 days once they reach their final destination."
"@Josh oh you're right! I forgot China, Iran, and Europe was still on that list. Yes, it should be mandatory to quarantine for 14 days upon return. Dang, I forgot about that requirement."
"This is where the issue is for me... I feel pretty confident about getting into Portugal, however I can not take an extra 2 weeks off from work to quarantine. Does anyone have any experience with this? How strict are they being... are they actually using local health officials to follow up?"
"I got a response back from SEF. Pretty clear cut from the last sentence""Due to the State of National Emergency and the State of Calamity, until 11:59 pm on June 30, there are several restrictions on air connections. Flights to and from countries outside the European Union are prohibited in Portuguese airspace, with the exception of:i) To nationals of a Member State of the European Union, of the Schengen associated countries authorized under the terms of paragraph 1 of Order no. 5503-C / 2020, of 13 May, and members of their families under the terms of the Directive 2004/38 / EC of the Parliament and the Council, except when, in transit, they move to a Member State other than that of their nationality in which they cannot exercise the right of free movement;ii) Passengers from Portuguese-speaking countries, South Africa, Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom under the terms of the transition agreement and Venezuela provided that reciprocity of treatment is guaranteed in those countries to Portuguese citizens;iii) third-country nationals who hold a residence permit or long-stay visa issued by national authorities;(…)With regard to point III) if the Portuguese cannot enter the United States, citizens traveling from the United States cannot enter Portugal either.At the current juncture, tourism trips to Portugal are not advisable.​"""
Wow that is as clear cut as it can get.I have a feeling that is not being enforced or its not being shared among all staff.
After reading that I am going to wait until July 1 to decide.There will be stories of people being allowed in and people being turned back as it will be down to whims of certain agents on border. But i need to know a definite before traveling with family.
"I am right there with you. I have yet to purchase tickets yet, but have everything planned out as well as time off from work. We want to go July 16-26, but I am scared to bite the bullet right now and then again I'm nervous about waiting."
"Reading the coronavirus.gov website takes me to the CDC website with FAQ on traveling back from Europe. It says The CDC “recommends” quarantining but it does not say required to. Has anyone traveled back from Europe with their experiences around this? As further provided in each proclamation, citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States, certain family members, and other individuals who meet specified exceptionsexternal icon, who have been in one of the countries listed above in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States through one of 15 airportsexternal icon. After arriving to the United States from one of these countries, CDC recommends that travelers stay home and monitor their health for 14 days. More information about what to do after arriving to the United States is available on CDC’s Returning from International Travel webpage."
"Per TAP:Travelling from the United Stated to PortugalUS citizens will exceptionally be allowed into Portugal for essential trips that prove they have accommodation, means of subsistence and proof of return to their country after their stay in Portugal or that, for proven urgent professional reasons, need to travel.I'm a american citizen, have my uncle live in Lisbon, is it considered family member right?"
A family member is defined by in Articles 2(2) and 3(2) of Directive 2004/38/EC).
Does anyone actually successfully entered Portugal? I'm flying out this Friday.....

"Hi bstommieI'm flying this Friday from LA-AMS-Lis. At this moment, I want to take my chance..... but we will see..."
"Here is an update to my situation and give more clarity. I’ve managed to fly from USA-CDG-LIS-Rome with zero issues and almost no border restrictions. I’m a remote worker, so quarantining is no issue for me.Io e traveled with my fiancé (Italian citizen). To the one guy trying to get his fiancé to Germany. I’d recommend telling your fiancé to buy a ticket with Some documentation she is marrying a EU citizen and say it’s upon arrival. EU cannot spouses even if they are there illegally. To the rest of you worried about traveling to Europe, the law and situation on the ground are different. Almost all quarantine restrictions have been lifting, all the shops are open, sports, etc. Everything is very lightly enforced, in fact restrictions in the USA are way worse than they are here in Italy. Tourism is booming, each budget airline we took has been packed and the only type of security measure is a temp check.I really wouldn’t freak out about getting in to Europe. It’s the restrictions back in the USA that are bad plus media making it seem very restrictive. Again “you do you”, but from my experience I had zero issues getting into Italy."
Confirmed with Portugal embassy at DC: US citizen can not be allowed to enter Portugal at this moment.
"Thanks for this update. It’s very confusing as even the EU’s own website says US citizens can enter. https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/PRTThis site was updated on the 23rd, after the rules had supposedly changed."
"The EU website does NOT state that US citizens can enter Portugal or indeed Europe as a whole. It does say that people coming on flights from USA can enter. These are two entirely different things.I do agree that the wording there could be better, but the statements elsewhere are unequivocal. No entry to US citizens for tourism purposes."
"It seems almost certain people coming from the U.S will be banned on 1 July, 2020. Better hurry up and get to Europe ASAP before they slam the doors shut."
"I have a flight booked for July 19, but for the first time since I booked, I truly do not think its going to happen. As of today, Portugal was NOT granted inclusion into the ""air bridge"" with the UK, which is a huge blow for them.The bright side is: maybe now that they will not be receiving the millions of UK visitors, they will ease restrictions on US visitors to make up for the loss of money?? Or maybe I'm just being unrealistic and overly-optimistic. I will give it a few more days before I begin requesting all of money back from hotels and airlines :/"
"So. I am at Ottawa airport and I am flying to Portugal through Germany. I am a Brazilian citizen and Canadian PR. I am boarding the plane just because my daughters, who are traveling with me, are Portuguese citizens. They denied a Canadian and an American family while I was waiting my clearance. It was stressful, because they called Germany border service and I needed to wait their response. But thank God all good. I hope Europe open its borders to Canada and the USA sooner than later and all you guys are allowed in."

"Hi everyone, I have an update from the ground. I can't speak to what happened last week, days ago, or even yesterday, but as of today TAP Portugal will not give you your boarding pass on the flight from EWR to LIS without European documentation. I was allowed my boarding pass by having photocopies of my Portuguese residency card, and I saw other sets of documents getting approved (can't speak in any detail to what those documents were and issued by which countries, governments, or agencies).

I cannot say whether they were dual citizens in the US or simply returning to Portugal after some time in the US. We were a rare case. Upon arriving at the luggage counter for TAP we showed our two passports (1 EU, 1 US) as well as a marriage certificate. No more questions were asked. We had an American next to us who was going to Lisbon to meet his Portuguese fiance: he was being asked to show documents linked to obtaining the fiance visa.: unclear if he made it on but it appeared that if he was able to produce sufficient documentation linking him as a relative/soon-to-be relative of a Portuguese national that he would be allowed to fly. There was also an American family, only with US passports, that were being turned away: they were of course letting the TAP employees hear it for selling tickets to those that likely would be unable to fly. Upon arriving at Lisbon, customs reviewed our passports and marriage certificate again and let us in. My interpretation of this is, Portugal is walking a fine line between following EU guidelines and supporting a boost in tourism by maintaining a grey area in terms of visitors arriving from the US: if you can prove sufficient connection to the EU (EU passport ideally), they are likely to let you in. Arriving only with US passports for non-essential travel such as tourism will not cut it at his time. Hope this helps shed additional light on what is a cloudy situation."
Thank you for this trip report !!!!! - exactly what I was looking for!!!
"Well this could be problematic for me:""Travelers’ country of residence, not their nationality, will be the determining factor for their ability to travel to countries in the European Union, officials said""E.U. Formalizes Reopening, Barring Travelers From U.S. https://nyti.ms/3eOs8RT"
Isn't it that anyone flying from the U.S is banned?
"Turns out no, EU citizens and family members are permitted to travel."
"@Lukasz Are you sure? According to the press release, I think you were right initially. It's about your residentship rather than your nationality that matters..https:/…"
"From a previous post...""Travelers’ country of residence, not their nationality, will be the determining factor for their ability to travel to countries in the European Union, officials said""Then, that means that EU nationals that reside permanently in the US would not be allowed to travel..."
"If you look at the release out had an exceptions section:For countries where travel restrictions continue to apply, the following categories of people should be exempted from the restrictions:EU citizens and their family memberslong-term EU residents and their family members"
This is of interest to me too — I reside in the US but am a UK national.
"I fly to Portugal tomorrow through Frankfurt. The whole family took the Coronavirus test yesterday, it was negative. I have all the rules printed out in case any border patrol gives us trouble. EU citizen + family (US passports). Staying in Albufeira for 4 days, Sintra for 8 and Porto for 4. Traveling everywhere by car."
"Hi Lukasz C...tell us how it went, we got the same itinerary on the 15th"
"So I had the the IATA rules printed out and highlighted, the gate agent started saying ""you can't.."" as I handed him the highlighted portions. He read them and said ""great!"". They want you to be able to fly, but they don't have every countries exceptions memorized. I'm on the plane now. I'll update if and when I get past passport control."
"You're doing a great job to the community. Appreciate it, safe travels!"
"Arrived in Frankfurt, no problem during passport control since I'm transiting. Now I'm waiting to board my flight to Lisbon. International terminal was desolate, the regional terminal is actually fairly busy."
"Thanks, good luck buddy, safe trip!"
"Made it! Just arrived at the hotel! They have an automated system checking temperatures as you exit the airport, but they don't check whether you've had a Covid test unless it's an international flight coming in. No one checked or asked to see ours. My hotel says they are near capacity, but that's the mandated reduced capacity of 67%."
Thank you Sir. much appreciated. We will attempt leaving Houston on Lufthansa on the 15th. Thank you for letting us know your experience
Thanks Lukasz - do you have a link the the IATA rules you printed and highlighted?
"Sure, https:/…1580226297.htmClick on Portugal, select the text and print it."
Many thanks Lukasz.
"July 15 Houston to Frankfurt no issues, July 16 Frankfurt to Lisbon, no issues, no questions on covid test either. Both airports practically deserted. Immigration done in Frankfurt, flight to Lisbon was a Schengen internal flight, no borders."
"Hello, thank you for sharing your experience of travelling to Portugal. May I please ask you share what is open there and how people are responding to US citizens there. We had planned a trip in July initially before the ‘essential business’ restriction was announced. I have moved it twice now to Sept and want to see if it’s worth travelling there during this time. Thanks"
"It was an amazing trip. Everything was open except for some museums. You get to see the sights without a ton of tourists, which made this trip particulary enjoyable. Restaurants are open, no problem getting tables at the best places in town. No beach I saw had an issues with crowds. Cities like Lisbon and Coimbra feel like ghost towns in spots. The place that seemed to be doing best tourist wise was Porto."
Thank you so much for sharing. I am so glad you had fun.  Did Portuguese folks have any reaction to seeing Americans there?
The Portuguese were super friendly and they were very happy to see us!
Great! Thank you for sharing.

"Does anyone have any update whether US citizens can travel to Azores? We have a trip booked in mid september. From what I understand, all of EU is closed to US tourists. Anyone on the ground there has any idea if it could potentially open up in September? Today US lifted the DO NOT TRAVEL order, so possibly will be more of reason for EU to let us in? Can Portugal independently allow US tourists regardless if EU remains closed? I believe Portugal allows certain travelers in and our flight has not yet been canceled (but changed several times). Any advice?"
"""Anyone on the ground there has any idea if it could potentially open up in September?""I doubt anyone here can second guess the experts employed by our governments. Individual EU countries are still introducing quarantines for arrivals from other countries or even parts of countries at 24 hours notice depending on what they think is going on. Let alone what may or may not apply to USA. Even within that, certain regions of Portugal eg Azores and Madeira have compulsory virus tests for all arrivals no matter from where.If the USA now allows you to leave, it is incumbent upon you to check official sources very carefullyas to whether the country of your choice will admit you. You must also consider the risk of not being allowed to travel back to the USA should the situation change. There is also the very important additional travel and health insurance aspects of any planned trip to Europe for the foreseeable future.Edited: 2:41 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"Can Portugal independently allow US tourists regardless if EU remains closed? It can, but it will not do it. Now the law is that ""The Government of Portugal currently prohibits non-essential (tourist) travel to Portugal by U.S. citizens."" In September how knows??"
"Thanks for the info, can you please clarify, (assuming we can actually be allowed to come) if we can bring our own test, whether Azores requires to their own test on arrival regardless of of official negative test within 72 hours from US? ? If thats the case, is it done at the airport in Lisbon during our layover or at the Airport in azores and how long before you get results?"
Thanks. Keeping hope alive!
"whether Azores requires to their own test on arrival regardless of of official negative test within 72 hours from US? You can take you negative PCR test, printed and signed from an official laboratory. In Lisbon on transit you'll not be asked for a test, just at the arrival to Azores."
Thanks ptnov
"Hi, I have found that one of the best source of the information for Portugal is this https:/….Good luck, please share how your trip goes. Here is the Azores info from this link- All Americans arriving to the Azores must provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken 72 hours prior to arrival. Travelers who wish to remain in the Azores for more than 7 days, will be required to test again on the 5th day. To speed the process on arrival, the Regional Government of the Azores suggests travelers fill in a health questionnaire at least 72 hours before disembarking. For more information please visit: Covid19Azores."
"@trailbrazerThe second test is on 6th day and not the 5th. Many sites out there that reiterate information, some does so wrongly or out of date. It’s best to get it out of horses mouth. For Covid 19 related info specific to Azores, get it from link below. You will find a translation bar at the bottom where you can choose English. https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/As far as flight restrictions and things like that, use the IATA site. They can get out of date if things change too fast too, but things seem to have stabilized now. Back in June, they were pretty messed up."
Thank you for sharing your story. I have delayed this trip 3 times because cannot get accurate information. I am now planning to fly Seattle to Lisbon via Amsterdam I am a Portuguese citizen as well US citizen my wife is a US citizen also Thai citizen wife is worried that she might be turned away upon check in. I am planning to take the covid19 test 72 hours prior and bring our marriage certificate as well. I am keeping my fingers crossed and look for all the positives
"This is so confusing... EU borders are closed for the US citizen, but according to TAP web site, US citizen can enter Portugal with a negative molecular RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to departure. Did anyone here with a US citizenship recently fly directly from JFK or BOS to Lisbon? Thanks!"
@robSounds like out of date info. Check iata site.
