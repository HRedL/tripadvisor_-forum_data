"Bermuda offers guests an accessible, safe destination with wide open spaces and pink sand beaches, clean ocean breezes and brilliant turquoise waters, plus meaningful cultural connections and fresh island fare. Delta Airlines resumed service to Bermuda via Atlanta on July 6. JetBlue will restart service from JFK as well as Boston August 1. Air Canada was the first international airline to touch down with commercial traffic on July 2 from Toronto, and WestJet will add in service to the island beginning August 6 from Toronto as well. British Airways is set to resume service from London starting July 17, and the UK Government included Bermuda on its list of places their residents can visit this summer and be exempt from quarantine upon arrival back to England. As always, visitors and travel professionals are encouraged to check with airlines directly for the latest updates to service. A variety of pristine, spacious resorts and clean, comfortable cottages are open to host guests beginning in July such as Rosewood Bermuda, The Loren Hotel, Royal Palms, Grape Bay Cottages and more. Beautiful views, plenty of room, safe and healthy service await. For a full list of properties already open and other anticipated opening dates, visit the travel alert page on gotobermuda.com."
"To Bermuda Tourism: You really think tourists are coming down with the current protocols required?I understand 2 people on a flight from the US tested positive upon arrival.In any case, I wouldn't set foot anywhere that US individuals were, have you not read about the virus disaster in the US? I guess it's greed over safety of your citizens."
"Does anyone know the position for accommodation refunds if we can’t fly? We were due to come in with JetBlue who cancelled the flight, and BA can’t get us home either. We were due to stay at Clairfont but my emails to them bounce back. We paid 2 nights non-refundable deposit but as we can’t get there, should this now be refundable? Or claimable through my credit card provider? This was a one off family trip to Bermuda and sadly we won’t now be coming, so a credit for a future stay is worthless to us.Anyone else in the same position?"
">>>...Does anyone know the position for accommodation refunds if we can’t fly?...<<<Sorry....there are NO hard 'n fast rules about cancellations for any reason. These are dealt with on a property-by-property basis.Not sure why your, "".. emails to them bounce back.."" ??...Do you mean that you receive a '..Mailer Daemon..' message in your e-mail in box notifying you that your e-mail couldn't be sent or received ??...OR...do you mean that you don't receive a corresponding response to your e-mail ??For what it's worth...perhaps at this point, picking up the telephone and giving them a call might be best--+1 (441) 238-3577"
"So are all the other passengers off the first Delta flight being quarantined I wonder? Bermuda News said there were 47 passengers, 2 tested positive. What happens to the rest of those people on that plane?"
">>>...What happens to the rest of those people on that plane?...<<<According to a report in this morning's Royal Gazette,"".. it is a testament to our stringent testing regime that we were able to identify these individuals early and move to quarantine all passengers with public health monitoring.."" What this actually means , isn't quite so clear (??).""..Two positive virus tests off Atlanta flight..""--(Royal Gazette--June 08, 2020)royalgazette.com/health/article/20200707/two…"
"Yes KDKSail, I’ve read both those articles which don’t really address the quarantine issue. What I found most interesting was the comments made about both articles (which can be found if you scroll down past the article itself) by readers of both papers. I’m assuming most of the commentors are Bermudian, and they are for the most part as confused as the rest of us. Some say all are quarantined while others say they are out and about enjoying their vacation. I sure would like to know what really is going on. I’ve got reservations the first week in October and am about 99.9% sure I won’t be going. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Bermuda shut down again by that time unfortunately. What a sad state of affairs this is."
I should have clarified that there are articles in both the Royal Gazette and also Bermuda News.
"The two which tested positive are ""island residents."" Residents are NOT REQUIRED to take the pre - board Covid-19 test.We have reservations for October. I have a strong feeling we will be cancelling."
Did they publish the results of the Tuesday flight from Atlanta yet?
"Just published in Bernews:Today there were 220 test results received and one was positive for Covid-19, with the new case “imported on the Delta flight from Atlanta on 7th July 2020.”A Government spokesperson said, “Today there were 220 test results received by the Ministry of Health, and one was positive for Covid-19.“The new case was imported on the Delta flight from Atlanta on 7th July 2020."
It appears that there is a daily Covid-19 briefing report every day in late-afternoon/early-evening...so look for any Covid-19 updates there.
And now Elbow Beach Hotel has announced it will remain closed until next year.
BermudaBum - could I ask where you found this info on Elbow Beach?
It was a FB post by either Bernews or the RG. Forgot which one.
Thanks for the info. I wonder if the other “big” hotels like the Hamilton Princess and the Southampton Princess will follow suit?
"Targeted opening date on the hotel's website is 9/1/2020. ""Due to this precautionary measure and knowing our guests prefer to be ""out and about"" on our wonderful island, Elbow Beach Bermuda will close temporarily. This closure is in effect from Sunday, March 22 to Monday, August 31, 2020.""This matched the targeted date on the BTA's website also.Do you have a link you can post showing the date is moving to next Spring? Just curious.Edited: 11:34 am, July 12, 2020 "
"I found it by doing a search for ""Bermuda News Facebook"" . I'll attempt to attach a link to the sitehttps:/…"
"This is the direct link to the announcement appearing on the TNN--BDA web site this morning--""..ELBOW BEACH THROWS IN TOWEL ON 2020 TOURIST SEASON..""--(TNN--BDA--07/12, 2020)https:/…"
Thanks!
Old target was September 1. The news is out on all Bermuda media outlets.
"Hamilton Princess cancelled our August 1. 2020 reservations. They delayed their original opening date to August 23, 2020."
"...and the report in today's Royal Gazette about the Elbow Beach Hotel remaining closed until 2021--""..Elbow Beach to stay shut until 2021..""--(royal Gazette--07/13/2020)royalgazette.com/tourism/article/20200713/el…I wouldn't be at all surprised to read reports of other Bermuda hotel and guest accvommodation properties, that had tentatively announced re-opening this year to change their minds and remain closed until next year.Most professional hotel owner/managers are of the belief that just about any hotel or guest accommodation in Bermuda will lose money this year...whether they remain closed or re-open. The only question is whether they will lose even more money if they re-open (??)...with severely curtailed or reduced air service capacity and so many potential visitors unable or unwilling to fly under Covid-conditions (??) making it even more UN-profitable to operate."
"Regarding the continued closure of Elbow Beach ,tourists should be aware that a very popular Ocean front restaurant,Mickey's Beach Bistro,which is part of the property will also be closed.One of the better seaside restaurants in Bermuda,it will surely be missed until next season.Options appear to be shrinking for a very successful season with attempting to get flights,Covid red tape,and the unknown about hotels being open."
"You may recall that MICKEY'S BEACH BISTRO, located down on the sand at the Elbow Beach Hotel, has always been a '..seasonal..' attraction (usually open only from approx. mid-April-thru-October). The CAFÉ LIDO, indoor dining venue, on the terrace above was a year 'round operation."
"So sad, Love Mickey's."
"It may not be just Mickey's (??) . Other hotels that've announced proposed re-openings during July, August or September may decide to change their plans and remain closed. Severely reduced air service (fewer flights, fewer seats and fewer backsides in 'em) , travel restrictions. reluctance of even Bermuda's biggest and most loyal repeat visitor fans to travel, and any number of factors may make 'em change their minds about reopening. '..staycations..' specials for local residents ain't gonna' make up the difference. Bermuda has done an absolutely great job in limiting the transmission rate of Covid-19...but the actual '..travelin' ..'to get there and back can't make anywhere near to the same claim."
"Pompano is getting creative offering a club type membership. For a fee, residents can use their facilities. There are restrictions, but it includes golf, pool, gym, spa discount,... I wonder if other properties may do this as well?"
