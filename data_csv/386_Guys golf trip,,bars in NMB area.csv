"Wild Wing Cafe in Barefoot Landing,Putters Pub near the Barefoot courses and Liberty Tap Room if your playing in Myrtle Beach. BTW what is HHEdited: 10:03 am, February 14, 2020 "
"HH - Happy HourHere is a list of some places in the NMB area. scweekend.com/north-myrtle-beach-happy-hour-…You all would enjoy going to Rip Tydz on the Boardwalk in Myrtle Beach. Really nice multi-level bar. Lots of TV's good food, probably good HH.Edited: 10:38 am, February 14, 2020 "
"Here is another place that we have been numerous times. Nick's New York Pub. On Hwy 17 in NMB close to 2nd Ave north. Dive-like place, very good food.https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Revie…They also have a FB page."
"A couple others for ya. Boardwalk Billy’s, Molly Darcy’s , Flynn’s Irish Tavern, Oscars."
Another good place to watch sports is the Hickory Tavern https://www.thehickorytavern.com Tons of TV's Flynn's as mentioned above is a favorite for groups of golfers. For HH I think Boardwalk Billy's and The Flying Fish have great options.
We like Molly Darcy's.
Also Chucks Steakhouse is known for their Happy Hour and good food and drinks
"Some of the bars listed are a pretty far drive. In NMB Molly Darcy's and Flynn's on Main Street are good and there is a Buffalo Wild Wings in that area. A little further south, around Barefoot Landing, is Oscar's, Taco Mundo and Nacho Hippo."
"Plus the places in Barefoot Landing. Some new ones just opened up. We like Flying Fish and Greg Norman's Aussy Grill. There is a new mexican place where T-Bones used to be. Crabby Joes, Wild Wings. But you are staying furthur north than NMB although 31 makes it easy to bypass traffic. We also like Molly Darcy's. Right on ocean."
"If you have a DD, Grumpy Monk is great. Food is amazing, HH is fair price, and lots of TVs"

"Thanks everybody. Had to cancel everything because of CoViD-19. We are Canadian and borders are closed. Fortunately we got our money back from Airbnb,Rental Cars, Flights, Tee times. Will try next year same time"
Molly Darcy's has outdoor seating which is critical right now. And Sanabel next door is a nice place to stay.
"Moderators, please close this post, OP has received information and has canceled to MB due to COVID-19"
