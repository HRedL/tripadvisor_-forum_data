"The summer season on the cape and the islands is looking mighty bleak this year. At what point will they tell short term renters that we are not welcome, and just give us a refund. We plan and save all year for our one week at the cape, we reserve our spot at the same cottage in early January with a cash deposit. We do not pay all that money to be told we cant leave our unit, we can't shop for groceries or use the beach. Thoughts? Has anyone contacted the owners or managment of their short term rentals about the out look for this summer or the other way around?"
If you had booked with me all you would have to do is ask for your refund. I would think that most short-term-rental owners would do the same. Have you asked them?
"I was curious about this as well since the balance of the deposit is due tomorrow for our mid-August rental. I have not heard from the rental agency and there is nothing posted on their website so I will give them a call but wondered what policies others had encountered. I understand things will be very different this year but if we cannot even go sit on the beach, clearly we will have to rethink our plans. Be safe everyone."
"No yellowbird I have not, I am ready to give up on our only vaction this year, or give up our week and not be able to get it in the future."
"I know of one innkeeper on the Cape who is not refunding deposits. The vacationer who asked for his deposit back was told no, if you don't come you lose your money. Someone I know in Provincetown who rents a condo is refunding deposits. I think that the first one will lose business in the long run."
We have a house booked for Aug. 1 through VRBO. The owner told us that we had until July 1 to decide if we want to keep the reservation. No need to pay the second part of the rental until then. That was about a month ago. Short-term rentals are still banned in Massachusetts so we'll see what the next two months bring. If we don't go we will be refunded the deposit.
"That should read I am NOT ready to give up on vacation yet. And I am afraid to ask, if the owner says no, and holds us to the lease my husband will never want to go back there. We are booked for July 11 it is coming up fast."
I really hope things will be opened back up in July. If our beaches are closed my husband will lose his sh*t so let's all pray. lol.
"TMB -- really?? You ask strangers here but are afraid to ask the owner? I'm an owner -- your best bet is to contact them directly, immediately and express your concerns. You might find that reading the terms of your contract would be instructive as to your rights to cancel.No one know what will happen, but an open honest discussion with your host will be a darn good first step."
"Our contract states that a refund will only be given only if the unit is rerented at the same rate, which of course will not happen if the there is no or limited access to the beaches and other areas of the cape. We can ask for a refund but right now she would have no obligation to give one. We will come if we are not placed under quantine, we sociall distance now, we wear masks in public, not have visitors etc, but we so go out side, walk and shop for food & other necessities etc. It will depend if the Governor extends the stay at home order. They are going to have to pull the bandage off the scab and make decision. If the beaches are closed during our rental period we will ask for a refund."
"I hope this doesn't sound like a silly question but we have to travel THROUGH Massachusetts to get to our vacation spot. Our initial plan was to spend an overnight in a Massachusetts hotel as it's such a long drive but obviously wouldn't be staying for a 14 day quarantine. Are we okay to travel through the State to get to another State if we aren't stopping for an overnight? Thanks all, stay well."
yes
"You need to ask the owner directly. I suspect they would give you a refund given the circumstances. It is going to be a quiet summer on the Cape. If you cannot bear and restrictions, and I suspect there will be some, perhaps you should stay elsewhere. Maine is far less impacted by COVID than Mass. The taxpayers of the Cape, whoa re largely elderly, are not eager to have things wide open."
"Maine currently has strict restrictions in place for out-of-state visitors, to the point that we are questioning whether we will be able to vacation during our week at the end of August in Bar Harbor. Currently, their plan requires anyone from out-of-state to spend 14 days in quarantine once they reach Maine - no visits to shops, stores, or restaurants, even for take out. As a local destination expert said, ""why would you come if you can't leave your rental?""The Governor has said that the plan will be re-evaluated as data about Maine cases comes in over the months ahead. We're keeping our fingers crossed about our rental.Because they haven't been as severely impacted as other states, they are implementing plans to keep it that way. I'm keeping tabs on development through the Maine Forum. As you said about the Cape, C-T, people in Maine ""are not eager to have things wide open.""Edited: 7:37 pm, May 01, 2020 "
There is also a 14 day quarantine in Mass at present. These small towns both in Maine and Mass don't have adequate public safety personnel and there are no close hospital resources. Not a great place for crowds right now.
"TMB -- you're not gonna like this, but...""Our contract states that a refund will only be given only if the unit is rerented at the same rate, which of course will not happen if the there is no or limited access to the beaches and other areas of the cape. We can ask for a refund but right now she would have no obligation to give one.""Now you know what travel insurance if for. When you reserve a property and bind yourself to an agreement, you can spend some money to insure against a loss like this one -- or if say, there is a death or illness in the family. You took a chance and lost. This is not the owner's fault. That said, many many owners are giving refunds. I'm an owner, and I gave 100% refunds. Not everyone can afford to do that. But your owner may surprise you. Here's my advice -- contact the owner, explain that you may not be able to come (she knows that already) and suggest a compromise. Ask if she would consider a 50% refund or perhaps apply 50% toward next year. She may. No owner enjoys making money on someone else's misery. But the longer you wait, the less likely she will be to give you a break.""If the beaches are closed during our rental period we will ask for a refund.""Again -- ask now. And keep in mind that if the beaches are closed or there is an order not to travel -- none of these reasons are grounds for you to be able to cancel your agreement. The owner has no obligation to get you to the home -- and your contract does not even address your ability to occupy the home. So -- you may lose the price paid for a vacation. You may not get a vacation this year. (Join the crowd -- that's the least of our worries these days.) You might wonder if it is responsible for you to travel to MA and perhaps bring the virus back to sleepy Litchfield county. This is no fun -- but if that's all you lose in this mess, consider yourselves lucky."
"Loon, couldn't agree with you more, call the owners, have a conversation ."
I agree with talking with the owner. We need to remember that short-term rentals are still illegal in Mass. Until that order is lifted no one can rent rooms or homes. Better to talk to the owner ASAP.
"LMM, if Baker's order persists into the OPs rental period then the property is not available for a stay. In that case I would expect that full refunds will be given. If , on the other hand, the property IS available then, yes, to all you've said."
"I think that the order will be extended in some form, with partial reopening of stores, restuarants etc wth far fewer numbers of patrons allowed.. I think that there will be enforced social distancing on beaches this summer by limiting the numbers allowed on beaches."
"Right now the order ends May 18th almost 8 full weeks before the begining of our rental period. I cant imagine that anyone is going to give a definite answer before that. We wait will untill then. At some point state and local governments are going to Sh**t or get off the pot. I am not going to give up on my vaction yet, sorry if you think that is shallow."
"CCC. It does not really matter who or what prevents the guest from using the property -- according to the contract. If Charlie says you can't come, then the guest should take the matter up with the governor. I know this sounds harsh -- but it's the law, If the owner would open the door for the guest if they appeared, the owner has satisfied the agreement. The governor does not have authority to cancel a contact between these parties. Bad news for the guest who chose not to buy insurance."
"TMB, ""I am not going to give up on my vaction yet, sorry if you think that is shallow.""I don't think it is shallow. No. I said what I think -- and that is -- your best bet on a refund is to speak with the owner now. In your case, I would contact the owner ASAP and explain that you really want to come, but you don't know if you will be able to. And if you want to wait a bit longer for more direction from the government, etc. tell the owner just that. ""Hey, this is tricky... let's stay in touch, let me know what you're thinking..."" You could put it in writing, so you control your message... say as much as you want... as little as you want. But, trust me, EVERY OWNER knows that their guests are struggling with these choices. It's your call. I think we have covered all the bases. Good luck... stay well.LMM"
"LMM, are you sure that if the state or town prohibits short-term rentals, one is still bound by the contract? Both the owner and the renter would be breaking the law. I would think the owner would have more liability in this case. Not sure why the OP doesn't want to talk to the owner. It can't be the first conversation he/she has had about the issue."
"LMM offers a lot of free legal advice, which is worth what you paid for it. One could just as easily argue that a legally unexecutable contract should be voided as should a contract without a force majeure clause. If the owners do hold on to your deposit, I would say a visit to small claims court is worth a shot. But again that is free legal advice from the internet...The best thing to do is talk to the owner. As a vacation rental owner, I find it ridiculous that some owners think they have a right to anyone's money at this time."
"Ting, I'm pretty darned sure. This is a situation where neither the owner nor the guest is at fault. When the agreement was executed, the owner started performing immediately by not selling it to someone else. I'm not sure who has the greatest liability in the event the guest used the home is the measure as to who should benefit, or who should be allowed to alter the contract. The OP in this case has so far ignored the question as to why she did not buy travel cancellation insurance -- a product specifically designed to cover the loss from the guest.TinP -- yeah, free advice. Before you decide to further disparage me, please remember that (as I said earlier) I have given all my guests 100% refunds... and it's not because I had to, I chose to. And, I'm not taking a side here. It may seem that I don't care about the owner's situation, but the reality is I don't care either way. I'm trying to provide counsel. Any while you might think free advice is worth what you paid for it, I'm pretty familiar (as you should also be) with the contracts that most guests sign. You are correct that the owner may find a judge who feels sorry for the guest. I rather doubt it since it will be in a Mass courtroom with a local owner who is on the brink of losing her business versus an out-of-towner who failed to protect her purchase.We do agree however that the OP should contact the owner sooner than later. I wonder if the owner reads this forum and has figured out that this is her guest, initials TMB, about 58 years old and is awaiting a call. ;)"
"LMM- I have looked at the lease I use for my rental, (which I admit is free boilerplate I got from the internet and we know what that is worth), and I don't see where this specific situation is covered. If MA won't allow short-term rentals, the tenant is not cancelling so the cancellation clause doesn't apply. They could show up at the rental on the specified date and say ""Where's my key?"" and the landlord is out of luck because they can't legally give it to them. The only other clause that could apply is if the house becomes uninhabitable due to fire or other event. In this case the lease is null and void and the tenant receives a full refund. But MA banning short-term rentals doesn't make a house uninhabitable so that clause is a stretch. If a contract doesn't specify what happens during a certain contingency and that contingency arises, it is usually voided. Again, this is the lease I use and the OP's lease could be different. Does the lease you use cover such a situation?"
"TinP -- Contracts are written to protect the authors. So guests often just sign and cross their fingers. My contract does not give a guest any added rights in the event of any kind of disaster. They rely on my decision to help them and be fair. So far, that's worked out well for my guests. I purposely do not put in everything that could happen to a home that would render it inhabitable. It would scare guests away. But, I do take care of problems when they occur. The OP is being silly. I know a lot of owners, and when we can, we give refunds. She should contact the owner. These days, the poor owners on the Cape are facing losing their businesses.I will confess that I have more empathy for them than for people who may have paid for a vacation they'll not get to enjoy and chose not to insure their purchase from an unexpected loss."
"LMM, no travel insurance, with the exception of the Cancel For Any Reason policies, covers cancellations due to a pandemic. It just doesn't. The Cancel For Any Reason policies are prohibitively expensive. Few people purchase it unless they have a personal situation where the risk of having to cancel is high i.e. a sick relativeHaving said all that, I buy travel insurance when I plan a trip, but it would not have covered cancellations due to Covid-19."
"I thought short term rentals were banned on the Cape for now?I don't really see faulting guests for ""chose not to insure their purchase from an unexpected loss."" being any more valid than faulting hosts choosing not to insure against an unexpected ability to provide that purchase.They both sound absurd to me but I wouldn't apply a double standard if I was to fault someone for not having insurance."
"LMM- I know the purpose of contracts. And I disagree with the idea that guests sign and cross their fingers. You didn't answer my question. Does your contract dictate what happens when you are legally unable to rent your unit? I'm guessing not. If a contract does not describe what happens in a situation, the contract is voided. Judges hate to have to deal with poorly writtten contracts and often just throw them out when litigated. This is why every contract you sign with major companies include an arbitration clause in case of dispute. They know that the courts don't want to deal with their contractual mistakes."
"Well, I'm tired of defending an unpopular position. If any of you learn of a case where the guest prevails, come on back and prove me wrong. Again, I have no skin in this game... rather I want the OP to have a clear view of what she can expect to happen.Bonnie -- I cannot think of any insurance product that does not have different levels of coverage. I guess most people would not buy the premium product anticipating the unexpected.TinP. I did answer your question: ""My contract does not give a guest any added rights in the event of any kind of disaster.""I take good care of my guests and I have never come close to a courtroom or legal action. Like I said -- I've given full refunds without any complaining or negotiating. My contract is intentionally brief. As a fellow owner, you might be familiar with owners who write seven-page agreements that are so complicated the guest just says ""Screw it"" and rents elsewhere.Edited: 6:08 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"I didn't ask about disasters or added rights. I asked if your contract specifically describes what happens if you are legally unable to rent your unit. If it does not, you are not ""protected"" at all. By signing the contract as a landlord, you are agreeing to supply a house for use by the tenant. If you can't do that, for whatever reason, you have broken that contract. It doesn't matter what the reasons are, who's right or whose fault it is. You cannot complete your side of the contract. Maybe your contract has a clause for what happens in that case, but I doubt it. That would require one of those 7 page leases you spoke of. I'm sure you're an conscientious landlord and I never said otherwise. But your opinion on who's protected in this specific situation is wrong. I hope if anyone on these boards has had their vacation leases cancelled and deposits kept because of the MA ban on short-term rentals, they check their lease to see if the landlord even had the right to. It is unlikely the lease describes this situation and if it doesn't the landlord has no right to their money."
"Okay, you've made both of your points -- that you think I'm wrong -- and that free advice is worth what I paid for it.Stay well."
"I think we're all looking at this the wrong way. The real question is, under what circumstances will private rental properties be allowed to reopen? Will they have to strictly limit the total number of guests? Will beaches (both public and private) have strict maximum capacity & social distancing limitations that are strictly enforced by beach patrols? Will vacationers be required to quarantine in their rental property for two weeks? Will restaurants and retail shops be open to locals only?While I imagine we *might* be able to salvage the second half of the summer (from around July 4th onwards) if the stars align, strict rules and regulations will need to protect vacationers from each other and prevent new outbreaks of COVID-19. Not to mention a lot of public gatherings on the Cape will be cancelled this year. Worst of all, if a bunch of vacation spots rush to open as quickly as possible with little regard for public safety, it will all but invite new COVID-19 outbreaks that could shut down the whole summer."
"Similar situation and trying to get a feel for what local residents think about this. I have been in contact with the place we rent (also for many years) and thankfully they have been very flexible with us so far. As much as we want to keep our plans and give the cape our biz, if my situation was less flexible I probably would have cancelled already esp knowing that some owners/rental agents may be citing vague rental contract language as a reason to not refund deposits. Seeing mixed messages on various forums about whether residents feel the Cape can safely handle influx of short term renters this summer even if they lift the current restrictions. We are pretty low key so would be fine without the big events and take out or cooking ourselves, but it will come down to whether beaches will be open and if we feel we can still enjoy them and other activities safely. Decision needs to be made soon, trying to be optimistic but reality is likely different. Stay well everyone."
"Okletsgo, It's my guess that local residents would be delighted to have the Cape all to themselves in the summertime. Just one of the regular posters here gains income from summer visitors I believe. So you may get feedback here that is less enthusiastic than need be.Note too that the towns are treating beach closures differently. I believe the Yarmouth beaches just reopened. So check with the town where you stay.BTW what other forums are you referencing please : ""mixed messages on various forums"""
"CCC, I can see with those who are retired or have second homes on the Cape might like having it to themselves in the summer. The year-round residents who derive a good portion of their income from tourists might think differently. I wonder if you have any sources that say otherwise. Even if restaurants have to have take-out only, for instance, it might be the difference between their staying in business and closing forever."
I don't live on the Cape but I know what I think of tourists coming to Boston right now and know I am not able to predict how I will feel about them in the future because I don't know what the State of several others things will be in the future.I don't think there's anything unique about the Cape in this regard and I assume you can answer your question by asking if you'd welcome tourists to your town in the future and I would assume also that your answer would be that you can't accurately predict that future.
"I don't have a dog in this fight but the fact is most people think that there will not be enough tourism this year, anywhere, for much money to be made. Really far fewer people than usual will travel. Restaurants cannot survive on takeout. Most of them that are doing it want to keep their people employed as best they can. With no liquor, especially, it is a losing proposition over the long run. And everyone is aware of the lack of health care on the Cape. Many of you don't realize how many people go off-cape for their car. There are only two hospitals on the whole Cape. And the population of the Cape is the oldest on average of any part of New England. Can you understand why there might be some ambivalence about opening wide to tourists?"
"We are still booked for 2 weeks mid July. Our final payment is due June 1st, I’m hoping there will be more answers by then. Our rental is beachfront and we have no problem staying put for the duration of our vacation Fingers crossed!"
"Look, I have a rental for a month in July on the Cape. I intend to go. I can self isolate as easily there as I can in Cambridge. If we can't go to restaurants, I'll be sad, because I am really sick of cooking. but I'll get by on take out."
"Cambridgtravler, re: your post #39. Boy were we surprised to learn that the next town over from us is allowing their restaurants to offer 'to go' liquor sales. We got marguaritas at one place and sangria at another. Many restaurants are offering full bottles of wine for sale ( I don't get that ) and one restaurant is including a bottle of wine as a free perk. Still have to give them a try.I think I heard that Texas (don't know where) is also allowing take out liquor and said that they may decide to make that permanent.As you say, so much of the restaurant revenue is from the drinks."
"CCC, the state law about restaurants selling take out liquor changed a couple of weeks ago. You do have to buy food though. Boston is allowing it in an effort to help restaurants stay afloat. Also restaurants here can now sell grocery products."
Well one of the Mexican restaurants here has a family package and they include.....toilet paper...lol. Similar but not as funny is the local brewery now offers a side of hand sanitizer.What kind of grocery items are the restaurants selling that won't compete with their take out operations?How are the restaurants packaging their liquor options and I wonder if that is spreading to the Cape any time soon.
"I think the restaurants are selling produce and bread. Things that they would usually be buying from their suppliers. This is new and I don't know how many restaurants are doing it.I haven't bought liquor with a takeout meal but one restaurant nearby is selling bloody mary's in a Mason jar to go with your takeout brunch. Others are selling a bottle of wine, or a four- or six-pack of beer to go with dinner. One stop shopping!"
"Hi all. As most of you know, I am a full-time, 32-year resident on Outer Cape with a lodging business that caters to summer tourists. So yes, I have been following discussions about opening the economy closely. At the moment there is a Cape Cod coalition working with the state government to figure out if/when/how to conduct a summer season on the Cape. Many of the popular events and venues will remain closed: Cape League Ball Games, Live Theater Productions, Movie Theaters, Festivals, Themed weeks in Provincetown, and basically anything where groups of people come together...except for beaches. I think that is to be determined based on the data.I do not have knowledge of the discussions but I would bet that short-term rentals of single units that do not share common areas with other rentals may be approved under certain circumstances. So home/cottage/cabin rentals might be allowed to open under certain circumstances. I would imagine that larger resorts, hotels and large Inns might have restrictions on the number and density of their guests but I can't imagine an out-and-out ban on STRs for the entire summer would be enforced. But again...I'm guessing. If the statistics do not indicate that the Cape can handle an influx of visitors I hope the closures stay in effect. People on vacation from states that have already opened their economies, may or may not understand Massachusetts's high rate of positive cases and the need for strict testing and adherence to the state/local mandates. Like many seasonal vacation areas, businesses here depend on seasonal workers. Restaurants and lodging businesses, as well as retail businesses, can not operate at full capacity without outside helpers. Mandates for safe distancing and wearing masks in public places will most likely stay in effect all summer even if the 14-day quarantine for out-of state visitors is lifted. But again...I'm guessing.Personally, if allowed to host guests, we will honor our current reservations as long as we can rearrange the timing of some reservations to ensure 3 days between guests to allow for airing, cleaning, and safety. We will not be providing prepared breakfasts or interacting in person with our guests to ensure that safe self-distancing issues are moot. If our scheduled guests decide to cancel within our revised 7-day period prior to arrival, we will give refunds or reschedule depending on the guest's requests. These are exceptional times."
"Regarding post #41 - Getting take-out and eating at the condo doesn't work at all for me. The highlight of my time in Provincetown is going to a restaurant, such as Fanizzi's or the Red Inn, being waited on, enjoying the views of Cape Cod Bay as I eat and in general being pampered. More physical activities from past years such as nature trails and long walks are out because of declining health (too many hard parachute landings). I canceled until possibly next year if I can make it."
"I have a reservation in p town that I made and paid 50% upfront. As of today, May 10th, my reservation begins on May 16th, I have gotten no reply from the owner. I have emailed and called the hotel, the chamber of commerce and the tourism departments. Still no reply. Unfortunately, I'm so upset about the way I've been treated even ""if"" I do get my deposit back I will not stay there again. The way I see it, I did not cancel, the state closed them down, that's not my fault."
"The only analog I can offer is that of those who were impacted by all the COVID orders and changes during the ski season. Many folks with short term rentals were not able to use them due to emergency orders banning them mid-season. We had a condo rental for 4 months, paid in full in December. Short-term rentals were banned mid-season and the mountain closed, as did restaurants and everything else. Out-of-state cars were getting vandalized in parking lots and license plates were being documented at the borders. We spoke to the owner of our condo - who also lives out of state and cannot access her own unit - and no refund for the remaining 7 weeks of our paid stay was given. It was no small amount of money but no one could have ever anticipated this type of thing. Everyone is losing out right now."
"Thanks for your reply CCC. I will check with the town. I found some FB groups and there was a heated discussion under an article posted on local paper page (CC Times?). Came here to ask because I know from past exp people in this forum are helpful. I really do not have a good feel as a tourist of how the summer could look once they make decisions about what will e open and how. We all know it will be an off season and could be quiet, which is fine with us, but also see people in other states that reopened early flocking to beach towns in big crowds and that concerns me. I think a lot will depend on how MA updates its current order. Less crowded better for social distancing but not for businesses. I understand mixed feelings by residents and do not want to risk our health or anyone else. We are taking all precautions here including wearing masks and will continue to as long as necessary. Another concern is cleaning between guests. I know there is a good chance we will need to cancel this year but for now a lot of people in limbo on both sides."
"Okletsgo and Yellowbird,My cleaner has sent out info from the CDC that states that the property be unoccupied for 24 hours at the end of each rental after which his cleaners can go in.Meantime our realtor has sent all the home owners a letter, just Friday, with distilled CDC info. The guidelines they have been given do not require single family vacation rentals to be empty for 24 hours. They have instituted a more rigorous cleaning schedule and, to accommodate, they have moved check-in from 2pm to 4pm and are charging guests an additional $25. cleaning fee or more for 4 or 5 bedroom homes...can't recall which in order to meet the new cleaning standards.Edited: 12:13 pm, May 10, 2020 "
"The governor will make an announcement early this week about next steps and whether the shutdown will extend after the 16th. By the end of the week there will be a clearer picture. If my rental was not waterfront I would not be as optimistic about spending time there, Howland. We are not really beachgoers anymore (bad knees are really bad on sand)but don't need to be at our rental, were we can be outdoors and just enjoy the view and the breeze.. And guests who want the beach have easy access just down the street. We are close to a well stocked local market and don't have to go to a supermarket."
"CCC that may be the CDC guidance but for the time being there are no short term rentals for vacationers allowed in MA, that means Cape Cod. There will be an update on May 18 but for now, only if the lodging is for essential personel or for longer than 30 days should anyone be renting their property. Additionally, anyone coming into MA from another state must quarantine for 14 days. There is a ton of information on the state website: https://www.mass.gov/resource/information-on…Edited: 5:03 pm, May 10, 2020 "
"Yes, Yellowbird, I am aware of the short term vacation rental rules however the realtor must be expecting for those to be lifted. Otherwise all the rest is moot.Meantime IL lags MA and we will have to see if and when we will be allowed to travel. We have been in lock down until the end of May for a while and Gov sounds like he wants any excuse to extend it. Feel really sorry for the downstate IL people who have few or no cases.Edited: 5:35 pm, May 10, 2020 "
"I imagine this is a huge disappointment, and you should receive your refund. As a Cape Codder things are not going to be the same for anyone. Our numbers of the virus keep climbing, there's barely groceries in some of the stores and many other issues. I think most importantly we all need to think about how can the Cape accommodate all the tourist and still keep it safe. Our medical facilities are limited a,nd I still can not get in to see my primary doctor.For sure there are other states that are less crowded and more than likely can handle the influx.Good luck,"
"Allyb, I totally appreciate your perspective but I am finding groceries, sufficiently. Dennis Public Market, Ring Brothers, Market Basket are doing a fabulous job, stocking up. S and S has not had paper goods for a month or so and other products seem to be sparse. Personally, I avoid S and S like the plague. Rory's Market also has great supply of organic produce and more. Most are delivering or have curbside. I want to provide an accurate portrayal of the situation, mid Cape and at Market Basket.Edited: 4:56 pm, May 20, 2020 "
"Chakita, do you mean that you shop at Rory's in Mashpee or is there another?"
"I live in Dennis so shop at Rory's in Dennisport, why?"
"I never heard of Rory's and when I looked it up I saw only a Mashpee location. I like to shop in Dennis too.Oh, is it the place on the corner sort of opposite the Barber Shop? Isn't the name different now?Edited: 2:52 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"Regarding the regulations for short-term rentals on Cape Cod. There is currently a Task Force working on regulations and we should know more at the end of the week. You can check our state senator's site for updates. https:/…Until we get official word about Phase 2 regulations, everything is speculation. I suspect that, since the latest research shows that the virus is mostly transferred from person to person and not so much from contact with surfaces, that airing and disinfecting will be in the protocol. For safety's sake, we will be leaving at least 2 days between rentals along with whatever protocols are required by law."
Re: post 59 - I meant that I guess Rory's is the new name but same owners right Chakita?
I rented a house in West Dennis for 5 nights in July and we're hoping for the beaches and restaurants to be open. We'll still go even if things don't open because the view looking out at the water is better than the view at my house. We don't plan on going out to eat much while we're down there but it would be nice to have the option to go out if we wanted.
All these years I never knew that https:/… offered full seafood dinners to go. This is not a recommendation since we haven't tried them yet but a neighbor has been going there for a few years. They are located in South Yarmouth just west of the Bass River bridge on Rt 28.Clancy's on Upper County has a big menu. Nothing there is gourmet but we like Pasta with Clam sauce and Chicken Kari Ann. Check their hours as I saw something stating that they may have to limit days of operation due to lack of staff.Of course Kreme n Kone are open for the season. Cleat and Anchor is available now for take out and they seem to have an expanded menu.For some delicious dining however I wonder if The Ocean House or The Oyster Co.will be offering take out. Worth a call for sure Ginny.Paradise Pizza may be your closest pizza shop on School St.Those are a few if you need some ideas.
"Here is a link to a lengthy Cape Cod Times Article - ""Numerous Changes for Cape The Summer Due to COVID-19"":https://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20200523/n…"
"OP here. We did contact the owner of our rental unit, she feels that short term rentals will be available in July and expects she will be able to rent it, she is not offering refunds at this time. We are planning to go on vaction the 11 th of July as scheduled.. If on June 8th the state of Massachusetts does not ease up on the lodging prohibitions and the quarantine orders will revisit it with her. We will not send the balance of our fee until we know we can go and have a vacation. I realize things will not be the same, but she thinks the town where we stay will honor the deeded right to the public beach that her property enjoys, and if they do we have every intetion of using it. We always bring a cooler of food with us but it absurd to think that you can bring everything you need with you, we will shop for food and beverages, and order take out if restaurant dining is not available.That said, the Sate of Massachusetts is going to have to make a decision. It is not fair to property owners, businesses or visitors to keep dragging this out. People still need to arrange time off, pet sitters and what have you, not everyone can say if I can't come in July I will come in August. If the powers of be do not feel it will be safe this summer to visit the cape then shut it down, mandate that all lodging, etc deposits be refunded and deal with the consequences."
"The State, like all of us, is unable to predict the future. And does not want to shut down the future when that may not be needed. And by the same token does not want to open up the future when that might be dumb.And this is about a lot more that tourists and property owners being impacted. Sorry but people arranging pet sitters is pretty far down the list of what matters."
"Hank, maybe you can give up a 50% deposit on. a vation rental and not sweat it, we can not. If we can not go on our contracted vacation we want to do somthing else this summer we would like out money back i. At some point the goverment is going to have to get off the probverbial pot"
"I'd sweat losing a penny.Not as much as I would living in a State that puts lives at risk, or totally disregards the tourist industry, by making guesses about the future though an committing based on a guess.This blows for everyone who'd be posting on a tourist site. But unfortunately there are many other things to consider and reasons not to commit to future policy.Edited: 4:25 pm, May 29, 2020 "
"The tourist situation on the Cape is low on the agenda of the governor. I hate to be unsympathetic, but it's true. It's entirely possible there will not be much of a tourist season I Massachusetts.https:/…download You can read the beach guidance here. This guidance will likely go on all summer."
I can get over not going to the cape this year. But shut it down already. This slow drip is ridiculous. Until there is a vaccine and a treatment we won’t feel totally safe. If that is the goal shut it down now. The same thing is happening here in CT. Barbers are told they can open 2 days later they can’t. Today we can gather in groups Of 45 yesterday day we couldn’t. The whole thing is frustrating
"I can cut the governor and the mayor of Boston a little slack. They have never had to deal with a pandemic before especially when it's been made clear that it's every state for itself. They want to prevent the positive tests for the virus from surging again. The only way to do that is to go slowly. There may be some steps forward and some steps back. It's hard not being able to reliably plan for the future, but that's the case for all of us right now. And many are worried about more than vacations. That is the real challenge. We can't predict next week, never mind the next three months."
I wish testing was more accessible. It's 160.00 at Carewell for a 24 return of results and included in my insurance but 48 hour wait time.
"ting, you mention how hard it is to plan, - my husband has been waiting for so-called elective surgery for some time. For those of you who know anyone in this situation, elective surgery includes surgeries very necessary for one's health. It is not plastic surgery or something, it is everything except a burst appendix or a heart attack. His surgery has been rescheduled over and over again. we were told in early May with some certainty it would be mid June. Now the phasing is up in the air again and we are told maybe August, maybe July, then maybe August again. Right now, parents don't know if their kids will be in school in September. I'm sorry for folks who are concerned about their vacations but take a look at the other issues first, please."
Sympathy for your husband and you too. Would it be possible for him to have the surgery in a nearby state any earlier?
"Charlie would you have surgery with a surgeon you had never met and a hospital you had never been to? How would you do follow up? And, if you were from Boston, why would you ever go anywhere else?"
I guess it depends on whether the wait would degrade my condition which could have negative ramifications. A couple of times I have taken my doctor's recommendation for another Doc in another specialty. Actually that's how I found my favorite. It all depends on your circumstances.
"Sorry Cambridgtravler--the waiting and uncertainty is more stressful than the surgery. I have a friend who had to go off the liver transplant list (because of a surgical procedure), and hopefully will go back on soon. As you say, no need to look at hospitals elsewhere when you're in Boston. I hope for both your sakes that your husband's surgery is scheduled sooner rather than later. All best."
"Cambridgetraveler, the ripples from this virus have gone far and wide and it looks like your husband got caught up in it. At least we avoided the tsunami and there is hope that with the recent improvements he can get in and get his issue taken care of. Wishing you peace of mind in the meantime."
