Spain delivers huge blow to British holidaymakers insisting Covid-19 ‘statistics must improve’ before they can return while welcoming German & Nordic tourists this summer
That's sadly true at the moment davhaz & I said more or less the same in this CDS thread on Post 21 & 26.....https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18743…
"davhaz, I hope Spain won't regret opening its borders to other countries. I would have thought there were enough Spaniards keen to holiday this summer to keep the tourism industry ticking over without risking a spike arriving from abroad. At over 27,000 tragic deaths and a higher death rate per million people than the UK, I don't think I'd take the risk. (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/spain?country=~ESP)"
Yep - cannot blame them. Looking at the idiots gathering at Trafalgar Sq or at the beaches over the weekend can only see the numbers getting worse.Bloody annoying as still hoping on coming over in July and had pretty much self isolated but the idiots will ruin it for everyone else
Are they all giving correct numbers out?For weeks our Government gave low numbers out by only giving NHS deaths.
"63joe, that's a good point. There's also a big difference between counting the deaths 'with' and the deaths 'from' the virus - anyway, even one death is too many. I think we're all agreed that this summer the British are better off staycationing.Edited: 6:03 am, June 01, 2020 "
"Post 3 ""For them to decide not to welcome Brits back just shows what they think of our figures.""""Not surprising in the least"" when you read stories like this....https:/…Such a shame!"
".There are quite strict rules about using the beaches in Spain, where they are open.Why haven't they done something similar in UK?Early during the Spanish lockdown we saw pictures of armed soldiers policing the lockdown, so people understood that it was serious. But in UK there were protests when Police stopped and fined people a paltry £60, reduced to £30 if paid within a few days. In Spain the fine was €600 for a minor breaking of the rules - people just buying beer and crisps in a supermarket, for example, as that wasn't considered essentials if bought on their own.So lack of willingness to ensure people kept to the rules has led to no rules being kept in UK, scenes as shown by Violette, and figures showing how serious it still is in UK.Keep safe everyone."
"Turista, you only had to look at the British tourists in Benidorm during the first days of lockdown in Spain to realise that some were never going to follow the guidelines in the UK. As usual though, the minority misbehaving gets everyone a bad name. They think rules and guidelines are for other people."
I wish we had called in armed soldiers as well!!
