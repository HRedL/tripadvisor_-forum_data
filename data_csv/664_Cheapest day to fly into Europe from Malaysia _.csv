"I’d like to travel from Malaysia to Europe.What are the cheapest routes and days to fly in and out for that?I surveyed KL would be one of the best airports in Malaysia for doing that, but all the flights I’m looking at are really expensive to go anywhere in Europe."
"look at www.skyscanner.net - many options and choices. Also, lots of other search engines will provide similar search options.Day of the week? Many airlines will show you flights on days of the week either side of your chose day/date. It can vary significantly - depending on demand.You need to consider CoVid and restrictions placed by the MCO and what is happening with CoVid in your destination country. Also, what MCO says about your flight home - you do not want to be stuck in Europe with no way home."
"Alright, thank you. Well, the earliest I would travel most probably next year but my main destination, for now, is UK, Italy and Greece so I would like to know which route or day to fly into will be cheaper. I read a lot that if UK departure date better is on Friday and try to avoid Sunday because it is most expensive so I would like to know what about fly-in?"
"I can tell you that the UK government and UK County Councils are planning for the CoVid virus to be on ONGOING problem during 2021.Until there is a viable vaccine, the virus will continue to cause problems with travel."
Looks like COVID 19 is getting serious now so better not to travel first. But thanks for telling me.Maybe will visit the UK some other years
"Where does this odd 'CoVid' affectation come from esorlegin?!COVID-19, CV-19, Coronavirus are all in common, informed usage...but CoVid?!?"
@ Whyone - petty and pointless comment. Picky and not travel related!
"There is enough confusion, misinformation and misunderstanding circulating regarding this pandemic already without people needlessly inventing new names for either the virus or the condition caused by the virus. So neither nit-picking nor pointless."
#7Very strange answer to an innocent question by a TA DE like yourself. Why?
"Oh.. I just realized you're writing from Kuching. Def fly through SIN. You'll find better flight options vs. KUL. Good luck! I responded through your other post. Use Flight Scanner or Google flights to find the best fares to Europe. I prefer Google flights, but it's probably because I've been using it for so many years and am use to it."
Thank you well i never used google flight before usually I use skyscanner.
"I agree with you EsorleginAnd since you are using skyscanner, it WILL tell you which day is the cheapest"
