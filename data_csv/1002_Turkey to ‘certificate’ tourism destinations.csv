"Wonder how this is going to work out in practice. Social distancing in hotels is going to be a difficult one, and how about use of hotel pools, will the pools be closed. Who knows. Rena"
"Tbh, I’m more concerned about spending 4hours in a plane, sharing germs with random others. Also getting travel insurance to cover COVID."
"This will all have to come in phases. My current estimate is that Turkey will begin loosening restrictions in the middle of May, and continue in stages through to the end of June. Of course, there will need to be changes to how we approach things that will last throughout. Then we'll all see how the new ""containment"" phase is working evrywhere, and if it's working, international travel will slowly begin to restart.All very tentative, all very contingent on a lot of ""ifs""."
"Trees1981, I wonder if you believe you are the only person to think, at all?"
"Not at all but you're recently been soooo negative. Take a break, smell some flowers or eau-de-cologne or something. :)In addition, while this virus will not go away until we find a vaccine (which is likely no earlier than the end of this year, and more probably well into 2021), we have all, I think, learned some lessons. As we're all stuck at home, we also lose track of time. The other day I woke up knowing that it was Friday. Only the lack of any movement outside made me realise that it might be Saturday. :) Similarly, measures taken a month ago seem as though they were taken last week, or conversely three months ago.What I'm trying to work around to saying is this: we know how to beat the virus, we know how to test for it, and we're all far better prepared and more vigilant than we were even four-five weeks ago. So, basically, we're all far more like South Korea. Who've kept their daily cases down to below 30 for a while. Once blood tests start becoming available in June, we'll also know more about just how widespread this thing is. And in the long term, there are literally hundreds of institutions working on a vaccine, perhaps 70 of which are serious places. There hasn't been anything like this since the fights against smallpox or polio, and our technical capabilities are far, far, far greater than they were then. (Or even compared to 20 years ago: it took 3 months to sequence the SARS gene in 2004; it took the Pasteur Institute 3 (maybe 4) days in 2020 for its cousin, this coronavirus.)I doubt we shall any of us have worry-free holidays in 2020 - if we have them at all! - but day by day the odds are rising in our favour. Too slowly for our liking, certainly, but this is not a sprint.May you all be well!"
"I am just tying holidays to when the social distancing rules are relaxed enough to reopen the pubs in this country and since its been mentioned that they are going to be one of the last things to open i can't see any holidays happening this season. hope i am wrong got a holiday to turkey booked for september.Edited: 9:59 am, April 20, 2020 "
"And this is being discussed by the same TC Government that hid the very existence of COVID-19 within Turkey, and still is not exactly transparent."
"I suppose you have a friend of a friend who read on a FB page that people were falling over dead on the streets and the reason why even the number of cats on the streets had dropped was because we had cross-infected them?Sorry, guys, I go off numbers, as well as my contacts, built up over decades, of doctors, nurses, businessmen and people who actually know Turkey. The one area where I'm not convinced is the number dead, which by general conclusion may be twice as high as reported.And, cagcag, what extra info do you want?"
