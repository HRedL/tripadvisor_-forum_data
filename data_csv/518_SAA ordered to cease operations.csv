I got this message today from the US Embassy. Looks very bad for SAA. Qatar Airways is no longer flying to S Africa? Please be safe everyone https:/…
I wonder why Qatar is no longer flying to South Africa? Is it temporary due to Covid-19 or permanent?
The State Department was paying for part of that flight to repatriate Americans. I hope it’s not forever but the airlines are in turmoil.
At the moment there are no passenger flights in South Africa apart from repatriation flightsThe UK had their last repatriation flight using Qatar last weekAs you say Cbir the airline industry is in turmoil. Hence the reason why I’m not planning any travel in 2020 and not booking anything for 2021 for a while but I expect prices to be much higher
"Last week? I know of someone who just left a volunteer organization this week, thought there was a UK flight. I hope they’re ok. NY is on day 66 of the lockdown. Most of the rest of the US is opening up. It’s quite an experiment. Good to hear from you Lisa. Our next international trip probably won’t be until 2022."
"SAA was in problems for a long time. Now that the government has decided not to support it anymore financially, the chances of getting back to air for commercial operations is very slim. Yet that does not mean those airplenes will not fly anymore. They will, just under a different logo/owner."

"Thanks QOD1. But yesterday the only flight scheduled was canceled - same flight going to US was to take S Africans home. And from the US Embassy notice I posted above, it doesn’t look like anything is scheduled or planned. What a mess I’m surprised how many people from all countries are scattered throughout the world. We have no idea Xelas. They’re hoping for a public/private partnership but nothing yet."
"South Africa is a nation big enough to have its own national carrier. I hope such will emerge from the present situation, sooner then later. Although present times are not in favour of any airline company."
"Agreed, South Africa is ""big enough"" to have national carrier. SAA started in 1934.It has a proud safety record and was an award winning airline,the second airline in the world to use jets (in the early 1950's, after BOAC).It used to be profitable, but unfortunately, has been in dire straits gor some time,due to nepotism and corruption.As I see it,any future ""national carrier"" MUST be a private organisation, totally free from government meddling. Either that, or a complete change of government, if any govt run enterprise is to be successful.(The same holds true for ALL state owned enterprises, like ESKOM and others)"
Thank you for sharing this important post. Our world sure has changed.
Union took SAA to courts and have won (so far)https:/…138295.article
How about Airlink (the domestic S Africa carrier) ? They are not part of SA Airlines. Any news of them ?? Thanks.
"Received this today. If you’re a US citizen (don’t know about legal residents) and want to be repatriated, here’s the latest info. It’s through SAAhttps:/…"
