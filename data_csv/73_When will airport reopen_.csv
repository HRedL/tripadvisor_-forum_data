Any new information about reopening and future Covid-19 testing?
"Nobody knows this, and currently decisions tend to be announced at the last minute. But there are currently discussions going on about how to open up. My best guess, and it's only a guess, is that they will write off the hurricane season and watch what is working with other islands that are opening up right now. So far, at least, SKN seems to have taken the most conservative approach of all of the islands, and it's working."
