I have a month long trip planned for July 2020 and I am in high hopes that I won’t have to cancel. As I had to cancel my flight/hotels last summer due to other person issues. Now I’m ready for this year and Corona happens! I will truly be devastated if my trip has to be canceled this year.Can anyone shed some positive light on my worries?Do you think Egypt will be handling more tourism during July 2020?If anything I just wanted to go to the north coast and swim. I’m not even interested in full tour of the country. Plus I have family to visit and stay with.
Fingers crossed for you but it's looking doubtful unfortunately as Egypt is suffering with a high number of COVID-19 patients.
"You may be lucky but I wouldn’t hold much hope for July. Coronavirus numbers are increasing, despite the government’s attempts many people are still gathering and going about their daily lives as though there is nothing to worry about!"
July is only a few weeks away. I don’t see any chance of a foreigner visiting Egypt before then in any remotely safe way.
