"Prologue – It’s February, so that means Vegas! We usually go for Super Bowl, but this year the room rates were a lot less for the following week, so we decided we could pass on SB and save the extra money for drinking and gambling. It was just S and me going this year, so no need to have set plans ahead of time. We are late, late, very late 50’s and early 60’s. Ok I’m 59 and ¾ and S is 61. We like to walk the strip, drink, low roller penny slot gamble and see the sights. I'll post as replies, my report is divided into categories, basically hotels/gambling and restaurants/drinking."
"Epilogue – We love Las Vegas. It has absolutely everything we like in a vacation spot. The weather was beautiful, a bit chilly-ish at night but not cold and rainy like last year, and sunshine every day. It still remains a fantastic value for us. We can eat and drink so cheaply there, even at some of the nicer places, with BOGO, Happy Hours, lunch instead of dinner, etc. It just takes a little effort and research to find what fits your needs.It was getting really busy on Thursday before we left, but we realized it was Valentine’s day weekend. There were tons of kids around then, too. Kind of wondered why kids were coming with to a romantic weekend but then remembered it was also President’s Day Monday, so school was probably out. Anyway, we want no part of VD in Vegas. Literally and figuratively.We got back home and, of course, immediately start looking at next year. We decided independently that we might like to go when it’s a tad warmer, so we discussed maybe March or April. In doing research we realized there’s March Madness, spring break, Easter, all sorts of events that we’d have to work around. So, in the end, Super bowl week it is. In fact, we are already booked at Bally’s for 2021. We have 5 comp nights with the other 2 at $50 each, I’m sure that will go down in time. And, the following weekend is full fledged Valentines, so no thanks. We have also been trying to decide where to go for my 60th in August, that’s not too pricey since it’ll be an extra trip this year. Looked at Tahoe, the bourbon trail, actually booked comp rooms in Tahoe. Then, in checking airfare, and hotel prices, saw we could go to Vegas for 4 nights for a total of $270 each. That is the airfare, we are booked at Planet Hollywood, 4 nights comped. That, plus the fact that we don’t need a car there like we would other places, plus reward credits we can use for food, made our choice easy, so we booked the trip yesterday. Woohoo, extra Vegas! Vegas can be done as cheaply or as pricey as you want it to be, just takes a little planning and research. It will be a trip that will have less gambling, but that’s ok, it will be summer and we can enjoy the sun and the warmth! We’ve been before in summer, know it will be HOT, but that’s ok! It’s Las Vegas, and we are always happy to be there!"
"Nice report. You seem to be overly concerned with money, though."
"Enjoyed your TR, especially after much depressing news! We are to go May 9th, so hoping we don’t have to cancel. How was the gambling?"
I enjoyed your trip report!Going in June hopefully.(if corona passes} for My 60 th !Where is Fuel Bar & Luke's Lobster Located ?
Wow! You did ALOT!! Thanks for all the info.....really great details! Interesting how you prefer Bally's over Paris.....I am the opposite. But that's why Vegas works for so many.....thanks for taking the time!
"Kathytemperance - we play mostly penny slots, some quarters. We did well at Paris and Bally's, and PH and Cosmo actually. I like to cash out tickets when I get a good hit, maybe $75 or more. We had several to cash out by the end of the trip, and came home with a little under a third of our bankroll. So it went well, I'd say."
"Cheermom - Fuel bar is at the Grand Bazaar shops in front of Bally's, it's in the back by Wahlburgers. Luke's Lobster is a tiny little stand in front of the Fashion Show mall. Both could easily be overlooked but are worth seeking out, to me."
Nice trip report :)
Thanks for your trip report. I loved all the detail but I did wish there were more gambling details. Glad you have a return trip scheduled.
Thanks for posting. Happy to read a pre-pandemic report. Hopefully more posters will find to time to recap their past trips so we all have something fun to read versus all the doom and gloom posts.
Your trip report made me very thirsty. Thanks for sharing.
Great TR. Very nice you took the time and care to share all of it. Oh and #4's comment comes from someone who doesn't relate well with others. Such a repetitive boor.
"Thanks for the nice comments everyone. Thankful we got our trip in when we did. I agree, we do need some fun reading with all that's happening now."
Awesome trip report thank you for sharing!!
Nice report and great details. You guys sure got around alot. Fun stuff!!! A nice read for a lazy COVID-19 Sunday
"Very enjoyable report. I don't see an issue with watching what you are spending. I have a tendency to do that also. One of my quirks is I will not eat at the Earl at Caesars because the sammies are about $2 more each. So I walk down to PH. Yes, I'll blow that $2 in a heartbeat in a machine, but it is just the principal of it. Besides, the exercise is good for me. At Flamingo there is also (unless they have been recently removed) a small set of restrooms across from the buffet. I duck in there when I am wandering in the Linq alley. Another time I actually went to the conference area on the 2nd floor. (My stomach was really bothering me - I figured if I couldn't make it to the restrooms, I'd rather it be in a less public area lol!!!!). Don't remember exactly where they were but I made it!"
Great TR! Thanks for sharing.
Great TR glad you had fun in Vegas.
