I am looking for the best parking/ferry info for late July and the best option for a one night stay on the island with my ten year old. The ferry/parking situation seems very confusing. I can't find good info on the ferry website.
"Only Star Line offers free overnight parking. The Murray is across the street from Star Line on the island and reasonably priced.Edited: 11:07 pm, July 06, 2020 "
There are only 2 ferries. Star Line and Sheplers. Both websites have info on parking. Regarding a hotel I recommend going to the Island website www.mackinacisland.org. The hotels are allListed there as well as B&Bs.
"If you are concernewd about Covid-19, Sheplers appears to being doing the most to disinfect the boats between trips and otherwise protect passengers."
