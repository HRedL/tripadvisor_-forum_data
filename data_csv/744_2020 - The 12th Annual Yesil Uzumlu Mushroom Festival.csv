Yummm. I love yellow morels.
"Hi F JShame you can never make it.The morel season is such that they (spawn) germinate early and pop up after the first rains welcome the Spring; and also there's a very short window in which to pick them or they rot after the rain, so hence Festival timed around the morels and not the tourists!We've enjoyed a relatively good winter I'd say and there were some super sunny hot days last week so tourists might filter in early if they get a bargain. Kind regards CCEdited: 1:17 am, February 29, 2020 "
"We managed it one April but don’t usually visit that early. Last year there was a festival mid September in Uzumlu which was good fun- craft stalls, music, parades etc. Does anyone know if that is an annual event?"
"Yes, that Festival is on every year."
Unfortunately the 12th Annual Mushroom festival is cancelled in 2020 due to the prevention of public gatherings relating to the Covid-19 Virus outbreak.Very sorry about this happening but I feel reassured Turkey are taking the correct preventative steps.Corona virus (COVID-19) nedemi ile Yesiluzumlu kuzu gobegi festivali iptal edilmistir.CC
