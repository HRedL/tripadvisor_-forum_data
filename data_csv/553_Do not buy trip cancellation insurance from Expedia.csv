"Expedia's so-called Trip Protection package is a scam. It's expensive and its coverage is limited to health emergencies. I made the mistake of buying it, and it cost me dearly.Don't buy it!"
you bought a policy without reading what was included??
What did you expect that you did not get? Please clarify
"Another case of an OP not reading what he bought and calling it a scam. Blaming someone else is the true American pastime, not baseball. Last time I bought trip insurance, it covered health, jury duty, job layoff, terrorism, environmental issues, carrier no longer providing the service, etc. Just read it again to make sure."
"Expedia's policy would never be a ""cancel for any reason you please"" policy.Those are VERY expensive!! Most policies cover cancelling for very specific reasons that are always listed before you buy."
"I don’t doubt that the insurance provided by Expedia was very limited. The real problem is not reading the policy before purchasing the insurance. Also, it’s common knowledge to never buy insurance from a third party from which you are purchasing flights/lodging. When you buy a car, you don’t buy insurance from Mazda or Ford or Audi. You buy insurance from a separate, independent insurance company. It’s the same with travel insurance. Surely a policy written by Expedia, or worse Kiwi, edreams, Gotogate, etc will be weighted heavily in favor for the company and not the customer."
So not a scam. Just not very good value. A bit like champagne.
Expensive is a matter of perspective. A health emergency in a foreign country can indeed be very expensive. You would be singing quite a bit different tune if you did in fact have a health emergency and the insurance covered the health insurance.
A health emergency in a foreign country can indeed be very expensive.----------------It would be less expensive than in the US for sure.
"They are talking about cancelling for a health emergency prior, not getting emergency medical insurance while in destination."
"Unless your elderly, spending a ton of money on travel, or don't have health insurance I would recommend avoiding trip insurance. Most travel insurance is hard to get reimbursement for and they require very specific things to warrant paying out.I have Kaiser health insurance and they cover me inside and outside the United States. My Visa travel credit card offers trip protection and baggage protection. I also travel alone, so I only have to worry about myself."
"Medical evacuation is a $50,000 - $100,000 expense. Travel insurance is not medical insurance. International coverage is not the norm for medical insurance."
">>I also travel alone, so I only have to worry about myself<<Do you not have any elderly relatives? What would you do if you were away from the USA when one of them became terminally ill?"
"""Most travel insurance is hard to get reimbursement for and they require very specific things to warrant paying out.""Every type of insurance - home, auto - has specific requirements that must be met in order for the insurer to pay out. My travel insurance has paid every single time I have claimed, because I don't claim for things that aren't covered, and I submit the necessary documentation to prove my claim. Nothing hard about it."

"#10 oh my !!! very bad advice (and dangerous ) do NOT travel without travel insurance.!!! ! there are many charges that are covered by a proper travel insurance that are not included in your own health insurance or cc insurance, too often have we seen people on these fora (usually from the states) moaning about how they were not covered by their own perceived insurance !Edited: 1 year ago "

"I have a hunch although nothing more that equivalent travel insurance bought in the UK and the USA may differ hugely in cost. In the UK fairly comprehensive insurance is not that expensive (assuming no pre exisiting medical conditions) and is seen and pushed as essential. It's not a massive extra to the cost of travel and using annual, family policies it becomes cheaper still. It the UK it would be condemned as very bad advice to travel without adequate insurance."
"So why limit the need for travel insurance to only the elderly? Accidents and unforseen circumstances can occur at any time, and affect both young and old. There is no age distinction for those who unfortunately just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time; floods, fire, infrastructure issues delaying travel can affect folks of all ages.Travel and trip interruption insurance can cover a multitude of situations including the death of a companion or parent, a fire making one's home inhabitable, jury duty, etc... Personally, I feel that it is a small price to pay for peace of mind -- which is why I carry annual travel insurance but do not feel the need to advertise the name all over the forums."
Alan H (post #10) constantly promotes one company.
"#10 what rubbish!“Unless your (sic) elderly, spending a ton of money on travel, or don't have health insurance I would recommend avoiding trip insurance.”As I posted on another thread, lorry (and other) drivers don't stop to check the age of people in their path when their brakes fail. Fires breaking out in hotels don't bypass rooms containing young people and food poisoning doesn’t only affect those “of a certain age”. As for the statement that “Most travel insurance is hard to get reimbursement for and they require very specific things to warrant paying out”I wonder how Alan H knows that? As he is so set against insurance, other than the company he seems to push on these forums, he presumably has no first hand experience. I have never had a claim denied. Why? Because I choose reputable companies, I check the fine print and only claim for what I’m entitled to.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Agree completely with posts 13 and 19. I've rarely had to claim, but that I've so far been lucky has never prevented me from making sure I never leave home to go on a trip without comprehensive travel insurance. But never Expedia's! I've needed the odd back and forth email or letter to produce a bit more factual evidence, but never had a claim denied that was not valid. You never know what's around the corner ......SWT"
"Do you not have any elderly relatives? What would you do if you were away from the USA when one of them became terminally ill?-----------------You can self insure for that. If I am overseas and have to fly back for an emergency, then I buy a ticket to do so or change my already booked return flight .I am not saying no insurance is a good idea, but too many people overpay for insurance for events that are so rare, you may as well self insure.I agree with some other UK posters who say the UK has a different (read that as more affordable) variety of insurance offerings that really don't cost that much, particularly with an annual plan.,Me-I have health insurance from 2 separate sources and both of them cover $5 million in out of pocket medical expenses anywhere in the world. Cost to me-nothing. Free benefit at work, and the other plan is for retirees of a company I used to work for. Also covers repatriation to Canada if required.Then credit card insurance on top of that that covers a variety of other small potato items---lost luggage, some trip cancellation benefits, overnight at a hotel, etc etc. Maybe worth something but not that much in the scheme of things.The rest, I can self insure. So no, I won't be buying expensive add on insurance products typically flogged in Canada that can easily at 10-15% to the price of a tripEvery one in the world is different, so people need to thoughtfully analyze their own needs, what they may already be insured for , and what their pocketbook can afford in a worst case scenario.Ok, will jump off my soapbox now."
"Self-insurance is fine, to a point.But consider the cost if something goes awry before the trip begins, specially if the holiday involves airfare, accommodation, possibly some excursions, etc., all non-refundable. Or the price to buy a ""walk-up"" ticket at a European airport to attend to an emergency at home. I would prefer to pay a minimal amount annually for the comfort of knowing that I would not be out-of-pocket due to some unforeseen event."
"#21 not everybody works for a company that will pay their travel insurance for them.not everybody is paid enough so they can self insure.you may be lucky being one of the tiny minority that can turn up their nose at the idea of taking out travel insurance, but please do not assume that others are as fortunate as you"
"Post 23- perhaps you can brush up on your reading skills, particularly the 2nd last paragraph. I was never suggesting what works for me should be the world wide standard.I will repeat it in case you missed it:Every one in the world is different, so people need to thoughtfully analyze their own needs, what they may already be insured for , and what their pocketbook can afford in a worst case scenario."
"The original poster never disclosed the reason for dissatisfaction. It might have been due to something which no insurance company would have covered. All this discussion may be interesting but totally irrelevant. Reply#21 is totally correct about people needing to know which covers they have and what they can afford to self-insure. However, for most people the analysis will give different results than for AlleyBubba . Many people cannot get credit cards and the associated travel insurance cover but they still want to and can travel after much scrimping. You must have seen the posts from people scammed by dud travel sites after having paid with a debit card. Life was much simpler 60 years ago when only rich people could even think about flying abroad. People with credit cards may have them maxed out for paying the annual family holiday. How many people have even US$1000 of freely disposable funds in the bank for a hospital bill, or for the cost difference between a business class and economy class air tickets when merely that is required for medical evacuation? ""the other plan is for retirees of a company I used to work for. Also covers repatriation to Canada if required."" It is amazing that Canadian stockholders have not dismantled a company that is wasting their money in such manner. People getting retirees' benefits when they are clearly not retired due to working for another company. - is that for real??I pay for annual travel insurance which obviously means that it is not from Expedia. Amazingly it is for me cheaper than single-trip insurance from the same company. The cost is less than one party night in bars - it looks like a good deal for me."
"Well, my experience was quite different. We booked a family cruise (2 cabins) 1 year ago with two elderly folks (90 and 95)...one caught pneumonia the very first night of the trip and was in the ship’s hospital the next morning for 1.5 days, followed by breathing treatments every morning and evening for the rest of the cruise (7 night total). I did not see the hospital bill, bit I was told it was around $5K (5 times what she paid for the cruise). She said there was no out of pocket to her other then the original policy (which I was surprised at if that's accurate). Given her $100 policy saved her $5000, I think that was a pretty good deal (way better than she did in the casino). We booked another family cruise (5 cabins) for next year with 2 other elderly folks, and we bought insurance for everyone, and it’s all link together. If anyone falls ill or has an accident before or during the cruise, we all get to cancel or leave together (since they are linked). Having had someone in our group use the insurance, I now consider it cheap peace of mind and spend the $50 for each of us even if it is just my wife and I.Edited: 1 year ago "
"They are a scam, you can’t even print the policy before buying it, and link doesn’t work on website for choosing state.They have no intention of paying out. I hope everyone reads your post and learns never to buy a poly from them and shame on Expedia for selling it."

"Yes, it's a scam. In case you canceling the reservation, all they do is providing you with Insurance company tel. number, and you on your own to deal with them. No support whatsoever! It's useless as a ------- on the elbow."
"Expedia is just selling you an insurance policy. You'd have to file any claim directly with the insurance company, and if you cancelled for a covered reason, you would eventually receive payment. Try contacting the insurance company/"
"Expedia is just a Booking Site, not a helper to guide you through dealings with an Insurance provider."
What sort of support do you need to make a claim? I've claimed on insurance twice and with my policies it was pretty straightforward.
"victor. your contract for insurance is not with expedia...it is with an insurance company. the details of how to conact the insurer in event of a claim are clearly stated in the policy.if you see something advertised in a paper or on tv, and then you purchase the item, do you think that it would be up to the media company to help you if something went wrong with the product?"
"That’s my experience too Roj.I check the policy covers what I’m claiming for. Phone the insurer, say I need to make a claim and answer their questions. If they tell me I need to send in paperwork to prove my claim, I do what they tell me to do."
"Someone said 'it doesn't cover bankruptcy' - well, really, who would expect travel insurance to do that?"
"Every travel insurance policy I’ve purchased (US), has covered financial insolvency of the carrier."
Victor - not reading policy details does not mean it is a scam... Your policy documents will confirm how to make a claim.If you bought a car from a garage and crashed it...would you expect the garage to deal with your insurance claim?Expedia may be able to provide you a cancellation invoice if that is what your insurance company needs but whether you have a claim with the insurance will depend on the reason for cancellation and whether the policy you selected covers that. (Hopefully you read the policy details before purchasing)
Then another difference between the UK and US and might explain why ours is generally more affordable than yours.Although I've taken it to mean bankruptcy of the customer not the carrier (it wasn't clear).
"It is true that he got what he bought... However, they never specify what is ""Cancellation Protection"" and from the convenient naming it sounds like you can cancel. It took me googleing it actually learn what is it and the only place i found it is in some pdf file somewhere deep in their archive URL.This is a deceiving tactic and yes it is widely in use by many companies."
"It’s very easy to find details of the policy, when it asks if you want to add the insurance there is a link below to the policy telling you what is included and not. Disinclination to travel is not included. Doesn’t seem deceptive to me."
"Never ever buy an insurance policy without reading it first. If it is so difficult to find, then that in and of itself should be a huge red flag. I can name something “get out of jail free card,” but a name means nothing. Will the card really get you out of jail and under every circumstance- fender bender to serial killer? I think common sense needs to play a role here."
"I also was denied coverage by a policy for Expedia travel. Many comments here blame the consumer for not reading the policy. That is not fair. In my case the policy was over 50 pages of fine print most of which allows the company to cherry pick reasons for denial. But the advertisements that lured me to buy the policy contradict the fine print, saying that the policy provides protection whenever ""stuff happens."" The fine print is not ""stuff happens."" The fine print is an incredibly narrow list of occurrences. When an insurer uses the fine print to contradict an advertisement and then blames the consumer, I call that a scam."
Caveat emptor.SWT
"Re #44: I suggest you complain to your Mass insurance regulators. WHo knows, they may be able to do something to restrict the type of advertising Expedia uses for Mass residents, require greater disclosures in policies, or something else.In the future I suggest you not buy anything through Expedia, or any other ticket broker, travel agent, tour operator, airline or cruise line. Do your own research on a site like insuremytrip.com, whiere you can compare different policies and prices, and read complete policy terms."
"I am currently dealing with a similar issue. Purchased the policy when we booked a trip. During our layover, airline said flight was delayed due to severe weather. Airline only offered cots in a ""nearby airline hangar"". I am traveling with 2 young kids who are scared to death of their suroundings. Trying to book a hotel next to the airline since calling a taxi isn't realistic since they are still in carseats. Been on hold with the insurance company for almost an hour now.. after being told that ""since we started our trip, nothing is covered"". UM, It's a LAYOVER! It's part of our trip to get to our final destination!!! WTF!"
"What does the policy state? Is the insurance only good for issues leading up to the first flight (like a cancellation policy)? It doesn’t matter what you think it should cover, only what it actually does cover. I assume you wouldn’t have purchased a policy without thoroughly reading it first."
"If the children are still in car seats, were they not being used during the flight so that you could use them in a taxi if necessary? Also, this sounds more like the flight was cancelled then delayed, as it's never a good idea to leave the airport for a delayed flight as it can, without much warning, be rescheduled to fly. One has to understand what trip insurance they have bought and whether expenses incurred during a delay will be covered. Some policies only cover things like cancelling your flights prior to departure. Trip interruption insurance is usually for having to end a trip prematurely to return home, so that wouldn't apply. Policies bought in conjunction with airlines, cruises, and tours are usually not the best and will not cover every scenario. One is much better off researching and buying thru an independent insurer. Far too many people just check the box to buy the insurance when purchasing am airfare, cruise, or tour and really haven't a clue what they're being covered for or in this case, not covered for.Since the delay is weather-related , the airline is off the hook. After our flight being delayed for hours last month, it was finally cancelled due weather. We were on our own for any expenses, but we are always financially prepared in the event we incur extra expenses associated with our trip. We worry about whether we can claim from travel insurance later. Unfortunately, many travel without the ability to cover unplanned expenses and then are upset that they don't have the funds or the proper travel insurance (if they have travel insurance at all) in place to deal with the situation."
"I have gone as far as buying only “Cancel For Any Reason” these days since everything is basically paid for in advance of actual travel now. Back in the Stone Age it was only a matter of cancelling reservations and in some cases loss of a deposit only, if that. That was then.... Today I need coverage for everything and make sure what’s included- trip cancellation, interruption, medical, evacuation, repatriation, meteor strike, bad hair day, whatever. I usually talk to a human before I purchase the insurance and ask lots of “what if” questions. Cancel for Any Reason costs more than other travel insurance, pays out 100% for standard cancellations claims and 75-80% for “I changed my mind”, which I need for business reasons. I made the mistake of purchasing the airline’s insurance once. When I tried to use it I learned it is uniquely crafted to exclude many common airline scenarios on purpose. My Bad. I didn’t check. I just ASSUMED it would cover most common airline situations but it’s the opposite! FWIW -Expedia are now owned by Tripadvisor. So is Viator Tours, the mega 3rd party tour re-seller. Looks like Tripadvisor are gearing up to be the worlds largest travel re-seller for profit. Cruises, Hotels, vacation rentals, airline searches....."
"""Expedia are now owned by Tripadvisor""Wrong, Expedia sold TA in 2011 I believe, and TA is an independently listed company on the stock market, as is Expedia."
Thank You Frommy for the correction. Have to keep up with Barry Diller.
"This is NOT ""insurance to cover ANYTHING while you are traveling.""This is simply INSURANCE ""IN CASE"" YOU HAVE TO CANCEL YOUR TRIP.Ideally, if the reason is covered in the policy; then if you cancel, you would be reimbursed.Most people follow through on their plans, except in case of death or serious accident or illness. So it's a good ""profit"" for Expedia and others who are offering this, since the insurors (aka insurers) rarely have to pay out any claims."
"not sure I understand your post - The insurance will cover whatever the policy says it covers, (Expedia offer different policies...'cancellation plan' and 'protection plan'). Read the policy details and if you don't want/need that level of cover you can choose to self-insure for travel where you do not purchase travel insurance and lose the money / pay the costs you incur yourself or find a policy elsewhere."
"Don’t buy it they want an original receipt, a report from the airline or hotel itself and a police report or home owners insurance showing you reported the loss or damage that you are asking for reimbursement for. You must provide 3 documents and they will review the claim!!!Never again will I purchase the Expedia total flight protection plan because it’s not worth it!! Better to find an independent insurance company or trust in God!"
That sounds pretty normal to me. If something is stolen you will be asked for the receipt and usually a police report if it was reported to them.No one will reimburse you without some proof of ownership at least and of course the police should be notified if you had things stolen.
"Agree, you always have to complete paperwork when you file an insurance claim, and provide proof of loss. That is nothing unusual."
"Not only should you never buy trip insurance from outfits like Expedia, but you should carefully read any policy you do buy and be careful about taking extremely valuable things on your travels. It isn't clear to me what was lost or stolen, but suggest you ask yourself whether it was necessary for your trip. Is there something of less value you could have taken instead? In the meantime, maybe you could collect on some other insurance you have."
"This is not a societal ill. It's a matter of fine print. However, nowhere, under the insurance option, does it tell you that it will take 6 uploaded documents (six) to complete your refund claim -- claim! Not the refund, just the chance for them to review it. And I DID read the fine print and it expressly states 100% refund without noting exceptions. Travel insurance may not be a scam, but it is a deterrent for recovering your money. Expedia bears some blame for partnering with Travel Guard, an AIG company. I would not have purchased this unless Expedia had placed the link there.Edited: 1:56 pm, February 05, 2020 "

"Frank: If you are in the US and believe you were misled by Expedia or its insurer, you can complain to your state insurance commissioner because before that policy could be offered to you it had to be approved by state insurance dept. and they may take action if they believe insurer violated its rules or misled you."
Agree. Complete scam. I did everything they asked in providing documentation for my health issue and it came down to not calling or seeing my doctor between the date I purchased the insurance and the time of my trip. Long story but I was not able to get into my doctor and it was not an emergency. But I was unable to travel. Out a lot of money.
"Sorry, Jamie, I don’t really understand what happened."
"Re #62 I have never seen a trip insurance policy (or just about any other type of insurance policy) where a claimant was not required to prove a loss by a means generally accepted by the insurance industry. On medical issues, unless you are in a coma or something, this generally means getting some type of letter or note from a doctor saying, for example, that he/she had advised claimant not to travel on such and such a date on account of (flu/broken ankle/fractured skull/whatever).I once woke up on Christmas Eve morning, scheduled to fly to Europe that night, with something awful in the respiratory infection dept doing on. Ordinarily my first thought would not have been to go running to the doc right away, but I knew I didn't feel well enough to pack and needed to change that res, so I managed to get the last appt at that practice before they closed, the doc gave me a note certifying the strep throat I had, and I got reimbursed $200 for the airline change fee. Had I not gone to doc, had I felt I was ""too sick"" or something, I would have gotten nothing from insurer. Same thing goes for cancellations due to serious illnes or death of family member. You have to have proof."
"I bought the trip cancellation insurance for a round trip Colombia-Taiwan booked with 7 months of anticipation having in mind the returning date could probably change... before I bought it I passed a copy of the insurance policy to three different travel agents who told me the company would surely cover this change...well, they didn't... arguing the policy didn't cover work reasons because I am attending a conference (on my own expense) apart on visiting some friends and the dates changed of the conference due to the COVID19 crisis. Resuming, don't spend money on this insurance because the responsibility for compliance depends almost entirely on a unilateral decision from the insurance company..."
The insurance is a scam. I cancelled a flight because I was worried about infecting an 89 year old with the corona virus due to the World Health Emergency and it was not covered.

"Lee - the OP was over a year ago, they have not posted since....you are unlikely to get a response unless you maybe send them a private message"
"I agree. It might be a good option, but only if you can get a hold of an agent.There is a travel ban because of COVID-19 and it looks like Expedia is having ""Technical Difficulties"", how convenient. I am saying goodbye to my money.Remember this when the COVID-19 scare is over. This company is going out of their way to avoid customer calls, not ethical."
"Based not on personal experience but purely on common sense, I would suggest that Expedia are not trying to avoid you specifically, nor necessarily trying to shirk any responsibility or liability, or even behave unethically. Simply, they and every single other travel business across the entire globe is completely and utterly swamped with enquiries for cancellations that they are doing their best to deal with with limited staff and an ever changing situation.I doubt the current situation is 'convenient' to anybody at all, with our without travel plans. SWT"
"I agree SussexWorldTraveller - Armin K's post is a tad on the unreasonable side to say the least and saying that he believes that Expedia (which is not one of the shonkier outfits by any means) is "".. going out of their way to avoid customer calls..,.."" just to avoid paying refunds is ridiculous to put it mildly Armin - you have clearly not thought this through logically before posting what you have . Surely having noticed that there is a worldwide crisis going onyou have realised that this means that airlines and travel agencies (all of them - the good, bad or ugly ones are all in the same boat ) are all being swamped with calls from worried clients or those wanting to cancel and get refunds. Having taken that on board , is it any wonder that your call hasn't flown straight through to someone the moment you dialed the number? Think about it for a moment - most call centres and customer service lines have queuing systems built in them and many of these are permanently programed to disconnect the call once you have been held for a set period of time which in normal instances this at least stops callers not putting the phone down properly (or their child hitting redial when they aren't looking) and running up huge bills by accident . Sadly in times where call volume is off the scale this probably means that you either cannot get through or find yourself hanging on too long and then being disconnected.Frankly to suggest that Expedia is taking advantage of the current crisis in order to deliberately prevent customers getting through to reclaim what is rightly theirs smacks of an unhealthy obsession about conspiracies against customers which I very much doubt is the case . In short - you can't get through easily because the world and his wife are also on the phone trying to get through on a line which is constantly busy and may well crash from time to time because of the volume of calls it is receiving. There is no conspiracy - you just need to be patient and keep trying until you finally get through !Edited: 12:36 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Can not reach Expedia by phone to cancel vacation package. Finally reach after 1.30 on the phone, receive answer that system does not work, put me on hold next 20 min and disconnected.

"It happened to me. Expedia sold reservation insurance if ""couldn't make it"" Airline cx flight, hotels would not refund and the AIG insurance would not pay."
"Because the hotel room I reserved in Moab Utah for Easter Jeep Safari had a non-refundable provision, Expedia proactively offered room cancellation insurance. Seems a good buy at $40. Due to cornanvirus, on 3/17/2020 the county banned out of town guest check-in at all hotels in Moab. A day later the event was cancelled. I submitted a claim for a refund on 3/17, the day of the County's order. Provided all the documentation they requested. Since then, nothing, no response. Their claims website say ""Your claim has been received pending review,"" If you call their help desk they put you on interstellar hold and eventually hang up.

@75 .... or just maybe they are a bit busy and possibly they might have a few employees off sick?Of course your conspiracy theory might be right - why not burn down a 5g mast or two to test it?Alternatively you could just wait - what else are you planning on doing right now?
"My trip was cancelled due to Covid 19. I paid over $3000.00 for my hotel and purchased trip insurance from Expedia. When I filed my claim the Expedia claim went right to AIG who Expedia evidently uses. AIG is one of the biggest villains in the insurance industry. I've been waiting since mid March, spent hours making calls, and getting shuffled around and around. Expedia travel insurance is a scam. I will never purchase travel insurance again. Period!"
Vilifying travel insurance just because you have a bad experience with one provider is not a good idea. Check the credit card you used to pay for the trip. They may have automatic travel coverage.Next time purchase your hotel directly from the hotel. Cut out the middleman that will cause you problems when changes or events occur. You do NOT need the middleman. They don't save you money.
"Thank you. I agree with you. I tried to make the reservation direct from the hotel, but was told there were no vacancies for my dates. Only then did I use Expedia to make the reservation, which I was able to do. I made an error doing what I did. I won't ever do it again. It was a costly lesson, but I haven't given up on the insurer just yet."
