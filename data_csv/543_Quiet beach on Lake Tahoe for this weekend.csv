HiWe are in kings beach for this weekend and found the beach and moon dunes very crowded. I know we chose the wrong weekend to get here.any suggestions from locals on a quieter part of the lake where we can swim or kayak.
"July 4th, quiet, Lake Tahoe.Bahahahaha."
">>I know we chose the wrong weekend to get here.<<Asked and answered.AND if a local did know some quiet spot you think they’re going to give it up?Edited: 7:29 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"Yes, on the Hyatt’s private beach in Incline Village. We went earlier today and had our pick of lounges. The attendant sprayed our lounges in front of us, and set up an umbrella for us. They check your wristband twice, one to walk in and one to get towels from the kiosk. Of course Sand Harbor is a few miles over. The parking lot fills by 10 am so they have a shuttle leaving every 20 min from the old school house in Incline, where you can park. I’d check Sand Harbor State Park website for more info."
"Thank you everyone for your responses . Yes agree wasn’t a good idea. Canative , thank you for the suggestion of Hyatt. Do they allow outsiders to pay and use or is it only for hotel guests?"
"I don’t know about the day passes from the Hyatt. Also check the visitor center for passes to the other 3 beaches in Incline. We’ve been staying here this week for 25 years, during the remodeling and rebuilding. Normally, they put on a great firework show as does Kings Beach. This year is different. Tonight went to dinner at the Old Range Steak House in Tahoe Vista, past KB. We always like to try a new place or two each year. If into steaks or pasta, we liked it and view of lake from our front row booth."
"""a shuttle leaving every 20 min from the old school house in Incline"" - no shuttle this season due to covid-19"
That will limit the number of people visiting Sand Harbor!  Thanks for the update. We went early.
"There is supposed to be a public clothing optional beach which might be quiet. Or you can go to a non private beach or the Truckee River either early or late when there's fewer people, might be colder water though."
Thank u for the suggestions. was planning to do tubing on the river but I guess that too will be crowded . Canative I saw your other post on the fire trail and did it this morning . It was just amazing . Tried getting into sand Harbor beach and parking was closed at 9am. So ended up in kings beach.I did see incline beach and another park beach nearby to that which got crowded at 9. May go early tomorrow.I will look for passes too.
"So glad you did the fire trail! A lot of bang for your buck! Not many know about it or do more strenuous hikes. Today at Incline (Hyatt) Beach, my son and his 16 yr daughter went parasailing. So handy to have a sign up desk right on the beach. You can check ahead on passes for Burnt Sugar and 3 beaches online."
Thank you CAnative . Glad they went parasailing. I will check for passes online now.Just closing this thread with some places we found . We did sugar point beach in the afternoon . Was the least number of people we saw . This is a good option for a quieter beach. Loved it. We then drove to fallen lake and the falls. The lake was very quaint and again lesser people but the drive to the falls was so narrow am not sure i would recommend this . Speedboat beach shows closed but it had a few people around and it was like a small cove.
