How's the situation in Hanoi now for those who are there? Are things still running or is it a total standstill? Tourist attractions open?
27 Dutch put in quarantaine who are on round-trip who knows how many more.
Where are the Dutch people staying
"Don't know, they were on a domestic flight where one of the cases was also traveling, they all are going to be tested and if i understood it good they will have the test results in a few days."
"the government is doing a pretty good job in containing the virus. but a dozen of new positive cases were found.businesses are operating very limited, some businesses have closed down"
"It seems the government shut down attractions for disinfecting and reopen them again, but I'm not sure if this will still be the case or whether they will be shut down for quarantine.The streets of Old Quarter are quiet tonight. It was more lively last night."
"It makes no sense to close and open again, it looks like this virus is not gone on a short time, still don't understand the mass hysterical behavior, the seasons flu killed more people worldwide.Hope that they are getting back the common sense back worldwide when they see that this is going to be a huge recession."
"JojoB, When there's still a chance in some country to contain the virus, the authority may deem it's worthwhile to take drastic measures for the long-term benefit.An example is Taiwan:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/pla…Regards,JohnEdited: 12:32 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"> still don't understand the mass hysterical behavior, the seasons flu killed more people worldwide.Flu kills about 0.1% of those that get it. Covid-19 maybe 2% or more. Many people are vaccinated against flu. Covid-19 spreads much faster than flu. UK is doubling every 3 days at the moment. If that keeps up, we'll be into the millions by April and possibly tens or hundreds of thousands dead."
"And if left unchecked, we could see a situation like in Italy.https:/…John"
"JojoBreda, locals still want foreigners to come as it boosts their economy.Disinfecting attractions is probably a preventative measure so they can avoid shutting it down completely? That's just my guess.I think there will be more people in Trang An today as Halong Bay and Tam Coc is closed. Travel agents have been booking their customers for Trang An instead."
"""locals still want foreigners to come as it boosts their economy"" Not at this time. It is true that foreigners have contributed much to the revenue of tourism in Vietnam, but at this time we place the health benefits of the people above the economic benefits.Vietnam has stopped visa exemption for 8 European countries since March 12. And the fact that some foreigners are not conscious of preventing the spread of disease, by simply wearing a mask, makes us very concerned."
"Yes, the Viet Government wants tourists so much that, as early as ONE February, it stopped all flights between China and Vietnam when, in 2019; there was 1.5 million Chinese tourists visiting the country., which means that it di not hesitate to forget huge tourists revenues ! I can assure you that, if there is one country which does take the corona seriously, is the Viet one ! The government takes very rapidly all the necessary measures and the people do the same ; for ex., hotels and restaurants bring antiseptic soap to clients when they enter. Nobody including me worries.Edited: 12:15 am, March 12, 2020 "
