"Hello! I would like to plan our first family trip (family of 8) to Costa Rica for next year spring break. We know nothing about it or the area. We frequently travel to Maui, but would like to try something different. Is it safe? Are there grocery stores near by to rent a car and go grocery shopping? We usually rent a home or condo through Vrbo. Any recommendations? Are certain areas better tag others? We would like to stay around 6k for the week."
Tamarindo beach area...and or Manuel Antonio National ParkTamarindo the best fly to LIRManuel Antonio SJOroadadvsiro
"Yes, it's safe. If it was not, there would not be over 1.7 million travelers to Costa Rica every year. Yes, there will be supermarkets to buy groceries, and yes there are rental cars. There are 7000 rentals in Costa Rica. Hard to say what would be best for your family, as some don't care how many bedrooms there are as much as how many beds there are. You have time to explore the areas that you would like. Tamarindo, Nosara/Samara, Flamingo, Coco, Manuel Antonio, Uvita, Santa Teresa/Mal Pais, just to name a few. Get a guide book or research online then come back with more specific questions and we'll be happy to help. It will also help you decide if you know if you'll be using SJO or LIR airports for arrival and departure."
Safe? we are like most countries in the world today...just common senseMaybe check Tamarindo beach area...nice beaches...nice food...good stores...for Tamarindo maybe nice to fly to LIR...Many great rent a cars around.Also you may check Manuel Antonio National Park area...incredible number of houses to rent....roadadvsiro
"We have had good success with VRBO in Playa Hermosa.. Close to LIR. In my opinion you need a car to get around. .Beach area, Near Rincon de La Vieja national park, Cortez waterfall, Tempisque River boat trips.Multiple supermarkets in Playa del CocosDay trip driveable to Rio Celeste3 hours drive to La Fortuna Arenal area … but stay a night at least there. too far for a ""day trip""***VRBOs we have success with in Playa Hermosa.Hermosa HeightsVillas SolOcean Breeze"
"I would avoid VBRO. In the middle of a global pandemic and with the Costa Rican border closed, they are doing nothing to help. We won't be refunded the money we spent for the vacation rental we can't use even if we wanted to. Airbnb did the right thing. I will never use VBRO again."
"When you book via VRBO, etc, your booking is governed by each homeowner's reservation policy, is it not? According to VRBO, they are. See https:/…vrbo-covid-19-message . Try to contact the owners directly, if possible, and use own travel insurance, is the VRBO's advice."
Thank you Nat...that makes a lot of sense...great advice...thank you !!roadadvisor
Thank you!
"They're talking Spring in 2021. This Covid-19 thing better be settled by then or nobody is going anywhere by next year, this time.... VRBO or HotelEdited: 8:34 pm, March 29, 2020 "
"Use AirBNB if you go anywhere. VRBO doesn’t control the money on rentals so if you need to cancel because of COVID, VRBO won’t stand behind you. And their insurance they offer, CSA is also worthless. They consider it a pandemic and carve it out of the coverage. Get a better (and more expensive carrier like Allianz if you want insurance."
"You could also check Tulemar Bungalows in Manuel Antonio. They have a variety of different accommodations. Nice beach and lots of wildlife on site like sloths and monkeys. Many good open air restaurants nearby. We did get groceries while we were there, but if you want, they have a concierge service who will stock your frig for you."
"Like ES from Boston said, Airbnb is a good way to go. We've done that the past three years in Costa Rica and had incredible success getting what we wanted at a reasonable value. We like the homeyness of Playas Del Cocos best.As far as rental cars go, you definitely want to do your research. Some rental companies do a great job with decent pricing while others are just to be avoided. You should start by reading the ""Everything you need to know about rental cars in Costa Rica"" along the right column of this page.It's cool for me to see that you are from Flint. My parents grew up and met there in the early 1950s.Good luck and we hope you find Costa Rica as wonderful as we have."
"@10 ES, have you been able to get a refund from the VRBO you recently posted about - ""...wired over $6k to a property company in Italy. When COVID struck the owner wouldn’t refund the $...""?"
You are more than WELCOME...sorryabout some questions...roadadvsiro
Make sure you read the reviews of VRBO before you do this.
"@15, Welcome to the CR forum, Tom! What was your experience with VRBOs in Costa Rica?"
"My experience has been in the USA. I suggest to check their reviews because they are a solid 1 or less star in most reviews. If something goes wrong expect to lose you $$ or have to fight for months for fair treatment. This is my review for them which I hope will help others to avoid horrid VRBO Service practices:Will not Ever, Ever again rent through VRBO. I believe, that for the good of all, VRBO should cease to exist. Shame on VRBO and Expedia for treating customers so badly.I wish I could give negative stars for VRBO and the parent Company Expedia of Seattle Washington. We booked a ski vacation in Colorado for this past March only to have Gunnison County shut down to outsiders due to Covid. We were not permitted to go and they could not deliver the property. After hours and hours on the phone and enduring efforts by VRBO and their agent to discourage us, we finally got them to agree that a refund was due. Simple you might think. It takes them nano-seconds to put a charge on your card, but it took more than three months and a multitude of excuses and foot dragging by VRBO Customer Service to finally get our money back.The VRBO Customer Service approach is to drag you on endlessly with absolutely lame excuses for why the commitments they make to the customer are never delivered on as promised. I believe their strategy is to wear the customer down in hopes that they will give up and go away. In our case we made it abundantly clear that we were NOT going to go away. We finally had success when we made it clear to them that we were in touch with travel editors at nationally distributed newspapers and with Attorneys Generals in several states to tell our story of the horrible business practices at VRBO.I see many below who failed to get their refunds. Please do not give up. Start writing to those travel editors at publications like USA Today, LA Times, NY Times etc. and write or call the Attorney Generals in the states where you live, where you tried to rent, in Texas where VRBO HQ is located and in the state of Washington where Expedia HQ is. Also write to Barry Diller the CEO of Expedia. Do not give up, stay after them until they do the right thing.VRBO and Expedia: ""Nothing Will Become You Like Your Going"""
