"Hi there, we are a big travelling family (consisting of old grandma, parents, aunts & uncles, lots of teenagers and one 10 yr child). Am thinking of doing a 8 day Canadian roadtrip in 2nd week of Jun this year. Would probably need to rent 2 MPVs. Am thinking of driving from Toronto to Ottawa. Presently thinking of this route : Toronto - Gananoque - Ottawa - Kingston - Toronto. Apart from this, allocated 1 day to do day excursion to Niagara Falls. If time permits, can also allocate more time to overnight at Niagara Falls so as to do Niagara-on-the-Lake too.For the Toronto-Ottawa roundtrip route, are there any alternatives we could possibly consider? Now, we are actually travelling on the same road but breaking up the 5 hrs journey (Toronto-Ottawa) with first Gananoque (on way up) and then Kingston (on way back). For each place, we will overnight (in some places, more than 1 night) so that we can see the attractions/scenery of each place.Your feedback is much appreciated."
Please confirm.. is your stay in Toronto included in this 8 days? Or separate.
My stay in Toronto is separate - another 2 days in addition to the 8 days.
"I don't think you need to stop in Kingston and Gananoque, at least for overnights. You could stop in Kingston, spend the evening, and then do Gananoque and the 1000 Islands boat tour the next day before heading to Ottawa. On your way back you can either (a) veer off Hwy 401 onto the Loyalist Parkway and spend some time in Prince Edward County or (b) leave Ottawa via Hwy 7, overnight in Peterborough, and use whatever spare time you may have exploring the surrounding Kawarthas region. I think you could do the trip in 6 or 7 days, which would allow you to allocate one more day to Toronto."
Will read up on Prince Edward Country and Peterborough. Thanks
"Prince Edward County is worth the visit. Vineyards, beaches etc.Peterborough is a mid-size typical Canadian town of no interest, BUT, hiway 7 is very scenic."
"I wouldn't say Peterborough is of no interest. It's a small city, with a beautifully situated university, a large & active farmers market, the very huge Trent Canal Liftlocks which can be seen by way of boat tours, and the intriguing Canadian Canoe Museum, which explores parts of Canada's history through the use of that vessel.https://thekawarthas.ca/If you take Hwy #7 from Ottawa, you can stop in Perth, a lovely heritage town."
"I suggested Peterborough because (a) I would say it is actually quite nice and interesting, (b) it is a great launching off point for touring the surrounding Kawarthas region (and you could stay somewhere in the Kawarthas rather than Peterborough if wanting something more ""wilderness-y"") and (c) you're passing right through if taking Hwy 7."
"Thanks for the feedback. I will look at both Prince Edward County and Peterborough (Kawarthas). By the comment that Highway 7 is scenic, it is really an attraction itself. But comparatively, between Peterborough and Perth, which one would be a better stop for an overnight? Moreover, for Prince Edward County, which town should I potentially look to stop in for overnight?"
"Perth is only an hour west of Ottawa. Peterborough is 3.5 hours west of Ottawa - about 90 minutes north east of Toronto.https://goo.gl/maps/KXMZdSffMBXPL16z6As for PEC, you'll have to look at the accommodation listings on the main PEC tourism website. There are no big chain hotels or resorts in the county, so that may affect where you can stay, if in fact you can find a place to hold your group. It's also important to note that in summer many accommodation providers in the County have minimum 2 night stay requirements.These sites may also be of interest in your research:https://www.ontariotravel.net/en/explorehttps://southeasternontario.ca/https://www.visitpec.ca/"
"Picton is the larger town in this area, with most of the larger hotels/B&Bs. It is also a good base from which to explore the local wineries/cideries/breweries"
Thanks kimc.
From our knowledge of travel conditions with large groups of people you might be doing yourself a favor to consider travel by train for part of this voyage. Staying in the same car with all the passengers and their needs is no laughing matter for comfort and convenience or safety. Train travel between major destinations allows for greater mobility and more comfort and less stress.
"Thanks all for the feedback. We chose to travel by car as this is where the flexibility is, as we can choose to orientate our programmes accordingly if time doesn't permit and not be held hostage by train schedules. But on another question, are MPVs (multi-purpose vans) easily available for hire in Toronto?"
Yes.. but here they are called minivans. Here are some examples:https:/â€¦vans.html
Thank you very much. This is what we are looking for.
"First, make sure your tickets and reservations are refundable. Everything is shut down because of Corona, with no certainty as to when things will open. At the moment, you would not even be allowed in the country. Second, for Ottawa you need at least three days. If you just want to do a quick trip to Niagara Falls, yes it can be a one day trip but be prepared to drive an hour and a half in each direction through very heavy traffic. Niagara on the Lake is a very pretty town to visit as well if you have a second day. From Niagara on the Lake, take a drive through the country along Lakeshore Road or Niagara Stone Road and look for a winery to tour (there are plenty.). Depending on how late in June, you might even be able to buy and eat freshly picked cherries.If you do overnight in Niagara Falls, splurge on at least one room with a view of the falls. Toronto has lots to see and do, but with teenagers with you think about heading up to Wonderland just north of the city. For the 10 year old, there is a huge zoo.  And again if it is later in June, if you go to Ottawa there is a huge water park (Calypso) just outside the city to keep your teens busy for a day. If you must stop, then Kingston would be a good place, with the Sandbanks area on the way back (for a good hike). However, my inclination would be to do the entire distance in a day given that you have limited time - it is multi-lane express highway the entire distance."
"Re-draw many parts of your proposed itinerary as preliminary as it seems to be now. You are likely to be asking for more time on the clock or calendar when none will be available. Sacrificing or giving up time for Ottawa just for a visit to the souvenir shops at Niagara Falls is not good use of Canadian travel time. Save Niagara Falls for another voyage when you are going in that direction rather than to Ottawa. Your proposals are too far-reaching and needless to say you are trying to cover too much territory in too short a time period with a large group of fellow travelers. We have traveled the route during the daytime more or less from Toronto to Ottawa along 401 as far as Prescott before turning left to drive to Ottawa. For us there is nothing harmful for designating Ottawa as the only destination for what it is worth as a place to visit. Choose to drive straight to Ottawa without stopping for much at the intermediate places that do get much hullabaloo in publicity in the Thousand Islands arena. Save the Thousand Islands for a separate expedition. Gananaque and near by places do deserve your attention as they are in a different category than Peterborough. Arrange to see them at another time. But the many places surrounding Kingston and the like are not compelling excuses for arrival later than necessary at Ottawa. Comparing attractions at Peterborough with what awaits you in Ottawas is not a fair comparison. Ottawa has much to offer and will not disappoint you. We did stop for rest at the McDonald's at Prescott. Not that it is worth more than the Parliament buildings in Ottawa, but it did indeed provide us with a vantage point for aligning our view of the river crossing options and navigate our planning around a new series of roads. Reading road maps and travel literature at the McDonald's at Prescott made it a necessary place to rest and eat lunch. Our goal was arrival at Ottawa for it was and is worth our time to return there as being a more serious location because of its function location and purpose. Places mentioned as being worthy of our time do deserve your attention if your goal is not immediate arrival at Ottawa within five hours or so of driving time from Toronto. Stopping at Peterborough on the return to Toronto is worth doing. For now get to Ottawa as quickly as possible. Peterborough is not Ottawa no matter how many times you slice the cheese. Giving up vacation time for a detour to the Thousand Islands lasting more time than you spend in Ottawa is not a good use of Canadian travel time. Much more substance awaits you in Ottawa. Go there directly."
A June trip this year is not recommended. Canada is no where near to flattening the covid curve. Too much uncertainty in the travel industry right now.
"Thank you all. Yes, trip is definitely cancelled due to Covid-19 being even worse than what it was in Feb."
