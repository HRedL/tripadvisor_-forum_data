Was there a massive influx of tourists yesterday? Thanks.
"I can't say a massive influx because 278 has been quiet IMO. I will say that I have seen an increase in out of state plates percentages in places like Wal-Mart and our grocery stores both in Bluffton and on the Island, which means tourists/evacuees are here to ride it out."
"I checked out one of the “ private access” beaches today out of curiosity (from a wide distance; didn’t actually even go onto the beach). Pretty busy. Not as crowded as a typical late March, but busier than it ought to be if folks cared more about this COVID-19 crisis. Hey, I like tourists. I volunteer in many capacities on the island that support and educate tourists about nature, activities, etc. But this truly is not the time to vacation. I really encourage us to take a deep breath and pause. Hopefully this crisis will be contained by summer and we can all get back to vacation plans. I canceled 3 trips for the spring. Fingers crossed my late July trip can go as planned. Stay safe.J"
"Just want to say we own here, but rent in NJ near our kids and grandkids. We flew down this time and have a rental car with Florida plates. We’ve been here 3 1/2 weeks and are cancelling our flight back. So some of the out of state cars are part timers who fly back and forth. Just saying. Thanks! Stay safe All!"
"Not really sure it makes a difference whether you are a local, a transplant or tourist, if you practice social distancing. If you don't then it could be your demise. ie. tourists do not go into nursing homes-yet that is where there are cases. But only time will tell. Be safe everyone and take this seriously."
Well now there is no question: Governor has closed all beaches and boat launches. Time for everyone to isolate.
"We take this very seriously. It’s wonderful reading on our deck or walking on the beach super early. I’ve seen people self distancing EXCEPT in grocery stores. I try to go when they open, but people line up."
"Everyone is still offering rentals so how do you expect that some people won't take advantage? If the town does not want tourists, not sure why mayor and council don't just shut things down for 30-90 days? Fort Myers Beach just did it for 90 days."

Well finally the governor has ordered no more short term rentals effective Monday.
"Actually it was effective at 5 pm yesterday. Additional business must close as of Monday.Edited: 9:06 am, April 04, 2020 "
"From the Island Packet: “McMaster said the order ending rentals went into effect immediately Friday afternoon.”On Wednesday, McMaster ordered many non-essential businesses to close in effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus. South Carolina had 1,700 coronavirus cases around the state on Friday, according to the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control. At least 34 people have died from the virus.But McMaster continued to resist the idea that South Carolina issue an order requiring residents to stay at home. Most other states in the Southeast have issued such stay-at-home orders in recent days, with Alabama becoming the most recent one on Friday.McMaster said South Carolina is different from other states that have issued stay-at-home orders, noting the Palmetto State does not have major metropolitan areas like New Orleans, Atlanta or New York City. South Carolina is one of 10 states in the country without such an order.“Every state is different,” he said. “They have different economies, different resources, they have different medical facilities. We are taking a deliberate approach, to be as aggressive as we possibly can at the right time and we’re following the data and the science to do that.”Peppered with questions on the issue at Friday’s press conference, McMaster said he is following the advice of experts in crafting the state’s response.“That could be where we end up,” McMaster said of a possible stay-at-home order. “We are taking a deliberate approach to keep our people safe.”Instead, McMaster emphasized the many other actions he has taken in response to COVID-19. The governor has previously ordered restaurants and bars to close dining areas and only operate for take-out orders. He also closed access to state beaches and waterways, and banned gatherings of more than three people.McMaster said at Friday’s press conference that he encourages people to stay home and distance themselves from others if they can.Columbia issued its own stay-at-home order last week for residents within the city limits. Charleston and Mount Pleasant have also issued stay-home orders in their municipalities, even though the state attorney general says those powers my be trumped by the governor’s emergency powers.Richland County is also considering a stay-at-home order. Other municipalities and elected leaders have called for McMaster to follow the lead of other governors and issue a statewide stay-at-home order.Reporter Joseph Bustos contributedRELATED MEDIA"
"It looks like short term rentals are only prohibited to folks from Covid-19 ""hotspots"" of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut?"
"Yeah I guess I got date wrong but it is only ban from ""hot spots"" From anywhere else its business as usual. Guess locals should be nice to the out of state plates"
