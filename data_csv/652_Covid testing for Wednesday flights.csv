I live in a city where I would have to submit a postal test kit. One site I have checked says they cannot do tests for Wednesday flights as the sample would need to be taken on a Sunday when there is no postal service. Another site says take the sample on a Saturday and post to arrive at lab on the Monday. Would Cypriot government accept results of that? Has anyone else travelled on a Wednesday who can answer this question?
"I travelled on a Wednesday and the only way I could make it work in time was to have an NHS Test on the Sunday. Results back Monday morning but I went to a drive through. You will need confirmation of the time the test was taken and I’m not sure you can do that with a postal one, plus there is a longer time period. Also the few unclear ones come back from people doing their own test. If I was you I’d get somewhere and get them to do the test if possible. If it’s impossible then you’ll have to take a gamble or cancel I think."
A postal test is not acceptable - you need the email confirmation of a drive through test appointment because that clearly shows the date and time the test was done.Which city do you live in ?
When you do the drive through test is all the info cyprus need usually on the test results
Hull. We do have drive through NHS sites but they do not issue certificates
lynda tOn 31/Jul exceptionally for UK tourists the following arrangement was confirmed to the British High Commission in Nicosia@UKinCyprus the NHS test for covid-19 will be accepted in order to travel from UK to Cyprus. passengers with NHS test need to have 1. their NHS test appointment confirmation (72 hours begin with this) 2. the NHS COVID-19 Notification (negative result).https:/…1289172033780187136
"Post 4.. Get to a drive through. You don’t need an actual certificate. That’s a wording they use which means certification, hence an e mail will do.See my idiots guide post for full details..Edited: 7:12 pm, August 21, 2020 "
Don’t get hung up on the word “certificate” it is a literal translation from the Greek.What they want is evidence of the time and date the test took place and the email confirmation of the NHS drive through test gives you that. Then you also attach your results email/text
Thank you everyone for your very helpful advice. I will do the drive through on the .Monday
Can you find a drive through appointment on the Sunday instead so would allow more time for the results to come back?
Yes I could thank you for that suggestion
We fly next Wednesday 2nd at 4.50pm.What is the latest time we can have a test? Is it possible to have a test after 5pm on Sunday or should we just settle for having the test early Monday morning?
Start looking at the website now and do a dummy booking so you can get a feel for what appointment times are on offer near you. I think some run to 8pm.
"Have just checked and the 2 closest to us only offer tests up until 1pm. We will book it on the weekend for 9am test Monday morning, that still gives us plenty of time to get results back."
Hi. At a drive through facility were you able to obtain a 'time/date test taken' proof as well as your result. I fly on Friday and intend to go drive through tomorrow
Saturday is to early anyway. Would need to have been done Sunday to qualify for 72 hrs. What flight leaves at 4am?
Hi did anyone on your flight get tested once the arrived in cyprus?
"Paulr, did your results come through in time?"
"His mummyWe flew on 25 August with Easyjet. When we landed they said anybody who hasnt had a Covid test must stay on the plane. All others are free to disembark. We left the plane as normal, went through entry procedures and they checked Cyprus Flight passes twice. We took hard copies with us. Then it was cases and out. Within 30 minutes of landing we had our cases and were in the car driving to the apartment. We landed early as well since we had 150 mph tail wind behind us."

"Just tick the “other” box, the test centre are very unlikely to question you, if they do just say I’ve been in contact with someone who has tested positive."
Tick the “other” or “prefer not to say” boxes all the way through the test application. Nobody speaks to you at the test centre other than to give you instructions On where to go and what to do. No need for lies.
Has anyone had test results come back at different times even though they were carried out at the same time?
Yes that is common.
