"To anyone traveling to Port Antonio right now: how are you getting there? Is the MoBay airport the only airport open to tourists? Because, from my understanding, Port Antonio is a 5 1/2 hour drive from MoBay. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated?"
"It isn't ""post covid"", Covid-19 is still very much active."
"As stated, Covid is very much alive and well on the island. You can fly into Kingston or Mobay check with your airline. Youâ€™ll also want to check that your accommodations are opened and approved to be open."
These days travel from Mobay to Portland and Kingston to Portland take relatively the same time.3-3.5 is more accurate When is your trip?PEACE!
