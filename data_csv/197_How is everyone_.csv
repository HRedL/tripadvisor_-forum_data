"Hi! Regular contributors here may not know each other in real life but I feel like I know so many of you. Just checking in to see how you’re doing. I’m in NY, just outside New York City on Long Island. We are in a terrible COVID-19 hotspot right now and they have asked us not to go out except for real emergencies or needs. I haven’t been to the grocery store in 2 weeks and hoping we can make it another 2 weeks. I have to go to the pharmacy but it’s a drive through so hopefully ok. Other than walking the dogs, our two greyhounds (one is a Spanish Galgo), I’m always home. My husband lost his job weeks ago so things are going to be difficult but we will be ok. I haven’t seen my elderly mom in weeks, the worst part of all of this for me. Please stay home if you can. You don’t want to be in the situation my area is in right now. It’s so scary here, our hospitals are completely full plus some. My complete admiration and love for everyone on the front lines. Our heroes under just awful circumstances. https:/…I’m terribly worried about our beloved S Africa. Please stay home, please stay safe. We will get back to travel when we can. I’m looking forward to helping visitors with their trips and I can’t wait to come back “home” soon. I know this isn’t travel related but I just want to know how everyone is doing. How are you?"
"It is very much travel related, cbir. Not only for international travellers but also for domestic ones. People still thinks that since outside is sunny and virus is invisible, it does not exists. Only words from the first hand could persuade them. Our government started stricter measures early. But it is not all about what the government has to say. It is more about what we are doing, each person has an important role in this situation. BTW it is day 49 of my firstly self-imposed now government imposed home isolation. Numbers are telling that infection is slowing down min my country. We should not celebrate yet.Edited: 9:41 am, April 09, 2020 "
"Sorry to hear about your husband's job cbir. And not seeing family is hard. Things don't look good in NY state. We're about 35 miles north west of London and all healthy. DH and I are in our 4th week of working from home (I think, I lose count!) - our teenage kids had a couple of weeks of streamed lessons from school before the Easter school holidays started. I only go out to the supermarket every few days and DH and our son go out cycling occasionally in the Chilterns. We have a garden and we've had good weather the last few days so we're able to get out at home.I do worry about our upcoming trips and wonder what to do about them. We are supposed to be visiting Namibia in July and Ecuador in October. I'm pretty sure the July won't happen but it's too soon to say for Ecuador yet although it has the worst coronavirus stats in South America. The booking arrangements were quite complex on both - not least as Ecuador was a rebooking for a trip that previously went wrong - and we could lose a fair bit of money."
In South Africa the lockdown has just been extended from 16 to 30 April which is no surprise.
"#4.I am not convinced.Liquor stores are being looted, people are buying ""bootleg""liquor.People are buying illegal cigarettes on the black market. Jobs have already been lost, due to companies battling in an already fragile economy, closing down, my step daughter is one.There are already daily pleas for help,from freelancers in various sectors of the economy, who have no safety net, being out of money, no food for their children, no money for rent. South Africa has about 12000 fatalities per year, being related to the "" ordinary"" seasonal flu, and about 50 deaths per day as a result of violence and murder.Just saying."
"#5. Those numbers will stay the same. But COVID-19 deaths will add on top. And why adding 18.000 deaths in 2 weeks (USA) if it could be avoided, at least some of them? Not to mention the collateral impact of health system being flooded and overloaded with COVID-19 patients.Just saying."
Locked down in a nice flat in Manchester. Better than it sounds. . Plenty food and wine. Can get out once a day. Our government got into action a month too late. Over 70 so this could be a long haul.
I’m glad we are hearing from many of you! Great you seem to be holding up ok. Please stay safe. I don’t know how or when this will end but I can’t wait to virtually see you all when we get back to helping others visit. Please keep responding! Be nice so they don’t shut it down. Looking forward to hearing from more of you #PostponeDontCancel
"Hi all. We are from the south west of England, Devon to be precise. I recognize some of your names as you replied to my posts earlier in the year regarding our planned 4 week road trip due this November. Flights, 4 weeks worth of accommodation and a week in Kruger rest camps booked and paid for so all on hold at the moment, we wont be cancelling anything for now.A little about us, we are a couple (mid 50's and 60's), live and work as wardens on a large caravan touring park. We shut down some weeks ago and it is so strange not having any campers and tourers here when normally, it's so busy. We are very lucky in that we have acres to wander around in, and beautiful woodland all to ourselves. Will never take it for granted again. We go out once a week for supplies to the local supermarket. All in all, we are managing well and appreciate how lucky we are.Last year, we had our first ever trip to South Africa in November. 4 weeks, covering Cape Town, Hermanus, Garden Route, Addo, Karoo, Oudtshoorn and the winelands. We loved every moment and fell in love with the people and beauty of this wonderful country. Hence, after Christmas we started planning for this year. Who knows if this trip will go ahead, I so hope it will. Stay safe everyone !"
"Thanks for starting this thread. I watch with horror what is going on in New York, so pleased to hear you’re safeAll is very strange here. I work in agriculture and from home, so that doesn’t feel too different. Trying g to stay at home as much as possible, only shopping once a week and helping others who are vulnerable I think about SA a lot and worry what will happen if it gets out of control.My friends there keep me in the loop and we chatted on WhatsApp quite a lotHoping to get back at the end of the year, but who knows if that will be possibleStay safe everyone"
"My guess is that this may take a long time to pay out and travel may not be the same at the end. Travel ins for us 70+ may be difficult however our health is. That said I just cannot believe that we have made our last trip to Africa. It started wth a standard tourist visit round SA which included 2 days in Addo and 2 days in Pilanesberg. I then worked as a volunteer teacher in Tanzania followed by a grand visit to the northern safari circuit. We were hooked.I look back to those amazing moments. Gharaghab bloody hell what an experience., tracking rhino on foot in Damaraland, early mornings in Kruger, leopards in Luangwa. We are so lucky.2021? Why notEdited: 6:04 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"Thanks Lisa. It’s scary here in New York but hanging in there so far. Going to the grocery store is the scariest thing ever - how is that?! I’m grateful our state governor is calm, honest and informative when it comes to our current circumstances. The next week or two hopefully my area will see a bit of slowing of the hospitalizations. My mom was 74 on her first visit to S Africa! Such wonderful memories, John. Fortunate doesn’t begin to describe my gratitude. Our experiences with rhino conservation are our best days. A few weeks before the lockdown, I did a fundraiser for 1000 notebooks, pens and crayons for schools in KZN, delivered in late February. I’m hoping to be able to continue similar soon. But who knows... life could be very different. I don’t know how this will end but I’m confident there will be a vaccine and effective treatments in the not too distant future and we will all get to visit our favorite places in S Africa and Southern Africa again. I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that the whole world, with few exceptions, is standing still. I am looking forward to seeing the other side of this."
"Hi all, it is sad to see how quiet this normally , chatty forum has been in the last month or so. My husband and I live approx. 40 miles East of Buckingham Palace and are coping well . We are fortunate not to have to worry about loosing jobs, homes etc. (both retired) , we have a nice garden and one street away from our home , there is a grass promenade with flower beds overlooking the Thames Estuary, which we can enjoy on our short daily exercise. So nothing to complain about . However , my daughter works in a Hospice and her husband is a GP so there is always some anxiety regarding their welfare. There have already been approx. 120 deaths in our local 2 hospitals just a few miles from our home . cbir - we are seeing harrowing news items on our TVs from NY State , our thoughts are with you. I guess your plans to move to SA are very much on hold for the time being. We have 2 European holidays which were booked last year but we are resigned to them not happening, one in Ibiza for May and the other to Northern Cyprus for the end of September . It would be crass to spend time worrying about missed holidays ( a luxury) considering what is happening throughout the world . As far back as February we took the decision not to come on our annual family holiday to SA in November, 2020, although the British Airways Sale fares to Durban were very tempting. Our decision was based on my nephew s experience on trying to come to the UK for a holiday in mid February (he lives in Manilla ) His flight ,via Hong Kong ,was cancelled and it was impossible to find another seat on any other airline , as other flight hubs ( e.g. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur ) began to ban flights . Then there was the cruise ship that was floating for sometime offshore Japan having been banned from docking at many ports in the Far East. At the same time Italy started to confirm coronavirus victims, it was all a bit too close for home for my liking . We are now planning a one month tour of Kwa Zulu for January 2020 but I am not optimistic . It seems that SA has taken containment action early but I fear that once it enters the shanty/slum areas it will be almost impossible to contain and be disastrous . It will be impossible for those citizens to follow the guidelines of regularly washing of hands, and keeping a 2 metre distance between persons when many people do not even have running water and extended families live together in a few rooms. Already there are a huge number of people who are already vulnerable with TB and being HIV positive, it does bode well."
"Thanks gem. I appreciate the thoughts for us. I hope you all get through this with less chaos and horror than we have experienced. I think everyone’s plans in the near future are on hold, I just hope not for too long. I share your deep concern for S Africa. I had friends in S Africa late February. It’s stunning how the world has completely changed since. They had no trouble getting home but just a week or two later would have been so difficult. Some day we will all get back to traveling as before. I miss this forum too. Agree or disagree, it was always animated!! #StayHome #PostponeDontCancel"
"Thank you for starting the thread. We are a retired couple living in Green Valley Arizona which is about 25 miles south of Tucson. It is a retirement community and we are sheltering in place. WE do online ordering for groceries so we do not have to go into the stores. I have a rare muscle disease so I will continue to get weaker a the years pass. We took our first trip of a life time safari in 2017 to SA, Zimbabwe and Botswana. We have been back to SA each year since. This year we were scheduled for 3 weeks beginning May 16. Because of my disease, we always take along someone to help. I love sharing the African experience with people. This year we were taking our daughter and son in law for their honeymoon. We are trying to reschedule the private lodges for May 2021. I have rescheduled my Kruger units to November. Maybe we will be lucky and get to go. If not, we will move them to May 2021. We always do a combination of Kruger self drive and private lodges. We have developed friendships with several people in SA and keep in touch. I read the SA news everyday and am frankly worried for the people of SA. I pray they will not suffer too much and will recover quickly."
"Hi all,In Australia its not as bad as around the world with 6300 odd cases with only 61 deaths - but economically its been pretty harsh - our borders are closed internationally but also between states domestically.We have wide shut downs with only ""essential services"" still open - and I fall into that category being a 'fridgy' (refrigeration) connected to major supermarket outlets.... our unemployment has doubled overnight but the government has been fast to act - paying employers 1500 per fornight as long as they put people on leave (not firing them) so people stay employed (whilst on indefinate leave) to return when the shut downs are over...My wife has been stood down from work as she works in indoor sports / fitness but that payment from the government means we aren't out too badly.The issue for our country has been that 80% of our cases have come from overseas and only 20% are community transmission - the biggest stuff up was a cruise ship called the ruby princess that docked in March into Sydney harbour.... the ship was allowed to dock as usual and the captain reported no one on board sick - 2-3 weeks later there were around 600 confirmed cases from the 2700 on board and a large % of our death toll is related back to that cruise,Our Prime Minister has said these lockdowns (domestic) will be expected for around 4-6 months ... before slowly easing... i dont expect to be able to travel internationally until next year - some countries are being hit harder than others and the end to this is not in sight.."
"edwardo - thanks for postponing and not canceling. It’s great you’re able to travel and enjoy Southern Africa so much. Obviously “one of us”. Those trips of a lifetime become the first of me to!. I truly hope November happens for you. If not, this is much worse than many of us believe. I think many of us feel as you do. So much concern. steve - all cases came from elsewhere. NY’s cases are mostly from Italy, according to the research. They didn’t start in Italy. We travel, we love the places we visit, we go home. It still stuns me that pretty much everyone is home all over the world. I’m in the middle of the worst of it right now, though it seems to be leveling off. I fear many will relax and go out more and we go right back to where we are now. Our “leadership” isn’t talking 4-6 months, trying for 4-6 weeks or less here (I agree with your PM for sure). It’s going to be very difficult for all of us. I hope someone is smart enough to figure it out. Thanks everyone! Keep checking in please!"
"Lovely to read all these comments , the world is a very sad world at the moment . Hopefully we will get through this stronger and wiser. Stay safe."
"Hi everyoneWhat a great post and how lovely to hear from you all, especially the regular ‘faces’, and to catch up despite so many sad stories.Like Steve said we are in a very good position here down under and our 'curve' is becoming nice and flat. Personally well we are hunkered down, and consider ourselves very lucky to live where we overlook the fabulous Broadwater where there is lots to see every day. We see loads of boats, sea life, birds, osprey nesting, and yesterday we had a wonderful ‘’sighting’’ of dolphins chasing fish very close by, so cannot complain, at least we get the odd ‘sighting’ to get excited about. Being now retired, staying home does not bother us at all, Skyping family and friends is not a problem, and twenty thousand plus photos to sort and get into photo books is a hobby I love. I am concerned about the amount of whingeing and whining about anything and everything, that now seems to be a new daily sport here, rather than accepting how lucky we actually are right now. The result is there appears to be mounting pressure on government to start to lift restrictions, way too soon in my view. Better safe than sorry, just my opinion. Our doctor said a couple of days ago overseas travel should not happen until next year, maybe he knows more than we do..Not a day goes by when we don’t shed tears for the images we see from around the world, we spent an amazing couple of months in Europe last year, such a wonderful trip, especially loved Italy and France, and heartbroken to see what is happening there. Have visited USA a couple of times, and it is astonishing to see the devastation happening, NY wow, it is just unthinkable. We got back from yet another Kruger trip just last December, and ache to return, but who knows when now, I cannot see us getting back for a long time, I am scared for South Africa. We are slowly recovering more funds from our cancelled June trip, thankfully we changed our flights from SAA to Qantas. Although it took eleven weeks, we got our refund from SAA just as the virus hit, and it seems if it was right now, it would be just a likely worthless voucher. So this is a year to focus on other things, yet still dream about future trips. I am loving reading, baking, walking the dog alongside the water, ‘playing’ with my photos, and learning new things online.Best wishes to everyone, take careEdited: 11:18 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"We booked our next winter trip for 2021 before the ""lockdowns"" happened and - as they say in Texas - ""god willing and the creek don't rise"" we expect to be in South Africa in FebruaryIn fact, I have been getting local advise on the road trip just to be sure on where we are going and how to get there, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdYs-rQ5t6c"
"Hi MTChandler, what is your itinerary for your next trip , you seem to have the knack of finding interesting places to visit . We still haven't been able to track down a Riel dance !"
"The only thing that we have confirmed for sure right now is 4 days in Robertson and the Breede Valley. My wife wanted to make sure that we celebrated Valentine's Day in our 50th wedding anniversary year at Ballinderry in Robertson and a visit to Silverthorn Wines. That is the only thing that is etched in stone right now. We have a number of relatives and friends back home in the States who are working on plans to join us on the trip. So, at the moment we are talking about what kinds of things they are interested in doing as a group and how much people want to go off on their own to explore."
"So happy to hear from more of you! Some interesting medical news this week. Hopefully some of the trials will work out and very effective treatments will become available soon. From experts, not politicians. Gratefully, I have a friend who is an epidemic expert - works in the field on outbreaks around the world as they happen. She knows how we need to get through this and is just now getting recognition and her expertise is being utilized. I’m optimistic. I love hearing from all of you! Being in NY I really appreciate the personal stories and plans for future trips to S Africa! It is truly scary here. Going to the grocery store used to be such a normal task, now it’s very hard. Getting better but will be a very long time before anything near normal. I’m grateful that anti poaching personnel are considered essential. SANParks posts pictures daily on Facebook and the webcams are up and running. The lodges and reserves post often so we can keep up with some of the places we love. The lions of Kruger even made People magazine! I hope we are careful when allowed to return. I’m sure many of you have seen this https:/…Can’t wait to go back! Please keep posting! #StayHome#PostponeDontCancel"
Yes its such a worry when going to get some basic food items is actually scary.cblr was it this year you were moving to SA?
"Thanks thesandmans. No, not for a couple of years, not yet retired (kind of retired right now though!). I’m so concerned for our beloved S Africa. Hopefully the current lockdown works but I worry that it’s winter soon. I live here. I’m in a medium blue town, my mom is in a dark blue town. I use this map and the John Hopkins world map for reference. So freaking scary https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavi…https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"
Oh my goodness that is beyond scary!
Yes. That’s why I like to hear how everyone is doing. I might be stuck home for a very long time! Both of us fall into the vulnerable category with the underlying health conditions. Today the pharmacy was quite the adventure. Thanks. Be safeEveryone keep posting! It’s great to hear from all of you! #StayHome#PostponeDontCancel
