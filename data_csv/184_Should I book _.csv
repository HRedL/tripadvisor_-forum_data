Since the schools areClosed for the next two weeks and I can’t work .... should I taken a trip on the fly ? The air is $218 each way including tax !!!! Sucks that it is on united and I won’t earn my Alaska miles but this is so cheap! Im very tempted - even if I only go for 9 or 10 days.

Of course not! Stay home!
Be part of the problem.
"I don't think anyone on this forum can (or at least should) tell you what to do. There are obviously benefits and risks associated with taking this trip. Different people would weigh those differently. (If you go, I hope you have a great time and that you stay healthy)"
2 tourists just confirmed to have COVID-19 on Kauai. How lucky do you feel?
I agree with onekbear.~ Colleen
Can you get tested at least once before getting on the plane? I'm thinking about the numbers in NY and the possibility that you will bring it with you.
I think I will just let this go and keep my thoughts and comment to myself...I posted them in post #1 and then decided to keep my thoughts to myself.I might just throw in a reminder about the Golden Rule.
"Schools are closed to help stop the spreading of this highly contagious virus, I can't believe you're thinking about traveling.I would actually like this virus to stop spreading but hey that's just me"
https://www.newsweek.com/young-unafraid-coro…
Nope
I read on the CDC website that they are highly recommending not to travel if it isn't essential. Check it out for yourself.
"Our friend booked a low round trip flight without much thought. Within a week the thoughts set in and he canceled . We could easily go right now too since my husband can work from a condo but I haven’t even considered it in the last couple weeks and it’s only a 5 hour flight for us. I’d love to go but I’m looking at the big picture. People aren’t going to their favorite restaurants down the street so flying 2,000 miles away doesn’t make sense to me. Plus are you still deciding whether or not to fly to California?"
Please stay home for your own sake and for the sake of others. You can travel later. We all need to pull together to defeat this virus.
Sciincalofornia - I already went on the trip to Big Sur amd Monterey . Since my SD trip is still a month away - I’m waiting to see if things get better .
"""People aren’t going to their favorite restaurants down the street so flying 2,000 miles away doesn’t make sense to me.""A reasonable conclusion provided you also agree that you shouldn't be going to your favorite restaurant down the street. But this is where ""facts, not fear"" seems to have brought us."
I’m amazed at people who don’t seem to have an understanding of what is happening. It’s not hard to pay attention or to temporarily make some life-adjustments. We all have a duty to each other.
"“A reasonable conclusion provided you also agree that you shouldn't be going to your favorite restaurant down the street. But this is where ""facts, not fear"" seems to have brought us.“I said some people aren’t going to their favorite restaurants, they may have good reasons, such as having underlying health issues and just aren’t comfortable with it. Restaurants in my town are setting up easy togo pick up because they are already hurting financially. We don’t have huge chain restaurants around here, most are small family owned and cozy. I don’t think people are comfortable with cozy right now. I don’t think it’s fear at all but comfort level. Two different things. Me? We picked up food from our favorite restaurant after a walk at the beach.Edited: 7:06 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"""I’m amazed at people who don’t seem to have an understanding of what is happening."" What makes you think you have a ""better understanding"" of what's happening than anyone else? Especially about ""what's happening"" in my world?"
"Well, I have the ability to not take a general statement and believe that it is specifically targeted at me..."
"Probably not according to what the CDC advises: https:/…travel-in-the-us.html It's all about the risk vs. benefit. Considering the situation we all are in, my HOPE is that all are putting the potential risk of others ahead of what benefits them. Kauai will always be there."
"Again with the shame police. The OP ASKED:"".... should I taken a trip on the fly ?' and people answered.And +1 for MikeL."
"I would not. To slow the spread of the virus and not overwhelm our healthcare systems, people need to stay home and minimize their contact with others as much as they possibly can, especially since there are some people that simply can't (healthcare workers, service workers, etc). Selfishly, I would also not want to risk getting sick while on Kauai. The healthcare services available on Kauai are not nearly as extensive as what is available to me at home, even accounting for the far larger population. I also do not live on an island and thus goods are able to reach my location much more quickly. We are tentatively hopeful that we will still be able to visit in June but we are prepared for that to not happen and understand that we will likely lose quite a bit of money. It sucks but this is an emergency."
"I'm simply amazed at people who are willing to travel right now. Even with that airfare from NYC, holy cow, what a deal. The thing to fear, is not having fear at all. Some of you might remember me trying to give some help to my best friend's daughter and her family. Going to Maui April 2-10. As of this minute, they are still going, 2 adults, 3 kids. (Not my friend). Their kids are now out of school because Michigan schools are closed for 3 weeks. The mom of the family took the kids to the mall !! Schools are closed to help with social distancing. So let's go to the mall. And let's still go to Maui. This whole thing is no longer about making a decision on what's best for each individual and their family. We are faced with this pandemic as a whole society. Thinking individually NOW, isn't going to work!! I'm not understanding why that's so hard to comprehend."
"Because its political. For the last three months 50% of the population has been told this is no worse than a mild cold. Only a few thousand people have died. This is all a media ""hysteria."" It's fake news, meant to embarrass their president. And they are used to being ""in the know"" because for the last X years they have been told to not trust experts. Civil war was about states rights. Global warming is a hoax made by scientists and ""experts"" to profit. ACA is a communist takeover. And they just hate it when all the pointy headed elites 'talk down to them."" After all, everyone's opinion is equally valid, a high school educated welder knows as much as an MD right, especially when the welder watches Fox News. Why would anybody be surprised this is happening?"
Plus one to Kaeleku.
"Kinda sums it all up, eh?"
"I am surprised not by the politics of it but the casual attitude (denial?) about the unprecedented (in recent history) closing down of institutions for a pandemic. Also surprising are people ignoring advisories by the CDC against non essential travel. What would the definition of essential travel be then? I understand that this attitude is a byproduct of living in a ""free"" society. I am also free to comment about it.Edited: 12:02 am, March 15, 2020 "
Another case on Oahu.
"As someone who is currently advocating for and assisting in the suspension of an institution, I can say with confidence that civil liberties are neither being abridged nor considered in our suspension. That may seem difficult to square to some folks, but it is the reality. It’s also extraordinarily simple, once the decision is made."
"Plus 2 to Kaeleku. I wasn’t going to comment on this anymore until I read your post.  I try to help out on the California forum which is always busy. Lately I just point out everything that is currently closed, from Disneyland to Hamilton in SF. There is no way cities on the mainland would be limiting crowds to 250 people and a place that draws thousands of visitors and their money like Disneyland would be closing if this wasn’t something to take very seriously. It’s a different advising people in California since a lot of what they come here for is closed and winter finally returned so there isn’t a lot to do outdoors yet."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!Please don’t travel unless you have to.We have only about 70,000 residents here and we are all just as susceptible as the rest of the world.Many places are closing down also, and any events, farmers markets, as well as others, will be shutting down for a month or two.Malama Pono,Janet"
I have my regularly scheduled trip booked for the summer so it’s not a big deal to not go . I have a home on island so if I’m going to be on lock down of course I’d rather it be there then in a concrete jungle. We have only been out to stock up on lots of groceries and necessities. It’s cold here and sucks to be inside. Hope this hysteria ends soon.
"We booked a condo months ago through VRBO. It was non-cancellable and so far the owner has told us that he will not refund our money or even allow us to re-book at a later date. If he holds firm, we will be making sure that many people are informed to avoid his rental property on the island."
"Kavak, I'm kind of surprised you even posted the question here. You must have known the forum response would be don't do it. If you felt you had to ask you probably are leaning towards not going so don't go. In the end it's your call."
https:/…travel-in-the-us.html fyi
"""Hope this hysteria ends soon""?????Would that be the ever-increasing number of known cases, the rising number of deaths, or?Please......don't travel. We have finally hit the starting gate in Hawaii, and the exponential rise will begin."
"Yeah it’s cold here in Chicago too! And being home with two bored teens has been challenging to say the least! Would I even consider traveling right now? Absolutely not! We are booked for June but prepared to cancel. Try to look at the bright side - time with your kids without the constant interruptions of social gatherings, sports, homework. This will pass but we all need to do our part. Stay home."
Napa - I am leaning towards not going. I have a trip booked in July which I am not canceling . I do have another trip booked to CA in 3 weeks which I have yet to cancel. I will access the situation when I am a week away.
"Well, I can pretty much guarantee you that the situation will be worse 3 weeks from now, not better.But sure, why not wait ? Some miracle could occur....I guess (and I hope)."
"If the state of Hawaii does not want people to travel to Hawaii during this time, maybe the state should enact emergency legislation requiring all hotels and rental accommodations to provide refunds if requested, or to agree on mutually acceptable rescheduled dates. I am not sure if such a law would be unconstitutional under the Contract Clause. But for many people, the amount they paid in advance for accommodations represents an enormous loss, and I imagine those people would be more likely to cancel if they could get a refund or reschedule their stay. Of course, I do not know whether the State of Hawaii wants to discourage visitors -- I don't know how the State balances the health risks associated with having many visitors against the economic impact of tourists staying home."
"Greece closed all restaurants and bars last week. Now they’ve closed all holiday hotels and developed beaches, you pay a few € for a lounge. Holiday hotels run from Greek Easter to mid October usually. Regular hotels will stay open. They are taking this very seriously. This is the beginning of a very busy season so it’s very hard for the country to miss out on this money. They need it. In California all bars and wineries are closing and the rumors is restaurants aren’t far behind. I can’t see Hawaii or California closing hotels but maybe it’s the thing to do. I feel like Hawaii is having a harder time because so many things people come to Hawaii for is outdoors and it’s hard to stop people from coming until it’s impossible to do so. Humans aren’t great at self regulating.Edited: 7:17 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I stated this on another thread but to me the BIG concern is all the small business closures that will happen if tourism slows in Hawaii. Many locals live paycheck to paycheck, if they get their hours cut or worse the business closes then what do they do.Many of these small businesses don't have a large reserve of cash on hand to hold them over for several months.I know here where we live hubby had 3 real estate deals blow up in the last week. One gentleman was a Delta pilot got his pay cut 45%, bank killed that deal fast.It's just going to be sad to see these beautiful little shops close for good."
"Sad, but also sad if people keep traveling and then that spreads covid faster such that hospitals are overwhelmed and have to ration respirators. It is just a world tragedy. But I am still doing my taxes today, lol. If I owe, maybecwait to pay until the 15th in case I die first, lol not lol. I am high risk."
"We booked Friday after canceling an international trip and cancelled yesterday. In the end, I couldn’t live with the thought of buying up food and supplies at the stores in Hawaii and potentially depriving a full time resident of those things when I have a fully stocked house at home. It seemed incredibly selfish and insensitive to try to have a vacation in paradise in the middle of a world crisis. That said, we had disagreement within our family over the decision and I know several families who flew to the islands yesterday (our school is on spring break) and they said the flight was 90% full."
"Hearing that is discouraging. Especially since the newest case of our confirmed cases is a woman from Colorado that is now in isolation. I have a large number of family members in Colorado, and the number of infections there are rising rapidly. One family of retired seniors are already staying home. I applaud your decision. There's a chance your family members could end up not getting home for awhile or getting quarantined upon arrival back!!"
"Colorado has been hit hard because of our tourism industry. It took the governor ordering the shut down of the ski resorts to stop people from continuing to come out. If you look at the Colorado forum, people are still posting things like “ideas of things to do in Breckenridge when the mountain is closed.” It is crazy to me that people would still want to come here when our infection rate is high (and would be much higher but for the fact they haven’t been able to do adequate testing). All of these things are true for Hawaii as well. Yes, it hurts to eat prepaid fees, but that is nothing compared to how awful it would feel to know you were part of the problem."
"It's already hitting hard here in CT, there are many small businesses that are closing up shop ""Permanently"" due to the uncertainty and the new laws put in place (no more than 50 people at one gathering, NO restaurant eat-in, take out ONLY, no outdoor food vending/sitting, no unnecessary travel, etc. etc). I'm sure Kauai will be the same way if they panic the same way they did here.I now my husband keeps telling me I need to put things in perspective, that only 70 people in the whole US have passed from this since it was discovered 3 MONTHS ago, while 70 people PER DAY pass from the regular flu that has been around for MANY years.He also stated that the number of tests is WAY low, once they start handing out tests and see ALL the people that actually have this virus (and are NOT dying) the mortality rate will be MUCH better so the 3% number will be more like .01%. I just hope Hawaii gets through this unscathed so they can continue on as normal."
"""Especially since the newest case of our confirmed cases is a woman from Colorado that is now in isolation.""Is not correct. The Colorado woman was confirmed by both CO doctors and HI. doctors to NOT have it when she was here in Hawaii.Fran, maybe you and your husband should read the Surgeon General's statement about our status.......as in the US is where Italy was 2 weeks ago.Edited: 1:31 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"""I know several families who flew to the islands yesterday (our school is on spring break) and they said the flight was 90% full.""Frustrating, isn't it? I know a couple of families who have canceled upcoming spring break trips to Hawaii, and our trip to New Orleans has gone by the wayside. I'm swimming upstream trying to convince college kids not to jump on travel deals and head to Cabo or HI. Meanwhile, some families are responding to our six week (minimum) school closure by doing just that. ~ Colleen"
"We have a family business in Kauai that rents out cars and is almost 100% dependent on tourists. I read the questions people face and the reactions and I ask myself how unlikely we react when facing a worldwide threat. It is one of those do we stay or do we go questions that just might change our lives. It seems even bigger than that and then I remind myself that no one is immune. But there is one thing where we still have 100% control of and that is how empowered we feel as human beings. Common sense is the idea and to not delude ourselves because we are infected by fear.Maybe ask yourself not what to do BUT WHY YOU CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING. Let what drives you in your heart guide your decisions, not other people."
Sadly our first *official* community spread case was just confirmed on Oahu.....a young tour guide at Kualoa Ranch.No one is immune.
What a great idea.I am so sorry you will not earn your Alaska miles.Enjoy your trip.
"We are in a similar situation. Kid out of school, I'm on a short leave. We're going to live life, but not without caution. The response to the situation is beyond exaggerated, companies fearing liability, politicians of all stripe fearing backlash.Twenty years of hardcore fearmongering and dystopian media has produced an unrealistic world viewpoint in North America.. To live a life of no risk at all is sad."
"Mark, so sorry you're inconvenienced. I know it's got to be very hard for you. Not everyone has the ability to understand what is happening and why. You'll just have to trust those who are able understand to help people like yourself make better decisions."
"Mitsos49's post needs air quotes, e.g. ""great"" idea. Mark, I hear what you're saying and agree to an extent. We live in a litigious society, which can dictate choices. Political follow-the-leader is real. Social media coupled with standard media hype can overwhelm and lead people astray. And of course, life involves an element of risk ~ or should, anyway. But I trust you can vet sources and rely on trustworthy information. I trust you can see the common views and advice expressed in those sources. And as you do so, you'll likely realize that this reaction is by no means limited to North America. Claiming this is cultural is plain wrong.~ Colleen"
"No, you should not book."
"I would and its a great deal. Be careful of course , because cowards will talk you out of a good adventure. I almost gave up an amazing trip to the Philippines due to the nonsense the media was spouting about Duterte.The amazing thing about a crisis is that it drives prices down. Flights, hotels, stocks etc. GO FOR IT!"
"well just remember, you would be going somewhere where you ARE NOT WELCOME. The tourists that are on Kaua'i right now are looked at with contempt."
"I agree with Mark that it is certainly a cultural problem. America is no longer the land of the free and home of the brave. It is now the land of whipped dogs and this Corona outbreak proves it. Enjoy living life through that television of yours. Lets just shut down the internet, because misinformation is helping to spread the virus according to WHO. They call it an infodemic. Blaque"
2 more new cases on Oahu........state total as of noon is 16.Hawaii public schools are now closed until at least April 7th.
"""I agree with Mark that it is certainly a cultural problem.""Blaqueheart, Mark suggested that our response to the pandemic is a byproduct of an ""unrealistic world viewpoint in North America"". Aside from the fact that North America extends beyond this one nation, our concerns and response aren't unlike those of many countries around the world.  If you find that you're drowning in the infodemic, vet your sources and rely on those that are trustworthy. Can't speak to what's coming across on television since sports are all I watch ~ or not, just now.~ Colleen"
They would really hate Kaua'i now.....a mandatory curfew...........
"No! We are here and cutting our trip short. First of all, all the bars and restaurants are closed. The takeout said they will close soon. Second, it is raining like crazy, all day, no sun. Last, the roads are closed and flooded that access the north part of the island. All tours are cancelled. This place is shut down."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!Please click this for today’s message from Mayor Derek- implementing curfews starting Friday and also about visitors: https:/…Malama Pono,Janet"
"Wow Janet:<“ Also Wednesday, the mayor said that airline travel to and from Kauai will be limited to essential needs.“Until further notice, visitors should not be traveling to our island for recreational purposes,” he said. “Kauai is on vacation.”>"
Mayor of Kauai announced today that due to the coronavirus Kauai is on vacation and stronglyrecommends that visitors not come.
He can't stop airlines from landing. But he can and has made it clear people need to stop visiting until this is done or much better.
"""The tourists that are on Kaua'i right now are looked at with contempt.""I'm sure that's true. In fact, I know it's true. Let's look at the other side of the coin. The mood about the virus has changed dramatically in Hawaii in just the past couple of days.. I had a good friend there and HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE FOR 3 WEEKS before this all blew up. Just 4 days ago he communicated to me that his trip was going well and he said he really didn't see anything different happening other than the farmer's markets just closing up. Other than it seemed like everything was pretty normal to him. Fast forward to yesterday when he called and said they got on an early flight out, the red eye last night. He said it took a dramatic turn South and he was well aware that he should not be there and paid out a good amount to change their flights to leave the island early.He did his part yet he said he still encountered nasty looks even and a couple of comments from strangers even as he was getting ready to exit the island. Maybe they didn't know he was flying OUT but there's no excuse for that. My point is to keep in mind that many tourists still there arrived before the proverbial S--- hit the fan. And many of them have no choice but to wait for their return flights. My guess is flights leaving Kauai are more full than flights going there. At least I would hope that's the case. So I'm asking that we not put all tourists there in the category of being irresponsible jerks. I also don't believe the comments that the tourists there are not practicing social distancing. I'm sure there are some that aren't and I'm sure there are locals who also are not.This isn't a time for people to start tearing each other down and making broad general sweeping accusations against any one group of people.Edited: 12:56 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Well said, Napa.~ Colleen"
"I have little issue with people who came here before the proverbial poop hit the fan, so long as they observe social distancing and other new requirements that have been put in place. My issue is with people who still insist on traveling here when the government is asking for a halt to discretionary travel. Watching the local news tonight was a wholly infuriating experience, as they interviewed the schmucks who felt the needed to take advantage of $179 airfares, or the others who said they couldn't change their flights so they had to come. There is no airline not waiving their fees if you have yet to start travel.Hubby and I actually haven't left the house since last Thursday, will venture out tomorrow as we do need some fresh food and also want to grab some take-out from where we typically spend our Thursday evenings. Curious to see what it feels like out there."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!Well as far as saying visitors here ARE social distancing- I have to say this.I live here - every time I have ventured out for groceries or as today - another futile search for TP, I see people (mostly visitors) who are not behaving responsibly. Today was just another case in point - at Long’s there were many visitors and I can definitely tell you that no one I saw was social distancing- you get in line and people in back of me were as close as they normally are. Aisles the same - I actually had to go down each aisle to find one that didn’t have people with carts and kids (who were coughing with no attempt to cover their mouths - not the keiki’s fault - the parents.It was the same at Big Save - I only went in to see if they had tp (no store I went to did)....but there were so many visitors in the small aisles that I just went out without anything.Sueoka Store was the only one that people were keeping a distance - it was not busy at all and the people that were there (locals and some visitors) have wide berths to anyone else.Obviously we can’t make a generality, but it seems many visitors here now for whatever reason - are not understanding the warnings, or disregarding. And yes I am sure some residents are guilty of this too.With the curfew and our Mayor saying no non essential travel to Kaua’i - I am sure some residents are getting irritated to see visitors out and about when most of us are only going out for exercise and groceries. Malama Pono,Janet"
"If they want to STOP folks from going to Hawaii they need to have the airlines STOP the discounts.A lady I work with just booked her family of 4 for the second week in April 2020 for a total of less than $1500 for all four people (non-refundable of course).I just looked, Connecticut to HNL is $376 ROUNDTRIP per person on United.The governor needs to tell the airlines to knock it off.But double edge sword, no tourism no revenue."
"I agree about the airlines. Some people can’t pass up a deal to save their lives. We could go right now and stay with my very good friend. I don’t even need to take up space at a hotel or condo. No way. I don’t want spread it possibly and I really feel like it’s a time to stay home. Cuddle with my cats. Plus who wants to look like the idiots in Florida?!I’m hoping with the mayors getting stricter rules people will stop coming. Our tourists, mostly the families, started leaving once restaurants were take out only, attractions started closing and the Shelter in Place sounds serious. Although I think a lot of Bay Area people are choosing to SIP in our nicer hotels because the rates are still very high."
Think the feds should not offer bailouts to airlines giving low fares during this time. People should not be traveling for non essential reasons.
"As a physician, I implore people do not visit Kauai(or any of the islands) at this point. Community spread IS happening, even if only one case on Oahu has been identified so far. Adding more possibly infected people to the population will only increase the opportunities for community spread and potentially tax the healthcare system more than it already will be. Mitigation efforts (closing schools, bars, sit down restaurants, gyms. Not allowing events with greater than 50 attendees, encouraging telecommuting where possible) will decrease the rate of community spread. Early action is essential. The first case of community spread on the mainland was identified on 2/26. Serious containment efforts weren’t instituted until mid March, .The scariest statistic for me was in a post on FB stating the number of critical care beds available on Kauai. There are 9 according to 2017 statistics. Kauai has a population of about 70,000, about 6,500 people are over 70 and about 2,700 are over 85(groups at highest risk for severe disease and need for critical care ICU beds). If beds are full, patients can’t just be transferred by ambulance to the next town, as may be possible on the mainland. Visitors ,please stay home, and residents follow guidelines for containment measures. Aloha from NJ."
"No, you should not book. Please do not put our residents at further risk. We have limited resources on these islands. Current news: ""Lt. Gov. Josh Green is calling for the suspension of all non-essential travel to Hawaii and the closure of all businesses and schools until April 30 to prevent a mass outbreak of the coronavirus in the islands."""

I already stated 50 posts ago that I decided not to go and I’m glad I did .
