"Glenn Jones, Bermuda Tourism Authority Interim CEO on how the international tourism industry is preparing for post Covid-19 travel. Story on @boston25: https:/…Edited: 10:57 am, May 06, 2020 "
"""...Hope springs eternal...""....especially in the tourism industry these days.But Mr. Jones is right. Bermuda has always enjoyed a well deserved reputation for well ordered cleanliness and stability....and a proximity (2 hour flight times) to major US eastern seaboard gateway cities.Though it's a helluva' stretch....Bermuda may even benefit from the residual affect of having been a ZIKA-free vacation destination these past several years. Never underestimate the influence of irrational association."

"Ordinarily, I don't have much sympathy for Bermuda's Tourist Authority....but if there's ever a competition, I'd nominate Glenn Jones for having one of the most UN-enviable jobs in Bermuda,,,(though in retrospect when offered the interim CEO post, he now wishes he answered that Want Ad to become a trainee Septic Tank Diver instead)."
