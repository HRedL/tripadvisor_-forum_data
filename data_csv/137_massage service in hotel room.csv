"Hello,We (couple) are planning a holiday (post COVID-19) in Phuket, Krabi and Pattaya. Can you please suggest some decent resort/hotel/villa, which provide massage service in hotel room and allow both male and female therapist? Just want to relax with the comfort of the room, instead of going hotel spa/outside."
"You’re expecting to receive hotel recommendations in three different places and you have not provided a budget per night in Thai baht.Prices vary according to the season, but you don’t say when you intend to travel."
‘ post COVID-19‘Please enlighten us when that will be.
"My budget would be 2000-3000 Thai baht per night.My original plan was in May 2020 end. Tough flight tickets has not booked. May be I will travel in May-June only, if everything under control w.r.t COVID-19.btw, thanks for your response, and sorry for not mentioning all expectation pointers in original post :)"
"At your budget there might be some hotels with an in house spa that offers massage in the room but usually in house spas are found in more expensive hotels, say Thb 5,000 upwards. But many massage shops offer an outcall service, usually a bit more expensive than service within the shop itself. So imo you need a hotel that will permit outcall massage services to visit. The hotel might even have an arrangement with such an establishment. The masseur/masseuse might need to deposit their ID card at reception for the duration of the visit.So your partner wants a masseur and you need a masseuse? Sounds like could be a fun session.Edited: 4:50 am, March 16, 2020 "
"@ KhunBill - Thanks. Yes, I have also heard about the ID card rule for out-call massage. Fun is a different aspect. Lets see, if i am able to get such hotel/resort name with this budget."
No problem Amit. Use booking.com or similar. Before booking email the hotel and ask if they admit outcall massage. For your budget you will be able to get some perfectly acceptable accommodation.
"Surely massage services should have been stopped, with all this talk about not touching and keeping distance from other people???"
Come on Jim ! TIT !
TIT? What does that mean?
This is Thailand...
Thank you Dodger. I thought that all regular contributors would have known that. How many tens of thousands of Thais are involved in the massage industry? How many massage establishments are owned by what are euphemistically known in Thailand as 'influential people'?
