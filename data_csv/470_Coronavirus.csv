"Hello, I am traveling to Barcelona in 15 days. I am Chinese but from USA. Are chinese people not welcomed? Or feared to carry the coronavirus? I can’t wear a T-shirt saying I’m not from China but actually am American everyday I’m there."
"There are 70,000 Chinese people in Barcelona. I would not worry about this and enjoy your trip."
You will not be discriminated against in Barcelona. The Chinese have many small stores in the city.
"With the number of Chinese running bars these days, such a fear would make the city go thirsty and hungry in a matter of hours. And nobody is going to let that happen... ;-)))"

"looks like I will be there about a week before you. I will add comments during my stay there. We are planning to go and looking forward to the trip, obviously with sensible precautionary steps"
"Stop discriminating against yourself to start. Visit just like any other normal people do. In the rare case where you might get some unpleasant comments, just chalk it up to ignorance and move on."
Just finished our trip and headed back. Absolutely loved it and we had NO issues whatsoever. It’s actually one of the friendliest cities we’ve visited. All of the restaurant and the shops were very friendly and welcoming. Definitely coming back!

How is right now ? we are planning to go to barcelona in the beginning of March.
"How is what right now? Are people avoiding Chinese/Asians? I think that they are more worried about Italians... :-)Edited: 10:22 am, February 25, 2020 "

"Sadly, this is going to get worse before it gets better. The outbreak in Northern Italy has definitely caught everyone by surprise and many are now wondering whether they should put international travel on hold until things stabilize."
"The first case in Barcelona was confirmed today. I am also planning travel to Barcelona in two weeks, and we're also Americans of Asian descent. I was previously just worried about the anti-Asian sentiment, but now my fears are actually about getting infected, especially due to Barcelona's proximity to Italy. If the cases stay isolated, I'm not worried, but if there is a sudden outbreak in Barcelona (very possible imo) then I'd be scared. Any opinions?Edited: 12:11 pm, February 25, 2020 "

"L_Slatkin,You're right, which is why I'm not extremely worried right now. The cases in the US are relatively (extremely) isolated and spread out right now.

Barcelona could be the center of another outbreak, easily.Edited: 12:33 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"@jwech. If you have not already done so, you may wish to check the terms and conditions of your travel insurance.I also suspect most airlines have a response for travelers who are asking about re-scheduling or canceling flights due to the current situation. I would not wait until the last moment to see what your options are."
"@55nrdtofly, Thanks for the guidance. I've already checked in with my insurance provider and they said there's no coverage except for illness or quarantine. My travel agency says that nothing can really be done until special guidance is posted for Barcelona (ie if it gets worse there). They are just starting to deal with travelers to Italy."

Thank you TripsWithDad. I used the STEP link. I'm not overly concerned at this point but would like to stay informed.
I am booked to go to Barcelona in 10 days time for a 5 day holiday visit. But just found out tonight of someone testing positive for this Corona virus. I dont know what to do dear friends! Anyone has advice?
"There is no point worrying about it at the moment, it is 1 person.Should the situation escalate then you might want to rethink your plans.My advise would be to read the guidelines on the WHO website & educate yourself."
"We cancelled our trip to Barcelona scheduled for March 12-15 due to my in-laws' health issues. I have to confess that we were also concerned about how rapidly the coronavirus is spreading in Italy, and now there is one confirmed case in Barcelona. Most medical experts share the opinion that this virus will continue spreading and will likely reach pandemic levels in the near future. If you're concerned, and your travel plans are flexible, then you could cancel or change your plans until the picture is clearer. If your trip cannot be changed or cancelled, be sure to check your travel insurance policy and/or credit card trip cancellation provisions regarding what constitutes a valid reason for getting a refund. Most policies will not cover epidemics or pandemics, but will cover illness, injury or death of the travel party and his/her family members who may not be traveling with you. Some policies will also cover jury duty, subpoenas, etc.If you proceed with your trip, have a good time in lovely Barcelona while taking any necessary precautions."
What about museums? Do they work? I am so worried about it.
"If you really are the type of person that worries so much, you should probably stay at home. Why go on holiday if you are going to be miserable all the time?And in case you really want to know the facts: there is nothing in Barcelona right now that is closed or limited because of this virus. (Yes, the Mobile World Congress was cancelled. But lots of participants are in the city anyway and are having meetings and events.)Edited: 10:26 am, February 26, 2020 "
"ahha, yes, I would stay at home wherever that is if you are so worried.Edited: 12:14 pm, February 26, 2020 "
Here is an interesting take on it:https://www.youtube.com/watch…Let's see if it is taken down!
We are booked to go next week and also questioning whether we should go or not.
"@Jacqueline168, there are 14 cases in the UK at the moment. Unless you are planning to stay at home for the next few weeks, why wouldn't you travel to Barcelona? I think this is crazy."
Here is an American Embassy advisory: https:/…
I am on vacation in Barcelona right now with my family. My whife is Asian too. Don‘t worry. A liot of Asians are working in Barcelona and they are part of the city.
"I'm due to travel on 9th March. Unless my flight is cancelled, I still intend to go and enjoy my holiday."
Is anyone cancelling their trip due to the infected woman? This will be our first 3 days away from our kids for 6 years...everything is planned...but I wonder if its worth it to go?

"Eilina... where the heck do you think you are travelling? to a war zone? for God's sake, life is as usual in Barcelona."
"To advert panic, here are a couple of interesting links:https:/…https:/…"
"Roxy r, I don't think that this is the forum to discuss (conspiracy) theories regarding this virus. (This is not your first post with such links...)What you believe, and whether there is any truth to those theories, is of no importance to someone planning to travel to Barcelona and trying to get some information on what the situation there is.And to be complete: right now there is no ""situation"" here, as said by several posters already..."
"Exactly! I totally agree 'there is no situation' yet some people on here are being whipped up into panic and cancelling or expecting a war zone. LOL! (Eilina)'What I believe' you are not party to, but I do think looking at all information helps create a more balanced view, rather than depending solely upon links to newspapers, or US Embassy advice, thus reducing irrational decisions . For example looking at the statistics in the first link, with the conclusion: 'Essentially, unless you are either elderly or already sick, there’s very little chance you are in danger.' reassuring, is it not, and should not be dismissed as a 'conspiracy theory'!IMHO"
"While I think it is appropriate to ask for advice on train schedules, restaurants and the like in this space, seeking advice as to whether you should cancel a trip because of a health issue is probably not a very sound approach. Those seeking this advice have not done their homework, and those giving this advice are really not qualified to do so. Curious to see whether anyone wants to weigh in on this.Edited: 8:22 am, February 28, 2020 "
Thank you Enric and others for your reassurance! Good to know life is as usual in Barcelona! Although I do not believe that I am traveling to an actual WAR ZONE there are some things other than actual WAR that can make my trip less enjoyable..For example...if some of the best seafood restaurants or sagrada familia decide to close to the public for a few days...that's not WAR but it's worse than it could be...I'm not really asking for advise on cancelling my trip but on what's happening in Barcelona so thank you for reassuring me that all is well!
Good on you! We're flying out on March 2nd and feel the same way you do! Have a great trip!
"Thanks, Enrik - we'll be in beautiful Barcelona on March 3. Salut!"

Mehmet U - Troll!
Note that there are two threads running on this issue with very similar advice being given.Enjoy the CityAnthony
localspain.es is a very good source for corona virus. They are on facebook or you can simply reach them on the Internet.
"if that is a good place for coronavirus then better avoid it, even if you use a mask."
"Hi,i should come to Barcelona 4.4.is everithing work normaly?"
"Yes.But are you really asking this for a date more than a month from now...? That's a bit useless, don't you think?Edited: 3:38 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Hey all, i am from Austria and i am travelling to Barcelona in 4 weeks. Is it safe there or should i cancel the whole trip. I am not quit sure what i should think about the different opinions! Would ask for your opinion! Thanks a lot have a great day :)"
"Another one... ""in 4 weeks""... How do you expect anyone to give you a meaningful answer now?"
"Todays answer would be for travellers to go to Barcelona, bearing in mind that usual hygiene standards must be met by every individual. As said, who knows what April may bring.CheersAnthony"
"@Laura M, nobody will be able to tell you if you are going to be safer in Austria or in Barcelona n 4 weeks. Personally, I think this whole issue has been taken way out of proportion by the media (who know where they will be like when the real one arrives) so I will definitely go to wherever I had booked and don't cancel my well-earned holidays :-)"
Agree with Sputrip. Curious to see how people and the media will react if one day Ebola-on-steroids gets released into the world... :-)
"Hello guys,I intend to fly to Barcelona on 14 March till 23 March. Highlights will be the Barcelona vs Napoli CL game. However, I admit I'm a bit worried whether is it safe to travel to Barcelona and attend the game. Or what if, I do travel and finally the game is played behind closed doors! What would you guys advise me?Many thanks from beautiful Mauritius Island! :)"
"Flight information from airlines is being updated regularly, at present. I would keep an eye on your Airlines news pages.As for the football match against an Italian side, I have not heard of a cancellation at present but it might happen. Contact Barcelona FC and ask the question. https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/contact … for all contact information.CheersAnthony K"
"if you travel and the match is suspended or played behind closed doors you still can visit the city.is it safe visit barcelona? right now i think that the main concern that a healthy person should have is related to quarentine, lock outs and border closings.it is a minimal risk but one must think if they can cope with that without problems. for exampke, what would happen if Mauritius authorities decide that all those coming from abroad might stay in quarentine? would that be a problem for you?"
"Hello, we currently are in Barcelona. Everything is totally fine. People are calm, regarding food all 100% good. I wouldn't worry too much after all out of 5 million people in Barcelona ONLY 3 people had coronavirus"
"Yup, the authorities here are regularly reviewing list of countries which are being placed on ""red"" list. From what I heard recently is that France will be placed on that list. That is, all visitors from France having symptoms will be placed in quarantine. As such, there are high chances that visitors from Spain might be place in quarantine too.For the Barca v Napoli game, it is looking highly likely that the game will be played behind closed doors. From what I read, the Spanish govt is recommending same."
"@ Saan D, do you mind pointing us to any information that states that ""the Spanish govt is recommending same"" (about playing the game behind closed doors)?You seem to have inside information from both yours and the Spanish government. But as far as I can tell, your info regarding the football game is wrong, so I also have my doubts about the rest of your information (for now)."
"Also interested to know the source of this! I travel to a few Barcelona games each year, so if that WAS the case, I would cancel the trip for the Napoli game - but this is the first mention I've seen of being played behind closed doors..."
"Yes sure,here are the links:https:/…44ad19a77667https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/ba…As far as I know, there are 2 games which has been CONFIRMED to be played behind closed doors: Getafe vs Inter and Valencia v Atalanta."
"This looks like a wrong interpretation on the part of the writers of those articles. As one of text says, the government has advised playing behind closed doors games with teams from high risk zones, like the north of Italy. Napoli is not in the north of Italy.It does not mean that things cannot evolve. Maybe at some point the same advice will be given for the Barça game, but we are not at that point yet.I think that we should stick to facts, if we really want to help visitors to Barcelona.Edited: 8:25 am, March 04, 2020 "
it seems that Israel ordered quarantine for those arriving from Spain:https:/…if other countries do the same it could have a huge impact on tourist related business.
"The number of cases of Coronavirus are increasing quite quickly in the UK. Watch news reports and Foreign Office UK Govt advice, for Spain, to see if there are any updates about visiting Spain or if they act by refusing to accept visitors from the UK.At present there is no such news. CheersAnthony K"
"For what it’s worth, my son just flew from the UK to Barcelona last week and returned to London yesterday with no issues at all. No extra security or controls of any kind on either end. I am nervous about his coming back for Spring break in a month, but we’ll see how things are then.As others have said, everything in Barcelona is normal. Stores are normal, no hoarding or empty shelves as I’ve heard about in other places. I haven’t seen any fewer people on the streets, or any masks."
"We're from California traveling to France, Spain and Italy for 3 weeks starting April 5th. We're obviously rethinking Italy but Barcelona is still on the agenda. My #1 bucket list item is to see my FC Barca play at Camp Nou and we bought expensive tickets for the game April 12th. Fingers crossed we can still go...and we're going until the authorities say we can't! We'll make a decision in 2-3 weeks. No sense in stressing about it yet. Good luck everyone!"
Same here. Our biggest fear is getting stuck or quarantined when we arrive back at LAX or worse overseas. We will re-access a week before our planned flight - last week of March.
Heading there at the end of the month and not too worried at this moment. Only thing of concern is not being able to see places like the Sagrada Familia.
"andrea--I appreciate the firsthand report. I am not an alarmist at all, and I want to correct what may be misinformation. According to CDC, WHO, and thelocal.es, there are 22 confirmed cases in Province of Barcelona. Not 3. That number changes all the time, of course.And I'm flying out on Saturday. Plans have not changed at all."
"20-something cases in an area of more than 5 million inhabitants. Even if those 20 are only 10% of the actual number, the chance of running into one of them is still rather small...The real risk (and potential damage) is indeed in the overreaction of both authorities and companies, not in the disease itself.For what it's worth: my European trips out and in Barcelona this week have been trouble free. But 2 of my flights next week have been cancelled already. It could be a coincidence, but I hope that it's not a sign of things to come...."
We've regretfully cancelled our trip. We were due to arrive in Barcelona on March 11 through the 14th. It's just too risky due to the uncertainty/how fast the situation is changing and the fact that cases re growing extremely quickly.
I have cancelled my trip i was going out on Wednesday. It’s really not worth it things are definitely going to get worse. I’m not putting myself out in public places as I would have been going to an event full of random people from all over the world. Instead il use the money I would have spent on holiday on supplies instead. Things are going to get worse before they get better.
"@kbbcn:""20-something cases in an area of more than 5 million inhabitants.

Affected individuals are in isolation, following Spanish medical protocols. These are in addition to the two cases that were previously confirmed earlier this month.Actions to Take: For Information: Call 061 (if you are in Spain) for medical assistance/questions concerning COVID-19 in Spain. Consult the Spanish Health Ministry and CDC website for updates.Review the Department of State’s COVID-19 Travel Alert.Check with your hotel, airline, other service provider regarding cancellations related to COVID-19."
These appear to be the latest figures and distribution of confirmed cases tonight across the whole of Spain.https:/…2004681.shtml
"This is a ridiculous discussion (to be polite about it). The only useful information anyone on this board can give is the current state of affairs in Barcelona. And that continues to be completely normal. As someone in the very high risk category (asthma, chronic bronchitis) I am doing what feels safe based on everything I’ve read. I’m washing my hands often and avoiding situations where I have to be in extremely close contact with people for extended periods of time (I canceled my dentist appointment, for example). But going out and taking the Metro and bus feels just as safe as always, as does eating out and doing other normal activities. Is Barcelona safer than wherever you are right now? I have no idea. Spain has a lot more confirmed cases than the US, but a lot fewer deaths. But again, those are today’s numbers. who knows what tomorrow will bring?"
"Post 89 and any from Barcelona residents or visitors, at this time, are very welcome.ThanksAnthony K"
"Here a resident, when (if!) the discussion stops being speculative and focuses on useful information for soon-to-be visitors I will gladly chip in if I have something useful to add... otherwise it's a waste of time for the most part -with the exception of some contributions to date."
"I think that we have already indicated that it's pretty much business as usual in Barcelona. Right now, if you'd have no access to the media, you would not even realise during a visit to Barcelona that something was going on.Of course, visitors also need to worry about travel in and out of the city (flights cancellations etc.), and possible restrictions and quarantine when they return. But the situation in Barcelona itself is absolutely no reason to cancel a visit right now."
"We’re booked to go to Barcelona on April 5 then drive to Basque Country then cross to France and spend a week in Provence then drive back to Barcelona and fly home. Total 18 days. Made the trip several times before. Given the hourly news re. coronavirus updates, we’re seriously considering postponing the trip until things get resolved."
"Med FYour trip is still some time off. I wouldn't take any negative action at the present time.The only thing I would offer, as advice, is that it may be more important to look at the French part of your trip than that in Spain.CheersAnthony"
"tbh, I think that your main problem might be getting back into the US after your trip to Europe. Your president is being quite aggressive and does not want any big numbers of sufferers in 'his' country, especially if it not 'his fault'"
"Me and my boyfriend are traveling to Barcelona in a few weeks, given the situation doesn’t get worse. I was worried for him facing racism, but I’m also worried that major tourist sites might get closed. Also, if we get exposed to the virus I don’t know if the US will let him back in since he’s just staying on a student visa. The airlines will only refund us if the WHO declares a state of emergency so I’m not sure what to do at this point."
"Racism?... never hear that, sorry. Seriously, the odd moron can be found everywhere of course, but this is as an open nation (Catalonia) as it can be. Its capital, Barcelona, has over 15% of its residents nationals from over 120 different nationalities. Hardly any case of racism here."
"Thats good to hear, I just know its much worse now because of the coronavirus. More than that though I'm just worried if its even safe to go at this point, or if major sites will be shut down."
"Thanks Anthony. The problem is if something happens during the trip and we end up being held back/quarantined for 2 or 3 weeks, it will be disruptive to our work commitments."
"Med FObviously the threat of being quarantined, anywhere, for any period of time must have consequences for every traveller. Again, I would say that you should monitor the situation carefully and assess it again, to make a positive or negative decision, say, seven to ten days before you are due to travel.I hope that things quieten down over the next month or so and the virus becomes contained and numbers of sufferers fall rather than spiralling.CheersAnthony K"
"Orli F, contrary to what Enric said, there certainly is plenty of racism in Barcelona. Catalans played a major role in Spain’s bloody history of colonialism and slave trading, and the Eixample district is quite literally built with the wealth merchants made from the slave trade in the Americas. The stain of this history can be seen today in the overt racism shown daily to immigrants from Africa and the covert racism in such things as the local habit of calling the bazaar shops “los chinos.” (In New York we used to call the vegetable shops “the Koreans” but everyone realized that was racist over 30 years ago.) Unlike other European cities like Paris or London, you’ll see that the majority of immigrants, including those from the former colonies whose stolen wealth built Barcelona, are forced into menial and low wage jobs. That said, the racism is usually covert so your boyfriend shouldn’t experience anything too obvious.Your bigger problem is probably getting your boyfriend back into the US. The current US government is creating racist and xenophobic policies and will use any excuse to keep out “foreigners.” Coming from a country with a higher number of Coronavirus cases is a good excuse to bar entry. I wouldn’t risk it if I were you."

We are thinking of booking now for early October. The flights are a steal from JFK and it’s our anniversary. I’m wondering if I should book this far in advance.Thanks everyone Deborah from Connecticut
"“Interesting. Border control during a pandemic is racist.Yup, That makes sense“Mike A, yes border control in a not-yet pandemic can in some cases be reasonable, and it can also be used as a racist and xenophobic excuse for keeping out people deemed to be undesirable. Similarly, all border control can be reasonable, but our president’s southern border wall is just racism. Same idea."
"@dma1250.... for f*** sake, you certainly are clueless on what racism is. You've never seem racism as such as I've seen in a number of major cities all over the world I've been lucky enough to live in. You don't get beaten in Barcelona because your skin is of different colour, you don't get turned down in a job because you're ""not from here"" (if your resume matches the needs, of course!), you don't get -in general terms!- harassed by police because you are not white... It really pisses me off these people that go using terms so lightly without having seen what racism in 2020 means."
"Thanks for your reply. I guess we will have to assess the situation day by day. Especially because some countries might ban travel to/from Spain. I wouldn’t want to be separated from my boyfriend at the border. The history of racism (as well as the horrors of the inquisition) in Spain is unfortunate, but as long as there is no overt racist actions/comments it won’t affect our trip directly.Edited: 6:52 pm, March 08, 2020 "

"""I wouldn't have expected the Spanish Inquisition on this post but... here we go.""Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!(c) Monty Python."
"Enric, you seem to have an absurdly limited conception of what racism is. Covert racism is just as dangerous as overt racism, and there is plenty of overt racism in Barcelona. I come from a deeply racist country and I know it when I see it. The worst racists are the ones who don't even realize what they are, which seems to be the case here.

Sempre igual, francament no sé què fas encara en un territori de merda com aquest ple de gent tant dolenta i tant ximple. @Orli FI understand, it's scary getting ""locked out"" of one's home when ill. If anything, know that here in Catalonia, despite recent fallbacks, we still have one of the best healthcare systems in the world -not my saying! (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Spain. So if it comes to worst, you'd be in good hands. Anyhow, as of today, life goes on as usual, no closures, no special measures (other than prevention and treatment) and our health services, as those elsewhere, are in full alert. HOWEVER, one needs to factor in this is a major hub in the south of Europe, far more travellers visit this zone than the Lombardy in Italy so it's very likely there'll be more cases of CoVid-19 in the weeks to come and then there might be different measures in place. Still, everybody is learning from the successes and failures of others (namely China and Italy) and I doubt there'll be any lockdown here as it's proven not to work to stop contagion. There's likely to be instead recommendations and plans to treat patients to recovery. But again... we'll see.Jewish?... don't miss El Call in Barcelona (https:/…muhba-el-call) and, if you can fit a visit to El Call in Girona (https:/…monuments_call.php) you'll be surprised."

We will be in Barcelona at the end of April. I have head a lot about pick pockets. What was your view? Also do they allow backpacks in the Sagrada Familia?
"@Linda G, have you seen the title of this thread...?"
Perhaps it's an observation that pick-pocketing has suddenly become a high-risk 'occupation' because who knows if their marks might be infected with purses and wallets covered in viruses?
"Linda G- to answer your question, no they don't allow backpacks inside, but they do have lockers in which you can store them just inside the entrance to the Basilica."
"LindaG,just cough all the time and noone will be close to you so 0 pickpocket risk."
"Linda prepare to be pickpocketed in Barcelona it's do common even locals treat it like a running joke.. Keep your purse out of sight at all times.Edited: 11:15 am, March 09, 2020 "

"This is the forum for BARCELONA, not Nice, nor Madrid."
"IF either country raises their level from 2 to 3, she will probably find it easier to get out of the country that doesn't."
"Please ignore the post from Shandoz from Dublin who loves posting alarmist words. There are already loads of earlier threads giving sensible advice.

Planning a trip to Barcelona April 1st. Has anyone heard of any major tourist attractions being closed. Are most of the Easter events still going on as planned?
"Right now, everything is normal. All sites are open. (Only today I have read of a first ""closure"" in Barcelona, a daycare centre. But that's not for tourists of course.)And I am not sure what ""Easter events"" you were thinking of, but you will hardly find any of those in Barcelona (even without COVID-19). In any case, there are still no guidelines to cancel events in Barcelona (nor Catalunya in general). The authorities seem to believe that everything is still pretty much under control (again, for now)."

"ColleaguesAlthough my own, annual, visit, is not for another ten weeks, living in a Capital City, with a large diverse population and many visitors, year round, I am closely monitoring the situation through the UK Govt Foreign Office Travel information for Spain and, now and again accessing a few Spanish Health Organisation websites.The situation, in Spain, the Catalan region, Barcelona and around is certainly not as critical as, say, Italy and not even so bad as their neighbour France.Looking at the effects elsewhere, each day, can give us a little idea of what might happen over the next fortnight or month, but no-one knows for sure and no-one can say what actions the Spanish Authorities, or Airlines, might take as the number suffering from the virus increases.Certainly, I will not change my plans at this stage and probably will not make any negative changes until seven or ten days before I am due to travel, unless notified by my chosen Airline or Hotel group that I cannot get to them.Personally, and I stress that, if I were due to travel to the region in the next seven days, I feel that I would certainly do so, depending solely on ease of travel and getting back into the UK, from Spain, when my visit would end.As said this is simply a personal view, from a non-resident who, recently, has taken to making annual trips to both Barcelona and Sitges.In some small way, although I am sad that many are missing out on the delights of Barcelona, if there are less people present when I visit Galleries, Museums and, say, Markets then I will be a little bit pleased by that.As an example, for those of you who know London, I visited the National Gallery, on Monday, and at noon Trafalgar Square was as quiet as The Whispering Gallery in St Pauls Cathedral.I wish everyone well and hope you all enjoy your vacations and/or business trips and stay in rude health.Anthony KPS - Apologies for the length of this post."

There were subsequent clarifications by the administration regarding the U.S.'s European travel ban: (i) the suspension does not apply to U.S. nationals or permanent residents and their families (it is not yet clear if there are additional conditions); (ii) the suspension applies to those who have been in the Schengen Zone within the past 14 days. The press is all over this and will undoubtedly provide clearer details than I can when they are available.
"Has anyone been successful in trying to get refunds for trips to Barcelona?Barcelona FC are refunding my tickets.

I don't want to fork out £ 500 plus on being stuck in a hotel with a closed city, or lose wages from being in self-isolation."
I got a refund from my hotel in Barcelona with no problem. I’ve been in touch with airlines via email but I’m expecting a long wait time for a response. If that doesn’t work I’m sure your credit card company would be willing to help out.

"We, too, just cancelled our trip to Barcelona. Supposed to leave from London just about now. Tried to get in touch with someone from Ryan Air this morning about possibly getting a voucher for a future flight if not a refund. But couldn't get through. They basically don't have a cancellation policy. However, scheduled to fly back with British Air. I have the option of applying for a voucher for a future flight. I've done that and hope that I will get the voucher as I know I'll be able to use it within the next 12 months.Cancelled hotel and have asked for a refund, but no word yet. Again I would be happy if I got credit for a future stay.Cancelled my restaurant reservations. I didn't have to pay anything up front, but of course, as a courtesy wanted to cancel asap. The restuarants all promptly responded very kindly.My husband and I are US citizens living and working in the UK for an American company. With the just announced US travel restrictions and with my husband's company's travel restrictions, we needed to cancel. I'm hoping the hotel, if not Ryan Air, will understand it's really in all of our best intersts to cancel. Like I said, I'd be happy with a credit if I can't get a refund. We'll try to travel in the near future to Barcelona. I'll stay in a different hotel if I don't even hear from the one I just had to cancel. And Ryan Air....I'm happy to have an excuse not to fly with them!"
"I will travel if they won't refund me. If they don't care about the virus why should I? I'm fit and healthy, their staff might be vulnerable but they would protect them if they were concerned for them by following the advice of travelling only if necessary. I don't consider my trip necessary and think it's pointless now, but I'll find things to do I might get an extra 14 days in the hotel or a massive medical bill to give to my insurer, all far more costly than a refund. Ryanair & Vueling or my Hotel will not get a penny of me again."

EnricM Just because you've self isolated for the majority of your life and do not spend much time communicating outside internet forums The rest of the world some have lives to liveIf your city is still allowing flights in with those on it not just repatriating then they are responsible for allowing it to spread. If they had done something earlier like stopping all flights into Barcelona and repatriated its citizens at it's own cost . Then flights and hotels could be refunded by insurance or refunds. Your country hasn't told the WHO or FCO that travelling there shouldn't be done. I've paid more £800 for a trip I don't want. I'm not getting that back am I? Blame your country for considering it ok to still go there.
"Anthony K:Who do you think is think of protecting their pockets more?Ryanair, Vueling, the Hotel, insurance companies or the Spanish authorities?I don't want to go but until the above do the right thing then I am out of pocket if I don't travel. You realise its there decision that is needed for the WHO & FCO to bring restrictions in to make the Airlines cancel flights. Only then can I get a refund.It looks like they want to protect the interests of big business first, then worry about the implications of allowing masses of people in from anywhere.  Staying put indoors all day might come easy for those who's life revolves around Internet forums. I want to get my money back to do something else later in the year. Barcelona and Spain will be at the bottom of my list unless they stop being so stupid and act now. Those profiteering and being greedy will be remembered.

Public gatherings are banned, most shops other than those selling food or other essential items such as pharmacies will be closed, many businesses and all schools and universities are closed, and all citizens have been instructed to remain at home except when going about a limited set of activities in particular to buy food or other essential items, to return home to their primary residence, to go to hospital or other health centres, to go to work (if unable to work from home), to carry out caring or similar duties or in case of real need.UK nationals currently in Spain should follow the advice of local authorities. Anybody planning to travel to Spain should consult their airline or tour operator.The rules on travel to EU countries will stay the same until 31 December 2020. This page will be updated with country-specific information for travellers to Spain as things change. Sign up for email alerts and view the latest updates for UK nationals travelling to and living in Europe.Let's hope things improve soon for everyone."
"The UK Govt is advising that no-one should travel to Spain unless that is essential travel ... eg - getting home.1) Might you regard a vacation as essential travel and thus can you get there relatively easily...2) Are any of the major attractions remaining open, even though everything else is closing ... Restaurants, Cafes, Bars etc.3) If you travel to Spain, now or anytime soon, will you have to self-iisolate when you arrive home, even if you do not have any Flu-like symptoms.4) Will the UK Govt Advice plus the action taken by Spanish Authorities improve the situation for those needing refunds...This morning, I hear, that as from Tuesday EasyJet will be stopping all flights to and from Spain.Keep wellAnthonyEdited: 3:17 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Following with interest ...My family and I were/are planning a short break in Barcelona April 4th to April 7th.As of this morning I was able to cancel my AirBnB in full due to 'extenuating circumstances' based on the FCO change in status.As far as my direct booked BA flights go - I've heard nothing in terms of refunds disappointingly. Seems like the FCO 'avoid all but essential travel' clause does not qualify for FULL refunds from BA. Kind of crazy as with Spain in a state of emergency coupled with instructions to stay indoors means this would not meet my requirements of a 'family holiday'I'm going to play the waiting game with BA in the hope they will actually cancel my flights and failing that will have to resort to using travel insurance to get my refund. I might actually ring Amex first as I booked using an American Express card.Good luck allEdited: 9:52 am, March 15, 2020 "
"BA cancellations are almost inevitable, Otherwise you might see Cabin Crew and others refusing to staff flights.Anthony K"
"TygerBright, BA doesn’t know or necessarily care about the purpose of your travel. So the fact that Spain doesn’t currently meet your “requirements of a 'family holiday'” is irrelevant. Lots of Spaniards and Catalans living and studying in the UK are flying home, and lots of UK residents living here are doing the same. Hopefully no one is selfish enough to take a family holiday anywhere right now, at home or abroad, as we are all possibly infected and spreading the virus everywhere we go.If anyone has to fly to Spain I suggest using Vueling or another local carrier."
"Following this thread with a lot of interest. Unfortunately, I had to cancel our trip to Barcelona end of this month (and a trip to Seville, in the beginning of April). Lucky for me, our airlines KLM and Transavia eased their policies in regard to rebooking or cancellation. KLM offers vouchers if you want to postpone your trip. Transavia offers you to rebook to the same destination, until end of Oktober. Seville is rebooked for this fall. Barcelona cancelled as a whole Lucky for us, we had where there in March too.Almost but not least, I would like to wish the people in Spain all the best and strength with this terrible crisis.And finally, for unbiased and up to date reporting on the Covid19 situation in Spain, follow Matthew Bennett on Twitter.We'll be back in Spain in June, hopefully things will be better then."
"Can't edit my typo's any more, sorry for that!"
"Irish TV is advising all Irish in Spain to make it back here by Thursday or there maybe complicated difficulties getting back, reading between the lines borders in all of Spain close all ways later this week.. Just speculating"
"Personal note ... I have e-mailed my chosen Hotel in Sitges, regarding my May 19th to 26th booking, and expect an answer today...British Airways appear not to have cancelled, as yet, and are not inviting people to contact them unless you are due to travel in the next 72 hours,I doubt that I will be able to take this vacation, on my desired dates, and a delay until June may not see circumstances improving.On a more positive note my Insurance does have a clause that covers ""cancellations"" and it would, I believe, pay me if either my Hotel or Airline does not.I wish everyone well and if you are having to self-isolate, because there is nowhere to go, I hope you are getting deliveries of essential medication, food and drinks.CheersAnthony KPS - My desire is to be as positive as possible at the present time."
"Athony, you have a booking for the end of May. Don't you think that it makes more sense to wait and see what happens? I am sure that anyone working in the travel industry already has their hands full handling requests from clients who were planning to travel this week or the next few weeks.Anyway, nobody can say now what the situation will be in 1+ month from now...Edited: 2:10 am, March 16, 2020 "
"If we take effective precautions and isolate ourselves at home, we can effectively reduce the rate of transmission"
"kbbcn re Post 210Please refrain from being so aggressively suggestive. I may post as I wish, to all, who may be in a similar position.Get my Posts removed, if the inclination or the desire takes you, my friend.Keep wellAnthony"
"Anthony, I am not (knowingly) aggresive. Just saying that maybe you should wait and see for a while. (I have lots of open flight and hotel reservation for the next few weeks, and I can see that for anything more than a few days out there is no use in pursuing any reaction from the companies involved. But once you get closer to the travel date, rebookings / refunds etc. become available.) And I have no intention to have your posts removed, don't worry :-) (Although, technically, double posting is not allowed...)"
"kbbcnPerhaps, wrongly, I interpreted your earlier message, on the Sitges board, as aggressive, and had that one removed.I have left your pointed point of view, here, as it should be seen. I completely understand your viewpoint, but my actions may make others aware of what they can expect and what options are open.I can only speak as I know, I feel and from experience, unless I put something in quotes...I do not wish to fall out with you, for any reasonAnthony K"
"I have family booked and paid to travel out to me for Easter, but no point in doing anything, or worrying yet. IMO x"
"I don’t mean to be aggressive or negative here, but vacation planning seems inappropriate for all. The UK appears to be on the same curve as Spain (the number of confirmed cases has more than doubled in 3 days and the government has announced upcoming quarantines for everyone over 70 or with health conditions), and so is the US (the number of cases doubled in 3 days as well). The caseload in Italy is continuing to increase daily despite the nationwide lockdown, so I see no reason to expect a miraculous turnaround here in Spain. I hope I’m proven to be overly negative. I think we should all focus on staying home and limiting our exposure and our chance of infecting others."
"dma1250Some of us secured our 2020 vacations and further entertainment, in 2019.The watchword might now be caution, but I've got a lot of money tied up in entertainment futures, or is that future entertainment.CheersAnthonyEdited: 7:26 am, March 16, 2020 "
"I completely understand where you are coming from Anthony K.It would be a lot easier if either the British government or the Spanish government stated. No travel to Spain.Then flight operators can refund. At the moment it is all wishy washy.My flights for the weekend cannot yet be cancelled, although Ryanair will now allow change of dates."
I wish you the best and speediest of resolutions.CheersAnthony
"Re Post 209 - My chosen Hotel in Sitges says ...""Dear Mr. Kreppel,The hotel is closed until March 30, but these dates may change as the situation evolves. In principle for the day of arrival, May 19, it should be open, but in case it is not open, we will make the return.Kind regardsManel LeónDpto. Reservas""Anthony K"
"As I said earlier, I cancelled my hotel booking, which was refundable, for 23-27 March and I have finally had an email from EqsyJet saying that flights to and from Barcelona have been cancelled and that I can re-book for somewhere else or later in the year or get a refund.Obviously very disappointed that it has come to this, but it has, this has been the best possible outcome. Hope that things get back to normal sooner rather than later."

"Very sad to see that a time when people desperately need to be kind and gentle to each other, there are people engaging in character assassination. This is the reality today in the province:Cataluña es una de las comunidades con mayor número de contagios confirmados: 1.866 personas. Además, se han registrado 41 muertes.Why on earth pick this time when we are all under lockdown and experiencing real hardships to start picking on people especially if you are not even here in Spain? Please give it a rest. If you feel the need to post and would like to help, maybe send a message of support to all the people of the city of Barcelona, province and country as a whole. Spain now has the fourth highest contagion rate in the world. Stay safe and well."
"I completely agree with qualityspy1, everyone needs to get over themselves. Now is the time to support each other, not to squabble. Just to clarify: Spain has the fourth largest number of cases worldwide. In terms of “contagion rate” it is actually 12th worldwide. In Europe it is 7th (8th if you include Vatican City). https:/…countries"
"i have just read that thinks are turning bad for the Asian community in the US (that the US president keeps calling the virus as the ""Chinese virus"" might not help).hope that the OP had time to buy some more ""I’m not from China but actually am American"" tshirts and stay safe from the attacks at home."
"A personal decision ...It is fairly nailed-on that I will lose my mid-May holiday to Sitges/Barcelona and, very possibly, my September vacation to Paris ... an Egyptian trip, this year, has not been determined.However, when Europe opens up, again, to globetrotters, I have decided that Sitges/Barcelona will be my first choice.Love you all, there, wish you all rude health ...Anthony K"

"@staffs...: Sadly, corporate greed knows no bounds. Have you checked prices on hotels.com or other booking sites? They may have jacked up the prices hoping that they can capture some impulse buying. Give it a few weeks and things may have settled down."
"Let's wheel back a little bit in time. The Mobile World Congress due to be hosted in Barcelona was only cancelled because of high-profile corporate cancellations, not because the Ajuntament (City Council) considered it was the right thing to do. At that time the virus was still considered an external threat — something out there — when in fact there were already numerous cases of local transmission.And, the City Council's response? Join with hoteliers and restrauteurs to launch a promotional campaign — Now is the best time to visit Barcelona — aimed at encouraging bargain seekers to take advantage of heavily discounted hotel room rates. What?Completely the exact wrong thing to do — like throwing fuel onto a smouldering fire. Invite lots of people from lots of countries to come here and help shore up their losses.If it wasn't deemed safe to visit Barcelona for company expenses fuelled executives how come it was considered safe to visit Barcelona for ordinary travellers?The Ajuntament, and the hotel and restaurant gremis (trade associations) have blood on their hands."
"Catalonia's Health Minister declares that Catalunya is is prepared to detect and treat the novel coronavirus https://govern.cat/salapremsa/notes-premsa/3…The most telling comment in this melange of disinformation, falsehoods and wishful thinking is from Dr, Antoni Trilla."
"Re Post 232 ... ""Let's wheel back a little bit in time.""Let's not. Otherwise all we do is attack our complacent Governments for not adhering to the situation by saying ...""We will soon be an Italy and we must lockdown now."" Some countries have acted too slowly.Look forward and contact, as and when they will talk to you, all those that you have bookings with until, I suggest, the end of July.Personally, everyone that I need to liaise with are contacting me and giving refunds ... my Spanish Hotel has offered a refund for mid to late May, if they are still closed ... British Airways, are the notable exception, and they will not talk to me until 72 hours before I am due to fly. Anthony K"
"""Otherwise all we do is attack our complacent Governments for not adhering to the situation…˝ Precisely. It's called holding to them to account. It's a necessary part of the democratic process."
"It's an unnecessary part of TripAdvisor, my friend.I badger the UK Government and liaise with many on Twitter ...That is my sociable media of choice ... OK?Anthony K"
So how did that turn out?
"Hello All from US - South Florida. I was supposed to be visiting Barcelona this week for my 50th Birthday. We have re-booked our trip for September. We were not getting any refunds, so a change was in order and we hope to visit then. I've been waiting since I was 16 to visit Barcelona. OH! I believe I will enjoy it all the more when I finally arrive! It's very hot here in South Florida in the meantime and thankful to be enjoying our pool in between sewing masks. Best Wishes!"

"ColleaguesMy feeling is that most of the people who visit these Forums, apart from residents of the City, are those who are looking to visit from outside of Spain.European Governments are acting differently with regard to easing some restrictions, and, at present, any easing might only be with regard to internal travel and the reopening of some retail units and Schools.The most significant events, for many of us, will be the re-opening of borders, allowing Flights and Rail travel, for tourists, rather than, only, for those who must get home.The dates for the re-opening of many borders is, now, only something we might guess at and Governments must be aware of not taking these measures too soon and inviting a second-wave of the virus.Even after borders re-open things like ""social distancing"" may remain in place. That could affect numbers of passengers in an aircraft cabin, rail carriage and even on coaches. Finally, it could also affect the numbers allowed into attractions, such as Museums, Galleries, Theatres, Cinemas, Concert Halls, Clubs and the numbers allowed into Cafes, Restaurants and Bars.Let us all hope that when things return to some semblance of normality that we have the opportunity, for the first time or once again, to enjoy the delights of Barcelona and other Spanish Cities, Towns and villages. Keep well allAnthony K"
