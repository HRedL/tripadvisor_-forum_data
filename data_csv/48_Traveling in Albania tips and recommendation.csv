"Hi, We are planning to travel to Tirana, Durres and Berat i would like to know is it better to rent a car or hire a driver to drive us from Tirana to Berat? Also is there option to make a day trip from Tirana to Durres. Unfortunately i don't find enough information about costs.Thank you for your answers."
"Salem, from Tirana to Durres isn't far, only may be 35 km. But take a small hotel in Tirana, than a public bus to durres and there also a small hotel - everything is affordable.-Or, if you prefer, rent a car, but without a driver. For what do you need a driver? Safe the money and drive on your own.Good luck wishes Tony SEdited: 1:48 pm, June 03, 2020 "
At the moment renting a car or hiring a driver are the only options as the public transport is still not allowed.
can you please tell me when the borders open as I would like to drive from Saranda to Montenegro
"Albania has opened land borders from the 1st of this month.Edited: 12:09 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Hey, maybe you guys know any info regarding when the public transportation will be allowed?We're planning to go at the end of July. Thanks"
If the recent spike in infections does not drop there will be none.
"Hello. Depends in which dates will you be in Tirana. I want to inform you that from 1 of July everything will be like before, mena transport , hotels, apartment, etc. For sure in this situation with covid 19, needs to be safe by your own as need to have mask in public and to wash your hands many and many times, for your and others health. You can ask everything you need and want about albania, i can help you and i can share all information to have a great trip and days in albania. If you drive, will be much better to rent a car and you can go everywhere when the spots are and you will enjoy every step. Regards"
Please monitor COVID-19 situation. All neighbours are closing their borders. There is serious COVID-19 spike in almost all Balkan countries. Opening public transport will not help
"People are understanding more and more that Covid cases are a fraud.The last 3 Albanians that supposedly died because of Covid had like 4 other diseases.All people are having a normal life, just with more security measures.Pack immunity will be probably achieved by the end of summer."
When an already ill person gets hit by a car and dies what is the cause of death? How long could have lived without the accident?Do you want to play with fire by neglecting the situation? Check south America situation: winter and people/government neglecting
You can't compare Covid with a car. Covid is a normal virus. People that have died had like 5 illnesses. Sometimes Covid did not evan affect them but still Covid was to blamed.Anyway I am for respecting social distancing.
Covid-19 came from 5G frequencies and They want to control us through specific vaccine.
Has the railway operated this year or are there any plans for it to restart?? many thanks Tony
"As far as i know, passenger trains are not operating."
