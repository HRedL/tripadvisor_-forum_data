"""Europe: All countries except Italy, Sweden, Denmark and Armenia"" I live in Sweden and we can do the PCR test for free here before leaving for traveling. My concern is, why is Sweden listed in the ""expect"" category? Does it mean that our PCR test is not valid?"
"Alright I understand.So I need to do another one when I arrive and will get the result in 24 hours? My concern was that I was going to do one upon arrival and then be isolated for 72 hours and then do it again. That's why I was wondering about why Sweden was in the ""expect"" category."
"Thank you for the clarification. I've not booked yet, have seen that Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines operate from Stockholm. MEA only operates in Norway and Denmark. I'm planing to travel after July 20, so I can wait another week before booking. Gonna wait and see how everything is gonna work when the open up next week.Edited: 3:38 pm, June 26, 2020 "
The main problem will be to find an insurance policy covering all costs of Covid-19 treatment.
