"Anyone able to confirm this?Ken Loyd posted that the swap meet is open today, but it is the last day, until ???It was on his Facebook page. He is asking people to shop on line. Not all the vendors have that ability though. Maui Swap Meet Facebook page only mentions that they are open today. Nothing about the fact that they are closing."
It's probably true. Many people are finally starting to pay attention to the threat COVID-19 poses.
I was there and saw signs saying today was the last day until further notice due to Covid-19.
"Thanks GoPlaces, for confirming that. I'm glad I got my rubs and dressings when I did!"
