"INAH, the federal agency in charge of Chichen Itza, announced yesterday that because of the COVID-19 pandemic Chichen Itza would be closed for the equinox and after that, quien sabe (who knows)?""The Chichen Itzá Archaeological Zone in Yucatan will be closed from March 21 until further notice,"" according to an official statement from INAH.Over the weekend, the governor of Yucatan announced the state was closing Chichen Itza during the equinox, but starting the day before the date announced by the federal government. It also said Chichen would reopen on March 23. The federal government's announcement, however, contradicts that. Chichen Itza will remain closed.In the INAH statement, Chichen Itza is the ONLY site in all Mexico to remain closed. https://www.inah.gob.mx/comunicados/9006"
Is it open now? Any update?

"If you have Twitter, follow Yucatan Tourism and they will announce any openings. https://twitter.com/YucatanTurismo…"
"Media report about the loss of revenue due to the closure of archaeological zones...https:/…So far, no date has been given for the reopening of the zones. According to INAH, they will open when the epidemiological risk colour changes to Green."
"How very odd. I've seen this reported in the press several times, that INAH will reopen sites when the coronavirus status reaches ""verde/green."" Never a link to an INAH statement.According to INAH's official reopening plan (published June 16 and still front and center on its website https://www.inah.gob.mx/ ), museos and archaeological sites will reopen when the stage hits yellow (but it will be gradual). For Chichen Itza, when it reopens the INAH protocols will limit the number of tourists to 1000 per day. Plan or no, when it comes to Chichen Itza, there are a lot of moving parts that certainly could delay the reopening to green. Staff at Chichen Itza have indicated that the site can't reopen because a 75 percent cut to the INAH budget makes it impossible for remaining staff to insure COVID protocols are in place. However, the other factor is the State of Yucatan, which makes hundreds of millions of pesos from Chichen Itza ticket sales. I suspect they want to open the site sooner rather than later. And a final wild card is the 1000+ vendors who flood the site each day to sell trinkets to tourists. Who is going manage them or control for virus?"
"As always, appreciate the comments from the expert on the topic. I have never ssen a link to an INAH statement. Only varioous sources claiming to quote them."
"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Robert. Chichen, though, is so complex, that I can miss stuff. So I appreciate when folks like MisterB266 post links to information, any information, about when it will reopen. Sometimes the official statement by INAH will lag behind the news reporting, usually for political reasons. So all info is good to share. We all just want visitors to get the most up-to-date info possible."
"Very true, EJ. I have seen the official statement lag a bit. Suppose we will know when it happens."
EJ Albright announced on Twitter reopening for september. 'Mexico officials are stating the #ChichenItza and other archaeological zones will begin reopening in September. All have been closed since March due to the Covid19 pandemic.Yucatan Covid19 status has moved from RED to ORANGE.'
"Happy to hear some progress being made. And appreciate the real expert , EJ, keeping us advised of the latest word. Better then relying on soursces such as tour operators . Much appreciated."

"(You may see a post of mine above. After I posted it, I got an inkling I might be wrong. I looked it up and I was, so I've asked it to be deleted. If it's still there, ignore it.)Hey, somebody follows me on TWITTER! Thanks!My Twitter account reports the Chichen Itza news. I was reporting on what is being said, but does that mean Chichen Itza will open in September? The link goes to a statement from the Mexican Secretary of Culture. However INAH, the federal archaeology agency that manages Chichen Itza, still remains mum and on its website is still the plan that Chichen Itza will not reopen until Yucatan state's Covid status is ""yellow."" It is currently ""orange.""Someone, possibly SeanC, cited a report several weeks ago that gave the reopen date for Chichen Itza as Sept. 7. That's exactly the date mentioned in the current news reports, albeit with no direct attribution.Can we assume a statement about reopening that was made by the Secretary of Culture should be taken as gospel? If it is correct, it means that the will of the Secretariat is being imposed on the lower agency which has traditionally been independent. If Chichen Itza opens Sept. 7 and Yucatan is NOT in ""yellow"" state, it's a whole new ball game for how archaeological heritage is handled in Mexico."
Thanks for the update. Hoping Sept 7 is a good date. Maybe someone knows when the Yucatan is going to Yellow. That would be really great news.
"So today, Friday, Aug. 28, there were no fewer than five different news articles about Chichen Itza and none of them had a firm reopening date. They represent a huge game of telephone, just like we used to play as kids, where everyone is in a circle, one person whispers a phrase to the next person and it is passed around until it comes back to the original person--all jumbled.To summarize: Tourism organizations say they have been negotiating with the state of Yucatan and will sign an agreement today about reopening Chichen.State officials have said nothing about an agreement, but the head of CULTUR, the agency that collects tickets at Chichen, said it will reopen Chichen whenever INAH, the federal agency in charge, says so.INAH has said nothing since June, when it released a reopening plan. Chichen can reopen when Yucatan reaches YELLOW Covid status (it is ORANGE) and even then, tourists will be limited to 1,000 per day versus the normal 8,000.The federal Secretary of Culture, as reported before, said archaeological sites will begin to reopen Sept. 7. While INAH is under their purview, they have usually been independent, but not always. The concerts held at Chichen a decade ago were approved by INAH's bosses--at that time the Secretary of Public Education--not INAH.TL;DR No one knows when Chichen will open or if they do, they ain't saying."
