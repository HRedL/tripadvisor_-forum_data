Ever thought of buying some beard clippers and doing it yourself?
"This is interesting since I'm closing in on 50 and never had one. It's my covid thing at the moment. Itchy. Waited to long it's more grey then normal. Want to trim it and know where but I'm thinking buying the clippers my self. Maybe get all drunk and take the spacers out and go bald. Never tried that either. Scared I may have a peanut head or something along that line.  I get a straight edge shave once a month for fun. Its 90 baht but I'm in Bangkok. Normally shave myself every 3 days. The blade is for fun since my son is forced to cut his hair every 30 days, waiting time shave.  So after my boring story many places in Phuket could do it. If u cant get that translated and u live there I dont know what to say, go Grizzly Adam's. I would expect Phuket to charge 150 to 200 for that easy job. Get the trimmers."
"Aren't you worried about Covid-19 at all? Getting a shave or a beard trim by somebody else at this time is only asking for trouble.Edited: 2:56 pm, June 28, 2020 "
Heard Phuket got hit hardest. Was in Sukhumvit shopping at Villa Market at went to Japanese restaurant cause wifey wanted some hot soup. Same parking lot restaurant packed. Was tripping seeing a bar packed crazy. As we left had a bar I've heard of on here packed.That one was named Robinhood. Pretty much going back to normal too fast. Both kids different schools want to re open this Wednesday. Its moving fast. Not sure on Phuket but we probably do a south run on the first. So many friends posting FB all over Thailand. Great deals at the moment.

Any barber that is open. However you may need to use sign language to indicate what you want or depending on beard a picture. I have to agree with Chris however and suggest that next time you are in the UK you invest in a beard trimmer they are only about Â£20 for a decent one
