"No new casesNo hospitalizationsCapacity to treat covid patients has expandedNo new booking until May 15th at the earliest, possibly June 1st. They want to be able to test every person landing at the airport before they reopen bookings. I got the impression that June 1st would be the latest, but I could be wrong.State of emergency will be extended to June 12th, needs to be passed by legislatureCould they really test everyone coming through the airport?? They can’t even test people right now who might have it! Blood tests? Nasal swab? Sounds like a pretty big delay. But a great idea if it’s feasible."

Correct Rick
"They have tests, but just like many places in States, they need swabs.Last I heard they were doing voluntary temperature screening at the airport.Edited: 5:44 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"""They have tests, but just like many places in States, they need swabs."" Well that's a fat lot of good."
They won't be out of swabs forever.
"I wonder if they misspoke when they say they want to ""test"" every arriving passenger. Perhaps they meant ""screen"" for temperature and symptoms? Either that, or they are talking without really understanding the implications of what they are saying.The reason I ask is that when you do the math on actually testing every arriving passenger the utter impossibility -- or at least insurmountable impracticality -- of the task quickly becomes apparent. Even with the availability of the ""rapid"" test from Abbott Labs.According to the Abbott press release, their new COVID 19 rapid test platform can reduce time to results ""to as little as 5 minutes for positive results and 13 minutes for negative results.""So you're really looking at a test that is ""as short as 13 minutes"" to find out whether the person tested is actually negative... which is what you're looking for. (So the five-minute test time is meaningless unless you're assuming everyone on the plane is infected.)Just to make the math easy, let's add a minute up front for sample collection, thirteen minutes for each test, and a minute to clean the machine to prep for the next test. And keep in mind that the machine can only process ONE TEST at a time.Let's assume that a typical commercial flight into St Thomas or St Croix holds 200 passengers.If every arrival gate at each USVI airport has a machine, at 15 minutes per passenger, we're looking at 3,000 minutes to screen every passenger deplaning a single commercial flight.Yes... that's 50 HOURS of testing time to deplane a SINGLE flight.Crazy, right? OK...Let's assume there are TWO machines at each gate. Only 25 hours to screen everyone.Four machines? Still gonna take 12 and a half hours to deplane a single flight. 8 machines? Now we're down to just over six hours of screening time to deplane just ONE flight. Let's go crazy and assume there are SIXTEEN machines at every gate.. We're now down to adding ONLY three hours of screening time to deplane a single flight. Wanna get that down to an hour and half of screening for a single flight? You'll need THIRTY TWO machines. At every gate.Consider what that means for STT airport: according to Wikipedia STT sees 1,4 Million passenger arrivals a yea, which is ~3,900 a day passenger a day. That'd mean 58,000 extra minutes a day, every day, to test every passenger. That's roughly 975 HOURS of testing time a day. If you were willing to accept an additional 2hrs net screening time to clear every inbound flight St Thomas airport, that volume of passengers would require 487 testing machines running 24hrs a day. But since flights into STT aren't spread evenly throughout the 24hr day, you'd actually need more like 700-800 screening machines running between say 8am and 10pm. (Knowing that during peak hours, the screening lines might bulge to 4-5hrs.) Plus... where will St Thomas find the 700-1,000 trained/qualified healthcare workers to collect the samples, process the tests, etc?Sure when you say ""test every person landing"" that sounds simple enough.But when you look at the details and do the math involved, you realize that this is an entirely impractical idea.Edited: 6:25 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"I work in healthcare in Mass and you can’t get a test unless you are symptomatic and the rapid point of care testing is only for healthcare workers and first responders right now. Also the testing has only a 75% accuracy rate, that’s all testing be, it rapid or not, which is not reassuring. I also don’t get the checking people’s temp thing to screen as by the time you have a temp you have already been contagious for the last 12 days with the most shedding of the virus on days 13 and 14 then symptoms appear."
I'm sure he meant to say taking temperatures of incoming passengers and not testing - at least that is what has been said in the past.
So what happens if 195 passengers on that plane test negative and 5 passengers test positive ? Then what ?
"PIa- I was assuming the same thing except he said test a couple times and said that it may take til June 1st to have the testing in place. I would think they have the resources right now to take temperatures? Maybe need more people if there’s going to more/full planes. And taking temperatures isn’t going to protect us, I think a huge majority have no symptoms based on the antibody tests. IMO..."
"Testing of temperature, not Covid-19 testing."
newsofstjohn.com/todays-governors-briefing-s…That doesn’t sound like temperature testing. She took it the same way I did that there would be some kind of covid testing. Thoughts?
According to this article screening may include Covid-19 testing. The private labs are advertising that they offer tests to travelers who qualify. https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…
"The Consortium article is from April 2 and was clearly about temperature testing. The Governor's latest address notes that ""the goal"" is to ""test"" everybody coming into the territory and that, ""If they are unable to test every single visitor, the Governor stated they would definitely test those displaying any symptoms related to COVID-19."""
"We have a site here in R.I. that does the rapid testing. It’s through CVS and done at drive through at local casino. Multiple tents set up, lines coned off. You make an appointment online and then told what time to show up. You don’t get out of your car. You drive up as directed being told to keep your windows closed then once it’s your turn you roll down your window, are swabbed and in 15 minutes have results. Now after this has been In place for a few weeks we are hearing this rapid test isn’t 100%. Some have had false positives. So there’s no foolproof or easy answer. When this all ramped up the local airports here were doing temperature screenings. Even that proves nothing. You could be carrying the virus and not have a temperature."
"The Governor talked about waiting to open up the territory for visitors until a 15-minute test was available to screen all visitors.Cheers, RickG"
"""The Governor talked about waiting to open up the territory for visitors until a 15-minute test was available to screen all visitors.""Which takes us right back to Post #6 to demonstrate the logistical impossibility.There is indeed no easy answer."

"Let's say there *IS* testing - although someone already did the math on this thread and showed us that's not very realistic. But let's say they *ARE* able to test every passenger arriving. What happens if they get a positive? Do they round up every person who was on the plane with that infected person and send them home? After all, prolonged exposure to an infected person how you catch it. One person infected on a plane can infect the entire plane. Then what? Same question with fever. What if someone gets off the plane with a fever? Does everyone who was on the plane with them get sent back?Edited: 2:21 pm, April 23, 2020 "
test before you load the airplane?
That all just sounds like chaos to me and they still don't have enough tests to test the sick people.
Get tested by your private physician the day before you fly. Bring the doctors note showing negative results (make it standardized by TSA) with you to show TSA Agents at the airport. Carry the doctors note with you at all times.
"<< ""test before you load the airplane?"" >>So it'll now take 6-12-25-50hrs to BOARD the flight rather than to DEPLANE it?:-)Doesn't matter where or when you do the testing, there's just no way around the capacity issue."
"Testing capabilities are improving thanks to researchers in NJ and around the world, so there may soon be a quick and effective way to screen people rapidly.https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/s…"
"More from Governor Bryan today. 1 active case with no hospitalizations in the Territory with 50 cases recovered. 31 public beaches had water tests come back as healthy; St. John beaches Cruz Bay, Oppenheimer, Great Cruz Bay, and Frank Bay were tested - https:/…More news on Monday on the phased re-opening the economy.Watch yourself at https://www.facebook.com/GovernmentHouseUSVI/Cheers, RickGEdited: 1:49 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Why would they only test the water at the 4 least ""swimmable"" beaches on STJ? Cruz Bay, Frank Bay, Great Cruz Bay and Oppenheimer?? Why not Maho and Trunk where most swimmers are?"
"SusanFarley I'm guessing bc Cruz Bay beach, Frank GCB and OPP are USVI beaches and the other North shore beaches are National Park beaches ..."
"<<"" there may soon be a quick and effective way to screen people rapidly."" >>According to the linked article the new test would ""have the capacity to deliver results... within 24 or 48 hours."" Doesn't sound terribly ""quick"" to me. Certainly not in the context of travelers boarding/deplaning an aircraft."
"I have to agree with RJP. about testing passengers at the airports. My brother in law is a Dr. at a large NYC hospital treating COVID-19 patients. He developed symptoms about 10 days ago - loss of appetite, fever and immediately self-quarantined. He was tested as soon as symptoms appeared and it took 6 days for results to come back. He was positive and is at home waiting for his symptoms to subside and then he will have to stay quarantined for an additional 14 days. From a practicality standpoint, even if tests are developed that are quicker, I imagine it will still be very difficult to test each and every person getting on or off a plane, unless results are instantaneous and not taking 13 minutes or in my B-I-L's case, 6 days for results."
