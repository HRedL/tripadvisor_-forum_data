"Hi, my son is looking to join his girlfriend in Brazil mid Sept for 10 days. She's a native and will be there the week prior staying with family. Upon his arrival they will stay an additional 2 days with her family and fly to Fernando de Noronha island. Then come back and stay in SP before returning to the US. I'm wondering how safe it is. They're both 24 and in excellent health, but still. Any advice would be great. Of course they just can't seem to wait until next year :)"
"Marina,Given the current situation, he is not going to have any problem to get in the country. Noronha would be opened for tourism by that date. But you have to consider that many things could suddenly change. Also at some touristic destinations most attractions are not yet fully opened, so they might not enjoy the same experience as in normal times. Cheers!"
"The risks of Covid infection remain present in all parts of the world. I am in Brazil and can confirm that the overwhelming majority of us here remain alive and well. Assuming he is in full command of his mental faculties, you might consider declining to mention to your son of 24 years that you asked this question on the TA forum.Edited: 10:17 am, August 12, 2020 "
"Why is that? Just because he's 24 doesn't mean he's no longer my son. It actually makes it that much harder because he still is my son, but I have absolutely no control of what he does. I asked the question because I'm not there. So I wanted to get experience of people that were. The media tends to dramatize things, when they're actually not so. For example we live in TX. According to the media, people are dying everywhere from Covid, but it's absolutely not like that. Most of the restaurants are open and most people are living normal lives. So I wanted to see what local people were saying about Brazil, because the US has it at a level 4 for travel advisory."
"Thank you. As a mom that makes me feel better! :)Edited: 3:31 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"reading your last line, it seems to be Sept 2021... it should be a nice trip then.by then, regular passenger air service to Fernando de Noronha (FEN) should be re-established... at the moment, there are no passenger flights available for tourists.... only FEN residents and certain essential workers can enter the island now... no date has been set for FEN re-opening to tourists.in ""normal times"", one flies to FEN by first connecting at Recife (REC) airport,,, or, on certain days of the week, also Natal (NAT)... using Gol or Azul.... too early to tell what schedules will be for Sept, 2021.there is a specific forum for FEN, with topics listing the extra fees one must pay to enter FEN and to access the Natl Park there (different for Brazilians and non-Brazilians)... they should add those costs to the budget for a FEN trip:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g61632…FEN, as an isolated island with a small resident population, was one of the very few places in Brazil that had a real lockdown and could really enforce it... it is now slowly re-opening for local residents... e.g. this Saturday (Aug. 8), one of the beaches (Sueste) inside Natl Pk finally re-opened for FEN residents.... the whole Natl Pak had been closed even for FEN residents since mid-March.as far as SP, the girlfriend and family (are they SP residents?) should be able to give all the tips they need. and plenty of tips on what to do in SP in 48 hours in its specific forum... one can leave additional questions there if any:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g30363…[the only advice I would give is to NOT spend any money now with lodging at FEN; as certain places may not survive the economic impacts of covid19; plenty of time to do that before Sept 2021]"
Check this recent thread for health insurance and other considerations. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29428…Brazil is one of just a couple of countries (if not the worst in the world) that have done even worse than the US in controlling the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has so many cases of COVID-19 it probably figures what's a few more cases coming in with international travelers. There are a number of threads you can look at about crime in Sao Paulo and Brazil.
"Hi, I really appreciate everyone's advice. Unfortunately it is a trip for 2020, like in one moth."
"well,, I would really think again about going to FEN in September 2020.as you mentioned ""girlfriend relatives in Brazil"", I would have them call directly lodgings in FEN to see if they have any color about when FEN will allow tourists again... and I would call more than one to get a real sense of what is going on (and not just a sales pitch and wishful thinking about when FEN will re-open to tourists...)in the interim, I would not buy any plane tkts to FEN... and start thinking of other destinations in Brazil to spend time...a good guide (for those worried about covid19) is using tips in this local travel blog (in Portuguese; either google translate or have native speakers read it).... it has been compiling data on 100 tourist destinations in Brazil... updated weekly....https:/…then, if it is a beach destination, I would also cross reference it to rainfall data for Sept... no fun going to a beach place if it is the rainy season (fortunately, Sept is usually not a particularly rainy month in most Brazilian beaches):https:/…then there is the issue of domestic flights... ramping up but still far below pre-covid19 levels. meaning it takes some more advance planning to get from A to B, especially if they are not major cities - many flights are still not back to daily schedules:https:/…107514897"
"Okay, so I accept that you care about your adult son and will pack him some sandwiches and make sure his ears are clean before he leaves. Point noted. As regards asking people who are actually here in Brazil for advice, the TA forum is just about your worst option. Very few regular contributors actually live here as can be seen from the responses above. Most of the more prolific contributors are in the USA and like to trawl the internet for news about Brazil. They habitually link wildly inaccurate and sensational reports churned out merely for news providers to generate income. Rokatoo gives good counsel so read what he has stated. My own advice would be to visit Brazil for reasons of necessity and family reunion but forget any notions of taking a actual vacation. The Covid threat is the same as anywhere in the world and the general situation is not conducive to fun and games. Even as things are beginning to open, it's utterly depressing to see everyone wearing masks. As much as airlines and the tourist business needs income to survive, I would ask just who goes on a vacation during an international crisis where you are obliged to follow onerous heath and safety requirements? Save your money for a better memory.Edited: 10:15 am, August 12, 2020 "
TO: Maybe have a look at the statistics:https:/…countriesRead it carefully. You can see that Brazil is not a good destination for holiday just now.
">>> The Covid threat is the same as anywhere in the world and the general situation is not conducive to fun and games. <<<The coronavirus pandemic is not the same everywhere in the world. Some countries are much worse than others, and Brazil and the US are 2 of the very worst according to every health organization that is gathering statistics. If you don't get infected yourself, or have a relative or close friend who gets infected, you may think your country is doing great. All you have to do is try to visit hospital emergency and ICU units in areas where COVID-19 is out of control and you'll see what the problem is."
Thanks Rokatoo. I appreciate your advice. I'll let them know. The hotel owner on the island is saying that it'll be open and they do have a fight there. They're saying that it's 25% occupancy for all of Sept. We will see. Thanks again for all of your advice!

"well... as of now, as regular tourists, they are very unlikely to be able to board the flight (even if it is scheduled; flight may not even happen)... anyone's guess if that will change by Sept.FEN is a unique jurisdiction in Brazil; it has completely diff rules from rest of the country (e.g. people cannot move there - even Brazilian citizens; only close relatives of residents and certain workers can move there... women cannot give birth to a child there - due to lack of better medical care if there are complications which would involve a costly medical evac flight; they have to relocate to Recife several weeks before due date... )[some years ago, my sister sprained her ankle at FEN... we went to the only local hospital and it did not even have anything like a cast... the on-call doctor offered saline solution... we are like, what the heck, saline solution for a sprained ankle?... since then, it has certainly improved some, but FEN is definitely not a place to get seriously sick or have an accident... you will need a flight to REC to get adequate treatment]and the fact it is an isolated island makes it very easy to enforce rules... there is no boat passenger service; only way to get there is by plane; so everything is done at airport.I would not take the word of ONE hotel owner - that was the ""wishful thinking"" I referred to... I understand his/her motivations - trying to hold on to existing reservation in the hope that by Sept ""life will be back to normal"".., but his/her interests may not be aligned with your son's... be aware of ""listening to what one wants to hear...""so that you know the current flight situation in FEN... there is one flight per week (Azul) operating for returning residents and essential workers... there may be an extra flight August 20 for more essential workers (the island relies on the mainland for basically everything...)do not take my word,,, check for yourself... go to Gol and Azul websites... they show ""flight status"" (Status do voo in Portuguese)... see what flights are actually operating to/from FEN these days...https://www.voegol.com.br/enhttps://www.voeazul.com.br/also go to REC airport (main gateway to FEN) website and see if any flight departures/arrivals to/from FEN show up... you will see a lot of Azul flights to other destinations, as REC is a secondary hub for Azul:https:/…Informacoes-de-voo.htmlif you really want to be thorough, do the same for NAT airport (which, in normal times, has some flights to/from FEN too):https://www.natal.aero/en/as they already have plane tkts, they may choose to wait and see what happens by then and hope that flights and FEN will be open for regular tourists... but being fully aware that the trip may not take place in the end... their call. good luck!"
">>> Do your own research and draw your conclusions.https:/…registros <<<The numbers I saw were wacky and looks like the site has a data corruption problem for the numbers you listed. If you click on the Covid-19 link on the left side, you'll see a graph showing COVID-19 deaths. There was a 3 month stretch between May and August that showed 800-900 deaths per day. At that rate 100,000+ deaths from COVID-19 in Brazil is understandable.You could also have watched the news and seen mass graves being dug in cities like Manaus and Sao Paulo to handle all the additional deaths from COVID-19.Edited: 8:41 pm, August 12, 2020 "
"something so that your son/his girlfriend can get info from the horse's mouth...... as mentioned, FEN is a unique jurisdiction in Brazil - it does not have an elected mayor like other municipalities,,, instead, it has an ""island manager"" appointed by the government of the state of Pernambuco (which FEN belongs to)....... his name is Guilherme Rocha and he has an official instagram page, where he posts updates about island matters (covid19; restrictions; changes etc).... that would be one of the first places for one to see news of FEN re-opening to regular tourists (and under what conditions):https:/…incidentally... his last post from today is that he caught covid19 and thus is banned from returning to the island for at least 14 days... his wife also got covid19...right now, everyone allowed into FEN (residents and essential workers) must have a negative covid19 test less than one week old (or a positive test for antibodies less than 90 days old) before boarding flight,. and then quarantine in FEN and (or?) take another covid19 test upon arrival and wait for results (which are likely sent to REC for processing,,,)..."
"after being off-limits for tourists since March, Fernando de Noronha (FEN) will start allowing certain tourists in Sept.according to announcement by ""island manager"", only tourists that can prove that they have already had and recovered from covid19 will be allowed at first.details here:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g30345…and in the instagram acct of ""island manager"":https:/…"
