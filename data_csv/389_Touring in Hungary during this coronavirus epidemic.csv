"Is it safe to travel in Hungary during this coronavirus period. I dont mean mean viral transmissons, i am asking the sentiments of the people against ethnic chinese touring in budapest."
"Yes, it's safe.The first 2 COVID-19 cases in Hungary are Iranians, so we can't blame Chinese people for spreading the virus.This morning I saw an East Asian looking guy in my local railway station. He looked totally relaxed and nobody paid any attention to him."
"I would say Hungary is more racist than most Western countries but people aren't in your face about it. You will probably experience people keeping their distance from you but I would expect that to be all. Let's just say Asian restaurants aren't as busy as they used to be. But tbh, it seems.like all bars and restaurants are quite empty nowdays. I'm taking it as an opportunity to travel cheap, just trying to avoid being quarantined."
"""I would say Hungary is more racist than most Western countries but people aren't in your face about it. ""Why do you think so?It can't be personal experience, because you're white.Let's see this Afro-American university professor teaching in Budapest since many years, says he feels much better and experienced much less(if any) racism in Hungary than in his own country.globoport.hu/140228/…"
"Come on Luftmensch,I sometimes have a strong feeling you are not from Hungary at all, based on many a answers of yours, or you are too young to understand some things:(Yes Chris is damn right.In private 75% of the population can talk ONLY about a middle-eastern nation and people of non traditional orientation and of course about our minority people if you know what I mean. We are trying to overtake Russia in that sense and it looks like we are going to succeed if this trend follows.Just last Saturday we had to attend a politician's birthday party and in the vicinity of the nearest 15-20 people to me, there were talks only about ever boring Trianon (and I am telling this as person who also has come from one of the lost territories) and migrants and tons of jokes have been shared. 90% of the jokes had political character and would be considered EXTRA racist in most countries of the world. here they just had enormous waves of laughter.But naturally in public they all (the guests present) are the nicest guys ever.Also I have personally witnessed the distance keeping at the Premiere outlet center about 2 weeks ago. When a bunch of Chinese people and their interpreter (definitely they were, cause | speak a little bit of the language) entered one store, all other customers quickly moved to the other side of the store, some even left. All in all, not everybody can hide his feelings..."
** The first 2 COVID-19 cases in Hungary are Iranians ....**Do you happen to know if they were tourists or just students living in Hungary? I work for the most active travel agency in the country and our outgoing tours cancelled entirely due to COVID-19 outbreak.The world is something of a curate's egg with racism as part of the mix and not endemic to one specific country.

"Oh its very easy to imagine.Just watch the videos online about the ""Welcome parties"" organized in ""favor"" of some poor Ukrainians evacuated from China like blocking the roads with burning tires (this is now a hit action over there, comes trouble), severe clashes with riot police, etc. They even had to change 2 airports, because nobody wanted them. In Lviv some folks were singing the national anthem after the plane was directed to another airport in the eastern part of the country. No kidding, its all available on YouTube. All this of course among hallelujahs about the omnipotent Ukrainian nation, like my former university mates nowadays call themselves. They brag all the time: ""We are a nation now, a great nation""!!! Kinda übermensch. Only tiny difference that a few hundred years ago, those poor evacuees would be simply slaughtered and burned to ashes, just to be sure the disinfection went well..."
"By the way, we have the third confirmed case now. In Debrecen. A Hungarian guy who returned from Milan on February 29.Looks like China is slowly but definitely rolling back into the shadow.Italy is the main Boogeyman now. At least in Europe for sure!"
"** No kidding, its all available on YouTube....**That is simply horrible. This proofs mankind can be as deadly as Coronavirus. Hope we can also find a vaccine against mankind :-)"
"** Italy is the main Boogeyman now **Thus far, Italy, Iran and South Korea all struggling the most with the pandemic after mainland China. I suspect that U.S might debouch to the forefront if Trump keep underestimating the outbreak."
"I guess.you can't call some of my experiences racism...but yeah I've experienced xenophobia. Hungarians used to be welcoming of foreigners but times have changed. Oddly enough, black people are among the least oppressed."
"""but yeah I've experienced xenophobia.""What happened exactly? I'm all ears!""Hungarians used to be welcoming of foreigners but times have changed.""Perhaps you should leave Budapest more often and spend some time in the countryside to realise that Hungarians are still very welcoming of foreigners. To be honest big city folks are rarely known for their hospitality anywhere in the world and and given the side effects of overtourism I can't blame the locals in Budapest if they got a bit jaded with foreigners. Have you ever been a guest of Hungarians in Transylvania? ""Oddly enough, black people are among the least oppressed.""Because they're not oppressed at all. Come one, who is oppressed in Hungary? Nobody, or at least not more than Hungarians themselves.If course I can easily understand that you have a different idea of this, if you get your information from the foreign mainstream media instead of talking to locals and experiencing the reality. I can't blame foreigners if they have some weird ideas of Hungary, but I'd expect more from expats.Edited: 9:52 am, March 06, 2020 "
"** Oddly enough, black people are among the least oppressed **Interesting. That is a beacon of hope :-) Since you live there, I must trust your observation than my own limited empirical data. For the most part the racism, xenophobia and other social transgressions are concomitants of precarious economy. The strong economy seem to make people more tolerant and affable. About 30 years ago, people in my hometown could not stand Afghan workers who seemed sweet, hardworking and willing to take any type of jobs. Once the economy started to show annual growth in double digits, suddenly everyone wanted to have Afghan labors."
"Well, there are a bit less blacks in Hungary than Jews and Christians(who are not oppressed either) in Iran, so even if we wanted to oppress them, we would need to find them first. :-)In my experience Hungarian may be suspicious of foreigners who don't look like Hungarians, but once they get to know them even just a little bit they'll be treated not based on their race or religion but based on their behaviour.People are happy to have a black doctor, since there is a severe shortage of doctors, but they're not happy to have black drug dealers, because we have more than enough local drug dealers. :-)I recall a few years ago people voted a Yemeni doctor(he is living in Hungary since he fineshed university here) to be a doctor of the year. So much for xenophobia or islamophobia in Hungary. Everyone gets what he deserves. ""The strong economy seem to make people more tolerant and affable.""I think that practice is often quite different from this theory. How tolerant are Saudis towards Shias? Jews towards Arabs or Christians? Japanese towards any foreigner?""About 30 years ago, people in my hometown could not stand Afghan workers who seemed sweet, hardworking and willing to take any type of jobs.""Yes, but keep in mind there is also a cultural factor besides an economic one. Afghans have the same religion and most speak a similar language than Persians. So on the long term they can be integrated relatively easily if the economic conditions are good, but imagine these Afghans in Finland for example where they totally stand out.I remember watching Baran, a beaitiful Iranian movie on Hungarian TV many years ago about the Afghans in Iran.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baran_(film)I wish they would show Damascus Time too, but I'm afraid this won't happen given our relations with the USA and Israel. :-)https://youtu.be/easPp3ojvXYIt looks like it beats any stupid Hollywood action movie, especially because it tells the truth!Edited: 11:03 am, March 06, 2020 "
"Oppressed was the wrong word...discriminated against would be the better one. As for examples, I'll choose not to give them. It only fans the flames. I'll say that I resisted the level of racism in the country, but working here and having many foreigner friends working here makes it impossible to ignore. To be clear, my team accepted me with no issues...but due to my line of work, my team is a bit unorthodox. I have only experienced a couple instances where someone who actually knows or even recognizes me has displayed xenophobia, but such is the nature of any discrimination. You may hate muslims...except that muslim you are friends with who isn't like the rest of them. Not all Hungarians are racist and few are xenophobes...I find people are either very open or very closed. I've plenty of Hungarian friends none I would call xenophobes though some have targeted elements of racism...my wife is Hungarian and I've spent plenty of time in Transylvania...but Transylvanian Hungarians are a different lot from Hungarian Hungarians. They smile :-) I try not to comment on politics, but I can't help but think the politics of Hungary are encouraging xenophobia and racism. Like I said, I felt quite special visiting here 10 years ago...and I still feel the same in Transylvania (Hungarian or Romanian). There are other changes such as property price increases, increase in other prices, and overtourism that also play a part...these things are understandable."
"I have to use my stupid ""come on"" again:)Come on Luftmensch. You should have red the posts just a little bit more cautiously. Then you've probably would be aware of fact that Chris's wife is from Transylvania. Just like that.Contrary to your example of the Yemeni doctor, I can remind you of the outrageous hatred and discrimination against the star of the movie ""The Citizen"". You probaly heard of that that Guinea Bissau born man, who live in Hungary since 1976. How many times while driving the tram he was shout at ""Go back to Africa"" and alike. Also how many times his written or telephone application was very much welcomed, but the very moment he showed up for the interview in person, he was immediately told that the position was ""already taken"" by someone else. Sic. By the way, he said that during the good ole commie times students from Africa were very much welcomed and also very well treated by Hungarian females:))NOT anymore!Last but not least, maybe they smile or very nice people, but at a recent politician friend's birthday party (right wing) there were quite a few guests from Transylvania. can't recall how many (90% extremely racist) Szekler (Székely) jokes I had to suffer through. Hatred was also present not only in jokes and comments, but also against food, like inedible rubbish called Italian Pizza or seafood eaten but certain nations, etc., etc. Naturally they didn't like my comments like: ""Carp is the lower class people's food in the US"" At least that what I heard from many southern states tourists:)"
"By the way hrh747,This ""The Citizen"" movie might be of great interest to you. The third main character and very important person concerning the whole plot is a girl from Iran!!!You can find this movie in dubbed or with English subs as well. Just do a bit of web search."
"Luftmensch, when our son was studying at LSE, his girlfriend was of Gujarati extraction, though born and raised in Manchester. When Hungarian friends found out, they were horrified - we were constantly asked 'doesn't the fact that she is black worry you ?'. They were equally horrified when we laughed and answered 'why on earth would it ? she is a lovely girl, what does the colour of her skin matter ?'.And I am talking about educated people, doctors, lawyers etc, not uneducated folk. I have heard a senior doctor in a Hungarian hospital make the most appalling comments about Roma people.Note that I am not claiming the British are paragons of virtue, we have plenty of racists of our own, though you would struggle to find a racist doctor in the UK tg."
"""Carp is the lower class people's food in the US"". Bela, thanks for a good laugh on a miserable Saturday morning here in Britain :)Edited: 2:07 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Roman Citizen,Why I am not surprised at all of your sons story:) I tell you more: Contrary what Luftmensch has said about very friendly people in the country versus Budapest dwellers, I can only add a bit of my personal experience.At my father's side relatives (all living in a few neighboring smaller villages) there was a very high nonacceptance of my Ukrainian wife (quite white by the way:) ). My grandmother even refused to talk to her (we paid a visit after the wedding), saying she would want to see her (my wife) again only when she will learn to speak Hungarian!!!"
"Sounds like some Americans' attitudes to Mexicans, Bela. Let's face it. Racism and xenophobia are found around the world. You battle it through travel and meeting new people. No matter what country I'm in, most people just want to have a fairly good standard of living, enjoy family and friends and work and save. We're more alike INSIDE than we are different OUTSIDE."
** We're more alike INSIDE than we are different OUTSIDE. **Well said (applaud).
"#20""I have heard a senior doctor in a Hungarian hospital make the most appalling comments about Roma people.""He must be talking from experience rather than prejudice.No wonder many doctors and nurses hate them when they frequently suffer from their abuse and even physical violence. It's hard not be a racist when it is always the same people who are shouting at you, spitting at you, threatening you with cutting your throat while you're trying to save their life. I can't imagine a more disgusting behaviour than attacking those who are trying to help you.So moch for being more alike inside….Edited: 12:16 am, March 09, 2020 "

"It's not me spouting such filth, it is the Roma patients and their ""little"" family who are all too often spouting racist and sexist filth on the medical staff trying to treat them. Sometimes it's not only words they're spouting, simply spouting. In worst cases they even attack them physically.This is the real problem, not the alleged racism. If the doctors and nurses start to hate them after such atrocities it is only a consequence.Of course such cases get rarely reported in the foreign media, because it doesn't fit their agenda, but here is a recent exception where a Roma who suffred a heart attack died while the ambulance was waiting for police escort. You can read above the possible reason why an ambulance needs police escort when it's going for certain type of patients in Hungary(and not only in Hungary).errc.org/news/romani-man-dies-while-paramedi…As you can see this is from a Roma rights site, and they're presenting this issue as if the Roma were discriminated but in case you can read between the lines you may be a bit wiser:""The National Ambulance Service (OM) claimed that police cover was needed because the ambulance had received threatening and abusive telephone calls.""""When they call the emergency, they are often very arrogant. I don’t even feel like talking to them. They call the ambulance for no reason.""""Csenyéte, described in the media as the poorest village in Hungary, has not had a local GP for more than ten years.""One can't help, but wonder why no doctor wants to live in such an idyllic village full of poor, but lovely locals who are happy to have a doctor in their community.The UK is about to introduce rules that racist and sexist patients can be turned away from non-emergency care. I think Hungary should make similar rules, but no doubt the MSM presstitutes, AI and the likes would be soon attacking Hungary with headlines like Roma getting denied healthcare in Hungary.As I always say you don't need much effort or IQ to cry racism(a gender studies degree from CEU will do), instead of trying to understand the reason behind racism(if you have to insist on calling it racism)Edited: 2:39 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Nice monologue but your thesis falls apart with one simple question. Are all Roma like that?Then in order to solve the question, you need to ask why they act that way. The issues they have are around how they were raised...their culture.. it's not an issue with their genetic makeup. You seem to think as such...and your toxic thoughts are what leads to genocide. Most people, even Roma, want to be civilized. But when you don't allow them an exit from their culture (becaise.of prejudice) they have no choice but to adopt their culture.I'm not an expert on the Roma but in the US blacks are in a similar place to the Roma here. I was on the board of an organization working with them. Maybe if you volunteered even for a day with an organization helping Roma, your perspective would change."
"""Are all Roma like that?""Who said that?But even if only 10% of them are like this, we're talking about 100 thousand people. You can imagine that even if you suffer such an incident only once, the next time you see a Roma you'll be afraid of them.Hungary has a dozen minorities. Why is it that it is never the Germans, the Jews, the Ruthenians, the Slovaks, the Croatians, etc who attack doctors, paramedics, firefighters?I just don't get this. I can understand that they hate policemen(I'm not fond of them either and I'm not a criminal), but why attack people who are working to help them: doctors, teachers, firefighters. It is beyond all reason.""The issues they have are around how they were raised...their culture.. it's not an issue with their genetic makeup. You seem to think as such…""I agree 100% that it is their culture and most people in Hungary think the same way. Roma represent at least 10% of the population of Hungary and they're living all over the country so I don't think there is anyone in this country who doesn't know Roma who are not like that and live a normal life, but unfortunately too many are living in a way that simply doesn't fit into a civilised society. I don't think I ever said that it has to do with genetics.""Most people, even Roma, want to be civilized.""Unfortunately many of them don't even know what it means to be civilized and what's worse they don't even want to learn, becuse they think they're better than the gadjos. If you're looking for racism, you'd better look around the Roma, you'll find racism much easier among them than among Hungarians.""But when you don't allow them an exit from their culture (becaise.of prejudice) they have no choice but to adopt their culture.""The choice is given for them, The living proof are the many Roma who are normal members of our society. I can imagine it's not easy for them to leave their traditional life behind, but if so many of them managed despite all odds, why is that the rest doesn't even try it?They have the same rights as every Hungarian. Free education, free textbooks, free meals in the school for poor pupils, free healthcare. All they have to do is go to school and learn from their teachers (not mock them, taunt them, threaten them with violence, sexist remarks, etc. as they often do).The family background is of course much different, but we can't change that unless we take away the kids from their families and take them to some internats, but as similar efforts in Canada and Australlia has shown these may not work either and only cause more suffering than benefits.""I'm not an expert on the Roma but in the US blacks are in a similar place to the Roma here.""It seems to me that blacks are much better integrated into US society plus there is a big difference(although it is a historical one and doesn't actually matter much anymore but still): Blacks were brought to America against their will, but nobody told the Roma to come to live in Hungary.Not to mention while blacks were still fighting against official(!) discrimination in the Southern states in the 60's there was no such discrimination against Roma in Hungary.Edited: 12:17 am, March 09, 2020 "

HelloDid you ever get a reply for your question? I’m due to travel to Budapest on Thursday returning to the UK on Sunday - am I still ok to travel?
"Hi LauraThere's a far greater risk of catching coronavirus here in the UK. I would think that Budapest is one of the safer places to be at the moment. I'm going on March 23rd and I'm not concerned at all, though obviously I'll be keeping an eye on developments."
"I'd be more concerned about airports and airplanes than about Budapest, at least for now"
hi hoping return Budapest this week I yhink safer than being here in shelted f;ats as could be isolated if other tenant is most restaurant market halls open with thanks
But to get to Budapest we v got to get on the planes and in the airports!!
Don’t think anyone answered the question did they???! I’ve never heard so much drivel in my life! How inappropriate are the comments in this thread. I though it was supposed to be a travel forum?? Not a sounding board for politics??
"The OP had a very specific questions, not about the effects of coronavirus in general, but, I'm quoting the OP here:""I dont mean mean viral transmissons, i am asking the sentiments of the people against ethnic chinese touring in budapest.""This topic is not about coronavirus, there is another topic for that! It is about sentiments against ethnic Chinese and I think #1(myself) and #2 answered this as good as you can:""Yes, it's safe.""""we can't blame Chinese people for spreading the virus.""""I saw an East Asian looking guy ... He looked totally relaxed and nobody paid any attention to him.""""You will probably experience people keeping their distance from you but I would expect that to be all.""The question of OP has been answered in the first couple of posts and he may ignore the rest of the topic if he's not interested in that off topic discussion.Edited: 3:50 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I'm not sure anyone can answer your question. Budapest is safe. If you're worried about being in an airport/plane, well that's something you'll have to decide for yourself.I can only speak for myself, but I'll feel more comfortable on a plane than I would on a packed train or bus. The airport represents no greater risk than a busy shopping centre. But that's me. If you don't feel comfortable going then don't go."
thanks shaun ive booked moment hotel for a week from this Thursday excited thanks
Hi has anyone who is or has been in Budapest in last 3 weeks England has now got plastic twenty pound notes sre they being accepted at change shops old ones are still in use with thanks
oh sorry meant to ask new question
"Scottish Lady, I guess you'll be OK for coming two weeks in Hungary as they have no travel directives against people arriving from the UK yet.Being a small, not so rich country with less locals travelling to risk areas, it seems quite a few weeks behind developments in other European countries. Any restrictions are unlikely to affect your holiday ... things which may get shut down are likely to be large crowds like football matches and pop concerts.Your local airport is likely to be really quiet, so little risk there, or indeed a flight between so far two not much affected countries.Just make sure you have an up to date EHIC card, should you need medical treatment. You'll be welcomed to a Budapest much quieter of tourists than usual, which has its advantages. But fearful of what the future couple of months holds for European tourism, will it all end up like in Italy ?"
"GBP is one of the major world currencies, exchange bureau and banks will be well briefed on the new banknotes."
"Luftmench has a point.OP posted a question about discrimination of oriental races in light of Covid-19. New bogeymen in Europe are Italians, or indeed any returning visitors from Northern Italy. 75% of UK's 400 cases can be traced back to Italy.But Italians look just like us all, so thick racists will target people who look different. Propensity for oriental tourists to wear face masks opens them up to suspicion.Face masks do not protect against Covid-19, indeed they can make you more susceptible to infection outside of strict regularly changed clinical use, and are only good to prevent someone already infected from spreading the virus."
"I was shocked to see this topic asking an innocent question about racism to visitors in light of Covid-19, turn into a racist diatribe against the Roma.I like this forum going off topic sometimes as it keeps those most knowledgeable interested enough to stay on. But racism and bigotry is not OK. My cousin is a Védőnő in NE Hungary. She looks after children from birth until they start school. She visits families regularly to ensure children are healthy, have inoculations, on call for urgent issues. Half her patch is Roma villages, which she visits in Summer on her scooter, Winter in her ageing Nissan Micra. She is absolutely non-judgemental, she loves children, and Roma families love her back.We went to see a historic Romanesque church in a 100% Roma village (was in architectural guidebook), could have been scary, but playing kids and adults waved when they saw Márti's car.Stories of ambulances needing police escort to help critically ill patients in similar communities , just shows how racism erects barriers.Roma are different, and can never be integrated fully into a Hungarian culture. Communism tried and failed. Post Communist government has never even tried ... witness the squalor and deprivation of village and communities. Sure some integrate, but hide /sacrifice their culture to do it. There needs to be a solution to make 300,000 Roma value their unique place in Hungarian society, and Hungarians accept them as equals. Won't be easy, but those who say it can never be achieved because of some ""racial malevolence"" are the biggest racists themselves."
yeah got ehic hrealh card coming tomorrow for week hope market halls open I love them wont do museums or parliament dione that last time end of January whats weather like but warning anyone in Budapest I like the song tend to bring weather with me staying moments hotel a different area this time with thanks
