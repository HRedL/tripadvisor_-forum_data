Any word on if Key West will be shutting down or scaling back due to coronavirus? We are set to come into town 3/22-3/27. Things are starting to get scary and we are considering cancelling our trip.
"Right now things here are business as usual. It’s not clear if that will stay the same. There are no confirmed cases yet, but they’re not really testing anyone. As of last night, the entire State of Florida has only tested just under 500 people in a State with a population of over 30 million.I have personally decided to postpone a trip I had planned to Chicago and to avoid crowded places, but everyone has to do what they’re comfortable with.Edited: 10:34 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"SDT,A huge outbreak in Illinois is predicted in four week time in the middle of April. So far, we have over 30 cases in Illinois. Schools start to cancel after school activities. Spring breaks are extended in universities. We got notified students might have to stay and do all their work online. So far, K-12 schools are open, but it might change by day. Nothing unusual so far, but you do take notice of people heading to Sams Club and preparing for close downs.Edited: 12:09 am, March 13, 2020 "
Everything is being canceled and delayed in South Florida. I would wait till this blows over but that just me.
"We're supposed to by flying from London 25th for a 2x week trip starting in Miami, travelling the Keys and then back to Miami and are really worried.Unless the airline cancels or Trump extends the measures to exclude flights from UK also then we won't get anything back from British Airways and can't even change the flights without a huge fee currently."
I’m wondering if / when US will halt domestic air travel.
"I typically travel 2 to 3 weeks a month for business. Mostly long-haul flights from NJ to CA or Europe. However, my company (and most other Fortune 500 companies) have now halted all business travel (domestic and international) for the next few weeks (our restriction is through April 19th.) I just canceled a flight to the UK for next week and another one to Denver for the following week. I just flew home from San Diego this week and the plane was probably less than half full. I'm not sure the government will need to ban domestic travel - my guess is the airlines will further curtail flights more than they already have due to financial considerations. Why fly empty planes? With that being said, I still plan on flying to KW in early April. I'll do what I did this week - wash my hands constantly in the airport and on the plane, sanitize my entire seating area with Clorox wipes and liberal use of hand sanitizer. Obviously things could change in the next 3 weeks, but if I have to hunker down and practice ""social distancing"" I'd rather do it poolside at our rental in KW!"
Thanks for that info jtwiz.
"We were coming down on the 18th and have made the decision to postpone this trip. The current situation is so fluid and changing. I work in healthcare and things are changing on a daily/hourly basis. We too, thought about quarantine ourselves right in Key West, but probably not practical if we get stuck there or anywhere (other than home) for an extended period of time. Also not willing to be the one who brings the illness into Key West. Stay Healthy - and wash those hands!"
Monroe County official’s ( that’s the keys) posted guidance today to avoid gathers of 1000 or more.I think things are changing day to day.
"My husband and I are scheduled to arrive in KW on 4/23. Yesterday our airline (American) announced no change fee on flights scheduled through April 30th. Our hotel has a 7 day cancellation policy. I imagine we'll make a decision in the next couple weeks but we are leaning towards postponing until later in the year unfortunately.Edited: 8:52 am, March 13, 2020 "
As much as we love KW all of our plans are on hold.Curious as to the impact this will have on KW. It surely will hurt and put many out of work.
"Take no offense at this, but everytime there is a storm coming, the stores around here empty themselves of toilet paper (for some unknown and very strange reason). There is ""being prepared"" and then there is insanity. We will be in Key West at the end of March unless they close the Overseas Highway. We are flying INTO FLL and OUT of MIA. We have family in West Palm and they get us first. If I get sick, or my wife gets sick prior to getting on our flight in two weeks, we won't go and I will be begging for forgiveness from the hotels. Otherwise, maybe we will have Key West to ourselves and I won't have to wear my loin cloth on Smathers."
"We already have a water shortage in Tampa and yes many are grabbing up supplies for a a 2 week stay. Bit crazy at this point but with the lack of testing who knows if it might be them,.What scares us is not KW but the people getting on planes and bringing it,"
"My wife and I have a flight in on 3/17. We are so torn on what to do. We come every March, and the thought of not coming is gut wrenching. A week ago I didn’t think there was anyway we wouldn’t be there but now I’m just not sure. I don’t know if we will cause more harm being there during a stressful fluid situation for all. At the same time I’m not sure if staying home and not spending money there is a desirable result either. Any advice would be appreciated."
I was wondering when this thread would start. Reported today of the 128K cases reported world wide so far 70K have recovered. I'm told planes are safe to fly on because the air is filtered. Still coming in June!! ~~/)~~
"We leave 3/18 and are really hoping to be able to go, but taking it day by day to see what happens. I'm going to pack this weekend and just keep watching."
"Christopher, the information about planes is not correct. Most infections are by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face.You can clean your seat and video screens and minimize your risk, but filtered air isn’t going to do much.The best advice remains to wash your hands regularly and to try not to touch your face, which is harder than it seems..Edited: 11:48 am, March 13, 2020 "
"I saw this yesterday..Thanks Wayne for sharing with me...KEYS TOURISM ADVISORY March 12, 2020 • 10 a.m.News and information from the Monroe County Tourist Development CouncilCoronavirus Update for Florida Keys:Earlier this week, the first confirmed coronavirus patient in Florida was interviewed by a Sarasota/Bradenton iHeart radio station. While the person’s name was kept confidential, the information the 61-year-old Manatee County male communicated on-air matched that reported to the Florida Department of Health. Specifically, the man reported that he believes he contracted the disease during a Key West stay that ended Feb. 9, 2020.The health department conducted an epidemiological investigation, but found no evidence to support that it was contracted in Key West. Because no other confirmed coronavirus cases have emerged on the island and the incubation period from this case has passed, there is no epidemiological evidence that the patient’s infection originated in Key West.As of Thursday morning, there are no confirmed cases of the virus in the Florida Keys and there are no people in the Keys currently under investigation, according to Bob Eadie, the administrator and health officer for the Florida Department of Health in Monroe County, who added that the risk for coronavirus transmission in the Keys is low at this time.It is important to understand that the coronavirus situation is extremely fluid and changing on a daily basis.• The health and safety of Florida Keys visitors and residents are a top priority.• There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Keys and currently there are no potential cases being investigated, according to Bob Eadie, the Keys’ top health official.• There are no travel restrictions to and from the Florida Keys at this time.• Keys county and municipal officials are prepared and continue to prepare to aggressively deal with coronavirus, if needed. Officials and the Keys medical community are on high alert to respond, if necessary.• Cruise ship passengers traveling to the port of Key West are aggressively screened for symptoms of COVID-19 before boarding and are monitored while onboard. All cruises that dock in Key West originate from U.S. ports."

"Regarding the Monroe County advisory, I just want to point out that only about 500 people have been tested Statewide and only a couple in Monroe County. It seems disingenuous to keep repeating there are no “confirmed” cases when there are not many tests and many people only have mild symptoms.I guess we will learn more in the coming days."
"And screening of passengers is manly self report and maybe a temp. That’s basically a joke.As for the gentlemen in Sarasota, he probably didn’t get it here but that doesn’t mean it’s not here,"
Right SDT. I forgot to add that part. ~~/)~~
"Silver has posted a waiving of change and cancellation fees on their web page ---> https:/…covid-19PjkEdited: 1:48 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"For the last nine years my wife and I have stayed a month in Key West. This year would have been our tenth year. It was an agonizing decision but two days ago we cancelled. We are/were 30 days out from arrival so will receive a 50% property refund but that was not the lone deciding factor. We are a month from arrival date and would have been staying a month. We decided trying to predict what two months in the future will bring was impossible. Regarding a shorter visit, given the current testing fiasco there is no way to determine COVID 19 hotspots or presence. We will stay home for awhile and do our share in flattening the curve. :)"
We are flying from Michigan to Fort Myers on 3/20 and taking the KW Express on the 21st. We are coming. Wash your hands and stop watching the news. And for the love of God why are people hoarding toilet paper lol!
Thank you pufferdog
"I find it somewhat offensive that county health officials are taking such a cavalier attitude to this pandemic. People in Monroe County are being denied tests because they are following the strict requirements that the CDC, greatly limiting access to testing. So sure, there are no cases because they aren't testing. Community spread has been confirmed in Florida, but our county government is more concerned about the almighty tourist dollar than its citizens and guests. The Marathon Seafood Festival is still being held, absolutely no events have been cancelled. Business as usual, money money money!Very interesting article, heavy on the science. I'm looking to scientists, not politicians.https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99caEdited: 2:33 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Carol, there have been cancelations, the American cancer society gala and the 7 mile run for example. Not enough and too few imo."
I heard they are considering closing the highway for a couple of weeks?
"David, they don’t even do that for a hurricane. It’s not like they want to keep us from getting home."
Stay close to home.
"I'm glad some local organizations are taking this seriously. Flattening the curve is essential, I'm saddened our local government seems more concerned about tourist dollars than public health."
"The beautiful water is always here, and there will always be a place to eat and drink. Also streets might be less crowded to ride a bike"
I agree with bssskins! ~~/)~~
For now the risk is too high to travel. Best thing to at this point is just stay at home and avoid going out. I do trust they will come up with a cure. No idea how bad it is in KW right now but Tampa has gone crazy to the point you can't even buy toilet paper or water. If you live in KW your just as safe as anyplace. I darn sure would not be sitting at any bar with dozens of others.
Three big cruise lines shut down for 30 days ---> https:/…ampPjk
"Why toilet paper? You'd think it would be paper towels because of all the cleaning we're supposed to be doing. You could wipe your backside with a paper towel, but you ever try to wipe down a counter with Charmin?"
Can only tell you that stores here have ran out. I thought the same about TP but it happened. Shelves at Walmart are empty on many items.
"Nope, unless I am told I must stay home, we are driving to Key West in a couple weeks.If people don't spend money, it's the little guys who hurt. The room attendents, the bartenders, servers, dive captains, boat owners etc.You can be smart about things and still travel locally.There are small businesses that will not survive this."
"Pufferdog, We were scheduled to be in Key West on 3/17 and made reservations through Booking.com. We postponed and were able to get a full refund on a non refundable room. Contact the hotel or your third party and they will try to work with you. We were also able to cancel a night in Key Largo and get fully refunded."
"Fred, your missing the point. Those are the very people likely to catch it. Short time it might be hard on them. Long term they might be dead or KW will not get many tourists, Then what ?"
"Since this string of virus is mild for most healthy adults, I wonder how they will truly know the number affected? The ones that have mild symptoms are not going to their doctors to get tested. Right now, my wife and I have congestion and a cough. Do we have it? We went to a beerfest at the convention center a couple weekends ago, but it's very unlikely that we'll ever be tested."
"I dont remember this kind of mass hysteria back in 2009 with the H1N1 Swine flu when over 60 million Americans had it and over 12,000 died."
"https:/…Edited: 12:53 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"I hope people are taking this seriously. Up here in PA we are in lock down mode. They are asking us to stay home for the next 2 weeks. Schools, gyms, and non essential retail are all closed. The message isn’t about whether I personally get sick. The message is to slow the spread. The local hospitals are concerned they wouldn’t have enough equipment to deal with a mass incident. Lucky the weather here is nice right now and we are making the best of things."
"This is why I'm so frustrated and angry with our local government here in the Keys. They are acting like since we don't have cases yet it's business as usual. The article about tourism on flkeysweekly.com yesterday had my blood boiling.We have the data, exponential growth is happening, and here in Key West the only concern is the flow of tourist dollars."
"From this local, it feels like the good ol' boy system we have in place here is clueless."
It’s all about the cash.
"We’re due in Key West on April 9. Have just heard about the travel ban.Totally understandable but nevertheless am totally devastated.Hoping that the situation is resolved sooner than later, not much we can do about it at the moment, our travel company is rightly proritising those due to travel within the next 72 hours , so we’re in limbo right now.The annoying thing is that I had a call from our travel rep in Miami on Thursday to check we had our esta’s and when I voiced my concerns about the virus she told me it wasn’t anything to worry about."
We were thinking of going to KW for a few days. Sorry but not risking it till this gets under control and that could be months as new cases are keeping it alive. Am glad to hear no cases yet in KW but that could change any day. Most survive but for elderly odds are not as good. Hopefully the food hording will stop. Water issue I do not understand.
I'm planning on going may 5th. God I hope I won't have to cancel.
"We are supposed to head down on 4/18. We won't get a refund on our condo if we don't come. That's $3,000 out the window. Just makes me crazy."
"Lynn, have you contacted the realtor? I’ve heard several examples of people getting refunds or credit for a future stay."
98% of people who get sick recover. It's my opinion that this will blow over it a few weeks. Over 30K people died from the flu last year. Where's the panic over that? We are booked for mid June this year if it's not over by then a round of drinks are on me at the Worlds Smallest Bar! (everyone must be in side the bar to get a drink)! ~~/)~~

"SDT I did contact the owner of the condo and she maintains that if she can't find a replacement renter to take the week, we are out of luck."
We have a reservation at a resort on Anna Maria island for 2 weeks starting the 20th of March. Due to all that’s going on I am concerned about my 74 year old husband flying. This particular resort will not let us change date or give us any type of credit. We are looking to lose over $5000.00
"There are no travel restrictions in the us a this point. I can understand the lack of refunds, ,"
"The keys are packed to the brim. People from everywhere are pouring into the Keys. No testing going on. You are definitely taking a chance. Key West is a 2 x 4 Mike island. Do the math. Stores are empty. Everyone had to decide what is important to them. Remember, if you're infected and don't know it, there will be thousands than you can infect who might not survive."
"We cannot get a refund on our accommodations or change of date either for our reservation in May because we were told no Coronavirus has been confirmed or quarantines reported in the area. If the scenario changes they will be changing the policy. I guess it’s a wait and see what happens for now for us. If businesses are shut down and no supplies are available, it will have to be considered as well. What I have been reading does not make me think this is going away by then. I hope I am wrong. Stay well!"
@62 Where are all these people pouring into the keys? I’ve never seen the town so dead at this time of year. It’s very noticeable the lack of visitors.
HappyBubble. Take no notice. The last time No 62 posted was 4 years ago and that was about the Zika virus!
"HappyBubble, There are usually 2-3 cruise ships in port every day this time of year. Now there are none. Thousands fewer people on the streets makes a big difference.Many locals are following the Government and medical communities’ advice and staying home. I have spoke to some visitors who are also avoiding Duval and crowded venues, spending more time at hotel pools or even in their rooms. Some regret being here.For now, hotels are still at typical occupancy for this time of year. I imagine that may change in the coming weeks as European cancellations start hitting and people become more concerned."
"Well as of now, the US has restricted all travel from Europe and the UK government have advised against all bar essential travel to the states. This may seem odd, but they do this to trigger people’s insurance policies.We’d booked a hotel in the middle keys through booking.com who have emailed me to advise I have until the end of March for a no-cost refund.I’m still hoping for a miracle, obviously.Still waiting to hear from our travel agent about our package, we’re talking about $10k here. Not sure if we’ll be able to go/get a refund/go somewhere else/go later this year or 2021.Have already changed my £ to $ and have no intention of switching them back, whatever happens, God willing, I WILL be back in KW one day, just don’t know when.People here have gone crazy, shops are empty, there’s talk of the over 70’s being told to stay indoors and the government is saying we don’t have enough ventilators or intensive care beds. It’s hard to imagine they’d announce that and cause so much alarm without good reason!So my heart is hoping this will blow over soon, my head is telling me I’m kidding myself.One thing that concerns me is that I’m the UK we have the national health service, I go to a doctor- no charge, he gives me a prescription for drugs - no charge, hospital stay - no charge. Basically people don’t have to think about deductibles or medical bills.So the numbers of infections in America may not yet be really known, I have a lot of respect and affection for Americans so I pray you guys are all safe and well.Final thoughts, as devastated as I am about probably losing my vacation, after Irma and now this, I feel dreadfully sorry for all the guys who look after us, the bar and wait staff, housekeeping, small business owners who will be impacted financially.Sorry for the long post, as you can probably tell, I’m feeling more than a little emotional about this.Long live the conch republic."
Our trip is in 2 weeks - March 30. I went to the live webcam and there aren't many people on Duval Street at all. Are many of the shops and restaurants closed?
I think we are going to see increasingly severe restrictions. Here are our two neighbors to the north:https:/…
"Mayor just declared a state of emergency, but it seems only to free up federal funds, not in any attempt to enact social distance or any such nonsense.By April 1st most places on town will be shut down. Not many businesses will be able to keep their doors open. They may reopen at a later date, but keeping the doors open won't be financially viable much longer. Watching the exponential growth numbers, with no cure or slowdown even remotely possible, we likely have our movement restricted as well."
"Seems like many tourists to the keys are still in party mode and not recognizing how serious this is. Monroe Co. should shut things down now, it’s only going to get worse for now."
"We have a trip planned for mid-April to KW. I would love to go, don't mind getting the virus so much, but I just don't want to expose my family to another round of prepper, apocalyptic food and TP scarcity. Here, in Maine it has been ridiculous this week, schools are cancelled, restaurants are closing, and the stores can't stock the shelves. I don't want to get stuck somewhere just to start over with all that. It's hard enough to get used to one time. So hard to know what to do, especially when your rental agency isn't offering a refund, only a reschedule in the next six months.Edited: 5:46 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I'd bet on everything getting MUCH worse before it gets better. Italy, for example, just today reported that its number of deaths increased by 25% relative to yesterday. Plus 25% nationwide in one day!!!So even if it's (whatever ""it"" is) not shut down today, expect that it WILL get shut down tomorrow. Even if open, people will likely get very nervous if any place gets more crowded than a few people in any establishment. If so, it will definitely not be a good time to be in Key West.Hence, March, April is out. May, June, July, Aug, Sep, Oct: the weather isn't optimal even if the coronavirus somehow gets under control. November is kinda dead. Which brings me to December.I'd reserve for December now as I think it will be far more in demand than usual. Hopefully, that will coincide with the worst of the coronavirus being behind us.Just thinking about an eventual trip in December may be a welcome mood lifter."
"I am reading in the Florida forum and currently, all South Florida location use descriptions like ""packed"" and ""jammed"".Here in Colorado, our ski areas are currently hot beds of infection because the dear tourists came on ski trips … This isn't really about whether or not YOU and YOUR kids will get it hard … its about the grandma of the person you are spreading it to. Having said that - I haven't yet cancelled either and I really, really don't want to .. but I know there will be no choice. I just couldn't bring myself to, just yet . Meanwhile … Norway is calling its citizens home with this memorable phrase: ""This applies especially if you are staying in a country with poorly developed health services and infrastructure and/or collective infrastructure, for example the USA"""
"We are booked for April 19 not in Key West but in Layton. No refunds or change for dates will be made and believe it or not travel insurance does not cover this at least mine didn’t. I’ve tried. We are driving down so don’t need to get a refund from airline. We didn’t plan on going all over just to relax and paddle board. So, unless there is a domestic ban we plan on going."
"Interesting about Norway. I, too, have been thinking about how virtually all other developed countries have universal health coverage and we don't. I remember talking to someone who was so glad they removed the individual mandate so that he could now drop his health coverage. I tried to tell him that not having medical insurance was unthinkable for me. I couldn't imagine wondering whether or not I should seek medical intervention for me or any member of my family when it might conceivably end up costing memegabucks.But he smugly said that he was healthy and couldn't imagine ever needing health insurance. Wonder if those types of people are feeling so happy about their decision now. Tens of millions with no health insurance means that many will not seek out medical help when they may really need it...to the detriment of the rest of us."
"“Keep Calm and Keys On” Understanding one might be more susceptible to the virus- would/should mean- use extra precautions and stay away from people until it blows over. People should continue to wash themselves including their hands appropriately. Something one would think this shouldnt have to be addressed but yet I see someone walking out of the bathroom not washing their hands after. It’s a time in our lives where we must step away from being afraid to say anything and address what needs to be addressed. “Don’t be a nasty and not wash your hands; in fact- wash your hands more and don’t hang out with nasties.” Moral of this- use common sense. If there’s an outbreak of a virus the last thing someone should do is go to a store and stand in line with 100s of potential carriers. USE COMMON SENSE. /end rant/ Btw- I’ll be down enjoying a cigar and some rum in KW in less than 20 days. Unless the guard comes in and shuts it all off. Nowadays who knows. Either way at least KW is the best place to sit and watch the world burn.Edited: 7:36 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"You use common sense and please stay home!Everyone thinks they're special and their vacation should go on as scheduled.NO!!! If diligent hand washing was the cure to this epidemic, we wouldn't be where we are.Please follow the CDCs recommendations, no unnecessary travel paired with social distance.Please!!!!"
Maybe calm down with the fear mongering in this thread Carol?
"Please let me know how the situation is. Our trip is planned for March 27th with a non-refundable flight. Our trip was originally to NYC, but had to cancel because EVERYTHING is closed."
Its only fear mongering until YOUR loved one dies .Just sayin'
"I wish I was just being hyperbolic and fear mongering. I really do.A very dear friend lives in Italy and the updates are heartbreaking beyond belief.We have the data, I look to the scientific experts and it is very clear that if we take mitigation measures now we can help flatten the curve. This is vital.I would love nothing more than to be completely wrong!!! But with the information we have and the overwhelming evidence, it is important to follow the CDCs recommendations regarding travel and social distance. Countries around the world are doing the same, with great hesitation but inaction could no longer be tolerated. Ive been greatly negatively impacted financially, it would be in my pocketbook's best interest to carry on. Key West can't continue to allow unabated tourism. Sorry."
"From this local, stop being selfish and put your visit off until this is under control.You're only making it worse. And frankly, most of you aren't even from here, don't own property here and would soon leave if the $hit hit the fan, so spare me the defense.KW needs to protect itself right now, not cater to drunk, foolish tourists."
"I’m glad to see some voices of reason on here. I’m not sure if some people are living in a bubble or don’t believe the news/science/what is already happening elsewhere globally, but this doesn’t seem like a great time to carry on with vacation plans. If you can cancel or reschedule, please do so. More and more stuff is being restricted anyway.I don’t care if *you* are low risk and plan to wash your hands, FL is full of vulnerable elderly people and the idea of social distancing means you stay away from everyone regardless if you personally are at risk. In my opinion, you can either be part of the solution or part of the problem, and unnecessary travel for pleasure right now feels like the latter to me."
"I have had to cancel travel plans to Santa Barbara because I can't be sure the restaurants will even have any food (much less toilet paper). Tasting rooms are closing.With the National Emergency declaration I think most folks are covered for cancelling their trips. Just like when a hurricane is coming.One thing I urge all to do is look up the facts on the corona virus. What scared me the most was that the virus can survive for DAYS on surfaces. And I can't find any hand sanitizer!Makes me really rethink air travel, in spite of all those great deals that I'm starting to see...."
"We are supposed to be coming down this Saturday. While we can change our flights, we're not sure about our rental place. We are calling them today to see what they say. We got the insurance but I'm not sure it covers this. Supposedly most of them don't cover pandemics. If we can get our money back or even just trade for another time we will be cancelling. It's going to be very sad next week when I'm at work rather than in Key West!"
"Just for perspective .. New Orleans Police cleared Bourbon St. with this announcement 'Your actions are jeopardizing public health'All our Colorado Ski areas are hotbed of infections now. People are dying , thanks to the tourists who just had to go on that ski trip or were afraid they wouldn't get their money back. One person's ""I wont get my deposit back"" is another person's dead loved one. Does that sound dramatic? Well, it is not. I am just as affected as you guys … I was looking forward to my Key West fix too. But this is time to put selfishness aside and care about our ""One human family"""
"One of the most alarming things I’m seeing are all the spring breakers filling up bars and traveling in large groups, acting like everything is fine. These people will likely never even show symptoms, but they may bring the virus home to parents and grandparents.I never thought I would say this given that our economy is based almost exclusively on tourism, but I think traveling right now is very irresponsible. The way cases are growing in Florida, I think it’s only a matter of time before the Governor takes the dramatic action we’re seeing in other Stares and mandates closures of bars and restaurants.It’s going to be devastating to business and people here, many just finally recovering from Irma. I know our community will band together and help each other, but people need to pay rent and eat."
"We decided yesterday to cancel. We were supposed to be arriving in 2 days. While I'm sad about this, I know it's the best decision. We will get refunded or be able to rebook our flight. Not sure on our hotel stay, but at this point, the money isn't worth the risk. I've waited 5 years to get back, now it'll just be a little longer. Stay healthy."
"We spent this weekend avoiding the crowds around our Jersey Shore town - there were a ton of people out and about for various St. Patrick's Day celebrations. It was kind of surprising how many bars/restaurants were going forward with those kind of large gatherings. We got takeout from our favorite Italian restaurant, took long walks on our boardwalk, rode bikes, and did a lot of Spring cleaning. I have an elderly (80s) Mom and there is no way I want to infect her. In fact, I am giving myself a full week since my last business flight before I see her again in person. So we are on board with ""social distancing."" Our trip to KW is supposed to start in a little over 3 weeks - while i haven't cancelled our flights yet, I know we won't be going. It's a bummer - we booked our flights last October. We are lucky in that we were using our friends' home, so we can reschedule at a later date at no cost to us. So sad to be missing our longest trip to KW ever (17 nights...) but we know deep in our hearts that things aren't going to be better in 3 weeks and likely to be much worse. Hang in there KW! See you as soon as we can possibly make it back."
You should keep on track with the news and then see if you should cancel your trip or not.
"If you're watching the news, then there's no question regarding whether or not to cancel. Unnecessary travel should be avoided. For everyone. Even you."

"We just changed our dates from end of March to the last week of May. Nobody gave us any problems doing so. While it breaks my heart, it’s the correct thing to do. Hopefully 10 weeks is enough time for this to get under control. I’m a bartender in Ohio and we had to call last call at 9 pm last night for good until further notice. My thoughts are with everyone in the service and hospitality industries today. It’s truly devastating to small businesses up here."
"Can't believe someone on this forum implied our healthcare services are inferior to Norway’s. I’m sure Norway is very lovely but as the spouse of a Doctor I can assure everyone that our healthcare is second to none. President Trump issued an excellent new set of guidelines today called 15 days to slow the spread. I encourage everyone to read.Edited: 5:50 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Actually, it was Norway that not only implied it but urged its citizens to come home, especially if they are here in the Us. Also, please keep politics out of this. It’s a travel forum. Please don’t come down here, we need our supplies and our hospital for those of us who live here."
I just hope all understand that a few thousand dollars are not worth killing someone over. This will pass in time but no idea how many weeks. We do have reservations for June but if things are still bad then we will cancel.
"I agree Valentinesailor. Norway, having a much lower population than The United States, has almost as many cases as the U.S. They do have more COVID deaths than the US. My plan was to come to Key West in July but thankfully haven’t made any reservations yet. Just had to cancel work travel also but I’m actually relieved. Safety and health for everyone first."
Welcome to the Florida Keys...Now Go Home!!!As of today we do not have Covid 19 here and we don't want it...You can come down when it's all over...
"Update- Ohio has closed bars, restaurants, gyms, cancelled certain medical procedures, and out numbers are exploding. We have cancelled and rescheduled to May 30th. It sucks, but we will be safe, and we were able to rebook at a lower price and go for 8 days, versus 4!"
"I wouldn't say Ohio is exploding. Steps the governor is taking are helping to keep the numbers down. Many of these same steps will be in Monroe county this week, I suspect"
Steps KW should have taken days ago.
I’m hearing that the city will be closing the bars. An announcement is expected this afternoon.
Sloppy Joes closed until further notice. All live music at the Parrot cancelled until further notice. More to come....
"It's about time this island took it seriously.KW needs to follow the protocols of larger cities like NYC, Houston, Dallas, etc. You don't contain spread of something that's asymptomatic by allowing bars and eateries to remain open.Terribly irresponsible of our local govt to move this slow, but typical."
"Waiting for the call for hotels, these people need to go home."
"Yesterday I had a restaurant and bar owner look me in the face and say that it's business as usual in the Keys, CV isn't here and we should be welcoming the increased tourism. I asked about the recommendation of no more than 10 or 50 (depending on source) people gathering and he acted totally oblivious to the concept. Kept repeating the phrase, ""no cases in the Keys!!!"" Sadly, people genuinely believe that. Talked w friend who is a local bartender and people she's dealt with think this is a hoax, senior citizens are streaming into her bar and say how healthy they are. Drastic measures need to be taken, and many are in total denial."
Would love to know WHO not to support in future'The bars need closed by what ever it takes such as fines. Even if every tourist left in the next hour it will be weeks to know if anyone caught it and passed it on.
"I'm scheduled to arrive 4/22, really look(ed) forward to the trip but no way I see it happening. To those who say in Key West, or any major city, ""stay away, no cases here"" you are wrong - it's there, you just haven't tested the right people yet.Stay safe everyone. Be smart. It's only money you are losing."
"As of today at 5pm all bars and restaurants are closed except for takeout. Smathers Beach is closed and the Southernmost Buoy is blocked off. I saw trolleys running with lots of people on them today. No more sunset celebrations at Mallory Square for now either. You will be very bored!Edited: 9:18 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Hopefully that will be enough to get them to leave.
Just an update. Due to what’s going on in the world the resort has changed its policy & letting us choose other dates.
Did SWB finally close last night? I checked the webcam at 7pm and it was crowded and still serving.
"A lot of places are shut down as of today. All bars are closed for 30 days, no cruise ships allowed, beaches and the southern most point are closed. Mallory square is also closed."
"Now hearing that Fogarty’s, Caroline’s, waterfront brewery and SWB all stayed open last night despite the order to close."
Jack Flats and Lucy’s Retired Surfer Bar did the same thing. I will never patronize or recommend these places again.
From the live cam SWB at about 10 was empty and looked like crew was just cleaning up. This will all depend on licence and they risk the license if violating.Latest news from white house is this might take 18 months to stop the virus so could be huge impact on all of KW and the rest of the US
"Fogartys had limited its seating and widened the gap to 6 feet between tables it appears. Freshwater Dave’s Facebook page did a live walk down that block of Duval. Flying Monkey was closed. Lucy’s bar appeared closed, some limited seating. SWB appeared closed on their webcam at 11 when I looked. So what’s the rule with the restaurants? They can stay open if tables are far apart? In Ohio they shut down all in door restaurants and all bars."
"City of KW said no open restaurants for dine in. Take out and delivery only. I feel for everyone in the service industry right now. But the sooner everyone starts following the rules, the sooner (hopefully) we can put this behind us."
"Thanks Jon. Me too, I bartend in Ohio, it’s terrible everywhere but with tourism and the cost of living in Key West, it’s a real kick in the man parts to all of them I am sure. Yes, hope it passes quickly."
Just saw this picture https:/…727856a33c4d3298b70a60681c1e2bc8Kind of makes it real. :( Weird that they have covered the marker but I suppose its to keep people from taking pictures anyhow
That picture is priceless. Hope it sends clear message
Looks like SWB is closed.
Beaches Closed by the Order of Amity PD! ~~/)~~
Sorry wrong Island. ~~/)~~
"We were scheduled to arrive on March 28. Thankfully, our rental agency refunded our money for the condo. I assured them that we will return, hopefully in the fall. Stay safe everyone!"
"For anyone thinking we created a second account we did not. Cell phone forced me to sign on and without watching I created 2kwlovers. Now need to figure out how to remove it. HELP, seems the lack of CAPS allowed it.Edited: 5:18 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Glad to see TA fixed my mistake LOLWe were last in KW for NYE and miss it . Looks sad to see it so empty but it survived Irma so can survive this too :)
Clearwater is closing beaches for 2 weeks but not till Monday. Does that not spell greed for $$$$
"I’m in Key West right now and things are closing down. No bars or restaurants open past 5. Take out only. Just got back from snorkeling and they said it was their last trip.. Sunset sports, one of the big ones."
You could get in a once in a lifetime picture of the covered southern most point. Am sorry your vacation went further south than you planned.
"Hopefully visitors will get the message and go home.Edited: 9:56 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"For those people saying “tourists go home” we’re trying. And despite what you think, we did research whether we should come. We called the CDC and asked if it was safe to travel here and they assured us it was and told us to have a good time. I’ve been following this forum for a year since I started planning this trip. We’ve reached the age where we need to start going on our bucket list trips because we don’t know how many of them we’ll get. This was our first. I’ve been grateful for this forum for all the recommendations and answers to my questions. Things fell into place and we booked our hotels, flights, rental car and activities. We flew down on Sunday. The plan was to spend 2 nights in the upper Keys then head down to Key West for 4 nights. We enjoyed exploring Key Largo and Islamorada. By the time we drove down to KW yesterday, things had deteriorated and I spent the drive time trying to change and cancel flights, hotels etc. By then, I had seen so many posts on this forum and particularly this thread saying “Go home tourists, we don’t want you here.” After arriving, we had a drink and a meal before the bars and restaurants closed yesterday and found a few places open today but it was hard to enjoy it when all I could think of was that those people waiting on us we’re thinking, “go home, tourists.” We’re going.So, thank you all for the recommendations - this was shaping up to be an epic vacation, one we needed desperately after a rough year! We enjoyed the sunshine and the warmth and can check the Keys off our bucket list. Most of our activities were canceled, but that’s nothing in the grand scheme of things with all that is going on. Pretty sure we didn’t bring the virus with us as there are no known cases where we came from either, but honestly who knows.We wish the best for all in the Keys as we all navigate this new normal. Be kind and take care of each other."
"Sue, Sorry if some of these poste seemed rude. I think people here are very worried about our hospital capacity. This is a small town in spite of tons of visitors we have very limited ER facilities and only a handful of ventilators. I certainly agree that the CDC were unprepared and giving poor advise until only a few days ago. Everybody underestimated this. The testing in Florida has been minimal and almost non existent in The Keys. We current have 4 test results and about maybe 10 more pending. We keep telling everyone there are no confirmed cases, but almost everyone here knows people who are sick with the symptoms, and who’s doctors wanted tested, but were not able to get the tests. I know it’s hard to get home early and appreciate your understanding. Unfortunately some people don’t seem to understand the threat not only to themselves, but others. Duval Street was packed last night and visitors are still coming in spite of everything being closed.. Not only are we worried about our own residents, but would hate to be a vector to bringing the virus all over the world with people going home."
"Sue, sorry that is your impression. Our state depends on tourism and visitors like you. What is bothering me most personally and what I have been trying to advise against, is people who *were* aware of the new information and restrictions and still choose to come full well knowing the risks to others, especially those trying to plan brand new trips within in the past few days. Or people refusing to cancel with that knowledge."
"All bars and restaurants are closed on key west. Some restaurants offer take out and/or delivery. The largest water adventure company has closed as of today. Why anyone would visit right now is a mystery to me. Even traditional attractions, trolley tours and museums are closed."
"For those of us who are not financially impacted by the restaurants/bars and water adventure company closures and truly love the city of Key West the way I do: If you receive a check from the government, please consider giving the money to a restaurant or bar server who has served you well in the past or anyone who is in need during this time. Your income is not effected, theirs is. Just a thought. I know we will be happy to donate to a local server when we are able to get back to The Rock. In the meantime, stay safe and wash your damm hands!Edited: 11:34 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Sister Season Fund is an amazing local charity to donate to at this time. Its purpose is to assist hospitality workers in Key West get through difficult times. Typically it assists with rent and bills for people who can no longer work due to unforeseen and out of their control incidents in life. Accidents, cancer, etc. Not someone who drunkenly crashed their bike and broke their leg, lol. Not surprising that addendum needed to be added.I know money is tight, but if able to donate that is a fabulous cause to support that directly assists all the people that make our Key West experience so fabulous. People down here are really going to need some assistance."
"Has anyone stopped and said maybe we are freakin out just a bit too much? Why shut the economy down for a virus that few have? Also the odds of getting the virus and even dying from it are minuscule. If you look at the history of “pandemics” the plumber and garbage man have saved millions more than doctors and nurses. I’m not saying doctors don’t save lives, my wife is a doctor, but high quality infrastructure and proper hygiene saves more lives. That being said Key West holds a special place in my heart and hopefully things will be up and running in a month when we are expected to vacation. If so I expect to tip a much higher percentage than usual."
"Matt, since your wife is a dr, please thank her. Focusing on death rate is misleading - it’s about the rapid and often undetected rate of transmission and strain on limited resources all at once (hospital beds, PPE, ventilators, healthy staff remaining who haven’t been quarantined/infected eventually). Numbers in FL last week were around 30, we are 300+ in less than a week. The math is alarming."
I would reschedule in a month.
I agree Mattp2206! ~~/)~~
Latest rumor is that all hotels will close at 6pm on Sunday.
"Here ya go, Jonhttps:/…article241349851.html"
"To all of you who continue to doubt this seriousness of this virus while the rest of us stay in our homes, please do your research and think of the rest of the world that is not leaving their house.I am appalled by the photos I am seeing on Facebook of the selfish people jetting off on spring break. A week ago I was hoping to keep my KW trip, however as a responsible citizen we will of course be canceling. My family hasn't left our house since Sunday.SHUT IT DOWN. THIS IS NOT A JOKE, IT'S NOT BEING OVERBLOWN. IF YOU WANT TO TRAVEL BACK TO THIS BEAUTIFUL PARADISE, HELP SHUT DOWN THIS VIRUS BY DOING YOUR PART."

We were supposed to come down tomorrow. Cancelled our flights last night-was hoping the airline would do it for so we could get a refund but no. We are trying to get a refund of our rental house. Was told by rental company to put a claim through the insurance so we did that. Still waiting to hear. You would think it would be cut and dry if EVERYTHING is shut down but maybe they are just overwhelmed by requests. Rental Company did say if insurance denied then to call them and maybe they could work something out but it's just frustrating that we can't get that money back that we might need in the coming months.
Didn't the airline offer you an option to change your flight date? I thought all the major carriers were allowing free changes.Your rental is no longer permitted as of Sunday so I would persist with the rental company.
https:/…was only a matter of time and it happened
She's in Ocean Reef.
"Guys, this thing is moving at warp speed and the only thing we can do isolate, hope for the best, and pray we can get businesses opened back up.So many people in the hospitality industry have completely lost their jobs.Entire families no longer have a source of income.At the very least, we can treat each other well and if you aren't effected, throw some cash to a server or bartender you love."
The worst hit will be the workers in KW. They count heavy on tips and now that is almost zero. When this is over we will have a serious help problem as many will be forced to leave to find a job. Hopefully landlords will not evict them but nobody knows how long this will last. Very few have any savings to last more than a week. Thankfully we are set for life and retired but very few are. Will be extra kind to them when we return.
"Jim, most municipalities are suspending mortgage payments (based on need) and suspending all eviction processes for 90 days which will cover both landlord and renter.NYC did this and where they go, most will follow."
they have closed bars and restaurants there

Good God!
Outside the street's on fireIn a real death waltz .Between what's flesh and fantasyAnd the poets down hereDon't write nothin at allThey just stand back and let it all beAnd in the quick of the nightThey reach for their momentAnd try to make an honest standBut they wind up woundedNot even deadTonight in Jungle Land .
"The Keys have limited medical facilities and the nearest mainland facilities are likely to be very busy if not overwhelmed. Miami-Dade County is shutting down hotels until April 22. Shopping is mostly shut down. There's also curfews.Much farther north, the North Carolina Outer Banks are closed. Residents and property owners, only."
Yes and because of the limitation tourist need to stay away for now. If it hits KW they could be in serious danger. Stay home. KW needs tourist but not now. My guess is a couple months but could be far longer.
"""The worst hit will be the workers in KW. ""I don't think this is so true. KW has an airport and a port and when things start moving again KW will be busier than the rest of Monroe Co. KW gets the bulk of visitors for Monroe Co.As well as towns in FL (and the rest of the world) that don't rely on tourism and won't have the bump to pick them back up once this is over. I know places that will not be re-opening because they won't have that tourist boost or student boost as they are used to (when colleges are in session) as they are used to (such as Tallahassee). My favorite restaurant just said good night for good. And it's not just the restaurant workers. The sale reps for the food and liquor distributors etc etc"
Keys are now closed to non-residents as of tomorrow- March 22. Stay home.
"I trust that you have already heard and were able to alter your plans. Tomorrow 3/22 they are closing all Hotels and Resorts. Also, bars and restaurants haveclosed as of 5pm 3/17. Good luck and I hope you areable to get there soon..."
"Blue, who’s closing down?"
"Valentine - I was talking about one in Tallahassee that said they would not re-open if we were all shut down. However, they got such a response to that and an outpouring of support that they may be able to reopen. Barnaby's. I hope so!! I was in tears when I heard they likely wouldn't be opening again.That being said - it's going to be really tough for many. And for all others involved from our small-town paper that relies on the advertising to the liquor and food reps, local family owned fish wholesalers etc The small stores here.Edited: 2:14 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Blue, talking to our friends today who own 3 restaurants in kw, they are pooling tips and delivering but business is almost non existent so staff will ultimately be laid off. So sad."
"Bluewater. Yes KW will have tourists fast but likely few workers. Places were still hurting for workers after Irma even a few months ago. In short even if not evicted they need to eat. If I was one of them I would leave and go to places on mainland that have cheaper rent and hiring. Will they return remains to be seen. A landlord will get them evicted in time and that eviction is public records and will halt serious landlords that do background checks. Also note that landlords make up losses by raising rents and in some cases they will get out of rentals and sell the houses to the rich. That was already happening and this will add to it. We hope Patsy and Phil at our favorite place can help the staff stay working as they are a great staff,"
"Some places here already laid off much of the staff, my guess is they will do it to their KW properties too. Where I was just a bit ago - really slow to-go. But cars stopping by asking for in house dining. When told to go only one group argued that they were told by 'someone' that the place was open for inside dining. When asked if they wanted to place a to-go order they said no that they would go where they could sit down and get served.  (even after the situation was explained to them) The phone was ringing off the hook asking about in house dining. How is this message not getting through?!"
They are on vacation and totally clueless.
There are still a few tourists in Key West. It reminds of a midsummer day when I first moved here. I assume most will go home tomorrow and it will really be dead. Much of what happens here will be based on landlords willingness to be flexible and if the Federal Government gets meaningful aid to individual Americans instead of shoveling billions of no strings attached money to corporations.
They are not on forums like this and not watching the news. We seen something today that we have never seen before. At our local Sams club they had a security guard at the door. The place was busy but few items on shelf. All we could land is 40 pack of bottled water. Tampa is at near panic level. Wal marts are lowering hours as a corporate order. We are staying home as much as we can. Putting off routine dr visits as cuts both of our risks. Word of caution is handling cash as it is a carrier.
Why would you need water?
"I don’t know why people are buying bottled water. But we have the same situation here. I’m just trying to get some Aquafina at this point to top off my saltwater aquarium, but it’s been sold out for days. We haven’t left the house since last Thursday."
I too am confused about the water. Our normal method is 20 cases of water for hurricane season. We were shocked when we were down to 1 case to find it hard to buy. For us no big deal as would been starting to re stock for this year. Toilet paper I understand and as a good landlord will provide to our tenants if needed. People are scared and buying everything on shelf. Took us a week to find medication for our 4 year old grandson. We might be raising him for a bit as his school is shut down . It is rough but think positive that we will be OK.
So we just got an email that Kimpton hotels cancelled our reservation for May 30-June 7. Sad as it seems like they are expecting to be closed much longer than anticipated!
The old historic key west inns. Lighthouse Court is where we were staying.
https:/…My guess is not ready yet to open and nothing to do with virus
"I suggest everyone stop commenting on where we were and start sending money. It's your favorite place, support KW not only by visiting..Ask the locals where to send, I don't want to be accused of favoriting..."
"harboringviews, thanks for your post. In my opinion, Sister Season Fund is a great choice for people who want to help workforce employees. They step in and pay rent, utilities or other based needs. It’s a well run charity and is being swamped with request from out of work locals. http://www.sisterseason.com/Another great option is the SOS Foundation. They run a food pantry open to all and are offering boxed meals for children and the elderly. To help eliminate the spread of the virus, they are also doing drive through type service with a prepackaged selection of staples.The focus here is on keeping people fed and in their homes.Thank you."
I never understand the people that buy bottled water. Especially since everyone is staying at home why would you waste money on it?? I understand if there’s a natural disaster but for this.... cmon??
"This is a national disaster and people do not trust the government. Some are on wells that are not drinkable. Being nobody has answers on how long it will last they panic. Those with deep pockets or credit are stalking up on anything they can, Not all can or are staying at home here. Certain workers must continue or things will get worse. The very fact that a roll of TP can't be bought is self created but very real here. No idea how bad it is in other states but here it is in panic.Until cases start to drop this will continue. Very few will stop working.Son just came back from trip to Walmart. Basically very little food, no water , no TP.. The point is it was closed at 8:30 last night to restock."
"Again why would someone buy bottled water when they have tap water?? You are feeding into the fear. You do realize around 70,000 people die each year in the US to complications caused by the common cold. Just sayin."
Not to make light of the issue. but I just invisioned large military cargo planes dropping loads of toilet paper into open fields.On the serious side I wish all Floridians well and hope your supplies are replenished quickly. It seems our local Walmart’s are keeping up. I’ve never seen so many trucks in the supply area. Other grocers not so much. God bless the truck drivers.
Not everyone has water on tap. Some wells in Florida are nasty tasting or even unsafe to drink. At some point people will have as much water as they can store or run out of money. We can only produce so much TP and water. Even items like rice can't be bought at our local walmart.Issue here is the water will last for almost 2 years and don't think TP has a best bye date.The economy might go to s--- making TP demand even higher.While we are waiting for the next housing crash to buy up some more we now are rethinking the move if evictions become a problem. If that happens again very few will risk buying or have credit scores so low that they can't buy or even rent. Landlords that get hurt over this will evict and then sell them off.What we need very fast is a cure to at the least keep us alive.
Why is Tampa out of everything?Y'all are a lot closer to Lakeland's Publix distribution center than we are in South Florida and our stores are pretty well stocked. Not great but not bad at all.I don't get the TP issue at all.Please spread this link to any bartenders you know. It's a Bartender Emergency Assistance Program.https://www.usbgfoundation.org/beap
"Fred thank you so much for the info on the bartender relief. I am so thankful to be able to pass it on to my fellow bartenders. Some are living paycheck to paycheck and a few are even behind. Life happens. Thank you for sharing, it is much needed for some."
"""Didn't the airline offer you an option to change your flight date? I thought all the major carriers were allowing free changes.Your rental is no longer permitted as of Sunday so I would persist with the rental company.""@BriDsguise Yes, we can change our flight but since we don't have new dates yet we cancelled and then will be able to use the credit later.Still waiting to hear on the rental."

"""All four patients are isolated in their homes and expected to make full recovery"""
Yes and that is the best way to handle it. Only thing to do now is hope anyone they were with does not come down with it.This will come to an end but not till we run out of new cases.Even after we get KW back to zero the main land is at a very high number. Tampa is almost ready to be shut down very soon and likely by midnight today.I have trust that in time it will end but could be many weeks or even months. Then life can continue. At this point Monroe County needs stay shut down so that we don't risk new cases from tourists.
"Brl, being that Florida has a population of 22 million with 1600 cases and New Jersey is 3600 cases at 9 million people, I wouldn't call it that much of a hotbed.Also, 60% of new cases reported were those fleeing New York like that self centered moron on the Jet Blue flight who was diagnosed and got on the flight anyway. Jet Blue banned him for life."
"Now 8 and 2 hospitalized. The numbers will rise as we are currently testing. It’s going to be another two weeks after Friday and finally a road shutdown before we actually peak, maybe longer.Edited: 2:35 pm, March 25, 2020 "
Blue Paper reported US 1 closes on 27 th
Well that would be Friday right? The blue paper is a rag btw.
I have supported it for years because they will not hide news . But that is a personal issue and choice. Yes it is not always good for KW and has cost them money but saved Wisteria Island.I do think the keys need to take this action to get it under control. Only wish the action was faster.
"I didn’t know wisteria island was saved? For who, the criminals living on it ? It’s still in court, has nothing to do with the blue paper, that was a judge"
"Not everyone on Christmas Tree Island is a criminal. I have a few friends there. And, many of them had kayaks and bikes confiscated by KWPD today.Edited: 8:09 pm, March 25, 2020 "
The kayaks were at the seawall illegally. They can pick them up if they can prove ownership .
Most of them are not criminals. If you had read the Blue Paper you would know that they dug up the facts to keep it exactly as what it is and that is federal property. Hopefully it will remain as such forever. If anyone was a criminal that would be the last place to hide LOL.The people on it and living on the boats are simply poor and it is nasty to call them criminals.
"To get rid of negativity, thanks to whomever posted about sister season. My wife and I made a contribution today. Key West is our second home. Can't wait to return."
"Jim, I’ve lived here a long time, longer than the publisher of the blue rag. I know the people who paid for the island, I know the history and I know many of the people living on the island. I certainly don’t need some guy from Tampa giving me a history lesson. And yes, already donated to sister season. Namaste."
They bought it from the state of Florida and problem is the state never owned it. You do need a lesson on this one. When you buy property you best know who owns it first LOL. It simply was a matter of the year it was bought. Read up on it.The blue Paper has uncovered many things such as Mr Eimers murder that cost the city one million dollars. And no the city does not like them.
Umm is this thread about Coronavirus or about an island with a bunch of homeless people?

Yes 20 for all of the keys. 11 in just KW. I truly do hope that is just cases that finally showed up and that it is not actually more cases. Our hopes are high for KW as it is our second home and miss it. Am proud that they are fixing up KW while it is easy. Should look great when we return.
Good point
"I really have a hard time understanding how anyone could think there aren't going to be more cases? How, miraculously, could that be possible? Sadly the Keys will have similar growth in cases as every other location in the world. There is no cure, no vaccine nor immunity; most likely cases will double every 2-4 days."
"The Keys don't have five million people riding the subway (seven million if you include buses and regional rail) every day like NYC so the speed of the virus is unlikely to grow as exponentially as it is in the metropolitan area.Plus many of us are now entering two weeks of social distancing so there should be some positive effects from that.What is happening in NYC was unfortunately inevitable and I am counting my blessings I moved from there to a county with relatively few confirmed cases to date. The Keys and many other areas of Florida have the chance to learn from what happened elsewhere, adhere to social distancing and come out fairly unscathed.Stay healthy!"
"""Zerohedge"" .. And its cited here (#195) as if it was a real article in a credible, respectable publication?At first I stared … then I laughed … by now, I am concerned that the poster could actually believe in that nonsense and even worse, get others to do the same. Dangerous misinformation."
Sadly I must agree. Most are still walking around and not staying at home. It could result in a hundred cases easily within a week. At that point it will be out of control. Is no fix as outsiders are allowed to deliver or work and that will hinder this. Is no cure and you could get it recover and get it again. I don't think any ships will be docking for many months. How it will survive I do not know. I do wish them best of luck. Not sure if June will be even enough time to re open. For the locals not wanting tourists you now are getting a taste. Maybe that attitude will now change.
"Yes, Duval St will suffer big time-its not locals spending money there. No telling what businesses will be left after the dust settles...whenever that happens.....I guess tourism is a double-edged sword."
"Just trying to be positive but cautious. I'm hoping that by the end of this week we will see a drop in new cases on the east coast. Fingers crossed! Best advise, wash your hands and stop touching your faces! ~~/)~~"
"Salty, of course we spend money on Duval. Lots of restaurants, stores, art galleries etc in addition to the bars. Locals go to hogs breath too as an example. . We’ve been on Duval street this week almost everyday for takeout, biking, walking and just waving to our peeps. Keeping social distance of course. Obviously, locals alone cannot support Duval street but almost every store needs locals along with tourists to survive."
I just pray that number stays low and all recover. And we know locals that do support old town but that is not near enough to survive. The biggest thing to do is keepsafe. I am staying indoors here as I have pollen allergy so can't risk being outside long. It under normal times is OK with medication. We are both at high risk because of age and know it. Wish all survive but that will not happen. Seeing KW as a ghost town is sad.
"I just shudder when I think back to how incredibly slammed the island was right up until closure on the 17th. I think about how not a bar or restaurant in town does a full disinfectant clean weekly, let alone daily. All those people from CV hotspots. I think of all the bartenders, servers, bussers, hosts, etc who were touching plates, glasses and silverware, definitely not washing hands for 20 seconds each time. I can't see how it won't be doubly painful for hospitality workers, between losing their income and then when CV starts hitting them.The other keys which are less population dense should have much less community spread. The next few weeks in Key West are going to be very difficult."
"The other Keys were incredibly slammed too. Especially once Miami Beach and KW closed, all those kids came here and other open Keys as well as the large family groups that were already here, hotels were totally sold out. It was insane. We (the rest of Monroe Co) didn't close until several days later."
"The upper keys are always overrun with day trippers and they apparently are still coming down on boats from Miami, I’ve been told. I’m waiting for increased positive test results and hoping that’s not the case."
Defeats closing US 1. Once past MM 112 then who stops them from entering KW. Does not look good.
"Well the closure is keeping out a lot. Many people visiting Miami area don't have boats and don't know the waters to navigate down. A lot of convertible mustangs last week that looked like day trippers. The checkpoint turned around aprox 2000 people in a couple of days. That's something for sure. And it's not just KW, it's Monroe Co. Jesus."
"Sorry, yes I know it is all of the keys but we focus on KW because of it's size makes it scary. So in short the keys are open if someone comes by boat. That is not good because I would rather be homeless in KW than stuck in Miami.Edited: 1:44 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"Yes Jim, I’m sure homeless people from Miami are all arriving on their boats... enough with the gloom and doom. Key West has made it through hurricanes, total economic collapses and a tourism tsunami and survived. Yes, everyone is worried about the virus and our small healthcare capability, but it’s almost 2 weeks since St Patrick’s Day and hopefully the early steps we took will help.In the meanwhile, no one is going hungry. No one is being thrown out on the streets. The amount of charity and generosity in this town is amazing. Tourists are gone. Hotels, guesthouses, RV Parks and trainsient marinas are closed. Our streets are quiet. The water is beautiful and clear and dolphins have returned to the nearshore water. You see neighbors and friends getting fresh air while social distancing. Everyone asks how you’re doing and if you need any help. Conchs tell me this is the Key West they remember growing up in.  I’m not minimizing the health concern, but thanks to the action The City took, we are likely in much better shape than the rest of Florida. Our Governor seems to prefer blaming New Yorkers and China to closing beaches and hotels and ordering a lock down.Our economy will recover along with the rest of the Country whenever that happens. Key West was here long before any of us were born and it will be here after this pandemic.Edited: 3:49 am, March 31, 2020 "
I see that the Southernmost Point buoy is open again. ~~/)~~
"SDT, now that first comment was hysterical, thanks for the laugh.I absolutely agree with the rest of your post and I second it whole heartedly."

"Christopher, that’s a great video! Although lots less people around, that’s currently how we’re spending our time."
"Which bars are in the video?Edited: 8:32 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"And sadly, we have our first death. One of our own."
That's very sad news.
Yes very sad.
oh no …
"Sorry to see that news. Hoping people are distancing and keeping any additional infections away, and those that get the virus can recover."
i am so sorry to read this. Sending prayers and positive thoughts to all of the Keys.
Sadly they are not doing as much as they could. SWB is doing take out drinks and are not staying 6 feet away. The number is still very low but gaining. For many it is shared housing and homeless. Do hope they wake up before the numbers get out of control.
"Thank you mama duck, Jim, not connected to homeless, living situation or SWB. Please stop speculating about what’s going on. Local beloved family person."
It very much so is connected. SWB and likely many others not following the 6 foot rule. Just watch the live cam and you can see this. Even the street workers are not following safety. Not speculating just reading the facts of yesterday saying you now have 19 cases in KW. I do care about the people in KW and truly sorry about the death. You can either believe facts or try to hide them. This is a very serious problem and not a time to be getting nasty. If you have any updates please post them.
"Never mind, not going down that rabbit hole.For those of you who want accurate updates, I will post.Edited: 5:59 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"Look there are 175M people in the USA either working from home or not working right now. They need to get back to work, I don't know how they will do that but they will find a way in the next couple of weeks. Stay safe, healthy and happy!!!"
"@Valentine... please do keep posting. I love the Keys, I love KW, I want to know you all are okay xoxo"
Fascinating and incredulous reading this thread from many thousands of miles away. People here continuing to minimise the situation. Chris T. Almost unbelievable. You appear to have no concept of what’s about to hit you. Stay safe. Stay home. For months.As our First Minister said “you can repair the economy later but you can’t bring people back from the dead”
"Agreed about a lot of folks doing big talking with little to no real understanding of facts.Then again, they voted this kind of behavior into government... Why should we expect them to suddenly act like level-headed human beings in pandemic mode?"
That is all I was trying to point out and it upset a certain resident. The tourist are gone and some locals are acting like nothing applies to them. The number is growing every day so what they are doing is not following the law. That is normal for KW but this time it might cost them big time. Cases are growing every day. If they keep going at this rate they will soon not be able to handle it. It is not too late yet but they need to stop things that are clearly in violation or face the facts that the 19 cases will quickly be 100 or more. If not fixed you may never reopen KW.
At the end of the day poverty will kill more people than this virus. You can disagree with that but that’s a fact. Just think of all the businesses in key west that will not be able to reopen if this thing stretches to the summer.
LandAl and InConstantMotion1 .. Thank you!
valentinesailer - Thank you for your upbeat and accurate postings. Please keep those of us who love Key West and enjoy life up to date concerning your city. I know we won’t be visiting anytime soon but just purchased a new bathing suit for our next visit because this too shall pass.
"Thank you kat, no new cases posted today and I follow the county as a whole. Not just kw. We are all one human family."
"Valentinesailor . No new cases today you said. Am I getting something wrong ?Coronavirus update: Florida cases surpass 10,200 as hospitalizations continue to growEdited: 12:11 pm, April 04, 2020 "
"I wish people would limit this thread to updates about Key West. There are plenty of other venues to share your general beliefs about this virus.I would also add that if you are not here, you have NO IDEA what is happening here!! A few webcams In a bar or on Duval Street do not make you an expert and are not representative of the island.Like most places in America, some people here are not following guidelines. However the vast majority of residents are. As I said in an earlier post, our Mayor basically closed the entire town down almost two weeks ago. This included shutting all hotels which still remain open in most of Florida. She took decisive action long before the Governor did much of anything. Hopefully that will mean fewer cases and fewer deaths. Finally, if you want to help The bartenders, servers and other people you care about here, donate money to Sister Season Fund. If you own rental property here, consider giving your tenants a break. These actions will make a difference, unlike posting the same thing over and over again here."
"Landal, the county as in Monroe, not the state."
"Ah ok, thanks valentine Stay home. Stay safe.Edited: 12:23 pm, April 04, 2020 "
You too
"New positive, 27 yr old local girl( she’s ok with this post). Mild and at home. We are at 41."
No we are not there but the Blue Paper is and is free. They are keeping the facts up and concern is now also about KOTS.You can call it it a rag if you wish but they will keep you posted every day if you join it. Yes number is going up so the people may not be doing enough.And yes poverty might kill even more. As far as who can remain open is not the issue at this point. Will always be someone to fill an empty building. If they can afford to pay the back rent a Landlord is likely to work with them. https:/…
Can't you just give it a rest and let the locals update us for now?
"Our second death, a conch."
"Haven’t been posting much because SDT and Valentine have been doing an outstanding job updating with actual facts from in town, just want to echo what they have said. Thank you both."
"Valentine, I'm so sorry to hear this."
"Thanks xaos, these hit close to home, no travel, no tourist connection, just locals we all know and love. I’m hopeful we shut down in time for this to slow down but I think we should have been much more proactive,"
"And cruise mom, thanks for your previous post as well. How is your community faring?"
"Praying for you all. I wasn't lying when I posted about missing you all. I love this forum and the picture you all paint of KW. You truly are wonderful. I Please stay safe and healthy. @cruisemom...how is it there? My elderly aunt/uncle are in Titusville. I packed a bag full of papertowels/toilet paper to fly down there after an exhaustive search to get it delivered. But then realized people from NJ can not fly into Fl without being quarantined for 2 weeks. Went to plan c. Stay safe, its brutal out there"
"You could likely UPS the supplies they need.We are getting our updates by a local we trust. Keep in mind it takes days to know if your at risk. Stay at home as much as you can. A sip of warm water every 20 minutes is a good idea. We take our own temperature twice a day, and thankfully still under 98.6The unknown is can you get this twice. Am sure it hurts to have any friend die. So far nobody we know has caught it, fingers crossed."
"Valentine and Mamaduck, thank you both for asking about my area. We have been extremely lucky so far - there are no cases in Cape Canaveral (yet). There are 77 cases in Brevard County (3 in Titusville). Of the two towns closest to us, Cocoa Beach has 3 and Merritt Island has 5.We're lucky to be able to work from home so for the past 3 weeks, we've been nowhere except to grocery shop or go out on the beach occasionally to fish or walk. Our kids and grandsons live in Orlando and I do worry about them. Orange County has 689 cases as of this morning. :( I'm afraid we're in for a rough few weeks ahead - I hope you all stay safe and well."
And now there’s three.
"Thanks for the local KW updates (even when they are extremely sad). It's crazy up here in NJ. Our beaches and boardwalks are closed to discourage tourists, so we just walk the streets for fresh air and exercise. Although it was also nice enough for us to get a couple bike rides in too this weekend. Stay safe everyone!"
There's good news coming out of Italy and Spain this morning. New cases and deaths reported are lower. Hopefully that trend continues.
Valentine and SDT I'm so sorry.Please take care.
"Jtwiz, glad the weather is getting better. Fred, you too.Christopher, they were ahead of us by over a month, I’m hoping we don’t follow quite the trajectory of Europe. France right now appears to be getting worse.Edited: 12:24 pm, April 06, 2020 "
"Thank you Fred, I hope you are staying safe as well."
"My mistake, the third death was from Brandon Fl, not here in kw."
3 deaths. 51 positives. Currently
"First Key West scammer alert! Local bartender claiming she is CV positive. Not sure the scam, yet.A friend told me about this a couple days ago, was waiting to hear from my sources before posting, and they are rock solid.Sad and gross"
"Carol, was she asking for donations? I’m pretty sure I saw that unless it’s someone else. I don’t know her. But karma, you know."
Not yet. But I see it on the horizon.
Many scams right now. Just be careful of who your dealing with.Am holding hopes for the keys. Are seeing tourist that likely are south of 112 or produced false ID that is easily done. Are seeing tourist at southern most point. Who are questionable. Taking pictures is huge clue. Personally see no reason to want to be in KW now. The numbers are still low. Number of deaths in KW seems questionable. Wish them best of luck in numbers dropping but needs to remain closed till other cities become safe or this will just restart. At this point unsure of June.
"I have no idea what most of that means but if you're watching on the webcam, you're likely seeing locals at the buoy. Some of my friends who live in KW have recently posted pictures taken there. They've been out getting some fresh air on bike rides and have stopped to take pictures. Would they normally do that? No, but these are not normal times."
My thinking is they are from the upper keys and seldom visit KW. Some where actually hiding behind it when police cars stopped. The actions I seen were not typical of locals. Maybe they uncovered it too soon. Locals simply do not hug that sewer box as they know what it is. My concern is they are putting KW back in danger. We actually could gain entry as we are part owners of a rental property. For now doing our part in just staying home. Our hopes are most of us will survive. At this point it looks like many months not simply a few weeks. I hope I am wrong. After 46 years we know what a tourist look like.
"""Our hopes are most of us will survive"" What does this mean 2KWlovers?Edited: 9:31 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"@KWlovers - you can gain entry by being a part owner of a rental property? Seriously? That is huge no no. We have a second home at the NJ shore and one of the first executive orders issued by the gov. is we are all to remain in our primary residence. Be wise, stay home. As for your wish that "" most survive"" maybe you should rethink the way you word something before putting it down on the internet. My prayers are for all of us survive. Be well"
"Maybe don't drink and post.I don't know about Key West because I'm not there but there are A LOT of out of town plates, mostly Canadian, New York, and New Jersey here in South Florida.Maybe second home owners have fled from Covid heavy states to the keys.I hope not. We have the medical facilities to absorb the extra people. The keys do not."
"@Fred...do you think those are snowbirds that have not left especially Canadians? With the border closed to non-essential travel I wonder. My aunt/uncle left Florida as soon as it was announced the border was closing. My other aunt/uncle remained in Florida because it was announced in NH/Maine that snowbirds should stay where they are.Edited: 11:48 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"@mamaduck, I think it is a good mix of both."
"Carol, I’m curious why you are accusing someone of being a scammer? I know in fact a bartender that was positive. I personally know people they were in contact with them that the health department ordered into quarantine after contract with them. I’ve seen countless musicians and bartenders ask for online tips or donations to help out if you know them, that is not a scam in itself.Edited: 5:54 am, April 09, 2020 "
"Jim, I sure hope you are as generous to your tenants as you are with your forum posts.Carol, you have no idea who has COVID and who doesn’t. What do you hope to gain posting unfounded accusations and rumors about scams? You may actually be discouraging people from helping others in need.This was a thread intended to keep people who care updated about COVID 19 and its impact on Key West. Not to traffic in rumors, doomsday predictions or repeated posts talking about what you see on webcams. I live in Old Town. There are very few tourists here. There are cars with out of state plates here because we have many snowbirds and many are still here. They are not tourists. They live and own property here. Many locals are enjoying the town being tourist free and are taking pictures at the Southernmost Point or other areas of town that are usually packed with visitors. I took some photos there and in other areas of Old Town. Am I a tourist? How about focusing on the good things happening here? Restaurants are giving out hundreds of free meals and offering deep discounts to help out of work locals and trying to keep their employees working. There are people helping the elderly or at risk strangers with shopping or deliveries. There are people sewing masks for healthcare workers all day. Our locally owned hardware store donated $10,000 to Sister Season Fund. Some businesses are paying employees even though they are closed. Many guesthouses have hired people to paint and do minor repairs to spruce up the property, but more to allow people to earn some money and have something to do.You can keep focusing on a possible scam, or a group of people ignoring social distancing or whatever other negativity you can manage to find. I’ll focus on all the good and generous actions happening here and be thankful I’m here, still healthy and able to help others."
SFT.It's the same on all the forums I've been on lately.Some people just seem to get a kick out of posting misinformation and alarmist threads! What they will do when this is all over I don't know!
"302 is best post I have read in a while. Everyone stay positive, act smart, be kind...…."
"Xaos, I agree. If someone is collecting funds because they are out of work whether positive for covid or not, it’s none of my business. I do believe in karma and I don’t judge, we are generous to our community in the way we feel comfortable. I’m not a huge go fund me fan. SDT, try to ignore the guy from out of town who rambles on and on. Only those of us who live here know what’s going on. Watching live cams just means Too much time on his hands. I’m out riding my bike, working and trying to help those who need more than I do. That’s how I spend my day."
And that's why I love SDT!!
"Once again, I want to thank folks like SDT, Valentinesailor, xaos who live in KW and can give us accurate info on what's going on. As someone who was supposed to start her 17-day (sigh!) vacation yesterday in KW, I want to make sure that one of my favorite places in the whole world stays safe as possible. And to comment on what Fred and Mamaduck posted above about snowbirds...we know a bunch of people who own places in FL and decided to stay there throughout this crisis. At least they can enjoy the nice weather!"
"Thank you, SDT! I read more than I post and I appreciate your perspective and kindness. It gives me hope."
I have KW friends that have been posting photos of them in front of the buoy. I told them they were going to be accused of being a tourist. YUP! They are taking photos of themselves there without the crowds.
"Thank you for all of your updates! Truly appreciate you keeping those of us who are far away but have our hearts with KW.Stay safe and be well. SDT, hope your garden is doing well :-)"
"SDT""This was a thread intended to keep people who care updated about COVID 19 and its impact on Key West. Not to traffic in rumors, doomsday predictions or repeated posts talking about what you see on webcams.""While you mean good you need to look at the OP and it in no way suggested where this tread has traveled. Look at the date and they clearly never arrived. . The OP did not ask you to run this tread. If you wish to create one and post actual updates and conditions then please do so. Yes I have plenty of time to watch the live cams and they show and tell plenty of violations. And you too also clearly have plenty of free time. I am only after seeing FACTS."
"Oh the irony here.SDT, Xaos and Valentine, thank you for posting updates - I truly appreciate it. And Blue! You know what's going on as well and I love your insight. :)"
"I saw a article on a bar in Georgia that had money stapled all over like Willie T's and took it all down and donated to there employees. I wonder if Willie T's might follow suit along with other bars that have this in the keys, The Georgia bar had over 4,000 on the walls and other people caught wind of it and donated even more. Seems like a nice Gesture, I have bill or two on those walls, can't think of a better place for that bill to go. I will help replenish next trip down."
MY post was removed?? Because I thanked the locals who are the only ones who know what's going on?? Seriously?
We just saw that on the news. All for them handing it to the workers and will gladly help replace them. It is a nice way to help them out a bit.

Could someone local advise me what websites you trust for local news related to this topic? I would like to follow but being from out of state it is hard for me to learn which outlets are best to use. is there a Monroe County or Keys resource? What about greater Florida or southern Florida? Thanks
Floridadisaster.orgI tried to copy and paste but this has all the counties
This one toohttps:/…COVID-19-Coronavirus
"Great thank you. I'll keep the disaster one handy as I suspect that you use this during hurricane season too? Another thing I watch closely, even though I live far. Stay safe and take care there."
They both do hurricanes etc too. But the one I posted is Monroe co only.
Thank you. This is really helpful.
Last week I had a post removed for giving stats straight from the CDC website. I feel like if you are for reopening you get your posts removed on here.
"The Florida Keys, which have the fewest number of known COVID-19 cases in South Florida, did not report any additional confirmed cases of the disease on Tuesday. Instead, health officials decreased the number of confirmed cases from 79 to 78 after a contract tracing investigation determined that a person who fell ill with COVID-19 was not a Monroe County resident and did not have any connection to the Florida Keys. Per the Miami Herald"
"I don't want post a a link but there is good news regarding treatment for covid. So google ""Covid-19 treatment drug"" and read for yourself."
"I have been watching Sloppy Joes street cam this week out of curiosity. Sloppy's doors are shut and hardly a soul on the street. Seen an occasional bicycle, car or pedestrian walk by. Ghost Town"
"Streable, lower duval is indeed a ghost town but the rest of kw has become much more crowded as locals have gotten out, dined and the car traffic coming in and out of town has increased dramatically. Sloppys will open when the tourists come back."
I don't think a link will be removed unless self advertising. On such a subject I would hope TA would relax the rules. Did google it but did not really see any drug to help it.
