"Quote ""will begin urging any customers and visitors to local branch branches to put on facemasks starting May 17, alongside implementing other preventive measures.""Knowing how law-abiding the normal Egyptian citizen is, I don't see this as 'mandatory' as the headline states!!"
Just as good as the Facebook video where the store assistant cut a hole in it where her mouth was - It made it easier to breath.........
"How will they know if women wearing a niqab have a face mask on? Will the security ask them to uncover their faces to check if they have medical masks on? If they accept niqabs and scarves in lieu of proper masks then will any mask do? I saw a V for Vendetta type mask for 15LE today in New Nouzha and that is probably as ineffective as most of the dodgy masks that are being peddled in Cairo and then mostly incorrectly worn. The banks I saw today had dozens of customers waiting outside the door, the shorter banking hours just means bigger clusters of customers.Will the bank staff be wearing masks because if they do then they will need masks with a hole for their cigarettes, totally weird to see tellers smoking as they count the money."
Where masks by bank tellers and patrons is a good thing. Hopefully it is done to the appropriate standards and protects those it is intended to. Whether it happens as it should is up for debate. Bank robbers will love everyone wearing a mask.
"#4 wearing a niqab will be as ‘effective’ as most normal face masks in preventing a person with symptoms from spreading the virus, but only if the queue is less than two hours which is the time the material of any mask, other than specialised masks, becomes sufficiently damp as to pass organisms through freely."
