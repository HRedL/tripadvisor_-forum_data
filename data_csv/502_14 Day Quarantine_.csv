Is this still in affect for incoming visitors flying into Alaska? I have googled this and can’t find any recent information. We are set to arrive on June 26th.
"At the moment the 14 day quarantine is in effect. The policy will be re-evaluated around May 20: https:/…There is no way of knowing if it will be in effect on June 26. Even after the mandate has been lifted, if there is a surge of new cases, it could be reinstated."
Thank you for the update.

"They don't want the virus to travel along with you on your vacation and be spread all across Alaska. Even if you're healthy when you depart, it can be picked up on the plane or in the airport.So yes, they require (not want, require) people to self-quarantine for 14 days. No driving around and vising small towns, going on excursions, or even entering a grocery store."
"Heather, if you arrive in Alaska when the 14 day quarantine is in effect, yes you must quarantine in a hotel (or something similar) for 14 days. No, of course you're not allowed to rent a car and drive around when you're in quarantine. That defeats the whole purpose, which is to prevent travelers arriving in Alaska from exposing the people already there to COVID-19. Did you know that more than half of people who have that virus show NO symptoms, but are still capable of infecting others? And that the current tests for the virus have a 10% to 30% rate of giving false negative results--meaning patients are told they do not have the virus when they actually do?"
"Alaska's quarantine requirement for people coming from out of state is not much different than quarantines imposed in other parts of the world. Alaska currently has only 45 active COVID-19 cases with no new cases reported yesterday ( reference …alaska.gov/dph/…default.aspx ) . As a resident, I would like to see that trend continue down to zero. A single commercial flight with one or two asymptomatic passengers on it could radically change current figures a couple of weeks later. I had plans to visit Spain and Portugal this summer and that likely isn't going to happen. So, I have shifted focus to my home state to rediscover old favorite locations and discover new ones. It's a big, beautiful, interesting world out there, regardless of whether one is checking the box on a bucket list. When checking the box means someone potentially ends of kicking the bucket, the list just isn't that important.Edited: 4:54 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"The required quarantine details are in Health Mandate #10: https://covid19.alaska.gov/health-mandates/Perhaps because of this and other mandates, Alaska has only 45 active cases and ten deaths. Oklahoma's numbers are at least two orders of magnitude higher with a 4% jump since yesterday on the number of cases, while having only five to six times the population than Alaska.I like how my state officials have managed the crisis so far when I see comparative numbers like that."
"""This doesn’t make sense to me.""Even more of a reason for you not to visit us at this time."
"As of today I just found out that the travel ban will be lifted as of Friday, June 5. However you have to have a COVID test within 72 hours of your flight to Alaska. In our state I believe that it takes three days to get the result back so I don't see that working for us unless I can find a test that will give same day results. You can get a test when you land at an Alaskan airport but they warn that this could cause delays getting out of the airport. The state strongly suggests having the test results with you when you board the plane.Edited: 12:19 am, May 30, 2020 "
I am pretty sure in my state that you cannot get a test unless you have symptoms. I have also heard too that it takes around 5 days for the results.
"I think this is great, I was hoping Alaska was going to do something like this. I am actually guessing this will be the norm for travel until a vaccine is available, and even then, proof of that might be required.I think some places in my city are offering a COVID test without symptoms. I hope by August they become more readily available. It's nice that Alaksa will test us also, but I dont want to use up one of their tests if I dont have to."
"Not to mention that if someone gets to Anchorage airport and tests positive....! Better to find out before you leave home.For people who aren't sure if they can test locally, contact either your doctor or other health professional to explain the situation. Even if they don't normally test non-symtomatic people, they hopefully will make exceptions for those planning to travel. They might ask for proof of your airline reservation before actually doing the test."
This still leaves the issue that results may not get back for 3+ days.
"I work at a hospital, our results come back within 8 hours. My boyfriend also works at a hospital, their turn around is 1 day, You may need to call around, faster tests are out there."
"At this time, typical results are 48-72 hours. Results can be quick for a patient who needs results in order to receive a needed procedure. However, travel would not be considered a priority and would fall into that 48 - 72 hours."
"That may be true for your city, but that is not the case everywhere."
"As per #16, in my town, the result turn around time range from 5 hours to 5 days depends on the medical settings and the labs they use. Though overall speed has shortened since March, it's something each traveler has to navigate."
"Another question to ponder is what if your flight is delayed and it takes you outside of your 72 hour window.Edited: 2:35 pm, May 31, 2020 "
Post #12...I’m with MM on being concerned about showing up at ANC and testing positive. I can’t imagine that the airline is going to want you on the next flight home... To me it looks like a case of quarantine until a negative test. Where does the person go? Is that traveler ready to pay for a quarantine until they are welcome back on a flight?
Kurt--I've worried about the flight delay too. I'd be inclined to try to get my test right at the 72 hour before boarding mark to give maximum time to get results back but so many potentials for delays. Hopefully we'll get more info tomorrow that will clarify some of this.
"Great point, Scott. You get to Alaska and test positive at the airport you’re going to have a lot of problems. This whole thing is a big gamble for travelers."
Perfect reason to do the test before leaving home.
Yes. I just hope I can arrange the test within the window. And even I test positive here I still might be out some money so close to my intended arrival.
"We will follow the rules but does the governor not realize there is the 72 hours after the test, the mingling through the Atlanta airport for us, flying on the plane to Seattle, mingling through another airport, and getting on another plane to BBC Fairbanks? Just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.Edited: 7:14 pm, May 31, 2020 "
Don’t know what that bbc is so ignore.
I fly out of ATL too. I used to fly out of a BHM a good bit but that’s been several years.
"John, We would rather drive 2 hours to Atlanta and get on a direct flight or on a very early flight to get closer to our designation if there is a layover. Also, we have learned if there are any problems, it Is much easier to resolve in Atlanta than in Birmingham."
Yeah. I’m only an hour away from ATL now.
Just got a notification that the governor is doing a press tonight on the number of spikes. Not good news!
"I'm supposed to travel to Barrow/Anchorage with a friend in mid-July. Looks like we won't know until literally two or three days before our flight leaves whether or not we're going. As soon as one hurdle is cleared, another pops up. The problem we're encountering is not being able to find anywhere that does testing with immediate results anywhere around us. Either the results take two weeks or more, or no one will do them unless you have symptoms already. I guess we could take our chances and see if they can test us at the airport before we leave, but that's a gamble I'm not sure I want to take. Maybe testing will be a little more accessible as time to our trip gets closer."
Would you mind updating us on any changes? Are there any hotspots in AK?
Updates...Various news sources are searchable. Look forADN (newspaper)KTUU (NBC tv)KTVA (CBS tv)
Do you have to have the swab test or the blood test done?
"""Do you have to have the swab test or the blood test done?""- no idea what test(s) will be acceptable. In fact they haven't even published the precise details/rules/law that will come into place on June 6. - as of now all we really have is the continuation/extension of the 'June 2' rules until the end of June 5- ""***This mandate is extended to June 6, 2020***""see the May 29 update to mandate #10 at: https://covid19.alaska.gov/health-mandates/With our huge 'spike' yesterday I'm betting that's why we don't see what happens after June 5th in an official rule/mandate yet.I think we all want some freedom and economic relief; but at what price will it be; and politicians bear the burden of those decisions."
"Yeah, I didn't see anything in the articles I read but I think one test shows if you currently have it and one shows of you ever had it"
I am pretty sure the blood test is for antibodies. I had it and tested negative-meaning I have never had the virus and have no antibodies. The test for Covid is a swab.
"I'm a clinical microbiologist, performing covid PCR testing (nasal swabs) at a local hospital. Im sure the entry requirement is for the nasal PCR tests, since it detects current disease. The blood antibody test is to pick up past infection/possible immunity. Its an interesting dilemma to prove a neg test within 72 hrs of flight. As others said, we only test symptomatic, pre-op, or those being discharged back to nursing home. The test takes 50 minutes, meaning same day turn-around-time (TAT). More tests (the asymptomatic one's) are sent to an outside lab, and the TAT is usually 2-3 days. I doubt our lab would do a same-day test for someone travelling.The need for a test will discourage travel this year. I totally understand and agree with Alaska's platform to keep COVID out! The #s there have been remarkably low!!I'm coming for a second time in July 2021, this should all be worked out by then."
"From Alaska Health and Social Services Facebook PageTravelers, changes are afoot! Are you traveling to Alaska soon or interested in visiting our great state? Beginning at 12 a.m. on Saturday, June 6, proof of a negative result on a qualifying COVID-19 test obtained before arriving in Alaska allows anyone entering our state (residents, visitors and workers) to get started on their vacation or business right away without a 14-day quarantine. This must be a PCR test, not an antibody or serology test. If you can’t get tested before traveling, some testing will be available at airports but travelers must self-quarantine until negative test results come back. If you choose not to be tested, you’ll need to go through the full 14-day quarantine. Enjoy Alaska, but leave the virus at home. Watch covid19.alaska.gov for more details as they're finalized."
"@ post 40....great, clear info. But no mention of 72 hours?"
"“ #41 of 41 ·@ post 40....great, clear info. But no mention of 72 hours?”- actually... still no actual mandate/law/rule yet.The state ‘mandate’ web site says two things:- “ ***This mandate is extended to June 5, 2020***” (this refers to the 14 day quarantine), and- “ Mandate 010: Interstate & International TravelAdditional information about updates for the mandatory self-quarantine order for international and interstate travelers will be released later this week. Travelers should continue to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to Alaska.”So... the test mandate has not been published."
"For those of us scheduled to arrive on June 6, this lack of clarity and pushing decisions to later is a problem! For now, we are working on getting tested tomorrow (we can't find any place that will test our child in the time-frame, only adults)."
"Ferg...(1) How old is your child? ... better question might be... Is your child in grade school? I'd bet your school district has a contact that might help.(2) June 6th arrival from out of state!!! I'm happy you are trying for yourself, but please try and change your dates. I would prefer we minimize the opportunity for the disease to spread here. We already have two things going on; (1) seasonal seafood workers (testing positive after quarantining), and (2) a recent spike in a long-care facilities in ANC. We still don't know nearly enough about the latency of Covid. Be sure our medical resources will be being used.Edited: 12:48 pm, June 02, 2020 "
"She is a freshman in high school. We started booking this trip back in August. Thus far, everything is still a go that we had previously booked. We will be tested, we will wear masks, we are staying in a friend's RV, we are bringing hand sanitizer and wipes. We will social distance. We will frequently just be hiking on our own. We will be very conscientious about those around us and wanting to be safe. If something changes between now and Saturday with our personal health or with the AK government, we will cancel and try again in some future year. Unfortunately, these dates are the only dates we can make it work this year, unless it ends up not working."
"If you do go, report back to let us know how it went. Good luck!"
"Yes, Ferg--please report back! I had not even thought about the fact it might be difficult to get my teens tested. Hoping you're able to make it all work!"
https://covid19.alaska.gov/
"I just spoke to someone at the governor's office. The number is 907-451-2920 if you want more information. The woman I spoke to told me they will be releasing more information on Friday. I explained the issue that so many of us are having with being able to get a text result back within the 72 hour time frame. I was able to set up a quick test but I don't know if they will be an acceptable test. Otherwise, I don't know how to proceed. Ferg, I don't know if this is helpful to you with your tight timeframe. We are set to fly out on June 15."
"Thank you! My wife and I are getting tested tomorrow at Walgreens and a local hospital (with a little string pulling) has agreed to provide a test for my daughter. We should all have our results back by Thursday, Friday at the latest. So unless AK changes things dramatically on Friday, we should be good to go on Saturday (assuming the tests are negative, of course)."
"Ferg...lots of good luck to you. Leaving for a vacation is a tense time already, but with all this added tension...good luck"
Good deal! Please let us know how everything goes!
Our numbers have been 'booming' the last 3-4 days. Maybe you'll actually bring good/healthy bugs with you!!!
"We are driving an RV from the lower 48 to Fairbanks. We have had RV parks reserved since December. My question is how do we get a test before we leave home when it will take us more than 72 hours to drive there? Directly from the Anchorage News ""If a traveler is not able to get test results that quickly but can get tested and receive negative results within five days of their departure, they will be asked to take a second test at the airport when they land in Alaska and minimize their interactions with others until those results come back."" 5 days? I am so confused. Is there an airport near Alaska Highway 2 after we cross the border that we could get a second test?Please clarify for RV'ers."
"Yankedog, the Canadian border is closed to non-essential traffic. I suggest you fly to Anchorage and rent an RV there. That will also enable you to get the coronavirus test prior to your flight."
"The way it looks to me, if you choose to get tested in Alaska, you must wait for your (negative) result, which likely will be in 72 hrs (or less) to begin your vacation. If you refuse testing, you'll wait 14 days to begin your fun."
After calling several testing locations I found a local Urgent Care that said they will do COVID testing without symptoms. They also said they test adults and children. Right now the average turn around time for receiving results is 48 hours. Of course that could change quickly. We have a trip planned for the fist week of July. Hopefully we will still be able to go!
I have been trying to figure out if there is any trip insurance that would cover you if you can't get the results in time before you board the plane. Is there any insurance worth buying? I was just going to insure our AirBnb since our plane tickets can be changed prior to us departing. I have never purchased insurance before in my life for trips. We are in B'ham Al and right now there is a place that gets results quickly without symptoms but that too could change. We are supposed to go July 23rd. Any thoughts?
Just landed in Anchorage last night. Ordered my Covid test kit from LabCorp.com (insurance paid). No symptoms but checked that I had been in a crowd. Turn around time 24 hours. Printed the results and brought with me. There is an online form that you can fill out as you’re deboarding plane at: https://app.kelvin.care/. Nice people in hazmat suits check you in. It’s easy and painless. And it’s beautiful here!
"Not seeing a self test covid test at LabCorp. Could you post a link to that , please?"
If you go to LabCorp.com scroll down to the purple section that says something about “Home Collection Kit”
Perhaps a better link:https:/…covid-19-test
Many thanks!
"My family is actually on our flight to Anchorage. I have printed out the declaration page for each of us and we all took a test within 72 hours of takeoff. Our flight attendant just told us that they are not accepting the paper declarations, they want it filled out online and you present a QR code when we land. Once we get there and go through the process, I will update. Just when you think you are prepared!Edited: 8:32 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Be aware that as of Monday there is a mandatory mask requirement in all public indoor spaces. I would expect many other cities/towns/villages will follow suit due to the growth in new Covid 19 cases and would not be surprised if the mandate becomes statewide. It will help others if you have a moment to post about your experience when you arrive regarding the forms/testing etc. Thanks!Edited: 9:58 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"When you fly into Anchorage, you need to go to this website:App.kelvin.care. It will allow you to complete the online declaration form. Upon completion, you will be emailed from them and it gives you a QR code. Each family member needs to do this on a different email. When you get off the plane, you are taken to a table and they scan your QR code and you show them your negative test results. I am not sure what happened to people without a current COVID test or those who had not completed the online form. For us, we were done in under five minutes. He said Alaska is offering a free follow up test in 7-14 at the airport. All this to say, if you have a test within 72 hours and fill out the online declaration page before you land, it is pretty easy. We are so excited to be here!"
Thanks for the info and please have a great but safe time!
Heads to anyone trying to use LabCorp for testing. They only provide test to people 18 or older. We have two minors in our group and birthdays later than 2002 are not an option. Thanks
"For the labcorp at home test, is everyone saying they've been exposed? Saying that I have not been excludes me from the test."
"When I did a test on the website I said yes to whether I had a cough. They did not ask how often I cough. Don't we all cough occasionally? That was enough to allow me to get the covid-19 test. I just did it to see the process. I don't need a covid-19 test at this point. Didn't go through to actually schedule the appointment.Edited: 4:16 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"I'm thinking about doing the LabCorp thing for a trip in September when I will be 'out of state for ....yep, you guessed it, about 80 hours and over a weekend so getting a test will be difficult and I don't want to quarantine when I return. Would it work to do the LabCorp test the day I leave and get an email result before I land in Anchorage...what do you all think? The test at the airport and quarantine until the results come back is a 72 hours or thereabouts isolation, right? It's manageable but not the best. Oh, just happened to have a bit of a brain action....I'm thnking I will get some of those disposable plastic rain ponchos and put them on in the airport and on the plane...trying to protect clothins as trip is so fast laundry probably not possible....if I were smart I'd give a pass on this trip but.....Stay safe and stay healthy!"
"The test currently has to be done within 72 hours, not 80, to be able to just walk of the plane. Though if you get it within 5 days, you'd have to take an airport test upon return then ""minimize interactions"" pending the result. Would that work for you?Current turnaround for the airport test averages 2 to 4 days, though some are faster and some are slower. The last stated ""goal"" I read was a 2 day turnaround, but no time listed for when they hope to do that.Of course, rules could be different by September...."
"Has anyone actually taken the LabCorp home test kit? Do you timestamp when you do the swab before sending it back? Is it the honor system? If they don't timestamp, how does that work for being within 72 hours? My trip is coming up July 26, which is a Sunday. I think I'm gonna try my best to test 5 days before and then fail safe with the home kit at the 72 hour mark. However, if there's no timestamp for when the swab was taken there's no point for the home kit...if a tree falls in the woods and all that jazz."
Maybe someone who's done the LabCorp test could let us know how they indicate time and date? I just read that it's within 72 hours of the start of the trip to Alaska and I'll fall within 72 hours if that is correct as my first flight back leaves at the 65 hour mark. Thinking now I could do LabCorp. which is returned by FedEx overnight so I'd drop it at Fed Ex on the way to the terminal then just hope the results are back in time for arrival back here. I hope everyone has a great 4th weekend with safe activities and good health thereafter.
"Hi,it is Marbe2 from the east coast...lng lst Switzerland contributer who just got completely disgusted with the lady witch from Switzerland thinking she owned the Swiss website.

"How was your experience so far? My wife and I plan to arrive soon, as well. Visiting my son in the military."
"I just want to pop in here and answer my own question (and help others if you go this route for testing) regarding LabCorp home test time stamp. When you register your kit, you basically set the time on the site when the sample was taken. As for time, I ordered it on the 14th, received it on the 15th (missed the home delivery so picked up from FedEx office), registered, took the sample, put in FedEx dropbox on the 16th. Now just waiting for them to receive and process."
"Solo, their website says results are taking 4-6 days. When are you leaving?"
"My depart date isn’t til the 26th. I did the home test as a sort of a dry run to see how long it will take and also to make sure I’m covid free. I am locked down hard until next week. I don’t want any surprises. I plan on taking another test 5 days before and another 72 hours before. Hopefully one or the other will give me a result at least a day or two after landing.Edited: 10:48 am, July 17, 2020 "
"Does Alaska honor the ""Quick Test"" or does it have to be a LabCorp mail away test? We have ""Quick Testing"" at Go Health providers here in Vancouver WA and they have MUCH more liberal allowance for testing. It's basically impossible to get tested without active symptoms here these days.Thanks."
"From https://covid19.alaska.gov/faq/""Alaska accepts only molecular-based tests such as the PCR tests – antibody/serology tests are not accepted.""Alaska accepts results from FDA-approved home self-test swab kits. (Pixel/Everlywell/Vault/Picture Genetics)""A molecular-based SARS-CoV2 test is any of a number of tests that detect the presence of viral RNA (genes), such as reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR, e.g. Cepheid GeneXpert, KIngFisher System, ABI 7500 system), Transcription Mediated Amplification (TMA, e.g. the Hologic Panther system), and Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification (e.g. Abbott ID-NOW).""Edited: 3:26 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"Test result timing...I hope everyone is recognizing that the amount of time it takes to get a test result is not guaranteed by any lab. The time it takes results is getting longer. The time for non-medically necessary is taking even longer.- more people are testing- the processing of the test (to get a result) is taking longer because more and more people are getting tested.- it is very important that the labs have a system in place for the priority they use in processing (e.g. emergency surgery before lessor (but still important) medical issues, before this before that). Testing for the purpose of a vacation holds virtually no importance.- so... if/when someone is saying 2 to 3 days.... that's a big maybeI hope those of you that are taking the test for purpose of travel are weighing the strain you are putting on the medical system."
I did the labcorp test. To give a recap of dates to give you an idea of turnaround. Time for you may vary so take this with a grain of salt.Ordered on jul 14Received Jul 15 Took sample July 16 and returned overnight FedEx.They received on Fri July 17.SatSunMonTuesGot results yesterday at noon July 22 (negative).I just took another test by a concierge house call type service that supposedly has a fast turnaround bc they use a local lab. 72 hours before I hop on the plane so keeping fingers crossed.
