I’ve tried to contact Travel2be through their webpage ‘contact service’ to get refund for my family flights due to Corona Virus. It’s been 2 weeks but there is no answer at all. How can I contact them? Is there anybody who got refund from them?

"Travel2Be gives appalling service in normal times. Right now, its office will be in meltdown, and I would not expect a fast response."
