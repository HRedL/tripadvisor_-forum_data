"https:/…""British deal ruled outSpain receives many visitors from the United Kingdom as well as from Germany. But while tourists from Germany will be allowed to visit the Balearic Islands from June 15, this option will not be available to Britain. “We are in a similar epidemiological situation as Germany but that is not the case with the United Kingdom,” said Iago Negueruela, the head of the Balearics tourism department. “What’s more, with Germany we are negotiating within EU conditions and the Schengen zone, which is not the case with the United Kingdom.”Negueruela, however, did say that talks with UK tour operators and authorities were underway to enable the arrival of British tourists as soon as possible.""No surprise there!This part is interesting...“What’s more, with Germany we are negotiating within EU conditions and the Schengen zone, which is not the case with the United Kingdom.”Thanks Brexit! :-("
"Cant blame them, our death rate etc is still high, why would they fling their borders open to us?Besides that the FCO are still advising no travel so any travel insurance would be voided....and are there any flights actually going out anyway???"
Brexit has nothing to do with us not being a part of the Schengen zone.
"Ditto #2, the uk has never ever been part of the schengen area.Thought the early german(6000) travellers were part of a balearic pilot scheme to see how safely it can be done.Spanish quarantine will still be running then and they have been excluded from this.Maybe the uk should outsource the statistics to whoever is doing it in spain, then we would look ok.Atb steve.Edited: 4:21 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"56 coronavirus deaths recorded in spain last week , overall tally went up by 9.Figures start looking good when you ignore them and don't count them."
"If Spain does not allow British tourists soon, they will face the biggest recession the country has seen for years, the unemployment will sky high. They will take years to recover. They will need to find a solution quickly, otherwise its a disaster for them. They need the British, more than we need them. Plenty of other countries willing to take our millions."

".UK sent nearly 20 million tourists last year to Spain, Germany 12 ir 13 million. Far and away the largest contingent.They need UK tourism."
Testing in the U.K. now the highest in Europe and 10% of the population now tested.By the end of the month should have regional information showing where the positive cases are.
Spain doesn’t just rely on tourists from Germany and the UK. Figures show there were around 11m visitors from France. There are also large numbers (over 2-3m) of visitors from other EU countries. Unfortunately we may have to get used to being told that our Government’s poor handling of Covid 19 and Brexit supporters’ rejection of the EU means we’re at the back of the queue for a lot of things.
My understanding is that most EU countries only include people who die because of Covid19 whereas the UK report all deaths where Covid19 is on the death certificate. Prime example - a person I know died of cancer in hospital very recently but the day before they died they tested +ve for Covid19 for the first time and hadn't any symptoms at that time.. The death certificate stated Cancer of bowel was the cause of death and Covid19 was listed 5th .
"The number of deaths is still a very minute percentage even of those infected let alone across the population as a whole. But no government wants to be held responsible for 'needless' deaths of its citizens. Thus the reluctance to open borders and increase the possibility.The new normal will mean the almost complete end of tourist travel all the time there is one single case of this particular infection. Then a few months grace and along will come the next one.Get used to it, people. No more summer sunshine holidays on the Costas.Edited: 4:51 am, June 13, 2020 "
"Countries will simply come to terms with it and shield the vulnerable. You can already see the tensions between collapsing economies and behavioural restrictions. We said weeks ago there was no way Spain would still have national travel restrictions by San Juan - oh look, they’re being lifted just in time!"
"@ #5 This government doesnt care about that, thats more than clear.Many tourists booked already Greece, Italy, Portugal etc.What Greece became in 2009 will Spain become in 2020.I have GF overthere otherwise i would say: Sorry Spain, i will go somewhere else."
"I think for most people excluding the elderly and those with pre existing medical conditions, a normal holiday routine will be in place certainly by next year.I went out for the first time in 14 weeks this week as my hospital treatment restarted.I had some concern hospital staff not wearing masks, however, on my second visit 48 hours later I was much more relaxed and I am sure on Monday I will walk in as normal.We need to get our confidence back, with my age and medical condition in the most at risk category, I still have not given up our Spanish October break, not sure about flying, but by road very likely, with my children doing the bulk of the driving and then flying home and back again for the return. Just have to use the channel tunnel instead of the ferry, fortunately my daughter's favourite route to Spain"
"Ryanair and Easyjet have cancelled most flights to Spain from the UK until 15th July. While nothing is written in stone yet, it appears from mid July most people from the UK will be allowed to have a holiday in Spain if they so wish and without most restrictions (wearing of face masks and self-distancing will probably be obligatory).To quell fears that Spain needs tourists no matter what is unfair. Spain needs tourists (like every other country) but not at the expense of more Coronavirus deaths. I'm not going to get into any dispute regard Covid-19 deaths as this is not a competition between countries and even one Covid-19 death is one death too many. Furthermore, I wish the ""untruth-tellers"" would keep their untruths to themselves"
"At#15 , what untruths do you refer to?"
"Leprosy, where have you seen that Easyjet have cancelled most UK flights to Spain until 15th July? I have a flight booked from Manchester to Jerez on 5th July and as of 13.30 on 13th June it has not been cancelled."
"Same with ryanair, ""availability""into early july."
"Grant Shapps dropped a heavy hint at yesterday press conference that he expected to announce by the 29th June when the present 14 day isolation regulations come up for renewal that it was expected announcement about air bridges will take place.Add to the fact the Department of Transport on Tuesday supplied to all airlines the new guidelines for air travel once limited flying is allowed, there is now a 3 week window for airlines to prepare, even more if they wait until the 15th July.For a change Michael O'Leary should be happy as the measures are designed to make boarding and embarkation as swift as possible, music to an airline boss."
"I cannot remember a time that I have ever agreed with anything that Mr O'Leary has ever said...until now. The government are advising that we now put our bags in the hold rather than the overhead lockers - O'Leary has pointed out how many people handle those bags until they arrive at the destination, I believe it was 8.The airlines are ""promising"" to disinfect aircraft after every flight or at least over night - for me it makes better safer sense to use the overhead locker, clean hands, job done.....rather than a bag going on the filthy automatic belts into the filthy hold & being handled by numerous people on it's route. I despair that our government has lost the plot & am amazed that I actually agree with O'Leary!"
"It wasn't the UK government that came up with the policy of little or no cabin bags, it's EASA guidance"
"I would rather have my hand luggage with me in cabin :-)) xEdited: 5:11 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"https:/… https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/ju…https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/12…Rosebush WM, me too, I really like having have luggage at my destination!The reasoning behind using the hold rather than overhead lockers is just plain bonkers....in my opinion."
EASA guidance https:/…20passengers_final.pdf
Thanks @Ian for posting the Airport protocol Interesting to read the thoughts behind no hand baggage through the airport . Whilst I do prefer hand baggage myself it makes sense that bringing bags which will increase the time of security checks and close proximity to others would be reduced . Also mention that the trays used to pass hand baggage through the scanners are a source of contamination from respiratory infections and this would be hugely worrying if you think how many times they are used in a day . They simply could not be effectively cleaned We shall see how this goes
"The reasoning is quite straightforward to anybody who thinks beyond their own selfish preferences - people in the cabin huffing and puffing with hand luggage into and out of the overhead lockers creates much greater risk. Not to mention the scramble to retrieve them the moment the plane has landed. Anybody who thinks Michael O’Leary has your interests at heart rather than his own really, really hasn’t been following the plot."
"^^ I couldn't agree more - if they think they can maintain safety in the aircraft they are mistaken. Even if you have to put your hand up to go to the loo you still have to walk down the aisle within a metre or less of other people every row you pass.It's fine for them to say ""wear a mask if you're unable to maintain social distancing"" - well, if that was the answer why were told at the beginning they were not effective, and also why can we not all come out of lockdown now as long as we all wear masks/face coverings??You won't get me on a plane until next year i'm afraid or at least until the risk is very minimal, but sadly many people would rather have their two weeks of sun than be concerned with the greater risk at large - and yes, people like Mr O'leary are spreading the misinformation that... ""everything will be OK on our aircraft"" pffft"
"At #27 whats so special about next year?The holy grail of vaccine, or drugs to treat the worst effects?That may never happen, next year or in ten years, so everyone else sits on the sofa for all eternity because you yourself don't want to travel?At some stage everyone has to get moving forward and manage the risks out there for themselves and others, travel is just one such aspect of this.Good luck with next year, though maybe the present problems may persist even then.Atb steve"
"Sánchez has said international quarantine is fully over from 1st July - coastal Spain needs its economy back, so its everybody from Madrid and Córdoba down for San Juan then everyone else a week later."
"benistever I don't understand your post at all.Nothing is so special about next year at all... if you read what I said then you'll say I said next year OR when the risk is minimal - at the moment it's far from that. Of course that may not change, we can't predict the future, but in any event my actions have nothing to do with the world getting back to normal that's for sure so why will me not travelling make everyone else sit on the sofa and do the same??People are entitled to make their own decisions based on what they feel is right for them, not follow like sheep just because others make a particular choice."
"Hello hs, people will still be giving a million and one reasons for why others should not travel even next year rather than one reason why they should and do it safely.I am looking forward to this becoming a travel forum again not a, million and one reasons not to travel forum☺Edited: 7:38 am, June 14, 2020 "
"Oh I agree, but I would never tell anyone else what they should or shouldn't do, I do believe we can only look after ourselves and be responsible for the choices we make, the behaviour of many over the past couple of months is testament to that fact :) I too look forward to it becoming a travel forum once more as that would surely indicate that things would be getting back to normal - even if it's not the normal that we're used to.Regards"
"From the Telegraph today:Spain will open its borders to members of the EU’s Schengen Zone, plus the UK, on June 21. The border was originally due to remain closed until July 1.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced the decision today during a conference call with regional leaders, as reported by Spanish newspaper El Pais."
"Paulaf, I have a different version, UK will not be included...Regarding citizens from other countries (including the UK), the reopening of borders will depend on bilateral agreements with ‘countries with a similar or lower Covid-19 impact’ according to Sr Sanchez.https:/…"
"I know it's confusing that article says EU, technically we're still in during the transition period but it needs to be clarified I think."
"It is not confusing. The link given in #34, shows the wording given as a direct quote, so ""including the UK"", is given in brackets as one of the ""other"" countries. Also the article refers to the Schengen zone and we have never been in Schengen.Hence the UK is subject to a bilateral agreement being made.Edited: 11:02 am, June 14, 2020 "
BBC is reporting it as including the UK too.
"Link here.https:/…Edited: 11:14 am, June 14, 2020 "
"I know United Kingdom is not part of the Schengen area, but thought all EU citizens had the right to free movement when travelling within the EU, regardless of whether the country is part of Schengen or not, and UK are still part of the EU until end of December, so I am confused, but fully understand the safety aspect of air bridges or agreements...We are awaiting flights from Malaga back to UK having had flights cancelled a few times...Think more will be made clear when the BOE is published in Spain hopefully by Tuesday...x"
"Paula - I repeat what others have told you, namely that the UK has never been in the Schengen area so we are not covered by the Spanish announcement and the BBC report does not say we are."
"El pais reports all EU and Schengen countries bar portugal ( at there own request) from the 21 1st, june.Uk is still in the EU."
BBC has also reported that this includes UK (pending a reciprocal arrangement).
"This article clearly states UK will be allowed in as still considered part of EU, yes I know we're not in Schengen thanks.https://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020…"
"A bit confused, I have a NZ passport my country have zero Covid cases and I can't get into Spain but they allow UK visitors.... they spoke about allowing people in from countries with good control over the virus, when do you guys think they will open the borders in Spain to countries outside of Europe?. Cheers"
"""Government sources confirmed on Sunday evening that despite having left the bloc earlier this year, the United Kingdom is still considered an EU member state given that it is in a transition period and enjoys full membership rights. This means that UK travelers will also be able to enter Spain from June 21. """

Costa del Sol’s Andalucia Not Happy with PM’s Decision to Open Spain’s Borders 14 Days Earlierhttps:/…
"Imagine actually describing it as ‘Costa del Sol’s Andalucia’. Still, the EW News never overestimates it’s readers."
"The news from New Zealand that two British tourists allowed in on compassionate grounds have tested positive, after leaving isolation after 7 days, not the stipulated 14 days and not getting a test.Obviously they could have picked up the virus on route, but now New Zealand have banned compassionate visits and checking why the rules broken.This is not going to help our case for air bridgesEdited: 8:35 am, June 16, 2020 "
"Economics will be the biggest determinate of any air bridges between uk and spain if required,not what two people did or didn't do on the other side of the world.Travel will be back on the agenda soon and when it is there will be still a million and one reasons proffered why those willing to travel should not be able to.Edited: 9:13 am, June 16, 2020 "
"Cannot imagine the paranoia when the cold and flu season during the winter comes around, personally, as far as it depends on us, soon as there is a green light to travel we are off."
"Last winter 8000 died in the U.K from flu and less then 70% of NHS STAFF agreed to vaccination. We accept both the deaths and the failure to vaccinate. Even if we get a Covid vaccine our Health Minister has already stated it won't be mandatory for front line NHS STAFF.Like flu were just going to have to accept Covid exists. In 1968 we had 80000 deaths from flu in the U.K and no vaccine and we carried on as normal, we need to be sensible"
As long as it happens to someone else! Not everyone is sensible.
"Regretfully if people are not sensible there can be consequences. Today announced that 27% of those tested positive last week either gave incorrect contact details or refused to give details of their recent contacts.The government think these are acceptable levels of cooperation, if we don't see a big drop in positive tests by the end of the month, they may change there minds.Edited: 7:34 am, June 18, 2020 "
"I have not seen anything that said people refused to give contacts, but it has been reported a proportion gave no contacts, which I read differently. For instance we go food shopping and have bought an ice cream when out, so we could contract COVID. We have not had any 'contacts' though in the sense they are asking (someone you have been in close contact with or were fairly near for a period of time - perhaps 15 mins, not sure of exact time).I think it would only really apply to people who work with others, or have had social contact for a length of time, albeit at a distance. People may have been on public transport - but are they trying to trace everyone who may have been on the same train, but are complete strangers? The person with COVID could not give their details anyway.I also think compliance is somewhat related to how much the Government are prepared to expect their own to obey the rules and must admit after the revelations a few weeks ago it does not make me want to co operate in the way I would have been happy to do previously. It seems to be a matter of do as I say, rather than do as I do. It is said some people are citing that individual.Edited: 8:44 am, June 18, 2020 "
From the Guardianhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…
https:/…Brits will have to pass 3 health checks to enter Spain
"Interesting how you are supposed to advise whether or not you have had the virus. As until recent you were not tested even if you thought you had the virus, Public Health England admit that they have knowledge of only 30% of known cases. Add in asymptomatic carriers, seems a pointless question.As most people incubate the virus for at least 3 days before showing symptoms, taking temperature at airports etc whilst not pointless is more to do with consumer confidence. It seems Macron and Johnstone agreed an airbridge on Thursday, Spain is sure to follow on economic grounds, our 14 day isolation control expires on the 29th, unlikely to be renewed.Things are moving in the right direction."
"Seems like some small measures to give wider reassurance to all that gates are not wide open.A declaration you make about covid when most won't know for sure either way whether they have had it and temp checks and visual observation seem fairly low key in comparison to earlier speculation about hurdles travellers might face.Half full planes to allow for distancing sound long forgotten ideas too.Atb steveEdited: 8:58 am, June 20, 2020 "
"Malaga airport arrivals for tomorrow shows 2 Ryanair flights, one from Stansted & the other from Glasgow. It will be interesting to see if they go ahead & if so how things went."
As of 16:30 you can buy a seat on the Glasgow flight (£75) approximately 90 seats filled on the seat plan so if it does get cancelled it will be very last minute
"Viajero, if there are 90 seats booked on the seat plan there may be many more passengers with no seat selection, that's always an unknown."
"Yes I thought that as well, there are quite a few individual aisle seats filled which is usually where the random allocation are put, however there might also be a few more who are holding off until the very last minute before checking in just in case of a last minute change"
Clarity at last!https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-53122825
"""Spain's foreign affairs minister Arancha González Laya said UK visitors will go through a ""triple check"" upon arrival to Spain. "" (as in Post 58)But still...""The UK Foreign Office is still warning against all but essential international travel. """
That will surely change though in the coming days?
"Post 67 chris125, possibly but until it does it makes getting travel insurance very tricky & any existing policies are basically useless. The CDS is geared up for summer visitors - the lifeguards started work 2 weeks early on June 1st, the cleaning boats (10 between Nerja & Rincon) have been operating for a week & the beach supervisors began work yesterday."
"With UK government still advising against travel, people planning holidays must check the validity of their travel insurance.There is also the matter of the 14 day quarantine upon return to the UK, unless that is rescinded."
"In regards to the quarantine on return, things are looking hopeful https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-air-br…"
"More... https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53116372The sensible solution should the mandatory quarantine not be lifted... Not exactly cheap, but better than losing 2 weeks of pay or holiday time, though governmental approval for the scheme would be required"
"Neither the FCO advice or Quarantine on return would overly trouble me personally.I am happy to rely on EHIC and self funding but appreciate that doesn't apply to all.Also, I am fortunate that I can arrange for a clear few weeks after return where I can work from home. Again that doesn't apply to all but I suspect that there are many on here that are retired, part time, self employed and so on, who could do similar.Furthermore, upon checking, the quarantine is less strict than I had presumed; I could be with my family and they don't need to isolate unless they display symptoms.I appreciate that a family with school and work commitments upon return can not take this attitude and I hope for their sake that the quarantine requirement is lifted soon, which seems likely.Edited: 6:35 am, June 21, 2020 "
By early july FCO advice and quarantine may well be a thing of the past. It won't though prevent another glut of reasons on here why those willing to travel shouldn't by those not willing.Atb steve
The Stansted - Malaga flight is on route & the Glasgow is still scheduled for later today. Also a few other international flights arriving.Things are beginning to move.
"*It won't though prevent another glut of reasons on here why those willing to travel shouldn't by those not willing.*I agree. Most on here mean well but the best way to decide is to weigh up the risks, read the official advice and then use a big dollop of common sense!"
"Boris hinted today that things will be changing very soon, so maybe quarantine will be lifted with airbridge countries, but as above, way up risks of travel, we have been in Spain since Feb, so all through strict lockdown and now we are waiting for Jet2 flights from Malaga back to UK, which start on July 15th, don't really fancy flying with maybe 150 plus people and wearing a mask for 3hrs, but taking the risk to get home..Safe travels everyone...x"
