"Hello, Has anyone stayed here please?Never been to Kamala is the location ok? Any help much appreciated thanks.Also can anyone recommend how to get here from Patong?"
is the location ok? for what There is plenty of info about the hotel and what is nearby so have no idea what extra info you may be seekingINPUT=OUTPUT
"I meant as I have never been before could someone please tell me if the location is good for restaurants, bars the beach etc. I am sorry if I didn't make it clear."
I always think it is good to hear personal experiences of a place.
"After three holidays in the (sometimes oppressive?) madness of Patong, I now base myself in Kamala - fourth visit coming up, hopefully.It's a far more relaxing area to stay but there are still plenty of bars and restaurants. The beach is fine, although I prefer to day-trip to Layan, Nai Thon or Nai Yang.If you are a clubbing/party animal then Patong is better, although Kamala is only a fifteen minute ride away on a scooter for the occasional ""wild"" night out.No idea about the Wabi Sabi I'm afraid - never heard of it!Edited: 6:51 am, July 19, 2020 "
"Thanks so much for the reply, we have stayed in Patong before and Karon but fancy a change so trying Kamala for 5 nights and then off to Ao Nang for 7 nights. Wabi Sabi looks quite new so that's probably why you haven't heard of it!!"
"In Kamala, I enjoyed Salt & Pepper.Good grub and decent cocktails."
"good location, walking to beach,restaurants,shopping. BUT there are better hotels/resorts in KamalaNote many of the resorts/hotels in Phuket are currently not open.U'll take a taxi or tuk tuk...apx 400 baht one way"
we are supposed to go late December
"Back in April I booked and paid my flights for early December and also reserved an apartment and scooter.However, Thailand is showing absolutely no signs of wishing to open up for tourism (apparently the general population think we are filthy) and so my optimism is diminishing by the day!Tourism is (was) important for the Thai economy, but not THAT important! A very bad situation for us."
I didn't realise it was as bad as that! I had better start thinking about plan B! We always go away for Christmas. I wonder when it will change?
"Agree with #10, and think Thailand being open in 2020 is very optimistic. If so, some type of quarantine, which on holiday would be silly.Good Luck#4 ... I hope you were referring to scooter taxi vs self driving ... ""Kamala is only a fifteen minute ride away on a scooter for the occasional ""wild"" night out""Edited: 12:12 am, July 21, 2020 "
The worst of it is I suppose is we won't know until about 2 weeks before if the flights are cancelled and then flights to anywhere else will be stupidly expensive. I personally only use taxi bikes not self drive.
"@ Not Me - I always hire and ride a scooter myself and am well-known at the Patong~Kamala police checkpoint!I have been riding since my sixteenth birthday and nowadays I take it easy - not guaranteed 100% safe, but I'm not as risk-averse as many and enjoy riding and value the freedom and independence.Edited: 6:15 am, July 21, 2020 "
personally would not use taxi bike or own scooter you have no idea if the driver is safe /drunk /drugged in addition to the other idiots on the roadBest option is to pay a bit more for flights you can change if necessary
"there are no taxi bikes in Kamala, at least none i have seen in 24 years of living here..plus riding one at night after a night out in patong is just.....plain stupid"
Taxi mafia definitely wouldn't allow that / scooter cart taxis. Not sure how they'd do on any hills anyway.
"True - no bike taxis seem to be based in Kamala, but they will ride from Patong at three in the morning to do a pick-up!No problem at all for a PCX/Click tackling the hilly journey two-up - it's the Tuk-Tuks that struggle."
Flights are booked already Alistair
"The government is now drafting a plan and say, visitors permitted entry must come from a country with at least 60 days with no new cases and for 30 days no covid-19 active cases. It's unlikely we see any tourists by Christmas."
"Those conditions are NEVER going to be met by any country that is truthful about their CoViD-19 reporting!Bye bye Thailand - it was fun!Edited: 6:31 am, July 22, 2020 "
