FCO have just added Canaries and Balearics to essential travel only as of this evening. Insurance will be invalid if people travel
Yes just seen this.
So it dosent look optimistic for an airbridge to the islands.
Michael Gove publicly ruled out an air bridge for the Islands about an hour ago so the FCO change is no surprise.
This just smacks of the Government wanting to save face after numerous experts have been stating transmission rates in the Canary's is low. Government ballsed up with an over reaction instating quarantine for the islands and instead of being sensible and reversing it they try to save face by extending it. Utter madness.
"Thank's for posting this, I'd not heard the news - just been on to Gov website to check."
What insurance is invalid if you travel?
it will be your insurance!
Yes but what does the insurance cover?

I have 2 week holiday booked for early August. Now that FCO has added tenerife to the non essential travel list does this mean I can get a full refund as normal?
"Why do people think they know better than those will real live data? Spain has had rises all over not just the north and over 6500 cases since Friday. The actual numbers are almost the same as the numbers they had when spain started to lockdown and its the risk to exponential growth that's the worry, Canary islands has low cases of course but they are rising fast - even if there still low, experience from the beginning of the epidemic shows how quickly they escalate - each person infects another et etc and they now know there's community transmission in many areasThis decision wasn't made for nothing and many should be glad people are being taken care off. Our vulnerable and shielding are now emerging out of confinement and should we just undo that by allowing thousands of people o return from areas which are higher risk of whom many wont isolate?Yes its sad for businesses there but bloody hell get a grip we have had one of the worst deaths rates of all of this and our vulnerable need to continue to be protected"
At least jet2 will be forced to refund now.

"Martha. For months we were totally locked down. We couldn’t even go outside for 15 minutes to exercise. It wasn’t like the UK. Armed Policía and the civil guard patrolled the streets several times a day, even on sleepy Menorca. Health services virtually ground to a halt. So, please don’t get preaching numbers at us. Over the last 72 hours, Menorca accumulated just 7 new positives. All contacts tracked and traced to source. For this we pay the price of no UK visitors and you seem almost gleeful, gloating! The UK been such a beacon in a dark world of how to get it right!"
"Hi, if the government reverts to previous changed decisions, it will be reversed in 2 weeks time."
"I would like a like button for post 19 we had exactly the same in Tenerife. It was like house arrest the UK didn't know they were born and all they did was moan. The cases per 100,000 in the islands are around 5 whereas they are 3 times that in the UK. We haven't had a single death since 13 June. This is all political, UK have lost face so many times they think they can now save face but as usual they have got it wrong and over reacted."
I seem to remember the Balearic's slapping a tourist tax on us because they were not getting enough cash from us already.How things have changed. Now they are begging for us to return.
"Martha where are you dreaming this up from? About 700 people were dying a day in Spain for a few weeks running, it’s about 20 a day now."
If the Spanish Government are still happy to accept British holiday makers they could quite easily make all medical care free for tourists thus getting round the issue of holiday insurance being null and void for people wishing to travel
"Allan,there are 68 million folks in UK,just over 2m in all of the canaries .So its not hard to work out that there may be more cases over here."
"Allan, time to let it go mate."
"Spain went into lockdown on 14 march 2020 when they had 5643 cases and 550 deathsFast forward two weeks and they had 7340 deaths and 85,195 cases on 31 march 2020That's exponential growth for youNew cases of over 6000 in the last weekend and no one bats an eye lid now - wow that's the worry"
"Oh come on, that’s not what the eco tax is about. Would you like to provide people with a link so that people can see what projects it is being spent on? I certainly don’t agree with all of the projects, but are you also taking issue with the tourist tax in Barcelona and other places, or just the Balearics?"
"Martha from mid March to mid July testing increased at least 6 fold, lots more cases and far less deaths = very good.Edited: 4:19 pm, July 27, 2020 "
craigthose low deaths may have something to do with the fact no one went out for months! ICU admissions have risen from 3/4 to 40-50 a day in the last week - massively lower than at the peak but people really don't get exponential growth- once it starts.....
Martha average time from getting it to death is 14-21 days not 3.5 months.
Qualityspy you do a grand job helping people on here. I’m really enjoying trying to make people less miserable.
"Spy1, they called it an eco tax.I call it biting the hand that feeds you.Or just plain greed.The amount of cash that the Spanish gov gets from us Brits is not enough already?"
Need to book Turkey instead
If your taken I'll have accident or need any medical treatment your own insurance is void so you would have to pay your own medical bills
"Why not, if it is just for this year only book a holiday here and help our economy in hotels, cottages, caravan parks also shops pubs and restaurants etc,Edited: 4:50 pm, July 27, 2020 "
Lots of people booked holidays before Covid-19 was invented.
holidays are more exciting with no insurance
"Healthcare. If you are not worried, your EHIC card still covers you for basic healthcare, but no additional things."
"I did too Craig.I was in Tenerife when it started, our holiday was cut short, then cancelled September holiday to Cyprus that was booked last year so we decided to book a holiday in UK."
"Some people must just prefer to holiday outside the UK?Edited: 5:29 pm, July 27, 2020 "
"Yes I do too, but in this situation no."
"Then that’s your choice, not everyone has the same rationale is the answer to your question."
