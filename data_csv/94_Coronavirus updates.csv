One great thing in Greece's favour is that they will be able to use 'best practice' from other countries in how best to treat people who are hospitalised. Hopefully that will also help to keep the death rate very low.

I do not think it is looking good for those of us with holidays booked for August or September. I cannot see this going anywhere other than closed borders and cancelled flights right now. I really hope I am wrong.

I think you will be fine. I was reading about the figures from Turkey today and I’m sure that they have 900 new cases. There are various factors involved. It isn’t purely about case numbers. It’s also about the protocols that are in place in hotels and resorts and at airports etc to handle any spike in cases. It’s also about the availability of medical facilities etc. I’m sure your hols will go ahead. Maybe by then the uk will have an improved system in place to allow people to travel more freely e.g. testing at uk airports.
"If we go we wont go till October I just find it all too risky, however I would like to go now. Lol"
My guess is the Balkans
The problem in the UK is that I sense a lack of willingness to enable holidays and travel. There are those who say that it suits the government very well to keep us in the UK to spend our holiday budget at home. There is a lot of anti-travel attitude. As people travel again it was to be expected that the number of covid cases would rise. I had hoped that would be allowed for and it would be about what healthcare systems can cope with. The problem is that nobody can predict how high the numbers will go and if it will be about deaths and ICU beds again. The authorities in many European countries are getting very twitchy about trends and wanting to act earlier this time round. I was optimistic for quite a while but I am losing that today.

"#12 &18. Youve echoed my thoughts today UnaW. Especially as I read from August 1st. the first cruise ships will be allowed to visit. I realise it will take a few weeks for cruises to get organised but I do agree, I can only see it going one way. And also like you, I would rather be going now than waiting til September.Mussye. I so hope youre right and you enjoy the last few days of your hols. Your updates have been appreciated."
#15. Apologies Pandit. It was you who said you'd rather go now!!! I agree. And thanks for the summary of the figures.
"The cases are rising daily 52, 57 and 65 today. Greece could close its borders or not ? They have got good funds now from the EU"
"I'm due to fly next saturday, hoping it Will still go ahead."

Why the panic? With these latest figures I don't see the issue. They would have to inflate massively for these to match countries like the UK and Spain. Still very hopeful things will be ok for us end August.
I think the thing on everyone's mind also is it safe at the destnation.
They could for certain countries like the Balkans
Yes - it looks like it wasn’t the best move to open the borders to Balkan countries in the first place.
"If the cases in any country go up Greece could close its borders to that country. From Finland from June it has been possible to go to Greece but from Sweden flights are just starting. Greece would not allow Finns in May. So it not only depends on Greece it also depends on our countries of origin.Edited: 4:18 pm, July 30, 2020 "

78 is still very small. Condolences for the 3 people who have passed away.
"Yes small when compared to the UK, France and Sweden"
17 of the new cases have been detected among tourists in the country.
"Greece has increased it's rules for wearing of face masks, due to the increases of cases this week.Now masks are compulsory (fine of E150) in all indoor public spaces. & strongly recommended outside in busy areas.Other restrictions like max 100 people at a wedding & religious events, no hospital or care home visits, no standing in entertainment venues (clubs etc). & masks now compulsory in churches.https://www.ekathimerini.com/255330/article/…"

"@Deb R re #16I think you’re right to question the reporting of some countries numbers. I read a while back that the Spanish government collects the data from the various regions of Spain but then only report the number of deaths that occurred on the day they are reporting on. For some time now they have been reporting just 2 deaths on most days - which I find very hard to believe. When the UK reports its numbers, they pick up historic ones that haven’t been reported before e.g. yesterday’s total included some deaths that occurred in June and out of the 114 deaths reported for England only 11 happened on the 30th. It does make comparisons quite difficult."
110 new cases - 9 at the gateshttps:/…
In English todays updatehttps:/…
Just to add from 48 the cases on Crete are now totally 58.
"We have new cases detected in ChaniaThe new cases of coronavirus in our country have been announced.The new laboratory-confirmed cases of the disease are 75, of which 4 were identified after checks at the country's gates.The total number of cases is 4662 (daily change + 1.6%), of which 54.7% are men."

"There were 4 new corona virus cases yesterday in Crete: 2 in Chania - of which 1 is in hospital, the other in quarantine at home, & 2 in Heraklio region.Sadly, I think that's the biggest number in a day since the start of the pandemic :("
What’s your feelings on the tourism business continuing throughout this summer? We due to fly Crete mid August but my gut feeling is maybe not!
"Personally I think Greece will try its hardest not to stop all tourism. Bottom line is, they need the tourists' dollars. They are already adding restrictions & are more likely to do more of those. & local lockdowns where there are spikes.Fines are being put in place for individuals & companies who flout the rules. Some have started to be enforced, police are checking mask wearing, handing out E150 fines, a couple of bars in Rethymno fined / closed this weekend, for instance, for having too many people inside.Most new cases being identified are currently not tourists.Many were workers from the Balkans, rules & tests now in place to prevent these.Guests at weddings, meat factories.More cases in the big cities - Athens, Thessaloniki.There are some concerns that new spread may be caused by Athenian's usual August exodus to the islands.But things are changing rapidly, one thing 2020 is teaching us all - there are no guarantees this year!"
I think its only this month the cases will rise as Greeks move up and down the country. The newer cases as I read are from Greeks themselves and not from foreigners. I think tourism will go on as usual. There can be a limit on timings of bars and restaurants.

Oh no! I've just booked flights. Should I cancel I have 24 hours to cancel? Don't want Boris putting 24 day quarantine on the country
"Let’s be honest folks. These numbers are tiny! We had 900 odd today in the UK. Cases are inevitable but these numbers are tiny. There are folk here that do their utmost to scare people. Yes, every case is a bad thing but we are all going to have to get used to this. If we stop travelling completely because of 65 cases in a country with a huge landmass then we are just taking things too far. I think you’re safe. Turkey had 900 cases last week and is still on the safe list. Chill."

"Yes I get what your saying a lot of it is scaremongering and like you say the cases are very small for the size of the country and so on but the only reason I'm worried is due to the fact Boris stopped holidays to the Spanish islands. I was supposed to go to Majorca next week and their cases were really low and were doing a fantasic job but Boris messed it up which doesn't make sense at all. My fear is that he could easily do the same to any other country so I'm always on edge. I go to Corfu on Sunday I'm just praying I get there, I've worked through this whole thing and would love to feel a bit of normality and get away"
Greece wont do anything about Boris I dont know. The cases are very small right now. Take the usual care steps like mask etc. and you should be fine. The Greeks are doing their best which is so wonderful
"Deb I don’t think we needed a geography lesson. Thanks for wasting your time though looking up land areas. You must truly be bored. It seems anything I post you love to attack. The point is, the numbers are very small. Spain is a different story. The islands are largely unaffected, it’s the mainland that is the issue. However, Boris perhaps feels that it would be pointless allowing travel to the islands and not the mainland, as technically people could go between the islands and the mainland."
"121 new coronavirus cases in Greece today 04.08.2020. 5 were detected after checks at the country's gateways.Koronovirus in Crete: One person in the ICU, three in the special units covid-19"
Wow not good Boris defo gonna put travel restrictions down by end of week
"Let's hope not, James.Cyprus has changed Greece's travel code to an 'amber' light this week.The first 'daily briefing' after 2 months today, with our lovely Dr Tsiodras. People were listening to him & abiding (mostly) by the rules during lockdown, that's my hunch as to why he's back today, to hopefully 'encourage' social distancing,wear masks, avoid crowds etc. This week & next are the busiest for Greek summer holidays, hence the desire to stop people having big parties, attend packed clubs etc. to minimise internal travel spread.He is asking for everyone to follow the protocols more carefully & telling young people that they are not immune."
James VXR. Highly doubt it. He’d have a cheek to with our rates still so high. Shambles here. Sorry if that offends but it’s been one huge mess. No temperature checks or anything at Manchester airport. Greece are more rigorous than as at borders.
"Mussye - Agree it would be rather rich coming from us! I also don't think Spain and Greece can really be compared at this stage.. I think the numbers would need to go up considerably for Boris to take the same action with Greece. But who knows.. Greece have done a pretty good job so far, they need to keep the economy alive as well as keeping people safe, and I don't think they've done a bad job at all at trying to find that balance."
"Some of today's new changes:it will now be possible to limit the hours of nightclubs, decisions can be made at local level All people coming into Greece from Albania must quarantine for 7 daysMax 100 attendees now for all weddings, christenings, funerals, social events"
"Just for some context, I believe the figure that's looked at for quarantine decisions is the cases in the past 14 days per 100,000 of the population. Greece is currently 6.8 (though that'll go up a bit after today), Spain is 68.6. Uk is 14.3."
"It's undoubtably right that the UK & other nations still have much higher covid rates than Greece, so I agree the UK is unlikely to introduce quarantine after travelling, for now at least.From the other side, Greece sadly is back at R=12 new ICU cases in Heraklio yesterday.It's a good idea to keep up to date as possibly more restrictions will be (re)-introduced within Greece if these numbers continue to rise. We are promised by the Greek authorities that full lock-down will be avoided if at all possible. Local lock-downs more likely."
I so envy those of you who are even able to contemplate os holidays at present. Here in Aus we can’t even travel freely between states let alone leave the country!
"When the number of infections is low, as it is in Greece, the R rate has very little meaning. For example, if only one person was known to have the virus, and they passed it on to two other people, the R rate becomes 2. That doesn't mean the pandemic is out of hand."
It seems out of hand I keep seeing people share articles and stuff that don't like very good for travel
"JamesVXRThe thing is, there are those people who have decided NOT to travel this year and there are those people who have decided otherwise ( like me ). I would in no way dream of even INSINUATING that those choosing to stay at home are making the wrong decision but unfortunately it doesn't seem to work the other way. It is a totally PERSONAL choice. Keep yourself informed of the situation and decide whats best for you:-))"
"Today new cases in the country - 78 new cases, 3 deadEODY announced 78 new cases of the new coronavirus in the country, of which 10 were detected after checks at the entrance gates. The total number of cases is 4,477, of which 54.8% are men."
"Whether someone is travelling to Crete this season or not isnt relevant , as this forum is all about giving the correct information so posters can then make their own decision as to whether they travel or not.And Personally, I find the information from posters like SteveSitia and Adonis who are actually living in Crete very helpful, keeping us updated :-)Edited: 11:33 am, August 05, 2020 "
"Thats ANDONIS not Adonis!!! One cant argue that the information given is correct but it should always be made clear that the majority of cases ( so far) are NOT relevant to the islands. Northern greece is well removed from whats happening in Crete. I have no idea how things will progress and it could well be that my September holiday doesnt happen and i'm perfectly ok with that. So I repeat, you stay home if you want to, but if the Greek government and the UK government allow me to go , then I will go."
"<< Thats ANDONIS not Adonis!!!>> Gosh I am so sorry Andonis....how rude of me to get your name wrong Whilst I totally agree that the number of cases in Greece aren’t reflected in Crete, we still need to know what’s happening, as if the numbers do increase rapidly in Greece, just like Spain our Government will impose exactly the same travel ban on the whole of Greece, just as they did for the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands who have very low cases.Although it’s not relevant, we have had three flights to Crete cancelled this year, transferred another to next year and still have a flight booked for October which we are keeping our fingers crossed to can use, as we are missing our home in Crete."
So what's the chances I will get to go on Sunday with todays new deaths and cases?
"Hi JamesI am afraid most peoples crystal balls are currently being re-calibrated. Nobody knows what will happen today, tomorrow, next week. If you do get to Greece, from all your posts, I guess you will equally be worried about getting home without quarantine. Its a difficult situation that nobody knows the answer to."
JamesVXR. The chances for you travelling this weekend are excellent in my opinion. The cases in Crete are not a cause for concern imminently. Have a great holiday :-))
"Now we have new update and it is not good. We are concerned here.124, according to the announcement of EODY:""Today we announce 124 new cases of the new virus in the country, of which 15 were detected after checks at the country's gateways. The total number of cases is 4973, of which 54.6% are men."
"Worse situation is we discover today ministry is hiding real numbers with imported cases.Only the competent services of EODY know about the imported incidents, which, however, following the orders of the General Secretariat for Civil Protection, and the Deputy Minister of Civil Protection, Nikos Hardalias, keep the number of cases a seven-sealed secret!"
Thanks for this Andonis
So the government isnt being entirely transparent with the figures. Join the club !!
"I was just reading this, and it does seem like most of today's new cases are in clusters (that are hopefully being managed and contained). https:/…"
"Coronavirus alarm in Greece: 153 new cases - Second highest record since the beginning of the pandemicAugust 6, 2020 EODY announced 153 new cases of coronavirus in our country in the last 24 hours.The announcement of EODYToday we announce 153 new cases of the new virus in the country, of which 11 were detected after checks at the country's gateways."
"In addition to the new cases, as reported above, a couple of notable travel related things today:A tourist who'd flown into Crete from UK & was in a quarantine hotel has been moved into Chania hospital as their symptoms worsened.A club in Platanias has been charged E3,000 & closed for 2 weeks (the middle 2 weeks or August - ouch!) for hosting a party with too many guests.& a similar case the previous day.& a ferry operator is in trouble after a Gavdos ferry was found to have too many passengers on board. Further E150 fines were given out for not wearing masks, Crete has the 3rd largest number of fines.It is estimated that approx 28% of covid cases are related to travel."
Thank you both Andonis and Steve for these posts and keeping us updated.
"Steve, does anyone know, what part of the U.K. this tourist in Hospital originally came from??"
"Confirmed cases of coronavirus in Crete have risen to 64.According to Zarpanews the man iS German but lives in UKhttps:/…A foreigner who until today was in the quarantine hotel was transported to the hospital of Chania by EKAB ambulance, as it was a confirmed incident of covid - 19.The foreigner was transported today to the hospital of Chania, from the hotel that was under restraint, as upon his arrival at the airport he was found to be positive in the coronavirus test.During his stay, he began to show symptoms which, according to a protocol, means the need for his treatment in a nursing unit and so on Thursday afternoon, he was transported to Chania Hospital through EKAB for his further treatment.According to secure information of zarpanews.gr, this is a German citizen, who lives in Great Britain and is 31 years old."
"DarkBlueDundee - No, I haven't seen it announced which UK airport he flew from. He is German but lives permanently in the UK."
"Hi Andonis / Steve,Thanks for your continuous updates. Has the Greek Govt. mentioned how they intend to deal with this ongoing situation, local lockdowns or worse pulling up the drawbridge ?Many thanks and kind regards John"
Where is the local lockdowns at?
"From tomorrow, Friday, all of Greece’s land border crossings will be closed between 11pm and 7am, with the exception of the country’s northern entry point with Bulgaria, Promachonas. Restrictions remain in place at the Balkan road borders for essential travel only & fro people from Bulgaria requiring a confimed negative test prior to travel. John, The Greek authorities are still saying they do not intend to make any general lock-down, but they may introduce local lockdowns if necessary. & they will continue to make smaller restrictions as necessary - perhaps further reducing the numbers of customers in bars , further reducing number of guests at weddings etc. It seems there may be localised mandatory closing hours for bars coming soon."
"#89 there are no local lockdowns yet, but looking at the figures I'd imagine if they Greek Govt did decide to go down that route it'd be done in one or more of the mainland regions (Attica and Thessaloniki currently have the higher numbers, but of course they are the most populated areas).Edited: 1:23 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"This is a now a similar rate of new infections as the UK (per 100,000) but also rising much faster. We are due to fly out next week but it’s hard to see the air corridor staying open 2 or 3 more weeks unless the numbers stabilise. Unfortunately as shown with Spain the UK government is not willing to make exceptions for islands."
I'm flying to Athen in 10days for 2 weeks and going on a roadtrip. I hope it will stabilize
It's getting as bad as the UK?! That's not good as heres me thinking only 2 days to go but looking doubtful now. Each day seems to be worse I think Saturday will be when they stop travel either UK goverment or Greece
"I hope not JamesVXR, we travel next Saturday!"
"99mcr i know its a shame. Seems like it's heading that way with how the cases keep going upEdited: 1:52 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Thanks for the updates, due to arrive in crete Saturday."
I am hoping if the worst comes to the worst Boris will quarantine regions rather than the country as a whole seeing as Greece is made up of many (safe) islands however looking at what he did with Spain its doubtful.
"Not a fan of Boris or any of his mates for what he did with the Spanish islands, that was bad. I personally think he will do the same for anywhere else. It was a Saturday when he did that, let's hope this Saturday it doesn't happen again"
"JamesVXR. You'll be fine. France is next on Boris's hit list. I wish I was going on Saturday and not having to keep everything crossed til September! But please , if you get there, will you let us all know how youre getting on:-))"
Hopefully lightning doesn't strike twice JamesVXR!! got everything crossed as already had two cancelled this year!
Should be travelling in 2 weeks. Beginning to think that it wont happen. I do hope that a decisive decision will be made by the Greek and/or British government before we travel should the cases continue to rise.
Maggie ill definitely keep everyone updated if we get to go

I would check the cancellation policy of the villa you have set your heart on (or contact the owners direct) and take it from there."
"Norway have just put France, Czech Republic and one other on the quarantine list due to covid numbers.

"I simply see & report facts as they occur daily in Greece, in order to allow people to make up their own minds. As are a couple of other people on this thread, facts - not speculation.There was a lot of very vocal speculation by some on this forum a few months ago stating that it's just flu & will be gone by Easter! & now saying that Crete is absolutely perfect, wonderful, paradise, no issues whatsoever full stop!As has been said several times this week: - yes Greece's covid levels are still much smaller than the UK's, Spain & some other countries'. However the Greek Government has already been seen to make fast, decisive actions, such as in early March when a very swift, strong lockdown came as a shock. It worked. There is no denying the cases are increasing currently & the Greek authorities are trying to control it.I will say it again - they do NOT want to lockdown, that is unlikely to happen. They do NOT want to close all the borders, that is also unlikely. There MAY be local lockdowns coming, which would not likely initially be on the islands. More news about this will continue to be posted. Some people find these facts useful to help them decide whether their holiday is worth the risk this year. Some don't want to know, both are absolutely fine."
#113 I wasn't referring to you.
Everyone should see the reality of the situation and not blame the governments.
Thank-you Steve for your honest opinions and reporting. You have eased my fears about my imminent 3 week road trip to Crete.Kind regardsJohn
"The risk is from the indiscriminate UK government quarantine not Greece shutting down its tourist industry again. The fact is, not speculation, that adjusted for population 150 cases in Greece is equivalent to more than 900 in the UK in terms of contact risk which will inform quarantine decisions. (It is misleading to downplay this. See Belgium situation quarantined with much fewer new cases than the UK.) The Greek level is not a quarantine risk yet but it is rising very rapidly and not yet proven to have been stabilised by the new measures. These are important facts to consider. My opinion is that if you have to make decisions on spending unrefundable money on a trip to Greece in the next few weeks it is best to wait to see if the measures imposed by the Greek government work and the numbers stabilise."
"Excellent post #113 your posts are exactly what I’m looking for so I can make a balanced decision whether to travel to Crete this year.unfortunately, there are a few very well meaning regulars posters who haven’t travel to Crete this year giving their opinion, which can causes confusion.Edited: 3:42 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Hayley, if you have your set on this villa I would also contact the owner and request a refundable booking or ask them to contact you before they accept another booking for your dates. Times are incredibly hard for the travel industry and you may be surprised what they will agree to, and if it is a private booking with a Cretan they will do everything they can to help you."

"As testing and confirmed cases are consistently growing across pretty much all of Europe, it is *maybe* possible that the acceptable growth rate threshold will be adjusted by governments accordingly when making such decisions regarding travel restrictions, but who knows."
"There was a report on the news this morning about a music festival, I think on Zante, where 4000 tickets have been sold, but the Government has banned all festivals. There is no current ban on large wedding parties. The couple who are running the event claim they are getting married and all 4000 ticket holders are invited to the wedding, where the music will be played. If that isn't a recipe for disaster I don't know what it."
"That's crazy, Keitht, it can't be allowed to go ahead, surely? Dreadful. & anyone who's been to a Greek wedding knows there is a lot of hugging & kissing, as well as contact dancing. Zero chance of social distancing being maintained.There is supposed to be a limit of 100 now for weddings - it's funny as that is considered too few for a wedding in Greece, whereas in UK people were very excited about the prospect of being allowed 30 guests, I believe that got postponed :("
"For those asking about local restrictions, here is an example - NOT Crete - but who knows where may be next?In Poros they have a spike of cases. It has been tracked to young people attending a beach bar party & then unfortunately passing the virus on to relatives who work in municipal services and also businesses in which they have contact with the public.The new local restrictions for the island include: - closure of all bars, clubs, restaurants, cafes from 11pm - 7am, banning all events, banning more than 9 people meeting anywhere; private as well as public, max 6 people at a table in a cafe/bar/restaurant if immediate family, else only 4. All municipal offices closed, playground, public toilets closed."
"In Poros they are now required to wear face masks everywhere, indoors and outdoors.Edited: 7:53 am, August 07, 2020 "
"I believe there is currently a festival taking place from today until Sunday in Zante, called GEM Fest."
As its getting worse each day how bad is it now? Is it close to being shutdowns on Corfu?

"Boris be putting quarantine in place tomorrow, that's my bet"
"Look at the current 14 day cumulative number of Covid cases per 100,000 James VXR....Spain 79.8, Belgium 52.9, France 24.2, Holland 26.5, Portugal 26.1, Croatia 18.9....Greece 9.4..Whilst none of us can be sure how things will develop these figures should make you feel a tad more optimistic....I’m off to Kefalonia on Wednesday and will be very surprised if the situation changes between now and then."
"& some more small changes today:All visitors from Malta, from Wednesday 12 Aug, must have a negative molecular control (PCR) result for the coronavirus, which will have been carried out up to 72 hours before their entry into Greece.The Holy Synod of the Church of Greece has suspended all liturgies during the next couple of weeks, incl the holiday on 15th Aug.All kinds of trade fairs cancelled.& the restriction banning standing customers in all nightclubs, bars, clubs, live music centers, bars-restaurants, cafes-bars, etc.is extended until 31-08-2020"
It’s gone up by about 1 since yesterday though? If that trend were to continue...... I go in 2 weeks don’t want it to be announced that I have to quarantine when I get back!
"Good EveningThe situation in Crete remains very good without a worrying increase in cases.It is amazing that although the increase in incoming tourism is dramatically high, no measures have been taken by the central government conserning Crete.Even so, the maintenance of the measures is very carefully observed throughout the island!Happy holidays everyone!"
"After what Boris did with the Spanish islands I can imagine he would do something stupid like do the same with Greece. And it's gone up by 1 since yesterday so tomorrow probably be around 10, hopefully that doesn't worry themEdited: 1:11 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"Let’s hope the trend doesn’t continue then.... it’s clear that the government want us to holiday in this country, they refer to staycations in every interview. Although judging by the pictures of English beaches today, I’m pretty sure it’s safer elsewhere!"
"JamesVXR. From todays Greek press. "" Greece’s health authorities announced 151 new coronavirus cases on Friday evening, the third day in a row where the daily cases are over 150. The majority of new cases are domestic ones, have been detected again in the urban centers in Attica and Thessaloniki with a spike of 46 and 38 new infections respectivelyOnly 12 of the news cases have been detected among travelers.""Get your last minute packing done, have an early night and ENJOY YOUR HOLIDAYEdited: 1:28 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"2 bars in Hersonissos, Crete were shut by the police today for 15 days & fined 5-15,000Euros after having too many customers & allowing some to be standing. Police state that the rapid increase in cases of coronavirus in Greece makes police checks even more necessary."
Maggie we don't go until Sunday morning but fingers crossed nothing happens for a while! I'm getting excited it's time to get away from the madness
"Anyone fancy having a guess at our chance of our holiday happening, we go a week tomorrow and believe me everything's crossed!i'm saying 50/50!"
JamesVXR. I thought it was Saturday you were going. But regardless I really hope you have a great time.Its really encouraging that the Greek authorities are cracking down on the bad behavior of the local people as well as testing incoming tourists
"ΗιSources from the Cretan police department told press circles that Crete is the island of success in the fight against the spread of the virus and this will continue by all means.And for this very reason they will take all the necessary measures to continue this success.They asked the shopkeepers to take the right measures on their own to avoid what happened in Hersonissos.It is not pleasant for the police themselves to close stores, but this will continue since our health is above all."
"Thanks! what will be will be, we have no control over these things so time will tell!!"
"There is no doubt that Greece is going in the wrong direction right right. The police are giving the fines but the lack of social distancing is scary. Let's hope Boris doesn't follow these guys, https:/…"
As you say time will tell 99Mcr but crossing all fingers for you and have an amazing time when you travel.
Oh that's not good things getting worse day by day but badly. I seriously think Boris will quarantine this weekend if not definitely early next week. Too much going on now
"The sad thing is however good Crete’s figures are, the UK Government will make a decision on the Greek figures, as they did with Spain :-( Let’s hope with the new restrictions in Greece the figures will start to reduce....fingers crossed"
"Lucy, the US department (your link) says the same about my country, Norway, which has been a success up until now. Yes, we have a small spike again this last week or so. But they give the same reason; ""Health care system may be overwhelmed"", therefore risky going to Norway. We have 256 deaths so far. The hospitals never came close to being overwhelmed. Some of these travel advices have a political ""smell"" to them."
"""After what Boris did with the Spanish islands I can imagine he would do something stupid like do the same with Greece""Maybe not just now. He's just gone on holidays (or will go in the next day or two) to Corfu. So he'll at least wait until he's back from holidays."
@JamesVXRWhy would Boris put restrictions on Greece over the 15/20 countries with worse figures ?
Boris has gone to corfu? Really? Can't find nothing on that haha
Ugh the trend has continued and it’s gone up. I doubt the government will put restrictions on yet but I really can’t quarantine when I get back!
We go 18th til 25th August and I can’t quantine either. This holiday malarkey is getting more stressful by the day!!
"If quarantine is brought in for return to the UK, it won't be a question for whether you feel you can quarantine or not. Unless you in an exempt category there will be no choice in the matter. In order to signify just how serious ignoring that requirement is, I believe the fine for failure to comply should be in the thousands from the outset."
Yes I know. By saying I can’t quarantine it doesn’t mean I won’t. It means that I can’t ..... and so I won’t go if I know beforehand that quarantine is in force.

Sorry it wasn't intended as a direct reference to you two. More of a general warning that if a person is on holiday when a quarantine requirement is introduced there would be no choice as to whether or not they complied with that requirement.

August is the worst as too many people domestic and international travel. If not booked I think end September would be better than now. The virus is not taking it easy anywhere now.

"I had a plan to keep an eye out for updates on the situation, and if it was still OK at the end of this week, I was going to book flights etc for a solo week in Crete at the end of August...... Only to find out that my driving licence has 'expired' (due to the virus its extended by 7 months but on the card its down as expired in June), and so I wouldn't be able to rent a car which for me is a must on holidays.Ehh what a shame, maybe it's a sign."
""" so I wouldn't be able to rent a car which for me is a must on holidays""Don't be so sure. A Greek car rental place might well be aware of the extension (and is legality) and let you rent a car. Email them."
"JeanCrete I'm giving that a go, but fully expect to receive a negative response and I wouldn't blame them. The infuriating thing is due to not having a UK passport I can't renew it online and have to mess around with getting and filling out forms from a post office, sorting out photos, paying etc etc.Nevermind, perhaps I'll get to enjoy this holiday next year with the added bonus of the virus situation being a lot more positive."
RLX get the online code for your license and they will be able to access your up to date license details.
"Good morningI don't think it's even worth trying.Even if the expiration date of your driving license escapes the eye of an inexperienced employee, you should still be aware of the possibility of a minor accident even if the other driver is to blame.In any case, the insurers of both vehicles and possibly the police will be involved.It is not going to escape their perception.In addition to the penalties that the car rental company will receive you will lose the car and the money and you will probably receive a fine or a detention of a few days if there is a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday.At least your vacation will be ruined."

"#171 Thank you for the advice, as I say I don't intend to be sneaky about it, no harm in emailing the rental companies like I have done but I'm 99.9% sure they will say no, even though legally my licence is still valid which can be proven by a quick online check on the UK driving agency website, but it's a random and complicated situation so I'm already set on not going."
As it’s getting closer to my holiday I’m feeling more reassured that a quarantine when returning from Greece won’t be imposed as one still hasn’t been imposed for France has it? I’m starting to feel like the Spain one was political especially as they included the canaries where numbers are low
The Canaries will have their own people coming in from Spain and will therefore mix with others on holiday
"HiI am surprised as in Greece the extention of driving license don't need more than couple hours, the time someone needs to visit two doctors. Then in traffic ministry and in no time we got the new license. Except if someone belongs in special category."
Dimitris.....because of the situation licence's were automatically extended for 7 months so they have a valid licence and are legal to drive but they haven't had the actual card licence updated. In the UK you can go online and with a code check the full details of a driving licence and can hire a car based on that as long as you also have photo ID.
Dimitris I wish it were that easy. I've lived in the UK for 15 years now but saw no reason to pay for a UK passport as it would give me next to no benefits of note.
HiThen the driving license together with the online document makes your driving license valid.Notice that you must have the driving license the online document and the passport with you all the time when you drive.https://www.gov.uk/driving-licence-codes
I think a new thread should be started for coronavirus updates

Anyone have an idea if it will be ok to fly to crete in the last few days of august? I have a feeling either Boris will impose a quarantine in the meantime or greece themselves will impose lockdown restrictions on the islands? Got my fingers crossed!
"We've all got all our fingers & toes crossed Emily. I would hope it'll be OK, I think it will. But no-one can promise. The numbers are increasing, as are the no of people in ICU. But Greece knew that would happen when they allowed the borders to open, for the economy's sake.So far the restrictions being imposed have held the numbers on the islands low, so let's hope that continues this next few weeks.it is possible - but at the moment only supposition (it's been leaked in several media outlets) - that the Greek Ministery may announce tomorrow a curfew from 11pm on all bars, cafes, restaurants, clubs, parties. Which would impact many people's holidays but help the crowding & social distancing issues that happen there."

There’s no way on earth I would risk going without first having a covid test before I go! 14 days in a quarantine hotel.. no thanks!
I see no point in going especially being from Sweden. There is a family of 5 from Sweden in a quarantine hotel they arrived last Friday so its home sweet home for now for us.
"Oh I see the point in going, life has to continue and I like going away! But I wouldn’t go without first taking a test as it would be just my luck to get picked for the testing!"
The problem with Covid19 and testing is that it doesn't mean you aren't going to develop it in the next few days.
"No it doesn’t but we’re just trying to minimise a positive result when we arrive in Greece. So we will get tested A few days before we go and then we will be staying in until we fly. If any of us test positive then we won’t go, can’t risk a 2 week lock up in a hotel!!!"

#195. Hi Mrssniffle. I certainly see the sense of a covid test before travelling but how can you guarantee the results will be back in time if the test has to be within 72hrs of travelling? FRom what I've read the home test kits would not be acceptable.
Oh sorry. I think I misunderstood. The test would be for your own peace of mind and not to present to the testers. Der !!!
"Greek health authorities announced 126 new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the country in the last 24 hours, 10 of which were imported infections detected at the country’s entry points"
Hi Maggie I live in one of the areas considered high risk - we get the result back same day or the next day.
https://www.iefimerida.gr/ellada/koronoios-1…
#202. Thanks Mrssniffle. I assume you can ask for a test because you live in a high risk area. We cant ask for one unless we have symptoms. So that would be quite an added expense for us. If Greece end up putting that restriction on the UK I've no idea what we'd do.
"The statement offering me greatest concern from the latest updates is the following; ""Passengers of flights from Bulgaria and Romania (as of Tuesday July 28th, 2020) and Malta (as of Wednesday August 12th, 2020 at 00.01 pm GMT+3) to Greece will be required to have a negative molecular test result (PCR) for COVID-19, performed up to 72 hours before their entry to Greece. This does not apply to Greek citizens, permanent residents of Greece and travelers for essential professional reasons. Travelers should be laboratory tested with RT-PCR of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab.Only travelers who carry a certificate of a negative RT-PCR test result will be allowed by the border authorities to enter the country. The certificates should be written in English and bear the name and passport/national ID number of the traveler.The Laboratories that perform the RT-PCR testing should be:National Reference laboratoriesNational Public Health Laboratories orPrivate laboratories which are accredited from the respective national accreditation authorities (not necessarily specifically for COVID-19).""As standard - the UK testing programme will not display our passport numbers. I am due to travel on August 29th however am now seriously considering changing as it looks ominous to suggest that further restrictions are imminently bound to be changed. I have until Friday to amend my flights for no cost."
"But the UK does not require that PCR as yet. If you are positive, IF tested in Crete you go to quarantine for 14 days."
"Greece infection per capita has risen again today to over 13, does anyone know what the rate was in Spain when the government added it to the all but essential travel list?"
"Where the 126 new cases are located:10 cases during the checks carried out at the entrance gates of the country,- 26 imported cases, of which 17 were detected in immigrants who arrived in Mytilene.- 38 cases in P.E. Attica, at least half of whom had close contact with a confirmed case or history of recent travel within the country.- 18 cases in P.E. Thessaloniki, of which more than half had close contact with a confirmed case.- 1 case in P.E. Boeotia,- 2 cases in P.E. Dodecanese,- 1 case in P.E. Evros,- 3 cases in P.E.

Finland will now introduce fines or prison time for people who don't go into self-isolation when they travel from high risk covid countries.
#207 it was 27.4 - although I'm not 100% sure how it's all worked out as other countries have been/are higher and still not on the 'naughty list'. There must be other criteria being considered.
Political.
"Tourist from the Netherlands need a negative test from August 17th. We will travel August the 20th. Test cost € 89,50 per person. Waiting for a response of the Dutch Government and travel organizations. They are held responsible for traveling with the proper test results. They won't be happy. If you booked a cheap package trip for the whole family (and that is very easy now) you have to pay € 90,00 extra p.p. I do understand the reason but the consequences are great. If the Government put Greece on code orange for this new rules traveling will not be allowed or you have to ga back immediately with extra costs as well. No insurance will cover a stay in a orange code country. We have to reconsider our stay unfortunately. Waiting for a response from Dutch Government next days."
I agree I do think there are some political reasons don’t know what though.
Just got off a packed flight to Chania from Gatwick. Allowed through pretty quickly and neither of us tested. Got to be honest I wasn’t happy with them ramming the plane full but at least we’re here!
"Greece one of last options for a European holiday, so it's now going to be most popular. I noticed that extra flights from Gatwick to Heraklion are now available"

The figures for Greece are still tiny compared to the peaks in most other European countries. I don't blame the Greek government for applying stricter entry conditions. They may continue to leave the UK off the list because they know tests here are almost impossible to get.
"""They may continue to leave the UK off the list because they know tests here are almost impossible to get.""In most places in the UK you are able to get a free walk-in or drive-in test on the same day. Results usually within 48 hours. Not sure where you get this information from."

"The new 262 cases:85 in Thessaloniki: 36 of them are related to the cluster of the nursing home.66 in Attica: 14 of them linked to travel inside the country.11 in Magnisia: 7 of them related to clusters8 in HalkidikiEach 7 in Xanthi, and PellaEach 5 in Larissa, PIeria and Serres4 in FlorinaEach 3 in Imathia, Kastoria, Lakonia, CycladesEach 2 in Arkadia and HeraklioEach 1 in Aitoloakarnania, Grevena, Drama, Evia, Ilia, Kozani, Corfu, Kefalonia, Kilkis, Corinth, Evros, Lasithi, Preveza, Trikala."
The person working in the care home may have been asymptomatic like most people are! Doubt he/she would have done it deliberately . That’s quite an assertion

It’s not an assertion is just a opinion...they may well have been asymptomatic and I suppose we don’t really know the circumstances surrounding it so perhaps I jumped the gun. It’s just that we are all all being urged to take personal responsibility in these times and so many people don’t.
Thanks for the link Jock.
"I live in Lanzarote and am flying to Dublin on 22nd August and then onto Crete on the 23rd and understand I need to have a negative PCR test done within 72 hours to enter Crete, every doctor I have spoken to say that the results take 48-72 hours to come back, does anyone have any ideas how I can make this work?"
"Today we announce 204 new cases of the new virus in the country, of which 12 were detected after checks at the country's gateways.

So for a little perspective around 1.47% of the 204 cases were actually in Crete.

Boris can be unpredictable but at least he is not afraid to do the necessary. We can only hope that Greece can avoid the horror story that visitors to France no find themselves in.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/1…
Hi RaduOur local MP Danny Kruger has agreed with us that mistakes have been made but he assures us that our government will not be afraid to act swiftly if they deem measures like quarantine necessary.
"Hi Lucy,And do you trust him? People trusted them early March too and we can all see the outcome. Don’t want to make this a political discussion but from a healthcare professional point of view I can say that unfortunately we didn’t learn anything. And I won’t be surprised if Greece will soon ask us too for a test before entering the country."
^our government will not be afraid to act swiftly ^ Wow- talk about locking the door after the horse has bolted ! You sound like a true blue Tory who's prepared to defend the party whatever happens !
Hi Mingalabarchris Just repeating the words of our MP and I'm not even close to any type of blue! We would just love to be able to take off to Crete right now but things are getting worse instead of better. We do remain positive for next year though.
"@255, don't forget the relative populations... 200 in 10M vs 1000 in 67M. But I'm still hopeful for a cheeky week in October..."
Things will settle down in Greece end of this month with less locals on the move.
"@steve: I agree, the number of daily new cases per capita is pretty similar when comparing UK to Greece. But there is a difference in approach: Greece is brining in new restrictions like the midnight closure of bars while we decide to open casinos and bowling. Hope to be in Crete in 2 week but if I could I would go today as God knows how the situation will be in 2 weeks time."
"#262 - the reason Greece is bringing in new restrictions like midnight bar closures is because people are ignoring social distancing rules etc. The UK has introduced increased local restrictions where necessary. Opening up casinos and bowling - like anything else - shouldn't be an issue if social distancing and other hygiene measures are followed. Most issues/flare ups are caused not by the rules or relaxing the rules - it's the people that don't follow them!Edited: 4:26 am, August 14, 2020 "
@263: the local restrictions are a joke because nobody is enforcing them. And the same applies to any other rules:- probably 50% of the people are wearing a mask in the shops and nobody cares- staff in restaurants and bars don’t collect info for track &trace; they are not following any infection control rules not use any sort of PPE- track & trace reaches only 70% of contacts- people coming from countries which are subject to quarantine are not checked; I personally know someone who came from Spain and in 2 weeks of home isolation was not contacted or checked even once
"#264 - you prove my point perfectly ... this is down to the behaviour of individuals.Edited: 4:52 am, August 14, 2020 "
@265: it is of course the individuals but then someone have to step in and make the individuals follow the rules. You can’t expect that during a pandemic people will just use their common sense (which is lacking for lots of them).
"Does anyone know what the number of cases per 100,000 has to be in greece before Boris imposes a 14 day quarantine? The numbers for france,spain,belgium etc so far all seem to be very different which makes it difficult to predict if greece is nearing a quarantine announcement?"
"#267 I think it's when cases hit 20 per 100,000"
"I think they have decided if the 14 day figure reaches 20 cases per 100,000 and it stays like that for 7 days, the UK will impose quarantine.Am I right I’m thinking Greece is sitting around 17/18 per 100,000 currently? I’m quickly losing hope that my holiday to Greece will go ahead in late August."
"# see here: https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaGreece over 18 today. Sadly, I think I must kiss goodbye to my Zante holday on 28/8"
"91 cases in Crete now, sadly.Expecting another announcement later today from the Greek Gov't, possibly further restrictions coming. They are asking, again, for young people to abide by the protocols."
"Me too I fly to Greece on the 19th and I think based on Spain, France ect the quarantine will be introduced when I’m there. Flying with Ryanair so 0 chance of any money back"
"We are meant to be flying next week too and while I think we would make it out there, i'll fully expect to be in quarantine by the time i get back. 91 cases in Crete, that's so sad. I just feel really sad that's it's a lot of young people all over the world who have zero regard for the rules and are spreading this virus far and wide."
"Also, if they add in new restriction similar to Poros with maximum gatherings of 9, what would that mean if you had a villa holiday booked for 10? That you could no longer go?"
">>>Greece over 18 today. Sadly, I think I must kiss goodbye to my Zante holday on 28/8ECDC counts cumulative cases/100,000 over 14-day period, not 7-day period as the UK! Another website posted that the current 7-day count in Greece is 11.6"
"It’s not looking good, I would like to hope things could improve and maybe once these new measures have had a chance to work we might see an improvement in the figures. Trying to hold on to some positivity but it’s getting harder to do that given all the latest."
I don't think it's confined to young people.It is people in general . Think most of the population are either dim or selfish.We will still travel if possible and put up with quarantine afterwards.
"I’m so confused by all this...I understood it was the 14 day figure that the UK based there quarantine rules/decisions by? If things are potentially better than I thought, that would be great news!"
A guy from the Financial Times on bbc news channel is saying that the U.K. base it on 7 days and the threshold over 7 days seems to be 20. He predicted and wrote about france being taken off based on this. So where is the data for 7 days I wonder????
"I understand the UK makes decisions on quarantine based on a 7-day period. At least that's what the media say. 14-day=18.5 cases/100,0007-day= 11.6 cases/100,000 It's not simply 18.5 divided by 2 because the recent spikes in Greece occurred in the last week"
That’s interesting do you have a link for this data please so that I can track it? I won’t be travelling if it gets close.
14-day data is on the ECDC website (updated every day around early afternoon) https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaFor 7-day numbers you have to follow UK sources as most of the EU are using ECDC's 14-day data as reference and don't normally calculate 7-day data.
Thank you yes I follow the ecdc and as you say it’s 14 day data. The U.K. sources for 7 data sounds good do you have a link please because when we google we aren’t coming up with anything at all for 7 days!
"OK so the 7 day rate is 11.6 and it has to reach 20 and remain above 20 for a further 7 days before being removed from the ""safe"" list? Is that correct or massively wrong?"
I can’t find anywhere that gives the 7 day figure but it is what was deemed to be a determining factor by the FT journalist this morning. Although as we know that could quickly change!
"Thanks for that info, I will be looking at that from now on... i understand that it will be greater than the 11 figure due a recent spike but it’s definitely an improvement on 18. Fingers crossed we see a positive change in figures or at least not a surge."
the 11 figure is only for one weekhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
11 is not an improvement on 18 because 18 in 14 days is better than 11 in 7 days:)
yes if figures remains the same this coming week it will be around 24.0
I’ve resigned myself to not going on the 19th and I think the rate going up in EU destinations plays right in to the government hands
But I still can’t locate a scientific 7 day average!

"People are using the 20/100,000 as a bench mark for Boris to impose UK quarantine 14 day self isolation but many countries are well over this threshold now and still not obliged to self isolate on return."
@316: do you have an example? I’ve randomly checked a couple of other countries and I couldn’t find one that is over that 20 threshold.
https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea.Had a very quick scan through this list at least 3 countries above 20 at moment who are not on current list.
My fear is that the reopening of schools will trigger closed borders. The Minister for Transport hinted at this on Radio4 this morning. I really think this is the risk rather than the quarantine threat. We will lose our holiday in Crete at the end of the month if this happens. There seems to be no desire to enable travel abroad and more of the opposite really. To put a stop to it because of a general risk averse culture in the UK.My husband and I have had covid and recovered in May so we are keen to get back to enjoying life . I am glad we travelled as much as we could in the past when we could and really fear that this ability is gone forever.
"1,362 new cases in total this week after taking into account today's figures, divided by 7 that's an average of just under 195 daily new cases in the last 7 days. As others have calculated this works out to be around 13.08 per 100,000 based on the last 7 days.If the average daily cases rises to 300 ( x 7 = 2,100 cumulative), this equates to roughly 20.2 per 100,000. For the number to be kept below 20 cases per 100,000 based on the 7 day calculation then essentially the number of daily new cases needs to be kept well below 300. There are various other factors so this doesn't necessarily guarantee travel quarantine decisions."
"@318: ECDC uses 14 days cumulative while we seem to use 7 days. This leads to completely different values. For example, Poland’s 14 days is 24.9 while the 7 days one is 13.13."
"well if its the 7 days we need to focus on, thats good. w also gon on the 19th august to Corfu. its certainly squeaky bum time. if the government does quatrain every Saturday. I'm hoping it will be 2 weeks tomo. somebody cleve can surely work out the average rise in cases. and if that continues at the same rate. when the government will apply quarantinegoodluck, everyone. stay safe. ."
@maggie m yeah its countrywise the restrictions so hope for the best. We were to fly today but still at home. Flights cancelled.
"Estonia starts the bad news:Estonia:14-day quarantine applies to travellers from Luxembourg, Spain, Romania, Andorra, Malta, Monaco, Belgium, San Marino, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Sweden, France, Iceland, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Portugal, Denmark, Poland, Croatia, Cyprus, Austria, Greece and Ireland.Starting from next week, the restriction on freedom of movement will not apply to people travelling to Estonia if they arrive from the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Germany, Liechtenstein, Italy, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, Hungary, Finland and the Vatican."
"It’s 20 per 100k over a 7 day period. For Greece with a population of 10.7m that is a cumulative of 2,140 people in a week. If you follow the 7 moving average which is 181 today it will need to reach at least 305 for it to trigger a quarantine in the UK. I think it is 50:50 this will be reached within the next couple of weeks. It depends on how the numbers react to the changes the Greek government made over the last week or so."
Yeah I agree. If it continues at this rate. We prob got until sat 29th. But like you say. If the curfew is working and cases drop. We could be ok for another month or so. Because people with kids will have to stop going last week In August. So that will see a drop in uk travelers. Important week next week for Greece. Some great stats and good messages. It’s been an education. Cheers.
I’m flying out to Crete tomorrow on BA. Just got my QR code. Number starts with 4 so probably won’t get tested going by what others have suggested about the number.
"I've been waiting patiently to rebook to go to Crete for mid-September but it looks as though I will miss out.If numbers continue to rise at the current rate, Greece will probably turn red in the next 14 days.With the UK levelling off in numbers for the virus, lets hope its the start of of decline across Europe.Edited: 7:19 am, August 15, 2020 "

"I know, I am hoping that some of the new measures implemented will start to take effect and less cases are announced daily."
"It has now also reached the 20 per 100,000 mark for 14 day average - the figure seems to be moving fast"

"I'm supposed to arrive on Sept 8th. I live in Canada so I'll have to quarantine when I get back home no matter what. What are the odds Greece does a total shutdown in Sept? I just don't want to get stuck there, although I'll have my work laptop with me just in case."
Uk government only interested in 7 day rolling average. So it’s less then 20. Think it’s about 15 Ish at the moment. Prob got 2 weeks before a quarantine if the daily rate continues upwards.
"7 day cumulative average was 13 yesterday.Edited: 8:55 am, August 15, 2020 "

It’s easy just go from the 7 day average and divide by 305 and then x 20. Gives you 12.7 currently.

@panditjidenmark it needs to be 40 per 100k over 14 days to be of concern.
"That's 230 today,https://www.tanea.gr/2020/08/15/greece/koronaios-stin-ellada-230-nea-krousmata-kai-treis-thanatoi-to-teleytaio-24oro/"
@352: France and Portugal are not over 40 so the threshold seems to be more like 20.
@Ahldn ok
"France's 7 day figure is 21.8 (not including today's figures which I can't find yet) rising from about 15 the week before.Portugal has always been a strange one. I think it may only have been included partly because the borders between Spain and Portugal are very 'porous', by which I mean you can for instance fly into Faro and holiday in Spain. Portugal's 7 day figure is only 14, though it was over 20 about a month ago."
Anyone take a punt on odds of travelling Newcastle/ heraklion 18th August?
I am sure you will fly but then if Boris does what they did for France then thats the tricky one.From Finland the next review will be mid next week or end next week.
"#341 Thanks very much I will keep an eye out.I've been following the 14 day cumulative number, it updates everyday and has been going up around 2 per day.If it continues on its current trend it will be in the 30s by the end of the coming week and 40s the following week.My holiday from work is not til mid -September so hoping for a down turn so I can get away to Crete, but not looking hopeful."
"We will wait and see how it goes, https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/travel/g…"
"We've just booked for 23.10 as we're unable to travel before then. Hopefully the current spike in Greece will level and they'll welcome late season business. Will reschedule if they quarantine arrivals but will keep my fingers crossed. If the UK quarantined arrivals from Greece on the return, will be ok as our office is not re-opening until January, so will just work at home and stay in for 14 days."
On the Skiathos thread Yorkshiremouth has a very reasoned case for quarantine starting on 29th September.
You mean 29th August.
"Sorry, yes I do. My bad."
Hoping for some advice - I have moved my flights with ryanair to a week earlier (22nd) but i have already filled out the PLF forms - should i make a new one or edit the one i already have? i don’t want the edits to get lost in the system somewhere or not updated but also don’t know if filling out multiple forms is allowed?
No problem to fill out a new one. You need one with the correct date so don't take the risk.
Does someone know how many people are in hospitals/IC at Crete and what is the capacity. Bit worried about the new numbers of cases.
let's not forget that Crete has 650.000 inhabitants (now probably a bit more due to tourists) and has had 1-3 cases per day with a spike to 8 today. That's still very very low compared to the number of ppl living there. I don't think the worry is about hospitals being over capacity in Crete. The worry also shouldn't be about catching the virus in Crete. It's summer. You're outside. You can dine outside. The risk is almost certainly much lower than in most European countries and cities. The worry is more about mandatory quarantines or mandatory paid PCR tests in our respective countries upon return. I'm flying from Vienna on the 23rd of August and I'll stay for 10 days. I'm positive that all will be fine and hope that there won't be quarantine upon return.
"Thanks AG M. I am positive as well only wondering about the COVID capacity in hospitals at Crete. Tomorrow we will have the necessary PCR test so we can fly Thursday morning. I know most positive tested people are not in the hospital but i can imagine with a lot of older people at Crete there are more people in the hospital than in the Netherlands. Indeed we will live outside at Crete and avoid the larger cities. No problem for we love the small villages. Of course we will wear the masks, keep distance etc."
""" i can imagine with a lot of older people at Crete there are more people in the hospital than in the Netherlands.""You can't be serious! Crete has a little over 600.000 inhabitants and the Netherlands 18 millions.Crete's ICU capacity is around 60, or at least it was around the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. So on a per inhabitant basis it's more or less like the Netherlands, maybe marginally better"

I get 13.5 too.Hopefully it starts to level out and doesn't tip the 300 figure

"Hi all. I’ve been following this thread with interest, particularly as we are booked to travel to Crete on 30th August! Is there anyone who is travelling to Greece at a similar time to us? If so how confident are you that your and our trip will go ahead? Just wondering how everyone else is feeling! If the UK introduces measures in which we will need to quarantine on return to the UK will we still be fine to go on our holiday (quarantine on arrival home is no problem for us as we are working from home)"
"I admit that I am not feeling very confident about it and have not been since Spain was removed.I do not think that the UK government wants to allow or enable any leisure travel abroad. Our hotels are now fully paid up and asking to move them to next summer is all that we can do. We will wait until we know for sure. I suspect a blanket travel ban is on it's way to coincide with the opening of schools. I don't think it will be ""just"" quarantine."
IMHO these number will start to fall very shortly. But Crete having 24 cases in a day looks bad. Also note from all the cases not even 10 % is from foreign tourists.
#381 Is that new cases in Crete?I think they may drop too. I fly out on 28th....feel fairly confident that I will get out there. But I think the goalposts could move once in Greece with regards to UK decision.
Yes today 24 new cases 10 in Iraklion and 12 in Chania
"""Also note from all the cases not even 10 % is from foreign tourists.""Which is not surprising. This is the peak Greek holiday time and there are probably 10 times more Greek tourists in Crete right now than there are foreigners.Yes, after next week when the Greek holiday season is more or less over the numbers should drop IF various measures have been followed and Covid-19 has not spread to the Cretan local population"
"@lacey16, I'm in the same situation as you. Due to fly into Chania on the 31st from Ireland, our green list is being updated on Tuesday so waiting to see what will happy. Still confident in going if we have to quarantine as I'm also working from home but I am worried Greece may close their borders again. Apparently there is due to be an update on the 23rd, praying we can still get there and home again!"
Greece will not close its borders if the country in question from where you are coming does not have crazy amount of cases.
"Hi,We are flying out in early September and like you any future UK quarantine will not affect us greatly. What we need are the flights to continue and the tavernas and supermarkets to be open.We do not have a problem with going against UK FCO advice not to travel.Edited: 1:58 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"@Leonie > Still confident in going if we have to quarantine as I'm also working from home but I am worried Greece may close their borders again.The bigger concern with your home country imposing quarantine is the likelihood of airlines cancelling flights if demand evaporates due to lots of people cancelling.I am in the same boat, due to fly 2nd September from England. I don't think Greece will shut its borders but if the UK does impose quarantine I am worried my flight will get cancelled and leave me with no trip."
"@will who are you flying with? I'm booked with Ryanair, they seem to still be operating flights to places like Malta and Spain that aren't on our green list. If they cancel the flight they will give you a refund or voucher for the cost of your flight. I'm not sure about other airlines though, fingers crossed we won't have to worry about it and we can just get there!

Only a few of the places in Agia Marina and Platanias are closed. Just spoke to a hotel owner friend in Agia Marina he is full till the 25th of August.
"Oh that's good! Thanks for the update on this, I was out off booking agia marina by someone else who is over there but this is reassuring"
"The hotel I was referring to is Akatos hotel right in the center of Agia Marina. Besider the hotel they have a cafe bar open from 8 am to midnight. There is many places like that but ofcourse not all open. Finland tour operators TUI, suntours Thomas cook.... fly 3 times a week to Chania with most bookings for Agia Marina and Platanias. So thats atleast 1500 people a week you wont be alone. Lol."

26 Greeks or tourists ?
"Greece is currently having more cases on days now than it ever did, even including from the start of the outbreak. Its own minister has formally announced it's in a second wave so restrictions are inevitable surely from the UK side. The highest ever cases in greece was only recorded this week"

"KalisperaA significant increase in the daily confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Crete, was announced by EODY today. Of the 217 new cases across the country, 26 are in Crete and specifically, fourteen in Chania, ten in Heraklion and one each in Rethymno and Lassithi. Thus, the total number of confirmed cases on the island reached 129 from the begening of the epidemic.Even so, it is still beyond the reach of the average person.The authorities constantly point out the need to use a protective mask indoors, but also where there is congestion.In the meantime, the police checks continued on the day of Panagia, in order to observe the measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.The director of the TEZ group today expressed his dissatisfaction because the same measures are taken in Crete with so few cases as in Athens and Thessaloniki that the epidemic data is much more.Edited: 3:41 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"Just from observation, perhaps if there were a system beyond ‘everyone wear a mask’ then the cases wouldn’t rise as steeply. The midnight curfew is enforced but people are allowed to cram in on public transport, distancing is enforced in very few places and it most certainly is not just tourists who are negligent."
"Kalimera, Dimitris.When you say ""it is still beyond the reach of the average person"" do you mean that the cases in Crete are contained and are away from the tourists?"

"I think we all made a very simple mistake when calculating the cumulative 7 days rolling average per 100.000. I say this because I think we have to use 7 values which are also 7 day averages. For example, let’s say that the 7 day average on day 1 is X1 on day 2 is X2 and so on.You will then have (X1+....X7)/population*100.000Without today’s data this would leave Greece at 12.08.To calculate the average for day 1, the 7-day moving average will average out the number of cases for the last seven days. In calculating for day 2, we will remove the first data point and add the value for the 8th day, to continue with the calculation of the moving average.Please feel free to correct me if you have a different opinion as I am by no mean a statistics expert.Edited: 5:40 pm, August 17, 2020 "
"This is how I work it out.I look at the 7 day average figure, I get it from here but note it is often one day behind:https:/…Look at the number of cases graph and toggle on the 7 day average.So today's (16/08) 7 day average is 207.So in the last 7 days there have been 207x7=1449 cases. To convert that to cases per 100000, multiply by 100000 then divide by the population of Greece, 10,410,000 approx according to that website, though others quote it marginally higher. So, 1449 x 100000 divide by 10410000. Giving a figure of 13.91.But as I've said previously, the benchmark for reaching 20/100000 on 7 day cumulative cases is that Greece will be showing a 7 day average of 300 new cases a day. Currently nowhere near that, but as we can see, things can change.For info., the current Greece 14 day figure is 22.5 (possibly 1 day forward from the 7 day figure, as it includes 17/08). That tells you that the 7 day figure for the previous week would have been about 8.5. As long as it doesn't keep rising, and the last couple of days have been quite positive, then the 7 day figure should stay less than 20"

Thanks for your sensible reply to that WitchHazel.I understand the concern that the cases have risen from yesterday - I think that was expected but still puts a slight dampener on things. But I do think far too many people are jumping the gun and getting ahead of themselves. There is no reason to panic yet.
@steve: I use worldometers too but I think that multiplying the last available day by 7 it’s not really right and this will lead to an artificially increased number of cases. From what I can remember from my medical statistics lessons and from what I’ve read if you want to calculate a cumulative 7 days average you then need to use the moving average for all those days included.
Me too!!!

Re post 432. Please state your source/website link. Most of us on the Greek Travel Forum pages know that it's nowhere near that figure yet. It will require an average number of daily new cases of about 300 over a 7 day period to get anywhere near the figure that you are quoting.

Finland decides tonight on Greece. 14 day quarantine is the max. they can do.Maybe they spare Greece as we have tons of tourists in Rhodes and Crete.
Any guesses if the UK will have added greece to the quarantine list by Saturday? Meant to fly saturday morning but not feeling hopeful having read some predictions
Do you think the UK and Ireland will be added to the list of countries that need to have a negative covid test 72 hours prior to entering Greece?
@panditjidenmark If Finland do leave Greece off the list then it is likely because they are differentiating between the mainland and the islands. There are barely any cases in the islands (most at least).
"Yes and we have no flights to the mainland run by Finnish airlines or tour operators. Its just Rodos, Kos and Crete for now. 3-4 cases a day a total of 130 cases on Crete is nothing. I think they are being stupid and just over strict."
I’m the same. Need to decide tomorrow if I’m cancelling hotel and car hire or will need to pay full price. Stressing!
"There is a lot a speculation about quarantine/travel advisory. None of us knows, and it seems the experts don't know either. I read in a news article today (but I can't find it), that one statistical modeller in Greece suggests cases will remain around 200 per day, whereas another puts it rising to 700 within a month. They can't both be right. It all depends on what assumptions are made. I am not cancelling my 1 September flight and accommodation and I am keeping my fingers crossed that the optimistic modeller is closer to the truth."
@447 I do agree there is way too much speculation. The only reason that I tend to sway towards the ones who think quarantine will come within the next couple of weeks is because I went to spain last month and was reading all the same kind of speculation and 4 days after my return it did happen. And with so many people now flocking to greece whose spain holidays have been cancelled is only making the situation worse in my opinion
"Suggests cases will remain around 200 per day, Arnaki_13 Its well over 200 already steadily going up ."
"KalimeraPost 444 ""3-4 cases a day a total of 130 cases on Crete is nothing.""I am surprised that nobody says that 130 cases are from the beginning of the epidemic and that means that is not possible all of them to be active.So in my opinion we don't have more than 30 or 40 active cases.Edited: 11:59 pm, August 18, 2020 "

Internal border control will be restored to traffic between Finland and Iceland, Greece, Malta, Germany, Norway and Denmark.External border traffic control will be restored for traffic from Ireland, Cyprus and San Marino to Finland, and for Japanese residents for traffic from Japan to Finland.Travel to these countries is not recommended and there is a recommendation for voluntary quarantine when returning from the countries. The restrictions will take effect next Monday, August 24th."
@panditjidenmark This is promising for the UK at least for a week or 2 after this date. As Finland has such a low threshold for the restrictions.

Greece is what matters and the cases there IF you are going there. Finland and Norway stopped travel not because of their own cases of corona but due to Greece.
Is there any place where I could find corona statistics in Greece islands? I mean how many cases are found for example in Crete dailybasis or weekly basis? I have managed to find only statistics for whole Greece but that information is useless as for example Athens is so far away from for example Chania and most cases are in Athens.
There is a daily report on what places in Greece new cases are from. See above in this thread panditji always posts them

Think from what I hear as long as the cases stay below 300 per day everything should be fine regards quarantine. I’ve just over 2 weeks to go so it’s gonna be a long wait to see what happens.
Portugal added to the travel corridor is reassuring as it has very similar numbers comparing to Greece. Almost same population and almost the same 7 day rolling average number of new cases. The only difference is the trend.

Croatia has less cases than Greece
@ThisPlus87 Austria are at 20.7
@panditjidenmark They have population that is nearly 60% smaller so no surprise they went on the list.
"AHLDN - you're correct, the latest figures actually did take it past 20 and not under as I initially thought. I've just removed my post to avoid any confusion."
so watching sky news and it appears greece hasn't been added to this weeks quarantine list. So excited to fly to greece on Sunday now! We fly back the Friday after as we can't risk quarantine so looks like we are safe!
"According to Manolis Dermitzakis, professor of Genetics, there are currently up to 15,000 people in Greece who do not know they are infected.""The main problem is that there are a lot of asymptomatic and especially young people and of course they are a source of the virus that can infect those around them,"" he said. According to Mr. Dermitzakis, the fact that the cases range in numbers from 150 to 250 means that we have stabilization, and this implies a stable transmission and not an increased one.More intense is the concern for the behavior of young people who in recent days have become a ""hotbed of transmission"" counting the largest percentage of total cases in our country.According to EODY data, since the beginning of the pandemic in our country, 429 children and adolescents have been diagnosed with the virus. The three-digit numbers of cases recorded in recent days have alarmed experts, as 5 out of 10 concern young people under the age of 40.At the same time, the rapid rise in cases is beginning to put pressure on the health system."
Just read an article in some foreign press about 2 confirmed Covid positive people who attended a 500 people party in Mykonos...I was hopeful that this whole situation would make us better but it seems to have the opposite effect.
They’ve significantly cracked down on Mykonos so we should see a notable downturn of numbers from that island over the coming days.
I don’t understand why U.K. citizens are so blatantly flouting the FCO advice to NOT travel... Stay home and stop spreading the virus...So many similarities with the way Americans behave...
"@Bolero The FCO does not have such advice for Greece. Greece is currently on the travel corridor list.Edited: 3:21 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"AHLDN,Troll! Please don't feed them."
@Bolero: maybe people need a nice beach holiday. Some of us worked in healthcare/retail/public services or other high risk jobs throughout all these months. As much as I like a British holiday from time to time this is not what I need now.
"@BoleroYou are spreading false information, almost certainly with deliberate intent. What do you hope to gain from trolling?"
@Adonis77 I don't think this is helpful. There are lots of asymptomatic people in all countries and this is the danger of the virus. If everyone had a fever/cough then it would be easy to find these people and isolate them.
"@ boleroFrom Gov.uk:""Coronavirus (COVID-19): countries and territories exempt from advice against ‘all but essential’ international travelGreece is included in this ^^^^ list so NO UK U.K. citizens are so blatantly flouting the FCO advice to NOT travel.There's a thread on the Greek board asking people to get their facts straight.Maybe take note of that and do not post inaccurate information."
Will be interesting to see what numbers come out today. The 7 day ma for Greece has flattened a lot. Also this time last week we had some of the biggest numbers so today we will be displacing those.
Todays figure will knock off 251 new cases from 14/8 so any number lower than that will be a positive step.

Re reply #505I think the UK government WILL take the numbers reported - regardless of what they are - over complaints and allegations.
"When deciding whether to travel for a holiday to Crete, it is now time to seriously consider more than just the QR code/ potential quarantine on return issue.https://www.apokoronaslife.gr/?p=76099To precis: ""The testimony of a young man just 22 years old who suffers from coronavirus is revealing.Dimitris & his 4 friends went to Chania for 5 days holiday, plenty of socialising. On returning home they all had corona-virus symptoms & have tested positive.They have now been quarantined to prevent further transmission of the virus as much as possible.Several new cases every day now, with many discussions locally by Cretans about the latest 'conspiracy theory' (my designation of it), which could well be true - that there are far higher numbers of cases in the last couple of weeks than are being reported, for the sake of tourism."
"@SteveSitia The UK spot checks people coming back from foreign countries. This is why Spain was put on the quarantine list suddenly after 10 people tested positive. If cases are high and the UK is importing them they will make it known.Edited: 10:44 am, August 21, 2020 "
"Haha, spot checks? If you are unlucky they might call your mobile phone. You can be at the pub but say that you are home..."
@Radu A They spot check people at airports. This is exactly why Spain got on the quarantine list suddenly. https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/1…
"The article doesn't mention spot checks at the airport. These people could have developed symptoms shortly after returning and gone for the test. I can see that a cluster of cases from holidaymakers would have an impact on decision-making along with other factors, such as the rate of spread, but there is no confirmation in this article."
@Arnaki That was during the interview with Whitty. Regardless they spot checked and found they were importing cases so Spain got blocked. It isn’t happening with Greece
"@Radu - Thanks. In that case, I am pleased to hear there is some spotting checking taking place."
"I know a couple of people who came from abroad, only one of them was checked over the phone and only once."
209 cases today so good news
"yes 209 new cases of the new virus in the country, of which 11 were detected following checks at the country's gateways."

"Spot checks, and even checking that the form has been filled in, would be appear to be very hit and miss at UK airports.

204. That takes the 7 day rolling average down to 14.1
Worldmeters 3 dead and newcases 204
"Yes. Good news on case numbers today, although the news in more deaths is very sad.Radu - Sorry I realise I wasn't replying to you but to AHLDN, in my earlier comment."
The trend is good I think by end of this month is should be down to the 50-60 mark
"How is this false? UK gov advises against travel overseas. If you cared to read about it on the FCO site, you would clearly see it."

Maggie also keep your eye on truus's thread as she has started a great up to date/live trip report https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189… x
I’m feeling more optimistic that my trip will happen next week. So much so that I learnt the Greek alphabet today and a few polite phrases!Will get started on the packing list tomorrow. My mother thinks I’m an idiot but hey ho....
Cheers Jock. Ive been looking at that thread. Ive just said on another post that I am now allowing myself to get a teeny bit excited. :-))
Yeah numbers are not too bad at the minute. Can’t see quarantine being imposed as the average numbers are still quite low. I think they are doing a good job and hope it continues. We visit in 2 weeks so hoping numbers get even lower.
"Good EveningAs I have said before, Crete has 650.000 thousand inhabitants and we have just passed the 2.000.000 million tourists since the first of July, so the number of cases is negligible.The success of the island against the spread of the covid 19 is indisputable and irreversible."
Crossing all fingers for you maggie (and everyone else who has decided to travel) x
I know you a few not so polite words as well AmoMondo if you need them haha (and at times I have bitten my fingers on this forum so as not to use them lol).
"Thanks Jock. 3 weeks on Thursday!!!. And with Grant Shapps now implying differentiating between Spain and the Islands, one can hope he may do the same with Greece if necessary. What a rollercoaster of a year!!!!"
I’m hoping to be so happy and relaxed that I won’t need rude or impolite words when there. I know what you mean about TA though.....
"Just wanted to say thanks to all the forum regulars for keeping this thread going - it's been a real help to see the figures and read the discussion (both positive and negative). We are due to fly out to Chania on Friday morning and I'm taking it as a good sign that my current main stress is the confusing advice from easyJet about the PLF (they say one form per household but each member needs an individual code). I'm obviously still keeping a close eye on numbers, but feeling optimistic.Looking forward to being back in beautiful Crete very soon (fingers crossed - taking nothing for granted yet!)"
Here's hoping if it is needed and it sure has been maggie. I am sure you won't need them in Crete AmoMondo and you will get the same warm welcome and hospitality as always from the Cretan's :-))

"@Jane, where are your sourcing that from? According to Worldometer, the daily case number has not exceeded 250 on any day since the 14th when it peaked at 251.I wish people would cite their sources when sharing this information so it can be verified, otherwise, people will tend to feel it's misleading."
"Just a very quick update - we arrived home last night after a wonderful 4 weeks in Crete. We were very apprehensive about going (about a week before departure we’d decided to stay at home!) but we’re so glad that we made the decision to go. We felt very safe while we were there. Beaches, villages etc seemed much quieter than usual, although the tavernas seemed quite busy. Social distancing overall was very good - it’s just a shame that people seem to forget about it all at the airport! Roll on summer 2021!"
Look forward to reading the updates Sophie. Safe travels and have an amazing time.
@Jane Z - 555 - not sure where you are getting your facts from. The figures quoted for yesterday were 243 cases and 2 deaths. This will give a rolling 7 day average under 15. This has been fairly consistent so the chances of not hitting the red list still remain pretty good.

#567. Thank you Pandit. So just to clarify. Thats a total of 168 cases in Crete since the start of the pandemic. Dimitris tells us there's a population of 650.000 and already 2.000.000 tourists have entered Crete. I draw my own conclusions

Hi all. Landed last night. There was around 3-4 planes came in at the same time and only seen one person get pulled for testing. Looks like it’s not random in terms of they just pick who they want it’s all to do with the codeI was worrying before we flew like mad incase we were a carrier of Covid with day no symptoms.suppose it’s the risk you take The standards out here are better than uk tbh.. streets ahead of the uk I would say. Good luck to anyone flying out

"@maggie m Yes, that is the total 168 cases in Crete since the start of the pandemic. Its good but with corona we never what's not detected. I would go to Crete but not to North of Greece or Athens.Greece does not look good but Crete does."
Thats the conclusion I reached. Fingers crossed it doesnt get much worse

"The number of coronavirus cases in Greece remains high, increasing also the possibility for additional stricter measures. 4,033 infections have been recorded alone from August 1 to August 22, while the number of new cases reached over 1,500 in the last week (August 16-22.) .https:/…"

Hi any of the stats folk know how we may be looking to go on 5th sept ? Seemed a bit high today but my rubbish maths suggests that it would take 14 days at 300 to tip the balance ?
"If the numbers shoot us to over 300 over each of 7 consecutive days you are looking at a rate of 20+. You have just under two weeks so it might happen anytime from 7 days hence. Like us, keep your fingers crossed for low 200s and less.Edited: 12:51 pm, August 23, 2020 "
The next week would be the one to watch then
Hi is there any breakdown as to which areas these 66 cases are located. It's quite a jump!
"Oh dear, I won't be recommending Sougia for the next few weeks then:Some Cretan friends suspect this could be why Chania region is getting more than its 'fair share' of new cases, sadly.https:/…"
#583 Could some kindly soul please translate SteveSitia's link.
@maggie m It is talking about parties and people not following guidance. I must admit having come from Heraklion last week to Chania this week they are definitely a lot more lax with the rules in Chania in comparison.
Can you please post how many cases on Crete today?
#585. AHLDN. Thanks for that. Hoping to fly to Heraklion on September 17th. My nerves are all over the place!:-)
"Sorry Maggie.It's saying there are daily illegal beach parties in Sougia.It translates as:""Beach Party like the Good old Days. In the middle of corona:The port of Sougia becomes a daily place to hold a ""party"" as at least residents of the region of Sougia note.As people at Flashnews even point out, ""no one is concerned with our health. These images are a daily occurrence.""It is clear that young people want to ""get away"" from all this current situation, however, when protective measures are not taken, at this critical time, then things are even dangerous.It is no coincidence that Chania remains in the first place of cases in Crete and always in the highest positions throughout Greece..."""
"Thank you Steve. Seems like the young uns are getting fed up everywhere! I dont really get the last paragraph. I can understand that Chania has the most cases in Crete, but ' always in the highest position throughout Greece?'I suspect a bit is lost in translation but I get the drift."
"Just announced for Chania:Masks mandatory for all public spaces inside & OUTNo events, no parties, no markets, no gatherings , public or private, of more than 9 people.Max 4 people to a restaurant table, 6 if immediate family members.Of course the closure of bars, clubs etc at midnight continues.haniotika-nea.gr/ektakta-perioristika-metra-…Translation: ""Extraordinary restrictive measures in Chania due to the coronavirus pandemic, the General Secretariat for Civil Protection announced on Monday afternoon.The Communication states:Following an extraordinary meeting at the Centre for Civil Protection Operations and on the basis of the new epidemiological data that have emerged in Chania, at the behest of the Deputy Minister of Civil Protection and Crisis Management, Nikos Chardalias and given the relevant recommendation of the Committee of Experts of the Ministry of Health on the new crown virus, by decision of the Secretary General of Civil Protection Vasilios Papageorgiou, for urgent reasons of addressing a serious public health risk and in particular to limit the spread of the effects of COVID-19 , the following restrictive measures are taken, with application throughout the P.E. of Chania:Suspension of all kinds of events, such as parties, fairs, litanies, popular markets, etc.Ban any kind of gathering of citizens over 9 people for any reason, both in public and private space.A maximum number of people are allowed in the dining areas at each table up to 4 persons, except in the case of first-degree relatives where up to 6 persons are allowed.Mandatory use of masks both outdoors and indoors.It is recalled that the ban on all shops of health interest applies from 12 midnight to 07.00 the following day.It is noted that in consultation with the Ministry of Finance for the companies affected, it is possible to suspend the employment contract of the employeesFinally, the above restrictive measures are valid for 7 days from 06:00 on Tuesday 25-08-2020, until 06:00 on Tuesday 01-09-202"
"@SteveSitia Thanks for bringing this to attentionEdited: 11:02 am, August 24, 2020 "
155 today
"155 new cases today making the rolling 7 day average 14.9 so hopefully its levelling off. I return from Zante on 11/9 and by my calculations if the same trends continue, the number will still be below 20 on that date"
"The rolling average was 14.8 before todays figures,so surely the average cant have went up with a 100+ less cases then yesterday,appreciate todays figure relates to weekend numbers."
"#594 Well, today's is 155 and last Mondays was 147 so it is a slight uptick, but hardly significant I don't think."
Worldometer 155. 7 day rolling average per 100k is 14.9
Good to see the number lower than last few days. Just hoping the shenanigans at Chania dont start causing a large spike for everyone’s sake.
Just for my information: are the new measures also for Paleochora? Do we have to wear masks at the beach as well?
"It seems that the new rules are for the whole Chania prefecture, so yes, Paleochora will be included.Not sure about beach situation."
Surely outside would include beaches too
The situation in Chania sadly shows that all the morons don't actually live within the borders of the UK. :-(
"We were in Chania during the day last week and it wasn't busy, however when we went a couple of evenings later it was heaving. We kept our distance and left soon after we had dinner. We also visited Sougia during the day had lunch and hardly saw anyone. It was very relaxed (but then maybe it gets busy at night as it is quiet and 'chilled').Most places we have been we have felt relaxed apart from Chania and Rethymno in the evenings when everyone is out."
"I think I’ve developed an allergy to the word “scaremongering”. I used to hear this so many times in late Feb and early March when everyone was saying “we only have 200-300 cases, we’ll be ok, it’s just scaremongering”. After you work frontline in the NHS and see patients plus family dying due to covid and go through some drama that some of us went through then maybe you’ll have a different view. It’s not “doom an gloom”. We now know more about this that we knew 6 months ago. People are posting some numbers and statistics in here to help other make an informed decision. Nobody is trying to scare anyone. But the virus is still there. Due to go to Crete next week myself and I am absolutely desperate for a nice holiday. I will go if the numbers remain low as I know that I would probably be safer in there than in UK. What I probably can’t afford to do is to isolate 14 days on return. So that’s why all these “part-time scientists/statisticians” (as someone are calling them in here) are very useful for some of us."

#604 where is your source for the 170 number? I've been using Worldometers throughout which shows 155 today
"Does anyone know more specifically the boundaries for the new regulations for Chania? We are due to be going to stay next week in the mountain village of Asi Gonia, which I believe is in the regional unit of Chania, will we be expected to wear masks when out walking in the mountains....?"
Thanks for the answers! Just good to know. Won't be on the beach much anyway. Only stay 3 days in Paleochora this time and we like to drive around.
If did go to a beach around Paleochora truus it would also be very easy to find one with nobody else on it (not that I am suggesting breaking any guidleines). At the moment the new guidelines run until the 1st of September.
"The original pdf produced by the Greek Govt today said 170, but it was quickly revised down to 155. I don't know why, it does seem to happen nearly every day!"
"Duplicate tests is a common cause but there are others. I’m not aware of them all. Possibly they remove none Greeks that have come through the border and test positive, I know some countries do that."
Thanks Goanjock! Just sent a message to the owner of the apartment we rent and he explained it will only be necessary if it's crowded at the beach. To be in the sea with a mask seems a bit silly. Will keep you updated. We will arrive in Paleochora at August 28th.
"Perhaps it's timely for a gentle reminder that these regulations have been put in place for everyone's benefit to try to stem the increasing numbers of cases. So for me it would clearly be a moral obligation to wear a mask as instructed, as well as a safety decision & to avoid a E150 fine. As visitors to Crete (even after many years for me) I feel it's even more important to honour the people by being extra cautious.The Chania/Rethymno prefecture boundary is approx vertical, from after Kavros down to just East of Frangokastello, yes including Asi Gonia."
You can have 150 tests from samples collected in the last 24h and let’s say another 30 positive results which from samples collected the day before which are reported today. We all know that there is a weekend delay.
Who keeps bring the numbers down ?The official site still says 170.We can believe what we want. I still dont think Greece reports the numbers correctly.https://www.ekathimerini.com/256176/article/…
Thanks for the update truus. Have an amazing time in Paleochora and I look forward to hearing all about it. I would certainly rather be there than in England :-)
"SteveSitia thanks for clarifying re the boundaries. I agree that the regulations should be complied with out of respect for everyone else, I just wanted to check where they applied. We arrive in Asi Gonia on 31 Aug, fingers crossed the regulations won't need to be extended beyond 1 Sept."

Two consecutive days of very low numbers brings the average down to 14.2Fantastic news. There's a good chance we won't see any kind of quarantine enforced on UK travellers to Greece now until the end of the tourist season.Great for the optimists in here.
168 for Greece as a whole today according to Worldometers. 250 on same day last week so takes the average down.
Yes certainly good news :-)

I make that 20 for Crete which seems a bit higher than recent times but I’ve only been watching this for 2 weeks. Overall good to see the 7 day number reduce.
The overall numbers are down but Crete is up. Hope it gets better.
"Crete population is about 650,000 so 20 is a significant number, but only if the figure is replicated over the next few days."
"20 out of 650k is about 3 / 100k. That is not really a significant number, it's still one of the lowest in Europe. Hope it stays that way, we are going end of next week !Edited: 10:14 pm, August 25, 2020 "
"MrSamAce - the rate is a 7 day average, not just one day. If Crete had 20 every day for 7 days the average would be 140/6.5 which is 21.5."

Interesting to see what happens with Czech Republic today as they’ve gone over 20. I can see them removed from the travel corridor list together with Jamaica.
"Yeah possibly, Greece could do with better figures today as well after yesterday. Due to go in just over a week so getting a bit nervous."
Switzerland too. Five more sleeps for me and I don’t think Greece will be added today. The only worry might be next week if cases go up.
Switzerland will definitely be going on today. Very unlikely Greece will be at the moment.
Does anyone know what time the announcements are made? Don’t want to pack for my trip until we know for sure it will go ahead! Thanks!
"@Lacey16 They have been late in the day on Thursday. Not sure of the exact time, probably around 5pm like other announcements have been.Edited: 4:39 am, August 27, 2020 "
Almost certainly won't be added today
https:/…coronavirus-in-greece-updateJust saw this this am. Dont know how trustworthy the blog is.
"Hi we are considering booking a package holiday for late September with Easyjet, if the advice were to change before we go with it being an ABTA package holiday would they just flat out cancel it before we went with the option of an alternative or refund.(thats the scenario we would hope for, we would normally do a DIY but I know we risk losing our flight money if advice changed but the flight went ahead, in that case we wouldn't want to go)Cheers LMS"
Greek announcements are 7pm daily their local time so 5pm for Ireland and UK.So if there are further restrictions made today perhaps it will be at that time.
"Hi lil-miss-sunshine,The answer is on EasyJet's website. They will cancel your holiday if it is known before you go that you will have to quarantine. I hope you get your holiday.https:/…covid-19-responseEdited: 5:27 am, August 27, 2020 "

"This is all on a knife edge at the moment, the waiting game continues."
"Dimitris: does that mean that all of the 360,206 were tested , or just checked to ensure they had the correct forms?"

"Jackie B, these 360,206 were actually tested."
"OK, thanks!"
Can somebody pls post Crete COVID case numbers for today? Can’t seem to find them on the neakriti site.
"They usually get posted 7pm local time. So 5pm UK time.So 1 hour from now.Edited: 11:07 am, August 27, 2020 "
cretapost.gr posted that there are now 217 cases in Crete (total number since the beginning of the pandemic)
"But how many in one day? It was 5 in Chania yesterday, correct?"
259 new cases reported for today.
the way that uk infections appear to be rising its possible the restrictions may be made by Greece never mind uk quarantine
Cases down from yesterday. Hopefully cases fall tomorrow as well.
I got 251 cases and 6 new deaths on Worldometer site
"What is perhaps more significant and surprising is the UK new case figure for today on Worldometers. 1522 is a huge increase on recent daily figures and the highest UK total since early June, I believe.Hopefully this is not the start of an upward trend, or the quarantine boot may be on the other foot with regard to travel between the UK and Greece!"
UK is still bellow Greece in terms of new cases but I wouldn’t be surprised if they will soon ask people to have a negative swab before flying to Greece.
"259 & 6 deaths in Greece today.of which new cases confirmed, in Crete:5 in Heraklion2 in Rethymno9 in Chania"
The UK increase is down to a couple of large clusters discovered in a couple of workplaces and some pubs which didn't enforce social distancing. Doesn't make it any better but at least known cause.
"And as expected, Jamaica, Czech Republic and Switzerland are removed from the travel corridors."
"Confirmed Switzerland, Jamaica and Czech Republic are on the quarantine list for UK now. Greece is still a travel corridor and safe to travel."
"What is Greece at now per 100,000 ?"
"Well since Greece hasn’t been removed from FCO list of exemptions, I’m off to start my packing,So relieved that i can travel and dont need to cancel yet another trip."
@JTAL2002 they are 14.9
AHLDN thank you.
"Jamaica’s situation shows how quickly things can change. Ten days ago I was looking at the list of countries on the travel corridor for an alternative holiday destination in case things don’t go into the right direction in Greece. So, on 17/08 the rate in Jamaica was 3.03 per 100.000. Now it’s over 20."
"9 is high for Chania. Travelling in October and hope it starts to come down well before then! Via a FB forum I had a personal message from a nurse last Sunday, who works at the hospital in Chania. She warned that now is not the best time to visit as cases were rising. I was not sure whether to believe her but now know she was right. I'll be checking with her before we travel!"
Do any of you clever so and sos good at maths know what the numbers would have to be between now and next Thursday to hit the 20 pls ?
@ephraimbacup: Greece must have around 310 new cases every day for the next 6 days to be removed from the travel corridor next week. Given the trends I personally don’t think that this will happen but you never know.
Thanks yes I suppose it seems unlikely . Then it goes up if tomorrows is less than 310
Hi SteveIs there anywhere I can see the daily total for Corfu please - we are due to go in about 4 weeks and i would like to keep an eye on it before our final decision.Thank youLin
9 is very high for a city of 65000....
@Bolero It is for the prefecture not just the city. However it is high enough that Greece are focusing efforts on reducing that number in the region. Give it a week (probably less) and the number will fall.
"9 out of 65,000... in what scenario is 0.01% is a high number? For perspective, the odds of being hit by lightning are 0.03%."
"""9 is very high for a city of 65000....""Chania prefecture has around 160.000 inhabitants"
"Hi Jackie BFrom 1 July till 23 August arived in Greece 2,931,614 visitors and they did 360,206 tests and they found 723 positive.The biggest part of them was asymptomatic.Edited: 4:02 pm, August 27, 2020 "
"The numbers show that Crete is now at the worst point since covid 19 began.Sadly,the average will probably get worse before it gets better but we will get through this."
270 new cases announced today.
I think we will start seeing some 300 numbers next week. Probably not enough to force the government to put Greece on quarantine list on the 5th.
"Greece should have 318 new cases everyday for the next 5 days to trigger quarantine on the 5th of September. Unlikely given the current trends.Edited: 11:21 am, August 28, 2020 "
What does that make the rate per 100000 for today then please?
#690 I make it 15.6 based on 10.7m population
Last sat and sun were quite high so if the next 2 says are similar to lad week mon to thurs would have to be astronomical wouldn’t they
I truly hope so.
"Thanks Nigel B. Do you or anyone else know officially which Greece population figure the UK gov use as you were using 10,700,000 and Worldometers uses 10,416,704. Also there seems to another figure on another site that people use to quote the rate per 100,000. For me in the UK it’s the figure they use that’s important to make the decision of Quarantine so could anyone answer this please? Many thanks"
#695 I'm not sure what number the UK govt uses for population but 10.7m and 10.4m seem to be the two most quoted. I don't subscribe to the notion of adding in the tourist population though. If you use 10.4m the number moves to 16.1
Yes it’s a strange one Nigel. Google seems to have the 2 figures of 10.4 and 10.7 depending on where you look. I much prefer the 15 one to the 16 but would be handy to know officially which one the UK uses as it does seem to make a difference especially if it got to 19... hopefully not tho as I’m a optimist

"I read somewhere that 10.4M, as used on the Worldometer, was a more up-to-date figure than the 10.7M, which in turn suggests that the Greek population is falling. I've tried to find a link, but there are many different ones with different populations currently between 10.4 and 10.7. The only thing they agree on is that yes, the population is falling!"
"To be honest, a 300k difference in population affects the numbers by less than 0.5 so I don’t think it matters much."
What would it take to hit 19 by next review ?
"One or two of you may be interested in this: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…Apologies for those who have seen the link several times on the Greece forum, but there re many who only follow the local news"
"In answer to your question, ephraimbacup, it would have to be an average of 290 per day. so if you include the 7 days from Thursday to Weds.so far we have: 293, 251, 269 BUT also the figures tend to be quite variable during the week. This week the early figures were low. . As long as there are no consistent day-on-day figures of 290+ it should be OK"
177 cases today. Much better..
"14.9 per 100,00 at population of 10,700,000"
So what would each day have to Not make the cut on Thursday ?
"That’s much better is right. Hope this continues. Might have a drink tonight now lol, the waiting on these numbers is unbearable."
"It's really easy to work this out. Add up the last seven days and divide by 107. Very simple. You know the cut off is 20 so you can see what the next 7 days would have to be hit 20.Edited: 12:01 pm, yesterday "
"Approx 340 a day for the next 5 days would bring it to the 20Edited: 12:03 pm, yesterday "
#705 Agree your number. Assume 177 is the official number? I'm predicting the rolling 7 day av per 100k will be 17 by the time I leave Zante on 11/9

What do you have it at for Thursday ?
"For Thursday? I'd say it could be anywhere between 10 and 25... Look at the numbers - the daily swings are between 140 and 290. Nobody can make such predictions with any accuracy and, as said below, if they could they'd have a crystal ball for the lottery numbers. But anyone looking at the daily figures could make a reasonable observation that the trend is that they are plateauing off."

What do we divide by for the uk rate ? 770?
#720. If the UK population is 66.65m you would divide by 666.5 I believe
