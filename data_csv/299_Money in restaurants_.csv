"Hi, I’m travelling to Puerto Del Carmen in August, and was wondering if most restaurants are accepting cash? I don't want to use my debit card as there’s a charge."
Yes it’s been answered a few times but you want to get a card anyway probably a Starling bank if you apply now it will arrive before August. It’s the best way to pay in foreign currency or us a machine you will always get the bulk bank rate every time and cash isn’t insured when you carry it on your hols.
"Where did this money issue ever come from?Of course you can pay in cash, cash will always be king."
"I’d hazard a guess at the current global pandemic!I was in a golf club last week and they wouldn’t take cash, only card!"
"Because of covid-19, many places aren’t taking cash. That’s why I was asking."
Thank you!
There is absolutely no scientific evidence to show covid is transmitted by money despite any scaremongering being put about. Why is money any different to touching any other surface or material?
"You just answered your own argument money is like any other surface and covid last on it for up to 72hrs. So many bushiness across the world are doing card only which they don't touch.Edited: 4:22 pm, July 20, 2020 "
