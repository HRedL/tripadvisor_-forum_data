"Hi,I am planning for a north island holiday between 20th to 28th December with wife and 2 kids ( 13 and 9 year old's) from Fiji. Though I had been to Auckland multiple times, it is the first time for family to visit NZ . I want them to enjoy white Christmas and at any cost dont want to miss taking them to snow (but do not prefer south island this time).My travel will be by car and not campervan.Below is my itinerary. Suggestions and ideas please.AucklandDay 1 / 20th DecFlight reaches by noon.Relax.Overnight in AucklandDay 2 / 21st DecMOTATAuckland zooNewzealand maritime museumSky Tower in the eveningOvernight in AucklandDay 3 / 22nd DecAuckland botanical gardensButterfly creekOvernight in AucklandDay 4 / 23rd DecDrive to Rotorua3d trick art galleryVelocity valleyTepuiaWai-o-tapu thermal wonderlandOvernight in RotoruaDay 5 / 24th DecLeave for whakapapaOn the way Huka falls tracks @ TaupoOvernight in WhakapapaDay 6 / 25th DecWhakapapa village and snow.Overnight in whakapapaDay 7 / 26th DecDrive back to Auckland and on the way Hobitton.Overnight in AucklandDay 8 / 27th DecBack to Nadi by noon."
December is summer in New Zealand! I think the only snow you could possibly see is on South Island on the upper regions of Mount Cook from the distance.
"Kia ora,as above, there will be no snow at that time of year. I would suggest that you spend more time in Rotorua as there are heaps of things to do there, instead of Whakapapa. Book accommodation now!Cheery!Edited: 1 year ago "
"Yep, No snow on the ski fields in summer. There might be a tiny bit up on the summit of Ruapehu, but that is quite a hike!Do be aware that this is the single busiest week of the year for summer holidays in Aust as well as NZ so you need to get accommodation booked YESTERDAY!"
Bala welcome to the NZ forum.Are you sure you have picked the right country for a white Christmas NZ is in the Southern Hemisphere and snow is usually found in the Northern hemisphere at the time of year you are travellingAll I can suggest you do is fly into Christchurch or Queenstown and head to either Mt Cook or Fox or Franz Josef Glaciers and do a Helihike or Scenic flight with a snow landing on one of those.Edited: 1 year ago 
"The Tongariro NP mountain caps may have some ice left, once the snow has melted. But looking at your itinerary, you do need to spend more time in Rotorua with a family in mind. Geysers and mud pools are awesome, and your children wont miss seeing a white Christmas at all! Plenty to do and see in Rotorua. Ensure that you have accommodation bookings in place asap. And pre-book your Hobbiton tour slot now."
"We stayed at Whakapapa a few years ago around Christmastime and took the chairlift up Ruapehu so the kids could see and play in snow. There were sleds for rent and there was winter wear for rent too. Our kids loved it.However, the scenic chairlift ride website currently says, ""Due to the construction of Whakapapa's new gondola this summer, sightseeing will be unavailable (from October 22nd). Sightseeing will be back bigger and better than ever for our winter season 2019!"" Maybe call or email them to confirm the details.https:/…summer-sightseeing"
"Re post #6 - yes the new Sky Waka did open on time. But that still doesn't guarantee there will be any snow at the top.Revisiting the rest of the itinerary, I think day 3 in Auckland could be dropped and perhaps Hobbiton could be visited this day enroute to Rotorua (2N)Day 4 can be the usual Rotorua attractionsDay 5. Visit Wai-o-Tapu, then Taupo, then Whakapapa (2N)Day 6. Sky Waka; short hikes etcDay 7. Drive back to Auckland"
Thanks all. I am reworking this based on your feedback.
"Hi All,I have reduced one day in Auckland and added it to Rotorua.Mt.Ruapehu team replied that they will have the chairlift operational and it is unlikely to see snow during my time of visit.Apart from the snow part is it worth spending a day and a half in whakapapa?I will be booking my accommodation and Hobitton show also before EOD based on your suggestions.We have a special birthday in our family on 24th Dec and want to make it memorable too.Day 1 / 20th DecFlight reaches by noon.Relax.Overnight in AucklandDay 2 / 21st DecMOTATAuckland zooNew zealand maritime museumAuckland botanical gardensSky Tower in the eveningButterfly creekOvernight in Auckland(drop one or two places if necessary)Day 3 / 22nd DecDrive to Rotorua3d trick art galleryVelocity valleyOvernight in RotoruaDay 4 / 23rd DecGeysers and mud poolTepuiaWai-o-tapu thermal wonderlandOvernight in RotoruaDay 5 / 24th DecLeave for whakapapaOn the way Huka falls tracks @ TaupoOvernight in Whakapapa Chateau Tongariro HotelDay 6 / 25th DecWhakapapa village.Mt.Ruapehu Chairlift.Overnight in whakapapaDay 7 / 26th DecDrive back to Auckland and on the way Hobitton.Overnight in AucklandDay 8 / 27th DecBack to Nadi by noon."
"Rather than returning to Auckland through Taupo with a side visit to Hobbiton, I recommend that you visit Hobbiton on the way to Rotorua.From Tongariro NP, return to Auckland using SH4 & SH3 via Te Kuiti. You may have time to visit the main Waitomo glow-worm cave that day to break the long drive back to Auckland."

"You've sorted Hobbiton but you still have Wai-o-Tapu in the wrong place. It is between Rotorua & taupo so you will best fit it in at 10 am on day 5. The forced ""eruption"" of Lady Knox Geyser occurs at 10:15. After walking around the Park, you will be in Taupo in time for lunch.WRT Auckland, I suggest you either drop Butterfly Creek or visit it on your lats morning before retuning the car & flying out, as it is near the airport. Sadly, I think you'll also have to drop the Auckland Botanic Gardens as they are a long way out of the CBD."
Thanks for highlighting zhuhai2007. Rotorua seems like a happening place. I am thinking of cutting a day in whakapapa. How about spending Day 5 also in Rotorua. Day 6 I can do wai-o-tapu on the way to whakapapa?Day 1 - AucklandDay 2 - AucklandDay 3 - Rotorua ( hobitton on the way)Day 4 - RotoruaDay 5 - RotoruaDay 6 - Whakapapa (Wai-o-tapu on the way)Day 7 - Mt. Ruapehu Chairlift in the morning. Return to Auckland (Waitomo glow worm on the way)Day 8 - Return flight ( Butterfly creek near airport)
"Yes, you could certainly do Wai O Tapu on the way to Whakapapa. It is a very colourful thermal field, but is only 30km out of Rotorua so it will not break up the drive. Stop in to see Huka Falls near Taupo, maybe a quick look at the Honey Hive (best selection of honey from native flowers I've seen but oh how they charge!), and there is a great selection of cafés in town. At Whakapapa, there are multiple short walks - snow won't be happening, but bushwalks galore await, although the weather - as always in New Zealand - is unpredictable, and at 1200m (height of Whakapapa village below the skifield), the weather is more unpredictable again!Short walks: https:/…Depending on how fit and active your children are, the Whakapapanui or Taranaki Falls tracks might appeal, see the staff at the Visitor Centre for more details. Note the Whakapapaiti Track, in contrast, is quite difficult, so read the signs with care :)You have a very active sightseeing list planned - hopefully you are not totally exhausted by the time you return to Fiji!"
"You have time for a short visit to Hamilton Gardens, before you reach Rotorua on Day 3. The themed gardens including the India garden will be spectacular by late December! Have morning tea at the gardens so that you are all prepared for your tour by the time you get to Shire's Rest, which is the carpark and ticket office for the Hobbiton tour.Tongariro NP back to Auckland, and with a stop at the Waitomo Caves is a long day. Far better to drive as far as Otorohanga or Hamilton, and go to the airport directly on your final day in NZ. Hamilton is about 2 hours drive from Auckland airport, while Otorohanga is 3 hours away, for a noon checkin."
"Thanks cdn-npl. Kids are fit enough to trek. But we have done it so many times in Fiji and doubt that they will be interested to do this in NZ. Hamilton gardens seems to be interesting.As far as the itinerary is considered I haven't drilled it down to the level of time and travel distance. I can make changes as soon as the overall itinerary is finalized.I have done my research in whakapapa and the only hotel I am interested in is offering a cabin room outside the hotel with no refund or no change of dates. My itinerary and stay is more or less finalized until 24th December morning. I am losing my mind to go to whakapapa. If I skip Whakapapa what other options do I have to spend time on 24th,25th and 26th?. How about flying to Christchurch and spend two days there?"
"If your kids don't like hiking (I'm sure you weren't intending to do any ""trekking""!) then you could skip Whakapap as that is all there is to do there. Don't forget you are coming at the absolute busiest time of the year so no wonder the hotel is saying no cancellations or changes. They might not do 1N stays at Xmas, as they have to pay their staff a lot extra (double time may be?) and most will want the day off."
"Do you know what, my children at that age would have been more than happy to play at the beach, and frolic in the surf at a coastal hot-spot! If you miss Whakapapa - Tongariro NP, then head for a beach like Mt Maunganui or Waihi Beach and allow your children to have some fun time before heading back to Auckland.Raglan is a brilliant location if you can find accommodation after visiting the Waitomo caves. Raglan is 40 minutes west of Hamilton city."
Thanks all. I clearly understood the importance of valid discussions with people who know. I have booked all of my rooms and Hobitton show also. Some of the suggestions were mind blowing and few I had to let it go. But overall my itinerary is in better shape now. Thanks for Your time.
"Hi,I finally found snow in Mt.Ruapehu. Snow in north island is possible. Kids loved it. We spent about 2 hours playing in snow on 25th December. A white Christmas finally :-)Thanks AllBala"
Have you finalised your itinerary yet so we might be able to offer further suggestions?.
"GTS, they traveled over the Christmas holidays!"
