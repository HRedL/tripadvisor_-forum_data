According to a figure quoted today in the press there are 13-15 cases inTenerife. This is quite a jump from yesterday when there were 6 cases only. Where are the new cases? We are due our 4 weeks today so obviously curious as there didn’t appear to have been any spread from the original outbreak
"There was not 6 yesterday was there?it was already up to 12 yesterday or before.the spread is expected to be fair.If I remember correct 6-7 came from the original hotel, the rest could have been contact from them, or new from many of the tourists or locals.Not sure if you are saying you arrive today for 4 weeks, or your due to fly in 4 weeks.But it is getting to the point were the sooner the better, as a lot of uncertainty in the weeks and months ahead."
The numbers have been steadily increasing not jumping. 4 of these are the original Italians. These and others in this number have been discharged.

"From janetanscombe blogUpdated 5.15pm, 11/3: Following the Canarian Government’s extraordinary session chaired by President Torres, all social, sporting and cultural events involving more than 1,000 people are suspended. Visits to patients in hospitals are restricted, as are visits to nursing homes. All clubs and social centres for the elderly are suspended for a fortnight. With specific regard to carnivals, the president said that they are activities with a massive influx of people and they are therefore suspended. The Government intends to contain the virus, Torres said, and for that reason it has to take preventative measures, confirmed health minister Teresa Cruz"
"Not sure about the accuracy, but this local news site seems to show the number fo cases in Tenerife as 20 - including the 6 cases in Costa Adeje and another five in La Laguna. https:/…"
As of today there have been 3000 people infected in Spain with the coronavirus and there have been 84 deaths.I would postpone my trip until the crisis ends in several months.
Other countries seem to have had a sharp increase as the virus takes hold. The UK is due for such a spike very soon so no difference to anywhere else
"28 confirmed cases od COVID-19 according to Spanish Ministry of Health (up to date for 12th MAR evening), but only one person was taken to hospital."
