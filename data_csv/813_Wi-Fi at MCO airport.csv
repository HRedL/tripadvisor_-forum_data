"Hi guys ,when i land at Orlando and contact uber for a pick-up will there be free WiFi available so i can use my app ThanksGary ."
"This is the first link on Google when I put in ""MCO wifi""https://www.orlandoairports.net/wifi.htmScroll down a bit to see it all"
Hi GaryWe’ve never had any issues getting WiFi at MCO..
It’s a bit slow but it’s free
"Thanks guys , much appreciated .Its really just to get in touch with Uber and get picked up , dont want any hassle after a 10 hour flight ."
You could hire a car service. Sounds expensive but it’ll cost maybe $20 more (roundtrip) and your driver will track your flight in case of delays and meet you at baggage claim. Google Tony Hinds for contact info or price out some of the others.
Hi GaryAre you aware that the ESTAs are currently suspended and you are advised not to travel to the USA.https:/…entry-requirements
We havent booked anything yet and we are not looking to go until next April so a lot depends on the covid-19 situation.
"Others may feel differently, but I wouldn't use wifi with any sort of personal information. I mean, it is fine for directions or looking for restaurants, but there is too much crap going on right now to give out anything close to personal information. I would also agree with a town car or limo service. Town cars are awesome after a long flight."
"All im doing is logging into the Uber app and booking a cab ride, i wont be giving any of my private info out ."
"It always surprises me how technologically behind Europe is when I’m in Florida. Hardly anywhere uses chip and pin and not once have I used contactless in the years I have been visiting. I’m not surprised that some Floridans are a bit scared of using these new fanckled things like Apps.Edited: 2:07 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"That surprises me to , i would of thought that Orlando would be right up there when it comes to technology. Personally i havent used cash for a few years , i would be a muggers nightmare as i dont carry cash lolol .Pretty much every thing is controlled by apps in the uk , i turn my lights on , heating on and bank by Apps ."
"Of topic but I hardly use cash when I'm in Orlando, and have used contactless payments, and chip & pin there as well."
"Thats suites me to , just hate to carry cash ."
The WiFi in MCO has always been fine for us - no problems.Nice to have something to plan for Gary. We were due to go at the end of March next year but I’m not sure we will now.

I was also referring to an unsecured wifi network.
"But you said its fine looking for directions or doing a search , thats the same wi-fi network i will use to order a cab with uber .Once your logged on to the wi-fi it doesnt matter what you use it for your still as vulnerable as the next person .My phone will warn me if someone is trying to hack my phone. Most phones in the uk will have some sort of built in security."
Not quite sure why anyone is worried about using the airport WiFi. Yes it’s an open network but isn’t Disney ‘s MDE which everyone uses all day in the parks. Of course you never do banking and such like on an open network but it’s fine for booking cabs and restaurants etc.
Exactly...well said .
