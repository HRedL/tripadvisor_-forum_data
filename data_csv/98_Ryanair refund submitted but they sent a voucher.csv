"Hi there, I read a lot of people here commented previously about getting refund for cancelled flight with Ryanair. I have managed to sent application for refund nearly 3 weeks ago and since then received a couple of emails from Ryanair reassuring me that my application is with them and they need more time. I have received an email today for one of my applications with a voucher! If I don't want to accept it, I can ask for a refund (again), but I will be put in a queue until Covid19 crisis will pass. The link provided simply says contact us...which we all know is an impossible task. So no link for another application for a refund, nothing. I read about airlines trying to get a new regulation through allowing them to issue vouchers instead of refund, but nothing has been approved. I already had an application submitted and reassurance that it will be processed. Is it even legal? I doubt. I think they are trying their luck. Has anyone got any idea where should I go from here? Thank you in advance for any help."
Interesting- I am waiting on a refund too from Ryanair. Wonder if you paid by credit card you could try a charge back since they cancelled your flight and you are struggling to get your money back? It’s something I may try if the try and issue me with a voucher. I’m also waiting for a refund from Loganair. BA were great (even though I had to call up to get it) but they had money back in my credit card within 5 days. Good luck in getting your money back - I will let you know how I get on too
I had the same email. It's taking the p*** to be honest. Requested refund four weeks ago and had two emails in the meantime apologising for the delay but reassuring me it was being dealt with . Now just received a voucher I didn't ask for and being told that if I want a refund I'll need to contact them again. I'll be filing a section 75 claim with my cardprovider next week as they're wasting my time.
"I paid with debit card unfortunately; lesson learnt for me. I will try to call my bank tomorrow anyway to see if they can do something about it. I will also try to contact Ryanair, somehow...I will definitely post here if I managed to figure out something as it seems more people will have the same problem. Thank you and Good Luck to you too with your refund."
"Yep. Ryanair is playing the same bait and switch game with all of us. I too submitted a refund (for cash) about 21 days ago. Just this evening got an email offering me a ""voucher"" and a link to their website at which to contact them if I want cash instead. After following the link there are no instructions on how to request my money back again. There is just an ominous message designed to put me off of requesting a refund that indicates my 2nd request for a refund will be put in a queue and worked sometime after the COVID crisis is over. Complete bv!!5h!t. Never again will I book a Ryanair flight. Contacting my credit card company now."
I'm in the same situation with Ryan - already submitted the form and waiting for refund. Not sure how the chargeback works? Different countries have different rules? The credit card company could/ may come back to say that the Airlines is offering you a voucher so no question of chargeback. Just thinking aloud
Also requested a refund nearly a month ago and today been sent a voucher that I don’t want! Having lost my job due to this I need to feed my child and a bloody holiday voucher isn’t going to do this. I’m going to be getting onto live chat with Ryan air first thing tomorrow I’m really not happy!
"Yup, in the same boat. Have three sets of flights and eventually managed to ask for refund. Initial email stated 7 working days and then when I contacted them they said 28 working days and tonight have received a message with an offer of a voucher. Absolutely raging. Not sure where I go now but going to fight this."
"Got the same email, waited for weeks to get my money back, and then this f..... voucher arrived. They are simply trying to scam people into not claiming their money, as there are no instructions on the link how to get our money back.First of all I will send my claim in an email to Ryanair, my best guess on an email address is this one: ryanairen@ryanair.com. This I will do just to make sure I have some legal proof that I made my claim, in case there's a common public lawsuit down the road against Ryanair.Next thing I will do is contact my bank and do a credit card fraud claim against Ryanair, in my book this is fraud.The last thing I will do is NEVER EVER with Ryanair again!Edited: 1:41 am, April 18, 2020 "
Please report the scam to the authorities here:https:/…
"Same here. Flight cancelled on 19th March so requested a refund long ago. I have been receiving multiple emails saying they were processing the refund and asking me to please wait. Now got told I have been issued a voucher instead but I can follow a link to contact them and get the cash. The link takes you to a page where you need to find the ""contact"" section and fight with a Bot to get to talk to an agent. I am sure I will be in a queue for hours."
"Had exactly the same prblem, was told weeks ago money would be refunded back to my card, and had reminders since. Now I have got a voucher I did not ask for. I'm trying to call Ryanair but can't get through. Will probably make a section 75 claim instead."
Ryanair is an Irish company so probably not much use to repprt the to the UK government. I had a closer look at the voucher and you just have to use it to book within 12 months which is a lot better than having to travel within 12 months.
"Btw, I also cancelled a JAL flight a week ago (for May 2020) and got the money 2 days later!"
"If you book direct, Yona, you get refunds, and quickly. Use an agency and you lose most of your protections."
This has nothing to do with booking direct vs booking from an agent.
"No, Lex, but Yona referred to a refund from JAL. I was replying to that"
But that didn't have anything to do with booking direct either (?) I'm guessing the people who are now receiving vouchers from Ryanair following refund requests have all booked direct from Ryanair so it's not even correct to say that booking direct means quick refunds. It depends on how the airline is handling the situation.
Exactly same experience for me . First of my cancelled flights have been sent voucher for .. have 1 more cancelled flight I have requested refund for and 1 more flight that in late May I am assuming will also be cancelled soon. Thanks for the link above to gov.uk .. i have reported Ryan Are on this as well. Off to see if I can see another advice on the Net related to this .
"Got the same problem, have two flights booked with them, Received various emails saying refund would be processed, just would take awhile. I want to receive a refund rather then a voucher, don't mind waiting, as long as I know the refunds are being processed. How do you get in touch with them to request a refund now. Does anybody know? unfortunately paid using a Debit card."
Awhile back I received an email stating I could ask for a voucher or keep waiting for my refund. When was the flight you received a voucher for?
"Just fyi, if you go into the Contact Chat at the bottom of the link sent on the email and ask for an Agent you get to talk to a human. I had to wait ""only"" 30-40min. As discussed here they tell you the refund for cash will be done ""when the pandemic is over"" but after insisting they said ""in 28 business days"". Do not know if that is true but asked for a transcript (that I have not received yet so make screenshots). It should not be this hard and honestly, Ryanair could have simply given a 110% voucher or similar and then I may have thought on keeping that instead!"
My refund was requested 19th march 2020. The flight was 23rd March 2020. I suppose they are sending these vouchers around a month after the initial request was done.
My flight was 1st April I got a voucher for. I have today claimed via the credit card.
Glad you got it sorted . Currently online in queue for online chat. Been 1 hr 55 mins so far and still waiting !
let me know how you get on
"Same thing here. On 21.3.2020 I recived an email about cancellation and that I have a right for full refund, so I filled and sent the form. I made a screenshot of it too. And yesterday I recieved a voucher saying if I want a full refund, I should contact them. WTF, I already filled a form 3 weeks ago! Live chat impossible, calling them impossible (and expensive). But there is no way on earth I am not getting my money back, especially after this."
Have you contacted your card company which you used to purchase your ticket to see if they can help? American Express helped me this morning when I have exactly the same problem.
Same boat. What shoud i do?
"So, am I right in thinking that I can redeem the voucher anytime between now and April 2021 for a flight which takes place. at some stage beyond April 2021, for example July 2021"
"Ryanair have duped us all. They were quick to offer a refund about 3 weeks ago, we were pleased that for once Ryanair were on the ball and honourable- how wrong we were! I paid on credit card so will be pursuing my money that way. I’m not bothering with Ryanair as they we will only get duped again. Good luck to those who paid by debit card, and to everyone stay safe."
"Same problem with my refunds request. I have used the link you provided to make a complaint. ThanksEdited: 6:11 am, April 18, 2020 "
I received that same email yesterday. I clicked on link to say I wanted to claim refund. Eventually I entered into a chat with robot. I clicked on I need to speak to an agent. After a 15 minute wait an agent answered and I was told they’d put me in a queue and give me a refund after the emergency is over. In the meantime if i wish to use the voucher I can do that and will not be refunded. I am lucky that I don’t need the refund immediately. I’m told by others that all flight companies are using the same tactics in a bid to stay in business. It’s not just Ryanair.
Hi. I'm on the same problem. They don't want to give the money back and I suspect that they're willing to be sued for breaking law. It's a strategy to gain time. They have thousands of millions of pounds in cash for free (from holidaymakers) without any obligation. What bank is going to offer a loan under those conditions? I made a compliant before Ryanair as first step to go for CAA. No more can be done for now. Be patient because it's a long way. Regards.
Same with us. I have contacted my credit card company to raise a section 75 against Ryan Air. They said it will be tricky as Ryan Air have said they will give us a refund after COVID19. I pointed out I have email confirmation that my refund was being processed so they are going to move forwards against Ryan Air in a dispute. I have also put in a formal complaint against the company and filled in the COVID 19 government form about unlawful/unfair behaviour by a company. Will watch this space now.
"In the same boat, been waiting 30 minutes so far in the chatbot queue....has anyone actually got through via chatbot?"
"Same story as everyone else. Managed to speak to an agent on web chat this morning. I quoted the EU directive on refunds due to cancellations. I had to push for the refund as the agent kept pushing the voucher. I was told I would go into a refund queue and there is no timeline for a refund. He refused to provide a reference for the interaction. I asked for an email transcript and he confirmed that he would send it. I have not received it. Luckily I screen grabbed the entire conversation. I have also made a complaint thorough the CMA. Good luck everyone, I 'm doubting I'll ever get a refund but will enjoy the fight for it."
"Hi. I am in the same position as you guys. I have 3 flights for which I need refunds. I paid with credit card but value of each is under £100, so the cc company won't refund. I am holding out for cash. I have a long memory and when this is over Ryanair will be added to my list of companies who have behaved terribly to customers and staff during this crisis. I have a white list of companies who have behaved well and will be giving them my business in future."
How long did you have to queue to speak to someone?
Took me about an hour until an agent responded.
"For me, I'm waiting for more than 3 hours, but nothing. Will keep waiting. It's a nightmare..."
"Yep...same happened to me but very strange my friend booked on same flights travelling with me, we both filled in refund form same day, yesterday hes been refunded in full back into his bank, i got the crappy voucher with the notes they will have to wait til after covid19.... if you want full refund. No way im accepting this voucher, if i have to i will try chargeback on credit card."
I booked direct and ive been fobbed off with voucher not refund ive asked for.
"Same here, voucher no good to me, refund is my choice, however Mr O’Leary is making it impossible for me and others to contact his company, a 100% crook.Will contact my c/card company to enlist their assistance."
I am in exactly the same position. Ryanair promised a refund within 20 days but have now sent me a voucher. They are a disgrace
I same situation had two flights cancelled and completed a claim form for both. Had two emails saying they being death with and today one offering a voucher. Impossible to contact. Luckily booked on credit card so think? Can get it back that way? Will enquire
"Exactly the same problem here, too. Reported Ryanair to the Markets & Affairs commission. Has anyone got their CC company to refund them?"
I have filed a dispute today with American Express. Won't know the outcome until they've had a chance to investigate it The fact that Ryanair have emailed an (unrequested) voucher may complicate matters but I'm hoping AmEx will come through for me.
"I am not a bitter person but tend to agree, some companies clearly not appreciate this is a stressful time for all both emotionally and financially. Ryanair off my Christmas card list"
Agree some companies clearly don't care that this is an emotional and financially difficult time for people and wish to add to the stress.
"I cancelled my flight at similar time on 20th March. I managed to speak to Ryanair who told me my refund would be processed ""hopefully"" within 28 days, still no refund and they are impossible to get hold of. My Mum had a flight booked with Jet2 at a similar time and they refunded within 7 days. I am unsure where to turn and now believe I won't be receiving a refund."
You have to click on the link in the email. Then enter into a chat with a robot. Next click on I need to speak with an agent. They will add your name to th list for a refund which will be dealt with after the emergency is over. In the meantime if you want you can use the voucher and you won’t be refunded. Best to do this early in the morning. I had to wait for an agent for 15mins at 11am but others waited much longer later on.
"Been waiting 2 hour now to speak to someone, joined queue at 11am"
Echo everything everyone has said. Waited over 3 hours for an available agent on web chat ( we have a couple of iPads) Decided to put my complaint in via email contact form using OTHER as the category to try to prevent going on the Refund Request pile of non answered emails. Took a screen shot of my complaint before I sent it as evidence of what I wrote. It worked... I now have an email from Ryanair to say my query has been registered and I have a reference number... more evidence.I did make the point that if they are very busy why are they forcing people to contact them multiple times regarding the same thing. Their delay tactics are adding to their workload.
I have been in the chatbots queue for over 3 hours and still waiting!
"4 hours and 20 minutes, I won! But it's not a joke, it's a real real shame... Can wait for 30 minutes more, but I have other things to do."
Can I ask is the voucher for a fixed sum? Or can you re-book any route?
"hi, for me the same, very very bad company.They make it so difficult for everyone.I cancelled my renting car and my hotel also and got the money in 2 days on my bank account"
The voucher is for the amount you are owed. You can use it to book any route and if the new flight is cheaper you will be able to use the outstanding amount for a different booking.
"Got the same email and link to nowhere Has anyone ever managed to get a cash refund from Ryanair???No, of course not"
"Just called 033010078386. Got through in 6 mins, confirmed I have voucher email after receiving 2 emails like everyone to say I was getting refund!!! Spoke to Liza in Poland Ryanair and she confirm my refusal to voucher and that I wanted cash credit card refund!!! Hopefully sorted watch this space!!!!!!I have another flight where I have applied for refund but as I had not had the email yet offering voucher instead of money she could not request cash refund , so unfortunately I have to call back when that email comes !!!! Hope this helpsEdited: 9:32 am, April 18, 2020 "
Ring I was in chat room for 2hrs just got through 6 mins press 5 for other query
"I got the same yesterday even though I asked for a full refund.I have had their live chat on in the background and waiting for 'the next available assistant' to help for 5 hours and counting!!! down the email voucher they have a link which you can refuse the voucher - but when you do it only tells you more about how to use the voucher. Ryanair are usually one of the best to issue refunds, in my experience, but because of corona virus all companies are trying to get to to keep the voucher, either by tricking you or wearing you down so that you give up."
"Same situation here. If i want a refund, I will go in a queue and wait ""until the COVID-19 emergency has passed"". There is no definition of what this means and as things stand the COVID-19 emergency could go on for a very long time."
"I have had the same email. I had submitted a claim for the refund but what has really sent me over the edge is the fact that they only sent a voucher to cover the flight and not the money I paid for my baggage and carbon footprint. So my voucher is short 42.00. If you select the option to reject the voucher it brings you nowhere. Anybody hear of a class action lawsuit count me in.Edited: 10:36 am, April 18, 2020 "
"Called on 033010078386 option 6, got theough in ten mins and cancelled voucher and out in queue for refund."
"This has happened to me last evening and no matter how I try I can't contact them I paid by credit card back in November but I'll still try and contact them or is it too late. As soon as they contacted me 25th March I applied for a refund and like everyone else I've had 2 emails advising me that my request for a refund is in a queue now I'm offered a voucher which I don't want. I'm so glad it's not just me. I'd booked separately but was going with my son and his family, they started the process hours before me but as yet they've not had this recent email."
"I waited on chat for 3 hours and never got connected. Rang up and connected in under 25 mins (033010078386) option 6 I think. They cancelled voucher and said I would be put in refund queue. I also rang credit card company and they have agreed to proceed with section 75 if Ryanair do not refund me in 30 days. I informed Ryanair and said I was recording the call for personal use as is my legal right. They hung up on me. At least I got all my vouchers cancelled beforehand! I have also emailed quoting this legislation;""Regulation EC261/2004 provides important rights to passengers applicable at all times, including during the current unprecedented situation. Where flights are cancelled or there are long delays, airlines are required to assist passengers by providing information on their rights and providing care and assistance during the disruption such as providing meals, allowing for passengers to communicate messages, and providing hotel accommodation (and transfers to and from the hotel) for overnight delays. Where flights are cancelled passengers must be offered the choice of:a refund; orre-routing (alternative flights) at the earliest opportunity; orre-routing at a later date (subject to availability)."""
"Firstly can I say thank you to everyone on here for all your advice! I only stumbled across this strand whilst trying to search ways of contacting Ryanair!! I am in the same boat-offered a refund some time ago, confirmed it was on its way but will take time and then yesterday received a voucher I do not want! Tried lots of ways to contactethem -soul-destroying BUT thank you Rayner S- I tried your number and got through within minutes!! Just to reiterate 033010078386 and then I pressed 6 for other query and got through to a lady called Eya. The poor thing sounded like she was losing the will to live as I have no doubt she has been inundated with these calls today. She dealt with me swiftly and said that she would put me onto the list for refund and cancel my voucher and I would get an email to confirm this and one advising of the refund whenever that may be. So I know I will still have a wait BUT I have been 'logged' as someone who does not want their voucher! I also wrote a complaint to back this up via the online email contact form-followed the advice of another on here and simply chose Other from the drop down, told them I had spoken to someone and that I want written confirmation of what is going on with my refund and that my email be logged as an official complaint! I got an automated email reponse saying my email is logged-let's see if I get a response if not I will try the credit card route...."
""" I paid by credit card back in November but I'll still try and contact them or is it too late.""It's not too late to file a claim with your creditcard company."
Is this a premium cost phone number do you know?
Hi - does anyone know how the chargeback claim works on the credit card in this case?Has anybody had success in getting the refund from the card company??
Ring who I cant find a telephone number
"""Hi - does anyone know how the chargeback claim works on the credit card in this case?""You need to talk to your cardprovider. Some (e.g. American Express) let you file a dispute online."
"So I am in the same situation...waited 4 weeks for a ""refund"" to then be sent a voucher which i have not asked for and never been informed that would be the case. I have just spoke to someone at Ryanair asking for a refund and apparently the department that are dealing with refunds are not able to work due to Coronavirus and unsure when they will be back to work. Funny that I spoke to a customer service agent and they are able to work but the refund department can't.... Its just a why to gain interest on our money and utter nonsense about unable to work. I work for a large company and have been able to get call centre and back office staff working from home to service our customers which was a totally new concept for us.."
"Same message here, spent 2 1/2hrs sending a message every minute to a chat bot but no response gave up which is what they want you to do"
I’m in the exact same situation. It just says “contact us”. I’ve tried the live chat many times and still no further ahead. How have you got on?
"Sorry for the maybe silly question, but what is the difference between paying with a credit card or a debit card when it comes to chargebacks? I would really appreciate an answer, because I also have a couple of claims and am waiting for refunds."
"I have had exactly the same experience with Ryanair. My application for a refund was confirmed on 20th March & this was followed in the last few weeks by 2 emails asking me to be patient while waiting for my refund to be processed. Last night I received an email containing a voucher instead of a cash refund. As already stated , it is impossible to contact Ryanair online or by phone to refuse the voucher deal. Today I contacted my credit card provider to start proceedings against Ryanair. What they are doing is illegal."
Same for us too.I have reported to the competition and markets Authority team through the .gov websiteI am looking at a small claims court processI’ll also be talking to m6 credit card companyLike many others we will NEVER book Ryanair again
I have also reported Ryanair through the .gov website
"Same here. Asked refund, got voucher. Tried to contact using live chat,no one respond...kept my laptop on all day with chat open. It showed that I am in queue!! But all day nothing! Tried to call..was on hold for 14min, then checked my phone bill,was £9 already. It's impossible to contact them! Very disappointed!"
"Hi, in the UK there is a law where if you pay using a credit card you have extra protection when you spend over £100.00. You can legally claim from the credit card provider if you can't resolve it with the seller."
"Me too, just received a voucher. Applied for a refund for holiday commencing 27/3/20. The link won’t allow you to request the refund. Checked on my bookings and all my flights have been deleted like they don’t exist. I’d booked quite a few flights for this year, so don’t want vouchers for all of them. It’s disgraceful. How do we contact customer service?"
"Oh I see, thank you. I have disputed the debit card charge nevertheless and hope it works out."
Thankyou for this information I have submitted
Did you get anywhere with credit card company offering to cover refund???
I got in touch with them yesterday by chat. I'm in the same position wanted a refund but was given a voucher. I was told all the staff that deal with refunds are at home in self isolation. Was told can have a refund but have to wait until the covid 19 episode has passed. Basically they don't have the money until planes fly again or the government bails them out. Not sure where to go from here.?
That isn't true I booked direct and requested a refund but like all others was given a voucher instead
"It’s reassuring to see that so many people are in the same position so I expect that there will be something done about this issue. I have received the voucher for one flight but not for another I have had cancelled. I waited over 3 hours on chat for a real person but gave up. I have today sent a message to their Facebook page. If anyone has any success online rather than on a phone line that costs me to call please keep us all updated. Good luck everyone, we will succeed."
"What about the £5 billion cash that O'Leary said they held at the beginning of the cancellation period? And if they have no staff as they're all in self isolation, how can they offer flights post May 2020 as currently shown as available on their website if they have no staff to process these?"
"rang this number about an hour ago 03301007838 waited for message, chose option 6, actually got through to a lady within a minute!!!Explained I'd already had 2 previous emails confirming my refund was being processed, and latest email now offering voucher.I explained I DID NOT WANT the voucher option, only the refund, she advised she would mark that against my Booking could not send me any confirmation that this had been done, or when I would receive my refund ""due to the pandemic"", but it was noted on there, so fingers crossed!!"

"Hi Ewelina,I am in the same position here. However, I visited the link Ryanair sent me (https:/…refund-voucher), and if you were to scroll right down to the bottom of the page, you can start a live chat and an agent will be able to help get your cash refund claim in their processing queue.The wait times to speak with an agent (As at 12:00, 19/4) took me 30 minutes, which was reasonable as compared with the call centre, and the process to get my cash refund claim in the processing queue was straightforward.I hope this will be of some use to all struggling to reach an agent via their call centre helpline."
"Hi Guys! Thank you for all your great and useful comments. I really appreciate that. I just spoke to the Agent through chatbot. What I got from my conversation today? Not much, they will process my refund with additional standard comment: “Please note that as our payment agents are required to stay at home in the fight against COVID19 pandemic, payment security restrictions prevent us from processing cash refunds until the COVID19 crisis has abated”. Time frame? No realistic time frame after I raised my points that refund policy is clear and should apply regardless of the situation. The answer was simple – “I totally see your point, but this is the only time frame that I can provide you with”. And that is very concerning, because they cannot tell you when you get your refund back or they simply don’t know. That means your money potentially will stuck in limbo. I have another 3 bookings with them. This one was worth around £45 and I asked for a refund, but my next flight was worth £300, so looking at the response I have received today and overall articles I read from newspapers, I have no confidence that I will get this money back any soon. I will either use the voucher or see my money being stuck somewhere. As much as I could ‘sacrifice’ my first flight, I will not do it with £300. The Agent told me if I get a voucher for that one, I will have to contact them again. He also said that the voucher is for any destination HOWEVER the vouchers are name sensitive, meaning you can only book under the previous passengers names. And that may make it difficult for some people. I have another 2 people on my booking. Sorry for a long comment, but reading all the news and having this response from Ryanair, there is not much I can do. I paid with debit card, so I will contact my bank tomorrow and see. I will also speak to Citizen Advisers, but it is clear to me unless Government is going to stop this, there is not much help we can get out there. In meantime, I will report this to Gov.uk as some of you suggested. In regards to receiving transcript after chatbot conversation, I had it sent to me within few seconds. Good luck to you All!I have added an article from Irish Times:https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/tr…"
"Hello. I have had the same experience with 4 flights. I went around in a loop looking for ways of getting a cash refund, as the website indicates that this is possible, but says you will be placed in a queue. as far as I can see, there is no way, at this time, of requesting a refund. Chatting to their bot is a waste of time.https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/tr…"
Which adress did you email?
"Booked a ryanair flight on 9th January for April, and on the 22nd March was advised this flight was cancelled. On 24th March a full refund (not a voucher) was sought. Confirmation confirming full refund request recieved along with this note ""Once approved your refund request will be processed within 20 working days to the original form of payment and should show in your account within the next 5-7 working days. A confirmation email will be sent to the address provided in your booking."" Received 2 separate e-mails advising my ""Refund"" was being attended to. Then 19 April, I am emailed a voucher advising this can be redeemed over the next 12 months !!! Just off the ryanair chat service - they were pushing hard on the vouchers. When advised that payment will only be made after Covid-19 has been settled !!!!!, and a voucher would be in my interest. I asked the agent if he could guarantee that ryanair will be in business by the end of this. Reason: a voucher is worthless if they go bust. The Agent was frank saying he could not give me this assurance. I therefore once again insisted upon a refund. Interestingly he was unable to give me a reference or a e-mail confirmation my refund or or discussion. I am firmly of the opinion ryanair is now in financial trouble and will go bust before this is over. There is no other explanation as to why they are doing this.This is imho fraud as they have broken a contract, like others on hear I will be getting onto my credit card provider next. Suggest of your in this boat you do the same.Edited: 11:58 am, April 19, 2020 "

"This was my worry when I managed to get through on the phone this morning, he spoke broken English which made it even more difficult to understand. It just told me that he would put my refund request through but would have to wait until after covid-19 had been settled. I booked my flights last October and received my first message 13th March 2020. All attempts to ask for a refund on their website proved so difficult due to robotic errors I eventually messaged them to get a reply I received further emails 16th March and 17th March advising they'd waive the flight fee if I changed flights huh!!! 25th March I had another email stating my flights had cancelled etc etc. It’s so frustrating. I will get in touch with my credit card tomorrow."
"""I am firmly of the opinion ryanair is now in financial trouble and will go bust before this is over.""They're probably one of the most financially stable European airlines."
"the law has NOT changed. If they cancel your flight you are entitled to a REFUNDRyanAIr are refusing to cancel Car Parking bookedthrough them, they say you can still park !!!!!"
I have had exactly the same!! There is a link supposedly to say you want a refund but it only goes on to explain the voucher.. are you phoning?? I also feel they are deliberately trying it on because it’s easier to just accept good luck
"""But that didn't have anything to do with booking direct either.""I agree. It is all about the airline in this case. Last time I checked, Ryanair is nowhere comparable to JAL."
Your welcome :-))) lets hope it works
Has anyone actually had any luck with getting the money back from a credit card provider or PayPal? I've claimed a refund for 5 flights with them and I'm affraid they will send me vouchers.
"I should have been flying today,flight delayed been waiting for a refund since March 15 have the emails to say I'm in a que got on to live chat 07/04 to be told I have to be patient it's been processed,another email 10/04 to say I'm in a que,contacted Rynair 15/04 as it had been a month only to be told it was cancelled on the 10/04 I now have to start the process again,disgraceful service got your money and want to hold on to it."
"Yes, this is my exact scenario too! i assumed 2 weeks ago that i was getting a straightforward refund but have just had the same email as you. There is no form to submit on the website other than the same form that i submitted 2 weeks ago. Very frustrating."
"same here, absolutely raging at this moment in time.i promised myself i would never use ryanair again last year only did it because i was already abroad and wanted to get home early because of the virus.they still cancelled it"
Brilliant. I've just taken the same approach - here's hoping for a resolution.
"Ryanair owe me for three flights, soon to be a few more. I registered for a refund but have now been offered a voucher. When you click on the 'if you want a cash refund' link on the email you get directed to their 'how to use your voucher' page.It is outrageous that we now have to ask for a refund again having already done so on a system that kept refusing to recognise our flight details. I agree that this is surely illegal. The one thing that is certain is that, no matter how cheap, I will never use Ryanair again."
Hi I am having trouble too getting my refund dated 23rd march
"Exactly the same for us, had two emails apologising for the delay & now a voucher. Says click here for refund & then just loads of information about using your voucher or chat facility you cannot get through to."
Just filled that government form in thanks
"I have quit a few fligts that have been cancelled by my Irish 'friends' of Ryanair. First case: a flight 2020/22/03. Last friday i receiverd the famous voucher instead of th cash refund i have been asking for.I have tried to chat with a customer representative. On saturday i did not manage to get hold of someone. This morning (monday) i could speak to a customer service agent after a 15 minutes waiting period. The person was quite rude & the chat was closed abruptly. I was not impressed and tried again. Only minutes later i got hold of another customer service agent, this time a British representative. They understood my situation but were pushing towards that voucher. The chat was abprupted once again. Third trie was succesfull. After about 30 minutes i got in touch with a a very friendly, no nonsense and straight forward agent. She confirmed my request was added to the cash refund queue and refunds will be granted once the flight shedule is resumed. Will I ever get that refund? Don't know. I took a screenshot of our conversation and we will see. In my experience it hughly depends on the customer agent that you can get hold on...and you have to keep on trying. After all, Ryanair is a solvent company with a solid financial balance and loads of cash. Good luck to you all!Edited: 6:05 am, April 20, 2020 "
"hi, on what basis can you claim via the credit card? just wondering if we can do the same. we are a group of people who paid €2,000 in total"
"Following. Same thing, and super confusing on how to get money back (rather than refund, if even an option). I didn't think that was legal, either. Keep me/us posted. Thanks!"
I have had the same voucher AND I AM NOT HAPPY
This morning I rung 03301007838 (local rate) and after being on hold for 30minutes someone picked up and processed my refund. I wasn''t given a date when will my money be returned to my credit card but he told me than he refused the voucher for me and requested for cash refund.
Idem!
"I'm in the same boat as you. I asked for a cash refund, they kept sending reminder emails for 3-4 weeks that they were processing the request. Then today I received an email with a travel voucher. A voucher which I did not ask for and can not use regardless. I tried phoning them but it states the lines are too busy and hangs up. I've been waiting on an online advisor for hours and nothing. I feel like I've been scammed. I even had the highest insurance option ticked on both flights. Why would they give a travel voucher without giving me us an option in the email to request a cash refund instead. To have to go through all these steps on top of that? Can you let me know any updates if you managed to get the cash refund or if they responded. Thank you"
"We are the same. Requested a refund a few weeks ago and several emails telling us that it would be processed in due course. However, today I get a voucher and no sign of my previous cancelled booking anywhere. I have tried to call but I don’t have the time to hold for an hour. I do not want a credit as I have other flights booked in the year. It is difficult times but they should t offer a refund and then give you a credit note. I am also not happy with Ryanair service"
"I've been in a queue for the webchat all weekend, in a queue again today. It's a joke!! I think the only way is to go to the credit card and get a charge back."
"If you don't use the full value of the voucher, you lose the remainder!!"
Yes the slick thing is they waited extactly 30 days before sending the voucher which is after the credit card refund period in most cases.
"It seems like the only option is to reach them either by phone or by the live chat. I have been in the live chat queue for 5 hours now and am still waiting. I will stand all day and try again tomorrow otherwise. I have also sent an email to them, with no response yet.I think this is very tragic and I really wonder what goes on inside the heads of those deciding to give us vouchers instead of cash refunds. Seems like they are panicking. They will hopefully realise soon that they are shooting themselves in the foot. I do not think many of us who have been scammed will ever fly with Ryanair again."
The same thing happened to me. Got the email today. I applied for a refund on 18th March. I am furious. People need the money in these difficult times. We dont know what position we will be in financially in 12 months time. I dont want a voucher I have 2 more flights booked with ryanair in june and july. I dont want vouchers for all of them
"""Yes the slick thing is they waited extactly 30 days before sending the voucher which is after the credit card refund period in most cases.""Not sure where you got that from but it isn't the case in most countries."
Me too. Applied for refund weeks ago. Got several emails assuring me it was being processed. Finally received response last week with a voucher attached. They said I didn’t have to accept it but gave no direction on how to. I got through to their customer services team who have now put me on a refund waiting list. It sure this is legal but struggling for what else to do.
What did your bank say about it?
"Hi just to let you know I’ve tried the live chat!!! There is nobody live to speak to it is a ROBOT and you keep going round in circles, good luck! I’ve got a number to contact them on which isn’t a rip off premium number which is 0330 1007838"
"Hi I was feeling rather smug went I got to the Ryanair ChatBot/Flight Cancellation, Clicked on a REFUND link that took me back to my Ryanair login, my head then disappeared up my a**e!!I guess that I leave it for a month. Like you, I do not want a voucher"
"Hi all, If you go onto their facebook page there is a ""new way to chat with Ryanair link"", I found it by accident but you can request a cash refund through this way. It's basically an automated chatbot that needs your details and puts you into a queue for a cash refund in place of the voucher - 120 day wait time advised but at least we will get our cash back eventually."
I have had the same issue with Ryanair. I spoke to AMEX as I used their card to pay for the flights. They have refunded me the money and opened a dispute with Ryanair
"I booked direct with Ryanair and I applied for refund 4 weeks ago, a couple of reassuring emails from Ryanair in between and hey presto I've received a voucher today that I don't want"
"Same situation as everyone else on this thread. I rang the 033010078386 number and had to hold for around 45 minutes but eventually got through to an agent who has manually requested a cash refund for my payment. As for when this will come - when the COVID situation is over - god only knows what that means, but fingers crossed..."
"They are only offering vouchers!!Like 132, I paid using my credit card and will claim via that route.Good luckEdited: 8:20 am, April 20, 2020 "
"Hi All,Does anyone know what happens if you don't use the full value of the voucher (in case the flight you book is cheaper than the one you booked initially). Will you lose the remaining money or does it add up as credit?"
"Same here. Just got the voucher, link to get a cash refund does not allow to request that and I was on chat from 9 am to 9 pm yesterday and was not able to talk to an agent at all :("
"Absolutely shocking behaviour i am the same as everyone else here are received the voucher today when it clearly says on their website ""Refunds will be processed, within 7 working days, back to the form of payment used for the original booking.""https://www.ryanair.com/sk/en/useful-info/help-centre/faq-overview/flight-cancellations/How-do-I-request-a-refund. I have submit a covid 19 complaint to your gov. cant get through to credit card as clearly also have long wait times."
Best of luck with live chat I was on there today for 30 minutes with no one coming on line
"No guarantee re 120 days ... first it was 7 working days then 28 working days. I have more flights in May that haven’t been cancelled yet so the line about “ until the Covid crisis is over” is more bullsh1t otherwise all flights would be cancelled now for the foreseeable..Edited: 9:09 am, April 20, 2020 "
"I have the same problem, waiting on the Live Chat for almost 2 hours and nothing has happened yet.I wrote them 4 weeks ago, 2 weeks ago and got the same respond that yes, my request is in the process and I will get my money back. But I got the voucher instead of it. I want money, no voucher."
"Hi, Just to say I have just managed to get one step further than the ""chat-bot"" and maneged to correspond with an agent (whopee). He/she tried to persuade me to utilise the voucher with a number of reasons:I understand you wish to be refunded instead of voucher, however there are many benefits to the voucher:- Easy Access – customer can redeem their vouchers through our online channel – webpage and RYR app- Timelines - 12 months to redeem their voucher, customers can book their flights for the following year/s few days before voucher expires (*only flights available at the time of booking)- Additional Services- customers can use their vouchers to add priority boarding, seats, fast track, luggage etc.- Partial use - customers can partially use their vouchers not the entire amount at ones- Unlimited locations – customers can travel on any routes and to any locations that are under Ryanair Group: Lauda/Ryanair DAC, Ryanair UK, Buzz and Malta Air- Flash Sale flights – customers can redeem their vouchers at any sales flights ie. €1 seat sale, they can purchase 100 x €1 seat sale with their vouchers. (not including Erasmus or Spanish domestic discounts).- However, I stuck to my guns and told him/her that I didn't want the voucher and put me in the refund queue. So that is now done. He/She did go on to say that even though I was in the ""queue"" the voucher was still valid until the repayment was made. So some headway."
https:/…This news item from Euroweekly explains how to best Ryanair at there game. Gov.uk website is cited because we can go to small claims pay around £80 which is a case you WILL win NO question. Ryanair have 14 days to respond legally and you also receive your £80 back. It's the best solution I found to these criminals. Best them at their own game
"Have subsequently also submitted a complaint containing all of the details so that I have an audit trail, as the adviser I spoke to was unable to e-mail any confirmation that the request was submitted as she had to put a manual request for refund against my booking"
"I have just requested a refund from my credit card, Capital One"
I have tried for a long time to get through but cant i just want my money not a voucher
"Same situation as many others in this thread, I bought my tickets Oct 2019 for GBP 447.38p via UK RBS Master Card (Credit Card). Applied for 'REFUND' 26 Mar 2020 on notice of flight cancellation. Given the same Ryan Air wait and delay emails. Voucher 'offer' arrived today 20 Apr 2020 for GBP 409.40p less that what I payed (suspect this is baggage and carbon difference, from earlier thread) called my credit card company who advised. 'Ryan Air are offering you a refund and you can pursue that'. When you get the funds back you can make a claim to us for the difference."" Summary my CC company will not refund me, will expect me to claim a refund and wait. I will now reject the voucher offer with Ryan Air, via any practical means and continue to make the refund claim. When this is over, I will think very long and very hard about giving any of my hard earned money over to anyone in advance. The air transport component emergency of COVID-19 emergency will I strongly suspect last many, to many many months well into 2021 and we here may not see Ryan Air or any of it's monies given back to us. Legally we are covered for the 'what' (cash back), the risk we carry now is the 'when' (what date do I get my money back).... Those who need the cash to live, pay down debts or have lost their jobs are the worse affected.... Yours very miffed and plainly disappointed indeed."
this does not tell me If I can get my money please rectify thank you and how will I get it a will take this further if I cant get an answer
"""Summary my CC company will not refund me, will expect me to claim a refund and wait.""You need to file a section 75 claim with RBS."
sorry but I cant find the voucher on my email could you resend please
"Edith, this isn't Ryanair. You'll need to contact them if you need anything resent."
Hi Everyone I am also having the same problem with my refund I keep getting palmed off with emails and now got a voucher. I have no idea how to get my refund because when you try to call no one wants to help. Do you think it would be in our best interests for all of us to put our bad experiences on Facebook to show others that they're not alone in the struggle because this might help Ryanair or even press to see how they're treating people..I will never fly with Ryanair again even if it's free
same i paid January nearly £3oo email to confirm refund to my card then email today after 4 weeks with voucher joke cant get hold of them
"same position as all above, going round in circles trying to find a way of telling ryanair that i wont accept their voucher and want a refund on both my flights. Waited for live chat from 11.35 until 14.35 and then gave up! not sure what else to do. I also had flights with easyjey for the end of the month, phoned customer service and got through in 5 minutes, money is in my account so well done easyjet."
"I presume, Lexexpress at post 149. you mean at Section 75 section d, 'that the debtor (the claimant) has taken reasonable steps (also doesn't need to litigate) to pursue the claim against the supplier (Ryan Air) but has not obtained satisfaction for his claim.'The question: What is a 'reasonable' time to wait for a refund until after COVID-19 Emergency is over to obtain satisfaction?Law extract below; 75A (1) If the debtor under a linked credit agreement has a claim against the supplier in respect of a breach of contract the debtor may pursue that claim against the creditor where any of the conditions in subsection (2) are met.(2) The conditions in subsection (1) are:(a) that the supplier cannot be traced,(b) that the debtor has contacted the supplier but the supplier has not responded,(c) that the supplier is insolvent, or(d) that the debtor has taken reasonable steps to pursue his claim against the supplier but has not obtained satisfaction for his claim.(3) The steps referred to in subsection (2)(d) need not include litigation"
I have received the same today and I am furious. I went through the process of asking for a refund on two separate bookings and they have sent a voucher. AS you said when you go onto the contact link it looks as though you may have to apply again. Dont know where to go with this now. Just when I thought they were going to do the right thing !
Me to just today after a protracted wait after requesting a cash refund from a month ago they now send a voucher and a tenuous link to there website that offeres no help or contact e mail what a disgrace this company is.O leary your a Chancer
"Same here, I thought my refund was all being processed but just been issued a voucher instead of a refund. The problem with the voucher is I don't know then this will all be over with so how do I know when to book again, plus we are tied to kids holidays. Now I'm sitting in a chat queue, which will take forever. Really disappointed with Ryan air."
"Hi ,Just finished the form from link above. We all should do it!!! It took me 3 minutes.This is what I got at the end: ""Your report has been sent to the Competition and Markets Authority. They will not respond to individual reports but are monitoring all the information provided and will take actions where appropriate.""Hope soon will get my money back."
"Update to my two earlier posts:I called Ryan Air 03301 007838 Option 6 at 1440hrs and got an answer at 1510hrs (30mins later) spoke with Aiman after security validation checks, She has lodged my Flight reference Number as rejecting the voucher offer, I remain waiting for a refund. No email offered but she gave me her 'Agent No'. I asked when will the refund be processed, she explained 'when it is safe to return to work to process them in a timely manner'. I make the assumption, like many of us that Ryan Air are also working from home and need financial oversight in the actual office to process the claims. A note on the UK law. It appears that if ( a big if!) Ryan Air go bust, more longer term, you can still claim off your credit card company."

"Thanks @desajuno86...tried calling and after about 38 minutes, got through and the gentleman said I could get a refund. Odd, as it seemed too easy, but we'll see if my CC gets refunded. Thanks for your advice!"
Exactly the same for me
"Hiya, i am in the same boat. I too received an email for a voucher rather that a refund, which i asked for. I am trying to phone them, but no luck. Waited over 45 minutes on the phone still no answer."
"Hi there, same story here.Did you get the money back through your credit card. Just asking before I start the process....Thanks for your helpAnn"
"I've had exactly the same experience with Ryannair. I requested a refund when they cancelled my flight on 25 August. On 9 April the date of my flight they still hadn't paid me back so I called and they said it was taking time to get through the volume of requests (you would expect it to be a simple algorithm e.g. if flight cancelled = refund). I got the email today 20 April saying I would get a voucher to spend with them but there was a link in the email if I was unhappy to contact them. I tried that chatbot which didn't respond in two hours, I called them and after 35mins of being on hold they answered. The representative told me they have 28 days to pay me back from my initial request (25 March) and I will get full refund now. We shall see if they stay true to that!"
Been on live chat last 5 hours I actually dont think anyone there to sort very angry my refund sorted 4 weeks ago 3 emails stating full refund now a voucher just a waiting game
"Same here, waited 3 weeks and received a worthless voucher instead o f the cash refund requested. The voucher only lasts 12 months and who,s to say when it I’ll be safe to travel again!"
"From what I am reading, it doesn't seem to matter when the flight was cancelled nobody is getting anything. Mine was cancelled in March, others in February...why haven't they refunded anybody? I can understand them having problems as time goes on but from 2 months ago? No wonder they have a bad reputation. I've been waiting 4.5 hours for an agent to chat with me."
Glad to hear we are all in the same boat but its awful! I have received my voucher today after submitting my REFUND form some weeks ago now. I actually managed to get in contact with Ryanair this morning to ask about my refund and they said 28 days after the form was received. Then not long after that conservation the voucher appeared in my inbox. I am currently on hold to them 30 minutes in with no response..... very bad Ryanair. Hoping they will not get away with this if other airlines are being more forthcoming.
161. Thanks for the link. I have completed and sent this too as received the same email today
"Thank you to the OP for starting this thread and thanks, also, to the information from @Denmark1970 (post #9). After five weeks of waiting, with the odd perfunctory e-mail in between, asking me to bear with them, due to the 'unprecedented high volume of requests', Ryanair has sent an e-mail advising me that I'll be getting a travel voucher. What a surprise!I've immediately used the link provided by @Denmark1970 (again, thank you) and reported Ryanair as a business behaving unfairly during the Covid-19 outbreak. I've no time to use the Chatbot today but it's on my list as a priority task for tomorrow. They're definitely not playing their stupid on-time fanfare for timely refunds are they?!!"
I received the same message having been informed that my refund for £400 was being processed in a queue. I don’t want a voucher because I don’t know if I want to fly anywhere in the next 12 months- does anyone?
"Me too. A voucher for £280. Have flights booked for June, August, September and October booked with them, so why would I want a voucher. Completed GOV.UK form as suggested by fellow ""poster"""
Bgoodluck I waited an hour on chat. When someone answered an I mention refund.. He straight away went an sent an response to chat.. I never got to chat
Ditto . After waiting 4 weeks I today received a voucher I dont want. I have been trying to contact my credit card company to process a chargeback but that s also proving difficult. They are pulling the piss as usual. I logged a complaint via their complaint portal and will contact the aviation authority next week as this is a complete violation of our consumer righrs . I would suggest if we all bombard the aviation authority with complaints about this any some overpaid civil servant will have to get off their fat arse and do something. Does anyone have Minister Ross contact details.....He should be dealing with this
"Martin Lewis will hopefully get involved tooEdited: 11:55 am, April 20, 2020 "
"I am waiting 5 hours so far on that live chat...nothing!!!Edited: 12:00 pm, April 20, 2020 "
Exactly the same situation has happened in our case. Refund application sent in and 2 e-mails confirming receipt of said application explaining a delay. Now a voucher to use. I have spent many hours at the end of a telephone trying to ring the customer care team. Obviously no-one answers. I have used the on live chat facility on Ryanair website a few times. This resulted in a one way conversation from myself. No one alive at the other end. Hung on for some response from about 3 hours and over 7 hours with no response whatsoever. Wild horses could not drag me to ever use Ryanair again. Flights were my surprise birthday present for my birthday paid for with my son's debit card. We are left with a voucher we do not want and apparently no comeback to Ryanair's bullying methods of not helping their customers whatsoever in this crisis. Disgusting treatment.
"DId you have any luck with refund with a debit card? I am in the same situation as you, with 4 flights cancelled and an unwanted voucher received today."
"Hi,Same situation here: Applied for a refund for 3 bookings 4 weeks ago, received vouchers today.But I made it through the chat (in German) after 1 hour and in the second attempt, there was a competent employee who told me that everyone receives a voucher first (although applied for a refund). I ask her to transfer the money back to my credit card and she forwarded the booking numbers to their ""headquarters"" for refunding. BUT this can only be done after the pandemic due to working from home and security regulations. That will be done out of Ireland. So it hopefully starts when people in Ireland are allowed to go back to the office."
"Did you eventually find the contact details for Minister Ross? My lawyer husband’s first reaction was to contact the Irish CAA, so am going to do that now."
This needs to be escalated. What is the point of offering you the choice of refund if they were not going to follow this through. So many people have been affected. This is a situation that is out of our control. Many people have perhaps lost their jobs and need that money back!! Perhaps looking into the aviation complaints organisation may help!
use their face book page and messages. A series of questions appear as you answer them you get to the part where you can request a refundhttps://www.facebook.com/ryanair/
"Hi ALL,I also applied for a refund a month ago but I haven't received any emails since then and I also don't have a confirmation email that I applied for the refund. So I practically have nothing in my hands. I had to fill an online form and that was it. I was 100% sure that they will send me a confirmation that my refund request is in progress but none of that happened... When I tried to fill the form again, it said I already had applied for a refund.Was it the same for you?My flights had been on 19+23 March and I paid with Apple Pay (debit card)."
Same happened to me. Got an email with a voucher today despite requesting a refund 20 days ago and receiving 2 emails confirming it was being processed. Managed to speak to “Andrew K”on online chat after waiting 50 minutes. His response was all the payment agents are at home due to Covid 19 and unable to process refunds. He said he could request the voucher is cancelled but I won’t get a refund until “Covid 19 is over”. I asked him to cancel the voucher and email me copy of the chat as proof. I am now going to try to claim back from my credit card. I will never use Ryanair again.
I’m in the same boat as you asked for refund got a voucher there not bothered they just want to keep your money
"If it is true these agents are working from home then giving refunds could be a problem. Would you want your credit card details to be given/stored on a workers computer at home. Could be open to fraud. I’m surprised there is no one working in their offices, but it’s a good way of helping with cash flow if tickets are not refunded.I had heard that if tickets are sold as non refundable then all refunds have to be done manually as the reservation system can not refund a non refundable ticket automatically. This may explain the long delays.Edited: 12:53 pm, April 20, 2020 "
I have also completed the bad practices form on the site GOV.UK. I think we understand it's a bad time for everyone but Ryanair don't help themselves by being so disrespectful to customers
"I too had a flight cancelled, they offered a swap or a refund, like most others I took the refund on 20th March - EU law at that point and still I believe was that they had to provide a refund within 7 days. The sent emails stating that due to the situation they would take longer, then the voucher, valid for 1 year (so not really a year as we are all still locked down) no easy way to get your cash. I am still waiting after over 50 minutes on the web chat, in that time I have managed to speak to my credit card provider and open a section 75 - the law is clear, we all need the money and so I have left it with the card provider. I suggest you do the same as Ryanair clearly not to be trusted"
"hi there, I have also just received the same email from Ryan Air offering me a voucher, we had 9 flights cancelled so a considerable amount of money, does anyone know where we stand? Or where we go from here, as there does not seem to be anywhere to go on Ryanair website, going to try CC company tomorrow see if I have any luck there."
"Same here. Have waited over 20 days for a refund and got a voucher instead today . Have been waiting on ''live chat'' since 13.02 today and I'm still in the queue. I have submitted a complaint to Ryan Air, the minister for transport ( useless waste of space) and the EU while I have been waiting .If I could get through to my credit card company I would be asking for a chargeback"
"They ask for sensitive information in a facebook messenger chat, would that be safe?"
"I am sadly in the same boat as all of you. Tried to contact them on the phone and eventually getting through and being on hold for an 1 hour and 5 mins at 13p a minute that is, they cut me off. I did get a response from them on Twitter a few weeks ago when flights where being cancelled, so I’m going to try that again. Very disappointed, I will also be contacting my bank to see if they can help."
"Hi, I had the same problem as everyone else. I asked for a refund almost 3 weeks ago of my fight on the 17th April which was of course canceled and I just received a voucher that I did not even ask for. Anyone managed to find a solution to this or a link to request a refund AGAIN? Thanks+"
thanks
"I am in the same boat as you, getting a voucher instead of a refund. I have just spoken to my bank (Lloyds) as I paid with my credit card also but been told that they will not chase the refund as a voucher is a valid form of refund from RobinAir and its in their t&c and to try your holiday insurance instead."
I’ve had the same today. Submitted request for refund on 20th March. I’ve now submitted a disputed sale with my credit card company under section 75.
Sent me a voucher offer for only one part of the round trip but both legs cancelled. I cant contact them to get all my money backThey have had plenty of time to sort and despite choosing refund I get this non sense......bloody cowboys
"claim the money with aso called flight refund company some charge 15% max and the problem may be done some coins left, some worries ,tooJan"
Ive done this and we should all do this as they cannot ignore a million complaints for a large corporate that they wish to save!!
"My impression is that this refund ""issue"" is going to be hard to resolve, because1) ryanair are playing for time (the longer it drags, the fewer the people who persue the ""cash refund venue"". Gain for them. And, clearly, neither EU nor individual governments are willing to force their hand because2) it's in their interest for people to get refunds, if only for this fact that up to 70% of my total ticket price is government taxes, levies, charges, fees, etc.3) banks and credit card companies are not interested, because thousands of such claims means work (to them), and work means cost (to them), and in the end, it is no gain (to them) at all (same as insurance, easy to take out, a massive pain to actually claim and get the money). Whatever they say in bright, cheerful slogans about how they care about their customers, blah, blah, blah, is just bull(…) - THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND. And they’ll use ANY excuse to get rid of your claim (""in our assessment, refund constitutes reasonable alternative to cash"" or ""given the current, unprecedented situation, and that the party promised to provide refund, albeit in unspecified timeframe, we regretfully inform you..."").4) lawyers MIGHT be interested, because in case of joint action, out of whatever millions' worth settlement (if at all), they would pocket 90% or so. And the claimants will, eventually, get peanuts (in vouchers, most probably ;)And, frankly speaking, given it’s Ryanair, even if I go through that chatbot and get through to a “representative” and they will, despite their best efforts (can’t blame them) log me as “non-voucher – refund claim” – what chance there is they actually log me? What chance do I have, 5 months down the line, with no money coming, to provide screenshots of that online chat (to whom?). So, in the mantime, I'm going to make a claim under section 75, and yes, ultimately, when my dear bank tells me to take a hike, and ryanair keep dragging their heels well into summer, I will take the route via small claims court in the UK, because I will not let this smug (…) get my money for nothing. Unless the uk government, intensely lobbied, on doubt, caves in to airlines and introduces legal changes that yes, airlines and others _can_ legally provide vouchers instead of refund. Everything is possible :("
they did the same to me how and were do you access these vouchers
I had same email but I don't want to fly anywhere so how do I ask for the money there is not where to ask for it
"Section 75 everyone who paid by credit card, they offered the refund option to me on 20th March, EU law is that they refund in 7 days and hence this is unreasonable and section 75 kicks in. BTW I have left the Ryanair chatbot open while I completed my section 75, wrote a few emails, had tea etc and that was 2 and a half hours agoi, still no response, don't trust Ryanair to give you your money back just go to the credit card provider"
"Hi all, I'm in the same situation. I've tried using Facebook Messenger and posting on their wall to get a response; nothing as of yet. I've tried calling and given up after a long wait and awful hold music. I think this should be passed to some kind of consumer watchdog to try and force the issue. Because what they are doing is plain wrong."
"I've had the same problem been sent a voucher code instead of a refund, when you click the link nowhere to apply for a refund, I think the government should step in and force ryanair to refund customers the money, I haven't worked for 4 weeks with no money like most people, shame on you Michael O'Leary! Your probably sitting in your mansion counting the thousands of ponds of interest your making on our money!!! MICHAEL O'LEARY CON MAN!!!!!!!!"
"Seems like Ryanair have conned us all here. The most annoying thing for me is that I didn’t see it coming. I mean it is RYANAIR after all. They offered a link on their website to claim a refund for flights that they cancelled, whilst saying this may take a while, taking advantage of the whole “we’re all in this together” vibe, so obviously we’d be very understanding in the circumstances. So they buy themselves some breathing space while all our money is gathering interest in their bank accounts. Meanwhile we are getting reassuring emails telling us they’re so busy but it is in hand and will be dealt with eventually. How stupid were we to believe Ryanair!BTW no wonder the one guy in their office is busy they’ve furloughed all their staff so us tax payers have to pay for them. While we all sit in telephone queues waiting for days on end to get through to the one guy they are obliged to keep answering the phone.So now they send us a VOUCHER that can only be used with Ryanair!! Genius!! Obviously this was the plan all along. So now the onus is placed back on each and every one of us to have to get in touch with them AGAIN if we want a proper refund. Absolutely no means of replying to their email. A link on the email that acknowledges we’re entitled to a full refund (oh yes we can disdain our customers but need to meet the minimum obligations for the regulators, because obviously we’ll want some kind of tax-payer funded bail-out at the end of all this) but no means to claim the refund unless you want to waste several hours of your life in a queue for customer services. These ever-so-clever execs have calculated that with each obstacle thrown in our way, with each level of difficulty, more and more of us will simply give in because we value our own time more than the price of the flight. Search for “Euroweeklynews Ryanair refund” and they suggest using the small claims court to get your refund because you are guaranteed to win the case and Ryanair will have to pick up the £80 fee as well as compensating you. With any luck O’Leary and the rest of these parasites will go bust and the planes and staff get snapped up by a responsible operator…"
Same here. i paid the booking in Jan 2020 and now i was given a voucher. no thanks. I raised a charge back from Credit card company. will see what happens. Never book with Ryanair again.
"we all could together order beer on the next flights. when they ask to pay we show vouchers.. millions together ...1 million beers , cokes, coffees.. sandwiches .. voucher, please charge me on code 21345789 !!that would workhow to move 1000000 customers 2020 and 2021 ???"
"repost it, facebook, tripadvisor, twitter.. everything on social accounts...order food and drinks and show voucher on Ryanair, Easyjet, condor, volotea.. all disgusting airlinenrevolution to claim our rightsarder all, show voucher, no cash !!!"

"As an update, I used the monesavingexpert Resolver website to pursue a refund and I just received the following response from Ryanair…STARTWe apologise for the cancellation of your flight FR4028 on the 23/03/2020, which was due to the current worldwide COVID 19 crisis.As per interpretive guidelines on EU passenger rights, announced by the EU commission on cancellations caused due to COVID 19, this is now classified as an extraordinary circumstance and compensation does not apply under EU261/2004.If you are not satisfied with the voucher that you were notified about on the 20/04/2020, we kindly advise you to contact us directly via chat or by phone. One of our agents will be happy to help you.You can also contact our Customer Care Centre by using number 0330 1007 838.Our lines are open:Mon – Fri: 0800 – 1800 GMTIf you remain dissatisfied with the final decision made from our customer services team, you may contact the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and their Passenger Advice and Complaints Team (PACT). Please follow the link: We hope the above clarifies the matter and we have now closed your claim.ENDSo all of the customers waiting hours to get through to Ryanair for a refund, are basically being told we are no longer obliged to refund you and if you’ve got a problem with that, complain to the CAA. Every other company has refunded me for my cancelled trip, Easyjet, AirBnb, Premier Inn, Expedia, Trainline, Megabus. But RYANIR no.If you are happy being taken for a mug like this, continue to use RYANAIR, otherwise wise up and use the only power you have as a consumer and that is to refuse to use this excuse for an airline."

"I requested a refund for 2 flights that were cancelled , they cancelled one flight so I had to book new tickets £700 to get home or be stuck in Lanzarote for 3 weeks (next available flight ) ,when we were about to board the flight they turned away around 50 passengers in the queue including me , they had overbooked the flight ! ... I have just had an email saying that due to Covid 19 they will not be giving a refund or voucher , it was an exceptional circumstance! Where do I go with that ? It’s taken a month to get that response, yet some people are being offered a voucher ?"
"""So all of the customers waiting hours to get through to Ryanair for a refund, are basically being told we are no longer obliged to refund you and if you’ve got a problem with that, complain to the CAA. ""No, the email you received is about compensation, not the right to a refund. Cancellations due to COVID-19 are not compensatable but you still have a right o a refund."
"Hi all, I'm in the same position but paid by debit card. I've seen this tweet that some may find useful, I'm going to try it with my bank tomorrow because I doubt I'm suddenly going to get an agent 8 mins before closing after a 3.5 hour wait...https:/…"
I have reported them but there is no real action that will be taken unless many do the same.
Incorrect I booked directly with Ryanair and they have sent a voucher I did not request
How did you get on Natalie with the live chat and getting your refund?
I’m in the same boat exactly and don’t know what to do next !! Susan Perkin
"Just received exactly the same having had the same reassuring emails that the refund was being processed, I understand that these are extraordinary times but if this was their intention all along I’d rather have not been led down the yellow brick road in the meantime, not happy."
I’ve tried that and it’s just a robot with pre written answers.
"Couple of week ago they said: no problem, we'll refund shortly. Several days after that they reassured me that the refund is in progress, it'll just take a little more time to complete.Of course, no problem, I do understand that the situation is extraordinary, no rush at all...But! Now they've sent a voucher instead of refund, expecting me to either accept it as is, or try to contact them somehow in case I don't want to accept it, providing a link to an unrelated webpage, fully realizing that contacting Ryanair is now a ""mission-impossible task""!Really??? Such a scam, shame on them. I expect they'll go bankrupt. Not because of the virus, but because they threat customers like a sh..t. I'll personally will never ever buy tickets from them again."
"That email was in response to my claim for a REFUND, I never even mentioned compensation. Maybe that is just another tactic to make people think that the EU commission ruling means they are not obliged to pay a refund. Of course that is what anyone is going to think when it is a REFUND that they asked for. Regardless, if you contact them to directly request a REFUND and this is their only response, it amounts to the same thing. We're not giving you refund!"
"I got the same email today, I'm really annoyed about it. Going to try and press for refund, i messaged them ages ago as original link for refund kept saying error, I got fed up and sent a snotty email as I work for NHS and was under enough stress with covid daily developements without having to chase a refund, they then sent me a link that worked to submit claim form but now this a travel voucher, Ryanair are a joke."
"By the way as an update, I just submitted a complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA dot co dot uk. You can submit a complaint online although again there are a few hoops to jump through to dissuade you. But at least it is quicker than the 3 years it will take you to get through to Ryanair."
"""Also majority of posts are from members with 1, 2 or 3 posts. Quite strange""Not really. I'm guessing this thread is one of the top hits on Google for people who search for it."
MICHEAL O'LEARY do the right thing for once!! At the moment you are a Massive CON MAN. Come on do the right thing!!
"Hi ,https:/…Just finished the form from link above. We all should do it!!! It took me 3 minutes.This is what I got at the end:""Your report has been sent to the Competition and Markets Authority. They will not respond to individual reports but are monitoring all the information provided and will take actions where appropriate.""I have also done this. More the merrier with this shower"
thank you for this I will try tomorrow
"Forget trying with Ryanair. There are complaints all over twitter, facebook and trustpilot. They won't help you if you even ever get through to anyone. They will just fob you off and you'll waste hours. Get a refund through your credit card company - just say you need a ""Section 75"" - service not delivered, refusing to refund, etc. If you paid by other means then try your bank or paypal and complain to them. People have had success. Then Ryanair have to pay an admin fee to the bank and you'll feel better. Also see post #9 and follow the link and add your complaint to the government - only takes 2 mins and the more complaints the more Ryanair will have to answer to."
"Hi there, same story here. Did you have any joy with your credit card company? Ann"
In same boat. Waited three hours until closing time last night. Now up at 6 am trying again but know I won’t get anywhere
"Did you have any luck? I’m in exactly the same situation, but don’t know how to contact them directly without skme stupid robot!"
I have had the same - how do you actually get a refund ?
Did you get any joy. I just received the voucher yesterday and no joy trying to chat with them from 4pm until they closed at 9pm.
Contacted my credit card company - didn’t do the section 75 that has no time delay - do do the service not delivered and will be paid out in ten days. SoA disputed transaction. American Express have been amazing ....
same here. they actually told me my partner called them and requested a flight change for himself. so only one will be refunded then sent a voucher. now cant get through to them at all
"Same here, they are taking the p***"
This is for a UK government website - Ryanair is based in Ireland so has no jurisdiction.
"I contacted Ryanair via chat and eventually got through this morning (third attempt). Told that the payment agents are not allowed to process payments due to ""payment security restrictions"" re COVID-19. Voucher its valid until the refund is paid."
Wrong. Where they're based is irrelevant. They are subject to UK competition laws like any foreign company that operates in the UK. Fill the form. Force Ryanair to do the right thing and refund its customers. The more the merrier. See post #9 - takes 2 minutes to fill in. 28 days I've been waiting since my refund request submitted - not good enough Ryanair.
Have complained per link provided.
"Hi all, I received vouchers instead of a refund yesterday. I have already complained on the UK GOV website. However, I wonder if if that will help, as Ryanair is an Irish airline and outside the jurisdiction of the UK government. I understand that under these exceptional circumstances, it was quicker for the airline to process a voucher than a refund. I haven't had any joy contacting customer care agents via phone or the chatbox. Everytime I call the number, press #6, I get a standard message ""all customer care agents are busy, please call back later"" ;-(By law, we are entitled to a refund so please hang in there for a few weeks - once the pandemic situation eases, we can request for a refund instead of a voucher.Good luck everyone and I'm sure we will all get back our refunds in a matter of time!"
"I am in the same boat as everyone else. Applied for refund on cancelled flight 3 weeks ago, two ‘dealing with’ emails, then one with the voucher and to click “here”to get a cash refund. Of course no further link to re-apply for the cash refund.I did fill out another refund claim form only to get the message”Unfortunately we cannot process your application because the airline code does not match the airline of any of the flights on this booking” - the flight code I used was FR which correct.Also, I have several future flights with Ryanair but none if these, plus the one I am cancelling, is showing on My Account. Is anyone having the same problems on refund claim form & future flights?"
Well hopefully all these complaints will result in long reaching consequences when Covid is over and Ryanair try go back to normal. Customers need to remember this and make it count with their wallets. Bad customer service cannot be allowed to rule.
What a complete farce. I will echo and repeat everything that has already been said. Give customers 12 months to claim the voucher when no one knows how long we will be social distancing for and there are no flights available? (SCAM 1) Then they state if you want a refund we will not cough up any money until after the Corvid19 crises is over. (what... when they are open for business again) What a bunch of Syhsters this company is. Everyone will be aware that prices will sky rocket when this is all over because of the back log and people desperate to get away. The EU should step in here and demand they pay back hard earned money to people struggling in Corvid19. I'm furious.
Is this a credit voucher or a refund credit voucher ? There is a subtle but important difference between the two . There are a couple of good explanatory articles about the difference between them at https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/discuss… and https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an… - the refund credit voucher is effectively an IOU which can be used to rebook another trip straightaway OR redeemed for cash in a few months
Reported and I advise everyone to do the same.Link again from post#9 https:/…
Yes i have also filled in the link below. GOV.UK Report a Business.
Confirm also completed the government form today after receiving same information from Ryanair.How do we proceed with Ryanair though to get our money back?
"I applied for a refund on the 23rd March, had the 2 processing emails.Last one was on the 9th April.Not had the voucher email yet, expect it some time this week"
I spoke to them yesterday with the same problem you actually get nowhere they say they have put you in a q for refund but not issuing until the pandemic is over with
We have had the exact same problem it is so draining.. was told the refund would be here by end of April/ start of May and now been given the voucher! No way of contacting them obviously so no idea how to go about it and judging but by the hundreds of reviews on trust pilot they’ve got in the last 24hrs it seems like everyone is in the same boat! Hope you get sorted x
"Thank you for this. I have reported them. Very simple process. Please everyone do this, let's help each other."
I have opened a case in Paypal and contacted Ryanair CS chat. they were very quick to offer the money (who knows when this will be in my account) there.
Has anyone seen any news on the reaction by Simon Calder or Martin Lewis to this situation. They surely must have some sort of reaction to this
"Hi Yes experienced the same issue like everyone. Also noted the voucher amount is less than what i paid for my tickets , has anyone experienced the same?"
I got in contact with my credit card company but got no where told me to contact the airline let me know how you got on
"@ Gareth (post 266) - there is , just Google it and you will find things . Here is a link to a Simon Calder article this month https:/…ar-BB12n7W9Edited: 6:42 am, April 21, 2020 "
"Dear all, Great to have this thread and thanks for the email tip, Denmark1970! I have just taken action and also emailed ryanairen@ryanair.com. Hope my template can help you:""To whom it may concern,This communication stands as written evidence of my repeated but unsuccessful request for a full refund of the booking xxx. According to Article 8 in EU passenger rights law, regulation 261/2004, the refund for any cancelled flight must reach the customer within 7 days of this cancelled flight. For this particular booking with an outbound flight date of 10th April 2020, this is the 17th April 2020, 4 days ago as of today. For your reference: https:/…I would like to once again request a swift refund to the payment card with the IBAN: xxx, BIC: xxx, account holder: xxx I will use this written communication for any future legal dispute, collective or individual, against Ryanair for the delayed and by means of repeated evasive emails purposely rendered obscure flight refund process, including any relevant accrual of interest on the amount you owe, xxx Euro, from the 17th April 2020 onwards. Yours faithfully,xxx""Stay safe and let's hope they cut O'Leary's bonus instead of defrauding customers! :)"
"I would regard this as a desperate attempt from an irresponsible airline to circumvent European Law. In the first instance, I suggest to follow their advice and contact them via customerqueries@ryanair.com (I have done the same). If you do not hear from them in max. 4 weeks, you should write to the European Ombudsman (easy to google). If we all do it, Ryanair will get what it is asking for - even more negative press, and hopefully a few thousand customers less when the crisis is over."
Good luck with that I spent 2 hrs yesterday and 3.5 hrs this morning trying to get a refund they said I was in a queue lol don’t think it’s even staffed it’s a disgrace to be treated like this the airline needs customers as much as we need the airline Please post if you have any luck Anne
Hi I got an email today after asking for a refund.. excactly the same... How did u get on with the bank? Wondering if I should do the same as in contact my bank or would I just be wasting my time? Thanks
Same thing is happening with me. I don't know what to do. I have already applied for refund now they are telling me to do it again. Meanwhile the money is sitting in their accounts and they are getting all the bonus. This is what lots of companies are doing now and it sucks.
Has anyone got through on the website chat that they direct you to on the refund email?
Same here...I think we should collectively get this on the news-radio/TV/the papers. Ryanair have not met their legal obligations. They have made it impossible to get a refund by what I consider to be devious means(you ask for a refund-they send you a voucher! the click through for cash refund takes you to their voucher page!). Many people are desperate for that money. Its appalling corporate behaviour at this time
I too received confirmation a refund was on it’s way and then today received the offer of a refund voucher. I went thru the Chat Now/Ryanair Bot and finally got thru to Live Chat with agent Judith J. I was advised of the advantages of accepting the vouchers twice! I replied I would still prefer a cash refund. Surprisingly I was then advised she hadn’t heard from me in a while and was I still connected! Obviously I was and replied again only to be told yet again that there had been no response from me! There was a link to ‘reconnect’. Eventually I clicked on the link and guess what - it doesn’t work! I think this is Ryanair’s way of enforcing people to accept the voucher. Absolute disgrace!
"I had the same. Phoned my bank, requested a chargeback - I paid by debit card. Money back in my account within 24h"
Hi I have two vouchers for 2 flights that i asked for refunds for . I heard on radio that under CAA rules we are supposed to be issued with refund 1 week after cancellation . I’d be taking it uk with them . civil aviation authority
Try contact on live chat using this link below : https:/…
" I too received that same email today after submitting a claim for a refund on 24/3/2020. I have managed to get through to someone on chat and this is what they said""The voucher was sent out as a good will gesture from Ryanair to assure you that the money is yours and in your hands as another option. You are more than welcome to a full cash refund, but until comes this is in your hands as another option for you to utilize""When I explained that my application for a refund a month ago was clear - a refund was required, he responded with:""In this case let me amend your reservation to be refunded by cash""I asked why this was not done in the first place a month ago, how long will it take & i expect it be refund back to my card, not cash. He has confirmed that it will be refunded back to my card and in response to my query as in when will i receive my refund, he said ' Due to social distancing set up by the government, our refund teams must work from home, and because of this they have limited access to customers personal financial information. Once the government eases the social distancing guidelines, and the refund teams are back in office, refunds will be processed according to their normal timeline of 7-10 business days”I have pointed out that social distancing was in placed before I applied for my refund so therefore should not affect it also asked if the staff are working from home and cannot process refunds, what the hell are they doing? He says they are making amendments to reservations. I pointed out many do not want to amend, they want a refund, so who is processing refunds.Getting nowhere, just getting frustrated.Going to do my complaint on Gov.uk"
I tried to get a charge back for my easyJet bookings and did not get much joy with my bank despite having written evidence. The written evidence with Ryan Air refusing to refund my cancelled flight is about as solid as it could be.Has anybody done a successful charge back against Ryan Air and if so which bank. Would be good to see a list of the helpful banks as opposed to the not so helpful in all of this.
Ryan Air are now sending generic emails back from their customer queries email address. Basically redirecting you back to customer online chat where it appears you are fobbed off. It seems the drawbridge is up and their not letting it down any time soon at Fort Ryan.
"To be fair Mystique72 you have received pretty good feedback from the chat compared to other standard responses from Ryanair. Thanks for sharing this. I have just received another voucher, so I have to contact them again tomorrow morning."
Howdid they email you?I can't access theone minute box email they provided. Any idea?
"Good luck with that. You get a robot who can’t answer your question, then go in a queue for a real person and are then abandoned - no response. No luck on the emergency phone no. Either - message says this number not in use!"
"I've got the same problem. I couldn't find anywhere on the website to apply again for a cash refund.I messaged Ryanair via messanger, I was told to fill all my details again, then told I had been placed in a queue for when covid19 is over, I will then receive the refund. Its rubbish. Hope this helps you."
We are in the same situation
"Hi, I've just got off the phone with MBNA. They seemed quite positive and open to claiming back from Ryanair. Claim submitted, they said it would take 20 days to respond."
"Ditto I was offered a refund at the end of March for trip 20th April and acceped. Got an email today saying I can have a voucher, but if I still want refund to ""click here"" on the email which I do and it takes u straight into vouchers there is no way to say refund. Absolutely dreadful."
"I just had a similar conversation with Ryanair (I know, i was able to get through!). i was seeking some details around the vouchers potentially being offer and was advised that should i pursue either section 75 or chargeback that i would not be able book with them in future"
"I have sent a report to this government link and urge everyone affected to do the same it’s really easy.Edited: 10:47 am, April 21, 2020 "
Same problem here in France. I just waited 40 minutes and no one came to chat. I have filed a complaint on the link provided above.
"Hi allI got the same email but i was thinking it was sent to try and convince me to change my mind to using a voucher which i will NOT do. I was thinking because i have already submitted a request for a refund and they have acknowledged it and said i'm in a queue, legally they will HAVE to give me the refund. I think this email about a voucher is just to throw us off but if we play them at their own game and wait, we will get our voucher (what i'm hoping anyways)"
"Hello, everyone! I tried calling the number some of your used, 0330 1007 838, but it's invalid. I don't know if this is an internal number for UK only, as I'm calling from Romania. Are there any other numbers available for customer service? I searched, but came across the above number and 0818 30 30 30, which is also invalid. Please let me know if you have any info that could help.Thank you!"
I requested a refund weeks ago I think everyone will end up with a voucher. Michael is putting us all through some more hoops!!!Is there any other way to request a refund?
"0044 and leave out the first 0 from the number...but that's likely to cost you quite a bit.Edited: 11:50 am, April 21, 2020 "
"For anyone still trying I just got through to their online chat, i.e. real person within 10 minutes who asked if I wanted the refund. He said it should be refunded within 28 days. I did advise them that I have spoken to my Credit Card Company who have said if I don't receive a refund within 15 days of my date of travel, they will issue chargeback, and will be initiating this if I don't receive a refund prior to this. I'm sympathetic to companies and if asked would have waited but don't appreciate the underhand manner so I for one will be doing what I can to get a refund sooner rather than later."
Update all:Tried that number which was posted previously and couldn't get through after half an hour so hung up as it probably costs a fortune. Two hours waiting to chat online and no response. Tried to re-submit my refund request form for that NOT to work either! After reading through the comments i severely doubt if my original request for a refund was ever taken into consideration!! Rang my bank (santander) and explained the situation. As i paid with a debit card i could not receive a chargeback. They also advised me that because the company is still offering a voucher for the full amount they could try to say they are still providing the service they promised. However my bank is still sending me a dispute form to fill out which i will be doing and hopefully i can get my money back that way! i have also made a complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority. If anyone would like to do this here is the linkhttps:/…Have lost the last bit of respect i had for ryanair and will NEVER use them again regardless of how cheap the flight is! No care for their customers whatsoever and are committing FRAUD by saying they will give you a refund and NOT doing this!
I got quite stern with their customer service agent yesterday. Stated I did not accept their offer of a voucher and I must have a refund. Stated my terms that my demand is that the refund must be in my account by 5pm friday. The advisor said he acknowledged that and at which point I stated to him that as he is a representative of Ryan air that he has now formed a verbal contract with myself the customer to refund the funds paid by that time.
"First, contact your Credit Card company and make a dispute. Somehow this will put pressure on Ryanair since talking to an agent is near to impossible task."
"I’ve opened a dispute through my bank RBS credit card. Filled In an online form for three sets of flights and although it initially didn’t work it has now gone in with 7 to 10 days to get back to me. Time will tell, Fingers crossed"
"""I got quite stern with their customer service agent yesterday.""Oh dear. I wonder how much is he getting paid to have to suffer people ""getting quite stern"" with him wen he is just an employee...""Stated I did not accept their offer of a voucher and I must have a refund.""And that is completely within your rights to require that, as I understand the law.""Stated my terms that my demand is that the refund must be in my account by 5pm friday. The advisor said he acknowledged that""Acknowledged that you had demanded that. Yes, I would acknowledge that too."" and at which point I stated to him that as he is a representative of Ryan air that he has now formed a verbal contract with myself the customer to refund the funds paid by that time.""I doubt that he has any power to agree to anything like a verbal contract or that they are even close to being able to refund you by the date and time of your demand, but good luck. I hope it works out for you."
"The same with me. Asked for a refund, which I was granted at the end of March and yesterday I got a mail offering a voucher. I am furious. Any suggestions?Lorella"
"I am in the same situation. I requested a refund and got a mail back to it will be processed and would take 8-10 weeks for the return of the paymentsNo get a mail saying here is your voucher that I do not want.I have tried to live chat was on foe 2 hours and no reply, and then opened another live chat still no reply.I have mailed them requesting that the refund to go back on my credit card.This is a disgrace, government should insist that they give everyone their money back"
Yes same email and regardless of how people have paid the airline is trying to direct all to vouchers which are only valid 12 months. Legally the airline has to provide refunds for cancelled flights within 7 days of flight cancellation.
Their email address is customerqueries@ryanair.com if you need and agreed best to have proof that you’ve formally requested cash and date you submitted the claim.
By law - Denied Boarding EU Regulation (Regulation 261/2004 EC) they have to offer you a choice of Refund or Replacement flight. Ryanair are breaking the Law if they refuse your request for a refund.Write to them stating the Law and insist on a full refund
Get refund from Credit Card provider
Exact same thing with me
"Yes ..just had the same thing too!! I don't want a voucher, I want the cash refund. I'll TRY to get hold of Ryanair tomorrow, but won't hold my breath, couldn't get them this eve!!!"
"Same situation here, filled the form for refund a month ago, 2 emails asking me for patience but assuring they are working on it and now the email offering a voucher. I have been waiting on their chat for 7 hours now and obviously nobody is gonna answer my query, I think this is a premeditated procedure they came up with and is not gonna be a way to contact them. Tomorrow I will try and start the chat again for the whole day leaving the screen on like today but if after their 15 hours shift nobody is replying again, next step will be contacting my bank for the 600€ moneyback. I even told my friends I was very surprised with Ryanair with their good gesture dealing with refunds in quite an easy way, unlike other airlines I had a much harder time, but hey, at the end of the day is Ryanair, too good to be true"
"I shall be contacting my mp tommorrow demanding he do something about ryanair , pointing out that despite paying abta/atol premiums everytime I book a holiday for the past few years and being forced to pay for various EU institutions , who are supposed to stop this sort of thing happening , both have proved less than useless .let's see if he's worth his wage"
"""pointing out that despite paying abta/atol premiums everytime I book a holiday for the past few years and being forced to pay for various EU institutions , who are supposed to stop this sort of thing happening , both have proved less than useless""I think you need to look up what ABTA/ATOL protection is because it sounds like you haven't a clue. And EU rules are why you are legally entitled to a refund which you can enforce through the courts if you wish."
"Same problems for me, I gave up on trying with ryanair and moved the responsibility to my bank via a clause 75 request. Let's see what happens"
"In case anyone was thinking of using the moneysavingexpert Resolver site to try and get the refund they're entitled to from Ryanair, don't waste your time. I did this, uploaded the evidence (emails from Ryanair etc, confirming cancelled flights and that I requested a REFUND and emails reassuring me that they were processing it). Open and shut case, right? Wrong, all I got was an AUTOMATED response from Ryanair and with that the case is CLOSED, with no right of reply!I know the response is AUTOMATED because I requested a REFUND and they quote...""As per interpretive guidelines on EU passenger rights, announced by the EU commission on cancellations caused due to COVID 19, this is now classified as an extraordinary circumstance and compensation does not apply under EU261/2004""...even though I requested a REFUND, not compensation. I guess this is designed to make me think I am not entitled to a refund. Seems Resolver are just another industry sponsored ruse to waste more of our time and beat us into submission.It seems that most airlines are affiliated with an ADR, a voluntary aviation industry body to independently adjudicate customer complaints. But guess what, RYANAIR are the only airline not affiliated, surprise, surprise.So I filed a complaint with the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA dot com. No response yet, but let's see. I urge you all to do so as well and hopefully the weight of numbers gets the message through to the authorities.Ultimately, the only real power we have as consumers is to NEVER USE RYANAIR AGAIN !"
"The same here. I was offered a refund at the end of March for trip 17th April and acceped. Got an email today saying I can have a voucher, but if I still want refund to ""click here"" on the email which I do and it takes u straight into vouchers there is no way to say refund. It is fraud."
"I'm not sure this chargeback claim is going to work - because when your bank approaches the merchant (Ryan Air) bank, they will contest it and simply say we are offering credit vouchers."
"HiI too was notified today by Ryanair that I could swap my hard earned money for some meal vouchers.This is okay if you’re a seasoned flyer with them, where I am not and never will be either. We only had to choose this carrier due to the destination (Seville) so I will fly somewhere else and go the last 100 miles by donkey if I have to, rather than use this excuse of a company.I have today spoken to my credit card company, where they will refund me ( bit of paperwork to fill in) the £400.00 and claim it back off of Paddy airways."
"Is there anyone that was sent the email for voucher but without a link in order to accept it? In one friend of mine, except for the link for refund, there was also an other one about the voucher."
"Hi, I was on live chat first thing but didn’t get nowhere waited on hold for about an hour and half and a man confirmed he refused the voucher and said I will get a refund. Couldn’t give me a time scale though which sucks"
"Same thing here.Just sent the email just for proof, i've waited 4 hrs!!! in chat until they closed and no one answered.i will try tomorrow first thing again. This is a nightmare and believe me when i say NEVER AGAIN RYANAIR."
Nina Warhurst on bbc breakfast this morning reporting the issue across a number of travel and holiday firms.

"Same here told twice by mail rerfund in the Queue and now voucher and nowhere to click for refund although i have mail statingb i would receive, so i just mailed them back and said i will use that mail from, them in court"
I raised a dispute activity with American Express and they refunded the amount immediately without any question. I have found Amex excellent in dealing with these issues.
"In Spain they were denounced because the EU law indicates a 7 day period for refunds and Ryanair told the customers they would take 28 days. And now, after 28 days are passed, we all received this farce.There are other many airlines not offering refunds, but vouchers instead, and apparently the EU is looking elsewhere due to the extreme situation we are in, but hey Ryanair, you already told us you were gonna pay the refund (sooner or later), don't ask us to start the process all over again.Yesterday 7 hours waiting with the chat screen on, today, still waiting and nothing happening. Obviously, we are now thousands of angry passengers trying to reach the customer ""service"" agents on the chat. Good luck all !!If they would have offered an increase on the voucher value like many other airlines did, many of us would have accepted the voucher.https://inews.co.uk/news/consumer/ryanair-re…"
Hi guys . My flights was cancelled and they have sent me a voucher for the flight going abroad but heard nothing on my return flight will this come through seperate ? Thanks xx
"Flight was cancelled on 24th March with the promise of a full cash refund, I actioned this online and received several emails stating they were working on it. I was due to fly 13 April, received an email 2 days ago offering voucher and like everyone else not what I was promised or wanted clicked on the section to decline voucher and action refund, with no option to do anything. Tried live chat and waited all day for a response, surprise surprise it didn’t come. Spent an hour on their customer services number and no answer. Hung * up and contacted my card company. They are breaking the law and should have issued refund within 7 days. I am not an unreasonable person and would happily wait a little longer, given the situation but no customer care at all given by this company"
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52370158
Well I also got 3 vouchers from Ryanair. I phoned my bank yesterday and they returned the money to me with no hesitation. Do not bother calling the expensive Ryanair call centre. Even if you get in touch via the chat they will put you on a waiting list. They are breaking the law. A cancelled flight means an instant refund due to EU 261/2004 and that law has not changed. They say otherwise but is not legal so the bank is obligated to return the money for you.
"Which bank Marjus?Edited: 5:38 am, April 22, 2020 "
Barclays. My friend also phoned her bank (Bank of Scotland) and she got the money back too.
Th chat option is no longer available when I login-though it was yesterday-I waited for 3 hours and got nowhere. I just get the bot who-'does not understand my question'! I think they are making it impossible to get a refund and forcing people to accept vouchers by making the refund option impossible to do. It is so wrong! I am so mad!
Thanks Marjus .. waiting on RBS ... fingers crossed
One consumer expert on radio said if people took their claim to the small claims court for I think £80 it would be refunded along with cost of air tickets because airline would not want to be blacklisted as bad debter.
"""Vouchergate"" update: MoneySavingExpert has reported Ryanair to the Civil Aviation Authority and Trading Standards.https:/…"
"Good luck with that plan, Joanne."
No point wasting time and money contacting Ryanair. Just demand a refund through credit card company and fill out the 2 minute form on post #9 - the government's CMA complaints procedure. Also use twitter to get Martin Lewis on the case. Get the big boys putting pressure on.
Chatbot open and not replied to for nearly 2 days now - please dont bother trying to contact Ryanair via their chatbot - section 75 credit card seems to be the best way
Is this not a criminal act?
Surely this is a criminal act?
"Updating post number 182. We have now received another E-mail from Ryanair stating ""You may have received a refund on your unused booking and this amount would have been refunded to your debit/credit card used to make your booking"" Now basically, as you've received correspondence from Ryanair regarding your refund, our ticket is now closed. Basically that's the end of the story. What a complete rip off."
"@Karen.TIf the email says you have been refunded to your debit card or credit card, why is that a rip off, I don't get it?"
@ Karen.T - not sure what you mean?
There will be more section 75 claims going in over this than toilet rolls coming off the shelves in the early days of corona virus.
Cant get through on chat tried for last 3 days and yesterday started call at just after 8am no answer 7 hours later.Absolute joke company
"I have been sent the same emails for two flights I had booked. Curiously the two flights have now disappeared from my Ryanair account and don't even appear on previously booked flights, even though there is a list of other flights I have taken this year. This sounds like another Ryanair scam. Who should we make an official complaint to? I'll probably have to use Ryanair in the futue, but I simply don't trust them to honour the voucher. I had paid for checked in luggage as well as seat and a 10kg cabin case. I doubt they'll take that into account when I try to book. Does anyone know who we're supposed to contact at Ryanair?"
The first line of the generic e mail says that. I presume it will be sent to everyone eventually. 'May' being the important word. No one seems to have received a refund back on their bank/credit card. I know I haven't. It goes on to say the ticket (refund application) is now closed. In other words I've got my credit voucher and that's the end of it. You can't get in touch with Ryanair to continue with a cash refund. You can't re submit another refund application form. I've tried that.
"Same problem here. The email offering the voucher can be taken 2 ways.....’ can be used for the purchase of Ryanair flights and other services at any time over the next 12 months’.....Does this mean that the flights have to be taken in next 12 months or that the voucher can be used right up to 12 months from now, potentially booking a flight in late 2021. This could be another con from the master conman. Also , nothing to stop them going bust an then starting up again using a different name. How about Conair."
"Hello there, my flights have also disappeared from my Ryanair account on their website, also are gone from the past flights section. I even realized today that only in 2019 and up to March 2020 I have 24 different bookings with Ryanair, well, probably they don´t think I am a valuable customer but I definitely don´t take them as a valuable company any longer after this. I have had the chat window live since yesterday at 15:00, I have contacted them on Spanish customer service Twitter, but I'm not getting any response in either of them. Maybe you could try this number as it has worked for some customers: 0330 100 7838 Good luck with this scam people"
"Its on the Moneysavingexpert newsletter and here:https:/…Edited: 12:07 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"Same here. My flight was cancelled due to Covid-19. On March 24th, I submitted the form for the full refund. Since then I've received 2 communications from Ryanair that my request is in the queue and I should not re-submit my request Yesterday I received another email which contains the travel voucher. Calling them is impossible. I've tried to contacted them via online chat- been waiting for 8 hours !!! so far. What a joke!"
When you go to live chat .. it’s just generic messages that advise you take a voucher OR wait in line after the Covid crisis over. Looks like there’s lots of other dissatisfied customers like me .... we were told the refund would be back in our account within 20 days .... and today offering us a voucher.Saw on the news this morning what they are going is illegal... as per Which consumer advice ...
"I am in the exact same situation, I have filled in the application form but it complaints about the airline code after I have pressed submit, it does not accept it. I waited 4 hours today to get in contact with one of their chat agents. I can see a pattern here. No one wants their vouchers. In the first place I was asked to fill in the form and get a refund, waited for weeks. At that stage I was naïve and thought getting my money back. So annoying! Anyone have any suggestions on how to proceed?"
I have filled in a section 75 to my Access Credit Card. Much quicker than trying to contact Ryanair. The CC company will credit me and Ryanair will have to pay their admin charge. Best way to go.Also a good idea to complain to UK government via the http link in post #9 - only takes a couple of minutes.
Surely it’s time for mr O’Leary to resign
Good luck with that .they say they are connecting you after you've given a full explanation of your query.Except they don't. And they do not acknowledge. Emails or reply either.
"Same situation here , flight cancelled 20th March refund in 7 days etc voucher received on Monday 20th April. I’ve tried the online chat all day today with no response. Took it upon myself to email what I hope is the CEO mailbox directly this evening. Let’s see if I get a reply. I won’t hold my breathSeems a little strange that they can still take bookings but can’t issue refundsThis is the mailbox I sent my request too.  mailto:hutchinsonb@ryanair.comEdited: 4:48 pm, April 22, 2020 "
I too filled in two refund requests for 2 separate flights cancelled by ryanair. I never asked for vouchers. I have received 2 vouchers. There is a supposed option via a link on the voucher page to convert to a refund (again). However the link is useless as the page it sends you to has an explanation of the voucher to refund option but absolutely no way to request it. This is an obvious scam by Ryanair to make refunds unavailable. It is time for governments to step in for consumer protection as the laws in the EU and North America are very clear on the obligation to provide refunds in the type and manner the charges were paid for.
Your thinking out loud is an accurate thought. In Canada Mastercard will NOT proceed on a charge back if you even acknowledge that you have been offered a voucher (which is contrary to Mastercard's own rules). A Canadian airlines complaint advocate states emphatically do NOT say or acknowledge that you have been offered a voucher when seeking a charge back.
"To everyone contemplating going to your credit card company seeking a charge back DO NOT under any circumstances say or answer in the affirmative to a question ""have you been offered a voucher"". If you do the card company will say to you there is nothing they can do. Which is actually untrue as their own rules exclude them doing that. However finding an honest helpful assistance is going to be your main challenge.Everyone is looking out for the airline --no one is looking out for you."
Her is a new site in the U.K. where you can relate your issue with Ryanair and they are within the U.K. government.https:/…
"I got a MasterCard chargeback duly processed today despite the “offer” of a voucher. The fact that Ryan Air had in writing categorically confirmed that they would refund me was more than enough for the chargeback under mastercards current terms and conditions to be processed.. This was in the UK, different banks as well as different individuals within banks seem to be applying different rules and interpretations as they go along. Confusion abounds."
I just managed to submit details for a refund on their facebook page? not sure how this will pan out? Has anyone else had a go there?
"Update allmanaged to get through to a customer care agent just now in 10 minutes!this was their response to my request for a refund:Due to high volume of refund requests there is a possibility that our customers would not get their money back quickly enough, so Ryanair have decided to help our passengers out with the vouchers should they rebook their flights. On the other hand, transactions are not possible as of now due to security reasons, ie. payments are not possible to be made outside of the office. Hence we are offering our vouchers which are going to be valid at least until the actual refund procedures start. Unfortunately this can be at a later time due to government restrictions that our agents are not allowed to work in their offices so they cannot proceed with their normal refunding scenarios.Due to social distancing set up by the government, our refund teams must work from home, and because of this they have limited access to customers personal financial information. Once the government eases the social distancing guidelines, and the refund teams are back in office, refunds will be processed according to their normal timeline of 7-10 business days.I requested the refund for you. Once the refund agents will be able to work from the office, they will issue the refund and send you a refund confirmation email.So I'm under the impression i am now going to get a refund but who knows how long it will take! still not happy but it is an improvement on vouchers. Im still going to follow it up with my bank in the hopes i will get the refund quicker.good luck everyone!"
"I phoned the number below earlier today. chose option 6 and after 30 minutes wait, asked for refund instead of voucher. Supplied booking ref number and email address and was informed that I would get a refund into my bank in the future. No idea how long it would take, but I should receive an email informing me of the refund.03301007838"
"Just to update....I have today called Santander and registered a section 75 claim (section 75 applied for claims over £100).My advice: When you call be confident and knowledgeable (research before calling (eg section 75 Versus Chargeback).I called and simply said ""Hi, I would like to lodge a section 75 against Ryanair."". A section 75 is a legal right where a chargeback (under £100) is discretionary and the credit card company does not have to do a chargeback.They simply said, you you qualify as your purchase is between £100 and £30000, he gave me an email address to submit the claim with a list of items to include and warned it could take upto 8 weeks but is normally much quicker.My card: Santander Zero Mastercard Credit Card Good luck."
"Ryan Air are fobbing everybody off. Their verbal promise that you will get a refund in the future is worth nothing. EasyJet have been working under the same conditions and I eventually got 2 flights refunded after finally getting through to their call centre. Ryan Air are blatantly lying about their inability to refund, they are a bandit airline. The only way to deal with a bandit is the law, go to your credit card provider, where you have used one, and request they do a chargeback under section 75."
"It's important to know the difference between a section 75 and a chargeback claim as they are very different,A section 75 is for claims over £100 which some peoples tickets will not fall into (we were only just over for 2 tickets), the credit card company is held jointly responsible and therefore in their interest to get the money back.A chargeback is for claims under £100 and the credit card company does not have to do a chargeback, it's at their discretion as they are not jointly responsible, they can and often do not agree to do a chargeback.Edited: 12:38 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"Well - anyone outside of the UK filed a chargeback claim? We have no section 75, and not sure if what chargeback rules are in this case and how long it would actually take. Also because of lockdown, card companies here at least are also pretty much shut."
"@RainmanMumbaiYou would need to look up what your rights are in India, I know in Canada and USA they have similar laws to the UK, I would imagine your rights would not be very different."
"Just to clarify something - I am not in a great need for the refund money now yet I do not want a voucher and have not accepted the one offered in an email to me. I did apply for a refund previously and was told I would get one and I do have a screenshot of their acknowledgement.Is it right to say that in theory, if I do nothing, eventually (and yes, it may take weeks if not months) I will be refunded?"
"ZiggyUK is right you need to have spent a minimum of £100 to invoke the legally binding section 75. Regarding the chargeback ,I believe that you have only 120 days from your original purchase date in which to make a claim. This together with what Ziggy has said about banks often refusing to do chargebacks may put some people off trying. However speaking personally I had two payments of just under £100 refunded when lowcostholidays / hoteling.com went bust a while back even though I had paid for rooms over 10 months previously. I am not sure if in this case my bank actually combined the two payments into one under section 75 in order to still obtain a refund of money from a bankrupt company. Either way I got my money showing that some banks policy is not to upset their customers over such low ( for them at least) amounts."
"What about the 'force majeure' clause? Airlines and card companies could refuse refunds/ chargeback claims stating this clause. Travel agents here are saying this about airline and hotel refundsUnfortunately it's become a free for all and the rule book is out the windowEdited: 1:41 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"Same here, but I did manage to get another email off to them through the 'Complaint' system using 'Other'.I re-requested a refund and refused the vouchers, asking for a 'timely' refund within stated law, and mentioning that this 'issue' has been reported to the CAA and Trading Standards. Might not make a jot of difference but if we all band together and petition somehow, they may have to listen or risk a communal case in court! ?"
RainmanMumbaiIn the UK at least I believe they can use the ‘ force majeure’ clause to avoid paying any additional compensation but by law the original flight has to be refunded. The main thing I have found with the card issuer is that they are reluctant to reverse any payments unless you have any solid proof in writing that a refund was promised/confirmed. I tried to get my card provider to reverse payments with easyJet due to the fact that contacting easyJet had been impossible in over a month and I was getting generic replies back to all direct request for refunds. While they sympathised they said EasyJet had made known their intention to make refunds so I had to keep on trying to contact them. They did say they were not totally refusing to do a chargeback at any cost and to contact them again in a couple of weeks if I had no luck when maybe they could help. In that two weeks a miracle happened and I got through to easyjet and subsequently got my refunds.With Ryan Air things went very smoothly since I had all the evidence in writing that a refund had been offered and that offer had been subsequently rescinded by offering a useless voucher and asking me to apply again for the refund that they had already confirmed. One thing my bank kept mentioning without any mention of section 75 was that my claim more than met the banking terms & conditions of MasterCard so in regard to India I think you should fully investigate the small print of the actual credit card company you use in order to hopefully find something tangible that will enable you to put some pressure on your bank.The only thing I would add is that although I say I got my “refund” Ryan Airs could in theory challenge the charge back but given the strength of my case I think that is extremely unlikely.
glysen1962I did that to . Got automated “TID” number confirming they had received my complaint. All useful things to have in order to build up ones case.
"Just watched Martin Lewis on ITV. Ryanairs vouchers were mentioned, looks like he's on the case. Maybe watch for an update next week."
I have the exact situation as well. After many infuriating attempts to contact someone from Ryanair it’s clear I’ll get nowhere with them. I’m located in the US and I reached out to my credit card bank/issuer (Visa) and explained the situation. They opened a dispute claim and reversed the charge. Since I kept all the email correspondence they feel that I have a very strong case and most likely the charge reversal will be permanent.
"""I believe that you have only 120 days from your original purchase date in which to make a claim.""There's no deadline to file a section 75 claim as such although courts in the UK won't allow you to enforce the law after a certain number of years (6 years in England). For chargebacks, it's usually 120 days from when a problem arises (not the transaction date)."
"Hello, did the section 75 claim work ?"
# 383 - Who is Martin Lewis?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_(financial_journalist)
"Lexexpress,,Well that was a very selective “ cut and paste” of my post where I made no comment regarding section 75 cases specifically in regards to an individuals right to a claim.As regards “chargeback” I based my post on what I had read via the Martin Lewis website (hence my statement,”I believe”) which states the following :How long do you have to file a chargeback claim?The rules set by Visa, Mastercard and American Express only usually give you 120 days to get a claim in – and the clock usually starts ticking from the date of the payment, though it does depend on the type of situation..You use the word “usually” in a totally opposite context as in not the transaction date but the “totally open” date of when a problem arises. I accept that maybe flight refunds and these “unusual” times maybe is what Martin Lewis is referring to as a “special” situation.. Can you categorically confirm for the benefit of all of us that and hopefully from a professional capacity that this is actually the case?>Edited: 7:53 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"On their facebook page they have a link to ""a new way of connecting with us..."" or something like that. That link opens a chat window. You get asked if you have received a voucher, and then get asked if you still want a refund. If you click yes on those, you will need to type in some information. After a while (1 full day for me) I got connected to an agent that told me I am now in the queue and that my refund would be handled within the next few weeks. So try that if nothing else works!"
"@happytwotravel: I wasn't haven't a go at you, just clarifying the iinformation you provided for those that don't know."
"When this is all over won't the flights be a lot more expensive so they recoup their losses, so a voucher will only mean paying out more"
"Thanks for the update, yes the Facebook 'message' system allowed a chat. gave all info and got the message""Thanks for providing your booking information, an agent will now add you to the cash refund queue and will be in contact with you directly via email.""At least it's a step closer..."
i reapplied for my money back when i found t page t reapply i was told there was already an applection in n i could not re apply
Just tweet them - I asked for a refund on twitter and some agent said that I have been added to the refund queue - which is frankly all nonsense IMO. Whatever happened to the £4 billion reserves that they had? https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.c…
i cant claim my voucher because they put a different name on t 2 vouchers than is on t original booking ...on 1 voucher they put mrs ryan on t other they put cecile ryan this is deliberate so we cant claim t vouchers until this is over n prices will b way up as everyone will b traveling
"Hi there, same story today. i got en email with a strong advise to use voucher otherwise will wait until..nobody knows."
"Dear all, I have exactly the same problem as you. I know people who have asked for a refund in early March and they got their money back, and fairly soon! In my case, I received the e-mail canceling my flight by the end of March. I immediately submitted a refund request. I also received the same two e-mails as you and then the voucher, which I did not request. Now I cannot contact them, I would highly appreciate if you have any additional advice on how to proceed with this. Unfortunately, I paid with debit card so the credit card option will not work for me. Kind regards, Florencia"
"I had quite a few really surprising events with Ryan air they contacted me two weeks ago asking me did I want to change my flight free of charge to anywhere in June,July or August I went to have a look most prices were much cheaper than what we paid by a long shot. I then contacted customer service and asked could I have a voucher or book for October unfortunately they told me they could not do this I said I would wait for a refund. Technically they were trying to get people to change their flights to not have to refund people who paid higher fares very dodgy.Anyhow I then applied for a refund and received the voucher I have spent hours in chat and holding on phone with no resolve unfortunately until I saw this post about their Facebook page thank goodness I did it this way and I have received a reply they received and voucher is available until I receive my refund I have also complained emailed etc will call credit card company later on.I would not normally fly RyanAir only the destination I needed to get to. I will not be using them again in future after the stunt they attempted to pull."
"Hi, the same here... weeks awaiting for their reply and now they sent the coupon. On the link where we can request the refund, there is nothing to claim and online chatting is useless as none is responding. I am trying on twitter..."
I even lost reservations from history!
I to have had the same email. I'm NOT clicking on the link for the vochers. It's a waiting game now I want a refund. We all no flight are going to go through the roof. I want to rebook the same destination for the same price or I want a refund. I've been advised to hang on because what they are doing is illegal.
"""I want to rebook the same destination for the same price""You can. Either online (if your cancelled flight is not in the past) or by calling Ryanair."
"Had exactly the same issue. Got a second email saying I should consider the voucher when I told them I wanted a full refund.I went through the email and right at the bottom it said click here for refund and I did. It then took me to some bot a computer that intelligently trys to answer you. Yeap, I went through the utter crap of questions until I saw something that said speak to a agent. One my first attempt the agent disconnected me dibrately citing that I did not respond with 2 minutes, which was total bollocks. My second attempt I finally got through using the chat facility and managed to speak to someone who said they are happy to give a full refund... But wait... Then he tells me I can't do the refund now as we are all working from home and because of data security and GDPR we cannot process your refund. He goes on to say when the Coronavirus abates they will process the refund. So that was a complete waste of time. I screenshot all the chat and have made a formal complaint to ABTA. Michael oLeary won't win trust me. I will also sue them in court and also ask for interest on they money they've had for 6 months. Get your complaints into ABTA"
"We are in same position, I’ve raised via message with them on twitter and got this response finally: To add you to the refund queue, we’d like the following: - Type “Booking Reference” and include 6 digit reference code- Full name of the passengers- Route, date and time- The email entered in the booking- last 4 digits of the credit card which was used to pay for the booking Please note that as our payment agents are required to work from home in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, payment security restrictions prevent us from processing cash refunds as quickly as we would like to. Your voucher will be valid until the refund is paid.Is this the experience of others? Didn’t really want to include credit card digitsThanks"
"Well that's new, they only asked me PNR + email. I think whatever everyone tries, it's not going to work. Ryan Air is openly doing this without any fear of law whatsoever. They obviously have some sort of backingEdited: 3:20 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Update from me. Took the advice from someone who published it earlier in this thread. I contacted my credit card company yesterday (customer service). I explained my situation with Ryanair and they already knew about it since more customers had contacted them about the same issue. They told me to do a regular claim and so I did. I told the whole story and attached all e-mails I got from Ryanair. I also was smart enough to keep the screenshot from the first form I filled in where it says “original form of payment should show in your account within 5-7 days”. Indicating their first intention was to give back the money in “cash” and not vouchers. I have contacted Ryanair both via the chat agent function (waited for many hours) and sent in a complaint via a form, took the screen shots and attached them too. Today I got a message from the credit card company and they had approved my claim! How ever they reserve their rights to withdraw the claim/charge if any new information appear (what on earth that would be). Ryanair changing there strategy and pumping out the refunds in cash all of a sudden? Not likely if you ask me. After I got the message from the credit card company of course I checked my account and the whole amount for my flight was put back. I encourage you people out there in the same situation to do the same. I hope my “story” give some hope to get your money back.Edited: 3:38 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"""How ever they reserve their rights to withdraw the claim/charge if any new information appear (what on earth that would be)""All credit companies give the company a chance to essentially ""defend itself"". So that disclaimer is there to alert you to that. Should they manage to come up with an adequate defence (and I agree with you right now that is unlikely) then they will reverse the refund to you. This prevents people maliciously using the chargeback.So, standard form disclaimer stuff. I wouldn't be concerned."
"""Get your complaints into ABTA""What does ABTA have to do with anything? Ryanair is not a travel agency (nor are they British)."

"I just submitted my refund request again via Facebook messanger, it was quick and very straightforward. Their messenger guided you through what info was needed. It then confirmed I had been added to the refund request queue and to await my refund."
"Exactly same thing happened to me. Told my refund was being processed then got the email option for a voucher. Have not accepted and have tried emailing them to decline but surprise surprise no response. Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert has lodge a formal complaint about this with the Aviation Authorities so hopefully that will help our cause. Thanks for the tip, I'll try my credit card provider"
"I have also been sent an email offering a voucher, with a link to claim a refund. The link only allows you to claim the voucher. I'm already in a queue for a refund so have ignored the email.We should all never forget this, and one thing we can do is..... Never again book a flight with Rynair!"
"Unfortunately, I paid with my debit card as I would not pay the extra ££ to use my credit card, first time I have ever done this, so cannot claim from my bank.I too am not pressing that magic button for a voucher, or indeed any link. I was offered a full refund and same as many many others its now changed to a voucher. I hope this complaint from Martin Lewis is taken seriously and something is done."
"See my post # 406 here - Ryan Air is openly cheating customers, and they really care 2 hoots about it. It's absolutely no fear of law whatsoever"
"So I have been going through the exact same thing. What I've done is that, first, don't accept the vouchers if you don't want to. I was waiting in line in their chat and got connected to an agent in less than an hour which is not as bad as I have expected. In my first message, I made it very clear that I want a full refund, not a voucher, provided them with all the booking references and the billing address to the booking. This is to avoid missing their response when you are away from the screen and if you didn't provide everything in the original and they had to ask you for more info and if you dont respond within 2 mins then you out of the chat. Anyway, the agent then said he has placed my request for cash refund for all the bookings once they are processed I will get an email to confirm it. When I asked, ""Does it mean I will get a full refund?"" He did confirm that I will get a full refund although he did say he cannot give me a time and the reason is ""Due to social distancing set up by the government, our refund teams must work from home, and because of this they have limited access to customers personal financial information. Once the government eases the social distancing guidelines, and the refund teams are back in office, refunds will be processed according to their normal timeline of 7-10 business days."" I've also requested a transcript of that conversation which I then received within 10 mins after the chat ended. I have not received a confirmation about the refund yet but we will see. I have also simultaneously sent a complaint/ refund request to customerqueries@ryanair.com and requested a chargeback with my bank, even though I booked it on a debit card. Never not try..."
"@EnglandsscoutEven though you paid by debit card you can still ask for a chargeback, you don't have the powerful section 75 cover that credit card purchases over £100 have, but you have the exact same cover credit card purchases of under £100 have...... The card issuer will consider your claim and may decide to help under part of the voluntary chargeback scheme.In some cases card issuers using the voluntary scheme may ask you to send them a ""final notice before action"" giving them 14 days to pay up."
What number do I call to do that? And is it free?
@IsabellWho are you replying too? What number do you want?
"Ziggyuk, i have now spoken to my bank, and because Ryanair have still said they will refund, but not when, they will not chargeback on my debit card.So its a waiting game with them"

"latest update (27th April)After two failed attempts, when I started a chat in the morning, and never got a reply until they shut down the chat at night, I got through to somebody today (logged into my ryanair account, clicked on useless options, etc. got to that little blue-bubble chat-opener. I got through to somebody quickly (within 10 min), requested a refund, they didn't try to push me to accept the voucher, said I should get, within 24-48 hr, an email from ryanair with, wait for this, confirmation that I don't want a voucher (has ANYONE got such an e-mail from ryanair?). When I pressed on the follow-up, they confirmed that they're still NOT issuing refunds (this information is, possibly, right, possibly wrong), and wait til the government eases restrictions (presumably so ryanair staff can go back to the office to process all the (hundreds of thousands, presumably) requests.So, in short, there's nothing else one can do for now, only chase ryanair for refund when the lockdown is off, and keep chasing, because ryanair will play for time as long as possible. The longer they keep the money, the longer it generates a handsome interest, and if they don't fly, this is the only money they're making for now.And, to all those who haven't spoken / chatted with ryanair staff yet - please, please, don't take it out on them. It's not their fault their employer behaves disgracefully, yet they get all the (...) for ryanair. They're on the same boat as customers, bottom of the food chain, and they'll be the first to be ""let go"" by Mr O'Leary."
"""The longer they keep the money, the longer it generates a handsome interest,""Incorrect.That's not how businesses run.""and if they don't fly, this is the only money they're making for now.""THAT is the key to this - they have no income but a LOT of costs - they have staff to pay, they have contractual obligations for offices and slots at airports to pay.. they are NOT sitting on wads of cash profiting from not refunding stuff - quite the contrary - they are out looking for loans in order to try to pay - most have run out of ready cash a while go and are in a struggle for the life of the business. They MAY get some sort of government bailout, and that will probably have to go to refunds but right now? I wouldn't be holding my breath."
I am the same as many others told I would be refunded but sent a voucher which is to suit Ryanair by only being good for 1 year A solicitor is the next move it looks like
The only people that are going to win from this are going to be the lawyers/solicitors.
I suspect that you are in the employ of Ryanair because you are conveniently omitting certain facts. Ryeanair is the 3rd wealthiest airline in the world. Ryanair is sitting on reserves of over 1.5 Billion dollars. Ryanair like all other large employers in the U.K. is eligible to apply for the 80% coverage of employees wages (even if the employee isn't working).Finally this is not money Ryanair is entitled to. It offered a service (product) it took money for the service it did not provide the service. To keep the money is either fraud or theft.
"I was probably one of the lucky few who got a cash refund from Ryanair.I do have 3-6 flights each month with them and am on the hook for about 25-30 more flights, but got refunded for two flights (31 March- 2 April and 7 April-18 April).After those, a couple of flights where I could fill the refund form but then shortly got the fraudulent voucher email."
"Ryan Air executives came up with the largest scam to steal people's money. They should go bankrupt and go to hell. Nasty business practice, the executives should go to jail."
"Please, there's no need to sugarcoat what you really think."
"I contacted customer services last week advising them I did not want to accept the voucher. I received a reply today stating that the voucher is valid for 12 months, if you do not use the voucher before the expiry date (April 2021) you will receive a full cash refund, if you spend part of the voucher you can claim the rest back in either cash or a further voucher.then there is a link below to click on to accept the voucher. still nothing about being able to claim refund now..."
I declined the voucher by phone again last week he told me id be getting a refund now today I’ve received yet another voucher saying if I don’t use within 12 months I’ll then get a cash refund. This is an absolute joke!
"OK, now they say I'll get a refund in April 2021 if the voucher isn't used. Appreciate that.Though I think they should have mentioned that earlier when they sent their damn voucher offer without an option to reject it. That would definitely save a lot of time for me filling complains and for my bank trying to revoke the transaction.But their email is again kind of ambiguous to me, I'm still not sure whether should I click ""accept the voucher"" or not in order to get a refund later. Or should I just ignore the email? RyanAir at its best.So I will be thankful to whoever received the same email and understands English (or Law science maybe?) better than me to give a good advice. Thank you in advance!"
Latest on MSE. https:/…
I’m ignoring the email & im gonna be calling up Ryan air tomorrow I’ll post what they say!
"Natalie, are you in the UK? If so did you read the info in the link in post 437?"
Just read it but unsure of what it means. I refused voucher 5 weeks ago then received one last week I called up and requested a refund he said he was processing then today receive that email? I’m so confused to be honest. I paid by debit card so I’m not able to get charge back am I? Thanks
According to all the sources i have read re airline cancelled flights. Two things are very clear If you request a refund over anything else the airline may offer you are entitled to a full refund in the manner in which you made the payment.#2 if a refund is requested they must provide it within 7 days of the request. To the best of my knowledge CTA/CAA/and APPR regulations. They ALL say the same. Now just try to get the airline or the regulatory applicable authority anywhere to enforce that. Good luck.
"Today I have receveid the same mail, I don't still confermed the voucher.I think if they have sent this mail message different from the first, because they know not to be honest"
"Ryanair what a absolute con. Applied for a refund 4 weeks later sent a voucher. Spent a hour on hold to dispute it and said I didn't want it. They said they flagged up that I have now refused the voucher and I will be in line for a cash refund. They have now sent an email saying this.... I'm going home today to get the credit card paperwork to disputeEmail below: Ryanair Group Customer Care (Ryanair DAC, Lauda & Malta Air)Dear Customer,You have recently received an email with a voucher code to the value of your original booking.Please note that this voucher is valid for 12 Months and can be used for your future travel plans, please note that if you do not use the voucher the voucher before the expiry date you will receive a full cash refund, in the event you use the voucher in part you will also receive the option of a voucher for the balance or a cash refund after the expire date.Please click on the link below to accept the voucher"

"Following up from my post yesterday, have a look at what Martin Lewis is sayingOn: https:/…Edited: 3:00 am, April 29, 2020 "
"If you read the full article it tells you how, when you've paid by debit card, to ask for a "" chargeback"" . It also states that bank customers are being successful."
"446. Was in answer to Natalie.Here is the relevant section.........To make a claim, you'll need to contact your bank and explain the situation. How the issue is dealt with will vary from bank to bank – it may provide you with a form to fill in or ask for evidence of your purchase.There's no guarantee of success doing this – in fact, a number of Ryanair customers who have approached their bank say their chargeback request was turned down because Ryanair has already provided a voucher. (In that case, you can raise a complaint with the card firm and escalate to the Financial Ombudsman if necessary.)But we are hearing success stories from those who have tried this. For example, MoneySaver Kim told us she was able to get £896 back from Barclays for several Ryanair tickets she had booked between Manchester and Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. She said: ""The adviser asked a couple of questions and checked with supervisors. She said the money would be in the account within 24 to 48 hours. In fact it was refunded within the hour.""And Alan said on Facebook: ""Prompted by MSE raising this a few days ago, I went online to my credit card Amex, and raised a claim against the charge for services not provided. Three days later Amex wrote to me to say my account had been credited with the flight amount.""It's worth being aware that even after you've got money back via chargeback, the cash can still technically be clawed back if the firm you bought from successfully disputes your claim within a limited period (usually within 45 days of your bank approaching the firm). See our Chargeback guide for more info.Edited: 5:01 am, April 29, 2020 "
"Yesterday I finally connected with the chat service. Told them I wanted a refund and not a voucher they had sent me. They said fine. Today they emailed me to tell me I'm in the queue for a refund. I can still use the voucher if I want but eventually they'll send me a refund.I'd rather have the money yesterday but I can manage with the current situation. The voucher is useless for me. The flights I might take aren't even showing on the schedule right now. Who knows what flights will be flying come April when the voucher would expire.Edited: 6:03 am, April 29, 2020 "
"Just got off the phone, he said anyone that’s requested a refund and it’s being processed not to worry about the email we received as it’s one they’ve sent all the customers. He looked at my reservation & said the refund has been approved & the very longest I will wait for a refund is 3 months."
How long did it take to get your voucher?
To get the voucher first you ask for the refund. Then for me I guess two weeks for the voucher. Maybe a day or two less.
"Just to update....I submitted a section 75 late on Thursday 23/4 told it could take upto 8 week.Monday 27/4 they confirmed my request and requested the receipt.Today 29/04 they confirmed they have initially submit a charge back and it that failed they would go full section 75.This is good as it is inline with Martin Lewis's latest advice.Edited: 11:52 am, April 29, 2020 "
Sounding good Ziggyuk.
"On 20/03/2020 Ryanair said the flight was cancelled and I could claim a full refund. They said ""Refunds will be processed within 7 working days back to the form of payment used for the original booking."" On 24/03/2020 I claimed this refund. On 20/04/2020 (28 days after the flight was cancelled) Ryanair emailed me offering a credit voucher not a refund. They have not honoured their promise of a refund in 7 working days. I emailed Ryanair on 21/04/2020 rejecting their ""voucher"" and stated I want my refund in cash back to my credit card. They have not replied since. Under Section 75 NatWest should charge back my payment of 16/20/2020 and take up the matter with Ryanair themselves. Everyone should complain via post #9 link and put pressure on Ryanair to process refunds - it only takes 2 minutes."
"Good advice that, follow the link on post #9 and register a complaint. I also made a complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority on caa dot co dot uk. I just about fetched up my breakfast listening to O’Leary’s smug defence of Ryanair on BBC this morning. Anyway, here is the complaint I registered…Ryanair cancelled my flights leaving me in stranded in Spain. A few days before, they offered me option to CHANGE flights (not refund) and only officially cancelled the flight at the last minute so that I might be feel forced in the days before the flight to change the booking, thus evading their obligation to refund me. My contention is that they knew well in advance that the flight would be cancelled yet they deliberately waited until the last minute before informing passengers so that the passenger them self might instigate a cancellation. This tactic left hundreds of thousands of Brits stranded. I did not cancel. So Ryanair of course CANCELLED the flight LAST MINUTE.Complete disregard for their customers, their actions are clearly only about preserving their bottom line.Now, having requested a full refund and been very understanding when they said this would take longer than normal to process, I have received by automatic email fully one month later VOUCHERS. I spent days trying to contact them for a refund in the first place and I clearly asked for a FULL REFUND and was assured in subsequent messages from Ryanair that it was being processed, please be patient. I was.But now with this email message they have shifted the onus back on me to pursue them if I don't want to accept the vouchers! More time wasted because as everyone knows it is IMPOSSIBLE to contact Ryanair unless you are prepared to spend DAYS on the phone trying to get through to their (deliberately) inadequately staffed telephone operator. No problem getting through to book a flight though funnily enough.This is CLEARLY designed to discourage customers pursuing the refund that Ryanair KNOW they are entitled to. Most people will simply value their time too highly and leave Ryanair with the money. But at a time when everyone is struggling this behaviour is disgusting.Now O’Leary has just been on BBC breakfast time telling us that everyone who doesn’t want to accept the vouchers will get a refund. BUT they will have to get in touch to tell us (AGAIN) that they want a refund. And when pressed on when the refunds would be processed he was of course completely evasive and non-committal! He says they are processing 4 times as many refunds as normal. WHY only 4 times? He has furloughed his staff for us tax-payers to pick up the tab. Why not put more on processing refunds, Michael? Not good enough."
"Jim, per your review, you live in Spain, so why not take the voucher, you will go back one day, and I expect the flight is not that expensive."
Why would anybody take a voucher? They keep pushing back the date of flights every month. Nobody knows when flights will resume. If they'll be flying from your local airport to somewhere you want to go. It's nice to say take the voucher but most of us paid right away. The idea that we should just be happy with a voucher is so wrong .
"I also heard Michael O'Leary this morning, this time on Today on Radio 4. He repeated the statement that anyone who wants a refund will get one, but for most it won't be any time soon.To put the situation into context he said that under normal conditions RyanAir issues about 10,000 refunds a month. For March, April and May they are dealing with 25 MILLION refunds. On top of that the office staff they have dealing with the requests is at 25% of normal because of staff off sick, self-isolating etc.He said that he expected the March refunds to be all dealt with in one or two months. If you're looking for a refund for an April or May flight it will clearly be a lot longer than that."
Somebody want to explain why Ryanair can't automate the refund ? The excuse that staff is limited is an excuse. They don't need staff to handle the refunds anymore than they need staff to take online bookings.
"nobody wants to explain why Ryanair can't automate their refund process, because it's (...) obvious to everybody (Ryanair first of all) what this game is about - they CAN automate it, but they DON'T HAVE TO, and they WON'T. There's no benefit to them to return BILLIONS of pounds / euros sooner, when it sits on their bank accounts and brings the profit every day. If they really have 25 mln refunds to process, take this number and multiply by, say, 20 quid per ticket/refund (I know, people paid HUNDREDS sometimes, but I'm being generous. Anyway, that already makes 500 mln gbp on their banks accounts (in reality it's probably well over 1 billion). Guess how much interest that gets? So, I'm not surprised this ""gentleman"" will drag his feet for as long as he can (and then some) before he returns this money. And we shouldn't make a mistake that the UK, or any other government will put A LOT of pressure on Ryanair. The governments HAVE TO play nice with Ryanair, because they need Ryanair to kickstart economy, when people want to travel again, and spend money on junk purchased in airport ""parlours"", and don't forget that most money in your price ticket does not go to the airline, but goes back to state coffers (just look at the detailed price breakdown). So, Ryanair will drag their feet to put people off getting their money back, and the governments will make a show of wagging a finger at them, but no real pressure. And, it will work, i.e. when people want to fly again, and they still haven't got their refunds, quite a lot of them will click on the (no doubt very, very large) button on booking page: ""YES! PLEASE! Offset the price of flight I'm booking against the total value of my [unwanted] voucher!"". Scummy way of running a business, but we've all agreed to participate when we booked that first Ryanair flight. And kept booking."
I saw something somewhere in news this morning that Ryanair said people who want refunds may have to wait 6 months..
The real point here is WHY are there so many (millions) more than normally refund requests. I will tell you WHY. They created fictitious flights in a crisis period to suck people into booking (paying) then they cancelled the flights and kept the money. In the future the system should be reversed whereby if an airline cancels a flight the onus is on them to immediately contact the customer to set up a refund or voucher. The option should always be with the client not the merchant. That would fix this. If they don't want to be required to contact the client they must automatically refund the payment in the manner it was made.
I got the same email if i accept voucher and not use it for 12 months i will get money anyway. I dont see point of argue with them and all this hassle for few pounds. Most people will use them i next 12 months for sure.
"I'm in the same situation. Not able to reach them yet.I was just wondering, is there anyone here that DID accept the voucher?If so, how did it work? Did you receive the voucher immediately with some sort of code to use in future booking?Asking because it's supposed to be a fully automated process.Thanks!"
When you receive your flight cancellation notification. You fill the form for a money refund......You will receive a voucher code by email.
Saw a thing on bbc news today. They said Ryanair May take up to 6 months to get a refund. They also said a lot of airlines will go bust but Ryanair should be okay
if you do not use the voucher before the expiry date you will receive a full cash refund so i do not know why its a problem for some people.Other options is wait for money up to 6 months
"Cannot understand why people queue up to give the bandit their money,when you can leave Dublin Port at 8am and be in Central London at 4pm on Sail/Rail.No arriving at airport 2hrs before departure,no extra to priority board or pick a seat and take as much luggage as you can carry.Suits me better than one of Mr.O'Leary's cattle trucks."
"If that was the only route they did, then fair enough. But it does tend to take somewhat longer and for many multiple times the cost when going by, say, rail, to get from most starting points to a destination. That one reason why I fly with them. Ok, some enjoy the train journey, no problem with that, but 24 hours instead of four or five including getting to the airport and waiting time? And fifty euro instead of two or three hundred probably.There's always a risk with Ryanair that you'll end up with the crap end of the stick, but play by the rules, know the rules, and in normal times, I'll put up with it to get across Europe quickly and cheaply.Edited: 5:57 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"Just came off the phone with Ryanair on the number 033010078386. I got through almost immediately and spoke to Petra who was very helpful. She confirmed that my preference of 'rejecting the voucher' and said that once the office is operational again following government's advice, it will take 7-10 working days for the refund to be processed.This was music of course to my ears (from what many before have said), so in light of this I gave them a top rating for this particular experience. From start to finish including getting through and providing feedback at the end in under 10 minutes. Amazing. Let's see if they can fulfill that promise of 7-10 days from the time their office is operational and when that would be."
"471. Slightly different to what they were saying on their Facebook page yesterday!https://m.facebook.com/story.php…Edited: 2:09 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"What happens to those who file a Section 75 (?) chargeback claim with their Credit card/ Bank? Money is credited to you, but if Ryan Air says they are issuing vouchers, then will the Bank take that credit back from you??"
We don't know yet. As I mentioned to you before it will take several weeks before cases have completed.
"You have to remember there is a big difference between a chargeback and a section 75.With a section 75 you are not claiming from your bank, you are holding the card issuer (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) jointly responsible with the airline for the loss. As they are being held responsible, it is in their interest to recoup the money from the airline or they could end up holding the baby and footing the bill.Also as there are only the three main card issuers, they will soon have a policy in place for these section 75 claims (and chargebacks for that matter) as they will need to deal with them consistently.I personally feel they have not got a leg to stand on as they are in breach of EU law, they have asked for a change to the law and this has not happened which indicates a change of law is not considered necessary.When they tell us they don't have the staff to process the claims, tell my why they created a situation that means all customers who want to reject the voucher have to phone in, do the staff have that amount of free time on their hands?BA are the same, you can request a voucher or even rebook a flight online, but want a refund and you have to call them........... again, too much free time on their hands, free time they would be better using that time to process the refunds.Edited: 6:24 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"As with others I declined the voucher. Then received another email to request a refund again. Clicked on the link, had a error message and to click on another link which took me to a ryanair unrelated page. Any advice."
"Request for a refund on the Twitter page, they will put you in their refund queue, if any such thing exists i.e"
"I've just received a temporary credit by my credit card issuing Bank for my Ryan Air flights. They now want to see evidence that the Airline has promised to refund. I've forwarded them all possible emails to and from Ryan. Let's see if that is acceptable.Meanwhile, the credit lies in my account but I won't be using it till the Bank re-confirms"
"""Any advice.""You need to contact their customer services (on chat or by phone) to request a refund."
Managed to get money back through Starling bank MasterCard by chargeback for flights to Poland back at the end of March. Just sent them documents requesting refund emails recd saying we need more time. Then eventually getting a voucher and an email from me saying I wanted a refund not a voucher and the next reply was another voucher. Then an email once again saying didn’t want a voucher wanted a refund. No response. Contacted Starling sent paperwork Wednesday money refunded back today dated October the date I booked the flight. So if you use starling bank I would certainly give it a go
"Just received a voucher instead of a refund as well, due to fly tomorrow!!!I too am going to email them my refund request again just as proof I do not want this voucher!!!"

"I have applied for a refund and sent a few emails. Been offered a voucher, if we break the law we get done! Ryanair are breaking the law know ones bothered!!"
I declined the voucher as I applied for a refund 2 months ago. Still no progress from them. No point calling them as their customer service is abysmal. Have asked my CC company to get my payment back under Section 75. Also I advise everybody to see the http link on post #9 and complain to the CMA. Only takes 2 minutes to complete the complaint form.
"Asked for refund in March was then promised a refund then got the runaround with the voucher email.I didn't click the link and sent them a message not accepting the voucher and was told that they couldn't give me a time frame for a refund.So initiated a chargeback with the bank and just had an email saying the money has been credited back to my account provisionally.So will have to wait and see what Ryanair have to say about this if they try to query it.Why why will they not just pay the refund in a timely manner, rather than customers having to start hassling there bank for there money back ?"
"Hi to everyone!I've requested a refund, they offered me a voucher and in the email they say:""f you do not wish to accept this voucher option and wish to move your flight or request a refund, please click here to contact us.""After clicking the link, there's a page saying HOW TO USE THE VOUCHER and no links to request again the refund. Everything has been done to avoid refund requests.This is a SCAM. Totally insane.Please let me know how you do it.Thanks!"
"Use this link https://prod-chatbot.ryanair.com/index.htmType in a single word such as refund and when the bot asks if the question was answered, click noDuring Ryanair working hours you will then be able to click on I Need To Speak With SupportFill out the form and wait to be connected to a human. They will push the voucher but if you ask to be added to the refund queue they will - they then send a email confirming you have rejected the voucher and want cashI did this for three separate flights and the maximum wait time was 10 minutes - but maybe I was lucky"
487.But have you received your refund?
"Not yet but as I was only placed on the refund queue for the first flight two weeks ago, I am not surprised. I'll see what the situation is in a month or so from now.My message was primarily to assist 486 who is at the previous stage of the process."
"Same run round as the rest of you. Used process detailed at 487, been promised that I am added to refund Q and should be confirmed in 24 hours, though actual refund may take?????????????. I await next contact from Ryan Air, Breath not being held."
@Denmark1970 ryanairen@ryanair.com is NOT a monitored e-mail address; it's customerqueries@ryanair.com
"Same problem. New angle on the voucher scam. They say if you still want a refund contact us. When I go there it asks me to put in my booking reference when I do they say in effect no such booking exists, despite the fact it's on all the stuff they send me."
493. Have you tried inputting the lead name in capitals?
"I applied for a refund two months ago, and made a claim back request a month ago. Heard nothing about either. Think banks must be inundated too?Anyway, just been on the Ryanair live chat. Got the usual response, ""Staff are working from home and can't process refunds."" So I asked which country the refunds department is based in as the lockdown is being lifted in some nations. ""We're sorry Sir, but I cannot share that sensitive information."" So prepare yourselves, what's the betting O'Leary claims the refund department is based in the country that lifts lockdown last in the world."
"According to Google, some based at Head Office in Dublin including the Customer Service Manager, with out posts in Hungary and Romania."
"Methinks he will put the company into receivership before he pays out any refunds.I have been waiting since 06/04 and I have friends who are waiting since mid march.I have now basically accepted that my money is written off and I will be looking for alternative options to get from Ireland to the UK,of which there are many."

"I have the same story, but different airline. Qatar Airlines gave me a voucher when specifically asked for a monetary refund. I know they have a lot going on, but this bait and switch is infuriating!"
"It does appear there is a hug inconsistency in RyanAir's approach to refund handling. Our three trips were cancelled, we asked for a refund for the 1st one on 16.05.2020. I can confirm we have not received email confirmation but made sure to save the print out from their website with details. The ""thank you"" page at the end of refund request simply stated ""once approved refund will be with you in 20 days"". I have been checking CreditCard, spam and trash mail since 16.05.2020. Nothing (no emails, vouchers or acknowledgements). Today (25.05.2020) I checked our RyanAir account the flight disappeared from our account (not mentioned in past trips)... no refund, no email, no flight... ? Seems to me the case for Section 75... other two flights are still there, made further screenshot for as what I understand will be future dispute."
"What's the inconsistency? You'll almost cerainly be getting a voucher shortly, just like everybody else."
I have two cancelled Ryanair flights. They sent the voucher emails to which I did not respond.One refund request is now 2 months old so I went on their ‘Chat’ line & was told about the voucher but I said that I had not clicked on the link within the voucher email and that I wanted a cash voucher. Service agent then said that he would put my request for a cash voucher in the refund queue. Now received an email confirming the above. I also did the same thing for the second flight cancellation request which is just 3 weeks old.So it looks like the best route is to go in to Ryanair’s chat line to request your cash refund again otherwise your initial request might stay in limbo.
"""So it looks like the best route is to go in to Ryanair’s chat line to request your cash refund again otherwise your initial request might stay in limbo.""That is correct and they tell you in the voucher email that if you still wish to claim a refund you need to contact them again."
"Here my latest episode from this Nightmare in Ryanair Series:I actually have around 7 or 8 flights all cancelled.Step 1: they sent me the email with the announcement of the cancellationStep 2: I requested the refund back to the original method of paymentStep 3: 1 month later in each of the bookings, they sent the email offering a voucher instead of refund, just like everyone else.Step 4: I try 300 ways of contacting Ryanair, but only successful with a telephone call to their Spanish Customer Care line and they sent me a link to reject the voucher and request (again) the refundStep 5: they confirmed right away that I've been on the queue waiting for refund.Step 6: just yesterday, the sent me all the emails at once (mmmm) referring to all the bookings cancelled and all of these new emails say something like ""be patient, money is coming""Well, having received all the emails at once, with bookings from March, April and May (June still waiting), makes me think they didn´t do anything and some machine sent emails to everyone yesterday.Right now, I´m not expecting any more plot turns, but the money back."
"""Right now, I´m not expecting any more plot turns, but the money back.""Refunds are not being processed until the COVID crisis has passed. That's what they tell you on their website."
"Yes of course #506, I know the refund is not gonna come tomorrow, or in a month time, what I mean is that after all this, the next step from them is to send the money, don´t know when though."
"After getting the run around from Ryanair for a flight that was cancelled back in March, on 21 May I raised a 'non-delivery of service' case with the credit card provider (Amex )that I used to make the bookings seeking a refund. Full amount appeared in my Amex account yesterday!"

"Please be aware that any vouchers received can only be used by the lead passenger to make another booking. I've just tried to book an additional seat on a flight I already have booked but find I cannot as the name is different.I also feel the Ryanair website is very misleading in this respect as it says vouchers can be used to book seats for other people but does not make it clear the lead passenger must be the same. I felt I was 'playing the game' by accepting the voucher as I understand they must have cash flow issues but now feel rather betrayed. I have tried pursuing a charge back from my credit card company for my other outstanding cancellations. I'm not sure I have any great faith in that though!Edited: 6:34 am, May 26, 2020 "
#508 - can you raised Chargeback or used Section 75? Thank you
"Another disappointed customer of Ryanair I am ofer from Israel I was supposed to have a flight from Tel Aviv to Sofia and returned to Tel Aviv on the first of April4 people After thay canceling the flight I asked for a refund To this day, only receives an e mail from them that the issue was addressed and received a refund which of course did not arriveThere is no one to talk toIn my opinion, we should organize a group and sue them in court, including extras and other expensesNo doubt their flight services should not be used anymore."
"Hi everyone, just to let people know that I have had my money back (Nearly 300) from a chargeback request for my Ryanair flights, from my bank.I filled it in about 5 weeks ago, so if you did that too, be patient. I did chase the bank up two weeks ago though. I’m so glad I bought the tickets with a credit card in the first place."
"I would like to update my post #505 if permitted.I am receiving new emails offering me the possibility to still use the voucher but with new terms: now I can change my flight without paying penalty fees and this is new, with no fare difference payment.Hey Ryanair, I book with you very often, If you would have offered this much earlier, I definitely would have taken it, but now, after all this scam feeling, sorry but I'm sticking to the idea of getting a refund and fly to London with easyJet instead."
Has any one actually received a cash refund. The owner states that 40% of cash refunds have been made but I've been waiting since march for mine and nothing
I've tried the chat line and they never connect me to an agent
gave up trying to get through by all of the methods available... decided to submit a Section 75 claim to Barclaycard which I was able to do online...it has taken 5 weeks instead of the normal 3 for a decision but that's understandable in the circumstances... glad to say that i received a letter last week confirming that they have refunded the full amount to my credit card so a great result for me in terms of getting my money back..so dont delay get a claim in now as it can be done at the same time even although Ryanair have offered a voucher and the refund situation is still ongoing ... you just can accept refund from both of course... good luck folks
sorry should have said that CANNOTaccept refund from both as I'm sure everyone knows
** Just an update**We did a section 75 against our credit card company back in May for our April flights. Today we received a refund from the bank.
I’ve just recieved an email telling me refund has been processed and I will get money bank into bank within 5-7 days! Finally!
I accepted the Voucher and did not even get it!!!!!!!!!!!! how does it take to get the email with Voucher number?
So anyone actually got a refund yet?
"Received an e-mail from Ryanair yesterday, informing me that my refund had been processed and should be in my bank within 5-7 days.That was for a flight to Krakow that was due to go out on the 5th of April. I phoned Ryanair a few days after the 5th of April, was on hold for 30 minutes, but left my details and was told I was on the refund list, but it would take a while to get the money back."
"I also received an email telling me my refund for my March flight was being processed. A couple of days later it appeared on my credit card.I had already been credited by the card company as I had disputed the payment. I had to ring the card company up and ask them to deduct the credit I had already received from the refund I received today. I had previously jumped through all the hoops everyone else here had jumped through.Edited: 6:14 am, June 12, 2020 "
Received refund back to credit card yesterday.Just waiting for Jet2 to refund my cancelled flights to Rome now...…………………...
I am in my 13th week of awaiting a refund from Ryanair and sympathise with all those having problems. I will never use their services again even taking into account their somewhat lower prices. Back to Jet2. It is shameful the way that they are treating their customers and is somewhat jocular that they are trying to take the Government to task over quarantining saying it is illegal!!
"Got my Ryanair refund today, a little over 2 months after I was due to travel,which I think is pretty good given the difficult times we are all living in. My son received a refund in a similar time frame for his trip too.I will definitely continue to use Ryanair in the future as they have provided me with some great value flights over the last 20 years. I know they're not perfect but if like me you're happy to travel with just hand baggage & are not bothered if you sit next to your partner they provide excellent value.Jet2 holidays provided me with a refund within 14 days, so well done to them too. Exoticca travel however are dragging their feet but I'm still hopeful.Good luck to everyone waiting for refunds."
Thanks for telling everybody how you got on guys - Allen H seems to be having a longer wait than everybody else so I suggest he chases them up 13 weeks is a long time :-(
Also now 13 weeks since flights were cancelled and 12 weeks from when we were meant to fly.
This morning I recieved an email from Ryanair thanking me for my patience (I haven't had much choice really) as they are working their way through an unprececented backlog of refunds.This is for cancelled flights on 1st and 4th May that I then recieved vouchers for despite requesting a refund and then having to go through their online chat to re-request my refund so looks like I've got a bit longer to wait yet!
I got the same email. It's the 3rd I've received in as many months.
Received 2 emails today acknowledging that I've asked for a refund.
Just received refund from credit card .... took a while but better than waiting for Ryanair. Have another 2 sets of flights that I’ll have to start process again.
533. Wow... Great news!
"Jet 2 have contacted me and informed me that the refund for cancelled flights to and from Rome on 7th July, should be in my bank within the next 28 days."
I received a refund from Ryanair for a cancelled April flight today despite being refunded by AmEx months ago already!
"Update from me. I contacted my credit card company and they did a refund and were going to sort this out with Ryanair. This was back in the 24th of April (post #407). A couple of days a go Ryanair sent me an e-mail telling me that I was going to get a refund instead of the vouchers. Based on all the mess around this I thought it was too good to be true. But all of a sudden I noticed the refund from Ryanair on my account. They did not refund the whole amount, there was a difference of 150 SEK (approx 15 euro). I realized I did not have the energy to fight for that little amount of money, so I let that go.I contacted the credit card company and told them about the refund from Ryanair. They withdraw the money from the account, but let me keep the 15 euro. “We would like to keep our customers happy, meaning you should get back the whole amount for your tickets”.Even though the amount was very small, that is what I refer as good customer service. Ryanair could learn a bit from them. Anyway, they kept their promise (with som hustle) and refunded me. So no more bashing Ryanair from me. For you who are still waiting to get a refund, I hope my post give you hope. Over and out."
Same here. I never even got the voucher....
Have you contacted Ryanair about your missing voucher?
"Update on message 487 to give hope to some still waiting. Flight date 31/03 - 03/04Cancelled 21/03Voucher Received (but not accepted) 23/04Requested to be added to refund queue via Chatbot (using method in message 487) 27/04First ""Thank you for your patience e-mail"" 09/05Second ""Thank you for your patience e-mail"" 19/06""Your refund has been processed e-mail"" 02/07Money in account by 04/07"
"Thanks for the update, a bit of hope for the rest of us still waiting."
"Statement by Ryanair CEO yesterday reported on BBC says 90 % of customers who requested a refund for flights cancelled March to June will get their money by the end of July.Edited: 7:43 am, July 04, 2020 "
"We were a party of 7 due to fly to Seville on March 22nd. Ryan Air cancelled the flight but when we applied for a refund as instructed it took us to the option for vouchers. All attempts to get our money back have failed; impossible to contact by phone, email or live chat. Almost 4 months on and we are still out of pocket due to every approach being ignored. Yet Michael O'Leary appeared on Sky TV last week stating that all March and April refunds have been processed. How can he make a statement like that when people out there know full well this is not a fact. When will we get our money back or even will we get it back?"
Frances you could try facebook. But the chat has been working.Yesterday received an email that my refund for April 25th has been sent to the bank. I guess I'll see it in the next week. I can't remember when the flight was canceled but figure at least three months from the refund request.
"I've just had an email from Ryanair confirming that my refund has now been processed back to the form of payment used and will take 5-7 days for my issuing bank to process it back to my card.This was for flights on 1st and 4th May, hopefully this offers hope to others still waiting."
"We finally got our money on July, 10 for the flight in May."
That is not bad considering the global situation Kristina
"2 days ago finally received our refund through our bank, this was for flights with Ryanair for March.If I had not gone down the refund route with my bank I think I would still be waiting, it has taken the full 45 days for the bank to respond as well."
Ryanair have just notified me that my refund has been issued. I applied online and messaged them via face book. I didn't involve my bank.
Raw how long have you been waiting?
I requested a refund from Ryanair in April for cancelled flights to Italy. Since then I have been run around in circles. Next stage is to write a registered letter to Ryanair head office in Dublin and contact my credit card provider to see if they can help. Jim
Our flight was due to leave on March 22nd to Seville but was cancelled by Ryanair. We have been waiting 4 months now; a refund was requested before the end of March and we were led to believe this would be made. What actually happened was that a voucher was offered which we refused. Numerous approaches to Ryanair have been completely ignored.
"We had a similar experience to #552 and #553. We went to the creidt card provider we had used for the purchase of the flight, told them service had not been delivered, and we had a refund in our bank account within 3 days."
I've received my refunds for flights up to mid May. If you haven't received a refund for flights before then you should contact them again.
Refunds for flights in June came through last week
"New scam from Ryanair with the ""you can change your flights for free"" policy applying to bookings made in July, August or September.I tried to change the date on one of those flights, they announced absolutely everywhere that I was not gonna be paying the changing fee, all good for now. I actually changed a flight from one day in September to just a week earlier, also in September.Let's say the original flight booked by me a couple of weeks ago cost me 100€, then the new date I was trying to book was sold at 90€ (both in website and app), I thought, well, the new flight is cheaper, never mind.But here is the thing, when I tried to change the flight, selecting the new date inside the ""flight changing process"", the new date was showing at 150€, so they repeat once again that I was not paying the changing fee, but I have to pay the fare difference. Hey!! but that flight was 90€ and still is this price if you book it yourself outside the flight changing process.Is this actually legal? Why are they charging 60€ extra for the exact same product anyone else can buy if they are not changing flights?Why are they inflating prices in this very cheeky way?"
"Oscar,Why are they charging 60€ extra for the exact same product anyone else can buy if they are not changing flights?Did you ask them? Seems like a sensible approach to take first off, given the hypothetical example you've provided."
"Thanks for your reply, but the example is not really hypothetical, but unfortunately, it is very true.I probably didn't explain the situation properly.I wanted to change a flight using the ""1 free change card"", so when I am selecting the new date I wish to travel, they inflate the price of that new flight 30€ per segment (return flight). But if at the same time you check the real fare of that same flight outside the changing flight process, you get it 30€ cheaper.I've checked this in all of my pending flights from Ryanair and in all of them, they are increasing the real value of the flight at around a 30%, honestly, I believe this is not legal.They are offering two different prices for the same product, one price if you come to the site and wish to book that particular flight and another different price if you wish to travel that new date while changing your previously booked flight.Edited: 12:49 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"""Refunds for flights in June came through last week""I'm still waiting for my refund for my flight on 11th June!The flight was cancelled on 17th May and I put my refund request in straight away.There's no point trying to contact them because it's impossible to get hold of them by email, live chat, phone and even Twitter!"
Our July Dublin flight was cancelled and we had agreed to accept a voucher but they refunded the full fare last week to my surprise.

"I finally got through to the cowboys on livechat. They said they sent me my refund - a voucher!I told them to stop messing about because I requested a refund, not a voucher.They reluctantly said they would process the refund but it would take another 2 weeks.I made sure that I took a screenshot of the livechat because I don't trust them. If I had managed to contact them several weeks ago I wouldn't still be waiting. And if I didn't contact them at all I wouldn't even be getting a refund.If you are in the same situation and still waiting then contact them asap.I was due to travel on Eurostar last June and that was also cancelled. I requested a full refund on a Sunday and it was in my bank account 4 days later. They didn't even try and fob me off with a voucher.Unfortunately I am due to fly with Ryanair again in September. They have already moved one of the flights meaning I will lose one day of my trip. I swear to God I will never use them again after my next trip.Edited: 9:26 am, August 08, 2020 "
"I recommend anyone who has paid by credit card to submit the chargeback procedure to their bank. I have exported my e-mail traffic with the airline from the e-mail client to a zip file (I used the ImportExportTools NG extension for Mozilla Thunderbird for this) and submitted it to the person responsible at my bank. She then passed everything on to the credit card service manager. the money was booked back after 2 days, but we are waiting for the final decision of the credit card service provider. Good luck with your plans!"
Hi has anyone had this problem i used the voucher as i have to travel to see a sick relative but since using the voucher number Ryan Air have not sent me confirmation of the Flight etc so i dont know if im booked or Flight number I cnt get to talk to a person on any of there phone lines and when I used the on line chat box it keeps asking for the the reference number which I dont have am so confused .
