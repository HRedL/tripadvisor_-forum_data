"Today in DollarStore in London Ontario Canada, worker told client who just walked in, NO MASK ON. He stopped and dug one out. Logical, world blowing up, its raining, USE UMBRELLA."
"Good, he was apparently given a warning and chose to ignore it, so throw his entitled butt in jail for 36 hours. People should respect the laws of the place they choose to visit."
