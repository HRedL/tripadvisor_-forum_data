"https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2020/03/…This news article states that people with coronavirus-related respiratory symptoms will not be admitted to the islands. In addition, anyone who visited countries with an active outbreak in the last 30 days will not be admitted to the islands.This would surely disrupt travel plans for many, including mine. Does anyone have an information about which countries count as having ""active outbreak""? Does it include USA?Edited: 1:29 am, March 03, 2020 "
https:/…coronavirus-ecuador-controlesAnother article
"Seeing how I live in the coronavirus capital of the US (Kirkland, WA), this does not bode well for my end of April trip!"
Just about everywhere then.
"I believe the active outbreak countries to be:China, Italy,Iran and South KoreaOtherwise almost all countries in the world would be denied access to Galapagos, even citizens from mainland Ecuador as they now have 6 confirmed cases. No need to panic I hope as I am visiting the Galapagos next Sunday ;)"
"Dear Holla, as usual, Ecuadorian policy is made on the fly, coming out with them first and thinking about the details later. My understanding is that these will relate to the countries most likely on the USA ""Travel advisory"" system: China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy and Hong Kong. The government of Ecuador is of course doing all it can to keep Galapagos virus free - most of the people there depend on tourism for a living. For the time being, there are 6 cases reported in the country (not Galapagos) all from the same family I understand. Warmest regards,Heather Blenkiron"
"I understand that this is necessary, since I can see that the islands are quite distant from the mainland and medical facilities there would be very limited.A reasonable guess for now would be: restrictions for China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan. I just wanted to know where to find an official notice, so that I can refer to it should there be any addition of countries to the list.I also have a trip planned late April, so I'm keeping an eye on this issue."
"Its actually 7 cases as of last nighthttps://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/ecuado…Still related to the first, but these people almost certainly spread it. My (admittedly uninformed) fear is that Ecuadors health network won't be equipped to contain this and it will spread like wildfire. They are right to worry about and close down Galapagos, as, according to my Government at least,Galapagos is not equipped at all for any type of serious medical issue, let alone an outbreak requiring hospitalization of numerous people. Fingers crossed Ecuador (and the world) get a handle on this in the coming weeks.Edited: 10:43 am, March 03, 2020 "
"This is the official pagehttps:/…For the mainland, there are additional checks for people coming from China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain and Mexico.For Galapagos, they say countries that have 'an active outbreak as defined by WHO', except WHO doesn't use that classification, so it's not particularly helpful."
"Yeah, we're going in mid-April, and I'm a little concerned that we won't be able to go. OTOH, I'm not panicking about it - let's see what happens and hopefully we'll all be able to make the 'trip of a lifetime'."
We fly out the same day Susan (based on another thread). Hopefully a few Canucks can make it to the islands!
I received an e-mail from Lindblad saying that they'd give us a full refund if *they* cancelled or credit toward another cruise if we cancelled (with 30 days notice). I have a few weeks to wait and see what happens.
"My sources in Galapagos are telling me that more meetings are taking place there today to discuss the finer details of this proposed policy. Understandably, the local tourism people are asking for more precision on ""active outbreak"". I suspect we'll hear more shortly. FYI, medical facilities in Galapagos are actually quite good for a population of about 30,000. You would be hard pressed to find facilities of that quality in rural areas of mainland Ecuador. Warmest regards,Heather Blenkiron"
"Thomas K, hope to see you there!"
Updated email from Lindblad now is giving up to 24 hours before departure rather than 30 days if you need to change plans.
"Hi all-I inquired with my cruise operator today and she sent me the full PDF of the ruling. It is six pages long, so I only copy and pasted a short summary here. The first ""article"" restricts travel to the Galapagos for anyone who is symptomatic with coronavirus. The second ""article"" indicates the countries fully affected (all citizens) by the Galapagos restriction (China, South Korea, Iran, Italy). It also says that this list will be updated with official information from the MSP (Minister of Public Health):Resolución Nro. CGREG-ST-2020-0383-RPuerto Baquerizo Moreno, 02 de marzo de 2020 Art. 1.- Inadmitir el ingreso a la provincia de Galápagos a toda persona sintomáticarespiratoria que cumpla con la definición de caso “COVID-19”, conforme el protocoloestablecido por el Ministerio de Salud Pública (MSP).Art. 2.- Inadmitir el ingreso a la provincia de Galápagos a toda persona que registrevisitas en los últimos 30 días en los países que la Organización Mundial de la Salud(OMS), determine con brote activo de COVID-19, conforme el protocolo establecido porel MSP, actualmente estos países son China, Irán, Corea del Sur e Italia.La lista de países con brote activo de COVID-19, se actualizará conforme la informaciónoficial del MSP. So, I guess we will have to wait and see if other countries are added to the list. If anyone else gets updates like these, please post. Thanks!"
Thank you! This is what I was looking for.
Anyone else receive revised and more lenient cancel policies from their cruise lines besides Lindblad? We have not heard much except - can’t cancel at this time.
Also have a trip planned in a couple of months…..fingers crossed it all calms down a bit soon!
"Just put that into Google translate:Art. 1.- Inadmit (don't allow?) admission to the province of Galapagos to any symptomatic person. Respiratory that meets the case definition “COVID-19”, according to the protocol established by the Ministry of Public Health (MSP).Art. 2.- Inadmit (don't allow?) admission to the province of Galapagos to any person who registers visits in the last 30 days in countries that the World Health Organization (WHO), determine with active outbreak of COVID-19, according to the protocol established by The MSP, currently these countries are China, Iran, South Korea and Italy. The list of countries with active outbreak of COVID-19, will be updated according to the information MSP officer."
Our family of five is traveling to the Galapagos via Baltra Island from Florida on March 15th (less than a week). We’ll be crushed if the Ecuadorian Government doesn’t allow us entry. Does anyone have a source to reach out to in order to know for sure?
"Phoebe, read #8 here https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29430…"
The 'active' list keeps growing. Who knows which country will be next.Our family was supposed to go to the Galapagos Island tomorrow.We chose to postpone til this is over. We don't want to find ourselves quarantined in Ecuador or not be able to re-enter the US.Luckily Linblad/National Geographic tours is letting us reschedule our trip. And Jet Blue is waving the change fees.Better safe than sorry.
"People coming from China, Italy, South Korea and Iran won't be admitted in Galapagos for now and also people who have been to any of those 4 countries in the past 30 days. eldiario.ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/…"
My wife is holding a Chinese passport and I’m holding a Japanese passport but both live in Singapore as PR. Our planned trip is in April 23rd onward. This forum is very useful and helpful. I hope to collect more info and feedback from those who are there now so we can make the final call.
"I plan to travel to Galapagos from Cuenca, Ecuador on March 21. My husband will also be traveling to Galapagos on that day from NYC. So far, we have no changes to our travel plans. Of course, we will continue to monitor updates each day in case they announce any flight cancellations."
I heard there was a presidential address last night in Ecuador. Is there any addition to the list of restricted countries?
Planning to leave tonight from the US - if anyone has the latest would be really helpful
"According to Metropolitan Touring, the US is not restricted and they will not allow me to make any changes to our cruise on the Santa Cruz in April. I can only pray that a travel ban occurs or else I may have to sacrifice my $15,000 that is not covered by the travel insurance. At lease American Airlines has show mercy and will issue me a credit to use for the price of the flight."
"Universities, colleges, and schools are closed since today in Quito, there is a health emergency declared by the mayor of our city (Jorge Yunda). The City Hall is recommending public and private companies to allow workers to stay at home and work from home. Senior citizens are suggested not to leave their homes unless they have a real emergencyEcuador is starting to take good measurements in order to keep the population safe.Saludos cordiales from Quito,Dennis Yepez"
"I read the following news. My trip to Ecuador starts in 3 weeks, not sure whether I can make it or not. Any suggestion?EcuadorAs of March 12, Ecuador had 17 confirmed cases. As of March 10, Ecuador had 15 confirmed cases.Ecuador’s Health Minister Catalina Andramuño Zeballos confirmed the country’s first case on February 29. A 70-year-old Ecuadoran woman who lives in Spain and had traveled from Madrid on February 14 was eventually admitted into a Guayaquil hospital in critical condition. Nine other individuals who came in direct contact with the hospitalized patient subsequently tested positive for the virus, while authorities continue to monitor over 120 individuals who may come into contact with affected patients.President Lenín Moreno declared a national health emergency on March 11, requiring that all who travel to Ecuador from countries that have confirmed cases be placed under home quarantine and restricting events with large crowds across the country. The government also prohibited mass gatherings in Guayaquil and Babahoyo, the two places visited by the first confirmed carrier. The government prohibited mass gatherings in Guayaquil and Babahoyo, the two places visited by the first confirmed carrier. Ecuador’s National Institute of Public Health Research is in charge of monitoring the outbreak."
"Public events that held more than 1000 people are been prohibited since today in Quito too, this includes music concerts.Guns N´Roses rock band was performing this coming Saturday, March the 21st at the Olimpic Soccer Stadium Atahualpa, it's a pitty!Saludos cordiales from Quito,Dennis Yepez"
"I'm confused - WeiQ - you say that"" President Lenín Moreno declared a national health emergency on March 11, requiring that all who travel to Ecuador from countries that have confirmed cases be placed under home quarantine ...."" So basically that means that Canadians would have to be quarantined? Is that correct? Susan"
Has anyone had a health screening today? I’m wondering what it entails.
"Here's what the president of Ecuador said yesterday:""all passengers who come from countries with the highest number of reported cases must maintain home isolation for as long as the world health authorities recommend.""It's not clear to me which countries or how long the isolation is."
Can someone please post the site where it states those coming countries with highest numbers reported self quarantine. I’m having trouble finding the source and I would like to read it all. Thxs sooo much!!!! Bc like someone else said without naming specific countries that could be New York as well.
"We have our trip planned for one week from today - the 19th, coming from the United States. Really hoping between now and then we will get clarity about who will need to be quarantined!"
"I read the news from this website: https:/…ecuadorI have no other knowledge about the President's statement or the situation in Ecuador. I wish everyone smooth in their planned trip in Ecuador, and I hope I can make it too."
I found the article. In Spanish but with the use of google translate. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.expreso.ec/…
"Facebook post from the vice president https:/…The countries that will be put in quarantine are China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France and Spain."
"Any idea on what the situation is regarding transit countries? I'm due to travel in early May flying from Dublin (where government is being very proactive..as is my workplace) transiting at Schipol, The Netherlands. (75 min connection time). I imagine flights may be cancelled (we certainly still plan to go if we can) but if not and say the Netherlands goes onto the Quarantine list but Ireland isn't does anyone know what the situation would be?  I.e. if you are just having a short transit so dont actually set foot on soil in an affected country, would you still be quarantined because the second part of your flight originated from there?"
"Ponaire, you might do better by asking this question on the Air Travel forum. But my guess is--no one knows at this point how things will transpire six weeks from now.I saw on the Peru forum that flights from Asia and Europe have been suspended https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29431…A flight from the Netherlands is still a flight from Europe. I doubt officials would take the time to determine who set foot on European soil during a layover, and who did not."
"I cannot tell if it includes the US, but my guess is yes."
Does anyone know what could reasonably be expected for travel restrictions in July? I know I am asking for a crystal ball!!I am pretty sure COVID-19 will get worse in the US before it gets better...and the country could land on the quarantine list. What I am not sure of is how a country gets off the list.
"RiverFan2014,From what I understand, the US embassy in Quito is a good source of information. US Embassy phone number is 011-593-2-398-5000.But don't expect them to have a crystal ball either. They can help discern some of the ambiguity in the Ecuadorian situation (who will be quarantined, for how long, if/when US gets added to or taken off the list). I think, in your case, you're probably going to be patient and watch how this unfolds. No one is even sure what's going to happen next week, never mind in July. But, as you get closer to your trip, if you're not finding reliable information, I suggest contacting the US embassy in Quito."
"Also thinking that my bucket list trip in 3 weeks is going to be deferred. :( As of March 13, there are 20 cases: https:/… An agent with the travel company we've been working with relayed that on March 11, Ecuador has declared any visitor from a ""high case"" country (ie China, Italy, Spain, France, South Korea, Germany, Iran) will have to quarantine in an Ecuadorian hotel for 14 days upon arrival. I am from the US, but given the trajectory of cases, would not be surprised if the US finds itself on the ""high cases"" list.Currently looking into options with our travel company and the travel insurance. Depending on refund options, we may have to move this out a year :( Anyone else taking these steps, or have recommendations to minimize fees/penalties of having to postpone by a year? The airlines especially don't seem like they'll accommodate without penalty since it'll be beyond 2020. However, given the weather and the likely animals, I really want to go during the wet season (March ideally)."
Does anyone know if Germany is confirmed as being on the list?
"Hi Freddy, Germany is confirmed. Had to cancel everything. Would have gone to GPS on 21st :/"
"**latest update**Ecuador requires mandatory 14-day self-quarantines for travelers who have been in, transited through, or are arriving from the U.S. states of California, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington, as well as China’s Hubei and Guangdong provinces, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland."
"I am in the midst of cancelling our trip :( So disappointing, but the Canadian government issued a global travel advisory today. I did buy cancellation insurance earlier today (before the announcement) so hopefully I won't be too much out of pocket. However, there are much bigger problems than my travel budget."
"Thanks for the update, thats me out too, transiting CDG AMS or JFK were only options on ticket we have. Avianca not refunding Ecuadorian domestic tickets as of yet"
"Hi all, does anyone know if the same restrictions apply if you are from the UK but have been travelling in South America for 7 weeks, so not directly coming from any of the effected countries. We are currently in Peru and are unsure when we start our way over to Ecuador if we will need to be quarantined there, Peru will also shortly be banning flights in and out to Europe so we have no other choice but to press on with our route...Any advise would be appreciated."
"Canada has just advised all Canadians abroad to return to Canada immediately ""while they still can"""
Hi Will. The vice president was just on TV. Ecuador will not allow any international flights to land from midnight tomorrow. Ports will be closed too. They are leaving two land borders open (1 in the north and 1 in the south). But the country is going into lock down with residents told to stay home. https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/medida…
I am in Ecuador currently. Do we need to head to the airport or risk getting stuck here?
"I can't find any information on an expected timeframe for this policy - our trip is in July and wondering if we should wait it out or cancel now. Do any of the pages in Spanish mention an expected duration for this lockdown/policy? We're coming from Washington State USA, so we're on the list."
Where can I read about this and find out more information?
"Dear Laurie,if you're not scheduled to go until July, just hang tight. Talk to your agent. They should know what's going on. Check your cancellation policy, your insurance policy if you have one. Right now, things are basically closing down big time - my friends in Galapagos say it's like a ghost town there right now. Some ships are anchoring indefinitely. Warmest regards,Heather Blenkiron"
"I would also like to know. I have trip to Galapagos planned for the end of May.Edited: 7:04 pm, March 14, 2020 "
I want to be anchored indefinitely there!!!
Yes! Go!is what I am gathering
https://www.ecoventura.com/ecoventura-update…This is the best info I have found.
I hate to rain on your parade but:https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coron…Basically all world wide travel should be cancelled ASAP. Hunker down until it's over.
"This is effective for 21 days, we travel in 77 days, we have locked down our borders this weekend too (New Zealand), not sure if to cancel or wait and see a couple of weeks, my holiday of a lifetime too!"
"Unless it's a financial choice (i.e., you can definitely get a full refund now, but might not be able to in the future), then there's no point making a decision now about a trip that is still a couple of months away. Anything could happen between now and then."
"Hi, Me too, also departing 28th May, we are flying LATAM and they are currently only offering changes up to end of April, Ecuador has just closed to all visitors for 21 days, I am thinking to hold back a couple of weeks to see if all these measures improve the situation, if not we will cancel mid April, what will you be doing?"
Frightening. I would be so sad to have to reschedule our trip but I can’t imagine being abroad with this going on.
"Unless I were 97 years old or something I would just be re-arranging my plans for the following year. Be responsible and have an understanding of previous epidemic situations. In all cases the government minimized, denied, lied etc. to protect the precious economy. That's happening now too, but the governments' ability to get away with it is less due to the existing communication stream being more developed."
I have just been informed that the borders are now closed - no arrivals no departures.
"Almost closed, but not quite yet. The borders will be closed to incoming foreigners from 23.59 tonight. People will still be able to leave, subject to flights being available."
"That accords with what I have been told by someone on the islandsEdited: 12:53 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I'm a US citizen in Santa Cruz at the moment. I have the announcement from the Ministry of Foreign Travel (or whatever its called). Flights inbound to Ecuador are suspended at midnight on the 15th, but flights outbound are permitted. The bigger issue is the airline cancellations. Additionally, its possible that outbound flights from the Galapagos to the mainland will end Monday night which is what we are dealing with at the moment."
https://coronavirusecuador.comse plantera un protocolo para ingresso y salida a las islas galapagos
The departures have not been restricted. https://m.facebook.com/photo.php…
"My daughter has a cruise booked for May and she was told that as of this point, it is still going ahead. I don't see how that is possible since it is unlikely that many people can get to Ecuador at this point."
"The current restrictions are for 3 weeks. The major airlines are saying they will resume normal service in May. It's quite possible that that won't actually happen, and that the restrictions will be extended, in which case the cruise company will probably cancel it anyway, but for now, she will have to wait and see if/when that happens."
Thank you for the update
My trip is not until July and I'm happy to wait it out. My biggest concern is a hefty final payment due mid April. I will check with my agent but have to consider cancelling now before that payment is due. Not sure my travel insurance will cover...I will need to read that.
I am too. Some cruses have been cancelled. Are they offering refunds?
"Gunny23, I would be wary about making a final payment for a trip in July. Not many experts predicting this to be over that soon"
Hi I was wondering if you found out the answer to your question. My cruise is offer a limited amount of options to rebook at no fee. Otherwise if I want to move it to the same time next year we have to pay $500usd each! which is alot. They already have full payment so not many options. If we cancel we get nothing back
I reached out to my agent today and he is checking w the operator. That is a big jump in price. I don't think we will make any payments until we know things are cleared or we can re book for same price for a later date. I feel bad because I know the Galapagos relies on tourism but this is to expensive of a trip :-(
"Our cruise was supposed to be mid April, so unfortunately we have fully paid. I hope you have better luck."
"I am fully paid up and they cancelled the cruise and are offering limited options for this year. Humboldt currents from June to December makes for an uncomfortable cruise, besides there is no telling when travel restrictions will be lifted. They are asking $1050 extra per person for same time next year. Daylight robbery!Edited: 2:30 am, March 21, 2020 "
"Dear TravelTips,this is not robbery - let's keep things in persepctive. It is highly likely that the terms and conditions of your booking indicate no reimbursement should you not be able to take the cruise for reasons beyond the ship's control. That is pretty standard. Did you buy insurance to cover such situations?Of course, most ships recognize that despite the policy absolving them of any responsibility, it's good business practice to do their best to mitigate things for their guests. Some are doing more than others - it all depends on the situation each ship faces financially, along with their individual projections of future prospects.While tourism plans for many millions of people such as you have just been kiboshed by COVID-19, let's not forget that the very livelihoods of millions of people working in tourism industry have just been destroyed for the foreseeable future. I know, on a personal basis, a good 75 people who woke up one day this week to learn that they'll have to figure out another way to put food on the table and pay school fees for their children in the coming months. BTW - I'm one of them ;-) Though I am good for a long while, I will now be living on savings only - I'm glad restaurants have all be shuttered where we live - removing that temptation at least. I hope this helps to clarify the situation.Warmest regards,Heather BlenkironEdited: 7:59 am, March 21, 2020 "
"Dear Heather, Please understand THEY cancelled the cruise! All cruise lines the world over offer refunds and incentives to boot for rebooking for cancelled cruises. https:/…po-cruises-10 Charging an additional 25% is beyond any justification. How hard it is to reschedule a limited number of people over a course of 1 year which is going to be a soft any way?Fully understand the economy depends on tourism but such action is counterproductive. They cancel the trip and then ask us to pay a penalty!Edited: 12:25 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"I understand the difficult situation that everyone is in, but that doesn't mean that people who have planned and saved for these cruises aren't in similar situations. I know rates for cruises change each year, but it shouldn't change that much in my opinion. They had my money last year already"

"TA has a specific forum for cruises, but most likely it is centered on the very large ships; click the All drop down menu next to Browse forums to find it. Did you work with a travel agent? Do you have travel insurance?"
"Hi, This is the only one I've found. Did your cruise cancel or tell you what they would do instead? Which boat were you taking?"
"Thanks. Ya, definitely for the bigger cruises.I am working with a Travel Agent. They are great. But they and we are waiting as it's still some time away. Things are changing daily still. We have Credit Card Travel Insurance. But if even eligible under force majeur, would only cover up to a max of $2k it looks like. Just wanted to see what has been happening with people who have cruises right now, and in the upcoming weeks. So we can help each other out."
"In that case, I suggest you start a new thread with a title that better reflects your topic. Glad to hear you have a good agent. I think a lot of this is a game of chicken, waiting to see what changes the governments/companies will institute. I'm playing that game now for an early May trip."
"I have a little more time than you as I don't cruise until July. I am equally concerned. I am hesitant to make my final payment until I have a firm commitment on options for postponing etc. We WILL go eventually...this is a ""done deal"" trip for us and as luck would have it..the itinerary/cruise we picked would mean my daughter would get to celebrate her 11th bday somewhere around Isabela Island. I really hope we can make this trip but I'm also hoping we can just postpone until April -July next year. I don't want to risk her health. We are in wait and see mode. I'm cruising w Huagan and have little info on how they are handling summer reservations.My fingers are crossed. My agent has been great and resonsive but I think dealing with customers who are more immediately impacted.I hope this all works out for you. Happy to share any info I get but since I don't go until July you will probably have info sooner than I."
"We are pretty much in the same position as you are Gunny23. We booked with our travel agent through Kensington tours, doing a 4 day private tour in Guayaquil and then onto a small yacht (m/s Infinity) for 4 days. Our final payment is due 4/30, and we have already invested thousands as a deposit, paid months ago. We do have trip insurance, but it does not cover pandemics. We are tied into the dates we booked, as vacation time was booked with jobs and can't be changed. We would get back (hopefully) most of our $$ less a $350 pp ""administrative fee"" (4 of us) if we canceled, plus any other expenses (air from Guayaquil to Baltros Island if it was booked already) It is a tough call, as the ""social distancing rule"" has now been extended to 4/30. We are especially hard-hit here in NY. I will wait one more week to see what happens, but I think our bucket list trip will have to wait until next year."
That would be awesome if you could your money back minus the admin fee. I'm afraid I will lose all of my deposit. I too have insurance but pandemics are not covered.Hopefully they will allow me to postpone. Good luck to you.
"if you have travel insurance - and flights have been cancelled to Ecuador because of the ban, aren't you covered by trip cancellation insurance because the airline was the one that cancelled?"
"I hope so! But debatable. I keep reading that it is not covered under insurance due to fine print re: force majeur. Even if it is covered, a lot of policies have a max amount... which likely would not cover the cost of the cruise. I'm still waiting for final cancellation of flight before I escalate to Credit Card and others. Especially as hold times are hours long."
I can’t find anything on line if Ecuador is extending its border closure beyond April 7th...
I can't see how they don't. It appears to be pretty serious if you follow some of the social media posts. #guayaquilI am assuming at this point I am not going to the Galapagos in July :-(
"The harsher restrictions (no work, strict curfews, etc) have been extended until April 5th, and the Mayor of Quito has said they may continue, in Quito at least, beyond that, but he was talking in terms of days rather than weeks. However, it also sounds like they will be relaxing things very gradually when it does start to change, and it's also likely to vary around the country. There has been no indication that borders will re-open any time soon.Guayaquil is in a bad way now, largely because so many of the residents have refused to follow the rules in terms of self-isolation, curfews, etc., A huge number of the current cases can be traced back to a couple of people who failed to follow the home quarantine rules when they returned from Europe. But it's not just Coronavirus, the current Dengue outbreak isn't helping either. I'm expecting them to keep Guayaquil quarantined for much longer."
"Dear Libby,while Ecuador may eventually open its borders again, they may choose to open them selectively only to countries that are showing that the COVID-19 is well under control. We are not out of the woods anytime soon I should think.Warmest regards,Heather Bleniron"
Did she get a refund or credit?
Have you had any luck yet?
"Has anyone found a decent source of information for Ecuador? Specifically about the border closures, and no access to Galapagos? Best I found so far was the US embassy's website, or wikipedia. Both are out of date though, and still say closures until April 5. https:/…""The Government of Ecuador has prohibited all foreigners and most Ecuadorians from arriving via air, land, or sea. As of March 17, Ecuador has also prohibited domestic passenger flights and restricted entry to the Galapagos Islands. At this time, we understand these restrictions are scheduled to be in place until April 5.""https:/…9320_coronavirus_pandemic"
"GS, scroll down a couple of threads in the forum and you'll see a recent post by DE Heather; the borders are still closed until at least the end of April, and no large gatherings until the end of May."
thank you!
"Did this get resolved? We used them last year, and we were going back later this year, but will NOT use them if you were mistreated."
"C Lo, whom are you addressing in this 12-page thread?"
We also booked everything to go to Galapagos in april and luckily we got almost all our money back or a voucher at least. The only thing we don't seem to get back is our booking with Galapagos Transfers. We had to cancel our booking and we don't get any answer to our mails so probably loose our money there. Anyone familiar with this transfer company?
