"We make your knowledge that starting today 27/07/2020, by the disposal of the High-Level Commission for the Prevention and Control of Coronavirus, a specialized state medical body is applying a quick test to all passengers arriving in the Dominican Republic, in all airports.⁣Those passengers who bring with them a negative result of a COVID19 test carried out in the last 5 days, no quick test is required upon arrival in the country.We ask for your collaboration respecting physical distancing in the ranks, as well as your patience in the face of the additional time involved in complying with this new mandatory request provided by the Dominican authorities.⁣We count on your collaboration!-----------------------------------------------------------------------Angie."
Thanks Angie. May be an incentive for folks to get tested prior to departure. Would avoid travelling all the way there and get flagged.
"Like most things now there seems to be a lot of confusion on things. Read this on DR1. Testing for Covid-19 suspended at Dominican airportsContinue reading...Aerodom, the largest airport operator in the country, announced that the government has suspended late on Monday, 27 July 2020 the requirement for Covid-19 testing at Dominican airports. The requirement lasted less than 24 hours.Aerodom earlier had announced that they would be complying with the requirement made by the High Commission for the Prevention and Control of Coronavirus. This was that starting Monday, 27 July 2020, Covid-19 rapid response blood tests were required of all arriving passengers. Passengers who arrived with a certificate showing they had tested negative for Covid-19 within the previous five days would not have to take the blood test.The Dominican Republic is undergoing a spike in the spread of the virus. The tests were applied by Dominican government medical staff at international airports, with delays in passengers clearing the terminals.The High Commission for the Prevention of Coronavirus did not publicly announce the testing requirement...Edited: 7:26 am, July 28, 2020 "
"Darn well not sure I'd want a blood test though... Can't believe that this would make sense as they would not have results before guests arrive at resort anyway. I can see where travellers will need to take the test at home before departure if this thing doesn't get better soon or no vaccine. I'd be OK with this. if you want or must travel, take a test first."
"Found this report from Diario LibreRapid tests to detect COVID-19 suspended at airport passengersIt was reported that a percentage of the travelers will be made randomlyOn instructions from the High-Level Commission for the Prevention and Control of Coronavirus, rapid tests to detect the coronavirus that were being carried out at some airports in the country were suspended . The test began to be applied this Monday.The management of the Corps Specialized in Airport Security and Civil Aviation (CESAC) made the communication at 8:00 at night to personnel from Dominicanos Siglo XXI Airports (Aerodom) explaining that the measure would be evaluated for future application.According to information supplied to Diario Libre, hereafter they will randomly refer the test to a percentage of the passengers entering the country.""The processing time per passenger is a minimum of 10 minutes, which implies that processing a flight of 150 passengers with 5 test machines would take between 4 and 5 hours,"" said José Luis López, director of Communications at Aerodom.This Monday, July 27, Aerodom reported that it was carrying out the rapid test to determine if a person has COVID-19. Likewise, at the Cibao International Airport, located in Santiago, they were also conducting the test.TestimonialsSome passengers who arrived today on flights from the United States and Europe told Diario Libre that they were subjected to the rapid test by a body of epidemiological doctors who were on duty at the José Francisco Peña Gómez terminal.Francisca Escoto, who traveled on flight 1409 of JetBlue airline, coming from New York, said that she was subjected to the process, like those who accompanied her, two teenagers who came to the country with her.Also Perfecto Polanco, who arrived on Iberia flight 6501 from Spain, said that he and the other passengers on that flight went, first through a feverish monitoring process, and then they performed the test to leave the air terminal and enter to the country.This Monday it was observed that members of the National Police and the Specialized Corps of Airport Security and Civil Aviation (CESAC) prohibited entry to the airport building by people who came to dismiss family and friends. These were left at a distance of between 25 and 50 meters so that they could say goodbye to theirs.https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/suspe…---------------------------------------------------------------------Angie."
