Does anyone have concerns traveling now and being in large busy airports on the way to your vacation ?
Caribbean? Today? No.Ask me again in a week or two.
"Yes. Not changing any plans, but definitely taking advised precautionary measures."
A cruise ship was refused permission to dock at port today in Ocho Rios today and it’s now anchored a mile offshore. This is a breaking story but there is concern that a person may possibly have the Coronavirus. Could also just be the govt being very cautious.
No. The govt banned flights to and from China. Local Chinese are laying low.
I’m more concerned about Dengue fever.
"Cebakes, you’re correct. Here’s the article:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mirror.co.u…"
I just got back and only saw 2 people with masks.Thing is you don't know where the plane your getting on has been.
Same as #5.
Concerned but not stopping how I live my life.
"We are planning to take a trip in late April and I'm not counting on it actually happening. If it does then I will just be grateful. I feel worse about the people whose livelihoods depend on tourists and travel, it will be financially devastating for them."
We are watching the news and still debating on if we are going to book a vacation
"Use this link for the story about the cruise ship being denied a port arrival in Ochi: https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/jam…No need to give Google funding for the reference.Local media coveragejamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/…jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20200225/cr…Edited: 2:22 am, February 26, 2020 "
We'll be seeing this happening a lot more in the coming months! Health systems in the region are well advised to practice prevention and precautionary methods like this.
"I didn’t have any worries, but just read on the RDCB Facebook page that a group of 50 from northern Italy are arriving Saturday! We arrive the same day. I hope Jamaica considers shutting off flights from high incidence countries."
That would make sense. Guess we just have to see if they will be allowed entry. People can get from high incidence countries by traveling through an intermediate point. That's what will make control of spread so difficult.
"""a group of 50 from northern Italy are arriving Saturday""What are they thinking? If I lived in an area with an outbreak I would self-quarantine. That's 50 people who are potential vectors to a country that is so far untouched. They should not be allowed on the plane."
It will be interesting to see if those 50 are admitted entry to Jamaica. Jamaica has does everything right so far and I would think anyone from Italy is going to get a extra close look at Immigration. Those 50 may not even make it out of Italy or Europe. I guess i will be avoiding all the Italians at Charela inn. ...Just kidding.
We are not due till June but the full balance is due mid March with the virus things are changing every day it only seams to be getting worse at the mo
We are leaving on the 7th of March to Jamaica. We live in the Netherlands. There are no infected in the Netherlands yet but it gets closer every day. Lot's of new infected people in Germany at the moment. Let's hope for the best!
"My husband and daughter will be traveling to Kingston in April for spring break. So far there are no known cases in Jamaica, keeping fingers crossed but my concern is any type of quarantine coming back. If anyone traveling there in the next month can update us when they come back (as far as how/if any procedures have changed) that would greatly be appreciated!"
"""I hope Jamaica considers shutting off flights from high incidence countries.""They are currently not allowing any vessels from China entrance to the country. They just this week turned away a cruise ship. So they are more than considering - they are being proactive."
"Us to going to rose hall resort in 5 weeks, not sure what will happen"
Please can you give link to this. I can’t find RCDB Facebook page. Thanks.
"The cruise ship that was refused docking in Jamaica (Ochi) was also refused docking in the Caymans.It finally docked in Mexico (Cozumel), but no one was allowed to disembark.Can find no published reference about ships from China not be allowed to dock in Jamaica. Off loading goods from transport ships from China has no risk as viruses do not live very long outside their host. Allowing crew off is a different discussion."
Jamaica added four more countries today to the list requiring restrictions. Italy is on the list.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/More_countrie…
I guess than it would be safe to say the 50 From Italy mentioned in post #16 won’t be traveling or would be denied entry?
leaving in three weeks to runaway bay maybe we will see you there
Very safe to say they will be denied entry or permission to travel. There are now more than 600 cases in Italy
It’s the Royal Decameron Cornwall Beach Resort. It’s a private group so can’t share the link.
"Leaving Tuesday night from SFO to Ziva. A little worried, but will follow hand washing, clorox wiping, mask wearing decorum."
"As to those tourists arriving from Italy (or previously planning to arrive from Italy), the Jamaican Ministry of Health in this webpage ( https:/… ) flushed out some of the details of those arriving from countries on the ""virus list"" which reads:""persons who have visited Italy, South Korea, Iran and Singapore in the last 14 days and who do not have permanent residency or marriage exemption in Jamaica will not be granted landing privileges at any of the country’s ports of entry;""It is not clear, from the above referenced webpage, if there are more countries on the ""virus list"" such as China (which would seem to be obvious)."
Leaving a week from tomorrow. Not woried. Jamaicans are up on this! jamaicaobserver.com/your-health-your-wealth/…
"MrsBetsy, wearing a mask will not prevent the virus from entering. They are effective for health care professionals as the design is far better than that of a surgical mask. The water droplets caring the virus are smaller than the webbing of the mask and far to many ""ordinary"" folks wearing the surgical mask keeps readjusting it, touching it, scratching face under it. All will allow the virus inside you.I extracted this from the health pages of CNN:""Infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Health that the N95 is still the recommended face mask for health professionals, because it has the capacity to filter out very small particles that could possibly contain the virus. “This is different than a surgical mask, which can only stop larger droplets,” says Dr. Adalja.The N95 is designed to achieve ""a very close facial fit,"" according to the Food and Drug Administration, and if properly fitted blocks ""at least 95%"" of very small test particles, though it doesn't completely eliminate the risk of illness, per the FDA.Right now, the advice from the CDC is that health care workers use “respiratory protection (i.e., a respirator) that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator before entry into the patient room or care area.” Additionally, all staff should be medically cleared and fit-tested if using a disposable N95 mask and trained in the proper use, safe removal, and disposal of the mask.While those who work in health care settings are advised to wear the N95 face mask, there is no such advisory for the general public. The N95 face mask is only recommended for health professionals dealing with patients who may be infected with the coronavirus. No face mask is advised for people who don't work in health care settings where coronavirus poses a risk.“Masks are not highly effective for the general public, who often don’t wear them correctly,” says Dr. Adalja. In fact, he stresses that the demand for the N95 and other face masks by the public may create supply problems for those who actually need them.There is no situation in which a face mask might provide increased protection to the general public, even during air travel, says Dr. Adalja."""
"""“Masks are not highly effective for the general public, who often don’t wear them correctly,” says Dr. Adalja.

The past 3 years have been lousy with fires in my neck of the woods in California. Those things go flying off the shelves (along with generators) within minutes it seems. I finally ordered a stash so we have plenty for us and our neighbors come fire season this fall.I've been hearing that too that masks do nothing to prevent the spread of this thing. Wash your hands compulsively, (sing the Happy Birthday song twice), and don't touch your face. Bone up your immune system with vitamins and diet. Since I travel so much I think I might invest in a few pairs of cotton gloves to wear in airports and on the airplane.And try not to worry too much, stress is a killer."
I have a trip planned for Negril Jamaica first week of May I'm not sure if I should try to cancel it or should I wait it out
We are due in early June and are full balance is due in 2 weeks we are also wondering what to do it seems to be spending so fast

"Unless there is a vaccine developed some doctors are now saying that this may be with us for a while, probably beyond this year. Like the usually influenza viruses we normally get, most people will probably contract Covid-19 at some point. If the Chinese failed to contain it then no one can."
"I am a little worried, but I don’t think it will stop me from going. I saw that Jamaica put a ban on people traveling from South Korea and Iran and Italy so I am hoping that will help with the spread of the virus."
"We’re supposed to be going in 6 weeks, and as much as we love our home away from home, I’m very concerned about being in a third world country in the middle of an epidemic. Worst case scenario would be contacting it on the way there and being quarantined in a Jamaican hospital. We’re waiting to see what happens, but it’s not looking too good"
Suspected Case In Jamaicatelevisionjamaica.com/primetimenews/video/17…
"My next trip is in about a month. I am a bit concerned, but but I don’t think it will stop me from going. A very fluid situation, and I have been following closely. I am more concerned about getting there -- air travel through major airports -- than actually being in Jamaica."
Ditto. Trying to live our lives. Cautiously. Headed to runaway bay in few weeks if all looks good.
"I was going to be traveling the first week of April, but I’m traveling with a one year old, and from a large airport. I am thinking of cancelling my trip today as my state has two new cases of the virus. I just don’t want to be quarantined in another country with a small baby. Honestly the airport scares me more than Jamaica."
We are set to go to Montego Bay Royal Caribbean in 5 weeks but concerned with things changing daily. Worried about getting stuck there. Has anyone ever used the travel ins to cancel. Do you get all of your money back?
"From what I'm hearing from others, travel insurance doesn't cover cancellation due to coronavirus. I'd check your policy."
From what I’m reading only if you had bought a cancel for any reason policy which I unfortunately could not get in NY
"Patti what insurance did you buy? Tripmate, the one offered by Sandals? It has a 'cancel for any reason"" waiver. If you cancel for a non-covered reason, like just not wanting to take a risk on coronavirus, then depending on how far off the trip is, you would get a combination of cash and vouchers (basically allowing you to re-book). It would not cover the air portion. If it is a covered reason (travel ban?), then both land and air would be covered and refunded."
I was booked for Montego Bay in May (with my husband and son). Cancelled today simply because I would not want to be quarantined in Jamaica (if it happened). Seems like too much of a risk for us.
"Same here, I have a small baby. It’s not worth the risk for us. We sadly cancelled today as well. We’re you able to get your flights refunded? I haven’t been able to."
I used dividend miles through American airlines so they refunded me the $136 tax per ticket (3 tickets) but then had to pay them $200 to get my miles refunded back into my account. And the $300 deposit I put down at Liberty Travel was able to be changed one time so I booked a hotel in Washington DC for 3 days 2 nights mini vaca ( we live 3 hours from DC). I didn't want to lose that $300. Figure likely not to get virus but if we do we are in the states so can receive good health care.
"Glad you at least didn’t loose the $300, hope you have a good mini vacay. My thoughts exactly, I rather be home just Incase."
"For those with kids, right now (at least) this virus doesn't seem to be affecting children. It seems the largest risk groups are adults over 30."
"Jamaica vacation canceled due to Corona virus. We were planned on coming in April, staying a week in Ocho/Port Antonio and a week in Negril. I researched and waited for this trip for 1.5 years. Disappointed doesn’t begin to describe how I feel. So far, we are out $375 in deposits, hoping to recoup the non-refundable airline tickets. Just wait for other airlines to match JetBlue no cancellations fees. Jamaica will have to wait for another time."
"We too are in the same situation. Supposed to be arriving April 4 for 7 nights to Sandal ochi. We booked our trip back in January before the Coronavirus hit. I have an underlying lung condition (but it doesn't keep me from doing everyday life) and thr dr cleared me to go before we booked.Went to see the same Dr today and he recommends that I now not go on this trip at the moment. We only have a few days left to cancel and only get 1/2 of our money back. Already called our trip insurance policy and go figure the plan we have does not cover a pre existing medical problem. However i feel this is not our fault since the dr cleared me to go before the virus came. We called sandals and they are allowing us to reschedule until July. However it looks like this virus isnt going anywhere anytime soon. I think the virus will still be an issue come july. For those of us in this situation there has to be some kind of legal help. Im getting ready to lose 3500.00 over something that happened in China. This is not fair we will be out of 3500.00.Edited: 3:49 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Kim do you have the Tripmate insurance through Sandals? If so, their cancel for any reason waiver should kick in and your non-refundable $3500 would be covered in the form of a voucher."
We went through a travel agency. We bought travel insurance through Roam Right but got the basic plan. I will double check with travel agent though.
"No.Life goes on.Leaving in five days for Negril.We are staying in a villa...if it was a resort I might think twice.We will sort of keep to ourselves, blissing out.Bringing plenty of antibacterial wipes for the journey itself."
Going to Montego bay next month. My worst fear is becoming ill - maybe coronavirus-maybe not -while there and getting shipped from resort to a hospital or quarantine facility there.Will trip insurance with medical evac coverage pay to bring you back to US? I looked at Website and in bold type it reminded everyone that epidemics and pandemics are excluded from coverage.
I'm leaving Saturday to go to White House. I have everything I need to take precaution. I wasn't really worried until I came across this article - what was he thinking? jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/202…
Does it allowed to have antibacterial wet wipes in carry on luggage?Thanks!
"jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/…Just read this. Glad the MOH is stepping it up. My suggestion to those of you who have plans on coming to the island is to monitor your temp. Start 36 hours before your flight. If you’re running a fever, even a low grade one, (usually before symptoms and before you start feeling sick), stay home. You can bring wipes in your carry on.. they’re not considered a liquid.Edited: 3:12 pm, March 04, 2020 "
Great fo the airports.Still wondering about the decision made related to that cruise ship which allowed the landing of passengers unless they originated in Italy.
That was a crappy decision and I’m sure he’s regretting it. But I do know those passengers were screened before they got off the ship. I’m more concerned about cruise lines lying to the govt about having people in quarantine.
"Cant live our lives in a bubble, being in a crowded airport is no different than being in a mall or grocery story. Have you seen Costco on a Saturday? We leave on the 21st for grand palladium and cant wait. Its about risk management. Even if you were to get it there, your symptoms are not going to show up till you are home."
"Actually, that’s not true unless you’re taking a very short trip. WHO website says the incubation period is 1-14 day with 5 being the most common."
"Iriestar, while that article gives me comfort on one level it scares the heck out of me on another. So it’s basically saying if someone gets off the plane next week and shows a temp they will be put in quarantine? We will of course take our temps before heading to the airport (and have no reason to have high temps) but there are many reasons you could have a higher temperature that has nothing to do with the coronavirus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease even food poisoning..Edited: 8:16 pm, March 04, 2020 "
Keep an eye on your flights . We are doing an Alaskan cruise in May. Our flight from Vancouver to Cincinnati was canceled today. Spent hrs on the phone. My Delta rep I was talking to was in MoBay. Delta made it right. Now the Ship isn’t allowed into San Francisco. The rep told me several flights were being affected.
"#68 yes. If you are running a fever you will be quarantined. A fever is an indication that your body is fighting an infection and they can’t diagnose that infection without a test. So, yes, show up with a fever and you will be quarantined and tested for Corona. Personally, i think they should be testing people for the flu as well as that seems to be killing more people than Corona. We don’t want your flu or Corona.Edited: 7:23 am, March 05, 2020 "
"I am not going on vacation to be worrying about a virus, I go on vacation to relax.I leave on the 12th of April, I am not going to cancel my trip, I'm going to enjoy it.It's not the black plague, its a virus.Get a grip people!"
#70. A fever is NOT always an indication of a virus or bacterial infection. “We don’t want your flu or Corona”. Well that’s an obvious statement and I’m sure everyone in the world feels that way but thanks for sharing because I just wasn’t sure.
"""As per the Aerodrome Emergency Response Plan (AERP) regarding communicable diseases, passengers that meet criteria number one (signs or symptoms) or criteria number 2 (travel history) will be quarantined and transported to an off-site Ministry of Health facility by the Public Health Nurse/MoHW and given requisite provisions;""if every passenger who arrives with a fever will now be quarantined in an off-site Ministry of Health facility, along with anyone who develops these symptoms during their stay , won't the volume of people quickly overwhelm whatever facilities they have? With all due respect, Jamaica does not have the resources of the USA to handle a situation like this. Here in NY, they have quarantined over 1,000 people because one attorney came down with the virus and passed it on to his wife and kids. They are mostly all quarantined at home. If you are a tourist in one of the hotels, they ill remove you, and you cannot go home to quarantine.We are just very concerned about this possibility, even though the risk of it happening is probably low."
"#72 glad you caught my drift and yes, a fever is an indicator that your body is fighting something."

I'm due to leave to Jamaica the 29th of March. I don't know what to do.
When are you due to go ? I leave the 29 of March. Flying out of ewr newwark nj on United.
We fly out of Toronto on May 9. Worried about possible travel restrictions being placed but who knows what will happen by then. WHO says travel restrictions are not suggested...
"AB take a breath. You are going to be okay. Go and enjoy yourself, it's only a virus like the cold if you even get it.A vacation is to relax and enjoy, if you can't do that than maybe you should cancel.I really hope you go and enjoy yourself."
Finally a sensible comment.
"Just got to Negril, non-stop flight from MN, no problems at all."
"cat2121, can you describe the processing you experienced when you arrived. For example, thermometer test, distribution of hand sterilizer, airport staff in masks, longer review of the immigration form looking a countries you have visited, special signage regarding the virus?"
They said no problems at all.........
Thank you. Traveling to Jamaica next week.
"Was asking about process, not problems. For instance, the entry folks at Costco are now wiping down the push bar and kids seat on the shopping carts as you enter their store.Do not consider this a problem, but a change in process, and that is what I was asking about."
"We arrived on Monday to Montego Bay and heading back to Canada tomorrow. Very quick through customs, but perhaps that was before these new measures. There was nothing different, other than being asked our travel history. There were only 2 people on our plane wearing masks and no one in Jamaica. Honestly everyone has been very chill here. It’s like the virus doesn’t exist! I’m pretty paranoid though and probably would have canceled our trip if we’d come any later. I just would not want to get sick or be quarantined here."
"Going thru customs is well after entering the airport and after immigration and luggage reclaim. Any special activities before entering the immigration hall, like handing out sanitation tissues or something similar.Edited: 1:50 pm, March 08, 2020 "
We are too are leaving on the 29th out of Philly.... also concerned. Not as much about Jamaica as the plane
we leave on the 24th of this month! excited but will take precautions like wipes for the seats hand washing etc. GOD is in charge! pray and go have fun!

Going to runaway bay in 2 weeks. Anyone have any updated thoughts on this?
"Was able to cancel my trip to Montego Bay in 2 weeks. Got hotel fully refunded and airfare credit to use within 12 months. We're disappointed of course, but the risk of getting stuck in a Jamaican hospital or quarantine for weeks was too great for us, for medical reasons. Hopefully we will be able to rebook this trip for next year."
I’m due to leave for Runaway Bay in 2 weeks. I am concerned but if I stopped for everything I’d never get anywhere. Realizing the severity of this virus I’m willing to chance it with precautionary measures.
"#96 this is kind of how I feel too. We have a trip planned to Beaches for May 9. We can cancel for full refund up to 31 days before (we'd have to get airline credit and eat the $1000 cancel/change fee). I think we'll wait another month and make a decision at the last moment we can get full cash refund for the resort. Who knows how this will look in a week, a month or 2 months."
We are headed to Treasure Beach April 5th. Traveling as a family with my husband and our 18 and 12 year old. Taking the necessary hygiene precautions. Not really worried about getting sick. More concerned that our plans would get cancelled than anything else. Jamaica soon come!
"Looks like Jamaica just added Spain, France and Germany to the restricted travel list."
"""Looks like Jamaica just added Spain, France and Germany to the restricted travel list.""They did that several days ago.Wonder what will happen to my German friends who go back to see family every summer....hopefully the ban will be lifted by then.Process? P4D seems a bit concerned about ""process"". I guess he didn't travel after 9/11 (I was on a plane a month later and in New York). Talk about change in procedure - changes we all take for granted as normal now. But it was a shock to the system then...air travel was never a joy but it became a downright PIA on September 12, 2001.Jamaica is doing a lot better in trying to keep the country virus-free than the US in just trying to mitigate the situation. I hope those that choose to travel to this wonderful place stay safe and healthy (boost your immune system, wash your hands etc., etc., etc.) and have a great vacation I'm sure you richly deserve!"
"Anybody have any recommendations for 3rd party travel insurance? We are supposed to leave for our Honeymoon April 20th, but I'm nervous to see what will happen in the next few weeks. Sandals told me it was too late to add theirs, since we made our last payment."
"Steve go to insuremytrip.com or your insurance agent to compare prices. I doubt any policy will cover coronavirus at this point, but you should still get it anyway for medical, lost luggage, etc."
We are travelling mid April through the first week in May. I am definately concerned about the airport and the plane the most. No plans to cancel our trip yet but watching day by day.
"My husband and I are in our 60s and have a trip to Montego Bay planned for the week of April 5th. As I understand it, if either one of us shows a fever on their monitors when we get off the plane, vacation’s over. We’re put in quarantine.Does anyone know what happens if someone gets a cold/ develops a fever while at a resort? What about when returning? Are we to again be screened before we get on the return flight? And kept in a Jamaican hospital for maybe several weeks? Or tested — if they have enough.I’m waffling back and forth on whether to cancel or not. I worry as much if not more about quarantine. Any ideas?"
"SueS I can't see Jamaica quarantining people who are entering or leaving the Country.Do you really think that Jamaica or any other country has the ability to quarantine plane loads of people?I think the media has blown this out of proportion, it's a virus.Yes it would be sad to get sick on vacation but you could get killed in a fatality on the way to the airport.You have to live your life and not be scared of ""what if"""

Your data presentation and conclusions you drew (if that was not simply a cut and paste without proper attribution, which I suspect it was) is misleading at best for those without good understanding of math and statistics. It reminds me of the famous: “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.”If you find the head of the WHO suspect or not expert enough, then I’m not sure what the source of your information is.

Kind of want do my part in stopping the spread.I got the full credit of my flight so I hope I can rebook very soon!"
"1 week from today (March 19) we are scheduled to arrive at SANDALS OCHI for our Wedding-Moon.(Philly --> Montego) I'm aware we're at the mercy of American Airlines and TSA however my question is more on the SANDALS RESORT Side. Is the resort at FULL CAPACITY for this time of year and/or are any of the restaurants, bars or excursions closed or impacted? I'm curious if couples have cancelled their March Vacations and if there is any information outside of the Sandals Statement at the link below that you can only find if you google https://www.sandals.com/coronavirus-info/Thanks All!"
"Crystal - Call Sandals directly. None of us can speak to their current occupancy. You will definitely be able to fly, Jamaica is still letting US planes land and so far the US is still letting flights from Jamaica land as well.Whether you cancel or not is up to you and your guests."
"We were supposed to travel Sunday to MoBay. We cancelled. Not worth the risk to us of being quaratined or getting it in our travels (whether for our health or those of my parents and grandparents we will see 1 week after we'd get back). Then when Germany was announced, we couldn't have gone anyway as my husband would be denied entry as he flew through Germany less than a week ago. We debated booking elsewhere in the states, then decided it's just best to stay home given the fluid situation. Our city just declared an emergency and no gatherings of 1,000 or more. Our kids are so sad, tough decision to make."
"Rastagirl777, have you been to Sandals Ochi recently (The Past Month)? My intent of the post is for someone to chime in that can confirm that all the resort offerings are still available to help with the dreaded cancellation decision.Thank you for the positive vibes, however ""definitely be able to fly"" ... I'm no so sure that will be the case 1 week from now but am extremely optimistic!!Thank you very much, Crystal"
Wildcat22.Thank you for your time and response. Be well. - Crystal
"I’ve just cancelled my vacation at Sandals Royal Caribbean for early April and rebooked it for mid November. Everything transferred over; we had bought the travel insurance. Given that we’re both over 60 and they’re really trying to contain the pandemic, it seemed wisest. Hopefully at least some issues will have improved by then. If not — well, we tried.It probably would have been safe to keep the April reservation, but I had the option to just delay it, so I did.Edited: 1:16 pm, March 12, 2020 "
All schools now on shut down for 14 days with effect from tomorrow. Also all entertainment places now have licences revoked to avoid large gatherings.
"I'm scheduled to leave April 7 -16th. As long as my flight holds, I think I'm still going. Just left my Dr.'s office and asked his thoughts. He is leaving for Nepal on April 2. Isn't changing his plans. He then pointed out this statistic:https:/…It does give you something to think about. In this digital age, all information (true, misguided or even lies) spread faster than any virus could. I mean does anyone remember interactive ESRI maps with big red dots all over it for the 2018/2019 flu season?I am taking normal flu precautions but trying not to buy into the mass hysteria either."
"<< ""trying not to buy into the mass hysteria either."" >>The problem is that -- whether you ""buy in"" or not -- at some point you'll be forced to DEAL with the hysteria. Even if it is unfounded. I bought two giant packs of toilet paper at the grocery store just a few minutes ago. They were the last two on the shelf. Don't necessarily need it right now.... but might in two weeks. Suppose there's none available when we DO need it?Edited: 3:50 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"I agree with RPJ-NJ. Whether the hysteria is founded or not, it exists and we have to deal with it.I am 30 and don't recall what having a fever even feels like... so I am not in the at-risk population. But like what if I am unwillingly spreading this stuff and not knowing it? That's kinda selfish. Also, the idea of being quarantined somewhere for any reason is a little daunting.I am coming to terms that while it was a difficult decision to cancel my March 19 to Montego Bay, it was the mature choice. Now I have to decide if I should rebook now for late in the year or wait till there is some clarity in the world...Edited: 5:13 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"""All schools now on shut down for 14 days with effect from tomorrow. Also all entertainment places now have licences revoked to avoid large gatherings.""And this is in a place where they have either 3 or 6 confirmed cases. Wish the US would get its act together on this thing once and for all.AND PLEASE STOP WITH THE TOILET PAPER! Geez people....hoarding toilet paper IS hysterical behavior....the supply chains for toilet paper are not affected, in fact the supply chains for ANYTHING is not affected at all even when the stuff comes fro China for Christ's sake!!!!! And if you see TWO packages on the shelf how about leaving ONE pack for someone else?And guess what - in the extreme unlikely case that the world runs out of toilet paper and none will be made again for the next six months......go old school - soap and water and a good ol' washcloth.Cripes. Can you tell I've had it up to ""here"" with all this nonsense?"
"Very well said. I was scheduled to leave 3 wks from today, and (regrettably) am deciding to cancel. The potential for future travel restrictions, and the risk of being stranded and unable to return as scheduled are my main concerns. That, and our own (employer) stipulations for international travel. Planning to rebook either for this summer or fall, once this stabilizes.Edited: 7:21 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Very well said, meaning ""I am coming to terms that while it was a difficult decision to cancel my March 19 to Montego Bay, it was the mature choice."""
"Yup, I can't wrap my head around the toilet paper panic. This virus is NOT gastro intestinal. If you catch this virus you will not spend the day sitting on the toilet going through rolls upon rolls of toilet paper."
COVID-19 may have GI symptoms since it infects cells there too.
"""COVID-19 may have GI symptoms since it infects cells there too.""I have not heard that AT ALL. This is a respiratory virus, not gastro."
"There’s 5 people in my family. We normally go through TP fast with everyone in school and work but if we have to quarantine, self imposed or not, it’s going to go extra fast. They’re closing schools here."
I leave for runaway bay on the 22nd. My concern is there being some form of travel restrictions while we are there and getting stuck there. How do you feel about that?
"GI symptoms are less common, but do occur. There are studies now exploring fecal transfer to explain them.https:/…Coronavirus_COVID_19__SARS_CoV_2_"
What's toilet paper???
"I leave to go to Runaway Bay on the 22nd as well and I have the same concern as you doEdited: 2:57 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Thank you for sharing that, Jeanne."
How is it now? I read in Reuters that 100 Cuban nurses have been called in.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…
This is a good response. We have to flatten the curve or the medical systems will be overwhelmed. This covid19 is extremely contagious.
"We are booked for riu negril, flying out March 22. I have't cancelled yet, but I think we will have to. I'm waiting til the last minute though. Thankfully I have the cancel for any reason insurance.Edited: 8:48 am, March 14, 2020 "
Are you still going? We are scheduled to go march 26th to runaway bay! just not sure what to do
selfish
"Our family decided it is not worth it to travel at this time. We are canceling for now. I get away for a break from real life, and if I will be worrying the whole time, then what is the point of going? Canada does not want people participating in any non-essential travel so we are going to comply. I've been dieting for the past month so it will be nice to eat some carbs again. lol"
TIMMAAY Why selfish?
"We decided to postpone and reschedule. We were scheduled to leave April 4th, We are not worried about getting sick as much as we were worried about being becoming carriers and transferring it others. We also thought about possible travel restrictions as this peaks. We rescheduled for mid June. Hopefully we are able to flatten the curve by then! Stay safe everyone."
"Krishelle,Those are great reasons. Friends in Italy said they were locked down because people wouldn’t self-quarantine. Everyone was coming up with personal definitions of “essential travel”. People were still going about their lives except for what was closed. Recommendations couldn’t be clearer now. Stay away from airports and airplanes. Asymptomatic transmission is easier than they thought. This starts to get better when people make decisions based on more than just themselves and their immediate families."
We are supposed to go to Negril April 3rd. We are hoping things may de-escalate by then. There are only 8 cases in Jamaican and none are near Negril. I am just wondering if Jamaica will put restrictions on US travelers now...
"<< ""April 3rd.... We are hoping things may de-escalate by then"" >>Like they did in Asia and Europe a few weeks ago?Oh, wait...People can make whatever decisions they want... but for goodness sake try to base your thinking on something approaching realism.One need only look at the time-course of the virus spread in the countries that are a few weeks ahead of where we are in North America and the Caribbean to understand that things here will not de-escalate by April 3rd."
The consensus of opinion here in the UK seems to be that cases - in the UK - will not peak until early to mid June.
Cancel. Cancel. Cancel. There is no other answer.
#155. Curious... whose opinion? Govt? Medicalcommunity? Can you clarify this?
"Yes, the UK might not peak until June.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…"
Some predictions for US show the peak later in the summer ...https:/…coronavirus-trump-response.htmlBut most people won't be infected yet and it'll still be concerning. It remains to be seen how various countries will deal with travel in that case.
Jeri B. I am monitoring the same thing in regards if they will put a ban for US travelers. I am going on March 26.
you mean you HOPE you're going on march 26th.
It doesn't affect them as much but they can transmit it to others! Your kids could kill someone's grandma.
Have insurance tough to get your money back
Anyone worried about influenza B?
"We have already canceled but our airline announced yesterday they are not flying anyone onto the island, only bringing people back. I cannot wait to rebook, praying a successful vaccine is created soon!Edited: 8:36 am, March 17, 2020 "
Fixatia - there will not be a vaccine for another 12-18 months. Right now it's all about keeping as many people as healthy as possible.
"I just want to make a comment about TP and all the comments that there are no GI issues related to COVID. There are people who have other conditions that they live with before covid and after covid such as chrons, colitis and ibs. And, these conditions are oftentimes triggered when they are ill or under stress (even though the illness itself may have no GI symtoms). This is a reality in my household. So, although I do think the videos I have seen of people with 6 or 7 24 packs in their cart are ridiculous, before you judge those purchasing a couple of packs instead of one, perhaps think that their reality might be a bit different than yours."
Last I heard the production of toilet paper has not stopped. This means you will be able to get it in the store soon - as long as the hysterical people don't empty the shelves first.Meantime - a wet washcloth does the trick.
"I would strongly suggest checking with your resort before going to the airport. We were scheduled to leave last Saturday and decided not to go. My family arrived last Thursday and have been told they need to leave the resort by Saturday March 21. The hotel website states they are closed until May 1. Many of the tourist attractions such as Dunns River are closed, bars and clubs as well. Many of the resorts are also closing. The country also has put restrictions in place. Please check. You may have to dig pretty deep to find details. Airlines are allowing travelers to cancel and rebook tickets at a later datejamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20200317/du…"
