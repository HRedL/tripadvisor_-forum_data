"We spend our winters in PV and we have been there over 30 times, but we are so confused as to whether we should go this year or not. We’ve kinda decided to go to PV for January February and March, but we are going to spend an extra $1500 and purchase health insurance in Mexico that covers COVID-19. We can’t bear the idea of staying in the cold, frigid Illinois winter, we just have to go somewhere warm. If we didn’t go to Mexico, we would probably have to go to Florida, Arizona, or Texas and COVID-19 is running rampant in those areas. I think we are safer in PV then in the United States. We know PV will not be the same place as in past years, and we know there will be many restrictions due to COVID-19, but we can’t bear the thought of not seeing our friends, visiting our favorite restaurants, and enjoying the beaches of PV. Are we nuts to go to PV this winter? What are your thoughts?"
"I will be honest, since you asked for an opinion. Yes I think you are nuts to go anywhere in Mexico or any southern state. We are not going to Mexico, in fact I cancelled my year round health ins. with MasterCard just today. We normally go in Feb. but not this time. My life is more important than any holiday anywhere. I cant imagine getting on an airplane to anywhere.i live in Ontario, Canada so I understand winter. I'd rather be here where I feel safe."
"I was just talking to my girlfriend last night. We are planning on a girls trip for Day of the Dead. (Also going the end of December with my husband). We decided we do not want to be out of the US and get C-19. The hospitals could be full to capacity down there. We have insurance for Covid as well- only cost us $60 for both. Yes, for sure it covers it if we get sick while there. BUT- we are more worried about the hospital count. There may be no room or supplies if you need a respirator. That’s the clincher for us. She wants to cancel right now but I just can’t push the button. I still have a glimmer of hope perhaps that’s because I have a great cancellation policy so I’m not worried about that.Edited: 1:03 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Cases are skyrocketing here and will peak September to December, just be cautious and pay attention to news outlets in Mexico and FB groups and here on trip advisor of course!"
"#2 DeanaJMO but I think you should push the button,. October isn’t that far away and I don’t think the situation will be much different then it is right now.. Maybe October 2021?"
"I live in Arizona, a Covid hotspot, and don’t personally know anyone here who has tested positive for the virus. But I have two acquaintances in Vallarta who got the virus and one passed away last weekend."
I would not go anywhere in that time frame that required a trip on an airplane. That's the clincher for us. And as of last week we do have family members (in a different state - Nebraska) that have gotten the corona virus.
"""Things I'm wondering about...  - Did you feel ""on guard"" a lot? - Were you truly relaxed ( pre alcohol LOL ) even while maintaining protocol? - Did you find yourself wondering what that waiter or staff member is doing in his or her life outside of the restaurant or your accommodations? - Were you nervous about going into your room after the maid had been there? - Were you relieved when 2 weeks back at home had passed without covid symptoms?""you need to change the verb tense to the future like ""will you""i hope kansas doesn't mind i stole this from another post that she started. except for the 2nd question---if you answered yes to the others----i would really sit down and think about it--really think. especially as the time gets closer and things have not changed.kevin ---who lives there--is giving us what it's like in pv now. myself i wouldn't want to be there until things improve--which may not happen with the maskless wonders and the close talkers."
"That's ok Iyam! :)Ed, I would not feel safer in PV than at home *right now. The reason is masks have been mandated here and almost every single person is complying. People in PV aren't complying at that rate. So I personally think I'm better off here. Having said that, who knows what will happen between now and the end of this year, or into next year. I can keep my reservations without penalty, so that's what I'm doing. It's no problem for me personally, so anybody who has that kind of situation, there is no harm in hanging onto them longer."
"Yup!!! You are nuts!!! I too miss my friends,beaches etc. but I do not want to be even run the risk of being responsible for their deaths. Way too many people are only thinking “ I need or want” everyone needs to start thinking in the context of “we”, since WE are all in this together and only WE can get things under control. Sit back and ask yourself “ What collective good do I do by wanting to get away from the cold? “Does your insurance cover anyone else? Highly doubt it! But in the end it is your decision and your level of comfort putting others at risk at home or abroad.I know where my level is and am staying home (in the cold) hoping others come to realization that the sacrifices made now pay dividends sooner rather than later. I apologize for the rant but I am getting pretty tired of staying home because others can’t realize they should too!"
"I guess that I am totally nuts as well. I still plan to go 1 November. I can skip Covid19 here. I can skip Covid19 in PV. I can catch covid19 here, I can catch covid19 in PV. I just plan to be careful wherever I am."
"For those truly feel it's a error to visit PV anytime in the next 7 mos (which is the timeframe provided by Ed), I have a sincere question. I posted this last night in the Cancun forum, so I'm going to copy/paste here. Keep in mind, this was geared more towards the AI experience, which is probably less common in PV than in CUN (or NV, for that matter). But if staying nearly 100% on an AI versus being out-and-about has a material impact to your answer, please share. Pasted from Cancun:I have a sincere question. This is not a trap or a trick of any sort. My question is this: If it’s not a good time to come to Mexico [in the next 7 mos], when is a good time?I presume that you are waiting for:A/ Effective vaccine?B/ Effective treatment?C/ Decline in cases/deaths vs growth like we’re seeing now?D/ Green traffic light?E/ Other data or milestone?F/ Some combination?My top-of-mind thought is that safe, truly responsible travel is good for both vacationers and for local workers. But I am genuinely interested in your thoughts here."
"Hola from poolside in sunny hot & humid PV.Just my opinion. If you said you were coming October, November and December I would say you're Nuts!! January not quite right in the head, February just a little crazy .March just a tad confused.  If I was back in Canada right now I would be booking for January with medical insurance and good cancelation policies . Then I would wait and see how November and December pan out here . Then go what You feel comfortable with. I liked what someone above said. I can catch at home or I can catch it in PV That's true. My conclusion for you would be room at the hospital's here.im hearing stuff but not confirmed. Just found out the wife, of an owner of a popular tourist bar here has C19. Thankfully in recovery mode. I was out this morning and mask wearing is just a little less than 50%.  I don't have anything more to add at this time. Stay safe"
Sorry for my typos above. Writing on a small phone with sun on you ain't easy. My concern would be hospital's and room.
"‘I can catch at home or I can catch it in PV’ but you’re chances are also greater, increasing your risk — airport, flying and going to a Coronavirus hot spot no less! Totally nuts or beyond frustration."
"I think the point is NOT whether you will be safer in PV than in the US - but rather- are you posing a risk to others, since you are coming from a country that has the most infections worldwide. Need to maybe think of others first. I'm cancelling my planned trip for end of October - because I don't want to be somewhere where there are a lot of Americans."
"Thanks for your realistic view Kevin. We booked a trip to PV way back in Feb. when this was just a blip on the radar. It's fully cancellable, so we have decided to cancel because we usually go to the Velas at the Marina but this time we booked at Playa Los Arcos - so right downtown - seems precarious. Just not worth it - we've been going for 20 years and we can take a pass for this year. I was there in January, then Cozumel in Feb so I'm good with hanging our here in Canada for a while. Cheers and stay safe"
"Hello. It’s very hard to tell what will happen by then but if you read Puerto Vallarta News Daily it appears to be very serious there now. The beautiful people who live there, work so hard have no source of income if they don’t work. Multi generation living also makes it difficult for them during Covid. We live in Canada, it’s freezing here in the winter but I can’t imagine going to PV and not being able to go out to a bar Or restaurant . These are extremely difficult times. Make sure you get a good cancellation clause with your rental ."
"Totally agree with others. Totally NUTS for going this fall, and as Kevin says,Crazy in the Head into the New Year..JNS Great comment. ."
"You asked for thoughts... And I'm staying home.I canceled PV back in March sadly, my usual spring trip, yes I've also been 30+ times. And I am not even thinking about rebooking any travel anywhere until spring/summer 2021. But I am not a snowbird, don't have 3 months I could be away. For me the stress and uncertainties of traveling at this time is simply not worth it. The closures and limitations in Vallarta are nothing I need to experience.I strongly do not agree with your opinion that you are safer in Mexico than in the US as far as the numbers and the 'curve' for the pandemic."
"I have an October 13th reservation from Sacramento to Phoenix to PVR which I feel compelled to keep. Since the pandemic hit I have flown on three commercial flights, and I have felt perfectly safe on each, though wearing a mask gets boring. I am good with flying, but I have concerns about returning to PV. I do not have a car in PV, and I MUST get a commercial photograph; I MUST go inside a specific bank to pay a fee; and I MUST also go to immigration, probably on two different days. I have a safe place to live with books, CD's, and many divertive electrical toys. My freezer, in my double door refrigerator, is packed with vegan goodies, but I will have to go out for produce. I would like to stay for Day of the Dead and the Guadalupe processions. There is a wedding planned in Qaxaca during December I would like to attend. By all means, if you come to Mexico just to play and hang out, stay home until you feel safe. But life must endure."
"It's not about me feeling safe. I'm not sure why that is so hard for people to understand. I don't want the hassle of traveling when I have to wear a mask, social distance, find none of the things I like to do in PV after arrival with all the closures and cancellations. And I'm only a short-timer with only a few weeks vacation.If you are a retired snowbird and have 3-6 months available and a nice apartment to live in, aren't really into going out and about... that is a different set of circumstances.But I still believe in my heart anyone traveling for non-essential reasons in 2020 is ""nuts"" in the big picture."
"It is not just Covid, it is safety right now. There is a lot going on in Vallarta these days. I am sure some of you will think this is fear-mongering, but I do think tourists should be aware. Times are tough. This was out by Costco.Mass kidnapping suffered in VallartaThe North / StaffMexico City (July 25, 2020) .-05:00 hrsKidnappings are now en masse. About 20 young people who were making an adventure trip in off-road vehicles through the Sierra Occidental of Jalisco were plagiarized last Saturday by armed men when they arrived in Puerto Vallarta.Among the victims, originating from Guanajuato, there are at least 10 small businessmen, close sources said.According to the versions, there is one dead after the attack. How many remain kidnapped is unknown.""This type of circumstance had not happened and the fact that something like this has happened in a group of young people, young entrepreneurs who were not going to do anything other than have fun, vacation, ride a motorcycle, causes you concern,"" he told Grupo REFORMA. , via telephone, a businessman from Guanajuato who requested anonymity for security.The sources reported that the group of travelers had been located by the criminals, alleged members of the Jalisco Nueva Generación Cartel (CJNG), during the course of their adventure tourism tour, known as ""Vallartazo"".The tour begins in Guadalajara and passes through Ameca and Talpa de Allende to reach Puerto Vallarta.It was on July 18 when the criminals caught up with the caravan, as it was arriving at the tourist port.One of the versions indicates that those who intercepted the youths suspected that it was a group from the rival cartel Santa Rosa de Lima, which is leading ""El Marro"".According to various testimonies, those affected were traveling in RZR-type vehicles, ATVs, and SUVs when they were intercepted in Vallarta by the armed group on Avenida Fluvial, near the intersection with Avenida Grandes Lagos, in Fraccionamiento Fluvial Vallarta.After a shooting, several of the people in the tourist convoy were allegedly plagiarized.In the place, the businessman Joaquín Alba, dedicated to the transport of construction materials, was wounded, who allegedly was hit when he fell from one of the RZRs. Then he died in a hospital.After the attack, municipal authorities located three vehicles that apparently belonged to the victims. The City Council, however, denied that there was an ""uprising"".Another source close to the case said that the attackers began calling the victims' families to ask for money for their ransom.Until yesterday there was no official confirmation of the events and it was unknown how many people were still being held."
"Post #15, not that long ago I was called a racist, or similar for saying the same thing. Didn't want to travel where alot of Americans are traveling, as they are the hot spot of the world right now. Totally agree with you though. January is still a wait and see in my books, They are predicting a peak in September, so if that happens and the cases fall by Nov/ Dec then Jan may be doable."
We are like post #21We don't want all the hassles of having to follow all the different guidelines. We are fortunate to have the ocean within a 20 minute drive. Stay safe all.
"George, I did read not long ago about several similar kidnappings elsewhere in Mexico. I can't remember, but seemed like they were not far from Guadalajara. They did recover some of the kidnapped people though, alive."
"We are hoping these kids are found alive. This is being kept quiet around Vallarta. Fear is real here, not just Covid. Kidnappings have become much more bold. There is a lot going on in this country right now, people should read more. This happened at a very busy intersection near Costco in Vallarta. True it may be nothing to do with tourists, but similar to Chicago situations, innocent lives can be taken. Please people, be aware of what goes on around you."
"My husband read somewhere that if you got Covid-19 in Mexico and were sent to the hospital, your survival rate of recovering is 50/50. Odds of surviving are much, much better in the U.S. We were also planning on spending a large part of winter in Puerto Vallarta. We decided against it because even if you purchase insurance the price for a hospital stay because of COVID-19, your odds of recovery aren’t good. Also we spoke to a restaurant owner in Puerto Vallarta. He told us, as much as he would like to see us ...... and as much as needing business right now, he told us to stay home because it wasn’t good down there."
"We had planned to visit PV for the first time in October. Have travelled extensively globally for many years, but never to PV, and friends recommend it. To say I’m having second thoughts is an understatement. It’s not that I think it’s less safe than here in Santa Fe, it’s more of a reluctance to travel at all at this time. Going through airports, flying for hours wearing face coverings, getting to a wonderful destination where the normal exuberance and open experiences are shrouded by a vague fear of an invisible enemy. I think we’ll pass for now."
"I trust what Kevin says about this.I hear you JackEdited: 10:06 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"We were out yesterday at El Rio. Lovely time. De-stressed as it is a strain right now. The day got spoilt when we later found out our friend who was admitted to hospital Friday with C19 passed away yesterday. Brings it home as being Real. Two months ago it felt like a bad dream, now it feels like a horrid nightmare. We have heard the hospitals are a mess but that had not been confirmed. Let's see what today brings. Stay safe and don't travel to PV or Mexico in the near future. K."
"Yes, totally nuts"
"El Rio is where you would find me Kevin, if I was in PV. I hope they stay open this summer as long as possible. But, I'm sorry to hear your friend succumbed to covid19. : ("
"We are scheduled to arrive on October 29th. I imagine that this trip will be different than previous visits to Vallarta. I'm wearing masks, social distancing, and spending a lot more time at home. We may end up spending our trip semi-isolating at Lindo Mar just as we are doing here."
Spot. Lindo Mar is a place where my wife and I feel safe eating and drinking. Waiteriare wearing a mask and a visor. Lots of open space. Stay safe
"I could spend my time self-isolating at Lindo Mar if, I could teleport there.:)"
"^^^I wouldn't bet the farm on that Kansas. I'm afraid we'll see more pandemics rather than fewer. And, we can only hope we'll be better prepared for the next one. Am I betting on that? I am not? Apparently, as a people we have forgotten how to unite to defeat an enemy. Requires leadership which is totally missing."
"Ed I don’t think you’re nuts , even with the situation like it is now people are are going, by December I’m hoping it’ll improve and as long as it’s not worse and is on it’s on its way down, I’ll be going for my 4 months, end of November to the end of March , I’ve been about 25 times at first the east coast then PV and have friends there both local and vacationers , I will also spend extra on Covid insurance and will follow all rules that I have to , masks, sanitizer, social distancing etc, stay safe."
"Long time barman at Que Pasa has C19. As I've said before. It's going to get way worse before it gets better. Still less than 50% of the people wearing masks. Probably way less than that out in the burbs... Pitiall, Ixtapa. Those areas are where most of your staff at hotels, condos and restaurants travel from on the C19 bus. This is not a warning. This is your update. Stay safe."
Thanks Kevin for reporting with your flip flops on the ground...very authentic. We will wait until late December to decide about our usual 3-4 month trip. Most people I see here in Northern Virginia are wearing masks & distancing but always those few who don't care! I have a cousin in California (health worker) and a friend in Georgia (apartment complex agent) who have it now. Also my next door neighbor had it & has recovered. They all are mid aged. We use public transportation in PV and rent a 2 bedroom south beach condo. Here we have our own car to feel safe in and a 3 level house with big yard so why take a chance...even with having that awesome ocean to look at every day! Definitely will be a tough decision for many people!
"MarvinPV.....i see you are also Canadian like myself. We cannot even purchase travel insurance for Covid coverage with any Insurance companies like Pacific Blue Cross, Green Shield, Manulife, and etc. They will only cover us for emergencies but NOT related to Covid illnesses. It is good you are able to purchase extra travel insurance for Covid coverage because we certainly are not able to get any Covid coverage. This would be the only reason why we won't go to PV in January for a month because we can't afford to take the risk of no Covid coverage."
Just in case any of you are wondering we have full medical insurance here. Includes C19 coverage. Hopefully Never to be used.
"Fred unfortunately we don’t have a nationwide plan here in the US, actually there is still NO PLAN AT ALL!! As I said in a previous post it’s been long past due to shut the Country (US) down and start from square one with a clean slate. As my family in Italy reminds me, Americans don’t want to be inconvenienced and lack consideration for how their actions may affect others, they think for themselves and the moment with no responsibility for their actions — and so the virus continues! WE ARE NOT (as Americans) ALL in this together.Edited: 4:43 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"Cliu, once the non essential travel advisory is lifted, Manulife is covering covid. There are also two Canadian companies covering covid right now, but I can't think of their names off hand. I'll try and find and post back.JNS. I have no idea why more countries (including Mexico) are not just banning Americans from entering and forcing a country wide lockdown until the USA can get this under control. I feel for you guys, but I don't want to travel anywhere where Americans are allowed right now. And this is not racist! It's just kind of a sad fact of where you guys are now."
"Cliu, it's Medical Travel Insurance and Blue Cross offering covid coverage now."
"The US is indeed having a terrible time getting this under control. To me, the major concern is the death count as this disease is foremost a ""deadly"" disease. Other flu strains have far greater case counts, but fewer deaths.Then you should look at deaths per 1 million population to see how successfully countries are in preventing deaths. When you do that you see that while the US still has a very big problem, several other countries are doing worse.The US as of today has 452 deaths per 1 million population, Peru 546 per 1M, Chili 476 per 1M, Spain 608 per 1M, UK 674 per 1M, Italy 581 per 1M, France 462 per 1M, Sweden 564 per 1M, Belgium 847 per 1M... I would not blame any country from closing down US travel, but it would be short-sighted to not do the same for the other countries with such a high density death count."
China among the lowest in the world - only 3.34 deaths per million. Need to jump on the Zhuhai forum.
"Honestly, for the OP's dates, I do think it is too soon to tell. The kidnapping post really has nothing to do with Covid safety. I am going to withhold comments on travel before next year for right now but just say I do believe Jalisco will get worse before it gets better. JNS..you live in Connecticut which along with Massachusetts, New York and some other states are now considered low risk states, be proud of that as opposed to the rest of the country."
"Sunlover, maybe it’s just a typo on your part, the company besides blue cross that is covering now, is actually called Medipac Travel Insurance, lol, and cliu as sunlover says manulife and some others will be covering COVID once the non essential travel advisory is lifted including BCAA who l usually get my travel insurance with on a yearly basis which you do save money on in total if do buy by the year."
"Cliu , I think I should also add that the one company that has COVID coverage now is called Canadian Association of Blue Cross which I’m assuming Pacific Blue Cross is part of ."
"Oops, yes, thank you fro the correction.lol."

The only solution is to shut down completely and fine people for not wearing masks.Nothing short of this will work.I am appalled at the lack of enforcement. I'm not going back until Puerto Vallarta gets its act together; maybe never.The city's response has been lackluster at best.The key to economic restoration is defeating the virus.
"I am proud that we live in one of the low risk states and optimistic things will stay that way with the 2 week quarantine in place for out of states visitors and fines if not followed. It does make it easier getting up in the morning for work, and a sense of relief that my sisters (both nurses) are no longer going into hospitals at increased capacity and risk; a lot of residents here commute to and from New York City, hopefully they’ll keep their numbers low as well. Unfortunately even here not everyone’s following the guidelines, and stores and business that arent making masks mandatory we are just not going to any longer. Sadly we recently lost one of my cousins (58yo) from Arizona. Although most of my family lives here, some live in other states and are suffering the misfortune of how badly things are being managed elsewhere.Edited: 10:56 pm, July 26, 2020 "
Reyes has lost his fight. This is awful.
"RE#59 - I think as far as guidelines go, they were/are good. The problem has been that the Governor has downloaded all the responsibilities for monitoring the guidelines to the local governments. The Mayor has just recently indicated that they have limited resources to enforce any of the guidelines. So as more and more businesses open, nobody is really checking them. The limited number of authorities are focused on more touristy areas and it seems to more of a ""keeping up appearances"" approach. As soon as you travel out of the tourist zones, things are quite a bit different. When the Mayor announced that they didn't have the resources to hand out fines to people not wearing masks, the masks started to drop to people's chins again. Currently, projections are that the virus will peak here in Vallarta mid-September, around Independence day.The Governor posted updated numbers today regarding a possible lockdown of all but the most essential of services. The numbers are getting really close to those required to start a 14 day lockdown. If the numbers stay on trend, the lockdown will start within the next two weeks. Newspapers today are indicating that it's inevitable."
I have to agree. Lockdown needs to be for a long period. Two weeks will achieve nothing.So very sad what is happening in PV.I for sure won't be spending the winter there this year.
"While I agree that a longer lockdown would have better results, it is my opinion that the 14 day lockdown is a type of punishment for people not following guidelines. The Governor has repeatedly indicated that it is up to the people to stop the lockdown. He has insisted that the government has taught the people how to cope with the virus and it will be their/our fault if things close down again. The old, ""I told you and you didn't listen"" approach to politics. It seems like such a childish response but it is clear based on many speeches that the blame for anything ""bad"" that happens will be placed on people and not the government."
""" I'm not good at articulating. You read my heart."" Kevin, anyone how could write this is very good at articulating. You & GenXpat touched my heart, too."
Thanks Cindy. Quick update Reyes the barman at Que Pasa passed away yesterday. Damn C19.. This was a tough weekend. Numbers also up again. The lockdown button should get pushed later this week. Stay safe.
"From those of you on the ground in PV, why do you assume a lockdown in the next week? It doesnt look like the self imposed guidelines of 400/million and 50% hospital utilization will get hit for another couple weeks (if it keeps rising)"
"Ben #68, I responded to your other comment in another thread as well. The lockdown is contingent on one or the other guidelines being met. Not both at the same time. The number of infections is nearing 400/million weekly."
I was to go this Thursday an American Airlines canceled all flights due to travel ban an it’s going to get worse come winter
"sharon, what route did american airlines close?"
AA cancelled all DFW NS to PVR.
"Yes, you're nuts. Your chances of dying, getting sick ""of"" COVID is virtually zero. Do the math. I just returned from Guadalajara, (yesterday actually), and am looking to go to PVR next week. Have no qualms about travelling / taking advantage of the cheap flights / hotel rooms."
"^^^I'm sure a lot of those 150000 dead folks in the US thought the chances of them getting COVID was virtually zero, too."
"Nah.. Over a million people have died in the US since March. Some of them tested happened to test positive for Covid. Very, very few died of Covid because it was the underlying cause. No doubt it caused a few excess deaths in the short term BUT, in the UK right now the average number of daily deaths is actually below the historical norm. I suspect the same is true in other countries (haven't bothered to google whether it's the case or not). Wonder why that is ????"
i wonder what that cat is smokin--lol

"I guess, if you’re in denial, the 14 day quarantine period following international travel, doesn’t apply to you. Guadalajara this week, PV next week. Unwitting carriers of this non-existent disease should line up behind Robert. Until people and countries start taking this pandemic seriously, the virus will continue to win.Edited: 8:38 am, July 28, 2020 "
"No, not in denial. Just able to use a calculator. Divide a very small number (people dying “of” Covid)by a very large number, (population). Result is lots of zeros and then a number. This is your very crude chance of dying from it. If you’re < 65 with no appreciable heath issues chances are even less. If > 65 with health issues chances are higher. It’s a problem - the vulnerable need to be very careful but for the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of the population it’s a complete non issue."
"The vast, vast, vast, vast majority of the population that are asymptomatic or presymptomatic should be smart enough to protect the vulnerable among us (whether >65 or <65) by self isolating or self quarantining (at the very least) after travelling. Why anyone would wantonly continue the spread is beyond selfish."
"Wrong again, We have to be rational about this, take politics/fear out of it and look at the science, the data, info on demographics, co morbidities, natural normal death rate and so on. Also we should not ignore that if Covid is listed AT ALL on the death certifcate then Medicare reimbursement is increased by 20 %. Right now, in Orange County CA at least, virutally everyone admitted to hospital is tested for COVID - even those in the trauma unit. There is also zero issue with Hospital capacity.Yes, there are some excess deaths and deaths that are accelerated, (borrowed from the near future) - the data supports this - but not to the extent we're asked to believe. If you're old and/or vulnerable be careful. If not then nothing to worry about."
"We can't stop people from travelling, going to work, going to school, going about their lives. It is going to spread, you can not put the toothpaste back in the tube. We've had, and will continue to have, excess deaths but we have to act proportionatly and look at a bigger picture / other consequences.. Things we don't immedialty think about like the huge increase in serious child abuse since they closed the schools down.. You have to look at the data/science, not politics/fear. We have enough good quality, reliable data from Western Europe, US to be able to figure a lot more out than we could 2-3 months ago.."
# 82. This isn't data. It's cut and paste from a media repost.
"We're planning to head down for our usual 6-8 weeks over the Dec / Jan timeframe. Having said that, our circumstances differ from those of most tourists. We'll be staying at a condo in a low density development that's located right on the beach in the Nuevo area. The development has tight protocols in place that are enforced. Once there we will keep a very low profile - minimal trips outside the development, having groceries delivered, etc. No bars, minimal restaurants. Most of our days will be spent on the balcony or, assuming it's open, down at the beach, which is very low density relative to, say, Los Muertos. We spend a lot of time on the water - kayaking, paddleboarding, etc. - which is the ultimate in social distancing. That's how we managed things when we were there in March, and though far from ideal it was the right thing to do while we were working to organize a return flight. I realize it sounds far too boring to those who like to spend their vacation time exploring and hanging out at bars & restaurants. We like to do that too, but we've accepted that things need to be done differently for the foreseeable future. It's not the way we would normally choose to spend our time in the Vallarta area, but it's an approach we're comfortable with and the risk - both to us and from us - will be minimal. The main issue will be getting there safely. We're fortunate to live in a city where there are many non-stop flights to choose from, so no connections required. The international airport here is new, and sparsely populated even during normal times. The carriers all operate modern equipment, which have hospital-quality HEPA filtration systems and contrary to the planes of old, are not flying petri dishes. We can handle wearing N95 masks for 7-8 hours. In the event flights aren't running by December, and assuming that means land borders are still closed so we couldn't drive, then I guess we'd experience our first white Christmas in 12 years."
"# 86 IIt is interesting and possibly factually correct but it's not data. It means very little quantitativelyThis is data: https:/…coronavirus-in-ocYesterday for example there were 2 deaths (yes two) of people in OC that tested positive for COVID. OC has the population of a small counrty. Every single person in OC admitted to hospital is tested for COVID. Every single person that dies in hospital has had a COVID test. This is real data that shows that statistically the chances of dying ""from"" it are essentially zero. Take a look at the mortality rates on the Social Security web page, (more data) - it might be a little worrying to the elderly amongst us to see that the chances of us dying increases quite a bit each year and are not insignificant.Get out and travel.Edited: 12:03 pm, July 28, 2020 "
"# 86.The point is data can't be skewed by an agenda. Or it is not supposed to be. If you know how to read a simple study, interprete some simple numbers, graphs etc. There are dozesn of studies out there now. Read them, as far as I can see (I may be wrong) they all come to the same conclusion.Now - a media report. That is a very different story. It's all political BS."
"Ot Bound, we are kind of the same boat, could isolate in our own condo( small complex) as well as our house here. I think the deciding factor for us, will be if we can get Medical coverage or not. If there is still a travel ban, ie borders closed, then this is not likely. We usually go Nov thru April. Hoping for at least Jan to April this season."
"{#79 - but for the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of the population it’s a complete non issue.}Good to know! All this fuss over nothing!!"
"# 91.What the ""data' says right now is mainly about hospitalization rates, ICU admission rates, incubation intervention rates, response to treatment rates and so on. I believe, I may be wrong, that this data clearly also shows what I've stated.There is of course no data on the long term effects but what your describing goes actually against all the medical data we have (it's usually asymptomatic, usually mild, etc etc.). There are always outliers and documented cases that the media love to jump on, (political reasons usually). The other one was the Kawasaki syndrome hysteria. Again statistically so insignificant I can barely believe I even mentioned it."
"Robert I think your hysteria and uncontrollable emotion one would have to ask ‘are you totally nuts???? This is a global pandemic, not a ‘hoax’ nor political agenda — 16,766,818+ cases and 659,814+ deaths worldwide and counting. It’s people that think like you that we all want to stay home!!"
"Hi JNSgrahic.We're all allowed our own opinions. Including you. I've stated more than once that I might not be correct and that my opinions are based what I perceive as data, not headlines, or the crude numbers you cite. The opinions of the posters that don't agree with me are actually reasonable. I can see why people would have them. They're not in left field, they're not loopy. What I've not done is characterize someone as having hysteria or accused anyone of having uncontrollable emotions, unlike you, just because they're not in agreement with you.I think you should travel more. It would broaden your horizons, make you more tolerant of differing opinions."
"#96.. Just to point out, you may not die of COVID instead you may live with debilitating side effects left behind. I get what you are saying on funding for Covid deaths but in Mexico it is the opposite. People do not want Covid on that death certificate as they want funerals, so on. They are paying what are called ( interesting to me) cayotes to get a Covid free death certificate so they can take their family members body. Good luck with your statistical thought process. Looking for afar, Ca. looks like a hot bed to me. The 2 week lockdown in Jalisco if it happens is to hopefully by means of punishment, show the people how they did not listen, people continued to get infected so now you will see what no work, no play means and hopefully in 2 weeks, people will comply with mandates."
"""659,814+ deaths worldwide and counting""Meanwhile, 60,000,000 people die globally in a typical year, which means roughly 25,000,000 people would have died over the past 5 months. Although the above figures may be factual, their meaning will be viewed differently depending on a person's biases & filters. Some will say that a single life lost to covid is one too many, while others will opine that it isn't worth the collateral damage associated with imploding the global economy to save a million or two out of a global population of nearly 8 billion. Like religion, politics, abortion etc., it's pointless arguing about these types of things in a forum such as this because the majority of people have already made their minds made up and will not be swayed."
"Robert,I like to read differing opinions. I think you raise some interesting questions about just what is the true mortality rate and the severity of current cases in the US. It's definitely counter to the prevailing popular consensus - but that alone does not put one in the wrong.OP asked if traveling in early-2021 is ""totally nuts"". Robert has made an interesting case that perhaps: a) traveling to a hot spot like PV might be OK, if you can tolerate the risk (e.g., your demographic / health situation allows it); and b) COVID-19 not as deadly as we are being led to believe. It's certainly a different perspective. Jury is out for me. Others may agree to disagree, but I don't see the value in immediately shutting it down. Remember: Minds are like parachutes - they work best when OPEN.I do want to be sensitive to the fact that if you have lost a loved one to the virus, your reaction is going to be much more personal than high-level stats or data. Perhaps a case where macro level data/trends paint one picture, but on a micro/personal level, it's a much different story. Ultimately, it's up to the OP if they can tolerate the risk (assuming it doesn't get better in 5-7 mos), and if they are willing to follow local protocols and guidance from world health leaders to travel responsibly. If a solution can be found that is acceptable to the OP, then it is not totally nuts to visit - unless something radically changes for the worse."
"BUT people are not just deciding on taking the risk for themselves only, when they can spread the virus to others that may have chosen not to take that risk."
"Robert, you’ve got your PV trip next week all figured out? Not a big deal then if you’re there when there’s a border / flights shutdown. Don’t worry, your hotel will bend over backwards to accommodate you. Medical insurance is not an issue for someone that doesn’t get sick. Even if bars and restaurants are closed, I don’t see an issue for a resourceful know-it-all. And quarantining between trips? Pfft!! For losers only, right? And since you refuse to transmit the virus to more vulnerable people, that should also be a nonissue, right?"
"That is true , and a part of the problem, that majority has no clue how to read and interpret a data ( even readily available) Per CDC data, Percent of expected deaths (which is the number of deaths for ALL causes for given time in 2020 compared to the average number across the same time in 2017–2019) that number is about the same in 2020 up to now. Also, that is true, that hospitals are paid highly increased fees for having “ Covid 19” put as a cause on d.certificates. If a patient died from a heart attack, for example, ( or natural death) and happened to be tasted positive for covid, the cause written, will be - covid. Even “ presumable “ covid still counts as covid.Edited: 3:07 pm, July 28, 2020 "
{b) COVID-19 not as deadly as we are being led to believe... Minds are like parachutes - they work best when OPEN.}Yes you are correct I will agree to disagree with that statement. I am not open minded about the pandemic being deadly and important to consider in your future actions.
#101 you are throwing factually inaccurate info out. There is zero talk of airports being shut down (it’s essential). Stop spreading mass hysteria.
"# 101I don't understand why you're getting personal just because we have differing opinions.My main concern IS actually whether the bars and restaurants are open. There won't be a border shut down for US Citizens wishing to return, (can't think of one ever except 9/11) nor will flights stop. My family and I were in the UK for 4 /5 weeks in March/April at the height of it all and had no issues going about our business, booking flights, getting home. I also don't see any reason to quarantine between trips for 2 weeks. I've also stated that vulnerable people need to be careful with this and limit their interaction with people. It is their choice whether they do this. As one poster mentioned the debate is whether the economic damage we're causing, the disruption to life, the multitude on negative knock on effects are ""worth"" what the data , IMHO, overwhelmingly suggests is going to save very few excess deaths.Anyway -- the point of this thread was to solicit opinions on whether we, as a forum, thought it safe to travel to PV. I've made my opinion clear, as have others. I'm not here to change peoples minds, nor insult someone that disagrees with me."
Read # 101 again carefully. Is he so intelligent that he is far over your heads with what he is saying? i detect a few sarcastic comments in the post . I believe he is far above most in this thread.
"{My main concern IS actually whether the bars and restaurants are open.} Well there you have it! Personal priorities and all. For me that would not be the ""main concern"" for going to Vallarta right now."
"Suze - Fair enough, I appreciate your perspective. Our views evolve over time as we learn more. I find it's generally good to read opposite perspectives not just ones that I agree with on the surface - otherwise, how can I honestly assess, analyze, and dismiss? As time passes and we learn more about the true mortality rate, I expect we can make more and more informed decisions in assessing our personal risk levels, and risk to others."
"Read Vallarta Daily covid updates - the rates are rising & Jalisco (of which PV is a part) could close down any day now - then again, it could stay open. i know, not very helpful but things change from day to day. and not that it matters, but i live down here. many places just opened, many are closed. i dont think ""just bars"" are allowed to be open."
"# 110I can't be 100 % sure of anything other than death and taxes.Anybody worried about catching Covid, dying of Covid should isolate.If you don't feel comfortable travelling you shouldn't. Risk of transmission from surface touching ? IMO - zero, or close to zero. I don't see grocery store workers, retail clerks getting sick/dying.It's not ""my data"". It's available to all of us. Have you actually read any medical, research studies on this ? Some are very easy to read / digest (Don't look at studies/numbers/charts /graphs that CNN or FOX cherry pick data from to fit their narrative)BTW - GDL. All stores take temp and provide hand gel on entry. We went to 2 ""bars"" 1 had soap, gel and a wash basin and foot bath prior to entry. They would only serve us beer with food. A cheap 20 peso taco sufficed for unlimited beer. The other bar at midnight in Tlaqapaque didn't care, they just sevred us, Waiters weraing masks, virtually everyone on the street, in shops wearing masks. As soon as you enter the restaurant/bar you take your mask off no problem."
"BTW. My wife is an RN at UCLA Medical Center. She does not work on the ward but in employee health and had to administer her first COVID test today... No panic at UCLA. Beds available, vast, vast majority of ICU cases fit the profile. Advanced age, 2,3,4 co morbidities. Virtually all admitted for other reasons.Not verifiable ""data"", (which I like), but anecdotal evidence from an anonymous source on an internet forum LOL."
#104 - I said nothing about airports being shut down In #101. Try actually reading what I was stating instead of thinking I’m causing ‘mass hysteria’ by reading something else into what was said.Borders close and flights get cancelled all the time.

#113 you said “border/flights shutdown.” Don’t change it now to say you mean cancelled flights. Shutdown is pretty clear and is not the same as cancelled flights. You meant the airports closing. Is this a joke? At least be a man of your word.
"And btw, “data” this:https:/…"
"#118 - please don’t try to get inside my head and tell me what I meant. I said flights, I meant flights. The first mention of airport shutdowns was by you. Your interpretation only."
"# 113IIt's obvious what he was saying. The only time I can recall a US border being closed to returning US Citizens was 9/11. Borders don't ""close all the time"" Cite the facts.Flights get cancelled due to lack of demand. There is obviously lack of demand right now. I don't have the exact numbers but i would guess a huge amount of international flights to PVR aren't running. They're still flying and viirtually zero chance of them being stopped. On what basis would they stop ? (Bailout money actually requires the airlines to keep flying)# 119This story proves my point. Sadly a bunch of family members got sick. Tony Green's ""Father in Law's Mother"" died. She was almost certainly of very advanced age with likely associated co morbidities - she should have isolated. She was very high risk. The Father in Law - likely ""old"" too - high risk. Tony Green ? Don't know his medical history. Is he diabetic, obese, hyper tension etc. etc. ??"

"#130 cute for you to act all high and mighty saying others are using demeaning terms while you are telling me what to do and what not to do. Personally, that’s much worse than those bad bad words you call demeaning."

Clearly? Explicitly?Is it reading comprehension or cognitive skills that are lacking?
"I'll go with ""Clearly"""
"I listen to these arguments for not giving merit to the possibility of getting this virus, and I often think how easy it is to slip into relaxing my precautions little by little after months of caution fatigue. It's easy to be swayed into explaining away contracting covid by thinking that just a few die compared to the population. It's easy to be lured into coming up with a health reason as to why some people died, or had to have their leg or arm cut off due to covid, or had to spend weeks learning how to talk and walk again. It's easier to think it won't happen to me. But from what I've personally experienced, it takes courage and true emotional strength is to stay the course. Some will sadly learn that lesson like Tony Green in KCdog's link, and some will for unexplicable reasons escape the realities of this virus no matter what. I think the question we have to keep asking ourselves no matter how young or old, healthy or compromised is ""How good am I at playing Wheel of Fortune."" I desperately want to travel, but I'm not going to at this time. So to those who do travel, please please please use every precaution available to protect yourself and others."

What I said: ""to simply act in a responsible manner and put off traveling for awhile to see if we can get a better handle on the pandemic numbers""Saying what I believe would be a responsible action at this time is a personal observation about the situation not the same as telling other people what they should do."

"^^^^^hmmm - no treatments are a cure at the present time and certainly whether any treatments will be available in PV is dubious. Will a vaccine be available by October - extremely unlikely. Even if there is one it won't be widely available instantly. If anything, counts are unreliably low because they are doing so little testing in Mexico - a more accurate assumption would be that current counts are artificially low. Just cancelled my Nov. birthday trip."

"This was really interesting reading. I see two sides... those that are being careful/cautious and taking their health/other citizens health seriously and those that are presenting themselves as being very selfish people.

And so many of you that just want your ""vacations"", sound like whiny teenagers and could care less about other people. That is clearly evident."

"DE 777Deana777 just shared the following in a related thread; “ From Pam Thompson-Webb who works with Covid patients in Puerto Vallarta hospitals. It's real and not going away anytime soon!! From Pam: People: the numbers posted on the ""government's sites do not reflect what is truly going on here in Vallarta. IMMS 42 in Vallarta has a full covid unit and now out of ventilators. Regional, same. Covid hospital at hospital Joya this afternoon was 19 because we had 2 death since this morning. CMQ premiere guessing at least 20. IMMS 33...upwards between 40 and 50. If you are telling us who live here and work in healthcare about authorities reporting correctly or not, my guess is you do not live here full time and do not understand about ""authorities"", responsible reporting here. Does not happen. And as far as commenting DOCTORA Swindle Leslie that her post is not helpful in any form, stay at home, you might consider an apology since both she and her husband are front line workers every friggin day for the past several months, so she knows what she is saying. We are in this damned mess because too many people disregard warnings and think vacation, party and bars is more of a priority. I spent my entire weekend working with 4 different families, 4 different deaths and it is tragic what is happening here. Excuse us if we are a bit touchy but this is getting damned old.”"

Nice passive aggressive post. Thanks for your fake concern.
"Robert, interesting enough, the vast vast majority of “ how dare you go on vacation right now” rants on this thread is coming from people, who are not traveling to Vallarta during summer months anyways, neither right now, because, they are comfortable sitting in their backyardas for now..., as the weather is still warm and pleasant. In PV, on the other hand, as some mentioned here a few times the weather is “ crappy “ ( not my words) at the moment. So, there is no urge for them, they don’t travel in summer, early fall anyways, thus - “ don’t go “ chants. However, vast majority of these same people ( if not all ) already have their trips planned for winter: Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb., as one of the main reason of their trips to PV is to escape from the frigid winters of places where they live. It is quite obvious. Right know many don’t even have any flights to Vallarta from their home spots. So, it is easy to preach not to travel. Just watch and wait.. when this frigid winter hit their backyardas, the tunes on this forum will change ( Yes, even though and if the virus still will be here and “ numbers “ won’t change much ) The tunes of the forum will change to : Well... we will be careful, we just get to a condo and will be sitting there the whole time, we just need our escape and can’t bare the thoughts to spend winter in our frigid backyardas. And this: “you can bring the virus and infect others “ rant will suddenly disappear. Because at this time, the plans and circumstances will be affecting THEM directly and personally. Then, “being selfish by traveling” all of a sudden will become ok. That is a human nature."
"For the people who are 100% confident with their decision to travel, no need to post on a travel forum seeking validation.Our OP here Ed asked us ""What are your thoughts?"". He invited us to comment if we believe that he is ""nuts to go to PV this winter""."
"Re #164 - as a condo owner, I am typically in the PV area throughout the year, including these summer months. It kills me not to be there right now but I recognize that the virus has its own agenda and I must stay away for the greater good."
"*****Just watch and wait.. when this frigid winter hit their backyardas, the tunes on this forum will change ( Yes, even though and if the virus still will be here and “ numbers “ won’t change much ) The tunes of the forum will change to : Well... we will be careful, we just get to a condo and will be sitting there the whole time, we just need our escape and can’t bare the thoughts to spend winter in our frigid backyardas. And this: “you can bring the virus and infect others “ rant will suddenly disappear. Because at this time, the plans and circumstances will be affecting THEM directly and personally. Then, “being selfish by traveling” all of a sudden will become ok. That is a human nature.*****I see your point and you may well be right but we will not be going to Mexico this Feb. We like a small fishing village north of PV and yeah it stinks things are as they are but we will stay home. Already cancelled our year round travel ins. with MasterCard.The thought of going to a resort or condo and basically hanging out there for the duration is no incentive to go there. I won't be sitting in my Ontario backyarda this winter, but that's ok."
"#164- I don't know about ""the forum"" but you aren't speaking for me. I won't be in Puerto Vallarta this fall or winter. I'm OK spending the ""frigid winter"" in Seattle. ""Human nature"" doesn't mean just go ahead and do whatever you want."
"we plan on being in Vallarta area starting november with only one caveat...canada to suspend the ridiculous 14 days quarantine for anybody coming back in the country...in these days when people can test fast and easy , 14 days is not normal, i expect it's going to be lifted like it was in most european countries."
"Suze how frigid does Seattle get , did it move to the middle of the country somewhere lol , I live on Vancouver Island with similar temps and I can say it is far from frigid ,go to Saskatchewan or Manitoba in Canada in the winter time and then you’ll see frigid"
It was a joke. Point is I am not (as was said) changing my mind and going to PV this fall/winter regardless of the weather at home.
"With the amount of people that have no regard for the virus, their health or the welfare of others, we will be staying home as well."
#173 Please. No. Please. Nice to see another passive aggressive shot at others from you. You just can’t help it.
"I've been referred to a couple of sensationalised magezine newsprint articles to attempt me to change my mind as to the assesment of my risk of dying of COVID and to stop be potentially spreading the vrius. There were also supposedly some first hand accounts of how bad it was in PV. One was from a timeshare salesperson....... ??? They were all nonsense of course.Let's be objective and look at the science.https:/…There's mountains of data in here to support my opinion. Eg. In Italy there were 6 deaths of people under the age of 65 with no known comorbidities. Yes - SIX . There are 46 million people under the age of 65 in Italy. Other countries show more eg. France has 307 out of approx 53 million under 65 year olds. Sweden 121 out of 8 million. Miniscule numbers. Note that these are ""known"" comorbidities - often they exist but are not diagnised or recognised ( eg. congenital heart defects).I don't need to bore you with a long list of stats, they are all in there - this is one of many papers that all have the same end result.. If someone has one that contradicts I'd like to see (no newspaper/magazine articles please or quotes from experts). The conclusion is pretty clear though: I quote:""People <65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in pandemic epicenters and deaths for people <65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic""So - if you're ""old"" you need to be little bit careful. If you're old with preexisting more so. If not - go about your business, keep the economy moving and support the tourist industry and those poor souls in PV that are struggling to make ends meet.Edited: 9:09 pm, July 29, 2020 "
Passive. Aggressive. Not at all. I’m not the one making excuses why you should go or evading responsibility to others.
"Today, at a press conference, the Governor of the State of Jalisco announced that in the next 48 hours he will analyze the indicators of the coronavirus pandemic in the state to make the decision of whether or not to activate the #EmergencyButton, which would force to stop all activities for 14 days.""We are doing an analysis in which we incorporate the economic variable into the decisions we make, because we are obviously concerned about public health issues, but we also understand that people have to work,"" was the Governor's message.NOTE: According to data from the Council of Industrial Chambers of Jalisco (CCIJ), if the ""button"" is activated, 12,700 jobs will be lost in the industry and economic losses of more than 2,300 million."
Please don’t come till next year.
"Robert, Do you know anyone, or is there anyone in your family 65+ years old. If so, how would you feel if you exposed them to the virus, just so that you could go on your vacation? I know someone who let their daughter and son-in-law move in with them after being out of work a few months. As things began to open, the daughter and her husband began going out, both parents were exposed to the virus, the father recovered, the mother passed last week. I can’t imagine what that family must be going through, a lost life for a few happy hours and a few night out. We are in our 50s and 60s, luckily my parents are still alive and both in their 80s, that risk Is not worth it for me!Edited: 9:31 pm, July 29, 2020 "

"Of course I do and of course I have family members over the age of 65. They're careful and sensible and I am around them. For sure, if you are old and with health issues and as I've repeatedly said and as the data repeatedly says they should ""have a strategy that protects them""For them to be working in the tourism is probably not a good idea. Uber driver, waiter, barman..."
"#179 your example has no effect on whether someone should go to puerto Vallarta or not. Your argument is if you know someone over 65, you shouldn’t go to puerto Vallarta. Lmao. Seriously? What’s next from you? You made your choice clear you aren’t going. That’s awesome for you. But why do you have to continue to argue against me (and others) going? It has zero effect on you."
"I’m sure they thought they were being careful and sensible too, and now regret the choices they made."

You could have donated your vacation budget to various Vallarta charities from your Covid ravaged State of California. Your Governor is asking you to Stay Home too."
See this is why I don’t stop responding. People don’t stop attacking me for choosing to go. Here’s another. I will enjoy my drunk stay. And why the hell would I go to a hospital while on vacation? I’ll be sure to post a trip report that I’m sure you’ll drewl over. Goodnight sweetheart.
"# 194Come on, this is getting absurd. Trump ? the CA governor ???The OP was to trying to solicit opinions on whether it was safe or wise for them travel to PV. There's been some healthy debate and exchange of opinions but now a small number of posters are ramping up the personal attacks and trying to make it a political issue. Cut it out."
{And why the hell would I go to a hospital while on vacation?}Because you got sick or hurt? Doesn't have to be from the virus. Food poisoning at the resort? Ecoli or parasites? Broke your leg surfing? Dehydration from sunburn and all that drinking? Stuff does happen sometimes.
#198 it’s sad I have to explain this. She is telling me to voluntarily go to the hospital. My post meant why would I do that while on vacation? Of course if something happens needing me to go to the hospital I will. Smh

"Most tourists will do what they have to do vacation anywhere which means wearing a mask, social distancing, washing hands etc in this time of Covid, I admit there are some who won’t do any of that and do all kinds of stupid things, those people should stay at home, but tourists going there this year and have their laidback vacations, spend some time on the beach , walk the Malecon, go out and buy their groceries, cook in their condo, go out and get a coffee or whatever, I see no problem and all the sky is falling types should be okay with it also. People that stay there for like 2 to 6 months have a different attitude then the 2 week people."
"Post 139 - Kansas, you should be telling people not to come. See Deanna’s post containing Pam Thompson’s statement. You are indirectly contributing to the spread of the virus, by not being forthright. You are endorsing their travel to PV. They don’t need to be careful in PV. They need to stay home and be careful there. Sheesh! It’s possible to carry diplomacy too far when lives are at stake."

"Ignorance is defined as not knowing. Ignorance has been used on this thread and other threads many times. I don't believe that many travelers or intended travelers are ignorant of the fact that COVID19 exists or presents a very serious threat. In my most humble opinion, I believe that many have decided pro or con what they intend to do. Many to travel and they will travel and they will not be swayed. I believe that others have also decided that they will not travel until this pandemic is over and they will not be swayed. Both decisions are theirs and name calling on either side is not necessary. The problem is that with travel very limited and greatly discouraged frustration and boredom comes into play. Can we put those aside? Can we state our opinion once or perhaps twice and regardless of how wrong we think the other person is let it lie. We will not change minds no matter how eloquent we think that we put it.Peace!!!"
"I don’t usually comment on these threads. I have opinions not worth sharing as they won’t be valued judging by many of these posts.I will offer my perspective for what it’s worth. I’m 66 and reasonably healthy. Now that I’m retired I’m finally able to enjoy the years I have left. Now this virus comes along. It is what it is and I’ll deal with it.What I do find a little bit disheartening is those that imply that I and others of higher risk should isolate while everyone else goes about their business as the virus continues to spread. I understand that but It seems to me that if everyone was on the same page and did what is needed we could beat this virus back so that everyone can enjoy their lives.I won’t be back to this thread as I can just imagine some of the replies I’ll get. I try and keep a positive attitude and just reading through this thread up to this point has been challenging enough.

"JNS, Sure, I've absolutely considered that, without a doubt, Gave it a great deal of thought, especially in the early days of all this when the early statistical models were coming in; March/April time frame.The early models in March were all crap, they all turned out wrong. There was not enough good data. The more data was added the better they became. Even now data is being fed into the models every day so we can predit with a huge amount of certainty what is going to happen. The supposed expert in the UK with the best models . A guy called Neil Ferguson from my Alma Mater (Imeprial College London) completely f'ed it up. He was the guy that was advising the UK gov't. He was part of the reason the UK faired badly in all this. (He has a crap track record - (he was completely wrong about Ebola also), What was happening in Italy was the first incling of what other similar countries could expect and it happened. Old people, weak people, obese people, diabetics, hypertension, etc. getting sick, young people,heathy people not. There are always outliers I don't believe any child <17 has died of Covid in CA. Eg. In the UK there was a headline that a 14 year old died of Covid with no preexisting conditions. The nation was in fear, shock, the media went to town. Well 2 days later it turned out she did have a preexisting condition - she had a congential heart defect that was the undeniable root cause. She just happened to test postive for Covid. (I am sure you can google it)Today we have mountains and mountains and mountains of reliable data and studies, from reliable sources that track millions of cases, patient outcomes, demographic info, treatment protocols that work/don't work and so on. I am open to changing my opinion and actually invited the forum to provide data (math) to do so. It has to be math - statistics whatever you want to call it. I am not interested in ""boots on the ground data "" or """"My friend works at PV hospital and she said such and such"". I doubt anyone even read the study that I posted. and no one, I believe, has posted anything rational, objective and scientific to dispute my opinion. The only thing I think the jury may be out on is whether there will be any long term effects of people that have had Covid. Personally I don't think there will be, (I think we have enough data), but as more comes in we will know more.  (BTW, I am an engineer).Edited: 10:09 pm, July 30, 2020 "

Thanks so much for taking the time to post this!"
"Thank you for your common sense post Calgary.  :)I read Robert's study link backwards and forwards more than once.  Missing in the study was accounting for lock downs that went into place and started in varying degrees during those time periods the study draws from, which is obviously going to affect the study.  And it began on varying dates everywhere around the world, and in different ways. We at least know that just 2 -3 weeks makes a difference in what death numbers and infection rates will show.     Then, Countries and the US States began opening up, once again at varying rates and in different ways during that study period.  Some people went back to work where there was set protocol, and some went back to partying where there was very little to no use of protocol.   There are way too many variables, including testing rates and availability.  It is too much to take in and come to one single conclusion. The young say they want to go on with their lives.  But those of us who are in the more vulnerable age group, would also like to live our lives to the fullest and we don't have the same amount of time left that the young have.  I'm not saying the younger people should give up living their lives for us, but they could use more consideration in what they choose to do, and especially how they choose to do it.   btw, I'm not going to argue the merits or downfalls of the study any further.  :)Edited: 9:33 am, July 31, 2020 "
"RIS. I've never once said it is my right to travel (although it is). What I've said is that there are some increased risks due to COVID - even for me. I've tried as best as I can to quantify the risks. My conculsion is that the risks are small so I believe the risks are worth it. What I would have a concern about, and this has been mentioned, is the availability of healthcare (if the system collapses) for something unrelated such as an auto accident, (more likely than Covid - see below), or even needing a simple course of azithromycin (see Calgary's post). Right now it seems the healthcare system in PV has not reached anywhere need this point.If anything you're post was rude. I've not posted anything that shows I've a flawed character or have a problem mentaly.Karen. You need to read the study again because it does not look like you understand it, at all. You're just rambling about lockdowns, testing avaiability, people partying and throwing comments out that make no sense or have any relevance to the study. If you did read and understand the study I have to assume that you no longer will be driving an automobile.Try this study, it is maybe a little easier to digest. https:/…sars-cov-2-analysis-of-deaths.It's very different. A lot of focus on the preexisting conditions. End result is the same though."
"My criticism was not intended for you, Robert. Perhaps I should've been more specific re: those who selfishly boast about heading to PV because they can...and desire a vacation. Like the one from CA who just recently arrived. What a piece of work that one is!"
"Robert you want people to read your links, but you can't accept their thoughts on them. I answered your link like an adult.

"Apology accepted Robert. Although it's a popular term... and although I'm not a conservative, in defense of my conservative women friends, to some women it has a certain ring of misogyny when a man uses it, no matter whether the women are Democrats or Republicans. :) Like I said, I'm not going to argue the points of the study. I'm going to take the precautions I'm taking no matter what, at this time anyway. My husband absolutely cannot get this virus."
"""My husband absolutely cannot get this virus.""And that, in a nutshell, is the reason this is such a polarized & divisive issue. On one end of the scale are those who want the world to stop in order to save the vulnerable. On the other end are those who believe life should go on as before while protecting the vulnerable. Although the majority of people likely hold views that lie somewhere between those extremes, you'd never know it based on what you see in the media - both mainstream & social. Most of the media appears to be more interested in fomenting dissent and engaging in social engineering than in objectively reporting the news. This applies equally well to CNN & Fox, both of which are actually pretty tame relative to what you find on social media, including sites such as this. The media loves to scare the crap out of people, and later wonder why people are afraid. They love to present the glaring exceptions, rather than the norms. They love to present contradictory & confusing information in sound bytes without making an honest effort to get to the bottom of things. And they're really good at finding 'experts' to support whatever spin they want to put on a story. Far from being limited to covid, these phenomena unfortunately materialize on pretty much any significant issue - and lots of insignificant ones too. There is no obvious solution.Bringing it back to the matter at hand: I personally have several risk factors, but I don't expect the rest of the world to stop because of it. It would, however, be helpful if society would be willing to invest in itself by following simple protocols that don't actually represent much of a sacrifice in the grand scheme of things. It seems that's asking too much for some, though, so the vulnerable (myself included) had better look out for themselves as best they can."
"OT_Bound, my sentiments exactly. ""I don't expect the rest of the world to stop because of it. It would, however, be helpful if society would be willing to invest in itself by following simple protocols that don't actually represent much of a sacrifice in the grand scheme of things. """
And above...I'm referring above to travel and daily living everywhere during covid times.
"Larry. Well, actually, the media (most, all even ?) does propagate fake news. Governments too, including the US Gov’t. They sometimes do it for good reason, sometimes not. It’s naive to think they don’t. WMD - Colin Powell gave a very infamous speech at the UN. Lot’s and lots of evidence the administration knew it was fake/lies. Remember the “boots on the ground” data from the UN weapons inspectors at the time was that there were no WMDs ? It turned out there weren’t. It was not a failing of US intelligence. Pure lies.It was very costly. 100s of thousands of innocent Iraqis lost there lives. Thousands of US and allied troops lost their lives for no reason. Many more thousands wounded, some horrifically. Media coverage at the time was awful. Gov’t behavior even worse. So , yes. There is such a thing as fake news and Governments do get stuff wrong - all the time."
#259 - What does all that have to do with traveling to Puerto Vallarta? Nothing. Nada.
"Suze. Correct. Nada. The question was asked whether the media has fake news or whether governments get it wrong. Rather than a single word answer ie. “Yes”. I offered evidence to back up my position. I know this is an alien concept to many on the forum. I guess I should have offered evidence in the context of the the thread. I can do that as well if you would like but it would likely fall on death ears, at least to the ones posting. To the lurkers ? I am not so sure.Edited: 3:50 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Suze2 - You are absolutely correct. When someone pretends to know national and US military classified data it is time to return to the thread name.Are we totally Nuts? I believe every individual has to make the decision for themselves as to if they intend to travel or not, why they intend to travel and where. They have to decide if risk factors out weigh the pleasures or reasons for the trip. May factors come into play and we actually never know what might influence a person or persons to travel or in any other factors."
"Robert. One study does not prove or disprove anything. It’s simply adds to the data, so not worth quibbling about. It took me about ten years to learn how to critically read medical literature. I’m not a statistician which makes it harder, I’ll admit, but a few stats courses helped. I am waiting for some good meta analysis, (a statistical analysis of multiple good studies). I think at least one - two years before we get any really good meta analysis as it has to start with a crucial mass of studies, most of which would be eliminated as ‘bad’, so it will take a while. The fact is, I can read till I’m blue in the face, and I can weigh the risks. But this we DO know, as it applies to ALL viruses and bacteria: - crowds will help spread a virus - not physically distancing (as is on a plane, even with filters) will help spread a virus - not wearing a mask will help spread a virus - not washing hands *properly* will spread a virus *exponentially*- enclosed spaces will help spread a virus - touching your face with infected hands will most likely infect you These were the rules on pandemic mitigation that I learned in the seventies when studying the Spanish flu., and infection control. We also learned that the Spanish flu was spread by travel (troops WW1), poor hygiene, and poor health.So, as I concluded before, travel will spread the virus, otherwise it’d still be in China! Sure you maybe young and healthy and conclude the risks to *you*.are low (for now). But all travellers are still potential spreaders - especially the young and healthy. And I don’t fell very good about want spreading a virus to a country with very limited health resources, when many residents are begging us to stay away.To go back to the OP question. I believe travelling during a pandemic *is* nuts. Others will make different decisions, but I fear it will only keep the virus happily spreading. The result is that the horrible state the world is in will be prolonged. And ‘winter is coming’ which is particularly brutal on the Canadian prairies. Sigh. Vacation money can be spent supporting the food bank in PV and other areas. Helps to ease the pain for me and for others!"
"Your conclusions based on your expertise are wrong. There is zero evidence being on places increases risks of COVID-19Edited: 4:46 pm, July 31, 2020 "
Thanks #264 ‘love to travel’ (I do too). Not sure what you mean?
"It wont let me edit. Sorry for the spelling error. Zero evidence traveling on planes increased risk of Covid. Although I admit it is likely, there is zero scientific evidence."
"I know this person in the link below who is head of Healthy Buildings at Harvard, and he is well known in his field. He wrote about air travel explaining how to fly safely. There are probably other articles since this one. My husband is a pilot and isn't afraid of flying as he knows aircraft systems, he's only worried about the airport itself if protocol isn't followed. Anyway, you can find a lot more about Joseph Allen if you choose...and he is writing a lot and making news appearances about how schools can open right now. It's all about the ventilation no matter where you are. https:/…"
"# 266 I wouldn't say ""likely"" by any stretch. How do we quantify likely ? > 50 %. ? TSA stats show that there were 20 million people passing through TSA checkpoints in the US in July. If transmission is likely - where are all the cases ? I've flown maybe 50-100 times per year for the past 25 years. Never with a mask, usually on jam packed flights with no social distancing. Invariably there is someone sniffling, sneezing, coughing in the vicinity. If virus transmission was likely I'd always have a cold. Can't remember the last time I've had one. Not a very scientific analysis and I don't think we need ""proof"" for this one as common sense dictates to me it is certainly possible. But IMHO, low risk - more chance of getting dysentery in MX and needing medical care for dehydration. (Co incidentally, the studies that have been done on airborne transmission of viruses on planes actually state that there is a bigger risk of catching something via the fecal / oral route. Yuk. I've got too much time on my hands)"
267. Lot of good info in this article. He looks at the huge numbers of people flying and the lack of any evidence that people catch viruses on planes. (Of course he acknowledges that stuff gets transported from place to place via the plane).
"Post #264 this is a new virus and planes have been grounded. How can there be any data or evidence.Edited: 11:20 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"#270 planes are NOT grounded. Anywhere. What are you talking about?Edited: 11:21 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Perhaps it is a matter of wording, because I think I've noticed people saying there are less flight options from Canada. But maybe I'm wrong about that."
#271 - Not all planes are grounded but there ARE flight cancellations and rescheduling happening. You can see that just reading thru this forum of people's various personal experiences.
There are some companies who have grounded planes in Canada. Right now sunwing g is the only carrier left still grounded. Flight options are definitely less than normal in Canada right now with transat pulling out of western Canada altogether for the 20/21 winter season.
"I think he is referring to cancellations, so many flights departing from Canada to Mexico have been cancelled or suspended, same with flights returning, not sure if many will be operating in high season either."

"Well, we just made the flights. Quick 5 day trip. Aug 5th to the 10th.  Bit of a bummer as the flights we were eyeing got cancelled and we now have to fly from LAX via SFO. I'll be trashed as I have to go to Vegas on the 4th, Staying at Villa La Estancia in NV. This'll be our 3rd time there (done the one in Cabo a couple of times also) If you've never stayed there before the place is awesome. Great condos, right on the beach. Resort style services/bar/pool. It;s a great time walking up and down the beach, esp. up to Bucerias. Karen's for breakfast, Toscano Mia for dinner. Will rely on Uber primarily but will probably rent a car for one of the days for a day trip to Sayulita.. Won't do a great deal, much of our time will be at the pool/resort. Will post some findings..."
Safe travels. Looking forward to hearing your impressions of the travel & your stay in the area.
Yes that is unfortunate. Flying to San Francisco from Los Angeles to get to Puerto Vallarta?
"I’ve had to fly from Vallarta to Seattle to get to my home in Portland several times. That’s a pain too, lol. I just wave as we fly over the top of it..... and then back down again. Robert_A_C123...... We’d love a trip report from you but please start your own personal thread so it doesn’t get lost in this one. Plus, everyone will see it that way."
"Robert -- post 277: Yes, La Estancia is gorgeous....I own next door so have been there.Make sure to post in the Nuevo Vallarta TripAdvisor Forum, which is relatively active, as that's where La Estancia is located. I'm sure the folks in that forum would be interested in your report. We also enjoy that walk into Bucerias. One of our favorite things to do while staying there, next door.Good luck on your quick trip."
We are hoping situation gets better everywhere..We are booked to go to PV Oct 31st...
We are hoping situation gets better everywhere..We are booked to go to PV Oct 31st...We presently wear mask in all indoor facilities and social distance outside...don't plan on going in restuarants. Time will tell.
i live here full time & i wouldn take the chance of coming down here even though December seems so far away
"I decided to stay in Mexico when the outbreak happened. I have not regretted that decision. Common sense tells you what to do and what not to do. I am in Bucerias, and any place that I have gone...grocery store, Home Depot (anything that can break, has, in the last 4 months), restaurants etc...are all practicing sanitary behavior. I have not felt unsafe at all! BUT....I do not go out unless it is essential. If you want to come and do all the things you would normally do, then no. Stay home! If you want to come, hang out at your pool, eat mainly at your place and occasionally venture out, equipped with face masks, hand sanitizer etc, then come! As for the hospital numbers....they don’t generally include the private hospitals. Yes....the IMSS hospitals are overwhelmed in many areas. Yes, the virus is here, but probably on par with the US."

"OP: I totally agree with Calgary.........OP Chicago: No One knows Winter more than anyone from Winterpeg.......Manitoba, Canada............ I HATE Winter, and staying home this winter too............But, what I would HATE Worse - Waaayyyy Worse, is getting Sick,. Or being hospitalized (if there is room) and, Something Even Worse Being another statistic in the Covid 19 Pandemic. Think about Family, Friends, and Relatives too, in your decision making. It’s Not the End of the world, But it could BE The END, if you don’t listen to travel advisories.......and Stay Home This year........There is always next year.........You won’t freeze in Chicago......Turn the Heat up, get cosy by the Fire Place with a margarita or Whatever........and think of Next year in PV. You are very Fortunate to have had those 30 years to bask in the Mexican Sun.......Don’t spoil it!!!"
"Living in Ontario, Canada I understand winter too,, and I lived in the snow belt for far too long. It is not the end of the world to have to stay home this winter, as we plan to do. Better safe than sorry is my theory. Hopefully the winter of 2021-2022 will be better."
"Hi, sorry upfront if this repeats, I haven’t been on TA in a while now. But this is the first topic I clicked on and I only read your question..... I have read zero comments. When you say the term , “you can’t bear”... whatever the rest of that sentence is on any forum or topic.... then don’t bear it. Are you nuts?... no one here can answer that, because buts to you is I’m sure different from. It’s to me... I would urge you to do you... safely and with good measures, but simply do you. Period. Happy travels wherever you do."
"So, I just got back from PVR. IMHO if you're cancelling or delaying a trip to PVR I think you're making a mistake. The sky is not falling in, people aren't dying on the street, (nor in the hospitals). For the most part it is completely business as usual, less the volume of tourists. TBH it felt remarkably like SoCal. Yes, people are wearing masks, they have ridiculous rubber trays with some liquid they ask you to stand in when you walk into a store/restaurant. What exactly is this supposed to achieve ?? There is no fear amongst anyone we encountered - in fact, quite the opposite.It's definitely unravelling for the deniers. Give it another month,"
"""IMHO if you're cancelling or delaying a trip to PVR I think you're making a mistake.""By making that blanket statement, you are implying that people who are not comfortable travelling right now are making the wrong decision. That's like me saying :IMHO if you are traveling or planning a trip to PVR you are making a mistake.(I wouldn't presume to tell people if they are right or wrong) You absolutely cannot assume you know how other people feel about this global pandemic, therefore any statement you are making is just your own personal opinion.""deniers"" works both ways"
"“IMHO” - don’t you know what this means ?It means it is my opinion. It might not be yours. It’s not a blanket statement. If someone else doesn’t share my opinion that is fine. Don’t go. My opinion is just that, my opinion."
"Didn't you read the rest of the post?Point being not telling people they are making a mistake if they do something else you don't agree with. I don't care if if you go or not (anywhere) doesn't affect me in the least...Nobody's own decision is a ""mistake"""
I didn’t tell anyone anything. I posted my opinion and was very careful to say what I thought and that is was purely my opinion Of course I can read. You obviously can’t.
"""IMHO if you're cancelling or delaying a trip to PVR I think you're making a mistake.""Opinion :a thought or belief about something or someoneYou might be able to read(?) , but it seems like we differ on word interpretation"
"Well, we pulled the plug on our trip to PV this winter. This will be the first time in 33 years that we have not gone to Vallarta. There is just too much risk for us, Covid19 running rampant and our health insurance does not cover us in Mexico. Therefore we regrettable have cancelled PV for this year."
"It'll be the first time in 16 winters we have not gone to Mexico, so yeah, that takes some adjusting to! We will be fine at home. Better safe than sorry. PV or wherever will still be there when it's a better time to go."
JKBABCSANDAN. No. That’s not how the English Language works. I gave my opinion. You are contradicting yourself and making yourself look foolish - and I am being diplomatic.  I am very careful that I don’t tell anyone what to do. I voice what my opinion is. It may be wrong. If someone does feel comfortable coming to PV the they shouldn’t (obviously.). I support that opinion.
"Robert_A_C123-And now your telling me how the English language works and calling me names.Very diplomatic of you. Thank you, but I do not need your opinion on how I should communicate.People will decide on their own whether to go or not on vacation regardless of you saying it is a ""mistake"" if they choose not to travel.. I respect each individuals decisions on travel without labeling their decision."
"JKBSANDAN Please just read (again) what I wrote. What you post makes no sense, it’s completely out of context. I didn’t call you anything. Way back when the OP solicited options on whether they should make a trip to PV. I’ve spent the last 5 days in PV so IMHO I have an informed opinion that it would be a mistake to cancel/postpone a trip based on fear of COVID. You don’t agree. That’s fair enough. If you can’t stand someone’s opinion that doesn’t conform to yours you shouldn’t be posting on any kind of forum like this."
"Robert_A_C123I'll try one more time!Opinion :a thought or belief about something or someoneYou think or believe that it is a ""mistake"" for anyone to postpone or not travel to PVR based on ""your"" opinion. Why are you calling anyone's decision a mistake, if they have a fear of Covid-19. Please re-read what I wrote! It's not about agreeing /disagreeing with you. I respect everyone's contribution to a discussion unless they try to label other people's decisions that are not aligned with their own interpretation of experiences. Maybe it's you that should not be posting on forums if someone has a different view you do not agree with. And what does this mean? ""It's definitely unravelling for the deniers. Give it another month"""
Boring!! Everyone is leaving the room .......?
I'm so sick of the continual petty bickering on TA!
"Just for the record --- Eleven days ago, I filed a report with staff on this thread asking to have it ""Closed for Further Comment"" as it had gone way downhill (off-topic, runaway, etc.) and the Original Poster had never returned. A clear candidate to just fade off of Page One sooner than later. I have a ""case number"" and ""acknowledgement"" for that report and will re-file it immediately.For now, it is not a productive thread and hasn't been for awhile, with the person who asked the question never returning again. It's making Page One look unwelcoming.We can solve this ourselves (temporarily) ---- by not posting to it again.Thanks everyone. The ""community"" can control this ourselves for now."
