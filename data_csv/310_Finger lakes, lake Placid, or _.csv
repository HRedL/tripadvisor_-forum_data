"HelloLike everyone else we are looking for a getaway from nyc. Something 4-5 hour drive away. Mid august. I ruled out lake George because I feel it will be crowded. We are interested in swimming, kayaking, hiking, and more swimming! I adore waterfalls also but not if they’re swarmed with people! Bike trails could be cool too. I’d love to wake up early over sunrise standing over a lake with a cup of coffee in my hand ready to jump in but I also feel like those accommodations would be too costly haha we are looking for budget friendly places to stay /Airbnb styles, or glamping might be of interest. Any suggestions are much appreciated"
"Ive actually been to ithaca, Lake George and Lake Placid this yearIt partly depends on your price range, Lake Placid was the most expensive (I actually stayed in lake George because Lake Placid was so expensive)I was in Ithaca memorial day weekend and the Waterfalls were crowded even if the city was dead. If you want Waterfalls, then its IthacaProbably more to do in the Adirondacks (You can move around there if you don't like one area) Ithaca was probably the cheapest to stay and Lake Placid the most expensive ( I stayed in Motels you can drive to room to avoid elevators and hotels) The lakes in the Adirondacks were nicer IMO especially with the mountains around them"
Lake George and Lake Placid is more compact than Ithaca. Lake George was crowded 4th of July weekend
"If you don't want crowds, the Finger Lakes or the Adirondacks (outside of Lake Placid and Old Forge/Inlet) would be your best bet. Weekends anywhere without crowds will be a challenge at the state parks.Ithaca makes the best base in the Finger Lakes for what you are interested in - there are three beautiful state parks in the area (Taughannock Falls, Buttermilk Falls, Robert Treman) and Watkins Glen and its state park is only 30 minutes away. Ithaca also has an excellent weekend farmers market. The FL are also NYS wine country.If interested in the Adirondacks, look at Blue Mountain Lake, the Keene Valley or Saranac Lake.Edited: 10:25 am, July 13, 2020 "
"I was in Ithaca Memorial Day weekend, It was dead there because the colleges had closed. I don't know how it is now, but the colleges really arent open now so its probably still quiet"
"That’s a good point about colleges being closed, I’m sure it will be crowded when I go hence going the week before they open back up. Thanks your input everyone! Very helpful"
"With COVID-19, Ithaca College students aren't back on campus until October; Cornell is still undecided."
Information regarding arrival and move-in at Cornell should be available in late-July. Classes begin on 9/2/20. You will miss the crowd in Ithaca if you come mid August.
