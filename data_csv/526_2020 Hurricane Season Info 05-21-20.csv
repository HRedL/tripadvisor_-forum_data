"Yesterday, the NHC posted its predictions for our hurricane season. They are predicting a normal to maybe lower than normal season for Hawaii. That would mean between 2 and 6 hurricanes/tropical storms/depressions for Hawaii. The season is from June 1 to November 30th. It would be nice to have fewer storms given CV-19!https:/…"
Did they mention locusts?
"Locusts are so old school, Betty Lou :-)!The new ""in thing"" for an insect threat are Murder Hornets:https:/…"
"Still need to be prepared and hope for the best. They are suggesting masks in your hurricane kit now and , of course water. Could also use the TP you have been hoarding!"
"Of course, Shanty! I would never suggest being unprepared. I have seen many years where the predictions were of little accuracy, too.And of course......it only takes one bad storm to make any others meaningless. But here's hoping for a calmer season :-)."
Think folks have been thru enough already.
"Yep, like I said-it would be great to have a more quiet season!"
The Covid-19 Pandemic makes a hurricane look like your best friend from high school you haven't seen in years!
"For Hawaii CV-19 was not a lot. But hope no hurricane.Hawaii seems to always have plenty of floods, fires and droughts though."
"Someone PM'd me objecting to the way I posted............and wanting to nitpick *exact* numbers that will affect Hawaii. As said in the linked article:""Chris Brenchley, director of Director, NOAA National Weather Service – Central Pacific Hurricane Center said that is near the average of 4-5 per season. Experts note that this does not specifically address or predict how many of these tropical cyclones will threaten directly the state of Hawaiʻi."".........there is no way to say how many will affect Hawaii. Could be none, one or 6............ we are always given the same kind of warning/forecast.See here for more info:https:/…https:/…I hope this eases the PM person's mind.I would prefer to never have another Lane or Olivia on Maui alone..........just sayin.SWEdited: 5:59 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Thanks for updated, more accurate info you posting in #9 above, and correcting your original. That info above more accurately reflects that the prodiction of 2-6 events is NOT specficially for the Hawaii area, but the ENTIRE Central Pacific Basin. Huge difference!As you restated......""Experts note that this does not specifically address or predict how many of these tropical cyclones will threaten directly the state of Hawaiʻi."" Doesn't really matter tho, not many tourist are going to be coming btwn 6-1 and 12-1."
"LOL, Tim. People who have rental property or family here may disagree with your final statement......and of course, some of us who live here, as well :-).I've posted the same info for many years--and you were the first and only person to read it the way you did. Glad my follow up post made you happier.Thanks for bumping this though....you reminded me I need to do my annual info thread now!SW"
