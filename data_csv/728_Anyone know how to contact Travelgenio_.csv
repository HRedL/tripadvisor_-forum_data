"I booked a plane ticket from China to Japan. However, unfortunally, because of coronavirus, my schedule has been changed and also Japan has stoped issuing tourist visa for Koreans. So now I cannot get a visa go to Japan.I sent email to Travelgenio, but I have got no answer, I don't know how to cancel my tickets. Anyone can tell me how to contact Travelgenio?? plz~@Travelgenio"
Lots of info already on TA about travelgenio. All you can do is wait for them to respond to your email. And next time do not use travelgenio.
"Just wait for the annoying Travelgenio bot to surface and go from there. At this point, just assume that your money is gone, and be happy if you get anything back."
"Look down this board, Jin. There are at least 25 threads here complaining about TravelGenio, some going back many years.They are a terrible company and you chose poorly in picking them.If they don't go bankrupt you may eventually receive a small portion of your money.Please RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY in the future. You found this forum today, if you had looked before you bought you never would have chosen this company.Even good companies are struggling through this crisis. Bad ones will do worse and may go bankrupt. Have you attempted to dispute with your credit card company?"
Hello Jin. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days. Thank you for your cooperation.INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"Chances are if you finally manage to get in touch with them somehow, you'd still have to jump through their generic loop responses of first saying it is not refundable, then saying you need to pay a certain fee, who knows what's next after that? I've been told the best chances are to open up a dispute with your bank/credit card company."
"Hi Casssandra, as told in other post, refunds depend on airline times to authorise and manage them. Once we receive them they will be refunded in the same payment method used for the booking process. Further details can be checked in the link provided above. regards"
I have been waiting for the refund for 5 months now. It says that the money has been refunded but nothing on my account! this company is a scam!
"Obviously , their hotline keeps hanging up on me. So cannot even talk to anyone"
"Advice in post 5 works for you, Anass. We have 20,000 complaints here and very few satisfied customers, so you may end up with an expensive lesson learned. This has been a bad company for many years, well documented as such"
"Anass J, Talking about refunds, we are constantly contacting airlines to be able to make them effective the sooner the best. Anyway, we must follow their procedures and this can take some months without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
"Don't let that message give you hope, Anass. If they are constantly contacting airlines then I must be a green skinned, 3 metre tall alien from the planet Imbecilus 4."
"You have notified us few weeks ago that the money has been refunded but it never landed on my account! Impossible to talk to anyone as the customer service line keeps hanging up on me! The airline did refund you, please transfer the money! thanks"
"Anass, note that Travelgenio charges a fee of €50 per ticket to process a cancellation regardless of the party initiating the cancellation. So if you ever receive your refund it will be a bit light. But €50 is a lot less than many third parties charge."
"Anass, If you have proof (in writing) that the airline has indeed refunded Travelgenio, then why have you not contacted your credit card/bank with this proof to get your money back?"
"At least Travelgenio should have the decency to have someone answer their phone (In Australia it is in Chatswood, Sydney). Instead of leaving airline ticket holders in limbo, They could simply advise that they are in trouble financially and can not refund the ticket price, which seems to be the case. It is just plain rude and unprofessional to not advise us. It is a case of lesson learnt not to book with third party. Book direct with the airline company. There goes my AU$950 and all the fish that I would have caught in the pristine waters of Western Australia's coast."
"Harry, do you have an address for them in Chatswood? Their registered office is shown as Gladesville."
"Harry: that would require them to hire customer service reps, and that is the opposite of their business model"
"Thank you Harry for your comment. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our specialised agents."
"I can imagine that even if TG was prepared to spend money on having people there to answer the phone, the responses would only be identical to the garbage spouted by the bot.So then everyone would be complaining about that instead."
