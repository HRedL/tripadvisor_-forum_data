"Our May family (two kids 8 & 10) holiday got cancelled. We planned to tour Yucatan for a bit before chilling AI for a day or five at both Now Natura and Riu Yucatan. We now hold a fistful of vouchers and wish to return to Yucatan if and when it is safe.However our requirements have now changed. Post Corona requirements now include:- Direct beach access- Loads of pool space, some slides for the kids would be great- Many non buffet restaurants to choose from- As much al fresco dining as possibleSo we are looking for a big resort with loads of space. I do not want to tip toe around people all the time or having to wear masks and stuff. This should be a relaxing holiday!Anyone suggestions?"
Wait until next year.Cs
"Ummm, no resort is going to be Corona proof as we are in a pandemic. If you are really bothered by protocols, it's best to wait and see... As the other poster said, that's not happening for this year"
I agree there will be nowhere that is corona proof. If you are that nervous that you feel the need to tip toe around people then I would wait till next year.
It is not about being nervous. It is about avoiding crowds. If there are a 1000 guests in a hotel is is easier to keep a bit of distance on a 1000 meter stretch of beach compared to a 200 meter stretch of beach.
"""Corona proof family resort""You will have to wait for a vaccine. BP"
Fairmont Mayakoba fits most of those criteria but I know they have closed their pool slide as should everyone else right now. Giant resort and very spread out even in normal times and although I can’t get a straight answer I believe they are operating at 30% capacity. They are going way over the top on precariously
"Ok, I understand now... There still isn't going to be a hotel that is COVID-19 proof. It's preposterous to believe that a facility/building could have that label.What you should do is research resorts/hotels that have great safety/health protocols and procedures in these COVID-19 times"
"Nothing is a 100%. When swimming, waterproof sunscreen is better than regular tanning lotion but by no means actually waterproof. So this is not meant literally. Nonentheless, some resorts will be more proof compared to others. Why dine indoors if you can sit outside where the risk of infection is virtually nill."
"Not sure where the idea of outdoor dining would be safer than indoor dining comes from. If someone coughs/sneezes and the droplets are airborne, it's just as easlly spread outdoors as indoors. In fact, with a breeze, possibly it would travel further outdoors. Many/most resorts will have protocols including fewer tables in restaurants. How the tables are set up for the next guests, menus cleaned, etc. Reduces occupancy on the resort will translate to less people anywhere on the resort and in the restaurants. But, if they don't open all the restaurants each day, that would result in more people using the ones that are open. Look at the Iberostar Maya or Lindo.. Or, maybe the Grand Palladium Riviera Maya complex."
"There is a lot of evidence that this virus thrives less outdoors:https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Is-…Palladium indeed seems rotick many boxes. Thanks.Edited: 10:39 am, June 19, 2020 "
"I can’t understand you how you feel about the coronavirus. It is a very dangerous virus and that’s why it’s a pandemic. I hope you can use the vouchers for next year as the dates for the resorts to open keep changing. It may be prudent to wait until next year if your vouchers are still good. However, if you’re looking for a larger resort, I would tried the grand Palladium or the Moon Palace. Both are great resorts, they have loads of pools, kids clubs and are on the beach. Good luck and keep us posted on what you decide."
"Barcelo has captive dolphins in a small concrete pen.Have you considered renting a condo, you can combine eating out and hiring a chef for a few meals. Can also hire a maid. More space to spread out and a fridge to store drinks, snacks etc."
"Based on your general criteria, I would suggest Hotel Xcaret. They have so many dining options, including having all meals delivered to your room, you can't go wrong."
"I've had the same dilemma and upon some research, my adult family and I are planning on going to Grand Bahia Principe Luxury Akumal. The hotel is a part of a 4 resort complex but it would be the only one open July 1. The rest of them will stay closed until November so there will be a lot of space although I am not sure how it will play out with the restaurants. I emailed the resort and they replied that they are still waiting for the government to finalize all the specifics. They have their protocols on the website along with the list of the hotels that will be open and when. They have great customer service, as per our previous experience, so it's really easy to communicate with them to find out all the details down the road.  Last year, we stayed at the Palladium and truly enjoyed it. It would fit perfectly given the situation right now as it's a huge resort spread out with a very vast and uncrowded, even at full capacity, beach. Unfortunately, I found out that if you book it for this summer, you will be ""upgraded"" to their sister resort close to Cancun and this is not something we would like. As of occupancy, right now all the hotels in Orange zone, per government guidelines, are operating at 30% capacity. I understand all the risks of going to Mexico right now and considered a staycation here in Florida but I believe we would risk much more here since a lot of people here act like there's no pandemic at the same time as Mexicans abide by all the rules and protocols without questioning them, as per reviews and forums I was able to find. I even found a live cam at Hard Rock hotel and can see everything that's going on there in real time and it looks like people are having a great time there without all the crowds and all the staff wearing masks and cleaning constantly. Good luck and have a great vacation!"
"I’m sorry, but it’s corona proof is in your title and your list of requirements are that you not be inconvenienced in anyway including having to wear a mask to protect the people that work there from you?Yeah you need to not plan to travel this year"
The Palladium has put very extensive protocols in place. They are handling opening 1 month at a time so if you book the Riviera Maya for August or later it may be opened with reduced occupancy. Costa Mujeres will open on July 1 but it is closer to Cancun.
