"With the rise of COVID cases in AZ, I wanted to know what everyone thoughts on ""traveling to Sedona"". I've read articles and went on City website which says that COVID is less in those areas. Regardless, I understand that we have to take precaution etc but with almost 6 months of being locked down, we just need some fresh air and scenery. I am also curious if restaurant and stores will be open weekend of July 16-19th which are the days we are planning on visiting Sedona. Thanks in advance for your help!"
"Well keep in mind that the temperatures may thwart some of your ""fresh air."" It is in the mid-90's with temps rising to 105 this weekend. Restaurants that remain open for dine in have (obviously) reduced seating so wait times may be more than you are willing or able to wait. The situation for ""lock down"" isn't much different than what you are supposed to be doing at home other than by name. You say you need a break from your routine at home but it isn't much different than what you are ""supposed"" to be doing in Sedona."
Lovbeach - well said. I didn't see your response before I posted.
dbmove....I am just over everyone thinking AZ is open for tourism right now yet we turn on the TV only to continually get bashed for our high covid numbers. We didn't get here all by ourselves and the posts in these forums is making that quite clear. What makes people in other states think if it is not safe or allowed to be out in their own home states that we actually welcome them here?? It is just so irresponsible on their part. Arizona is not open to tourism at this time due to covid! Be safe!
"I think Luvbeachgirl's answer should be the response to every question on every state's forum. Watching the NBC news tonight it sounded like March/April all over again - shortages of PPE, long lines for testing, deaths, rising numbers every day. People should be staying home. Yes I have a trip planned for the fall but if the situation is the same on Sept 1 when I need to start cancelling things I will be cancelling."
"We have a Colorado River raft trip planned for September. These trips are being run, and have been since June 13, with Covid protocols in place. The US has handled the pandemic so poorly that we have no hope of improvement for at least 6-7 more months. It’s not realistic to expect people to sit at home. We take every possible precaution, but life is too short to just stop living it, esp. for us active older folks."
jodi890...Today here in AZ a major hospital system just announced their morgue is now full. FULL! They are now asking to have refrigerated trucks brought in as morgues. You are beyond irresponsible by traveling to a place that is already too strained to even care for their own residents. It is the lax attitudes that many travelers have that is causing this virus to continue to spread further. Arizona is not open for tourism due to covid!! Reschedule!
"In that case, you should notify outfitters who operate in your own state."
"I'm an active senior who cancelled my trip for early August. These are trying times for so many people, I don't need to add to someone else's problem.Stay home, stay safe."
jodi890...It is about being a responsible human being and doing the right thing. It very obvious not everyone has that same mentality. These forums make it crystal clear and travelers to our state are another reason our numbers are through the roof. We actually have some businesses here in AZ that are willingly disobeying the Governor's orders. That is further straining emergency services (police) who are forced to field complaint calls. Certain types of business licenses have now been pulled by the state and citations issued. One company challenged the Governor & his Order and lost in court. Hopefully your trip is cancelled/rescheduled by the state or operator. Arizona is closed to tourism due to covid!
"I have checked several websites and can find nothing about Arizona being closed to tourism. Having talked to our outfitter I find it hard to believe that longstanding and well-respected outfitters are operating illegally. If anyone can direct me to the information that Arizona is closed, I’d be grateful."

"Here in the Uk there was a long segment on the Coronavirus outbreak in Arizona on the British BBC news channel last night so it beggers belief that post 14 says they have heard nothing about Coronavirus in Arizona. It has been reported in newspapers too. If the UK knows about it so must elsewhere in the the US, everywhere! We are due to start our annual US road trip visiting Arizona and New Mexico early September and will today start cancelling all our bookings. We hope our flight into Phoenix will be cancelled nearer the date, as UK/US borders are not open yet to visitors. We do not need to spread this dreadful disease across the Atlantic or anywhere else, and we certainly do not want to return home with it! So please stay alert and do the sensible thing by staying home during this dreadful time for everyone, everywhere, wherever you live to save lives!"
I agree with RedRox that the river portion is probably less risky than other activities you may do on vacation in AZ. To me the risk is if you contract C19 while traveling to Lees Ferry and then experience symptoms while on the river or even just before you reach LF. That area is not equipped for any more cases and it isn't like there are medical care facilities readily available or close by.
"Thats totally irrelevant. If you trip and break your wrist you are taking space in a hospital. Just dont go.Im baffled at why the US has not declared an emergency and shut the interstate borders and put the hotspots in full lockdown.Im shocked reading this forum of how many people are traveling, puting workers that have no choice at risk and allways making selfish excuses like that the risk is manageable. Well looking at the numbers its obviously not being managed.Sending best wishes to all the locals and workers that are forced to cater to this insanity to be able to survive.Everyone else stay put FFS."
"RedRox...So disappointing to see you actually tell people if they can get to AZ ""safely"" that the river trip will be ok. You do realize people are coming through airports right? After flying in giant petri dishes for hours? Oh and our own TSA agents here in Phx are spreading covid now too. Phoenix Police have Officers assigned to Phx Sky Harbor Airport too. I will spare everyone their high numbers of covid positives due to our recent protests. There is no getting to AZ ""safely"" anymore.Our resources here in AZ are stretched to the hilt due to covid and have no room for extra people looking to escape their own states out of pure selfishness. How is everyone still in denial? https://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_cov…"
RedRox...Really? It is about the bigger picture of further bogging down our already maxed state resources. AZ does not need any additional people to deal with at this time because they are just irresponsible. Reply #21 & 22 both mention how the area isn't equipped for more cases and a simple injury takes up space in a hospital. Our healthcare workers & first responders need people to be responsible. How & why exactly is traveling to our state still encouraged by people here?
"How? Because many people believe they understand how to travel responsibly, airlines run, beautiful campsites are available, hiking and river trails are open, guides are eager for business...Why? As many different answers as there are people.It’s the same in my beautiful state of Washington. What’s less understandable to me is why people want to pack into crowded areas when many other lovely spots are much quieter."
"I am from Texas and visiting Sedona right now. Sedona is packed full of visitprs or maybe say tourists. I mean, if you have been here before say last year or the year before that, you do not see a big difference right now. Every single camp ground along highway 89 from Sedona to Flagstaff is FULL. There is a very long line of cars on the road with nowhere for people pass by. Some Restaurants are open. A lot of peoppe dine in. Sit close to each other. As for the people camping, there does not seem to be any social distancing or much use of masks. I wonder if they are families or friends camping with each other. But many of the people I could see from the road had no masks on, were gathered around their tables and looked like they were enjoying each other's company. Large groups of people."
I would have been in Sedona this week but cancelled. Did not want to risk traveling with my 85 year old mom who is in great health. We will try again next year in June God willing.
Good decision.
"“It is not realistic to expect people to sit at home”. Not forever, no, but long enough to flatten the curve and keep the infection rate low. And then require people to behave properly when they do leave home.European countries were able to accomplish this. Why can’t states in the US? Behavior. Look at the numbers. Italy, with a population of 60 million people and a horrible experience with infection and death rates in March and April, has started opening up and yet has kept the infection rate very low—-a total of 669 new cases in the whole country yesterday. By contrast, Arizona, with a population just over a tenth the size of Italy (7.2 million people) has reported between 2,000 and 4,000 new cases every day in July. It is just not a good time to travel in the US. Stay close to home and explore what you have right there. Do not travel to a state where the health system is already overwhelmed—-the local people need it. This is going to require patience and persistence. If we cannot manage that, it will prolong the misery and result in many many needless deaths."
"Enzian,Well written. We will travel again when there is a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine or if early onset COVID-19 therapeutics become available."
"The voice of reason -- thank you, Enzian."
">>European countries were able to accomplish this.To be fair, we have our share of selfish b@#£rds and ridiculous governments here in Europe and we are still not out if the woods. This is going to take a year or more and we need people to be reasonable for a year or more.But its obvious that (shocking) the more culture of social responsibility and selflessness, the better. You guys are in for a wild ride with the huge amount of selfishness and inmaturity in big part of your population and your governments. Its so sad to see, my heart goes out to you and I hope things get better.I hope the selfish people realise they are killing others with their actions and they change."
"Post no 27 by PetitFrereArmada clearly explains why places like Arizona, California & Florida are in such a terrible state.One simple word describes those people ... selfish. They should have stayed at home.I love my holidays to the USA but even if your government allowed me to visit, I wouldn’t be so irresponsible or arrogantly selfish. Others people’s health is far far far more important than a vacation.Hope you get this situation under control soon."
"We have postponed our trip to the USA from October 2020 to June 2021 and I'm hoping with all my heart that things will have returned to some sense of normality by then. I would not dream of visiting an area already under immense pressure and potentially adding further strain. I wish you guys all the best, hopefully we'll all get through this and we'll see you on the other side!"
"When the continual closures and new edicts keep coming...and coming...and coming. The more businesses will fail and all over America. IMO it will already take a lot longer than 2021 for places like Sedona...a small tourism-dependent area to recover fully from the economic impacts. The impacts also are trickle-down to ALL areas of the country since normally we have been so free and interconnected. People from all over America and the World beyond... tend to vacation in/near well known & popular tourist attractions, that are all being very affected this year. It includes National Parks/Monuments, small resorts, cute mountain or lake towns, beach towns and even Big cities and their nightlife. They don't normally want to drive down the road to places with nothing to see & do or places without hotels, cafes, shops and medical facilities to service them. Or places without the normal Special Events that are so fun.Scenic auto tourists willing to drive and see America as a whole... instead of specific popular places may have an easier go of it... if the sanitation/hiring issues do not severely affect the lodgings along the way. Or if the air flights getting to destinations do not continue with the severe testing and distancing edicts they must follow. The most scary of which right now is that if you develop a temperature from any other reason than Covid...you will be denied getting onto a flight home."
Lol Karen you can't stop me from coming to arizona I will come to Arizona if I want and there's nothing you can do about it. You can't close an entire state because you are scared.
