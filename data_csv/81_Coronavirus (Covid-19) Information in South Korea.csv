"Hello Colleen,Thank you for your concern.But, many posters don't read previous posts when they have questions.I am afraid this is just one another post in this forum.Why don't you use your authority like getting this thread pinned?"
"@JHL - this post is in the process of being pinned and you should see it as a sticky within the next 24 hours. Thank you!ColleenTripadvisor Content TeamEdited: 10:37 am, March 09, 2020 "
"I actually asked in the DE Forum how to do this - it's a shame that it took so long. Usually, I'm very helpful here, but I can't take the 1,567 posts a day of the same questions. Hopefully this will work.Personally, I think all of us that reply here should only reply to questions here. Save our time and energy."
"agree entirely, Michael. I'm not replying on Seoul forum except to new questions, but am seeing all manner of wrong or out of date threads and replies, in passing."
"Good idea to focus all C-19 talk to one thread. I'm surprised it's not inundated with questions but I'm guessing most people have already cancelled their trips or are more worried about things closer to home right now.For those based in South Korea or already there on holiday, what is it currently like? Are most things closed? Tourist attractions, restaurants etc. or is it almost back to usual? We are hearing that known cases in SK are falling but we are a bit concerned still. I think someone mentioned 48 out of 50 are wearing a face mask there. What happens in restaurant or at bars, does the mask have to keep being removed with every bite/sip? I hope that's not seen as a stupid question! I'm just trying to picture it all.A message has been posted in another thread I imagine by a local saying:''Seoul is very dangerous because the transmission of the Korona19 virus has just begun. also Jeju Island is also dangerous because there are more people infected. All schools are currently closed in Korea, and it is getting serious as the school is due to be extended until April. It's not appropriate to travel. Please cancel it.''...which does not sound too promising. Seoul and Jeju being two out of 4 places we are due to visit.I'm equally concerned that WE may not even be allowed in the country by the time we are due to leave (early April) due to developments in Europe/UK! Whether that's by FCO advice or we show a symptom on landing at Incheon and have to be isolated for 2 weeks.I think I'm even talking myself out of it just writing all this. British Airways have last night offered vouchers that can be used in the next 12 months, so perhaps postponing it would be best. Might just lose money on accommodation, internal flights, car hire............So looking forward to this trip :("
"Most museums and some attractions are closed.But, 90+% of stores and restaurants are open. They just eat and drink without masks. Unlike other countries, very few Korean restaurants, cafes and pubs have outdoor tables. If they do, it is likely to be areas few people come and go. So, it is not that horrifying when you walk down the street.I think cancellation of schools isn't what travelers should be concerned."
"I think you will be fine for your trip. Presuming of course there is no sudden, large widespread infection that reappears. It's *fingers crossed* quieting down. School is delayed until April 6 to avoid even ""small group contamination"" as that's their focus now. That's the next (last IMO) critical phase they just said in the news.Palaces etc. things are open, with modified schedule, and empty.Restaurants are all open, I haven't seen one closed for the virus unless they're forced to close for cleaning. People still go out. Of course, I live right by Gangnam Station, so it's a busy area. However now it's not AS busy. I think you can still enjoy your trip!"
I am still hopeful that my June trip will go ahead...Only glitch at present will be if Singapore Airlines decide not to fly to and from Seoul [and any 14 day quarantine period imposed by any country] .Travel insurance a bit of a concern with the pandemic exclusion though...Keeping my fingers crossed.
"Just back after a week in South Korea.Don't know how it usually is, but on the streets and metro in Seoul it was very, very quiet. Only place which was lively and had some atmosphere was Gangnam area. Very few tourists, only saw some in Sokcho.Edited: 12:50 am, March 18, 2020 "
Government's official COVID-19 update:http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/
"I've been planning and preparing for my trip to Seoul, Busan, and Jeju for almost 3 years. It was scheduled for October, 2020. I'm trying to decide if I should postpone it to March 2021. I'd hate to wait even longer to go (3 years is a long time already), but if there is still a 14 day quarantine when I arrive, that wouldn't work. Plus the virus is still going strong in the USA at the moment, so that could affect even being able to fly to SK. However, there is still more than 3 months until my trip, so literally everything could change by then...or not. Who knows at this point. I'm seeking input from those of you who have more experience travelling than I do and are more familiar with South Korea. I have booked and paid for all my lodgings, but they are all changeable/refundable if necessary. Because of the COVID-19 quarantines here in the States, my passport has been delayed in arriving so I have not purchased by plane ticket as yet. So, all that to say that if I have to postpone, it's totally doable. I'd rather visit in the Fall than the Spring for various reasons (including work schedule) but either will work if I plan for it properly. What would you do? Thanks in advance for any advice you can give."
"I would just keep your plans as scheduled. Don't cancel until the last minute that you can. Korea is doing very well with the virus, everything here is open and normal (just with masks). They may drop quarantine, but really nobody has any idea. Also, most airlines and hotel sites don't have any rules in place for October flight refunds yet. So you'd have to wait for those rules to post, too. You still have four months.For what it's worth, I'm planning a big Europe trip for two weeks at the end of October. I still have refundable hotels booked etc. and am PLANNING to go....but I'm EXPECTING it to be cancelled if Corona keeps acting up. I imagine IF I have to cancel, I'll do it late like early October just before the trip."
hi... i'm going to korea next month for the language course and the university said I can't stay at the government-run facility because my visa type will be long-term (d4).i want to know if it's possible for me to rent a house from airbnb for the 14 days of self-quarantine and then move to the dormitory?
"I am also going to Korea next month and have some questions regarding self quarantine. I will stay at an Airbnb for the quarantine period and then move to the dorm at my uni. I have a long term visa and asked my Airbnb host if it's fine to be quarantined there and she had no problem, so I guess I would not have to be quarantined at a government facility right?What if you don't have any Korean person that you could contact? I asked my exchange agency about it and they gave me the number of someone who is responsible for the student visiting program at my uni but I doubt that that person could answer any personal questions? Would that number still be enough? Or should I rather provide the number of my host? What if she doesn't provide 'services' like this? And what happens if the contact person doesn't pick up? Is it possible to be quarantined with a friend together? We both booked the same Airbnb, we have the same flight, would arrive together, will attend the same uni etc. that shouldn't be a problem then right?Thanks in advance for any help!! :)"
I'm in a similar situation. Following.
"Don't expect to be together unless you're family and have proof of relationship. AirBnb is technically ok if you have a long term visa. If you are coming without a visa, just entering ""visa-free"" then you must go to government facility. Most of the AirBnB hosts will be your ""local contact"" if you ask them. That being said, you need to be VERY SURE of who you choose. They MUST MUST MUST answer when the govt calls them every day randomly. If they don't answer, that's a hassle for you. Big headache."
"Hi there!As an exchange student in Seoul for this fall semester, I just booked my Airbnb for self quarantine from August 13th. At this moment I am figuring out how to get to the place. I've read some things here, reddit, quora.. But it's never the same. This is what I am sure of how things will go:I will show them my reservation and adress, they will ask me how I am planning to get there (no idea for now), I'll get some couloured card. That's it for what I am sure of..But what I assume is, we ourselves have to figure out how to get there, right? It's just a little complicated as we aren't allowed to take public transport. Any suggestion or tips are welcome!"
"It's very ""simple."" They will arrange everything. So depending on where your ""district"" (gu) is like Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, Mapo-gu etc. They will group you in arrivals for a bus. Expect to pay for it around 15,000W or so. Some cheaper, some cost that much max. Everyone in the bus is going to the same Gu district office (like administrative office). From there, they will take you in a gu district operated van to your address. It's very ""sterile"" and you're not gonna be out there on your own roaming the streets for sure haha."
Is South Korea open to travellers now? I can't seem to find any news about this. Thanks in advance.
Local travelers do some. Most public facilities are running.Yet to open to foreign travelers.Still have 2-week quarantine once they arrive.
Thank you so much for your reply. Are there any plans to open by September?
It's possible.But there's no plan as of today.
"I unfortunately wouldn't expect quarantine to go away until 2021 when winter is over and countries have it together (hopefully). That being said, even if you do quarantine - to be honest, Korea is WIDE OPEN and everything is in full swing and life is good here."
Did anyone get an answer on what to do for the phone number issue for quarantine? I know I have to download the app but will not have a local sim card for my phone and will quarantine at university. Thanks
"You ABSOLUTELY 100% MUST MUST MUST have a local contact. That means you should find someone at the university office if you are quarantining there. If you are at AirBnB (you will have a visa so you can go to ""a residence""). Even if you have a Korean friend, that will work."
"As i understand it, if you are on a short term visit visa or basically free visa you have to quarantine at a government facility. What if you are a foreigner on a long term visa. Do you still have to stay at a government facility or can you book your own accamodation to qurantine? I also heard of hotel that are picked by the government to serve as quarantine facility. Can you pick your own hotel or do they pick where you quarantine yourself upon arrival at the airport.?"
"Long term visa, even entering on your ""first time"" can stay in their own place of residence. Some have reported AirBnB, but again try to have a ""real house"" first. There are many hotels, but also they use corporate training facilties etc, too. You can't choose and there's no way to guess what you get. You could be in the Grand Hyatt next to the airport OR you could be stuck in a dormitory in the middle of nowhere."
"i haven't seen anyone writing about their experience in a government facility. how does it look like? will you be locked up in a hotel room? how much does it cost per person? How about travelling with young children?Edited: 4:45 am, August 14, 2020 "
"You're not looking hard enough - there are tons of youtube videos, reddit posts, and blogs. Basically, yes, you are locked up in either a hotel room OR some type of ""dorm facility"" like they use for corporate training or retreats (bare bones, not fancy). You have no choice in where you go, just pure luck where they put you. And you must pay for it yourself around 150$ a day (when you arrive). You are literally stuck in that room for 14 days and don't go out once."
"I was wondering does anyone know that if your final destination is Busan but landing in incheon first , will you have to quarantine in Seoul or do they allow you a flight to Busan from Incheon airport. Or would they let you take a train to Busan and just quarantine for 14 days there instead having to quarantine in Seoul. I plan to go visit my girlfriend in the future but she lives in Busan which is why i would Rather quarantine close to her."
"You have ZERO choice in where you quarantine as a visitor. They take you whereever they want and watch over you like a hawk haha (a few people ""escaped"" recently so they're more strict). Then basically when you're done you're on your own to get wherever - they drop you at a train station/airport again I've heard. Besides, you'll be in quarantine so it doesn't matter where you are honestly. Then once you get out just go to Busan. They want you moving as little as possible around Korea while in quarantine. No train, no flight not at all whatsoever."
Thank you for your response much appreciated. I heard About the escapes.
