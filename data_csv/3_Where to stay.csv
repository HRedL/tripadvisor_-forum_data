Where to stay (area) in Rhodes in July with the covid-19 restrictions? Worth to book tickets for 4 days with the covid-19 measures in Greece on July (what is close)?
"I imagine the restrictions will be the same across the island so covid won’t make any difference in that respect. What you are after in a location (quaint or busy etc) is up to you. But whether it’s “worth it” for you to go somewhere for 4 days with the covid restrictions when according to your location you already live somewhere with a Mediterranean climate and beaches , is up to you to decide."
