"May, you must look for an INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL HEALTH INSURANCE, at least valid for Europe, better all the world.- This is very easy to find in your country with GOOGLE."
"And be aware that with the COVID-19 situation, many countries are not covered by additional insurance."
yeah that’s the problem that they don’t cover
"Because of C-19R most of Insurance companies DO not cover you for certain things and to be honest the Tavel insurances gone sky high.Look for a travel insurance which cover Macedonia as NON EU country and make sure also covers you for C-19RI am due to renew my annual Worldwide cover but my current provider do not cover certain countries as per usual ( one of it being USA) So I have to look for another which also has C-19R coverage because also on some long haul flights won’t let you without that particular cover.Have you tried AXA? Or people like Prudential ? WorldNomads is very good one too, have a look on their website.Edited: 7:57 am, July 22, 2020 "
