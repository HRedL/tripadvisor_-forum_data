Is anyone else worried about the increase in infection rates? We are due to travel next week but will need to pull out if the uk gov impose 14 Day quarantine On return which will mean we cannot go.

"I'm traveling tomorrow morning and worried only about our gvt and air carrier corona games creating obstacles on our plans. Because, if they will write Croatia in red, airBaltic cancel flights and we need some other, probably more expensive flight options to get home. Virus is nothing, compared to those - much more real problems.Edited: 2:45 pm, August 13, 2020 "
Thanks for option.
"Croatia seemed to be doing quite well, so today’s number was kind of shocking tbh."
"Yep worried. Key indicator rate of cases per 100,000 gone from 18 to 21.5 to 24 in the past 3 days. Rate at next Thursdays 4 nations discussion is key. I'm due to fly on the 22nd."
"Very worrying, I’m due to fly to Split on Tuesday for a weeks holiday. Unsure of whether to take the risk and hope for no quarantine on return to the UK"
"We are due to flow to Dubrovnik from the UK tomorrow. Just saw that Croatia has recorded the highest one-day jump in cases - but let's keep in mind that this is from a relatively low base, and that there has only been one death (if I'm not mistaken). But, who knows what draconian quarantine expectations the UK government has in mind for arrivals from Croatia..."
Are you due to be away a week or more? So far UK has only changed rules once a week after a Thursday data review. If you are due back before next Thursday review I'd be reasonably confident.
"I’d be worried. They are demanding quarantine from travellers from Netherlands (for good reason), France, and Malta now. Just a matter time before Croatia gets added, at this rate. Going to Croatia will not be an issue but it does seem likely Croatia will be on the list as soon as you return?"
We are due to go next saturdya 22nd August what do you think chances are?
"My dear travelers from the UK. I'm not sure how bad you need vacation. I don't know if your government will implement two week quarantine on return from Croatia, and even if you can allow yourself to be quarantined for such time period. I can only speak for myself and I will take my chances by going to the UK in a few days. Who knows when this nonsense will end and will we ever travel as before. About increase of the ""oh so dangerous"" covid rates. Most of these are young people clubbing. Therefore, if you tend to avoid crowds, you should be fine."
"That’s good to know, thanks. We are due back Sunday of next week. Guess we’ll just have to wait and see."
"Ian, currently numbers are going up. Next day or two will indicate your chances more clearly. I think it should be fine."
"Welcome to the UK, where the case counts are far worse than in Croatia, as I’m sure you’re aware!"
"Eeva, thanks. I'm sure it will be great. We can't get enough of your country. :)"
Am morning arrived in Split. Have not yet seen crowds in proper sense. And so far Croatia remains in our Latvian Witnesses of Testing Counters yellow zone for one more week. But my wife get scared that it can be changed in future and flights will be cancelled...She is very fearful person. I really hate those Witnesses!!!
"Thanks for the advance notice Tarik on todays cases, that number will bump the rolling average case numbers over 25 tomorrow then. The magic number where we all need to shelter (sarcasm). Im off to look at Italy whilst prices are still low.As for how much we need a holiday? I cant see this getting any better for at least another year, and i live in Scotland where we have no summer!! I need some sunshine"
I am just on my way back from Croatia and Italy - and Croatia was so much more laid back than Italy - I hope Croatia will work out for you - I can’t wait to go back to Croatia
@Eva what was your experience in Italy? More mask use? Also where were you? I can switch to Naples flights for a reasonable price right now but the price will go up if Croatia goes on quarantine list.
"I was only in Venice but they were very strict about the mask - if it fell under your nose on public transport, some designed person would come and firmly let you know. I understand but it did not feel very relaxing on a vacation. Something of that sort never happened in Croatia."
It is probably different in the south of Italy.
"Yes, you need a mask on a bus in Croatia as well but the atmosphere about it is more relaxed - people are kind about it. Venice was tense - understandably given what Italy has been through."
We are flying on the 20th for 10 days - so hard to know what to do. I’m not worried about the safety measures we need to take and being safe whilst we are there. We are in Istria so cases v low. It’s just the quarantine that will be a problem re return to school
"@Eva, I'm glad you had a good time!@Iain, I hope this works out for you. Would be shame to miss it..."
"North Italy was hit hard and such relaxation is not acceptable. People coming from low infection countries do not understand it, but that's how it works.South Italy is different, rules not followed properly"
I understand it completely but of course it is more enjoyable to be on vacation in a place that’s not on high alert - I love Italy - it just felt so different- but I of course understand.
