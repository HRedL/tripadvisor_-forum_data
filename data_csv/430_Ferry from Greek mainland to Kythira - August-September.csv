"Hello,Are there any ferries from Greek mainland to Kythira in late August/early September?Thank you."
"Assuming the COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted, there should be a daily ferry service from Neapoli to Kythira during the summer (https:/…). We shall see...."
"#1Well, I couldn't find any ferries for late August/early September from Gytheio or Neapolis, even though I read there should be one from that place (with SeaJets).#2Thank you very much.Edited: 6:40 am, April 08, 2020 "
"#2Btw, this is the place called Neapoli Voion on Google, right? Not the Neapoli at Crete, right?Also, maybe you know the price of the ferry?Edited: 6:43 am, April 08, 2020 "
"Yes - that's the right Neapoli! Timetables are here: kithiratravel.gr/en/bookingtimetable/dromolo…Looks like twice a day until 7th September and then once a day thereafter.The fare is 12.50 one way (44.50 for a car). You can buy the tickets from the booking office on the main road by the dock. As I recall, you can't book in advance online, although it is 2-3 years since I last did the trip, so this may have changed"
"By the way, it's Triton Ferries, not SeaJets. The Gythio ferry usually goes to Kissamos in Crete once a week on a Wednesday, and stops at Kythira. I can't find any confirmation that this is going to run this summer. Given the current situation I wouldnt rely on it"
"OK, that's perfect, thank you very much. :)Hope covid-19 crisis will be over by that time."
I just found their schedules: https://tritonferries.gr/en/schedules/
">>By the way, it's Triton Ferries, not SeaJets. I can't find any confirmation that this is going to run this summer. Given the current situation I wouldnt rely on it<<The Piraeus-Kythira-Kissamos ferry that calls once a week in Gytheio is now the Aqua Jewel from Seajets. It's supposed to go all year as they have a contract with the government that subsidises this route. You'll find the schedule here: http://agreekisland.com/ferry-ionis/The Ionis (Triton Ferries) that was on that route before is now on the Lavrio-Kea-Kythnos route.From Neapoli it's the Porfyroussa (Triton Ferries) that goes normally daily except Wednesdays. Allthough in the summer (June through September) they also go on Wednesday."
