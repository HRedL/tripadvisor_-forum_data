"Why didn't you follow the advice you were given in your previous thread that you've deleted the OP on? I'd also advise you remove this post as well due to you posting your email address, unless of course you want a lot of spam, or worse."
"It is not a good idea to post your email address on a public forum.Anyway, there are probably hundreds of similar complaints about this agency. Try to take a look at them and decide for yourself what you have to do. Don't get your hopes too high. A lesson learned perhaps?Next time, book directly with the airline NOT with an OTA."
I suspect like most travel companies they will be dealing with things in travel date orderthey do state not to contact them until 72 hours before your flight. Expect the emails you have sent will not be looked at until 23rd May as they prioritise passengers with travel dates before then- many airlines also are not dealing with refunds for flights so far away currently so Travel2be will need to wait to be within the airline timescales
"In his previous post the Op posted his booking ref, in this one he's posted his email address. I'd assume that if anyone had both bits of information together they'd be able to get into the Op's booking. For his own sake, the Op needs to learn how to stay safe online..."
