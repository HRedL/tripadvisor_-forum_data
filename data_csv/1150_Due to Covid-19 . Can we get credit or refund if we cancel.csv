"Hi,Anybody knows that we can get credit or refund if we cancel our trip to Honolulu this summer due to Covid-19 ? . Thanks"
"Only you can answer that. Where did you book, with who, how, etc., etc.What do the policies or terms say??"
probably maybe
"I booked Flights, Hotel thru Experdia and I also bought insurance in case I canceled . But when I tried to cancel hotel, so it did not refund or credit back . Only if I cancel flight, they can credit back. It's hard to call them at this time"
You will have to go through Expedia. That is your only choice.
Go directly to the entity you purchased from. We cannot speak for them.
When?The date matters.
Thank you. I will keep it in mind. Next time I will book direct.
"Call Expedia. You have to work with the business you booked with. In your case Expedia. You do not have a contract with the hotel or the airline. You need to go thru this route. If Expedia refuses, then try your insurance. Lastly, if all else fails, then file a dispute with your credit card. You have to do the calling yourself. It is your money!"
