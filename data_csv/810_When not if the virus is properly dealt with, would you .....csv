prefer going on a cruise first or visit Vegas first ?
"I will probably never take a cruise. This is not the 1st time that the cruise lines have had problems, and probably won't be the last. Cruise ships are more vulnerable and the solutions aren't as simple. It just isn't worth the risk."
"Used to love taking cruises, last one was 6 years ago, at that time, said never again...after this Covid stuff, never ever again"
"I cruise about 3 times a year. By default I will hit Vegas first. You live once, I am loving life! Cruise on!"
"C-19 wouldn't scare me away from taking a cruise, the fact that many ships have come down with norovirus over the years would. If Vegas isn't normal, I'll find some tribal casino that is and spend my vacation there."
"Vegas.I've never taken a cruise and I never will...they just don't appeal to me, even before coronavirus. I need a big beautiful pool area with palm trees when I'm on vacation...and to be honest, I just like having my feet on the ground. Being out in open water scares the crap out of me so the closest I'm ever gonna get to doing a cruise, is when I'm riding our BC ferry to Vancouver...lol."
"@Darmom. Bummer, I thought you and I were going to host the first TA Vegas Forum cruise. Now what do I do?"
"Lol In-Seeno-Man! Well if you want to make it a cruise from Vancouver to Victoria or vice versa, I'm in. ;)"
"I love cruising, and have a KISS Kruise booked for October. There is no frigging way I am getting on that boat. If they don't cancel it'll I'll be forfeiting the money."
Vegas first and then a cruise.
"@Gina, If they do not return your money you need to shout it, shout it, shout it out loud."
I'm really hoping they cancel it - I just cannot imagine 70 something year old Gene Simmons being willing to get o a cruise this year either. Keeping my fingers crossed.
I'd be more afraid of KISS fans...
"I agree, that would seem a little crazy. It says that cruise is sold out and has a wait list. I am shocked they can not refund people since they have a wait list. You will probably be in luck as I doubt the cruise happens."
How do you all even understand the title? Lol.
Babbel has taught us a little nuzzja
"I actually have a cruise that was booked pre Covid19 scheduled for November and I'm truly thinking of canceling. So, with that said, Vegas will probably be my November trip."
did you mean babble like this ?.....Trump babbles an incoherent response after he's cornered by reporter over mail-in voting hypocrisyThe president just spouted completely baseless and incoherent conspiracy theories at Wednesday's press briefing.
Vegas. There is zero chance that I would ever set foot on a cruise ship!
I love cruising.
">>prefer going on a cruise first or visit Vegas first ?<<I have no desire to ever go on a cruise (never have), so nothing has changed in that regard. I prefer to be on a beach in the same hotel for the duration of my trip. I can go out each night to bars and restaurants while spending my days on the beach. People on a cruise are on a boat with thousands of others, pull into port, are hearded off for a couple of hours to take some boring tour of whatever city that they are in, then hearded back on the boat a few hours later to eat cruise ship food with the cruise ship crowd. No f-ing thanks.Im currently looking out my window at two cruise ships that were out to sea longer than they should have been. If Im not mistaken one still has about 20 passengers on it after being docked here about a week that cant get off in the US, the cruise started in Chili. The issue may have been resolved but I havent heard that it has??Edited: 4:15 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"I will never take a cruise. Not because of Covid-19 scares, but because they are full of people who enjoy going on cruises."
I took a cruise ten years ago mostly because one of the ports was an island where my cousin lives. It was a great day with family. Otherwise though felt like I was in prison. No more cruises for me.Thus my answer is Vegas.
"I just reached out to my travel agent today and canceled my Alaskan cruisetour. Sad day. I was supposed to fly to Alaska and then cruise back. I have cruised 2 other times.But, I am certainly looking forward to a Vegas trip as I cut my other one short because of the virus. I left LV on the 16th and by the 17th things were being shut down. At least I got a tiny Vegas fix at that time."
Vegas for sure! I’ve looked at cruises leaving Singapore and cruising to multiple places around Asia but it really just doesn’t appeal to me and after Covid-19 it never will!
Kay ....did you shut the door on the way out ?
No cruise for me. Vegas all the way
"I’m a one and done with the cruise thing. We went one one over 30 years ago and never had the interest to go again. Vegas on the other hand, we can go multiple times in a year."
"Have a cruise scheduled with friends in September celebrating their first fall as true empty nesters. Part of me hopes it will go on, another part hopes we can reschedule.I'd be happier to go back to Vegas, because I can choose where I play and eat, and if necessary, find places where I can avoid crowds."
"Well i am booked vegas then dallas then houston then a cruise in september i hope it goes ahead been on 4 cruises all with royal carribean never a problem, they enforce people to wash there hands which i like so hurry up and leave covid your not wanted."
"We have taken but one cruise, and it was a small vessel on the Napa River, for wine tasting.It was just OK, and that was in 1996.I cannot imagine taking another, so Las Vegas.Hunt"
"Nuzzja,Now how about a cruise on Lake Meed, with a side-trip to LV?Hunt"
sign me up ASAP !
"The closest I'll ever get to a cruise as a single guy who will never get married is watching ""The Love Boat"". So I'll take ""Fantasy Island"" character Tatu's advice...""the plane, the plane"" ... to VEGAS, BABY!"
Even as a super skeptic of this while thing I dont know if I can trust cruise ships. They just seem to be the epicenter of diseases for some reason. I was in the navy for 20 years too so would like to go on one but they really havent done anything to fix the issues.
Las Vegas. I love the city and feel its my second home. Never been on a cruise in my life and don't plan on going on one either.
The cruise issue is a real dilemma for many. Those who had cruises booked and were forced to cancel only received a credit for a future cruise. (at least two friends of mine anyway) So you either risk it or lose your cash.
