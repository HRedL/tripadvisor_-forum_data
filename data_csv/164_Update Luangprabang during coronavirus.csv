"Is not a really answer but I would like to open a post to any update in LuangprabangActually in Laos there are 14 cases and only 2 in Luangprabang, the city is quite died because bar and restaurant are closed (only delivery and take away service available), hotel/guesthouse with guest are open while the others ones are closed too, in the market fruits and vegetables are still availables and we still have a supermarket (in Dara Market) open for western food. Many attraction like Royal Palace look close but temples still open (remember now only if necessary you can go out, to buy food and some urgency)...No International or Domestic flight from Luangprabang but in Vientiane still having some flight (arranged from the Embassy) to back USA, Australia or Europe.Tourist visa you can extend to Immigration office (no limit until this situation will finish)Lockdown supposed to be until 19th April but let see the situation. Hope can be useful and I guess after 19th April we will have a new update"
"Look like same situation as before, the lockdown still in Laos and now between provinces, so if you wanna travel from Vang Vieng or Luang Prabang to Vientiane you need a permit to show the police, you can ask the embassy this document (if you need for example to take your flight)"
