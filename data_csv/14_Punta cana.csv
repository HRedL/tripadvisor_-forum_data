Have my flight for July 27 for 5 days in punta cana. Should I delay or is it relatively safe. Thanks in advance.
Relatively safe...could you elaborate?
Its safer than H-Town right now in terms as it has low levels of the coronavirus if that is what you mean.
"Mike,I meant covid safe sorry should of been more specific."
#2 I might delay my vacation this virus is getting a bit out of control.
"Covid wise, things have been very good in the region. The vast majority who live here have been abiding by the regulations for face masks and distancing. I am actually quite proud of the community for doing so."
"Pretty sure no one in Punta Cana wants folks from Houston to come visit.Just saying.:-)Edited: 11:02 pm, July 03, 2020 "
Thanks mike
"I'm going to be flat out honest...The concern should be the COVID-19 stats in Houston, not Punta Cana. It is definitely safer there vs Houston regarding COVID-19With that said, have a safe trip."
