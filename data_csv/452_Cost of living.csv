"Hi guys , first time on this forum so please be gentle ....lol .Have been looking at a few places to stay next year and cant decide between all inclusive of self catering. Personally i prefer eating out and supporting the local businesses but can you tell me just roughly how much to live on for 2 people per day , cooked brekie , light lunch with a couple of beers and a mid range meal with a botle of house wine .Would £100 per day be enough. Thanks ,Gary ."
"I dont like AI. I like to get a small apartment , clean comfortable, limited cooking, fridge to keep beer , wine & Matexa cold, Brekky I normally do cerial, fruit with yogurt, then as you say snack in Taverna overlooking the sea then evening meal. Snacks with drinks on balcony in the evening, Just perfect. I'm a single guy & don't go mad but I have what I want with the food & drink so I would think that £100 per day per couple is more then enough on food & drink, & buying what you need in apartment, you should get change from that. Only hope now is that we can all get out there to enjoy it again. I go Sept & stay in Alykes."
Thanks joe much appreciated
"A full cooked breakfast with toast, orange juice, tea/coffee goes for around 6 euros. A light lunch with bread something like a Greek salad will cost around 7-8 euros. Evening meal starters go from around 4 euro upwards as do sweets, main course anything from 8-9 euros upwards. Large draught local beers around 3.5 euros, spirit with mixer around 6 euros, and local wine in a restaurant around 7-8 euros for a litre (called a kilo). Supermarket bought beer cans and wines are much cheaper. A six pack of 2 litre bottles of drinking water is around 2-3 euros. £100 equates to around 113 euros going on today’s exchange rates so you should be fine providing you aren’t a big drinker. Definately this island not a place to go A/I as the restaurant foods are quality at very good prices.Edited: 11:57 am, April 19, 2020 "
Thankyou thats very informative and appreciated.
"Hi. There’s just one thing I’d mention Gary. Somehow, I can’t imagine the very reasonable prices we’ve enjoyed in the past will stay the same, think I’d add just a little, maybe 10% or so, on to the above prices. Greece will really feel the pinch of this year’s poor season (along with many, I know). It’s definitely the cost of drinks that pushes the bills up at any time though, even cokes and coffees.We self cater, have nibbles on the balcony in the afternoon with a cool drink some days, all purchased from the supermarket and local bakery. It’s nice to completely chill sometimes. Then, there’s the occasional gyros (about €3), yummy and filling. Forget about staying AI in Greece, they don’t do it particularly well and, by comparison, the meals you get in the tavernas are delicious and freshly cooked to order. The carafes of house wine are usually worth a try too, some are very good and keenly priced compared to bottles.Good luck with your research!Edited: 2:14 pm, April 19, 2020 "
"Twinkletoes , the 10% increase you say might happen could even be a 10% price drop as everyone will be fighting for customers. Not that that matters , the main thing is that they survive this truly horrendous virus."
"Excluding accomodation I usually count on €140 a day as a couple. This includes renting a car or two 70cc motorcycles. We always have dinners in the better restaurants, pay for drinks and sunbeds on the beach. One island is more expensive then the other. Naxos is a lot cheaper than Paros... since you mention Zakynthos as your destination... we found it rather affordable. You and Greece deserve better than all inclusive-vacations, enjoy!Edited: 2:41 pm, April 19, 2020 "
"Can’t see that myself, margins are so tight anyway, little room for a reduction I would have thought. But, who knows? Depends if people return in number next year. Plenty seem to be rebooking anyway, which is great news."
I realy hope so as i dont want to see people struggling. Lets hope things get back to some sort of normality sooner rather than later.
"If you like a wine for nightcap on balcony look on the bottom shelves of the shops you will find the local wine on plastic bottles. Very GOOD value for money, I prefer the red and hope to consume a few during my stay"
"AI isn’t what Greece does best. You’ll have a much more Greek welcoming experience (and a la carte food cooked just for YOU and served at your table rather than having to collect it from a buffet) if you eat out at local tavernas. It’s hard to say whether £100 a day is enough as no one knows what the exchange rate will be next year, equally no one knows if restaurants & bars will have to put up prices to make up for the lost revenue. I’d try to put a little more money aside if possible. As others have said, eating breakfast and lunch at your apartment and drinks on your own balcony is one way to manage if funds are tight. If you like spirits and intend to drink on your balcony, bring them from home in a plastic coke bottle in your suitcase. Branded Spirits can often be more expensive in Greek mini markets. Mum and Dad raised their eyebrows when they saw how close I was to the airport weight limit, but changed their minds when they saw the cost of Bacardi in the Greek supermarkets, and I produced my plastic bottle containing Tesco’s finest..."
"great advice,many thanks ."
Im sure will be enaought.
"More than enough. I budget €100 a day. And we stay bed n breakfast. We find some days you will maybe binge (first few days of excess) then the rest just balances out. For example. Stayed at the cronulla bed and breakfast last year. For two weeks. Took €1400 did what ever we wanted to do. I.e within kalamaki no excursions. Drank at any bar or restaurant, ate at any bar or restaurant. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and had €200 left at the end. I budgeted for €40 morning to early t’time. And €60 for a nice evening meal with drinks. But you find some days you don’t need that meal every night so the money rolls on. Forget th AI as I’m sure most people have said. So many nice tavernas,bars and restaurants. For cheap excursions we used the free bus to banana beach. Pay for sun beds, food drinks or whatever and free ride back. Excellent day out."
"For 2 of you? Yes €100 a day is easily enough. Look at specials boards in restaurants to decide what you want to pay for your meals. Some are cheaper than others.Relating to SC/ B&B against the AI, we all have our views. It works better for some than I does for others.We usually budget €100 a day for the 4 of us, but we go AI but we normally only eat breakfast at the hotel and lunch if we happen to be at the hotel. We also make a point of eating our tea out."
"While I'm not cheap I am economical.I go to local shops and buy food for breakfast and lunches and go out to eat at night.Occasionally I'll eat lunch some where when the feeling is right.Greece is one of the least expensive places to travel to and you can eat very well at much lower costs than back home.A Gyro and bottle of beer will be around 5 euros. Many of my meals are in the 9-11 euro range, some even lower and that includes a 1/4 carafe of house wine.Obviously one can spend a lot of money going out to eat but you don't have to in Greece and still eat very well. The amount you budgeted will get your gourmet meals but you can spend far less and still eat as well if not better than royalty!Avoid the tourist places, search out where the locals go, buy local and you can have a Greek Experience rather than a Tourist Experience.Check out my photos of tavernas I've gone to and meals I've had all over Greece. Many were far less than 13 euros, mostly 9-11 euros with wine and/or beer.https://tinyurl.com/yyrqkp2xEdited: 4:44 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Thanks guys , much appreciated."
"Crazyh , just looked at your photos, the food looks amazing."
It tastes even better!If I can't make it to Greece this October I'll probably miss the food almost as much as seeing new parts of the country and meeting locals.
we used to spend about 100 a day but sometimes home with 30 depends where you eat but most are the same prices and that also includes drinks
"we like B&Bduring the day and lunch shop sandwich or sometime café sit in, maybe 25 euros totalDinner and pre and post drinks maybe 50 euros.So that's for 2 100 Euros will comfortably cover things from our perspective"
I will be booking as soon as this covid-19 is under control. Thanks for your replies everyone.
