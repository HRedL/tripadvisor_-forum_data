"What a situation? Anyone talking about it? And situation in airports... i have tickets in mid April, hope everything will be ok :)"
I don’t think anyone knows what the situation will be by the time you go. We are booked to go before you so will have to see how things go.
"According to this story in the Cyprus news hoteliers are on high alert:-https:/…The positives - No coronavirus cases in Cyprus so far. Number of tourists from Asia is very low. Cyprus does not have the capacity to host very large indoor events or conferences.If someone is tested positive the specific hotel will have to be quarantined for two weeks. I am in the same situation as Twigs, will have to wait and see as lots can happen in a month."
No one can predict what will happen in two months.
"We are booked for end of August, its a long way off and don't know what will have happened by then! I guess it will be everywhere very soon so there won't be any avoiding it."
"I'm also going soon, on the 25th March for a week to the Atlantica Golden Beach in Paphos, taking my Mother for a break, as we have just lost my Father. My Mother is very concerned."
"We shall be in Cyprus, as usual, for about five months this summer. Looking forward to it."
We. have booked 14 nights mid April and really looking forward to the trip. I do feel somewhat concerned being in 70s and have medical conditions.From what I read they have no cases in Cyprus at present.
Jeanette D I really hope that this virus can be contained and that Cyprus stays free of the virus. I hope that it works out well for your holiday with your mum. It sounds like a much needed holiday.I will be there at the same time as you all being well.. I have relatives going on Saturday.
"TwigsOxford, thanks, yes it is a much needed break, my Dad has been in hospital very ill for 5 months, had I should say. Yes, I hope Cyprus stays virus free too, have a good holiday too."
"I hope everything works out Jeanette and Twigs. I am also flying on the same day, we are probably on the same flight Jeanette. I am staying in the Annabelle, fingers crossed."
"Thanks WelshTraveller, yes, flying from Cardiff. Crossed fingers, as you say."
"Same here, we are on the same flight. Lot’s of positive thoughts."
"Cyprus seem to be very proactive and keeping on top of things at present. Still no confirmed cases. A woman has been quarantined on the fifth floor of Limassol general hospital pending the results of tests for Covid-19 while another couple has been discharged after they showed no symptoms of the disease, it was reported on Friday.All three had visited the hospital on Thursday evening after a trip to northern Italy.According to Christos Nicolaou, general director of the state health services for Limassol and Paphos, “she had to go through the system and undergo exams.”The results of the tests are expected in the late afternoon.Regarding another woman who had been in contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus in Italy and who tested negative for the virus, Nicolaou said 14 days have elapsed since the incident and she would be discharged.State authorities will have a meeting later to decide on further measures.In the morning, the Press and Information Office published a website and a pamphlet with advice on the virus in English, Greek,Turkish and Chinese.It also has travel advice and information on hotels in Greek, measures to prevent coronavirus infection in schools (in English and Greek), guidelines for health professionals and advice for people who have been exposed to cases of Covid-19.Anybody who has questions or needs medical help is asked to call hotline 1420. For more info see https://www.pio.gov.cy/coronavirus/info.html."
Further info to that Twigs has given is the closing of 4 border crossings to North for 7 days
It has just been published that the lady concerned has tested negative.
Even when tested negative they are still quarantined in Presidential holiday home on Troodos for 14 days
"Good news so far then, for our trip at the end of Match."
"That is all very good Cylib. We fly out a few days after you Jeanette, all being well."
"Crossed fingers for everyone, have a good trip."
"I really do despair of the media hype.Someone in Wales (UK has 15 confirmed cases so far) is very worried and concerned about flying to Cyprus where there are no confirmed cases.Statistically you are more likely to catch it in Wales.You can cancel and lose all your money or you can go - those are your only choices. The only way you will get any money back is if the Foreign Office declares Cyprus to be unsafe to visit (highly unlikely) and then travel insurance will pay out.I have sympathy for people who are concerned but why stress about something over which you have absolutely no control.Frequent hand washing is your best bet wherever you are in the world.Finally, it's like a cold, nasty but far less life threatening than the flu or a bad cold - it's not Ebola."
"We will all have to wait and see. Who knows how it will develop in the next few weeks.I can understand people looking for information.Edited: 12:00 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"I can understand people looking for information too but a travel forum is not necessarily the best place for information on this type of issue.In this instance people are looking to share fears or ask questions, which no one on here can answer. All any of us can do is wait and see.I've just come back from a cruise, I'm going to Dubai at the end of March, Norway and Cyprus in July - there is no information anyone on here can give me and frankly even if they did I would check it with official sources..If the foreign office advises against travel to any of those places then I won't be going - if they don't then I will. Simple as that.Or people can choose to cancel of their own volition and lose their moneyThose are the options."
"Someone in Wales is concerned, because as she has just lost her Father, she is upset anyway, so any little thing is enlarged. Perhaps you could have a little bit more empathy."
"“Someone in Wales (UK has 15 confirmed cases so far) is very worried and concerned about flying to Cyprus where there are no confirmed cases Statistically you are more likely to catch it in Wales”  At the time the post was made, Wales had no confirmed cases so the statement that you are more likely to catch the virus in Wales was incorrect. I think everyone is aware of the two options – either cancel and lose money or travel. I don’t think anyone is panicking but most of us are concerned about how this will develop in the next three weeks. I hope the number of UK cases doesn’t increase as there is a stronger chance of the virus travelling to Cyprus due to the high number of British guests.I can totally understand Jeanette’s concerns as travelling with an elderly parent is worrying plus a recent bereavement makes things worse."
"Yes I understand too but my point is that a forum is not the place to find information; you can share fears and get empathy but the only proper source of information is the Foreign office.I too have an elderly parent who is freaking out with worry because there is one patient in the isolation unit at Royal Liverpool hospital and we live in Liverpool, 9 miles from the hospital.The media don't have Brexit to whip up anymore so they have moved on to Corona virus.A sense of perspective is what is required.1. No one knows what the situation will be three weeks from now2. If British people who already have Corona virus travel to Cyprus then yes, the risk will increase in Cyprus for everyone else.3. 1 person, who caught the virus in Asia has sadly died. Over the last 12 months 14,000 people in the UK have died from flu - where were the posts about cancelling holidays during the last 12 months ?And my statement about being more likely to catch the virus in Wales than you are in Cyprus is true. There are no cases in Cyprus and the number would have to rise to higher than the 19 confirmed cases in the UK for the statement to be untrue.The point of posting on a forum is to get information, none of us can give any information. Jeanette has shared her fears and had responses - I wonder if she is any more reassured now than she was at 9am before the topic started ?I venture that she isn't and no amount of sympathy or empathy about her own personal circumstances will alter her fears or deal with her mother's worries..I have sympathy and empathy BUT I am not being anything other than a realist when it comes to questions that are impossible for any of us to answer."
I think we all know where to go for official Information but I don’t see anything wrong with discussing our fears with other travellers.I am more worried about being in the airport and on the plane than being in Cyprus at the moment. Although I would hate to be confined to a hotel room for 14 days even if it was a very nice hotel.As things are at the moment I am looking forward to my holiday and hope that it stays that way.
Well said..
Well said Twigs x
"So if it is OK to discuss fears then surely it is also OK to disclose facts ?Approximately just over 80,000 people are sick with Coronavirus, of which 77,000 are in China; so if you are not from China that’s 96% of your worries gone away.If you do catch the virus; 81% of the Cases are MILD, 14% of the Cases are MODERATE, and only 5% of the Cases are CRITICAL.The rate of mortality for people under 50 is 0.2%, so if you don’t live in China and are under 50 you are more likely to win the lottery.Take any given day since the virus began and compare the average death rate, which is probably around 130 with the numbers below. On an average day26,283 people die of Cancer24,641 people die of Heart Disease4,300 people die of Diabetes3,024 commit suicide2,720 people die as a result of a mosquito bite and 1,300 people were killed by other humansI too am looking forward to my holidays but on this topic I feel like the angel in the Cypriot fable. If facts and information don't allay peoples fears then maybe I should just stick to saying ""have a nice holiday"" and move on.Sorry for trying to deal with the fears and questions rather than just wishing everyone a nice holiday."
"Well said Latimer.We are off to Tenerife on Sunday and we are not concerned in the least, the media are loving this, and in the age of social media it is being blown out of all proportion"
My concern is we get to Cyprus and they say because of the number of cases in UK you need to be put in isolation. Then no holiday because the whole time your stuck in isolation.
"Ok, lets say they put you in isolation, then what do they do with the other 100,000 plus that visit every month."
They are testing people from the countries with the most cases on arrival at the airport. We are not on the list yet. When are you going?
"This is from Cyprus news.Officials told a news conference that so far 1,343 travellers from high-risk countries were examined at the Republic’s two airports.An action plan has also been put in place and tested with the hospitalisation of eight suspicious incidents in the Nicosia and Limassol general hospitals, and Makarios hospital.All incidents were negative."
HiI'm going 22nd of April.
"For the time being, passengers from high risk areas ( UK NOT being one), are examined at the airport and if negative they continue their lives and trip as usual."
I hope that stays like that. I'm looking forward to my holiday and being constantly reminded about Covid-19 due to work and news is making me sick! I do worry about my older relatives but I just want everything to be OK and calm down. You know
My relatives are in Paphos at the moment having a very nice holiday and we are due to go at the end of March. You have a while yet Sam let’s hope things calm down before your holiday.
Hi TwigsOxfordWhat is the weather like in Paphos at the moment? Not thinking we are going to get way to way sunshine (tho that would be nice) just trying to work out what to take. We fly out (hopefully) week tomorrow.
I am not sure but it looks quite pleasant from my relatives photos on Facebook. They are back tomorrow so I will find out. We have always found it to be a bit mixed at this time of year. We go at the end of the month and hope for some sunshine by day but know that it will be chilly at night.
"ok thanks. Yes we will be taking layers as I have seen that the temperature drops but if we can get some sunshine and warmth during the day that would be good and enable us to get out and about to explore as it is our first time there (tho hubby did live there as a child prior to the war breaking out) so in laws have given us some places to try and seek out. We are staying outside Limassol so plan to go there on the bus maybe a couple of times, anywhere else you would recommend?."
I like the mountain villages such as Omodos etc. Also Lefkara and Kourion.When in Limassol visit the castle area and the new marina.
"ok thanks, will bear those suggestions in mind!!"

"Ttoli, we have no cases and we will not develop cases here on our own, obviously the virus will be brought to us and that's logic not scare mongering. As long as people travel, especially from countries with confirmed cases, the virus will be spreading and that's a fact not scare mongering."
Unfortunately Cyprus now has its first two confirmed cases.
"It was to happen sooner or later. One came from Milan and second 65 yr old from UKEdited: 12:05 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Just read the news here, as Cylib says was bound to happen sooner or later:-https://in-cyprus.com/coronavirus-two-patien…Not good. ☹️"
The 64 yr old is a doctor in a hospital! Came back from UK and went back to work for 4 days. Will see what comes of it.
"I know, it’s worrying. As the cases are increasing in the U.K. every day there is a stronger risk of UK travellers bringing the virus to Cyprus."
"But the virus is already in Cyprus .... see the post above at 52.It isn't just UK travelers that increase the risk. If the virus spreads in Cyprus then the doctor with the virus who went back to work for 4 days will have something to do with it and so will allowing flights from severely infected destinations (i.e Italy), which seems to be the source of the second case.I will just repeat the probability.14,000 people have died from flu in the last 12 months in the UKIf you are not from China and are under 55 you are more likely to win the lottery.It may be worrying but it is not a death sentence and it is not Ebola.Edited: 3:28 pm, March 09, 2020 "
Of all the doctors this is the Head cardiosurgeon of General Hospital! He visited daughter in Southampton and came back to work in the most sensitive post possible.
I think nobody wants to be the one to whom it happens to. Regardless of statistics. Because there is no guarantee that your case will be mild. But unfortunately some people are idiots and there's no cure for that...
"“But the virus is already in Cyprus .... see the post above at 52”.Yes, I know that. I know that travellers from other European and worldwide countries will increase the risk but as cases are increasing in the U.K. there is stronger possibility that UK travellers will bring the virus to Cyprus. “I will just repeat the probability”.I agree with your stats but there are other things to consider. E.g. Travellers with pre existing medication conditions are at greater risk, flight concerns, possible quarantine, extra expenses, insurance implications & overall enjoyment as some people may worry or feel uncomfortable with the situation. “and so will allowing flights from severely infected destinations (i.e Italy), which seems to be the source of the second case”.I totally and that’s a massive problem. Airlines are still flying from the U.K. to Northern Italy which is madness.“I think nobody wants to be the one to whom it happens to. Regardless of statistics. Because there is no guarantee that your case will be mild”.Totally agree. Being ill is horrible but I would imagine it’s worse in a foreign country.Edited: 4:32 pm, March 09, 2020 "
In all honesty I'm more concerned about having my holiday cancelled. I know that seams selfish but I've been saving for over a year and it's been a pretty rough year. Last night I just sat and cried because of the situation.
"900 people infected with Corona virus as reported today, 800 tourist and 100 workers in a hotel found in Girne."
900 people where ?Reported where ?Are these confirmed cases and if so that makes Cyprus the most heavily infected region in Europe outside Italy.I doubt this very much.
900...nonsense.In ROC 2 infected but one was a doctor and all patients and hospital stuff being checked. First 50 were clear BUT strict measures announcedVisitors from Greece and UK must self confine for 14 daysAll athletic games with closed doorsNo gatherings of over 75 personsThe 4 border crossings remain closed
SamK I understand. We are also concerned about our holiday. We only booked this extra week in the Amavi as we lost over a week of our holiday in Limassol last September as we had to return home as my mother in law was taken Ill and in fact died just after we got back. We were looking forward to it and need a break but now fear that if we have as much as a cough or a sniffle we might not get there. We are also due to pay the balance on another holiday at the weekend!It is difficult.
"All schools in the TRNC has been closed down currently, it was reported this afternoon, there are pictures and post i took a screenshot of, i wish i can share them here"

"https:/…I suppose that this could be reversed again depending how things develop in the UK .Edited: 10:35 am, March 10, 2020 "
Yes the schools here in the North have been closed until 15th March
Uk visitors downgraded to Group 3 which is just self check for 14 days.Some schools in Nixosia will also close
"I'm currently staying in the Salamis Bay Hotel and we've been told today 10/03/2020 it's a 14 day isolation.It's chaos.No information, no food .... just 'go to your room'.I'd think very hard before I prioritise my holiday over this !"
Announcement regarding COVID-19 measures at the airport as posted on the Larnaca airport and Paphos airport official website.https:/…covid-19-info
"Why are they isolating you, UK was downgraded to group 3 ?"
James are they acting on the earlier decision to make Greece and UK group 2 which was for 14 days isolation? If so I am sure they will change this as UK are now group 3. Or do you have a suspected case in your hotel?
"I think the Salamis Bay is a hotel on the occupied side. I don't think they follow the same categories for arrivals as ROC does, so it is likely they also treat cases differently. For example they announced all schools to be closed early afternoon, while we had that announcement in the evening and only for listed schools in Nicosia not island wide.My kids are in a school which is closed now. The government made the announcement but there's no advice what parents are supposed to do - will this be a normal annual leave or unpaid or what. Some moves have not been considered well IMO. I think many people are reconsidering travelling. We had a trip coming in April to Poland but we decided to cancel. We are also booked to go to USA in July and we wait and observe because we have been saving for 2 years to be able to take our family of 4 for that trip and now we are facing loosing a lot of money."
"I have just seen in the news that it is a hotel in the North with a confirmed case.Edited: 2:50 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"which news, which hotel, we are due to fly out tomorrow, first 3 nights in Famagusta area !"
"Salamis Hotel.https:/…Edited: 3:16 pm, March 10, 2020 "
found it https://www.deccanherald.com/international/g…
thank you
"And some good news. The one positive case is a surgeon in Nicosia General Hospital and was working for 5 days. 152 people he had contact with-including family, patients and hospital staff- were all tested negative. So still those 2 cases"
There's nothing on .gov about self isolation or airport checks! I don't want to get stuck in a hotel room for 7 days and get told I can't go home for another 7! No communication from travel company about anything either. I just feel like crying again as you don't get a refund for if your even told to your in isolation
"@Sam K, UK is category 3 for Cyprus which is no isolation but self surveilance and if any suspicious symptoms occur stay put and call 1420. This is in case you were infected when in UK."
This is still not on .Gov where your told to look for travel information! Nor have I received an email or call from travel agents about thisThis is too stressful!!
"Most of the issue is a total lack of communication from any UK based, reliable sources.The government travel advice is not updated to reflect anything. People are feeling left in the dark."
"James S , the Hotel has an obligation to continue the board basis on which you originally booked (AI) ."
"At the risk of being told I am unsympathetic - again.There is more published information currently available on this virus than almost any other subject - the BBC has a live update facility minute by minuteThere are still far fewer cases in Cyprus than most of the rest of Europe and the UK is only 5th on the Europe list plus it has been moved to level 3 access for Cyprus.There is more communication on the subject than any other news item and thus has been the case for 10 days now.Poster at 82 and at 83.1 As of today you are able to travel freely to Cyprus and should be vigilant self isolating if you develop symptoms - for symptoms check numerous website2. If, and only if, the foreign office says “do not go to Cyprus” then you can cancel without lose3. If flights are cancelled and you have a package holiday you will get a refund. If you are flight only you will have the opportunity to rebook.4. I really despair of what you expect people on a forum, who are in the same boat as you to say.Unless you are physically prevented from travelling (by whichever means) then you have two choices1. Cancel your holiday which whilst disappointing will remove the stress or 2. Go on holiday and deal with whatever the reality is when you get thereNothing else anyone can say, however sympathetic they may be.We’ve all got holidays at stake and have a daily changing environment - stop crying and do some research.Cancel or accept what comes - you have no other options"
Information for the Northhttps:/…Charter flights refers to the RSD thread
"Hi,Sorry if I sound stupid but what is classed as a 'charter flight' I'm meant to be flying from Manchester to Ercan (Via Istanbul) on Saturday with Pegasus?"
"Ayse17 You'll be okay cnm, you are flying on a scheduled flight ie one that flies on a regular basis and Not a One off charter, 20 here today and bright sunshine , have a safe journey"
@Peter: Did you finally decide to fly? If you could share your experience at the airport.
"Phew - thank you for clarifying, already been moved to another hotel as was originally staying at the Salamis....."
Latest news. Four more cases in Cyprus:-https:/…
"There is actually a rumor circulating that we have 7 cases now. Not sure of it's true. From the 6 confirmed cases, none are related."
"Yesterday, 10 March, the Cyprus Government ordered that UK holidaymakers arriving on the island must go into self-isolation for 14 days. A few hours later there was a reverse ferret: we won't have to self-isolate but we will ""be asked to restrict movements to the absolutely necessary"".So our booked and paid for two-centre holiday with a hire car later this month doesn't look like it's a goer. Ah well."
"I too have a week long booking in the last week of this month. Since no flights are seem to be getting cancelled to Cyprus, it seems like a refund will not be an option.Now it is big risk of landing there and getting stuck in quarantine vs losing all booking money."
Any advice for friends and family travelling to Cyprus from abroad for Easter?
"We are travelling on Saturday and still awaiting confirmation, so i think it is too difficult to say what will happen in 3-4 weeks time, with the current situation."
If you get the corona virus before you go then you will not be able to travel anyhow and your holiday insurance will cover that. BUT I have always understood that if you have to cancel because of a medical reason you will need a medical note to confirm. Yesterday the Government stated if affected to self isolate for 7 days and not to contact 111. So what would happen then about getting your hard earned money back?
"If you have to self isolate or have restrictions on your holiday, it is not what you have paid for, so in theory the travel companies will have a lot of people asking for either another holiday or significant compensation. (rather than claiming on their insurance) I for one will be reviewing how my holiday pans out, if it is not cancelled at the last hour and will be contacting my holiday company to discuss my AI package!!"
"Hi, i am due to travel on sunday with Jet2, i have e-mailed the hotel we are due to stay at and they have confirmed the self isolation and that they are not accepting any guests from tomorrow until 31st march.Not heard anything from jet2, i will need to phone when i have finished work."
Is it just the north that’s banned Uk citizens? I have a holiday booked through Cyprus paradise to Famagusta and all they are willing to do is change the date...
I should have said we were due to stay in Paphos
"Got through to Jet2 and they have said flights and holidays are going on as normal!! They have said its only applicable in the North, which is clearly not true as our hotel in Pahos is not accepting any guests from the UK from tomorrow."
"Hi, can I ask which hotel you are booked to go to?"
"JulieW havent spoken to tui today but that has been their comment too, business as usual, we will let you know if anything changes.Worrying times and you wonder how much notice the travel companies are taking of the whole situation but you can only go with what they are doing or risk loosing all the hard earnt cash you have paid out!"
This is interestinghttps:/…
"Yes Suezi, worrying times, is it tomorrow you fly?Please let me know if you hear anything from TUI, thanks"
Yes Julie due to fly tomorrow @ 13:55 from Gatwick
Suezi good luck and do let us know what TUI says.We just had to cancel Athens for next week and rearrange that one and now looks like the same with Cyprus though we arent coming until May 5th.
"Jet2 have just announced they will not flying to Paphos and Larnaca with immediate effect, at least we will get a refund now"
"at least you know now Julie tho am sure you are disappointed that your trip has been cancelled Just checked Gatwick schedule and there are still 3 flights due out tomorrow (ours being the last) Easyjet and BA are due to fly out in the morning , I think there have been Easyjet flights going in and out for the last few days yet we haven't heard anything further on these so maybe some are getting through or just acting as transport services to get people back home (rather than having loads of holiday makers being self isolated in the airport) who knows..Edited: 9:55 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Just saw on Tui Facebook that they have cancelled all flights to Cyprus, up To and including 28 marchhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php…Edited: 10:25 am, March 13, 2020 "
oh am waiting on the phone to speak to them at the moment as we are due to fly tomorrow. I guess with that comment we are on the list for them to call ..
"i so need this holiday, been looking forward to it for months but would rather be here than there in the current circumstances.Just need to get hold of Tui to confirm my cancellation then and refund and then onto Premier Inn to cancel or reschedule our room which we booked @ Gatwick for tonight. Now I wonder if they will give me a credit or just say tough...."
"Yes, Suezi i agree, also was looking forward to getting away, as we lost my Dad last month, after a long illness in hospital. We needed to recharge our batteries. Do we need to get in touch with our insurance company? Do you think?"
"28th March. I cannot really see things getting any better here by then, and obviously from Cyprus point of view they want to stop visitors re infecting them. Blinking China has a hell of a lot to answer to!!"
Is this for all flights to Cyprus or only the ones from UK? We have a booking for next week with Ryanair from Budapest. Not planning to go but a cancellation from their end will get us our money back.
Hope that you get it all sorted Suezi. I was really looking forward to trying the new Amavi but in the circumstances I would rather be at home. It will be better for Cyprus and I hope that by September we may be able to return.
"Really agree with you KingMike,!!"
"Jeanette , travel insurance for what? I would imagine that tui will give you full refund (or replacement holiday) so what would you need to speak to TI for?"
"Hi, thanks for the updates - where did you see Jet2's announcement ?"
"Maggie have a look at post 31 on the other thread below this one. It has the Jet2 information.Also Mark posted the message that a friend of his received, also on the other thread."
"Hi, just wondered if I needed to inform insurers that I wasn't going on holiday"
"not sure Jeanette, wouldnt hurt to call them to let them know but you might end up in a long queueFor us, we have annual insurance so its not like we took the policy out for this holiday. But like I said, might be worth letting your TI know if you did book the insurance for this specific trip"
Thanks Suezi
"I was due to travel to Paphos from Birmingham tomorrow and, in an interesting plot twist, I have just received an email from TUI saying they are sorry that my holiday has been cancelled and I may be able to claim on my travel insurance - the implication being that I cancelled the holiday, which I haven't. There is no mention of an alternative holiday offer or a refund, which is what TUI are claiming they are offering in responses on their Facebook page. I am hoping that this is just an inappropriate communication by staff under pressure, and not an attempt by TUI to weasel out of providing a refund. In either case, it is very poor and receiving an email like that would be extremely stressful and confusing for someone who had not been keeping up to date with the Cypriot government's travel restrictions and their implications for UK travellers. I have not been impressed with TUI's handling of this issue, Jet2 seem to have managed things much better.Thanks to all contributing to this thread for your good information and I hope we all get to return to lovely Cyprus soon under happier circumstances!"
"Hi, I received the same email, when I rang my local Tui store, they said it was a standard email they send out, and that she had my money ready for refund when I bring my Debit card down tomorrow, so don't worry, I thought the same lol."
Many thanks for the reassurance Jeanette! I booked mine online so I guess it will take a while to work through the system. It would be very confusing though for someone who hadn't been keeping up to date with developments to get an email like that out of the blue.
That's a relief Jeanette - thanks. I was travelling on the same flight as you but I booked online. I am waiting for a cancellation notification from TUI. I have tried to phone them but it's impossible to get through. TUIs communication sounds terrible and very stressful for both of you - how awful.
Please keep us posted Marianfitzwalter.Hope you receive your refund soon and thanks for sharing your experience. Very stressful.
"I received a message from Mercury holidays to tell me THEY have cancelled my holiday and can rebook or take a refund ...... so relieved, message was at 17:30, check your emails everyone !!!!!"
"Yes, I agree, I thought when I received the email, oh great, I have to deal with the insurance company now!!! It would have been the last straw really, as I lost my Father last month, and this break was for my mother and I to recharge our batteries, after my Dads long illness.Edited: 2:48 pm, March 13, 2020 "
I am causing TUIs phones to be red hot Jeanette - I am like a dog with a bone! lol! Please keep me updated & good luck!
"Good luck with getting through Welshtraveller, I'm like that, you won't beat me lol."
Thank you Jeanette - Have a good weekend!
"Thanks all for the support. Yes, I will update as I am sure people with bookings a bit further away will want to know what to expect. I am also thinking that although we are all gutted to miss out on our hols, there are many people on the island who rely on tourism for their livelihoods and the impact on them will be devastating. I have just had the sad task of cancelling my bookings for the various tours I was planning to take, all with small locally-based companies, and I wonder how they will fare in the coming months."
"I totally agree Marian. The virus is a big financial problem for tourism all over the world. Must be very stressful to work in the tourism sector at this present time.Edited: 3:08 pm, March 13, 2020 "
I am due to go 4th April and got an email from sunshine.co.uk today to say the holiday had been cancelled an I would be refunded. I checked with Ryanair as I asked for a refund for the extra cost of paying for bags and they said they were still flying so won't refund.I am not sure anyone knows what's happening.
"Jeanette,If this is correct, it’s bad news for us:-https:/…affected-tui-holidaysHolidays planned after 25th March are running as normal at the moment. Please keep me posted."
"When I spoke to tui shop this afternoon she said to call down tomorrow for refund!! Hope it's still on for refund, as I read that Cyprus is shutting down till 30 March."
"Also my mother's 85, so don't want to put her in any danger."
The president announced new measures. For 15 days from 15th March entry to the island will be allowed only to: 1. Cypriots 2. Those who legally reside and/or work in Cyprus 3. Diplomats 4. Students and 5. Those who may have to come for unavoidable business if they receive permit from ministryIn addition WHO declared Europe as the epicenter of the outbreak. I expect mass cancellations of flights. Some other countries like Czech and Poland have closed borders and declared states of emergency. So not only you may face not being allowed to enter Cyprus but also you won't leave your country in the first place.
Thank you. Just noticed this information as it’s on the BBC website.
"HiMe again - not to be unsympathetic but just to reiterate that official sources are the only reliable information. We can all post on forums all day (and I include myself in that) but all the stress and worry and hours on phones trying to get through or ask questions no one can answer has come to naught because someone else has cancelled all visitors to Cyprus for at least 15 days and therefore you are getting a refund or the option to re-book. This 15 days will, in my opinion (but it is only my opinion), turn into a lot longer, especially as the official attitude in the UK is to extend the viral curve.Jeanette - very sorry for your loss and the stress you have gone through but you will get all your money back now as someone else has cancelled the holiday. The main thing for you must be to keep your mum safe and well so I wish you all the best and hope you get away somewhere lovely later this year.Welshtaveller - you and I have been forum friends for years and I follow your trip reports all round the world but why are you suggesting that there is bad news for Jeanette when TUI had already confirmed her refund. Furthermore, why are you asking someone that has already been through the wringer to keep you informed via a post on a travel forum ??With the greatest respect to you, you should keep yourself informed.At the risk of repeating myself - official channels are the only way to monitor this and posts with links to official channels are useful. TUI will keep you informed if you are flying with them, Easyjet if you are flying with them and so on. Everyone reading this is obviously capable of using the internet so sign up to Cyprus News website so you know what is happening and then wait for your airline or holiday booking agent to get in touch with you - no point trying and trying to phone an agent that may be behind the curve.So for example you get through and they say ""our flights are operating as normal"" only to find that 30 minutes after the phone call you spent 2 hours trying to make the Cypriot government announces a lockdown, No flights can operate and then your agent will contact you.I work in insurance so to further reassure Jeanette you do not need to contact your travel insurer and I wouldn't even try - their phone lines are as jammed as the airlines. I really do get how sad/frustrating/soul destroying and downright horrid this entire situation is and I have sympathy for everyone but please lets all take a little bit more personal ownership and deal with our own situations through official channels on an ever moving scenario.Yesterday there were football matches, today there are none.You could fly to Madrid on Wednesday, today you can'tTrump left the UK out of the Europe ban, tomorrow he won't1. If you decide to cancel then you will lose the money2. If you wait it out and someone else takes that decision out of your hands then you won'tIf we get through the epidemic in the UK and come out the other side thinking ""damn I lost a holiday"" then we will have had a good year.I am going to join Cylib in not making any further comments on the subjectI sincerely hope that everyone stays safe and well and that the only worries we all have concern the holidays we may have missed out on. Latimer"
"That’s very harsh Latimer. Firstly, Jeanette hasn’t received a refund as she is visiting her local TUI store today. The information on the TUI website changed last night and I wanted her to be well prepared just in case she experiences any problems today. Twigs has been extremely helpful and has provided lots of invaluable advice and support. She has been finding updates extremely fast. You have to remember that I have a life outside of the forums and some tasks like going to work are essential. I always try and find information myself via news sites and share details with others. The three of us (Jeanette, Twigs and myself) have been helping and supporting each other. It’s disappointing that your support hasn’t been as good. I totally agree with your last comment. I hope everyone stays safe and well."
Thanks WT I will always try to help anyone that I can with links etc. I knew that you were busy yesterday and as I am retired I had time to do it.I am also very sympathetic to Jeanette’s situation and try to be reassuring.I too would like to wish everyone well as that is the most important thing.
"Hi all, I am due to fly on 8th April with TUI.As of the latest information this flight is still scheduled ( although I do expect it to be cancelled) To keep up to-date I have registered on the UK GOV site and am now receiving E-mails as and when the official position changes. Last update was at 00:15 this morning . Probably worth registering if you want keeping up to date."
"Thanks everyone, Latimer, on this forum we are all in the same boat,and are being supportive of each other, whilst I appreciate your wishes re my holiday, I also think you are being harsh towards Welshtraveller, as she is very busy working, whilst I am at home caring for my Mother. And I haven't had my refund yet, because as know, information changed very quickly, so what they said yesterday night not be applicable today I will inform aEveryone when I have returned from m the Tui shop.Edited: 6:02 am, March 14, 2020 "
"I appreciate everyones input as we are all in the same boat on this journey. I suppose in any forum you will get those who think they know everything, those who try to put others down and those who do the I'm not commenting anymore brigade.But for me it is good this thread is going as it does help. Already it has pointed me towards some very good sources of info like the TUI FB page and the GOV Site with regular updstes.We were really looking forward to having our holiday in May but the way the UK have gone opposite experts from all around the world this is when they are now forecasting the peak of the virus. Obviously we would like to rearrange something so we can have something else to look forward to but must wait so there will be no financial penalties."
"Yes KingMike i agree, this site has been very helpful and informative. Helped me keep my feet on the ground, as I was starting to worry, especially as my Mother's 85, a young 85 granted, but still. Hope everything goes well for your May holiday."
So pleased that you got your refund Jeanette. Let’s hope that it works out well for all of us. I don’t envy the holiday companies at the moment.
"There has just been another email update from the GOV Site, but is anyone else finding it hard to work out what has been added to the situation when going on the site?"
Looks like same message as this morning
Great you got your refund Jeanette.We are in the same boat as you KingMike1 - due to go to Paphos with TUI in May. We just had to cancel our Athens trip for next week but were able to rebook for October.Worrying times for all of us!
Excellent news Jeanette & thank you for your support. I hope everything works out well for everyone. Stay safe all.
"Thanks Twigs, hope everything goes ok for everyone too. Yes I agree i don't envy holiday companies, and poor hotels and shops and restaurants abroad. Thanks Bronia, very relievedNo problem Welshtraveller, glad to help, yes stay safe all."
HiWe are due to fly out 25 march to paphos on a package with tui. Thought it had been cancelled but when I went in my local tui shop this morning informed that only applies to flights up to 24th! When I get home I read officially on gov.uk website no uk nationals are allowed entry into Cyprus for 15 days from 1am 15th march! Come on tui give me a true answer!
Hi Jeanette When were you flying? We are due to fly to paphos on a tui package 25th march. When I went into my local tui shop this morning I was informed the cancellations only up to 24th march.!!! When I get home the official gov.uk website says no entry for uk nationals from 1am 15th march for 15 days!! I just want a honest answer from tui. Be interested to hear how you went on ?
"We were flying on the 25 March with Tui, when I rang yesterday they were saying that they were cancelling holidays up to to 28 March, but after my phone call they said up to 24th March. So as I rang when they were cancelling up to 28th they kept their word and have me a refund. Hope that makes sense? (And helps?)Edited: 2:34 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"""Gave"" me a refund not have"
"All people arriving in Cyprus must self-isolate for 14 days, except for those coming from Italy, Iran, South Korea and Hubei province in China who will be quarantined.New announcement as of 14th March 8pm"
"Sheila,I am in the same situation, I was flying from Cardiff on 25th March on a TUI package. I booked online.When you visited your TUI store they were probably looking at the following website which says all holidays upto the 24th March are cancelled but holidays on or after 25th March are currently operating as planned.This was updated today - Saturday 14th March at 10.01am. https:/…affected-tui-holidaysI have some good news. This website:-https:/…tui-coronavirus-information…… which was updated later in the day (Saturday 14th March @ 5.12pm) says:- ""Due to restrictions introduced by the local authorities in Cyprus, we’re sorry to advise that all holidays to Cyprus departing up to and including 28 March have unfortunately had to be cancelled. We are proactively contacting affected customers departing between 16 and 28 March to find a suitable alternative holiday"". I would go back to your TUI store and refer them to the second link. It's very confusing and the conflicting information on the two websites doesn't help. I will hopefully receive my e-mail soon. Please keep us posted.Jeanette - You were very lucky. Glad everything worked out well."
"Welshtraveller, yes I think I caught them at the right time, before they put up second message saying only up to 24th March!!At least one thing comes out of being Google mad lolHopefully you will hear very soon, as it's getting worse, both Spain and France have now had a lockdown.Edited: 4:48 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Perfect timing Jeanette. TUI shouldn't change the goal posts, once they announce the dates via twitter they shouldn't go back on their word. The two websites with conflicting information adds to the confusion. Enjoy the rest of the weekend and start planning your next holiday (not with TUI!) when the virus disappears. Let's end on a positive!"
"I will Welshtraveller, thanks. Good luck with hearing quickly, let us know."
"I am here now on a package holiday with Tui, I received a text from them today to say that they will fly us home on our planned departure date, which for us is the 22nd. This evening there are rumours in our hotel that the hotel is closing down on the 25th. On our reps desk is a message to say that the reps are in a meeting tomorrow morning and will be back at our hotel at 11am so hopefully we will know more then."
"Good luck Ethansnan, I hope you hear good news tomorrow. It must be very worrying out there."
"The Republic of Cyprus government has announced stricter measures from 0100 local time on 15 March for those entering Cyprus. UK nationals (and other non-Cypriots) will not be permitted to enter the Republic of Cyprus for tourist purposes. UK nationals may enter if they are legal residents in the Republic of Cyprus, working in the Republic, attending educational institutions in the Republic or, with prior authorisation from the Cypriot government, have unavoidable professional obligations. This policy will be in force for 15 days, when it will be reviewed."

Hi Welsh travellerThankyou for that hopefully I will get a phone call in the morning! I just hope they will refund as at this moment in time I really do not want an alternative holiday!!
"Hi Sheila,Did you book online or in a TUI store? Most TUI stores are closed on a Sunday. If you booked online it’s extremely difficult to contact them by phone due to the high call volumes. If you booked in store I would visit the store asap and refer them to the second link in my original post. They will have to provide a refund as TUI is cancelling the holiday.Please let me know how you get on and good luck."
"Great news Welshtraveller, about time. You can relax now. From now on I think I'll keep on booking in the Tui shops, as they did price match it anyway."
Great news WT.I hope that we will hear from Jet 2 at some point.
"Hi Twigs, crossed fingers for you, hopefully you'll hear tomorrow."
New restrictions in place as from 16/03/20 18:00 :https:/…
Twigs - Hope you receive your refund soon. Jeanette - Stay in touch.
Good news. I have just phoned my tui local store where I booked and will give me a full refund when I go in tomorrow.
"I got cancellation notification from Jet2 yesterday, full amount to be refunded"
"Good news Sheila A, big relief. Julie W, great news, breath again now. Good luck everyone."

"3-5 working days is a standard process time, whenever banks are involved."
"This thread has turned into a pot of sympathy for those who wait for refunds...perhaps it would be better to open a separate thread about refunds and leave this one for important information so travelers who still take trips to Cyprus can get an up to date advice without having to scroll through 18 pages?Important information added by Popperchops, those who are still allowed to enter Cyprus must present certificates that they have tested negative for coronavirus.The entry requirement will come into force on March 16 and will be remain in force until April 30. All arrivals will be subject to mandatory 14 day quarantine at facilities selected by the state."

"@marianfitzwalter With respect, my comment was based on my experience of what some people do not know, not on what you think that everyone knows."
I appreciate that everyone has a different opinion about what is important and not. Providing the overall topic relates to the virus there is enough room for everyone’s comments. Julie & Shiela - Great news....let’s end on a positive!
"@sinnayis, I think that lovely comment was directed at me not you ;) @marianfitzwalter, the subject is not ""refunds due to corona virus"" so I will continue to add information on the original question of OP which was ""what's the situation"" because obviously OP asked about situation on coronavirus and not situation on refunds."
"@marianfitzwalte, inappropriate posts will be reported and removed. Show some respect"
"Just to let anyone know, I called in Tui shop Saturday for a refund, and was told it would take anything from 7 days to 28 days to receive, but it was in my bank account today. Very surprised and pleased it was done so quick. Hope everyone is the same."
"Mine said 3-5 working days, that was on Friday, still not received anything yet."
"Jane C, you'll probably hear soon, crossed fingers"
"Hi, i have just checked and Jet2 have only put £120 into my account?Anyone had their money back from them?"
"Jeanette - That’s brilliant. I received my refund today as well. I only received notification of the refund on Sunday, Very impressed, well done TUI. Julie - Was the £120 a deposit? Did you pay the remaining balance on another card? If so, check that card as well. Good luck."
"Checked and had paid all with the same card, called Jet2 and have been told the rest should be in my account tomorrow"
That's good Julie.

"Just the latest update from Gov.UK incase anyone has not seen yet.Still current at: 18 March 2020 Updated: 18 March 2020 Latest update: The Republic of Cyprus government has instructed all hotel and tourist accommodation to cease operations by 21 March, and to remain closed until 30 April. ('Summary' and 'Health' pages)The Republic of Cyprus government has instructed all hotel and tourist accommodation to cease operations by 21 March, and to remain closed until 30 April. The government has stated that all tourists will need to leave their accommodation by 21 March. Some hotels may close before 21 March. The British government is discussing this requirement with the Cypriot government and asking airlines to offer more flights. We recommend that British nationals who wish to leave Cyprus contact their travel operator to make arrangements to do so as soon as possible."
"Hi, just to update the remainder of my refund is in my account today from jet2, have to say their customer service and prompt refund has been an amazing in the circumstances."
Still not got mine from Tui!
We are still waiting for our refund from Jet 2. They are working through in date order apparently. We were due to go on 27th.
TUI is allowing holiday amendments without change fees now. All well and good but when I looked to rebook Amavi it was the only hotel saying not available - and that was right up to next May.
