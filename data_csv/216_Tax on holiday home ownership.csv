I'm not a French resident nor do I have any French source income but am interested in purchasing a holiday home in France.I have an area selected and a number of properties selected in this area however I am trying to get an idea of what taxes I would have to pay each year after purchase. Is there any website that I can enter in information into a form and get a clear and exact breakdown of the ongoing taxes and charges levied on holiday home ownership by foreign residents for a specific property?Thanks.
"Hi. A lot of info here https:/…Sorry, it’s in French but you can copy-paste the article and ask google to translate if needed ;)"
"Thanks. I have read a few articles that have explained what taxes are due however now I want to take a specific property that is listed for sale and calculate the exact amount of each tax and charge I will have to pay per year for the Taxe Foncière, Taxe d’Habitation, ect."
"The taxe d'habitation is increased by 60% in the case of secondary home. To know the basic amount you would have to ask the agency, seller or local mairie as each property is charged on the basis of what is called its rental value (valeur locative) and the financial and family situation of its occupants. You also need to be aware of the capital gains tax payable on sale (taxe sur la plus value). If you intend renting as a holiday let there are tough rules about that too."
Appreciate the replies. That sounds unnecessarily complicated but I'll get to the bottom of it;)
"There are many things in France that are unnecessarily complicated, but whizzkids who come out of elitist educational establishments such as ENA have to justify their existence somehow, by inventing silly complicated rules. There is a motto over here which says ""Why do things simply when they you can make them complicated"" (Pourquoi faire simple quand on peut faire compliqué)."
"There is also a tax on unoccupied apartments. In fact, I received a payment request this year due to an administrative error. Actually two errors -- I had not received the residence tax (""taxe d'habitation"") to they decided there was no resident and sent me the other tax. It just took a couple of emails to clear it up, but now I know that there is a vacancy tax. I think it doubles every year that an apartment remains unoccupied.Keep in mind that tradeform is just a typical curmudgeon. A certain percentage of the French like to complain about everything and anything, even when they have no specific example of what they are saying (unlike me!).Edited: 11:37 am, June 29, 2020 "
"I have a holiday home that is defined as such, a non-resident and I only pay tax habitation and tax foncière. It is a townhouse on a dedicated holiday estate, so regulations may vary from property to property. The calculations are complicated and based on size on property and plot. There is even a relief of what used to be the tax professionelle when doing holiday rentals. The only way you can find out is by asking the agent what the current owner is paying. This can be a hit and miss if the current owner has underdeclared. Before any sale the house/apartment living space is measured and tax is based on this. My tax went up after I declared the extension. Make sure any building works have work permits and are declared. There is plenty of monkey business in that area."
And I believe some tax rates vary from commune to commune.
"You also need to check whether you will be liable to pay tax on it in your country, either a property tax or a tax on the received rental, or, indeed, both."
Tax on rental and equity is usually taxable in the home country.
Appreciate all the helpful replies. It is good to have all the info (or as much as possible) before making such a big decision and good to have a good bit of knowledge before speaking to a local professional when dealing with foreign property transactions.
"Be careful, lots of crooks in the property business in France. Get independent legal advice, independent surveys etc."
Fair few of them here too;)
"They are everywhere, and just like Covid-19 you need to protect yourself from those pathogens!"
I confirm that lots of the real estate agents will reassure you that absolutely everything you want is permitted or exempted. And they will be long gone if you get in trouble.
"I wouldnt bother with an independent estate agent at all. I would contact the local notaire and do everything through them. At least that way you will be able to contact them, unlike estate agents who are usually unqualified amateurs who spend all their time ignoring the phone.Mind you, that's only my experience..."
Notaires cannot be trusted either.
"It ought to pointed out that in these specific dealings, it is not necessarily because they are crooks, but because 99% of their customers are French residents if not French citizens. So they just don't have the experience of dealing with a foreign buyer and any special rules concerning them.As for the agents specialized in foreign buyers, these are the ones that I would avoid like poison, because they will always tell you exactly what you want to hear."
"** lots of crooks in the property business in France **That is so true. Unfortunately, that's the nature of the business and it goes beyond France (like a pandemic). It gets worse in the 3rd world countries where laws and regulations are nonexistent, absent, or speculative."
"When I read your post, I got the impression this is a vacation home for yourself, not that you'd be renting it out. If you do rent, your French income tax would be 20% on top of the other taxes already mentioned."
