"I booked a flight to prugue from tel-aviv for 19-22 march with smart wings.The flight was cancelled.like any decent travel agancy I was expecting a mail telling me not to worry and that I can have a voucher, instead I received nothing from you, even after I sent you an email more then a month ago.The new info on your website about coronavirus doesn’t say anything about a voucher or a refund within acceptable time.The minimum I expect is a simple email saying sorry and that you offer me a voucher.Please don’t refer me to your website, don’t ask me so send an email again, don’t tell me that you prioritize answers based on flights (because my flight was cancelled more than a month ago).Just send a simple email saying sorry and that you offer me a voucher or a refund.If you still want people to book with you , this is the minimum you have to do."
"There are dozens of threads about Travelgenio in here already. You'll just have to wait, there are thousands of customers in the same situation as yourself and the agent obviously do not have the manpower to deal with them in a timely manner."
100 other threads here about this company. All the questions you are asking are answered there.Next time research before you give away your money and avoid companies that have complaints here going back many years
Why did we need to have yet another travelgenio thread - those who are silly enough to book with them in the first place are also silly to think that their problems will be solved by having their own personal thread.Don't worry the bot will be along shortly to assist with your woes.
"Travelgenio is based in Spain, they have fewer staff than usual working at a time of unprecedented demand.This is the flip-side of using an agent because you believed they had the cheapest ticket prices - everything else, including customer service, becomes an optional extra and is provided at the most minimal level possible."
">> like any decent travel agancy <<but they are not a decent travel agency, they are an online ticket flogger...a tiny amount of research before giving them your money would have alerted you to this...it is not a new thing, there are many threads going back many yearsWhat Travelgenio can get for you depends on what he airline is offering. In the case of smartwings (according to their website) this is ""If your flight is cancelled, you can change your reservation to a later date free of charge thanks to our no rebooking fees policy"" however as you chose not to book directly with the airline you will need to deal with your chosen middleman (based in Spain likely on lockdown with few staff) to manage this for you.There are many poor third parties. how many of them will survive is not known (same with airlines) but it is often the case that the savings offered by these ticket floggers is rarely worth the added complexities and fees should you or the airline make any changes. Randomly selecting the cheapest advert may not be the best approach. (I assume you chose not to book direct with the airline because TG advertised a cheap price)"
"Carol is right. Travelgenio are not even a travel agency in my book, never mind a good one. They are not good at customer service or support at the best times, and these are far from being the best of times.You can't just assume that because there's a website advertising cheap flights that they will be good to use. You have to research who you're handing your money to, or book direct.As for your final sentence, people will always book with Travelgenio and others based on price, just like you did. They know that, so why should they even attempt to be better?"
“If you want people to still book with you this is the minimum you have to do”That might be one of the funniest statements I’ve ever read. No they don’t have to do anything. Because people like you are going to book with them anyway. If you had an a minimum of research you would’ve seen that there are literally hundreds of post on this forum alone about how bad they are. But no you just handed over cash and now you think you can shame them into being a good customer service by pretending that people won’t book with them. Sadly the truth is people going to exactly what you did I just handover cash because there’s a cheap airfare ferry somewhere and you think you found it  There is no cheap airfare ferry and you just learned very expensive lesson. Book direct. There’s no need to go to anybody but the airline to book an airplane flight and if you’re booking a package vacation use a reputable agency. Finding a reputable agency requires that you do research before you give them your credit card number.
"They are not a ""Decent Company"". Hope you never book with them again. Don't hold your breath waiting for any voucher/refund. Next time research research research before you give anyone your $$$."
