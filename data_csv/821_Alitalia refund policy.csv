Can I get money back for flights from Miami to FCOJune 16-28.
"Their COVID-19 refund policy is outlined on their website. See below:https:/…info-flights.htmlEdited: 11:20 am, April 12, 2020 "
I got my refund for Boston to FCO originally scheduled for March 26th after 6 emails and finally getting through to a human at customer service.Good luck!
Why cancel? Just postpone or go if restrictions are lifted. I’m not cancelling end of July trip. Unless the airline and hotel cancel on me.
"#3--Amen to that! My next trip to Rome (I go every year) is slated for the first week of September and I'll be d***ned if there's any way I'm canceling from my end. Alitalia will have to cancel me-- which I 'm sure they will not if things are okay by then.When Roma begins her recovery she'll need her huge fan club more than ever to get back on her feet, and I intend to be there with my credit card at the ready.Edited: 11:23 am, April 16, 2020 "
"At this point you for June travel you can cancel and only get a travel voucher of equal price or change your flight to another date. If YOU cancel you will pay any cancellation fees but if THEY cancel, you can get a total cash refund and not just a voucher. My flight is June 18 and I'm waiting. If they end up not canceling flights in June and I still don't want to go, then I will give up the cancellation fee. May as well wait and take your chances than lock in any losses now."
I would not count on them cancelling flights in general given they are now still flying JFK-FCO at least three times weekly...sometimes more.
">>I would not count on them cancelling flights in general<<A quick snapshot right now:Airlines are cancelling about 85% of flights. 85% is not 100%, but the number of flights has been significantly reduced.Passenger volume is down even more - at least for US travelers. The current number of passengers is about 5% of the number from the same time last year. 95% fewer passengers!!!"
@7 i get that just saying that AZ happens to still be operating the route....DL is operating nothing on that route.
"""Why cancel? Just postpone or go if restrictions are lifted. I’m not cancelling end of July trip. Unless the airline and hotel cancel on me.""Exactly this!"
Today Alitalia cancelled its FCO-JFK flight 608. This is the first time since 9/11 that Alitalia had zero flights between Italy and the U.S.
have tried to figure out who exactly is on these planes? Maybe some necessary family travel that is about it. I noted they were down to about three days per week for some time here and even then why bother....other than to keep the slots at JFK?
"Actually, Alitalia has been flying once daily between FCO and JFK since late March, primarily to repatriate Italians studying and working in the U.S. There are large numbers of such Italians in New York, New England, California, Florida and Chicago. I presume that those Italians wanting to go back have left by now, thereby explaining the cancellation of today's flights. Obviously, there are no Americans flying to Italy, even those going for business reasons. The advantage of using widebodies for these flights is to facilitate seating people far apart. As a re-nationalized carrier, Alitalia no longer needs to worry about who will pay the bills and cover Alitalia's millions of Euros of yearly losses. This is socialism in its pure state!Edited: 5:29 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"'This is socialism in its pure state!'Highly debateable. Pragmatic nationalism might be a better description. The largest grouping in the current government, M5S, could on no stretch of the imagination be described as socialist.The rescue of what is still seen as the national carrier by many, including some politicians of the far right who would doubtless have feigned apoplexy had Alitalia been allowed to fail, is a messy short-term fix which is probably storing up much trouble for the future, as EU rules will not allow unfair subsidies (except, perhaps, at times of pandemics?).The current government's expressed aim is to slim Alitalia down to a fleet of less than half its current size, and then sell it on (or find someone to take it off their hands?). Whether they'll succeed, or be around long enough to be seen to fail, is anyone's guess."
"Alitalia is too small to be viable unless it is a part of a much larger enterprise, such as Lufthansa or Air France. However, there is no airline in the world which will be able to absorb even a much streamlined Alitalia, under current conditions, and for the foreseeable future. Nor will anyone be interested in buying any of Alitalia's aircraft. As for breaking the EU rules, no airline in the world will survive much beyond the middle of this year without massive state aid. Most of Europe's surviving airlines will become de-facto nationalized.Personally, I approve of Alitalia's nationalization, because Italy has a strategic need to have air transportation available, and there will be no ""market"" solution available for years to come."
"I agree that no-one will be interested in buying Alitalia. And any Italian government is likely to have massive difficulty in reducing Alitalia's costs so that is even remotely independently viable, even if (very unlikely) the opportunity is taken not to re-employ those currently laid off.. I do not agree that most of Europe's surviving airlines will necessarily become de facto nationalised. Some of the largest carriers claim to be able to survive a fairly long turn-down without direct government intervention - EasyJet, for example, reckons it can survive nine months of total grounding on its existing reserves and privately negotiated finance. And if some major airlines and airline groups survive without direct government finance (e.g. maybe EasyJet, Ryanair, the IAG group and Lufthansa?), the position of the remainder could become politically very interesting.If Alitalia were allowed to fail, Ryanair and EasyJet would probably be delighted to provide a market solution by varying their normally already extensive network of internal Italian flights. There is no 'strategic' need for Alitalia whatsoever, only the self-important 'need' of certain members of the Italian elite to travel first class rather than on single-class flights, and the 'need' of Alitalia employees to remain in work at uneconomic salaries.Edited: 7:05 am, April 18, 2020 "
Alitalia is not permitted to fail because it has direct impact on 50000 voters in Rome. Indirectly much more.
"Alitalia has already failed. The interesting question is how long the European Commission will permit Italian governments to keep a failed airline alive by providing state aid in contravention of EU competition rules.In the very short term, particularly because of the coronavirus crisis, that's not going to be a problem. But in the longer term, it most certainly is."
If other EU airlines go bankrupt Alitalia will survive the EU rules
"""Today Alitalia cancelled its FCO-JFK flight 608. This is the first time since 9/11 that Alitalia had zero flights between Italy and the U.S.""For how long of a time?"

"Interesting point Floriani, but in Rome and south the votes are much more. Any other company would settle in Milan. And the north could survive without Alitalia, it does already, the capital and the rest of Italy would be cut off, with some short range low cost airline. This must be considered too."
All Alitalia employees are from Rome or sorroundings
"Yes they are, Rome is the capital and the national carrier was based in the capital.Would any other international company settle in Fiumicino airport (capital and geographic center) instead of Milan?"
Companies settle where the passengers are.
"Companies settle where they have arisen historically, and where it is economical and legally convenient to locate their headquarters. Easyjet, for example, while it still has its group base where it was founded in Luton, 50 km north of London, now has many more planes registered with its subsidiary companies in Geneva and in Vienna than are registered in the UK. EasyJet and Ryanair (based in Dublin) together now already have as many or nearly as many Italian domestic flights as Alitalia in normal times, and have no difficulty running these flights without an Italian company.Any non-italian company taking over those of Alitalia's routes which can be made profitable would certainly need maintenance facilities for a hub at Fiumicino. But this would be no more difficult to establish than Ryanair's at Ciampino, and it would not need a Rome company HQ.Should a company find it politically and economically expedient to do so, they could anyway easily set up a new Italian subsidiary, for example following Ryanair's model in establishing Malta Air (not Air Malta) in Malta and Buzz in Poland, Ryanair subsidiary companies to which Ryanair planes are being transferred and rebranded. A deal like this in cooperation with an Italian government might possibly be managed so as to appear to preserve the unrealistic nationalist aspirations for an Italian flag carrier, and therefore avoid some of the loss of votes. Though it won't avoid much of the loss of jobs, which is now inevitable."
"Air France, British airways, Iberia, I think all national carriers settle in the capital, so Alitalia is settled in the capital for territorial reason.A foreign carrier, following the market rules, would settle in Malpensa, Varese. Just near the border to Switzerland. because there are more passengers. This is why the votes for a national carrier are so many. Of course, a market solution would be better. But it should be based in Rome, which is maybe less profitable for a potential buyer.A low cost as only choice seems a bit scary.Edited: 8:45 am, April 19, 2020 "
"Alitalia cancelled my flights from Rome to Frankfurt in early May. Immediately, upon receiving the cancellation notice, I responded to the email requesting a complete refund for both tickets. I followed up with a phone call to their Customer Service Dept. to ensure that I was in the queue for a refund. (Note: I was waiting over 30 minutes for someone to answer the phone.) After being assured that they had my refund request, I just waited. Finally, this week of July 28, 2020, the refund was posted on my credit card."
"I’m having same experience with almost same time line. I had 4 round trip flights cancelled from BOS-FCO and called and waited and finally talked with a call center in Albania. But I’m still waiting for a refund. It’s heartening to hear someone got there money back but not me, not yet"
