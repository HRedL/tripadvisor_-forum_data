"No issues, I traveled from Mexico to CA and back recently."
"Aguti,I'm a New Yorker (I live in NYC) and I have never heard of the mandatory self-quarantine after international travel for NYS. Can you please share the source of this info?"
I'm including a link from 2 news sources about the states that require a mandatory quarantine when you return...https:/…https:/…coronavirus-state-restrictions.htmlI'm also including the entry/exit requirements of Mexico for U.S. citizens. This is from the U.S. Dept of State https:/…
"Looks like many states have more requirements of people coming from the New York tri-state area than other countries. I guess that means make sure your flight doesn't connect through JFK, LGA, or EWR! :-)"
"Please keep yourself abreast in the current state of international affairs regarding the virus, Mike. Other U.S states are surging with COVID-19 cases while NY and NJ are continuously going down...Thank you..."
It does
I can't imagine they are quarantining all passengers connecting through JFK from MexicoWe are not even leaving the airport
"Our final stop is Boston, which has no mandatory quarantine."
"Cat, sorry I was trying to be ironic, sarcastic, and witty in the same post. I get told all the time at home to stick to my day job! What I was trying to same that if you fly into a place like Florida, the regulations are tougher for NYC-area people than someone arriving from Mexico or some other place that is far worse than NYC at the moment. Geographic-based restrictions made in March aren't that well founded in June."
"@Cat S: No Need to be rude. I stated in my message that it could have changed.Meaning I don't have the up-to-date concerns. It is just like how the State of New York is saying they want people from Florida to Self-Quarantine because of the recent spike in Florida.It has not been made official, but just so people are aware.We haven't seen a huge spike in New York yet because people aren't traveling to New York at this time."
"aguti013I wasn't being rude at all. I was just simply saying that I haven't heard of mandatory quarantine for NY and I wanted to clarify the information you gave...The only quarantine that I knew of was an issuance from the NYS Dept of Health stating quarantine was mandatory or precautionary if you traveled from Iran, China, Japan, South Korea, and Italy but that was it. This was back in Feb. I'm not sure why you are offended because I asked if you could share more info about what you said, but ok... Many people read these forums, so I like to help minimize the spread of inaccuracies and misinformation. Because I'm all about facts and not assumptions, here is the link to my source from the NYS Dept of Health. https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/travel-lar…Regarding the quarantine of Floridians to NY, Cuomo has said that he is thinking about it. No need for people to get worked up about things until it actually becomes a law on the books. I think it's almost payback for Cuomo since the Florida gov put the quarantine on NYers. Cuomo is my kind of petty and I love it, lol. Mike V...I apologize as I totally read it the wrong way. Please forgive your Northern ally, lol.Edited: 5:06 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"New York already got slammed unfortunately and now on the downhill slope finally. They were our Italy and Spain at the peak. It might be one of the safest states to visit. Similarly I would imagine France, Italy and Spain to be safest European countries."
"Also at the peak, New York was having 10,000 plus positive cases daily with about 25 to 30% of tests being positive. 20 million residents.Florida as a point of comparison has about 5.5% of tests being positive currently. 2700 cases yesterday. 30 million residents.Apples to apples."
Did you have to get tested for Covid-19 upon your return through customs in CA?
"HI,what was experience returning like?"
