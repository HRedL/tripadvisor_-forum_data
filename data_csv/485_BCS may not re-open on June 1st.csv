"The Mexican government has announced a four stage ""traffic light"" approach to re-opening activities based on COVID-19 levels. Each state is designated as one of four colored lights, red, orange, yellow or green, signifying the level of COVID-19 alert. Right now BCS is designated as the ""Maximum Alert Level (Red light)"" and the governor has announced that if that does not change by June 1st, current restrictions will remain in effect. The level of COVID-19 cases in BCS is designated as stable right now (not increasing or decreasing). If the alert level drops to ""High Alert (Orange Light), some non-essential activities could be allowed but at a restricted level. (Source: Cabo Mil News)"

"Seriously..if any one is really that worried call the consulate. Down here now, why so much doom? https:/…"
Diamante is open???
So what have you and the girls been up too? Is anything open?
"This is the very definition of an entitled douchebag. Mexico has asked you not to come, BCS has asked you not to come. Resorts have closed to try to stop you, and you go anyway. The link you posted for the State Department literally shows Level 4 DO NOT TRAVEL. They also say that if you ignore all of this, you’re on your own. You deserve every bit of scorn you receive."

"All the links to the plans announced by the hotels mean nothing if the health officials and the governor decide something else. What I posted is from an announcement from the government authorities yesterday. Believe it or not.I love the link that was provided in #3, which says that right now US citizens should not travel to any foreign country. I guess the poster knows best."
"The on-line newspaper, BCS Noticias confirms the report on Cabo Mil News:https:/…"
"Thanks for the update Eljefe. I am chomping at the bit to schedule a trip for July but am hesitant to do it until I get information on the lifting of the local government restrictions; including the driving restrictions. Call me skeptical, but opening dates from travel pages, hotels, or timeshare salesmen isn’t enough for me to book a trip.#probro #itscabotime!"
I take the Mexican news with the same open mind I digest the American news with. I’m sure some places will open later than others but I can promise you that all the Mexican people want is for US ( tourists of any sorts) to come back down. I have been speaking almost daily with local captains who say there is no issue or panic what so ever and everyone is ready to get back to work ASAP. Have had enough of this continuous doom and gloom. Do some real research and find out just exactly how “deadly” this Covid is compared to others.
"Seaorsnow, the news articles, quoting the governor not simply their opinions, say the the status of each state will be updated weekly. Decisions about re-opening each of the states will be made based on that new weekly information."
"Cabo Mil NewsLike This Page · 17 hrs ·  #NEWSBRIEF The Ministry of Health reports that BCS is marked as a red region in the newly announced COVID-traffic light, which will regulate the return to the “New Normality”, making it impossible to restart activities on June 1st. Based on this, State Governor, Carlos Mendoza Davis, reported through his social networks that, if everybody works responsibly, stands in solidarity and reduces risks, we may have a reopening date.Governor Mendoza emphasized that the return to regular activities depends on everyone, hoping that citizens show their support to reduce the number of infections by complying with the sanitary measures established by the authorities and maintaining social confinement.The newly announced COVID-19 traffic light will regulate the return to the ""new normality"" in Mexico and will go into effect on June 1. This means that the return of states and municipalities to economic, social and cultural activities will be determined, following the status of each state and municipality. Based on the traffic light, the date and mitigation measures will be designated: it will operate by region and will be updated weekly. The traffic light consists of four colors: red, orange, yellow and green. The following conditions will be evaluated based on this color-scale:The status of open air and closed public areas.Public health and work safety measuresThe allowed activities, whether essential or non-essentialThe situation of people with vulnerability conditionsSchool activitiesToday, during this morning’s press conferences of both President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and the Ministry of Health, it was announced that the authorities will issue weekly updates regarding the color that each state is in and, accordingly, specific measures will be followed. Specific activities and conditions apply to each color on the COVI-19 traffic light code.Areas marked as Red will only allow essential activities. Noting that as of June 1st three new sectors will be added to the essential activities list. The three new sectors are; mining, construction, and transportation manufacturing.Areas marked as Orange will allow Non-essential activities in reduced numbers. Activities in public spaces may restart, also on a limited basis. Vulnerable people may be integrated into work activities with the utmost care. Meaning that there will be protocols to reduce their work-hours and designate specific areas for them.Areas marked as Yellow will allow all work-related activities without restriction. There will be minor restrictions in open-air public spaces with greater restrictions in closed public spaces, such as cinemas, restaurants and theaters. Schools, however, will remain closed.Areas marked as Green may return to normal activities including the reopening of schools.By: Claudia Velo for Cabomil News https:/…"
"This shouldn't come as a surprise. I don't know why people held onto the idea of June 1st reopening so strongly, as if they haven't pushed back re-opening dates before. Don't forget Mexico was one month behind US, so they may not open until one month after US. I'm dying to get out of town too, but it just doesn't make sense for me to book anything until I see them open."
"Eljefe, sorry for the confusion. I was referring to other posts/threads quoting hotel or travel pages stating opening dates. I always appreciate your posts referencing news sources. What I was trying to get at was, I am not comfortable booking a trip until local restrictions are officially relaxed."
"Seaorsnow, my clarification that the news article was quoting the governor of BCS rather than just being an op-ed was directed at #11 that didn't necessarily believe Mexican news. That information was also shown in the governor's social media. Honestly, I would have been really surprised and concerned if the local authorities didn't take COVID-19 levels into consideration when planning the reopening of their economy."
"El Jefe make NO mistake news is just that NEWS. I already know which side of the fence you stand on in the fact you can’t refer to the President as such, so I guess a comparison to the absolute crock of crap news you listen to here in the states isn’t worth it.Covid 19 was driven by the media and the left , period. As I’ve said 10 times actually look into the seldom less reported or NON reported Facts about the actual virus. You have posted NOTHING but articles that are doom and gloom and don’t represent what is actually going on in America OR Cabo. Cabo WIlL open soon and it yes I will agree it will most likely open in phases due to the huge media push to make headlines with doom and gloom “news” and scaring everyone out of their minds. I speak to people there daily and just like here in the US , the Mexican people are ready to get back to work and tired of the media’s games and inaccurate reporting just to create “news”.I dare you to post something positive."
"haynie ~ it is unclear to me which non-reported facts you'd like folks to consider. Is it possible to share a link to those non-reported facts, or if there is a link, does that make them reported facts?"
Everyone decides which flavor of kool-aid they want to drink. I was hoping to go in June but now my wife is going back to work in about a week (dental hygienist). Never would have thought they would allow that so soon.We can’t hide until there is a vaccine and the hospital system that I work for has plenty of surge capacity so why are we still hiding? My wife is allowed to clean teeth but it’s too dangerous to go to a restaurant? You can’t make up this stuff!

"Jefe - this thread is beneath the Los Cabo forum. Don’t give h* any more of a platform. That said, Cabo, other resorts and the US are opening. It’s up to us to practice etc to make it work."
"I have been going to Cabo for 25 years. I have many local friends down there who are all out of work because everything is closed. I talk to them several times a week. I have been to there homes on the outskirts of Cabo and most of there homes are very small. They are telling me that they are on lock down except for shopping for food and if you are still lucky enough to be called into work every other week. They are hoping things open so they can get back to work but they know that it will be sometime before visitors start coming back. I am from NY where the virus hit us hard. Please respect the people, advisory and warnings of Cabo and stay away until it is safe to travel. They will always welcome us with open arms and the saying Welcome Home ! Another month to make sure would not hurt!"
Lol and there it is... my two posts get taken down for disagreeing with the “experts”.Yet the expert lady who books cruises get to stay? Weird. Like little teenagers throwing a fit because someone thinks differently than you.
"Welcome to TA where posts that ruffle feathers get deleted by “destination experts” who don’t even live here give advice that contradicts those of us who actually do, as in full time live here for years. Don’t expect any intelligent discourse to be tolerated.Proof of this will be my post here being deleted.Make no mistake, Cabo isn’t even beginning to posture for a “Re-opening”. If anyone thinks this place will be “good ol’ Cabo” this year, they are daft. We have much more Government control over our movement and daily life that those in the USA and look what a merde show that is.Edited: 10:11 am, May 15, 2020 "
So Painfully-on another thread a poster who says he’s down there states he ‘doesn’t see much difference’. Can you state whether he’s FOS? People look to these forums to plan vacations and so much information that contradicts is really confusing.
"I want to get back to the purpose of opening this thread. The governor of BCS has said that unless things change in the next two weeks, he will not remove the restrictions he has put in place. I posted this information so that people that are considering a trip very soon could consider this fact in their plans. That is all. Those that do not like what the local governor has done should take it up with him. I am removing all my posts that stray from this point."
If I could post a video I took last week I would. Not that it looks any different today. Let me see if my video host thing works and I’ll start a thread.
"Freddy4.....The Poster who stated he is in Cabo and Doesn't see much difference is Delusional, and has posted many misleading untrue comments. He is as you mentioned. El Jefe and Painfully Candids comments are the ones you can believe."
The border is still shut down so I am not sure how he made it down there!
"Michael F, the air border was not shut down."

">>The border is still shut down so I am not sure how he made it down there!<<There are flights between US cities and SJD each day. You can also cross on foot or by car. I have a friend (US citizen, non-Mexican) that crosses every weekend to go to his Rosarito house.Edited: 7:49 pm, May 15, 2020 "

We mysteriously went from “red” to “green” today. They said it was a “stop light” like scale. I guess since there’s no amber lights here I at least expected a flashing red first. But only on one of the three signal that work.
I am curious where Provo got his beer though. Private stock?
Since Prov1 flies on the family Lear Jet he most likely brought his own stash of beer.
Painfully-Is there a website that we can visit to track the stoplight scale?
">>We mysteriously went from “red” to “green” today. They said it was a “stop light” like scale. <<Really interesting. There is supposed to be an orange and yellow as well. I also just read that based on the health guidelines, the hotel association had decided not to re-open anything on 1 June. Who knows?Edited: 3:23 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"https://coronavirus.bcs.gob.mx/Edited: 4:48 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"Painfully_Candid, I'm pretty sure that is not the ""traffic light"" map. In this case, I think, the different shades of green are simply for different number of cases (1 - 50 & 51 - 100)."
"The traffic light map that I've seen is for all of Mx, not just Baja California. Each state, no matter the color, also has a symbol - an up arrow, square, or down arrow signifying if cases are increasing, stable, or decreasing. I looked all over the Ministry of Health website and the Office of Economic Affairs website, but couldn't find the map in question. The only place I've actually seen it was on the Cabo Mil News site."
"My question is if red means stop (alto) and stopping is only a suggestion in Cabo, where does this fall into the red, orange, yellow green stop light phasing? Ja ja. * This is a joke but yes, I do want to come to Cabo when I can!Edited: 5:57 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"P_C, I have to agree with Eljefe's analysis above....But I do prefer your take on the meaning of the map! :)"
go back to post 13
"Well, yesterday it was red. The color today is the opposite of red. Interpret what you like folks."
"nickfish, that is the map on which I based my initial post. Since P_C said it had turned green I was looking for an update. I couldn't find it. Hopefully Cabo Mil News will have an updated map or story tomorrow. I couldn't find one in either of the local on-line papers that I read."
"I saw a link to the traffic light map that is on BCS Governor Carlos Mendoza Davis's Facebook page. I am not a Facebooker, so maybe one of you can find that page??"
"Thanks K C. I find the picture of the map on his FB page but no link. I've found that a number of places, but not a link to where the info is generated. All the newspaper articles I have read say it is generated by the Mx Ministry of Health, but I have searched their website a number of times with no luck."
The governor of BCS said today that there is no new information that would allow him to announce any change to restrictions in place to control the spread of COVID-19. (Must have been a slow news day)
"Yes, That bad news for Los Cabos.  Looks like the June 1st Hotel openings are put off for an undetermined amount of time"
This report says it has changed to green.https://translate.google.com/translate…
"Well that is good news. I have been looking for updates in both Tribuna de Los Cabos and BCS Noticias, but missed this article. This appears to be the map that P_C posted, but it wasn't in the same format as the map from the Ministry of Health. This would be really good news. The next official update from the Ministry of Health is due soon. I hope it shows the same color!"
"Christi1072, I finally found the article you posted. It was way down the page in the local news rather than being on their COVID-19 page. There is also an article just above the one you linked to that says the traffic light color has not changed - it is still RED. That article says the green the map in your link is just reflecting the number of cases in the last 14 days. That was my interpretation of the map that P-C posted. Below is a link to the article that says the ""Traffic light"" condition is still red:https:/…Like I said, an update directly from the Minister of Health is due in a couple of days. That should clarify what is really going on - I hope!"
I think they are stalling so that there isn't a mad rush to Cabo come June 1. I spoke to JW Marriott and One and Only Palmilla and they plan on opening to guests June 1 once current restrictions are eased or lifted.
"I’m watching all the news as well eager to visit again. I realize nothing has changed as the minister has said. However the hotels are taking reservations, most starting Jun 1. Websites say they are opening June 1. I just can’t for the life of me believe that the owners of the hotels, like the Bulnes family and the Solmar properties don’t have a direct line of communication to the minister of tourism who would certainly gives them information about the situation that they don’t give the general public like you and I. I could very well be wrong but it’s hard to see these resorts pushing forward to open not knowing with certainty, from a source like the Minister, that opening was going to happen."
"Jjeter69, we're certainly going to find out pretty quickly. Less than two weeks remaining!"
"Agreed, we’ll be landing June 3rd, I’ll keep ya posted"
"Jjeter69, I just sent an e-mail to the Executive President of the Los Cabos Hotel Association to see if she can provide any official position on their planned re-opening. I have seen one news article saying that they have delayed their plans based on the high level of coronavirus alert, but haven't been able to corroborate it."
Much appreciate the Information @eljefe look forward to any of your updates.
"Jjeter69, just out of curiosity, have you checked with the place that you are staying to be sure that your reservations still good? I suspect the answer is yes, but this just doesn't seem right. Several news reports from local papers say that they are now expecting mid-June (rather than mid-May as earlier) to be the time of the maximum spread of COVID-19 in Los Cabos. That in itself would indicate, at least to me, that early June would be a really bad time to remove the restrictions that are in place."
"I did today, said that they were opening June 1, I also called another place we stay every month and they said they were opening as well, but obviously I’ll be playing It day to day until that time arrives."
