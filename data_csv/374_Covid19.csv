Does anybody have any information regarding the situation at the Puerto plata airport due to covid-19
"Dominican government announced no flight in or out from Europe, China, Korea etc starting March 16th 6 am for one month."
I follow the Sunscape travellers Facebook page and someone that arrived yesterday said there were no issues business as usual. We are rescheduling our March 19 trip :(
"Okay thank you, nothing about Canada"
"Okay, thank you"
"Landed at Pearson at 8:30pm yesterday from Puerto Plata.I have never seen Puerto Plata airport so busy.Activities at all inclusive hotels have been halted.Locals are concerned that there may be many undocumented cases in their cities. Most health insurance companies no longer include treatment for the virus outside of Canada DONT GO !!!!!!!Edited: 2:20 pm, March 16, 2020 "
I guess you won't have a choice any longer. Canada closed borders. Good luck and stay safe.
Closed borders to non Canadians and non residents except Americans. And only 4 major airports taking flights
"This measure will not impact American flights, or those from the Caribbean or Mexico. But there is still avoid non essential travel, out of Canada.Edited: 3:03 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Sunwing has just cancelled ALL South travel until April 9. What does this mean for travellers already there? No flights leaving Canada. Surely they have to bring them home don’t they?
"Sunwing will fly aircraft down empty as repatriation flights just like TUI UK did today to get passengers back to the UK. from Punta Cana.Angie.Edited: 4:38 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Luvthesun,Here is the link to Sunwing's announcement.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/16/20…Angie."
Our neighbours opted to leave two months early and were extremely lucky to get a flight back to Canada on Air Canada at inflated prices. Since Canada put out the order for no nonessential travel ..insurance companies are only honouring their contracts 10 days past the announcement.We know a couple stuck in Costa Rico who are stuck with no flights in or out. If the bug is in Dominican Republic there is no stopping it due to no health care to speak of. DONT TRAVEL!!
DR closing its borders.. air land and sea.... wishing them all good health
"Yes DR is closing their borders air, land, sea at 6:00 AM Thursday March 19th. President Danilo Medina announced. Only repatriation flights allowed to get foreign citizens returned to their country of origin.https:/…Angie."
"And those ""ferry"" flights (getting you home) will only continue for the next couple of days. Get out and get out now do not delay unless you want to spend the next few months here in the DR where things are going to go down hill very rapidly.BObK"
