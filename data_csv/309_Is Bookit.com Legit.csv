"Hi,My fiancé and I are wanting to book a honeymoon and have found Bookit.com has great deals. Is this site legit.Thanks and your responses are greatly appreciated."
"You can search on TripAdvisor and read other members experiences of using them. Scroll up and type Bookit.com into the search box just above your question, then from the drop-down menu choose ""All Forums"" to search. Topics mentioning them will be displayed for you to read."
"As noted, they are legit. I see a lot of posts about bookings for places like Cancun, for example. I believe they've been in business some time. In addition to doing a search on TripAdvisor, also do a google search <bookit.com reviews> and read some of those. Also review their Terms & Conditions here:http://bookit.com/terms-of-use/"
Thank u!! I've done more research and agree they are.
"We booked an all-inclusive resort and flight with Bookit. When we got to the airport, our flight was overbooked, and none of our group (6 on the flight) were able to sit together. Ok, not a huge deal. But then when we got to the hotel, our rooms were overbooked too. There were 13 people in our group and NONE of us got the room we paid for! And we had all used Bookit 6 months prior to our trip to reserve our rooms. ?!?? After confronting the hotel, I was given a ""certificate"" to send to Bookit for a refund of the amount/difference we paid for the original room, and it so far has been 6 weeks of multiple phone calls and emails with representatives and the manager, and they only refunded me 1/3 of the difference. It has been a nightmare speaking with the customer service representatives that give you nothing but attitude when you have a legitimate claim... We take a group vacation every year and have used travel agents and multiple websites. But we will NEVER book a vacation with Bookit again, and we are making sure every website knows this. AWFUL!!!"
"There's no better way to be at the top of the list to be bumped when they overbook than to book through a third party site. Plus, they nor any other agent has any inside track to lower rates than you can get direct with the hotel. If there's a difference, you've missed the difference in conditions of the booking. This and other third party travel sites are ""legit."" They're lawful businesses. They do for you what they say they will do for you, which you discover isn't much, if you actually read their Terms & Conditions that you say you have read when you check a box, usually just before you pay. My principle is: You have no business using a third party site unless you're fully capable of booking yourself, and if you're capable of booking yourself, why would you insert an unknown into the deal? Learn how to find the best deals direct from the providers. I guarantee you can equal the third party deals and, from time to time, do dramatically better with deals they will never offer you because they can't react quickly enough to take advantage of them. And even if you don't find an absolute lower price, there's more to relaxed travel than a few dollars."
"It has been said that booking via what is, effectively, a fourth or fifth party that sources rooms through bedbanks and wholesalers, is a good way to put yourself at the very top of the list for being bumped. Too be near the bottom, book direct, and then the next best thing is to book via a site that does have a direct link to the hotel."
"If I can give no stars I would. I am actually on the phone with Bookit.com now. This has been an ongoing process for almost a month now. I have called numerous times which resulted in no progress. I had booked a reservation for my parent's anniversay to cancun, but due to Hurrican Harvey, they were unable to attend. I was able to receive a full refund from the airline, but trying to modify my hotel has been hell. I am only trying to switch my dates, not cancel, all that takes is an e-mail to the hotel and checking their availability. Something that should have taken a couple days, has been taking weeks and still unresolved. I have been placed on hold at times for up an hour and 25 minutes seeking someone who could help. This case should have been handled by one person and not me having to call each day asking for updates. I was finally able to find someone that changed it for me and when I was suppose to get a confirmation e-mail I never got it. Just for me to call back the next day and have someone tell me that they never resolved the issue. It took me having to repeat "" I am going to take legal actions"" for someone to transfer me to a manager. And by the way if you call trying to make a new reservation the wait is only 2 minutes compared to if you are calling for an already existing reservation. That just shows you what they care about most. I have never had a problem with their services until now. I will NEVER use this website again. Not even if they finally fix their lack of customer services and performance. No one there knows what they are doing and it's frustrating to be in this predicament. It took me til my 4th time using them to know that they do not value their customers. If you want to try them, be my guest, but the day that something goes wrong, know it is going to be a process of wait time, frustration, and calling."
Finally got through to them on the phone after many attempts plus emailing three times. Talk about impatient and unpleasant. I found myself apologizing every time I responded to comments like “ma’am I just told u!” “Did u not check ur account before y called” “don’t u even know u have insurance on your account”. And still didn’t get my question answered. I guess I should have don better research. I’m sorry 4 what u went thru and pray it doesn’t happen to us
"So they seem legit. But there pricing is no bargain.The flights im seeing all have 10-15 hour layovers in Houston! So total travel times of 20 hours +. Or, you can pay another $500 for less travel time.My advice: book it all directly yourself. Maybe this company is for rich lazy people."
How do you learn to find the best deals from the providers?Thank You
"BonApetitDetroit,Which providers do you mean? Are you talking about BookIt.com which is the company being discussed in this forum topic, or do you mean various websites in general which allow you to book hotel rooms, eg. Third-party booking sites like Hotels.com, booking.com. Expedia etc?"
"I don't think I can argue with anything you've said 5thEn. All I can really add is to say that my personal idea of a good deal is something that I think provides very good value and includes everything I want to be included.So, I don't search for the cheapest deals at all. A good example of why would be a flight with a low cost airline. Not only might a flight with a flag bearer work out cheaper on the end, but booking via a third party might add further fees, especially if I want to change anything, meaning that I end up paying a lot more than by booking direct."
"DO NOT BOOK WITH Bookit.com!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They will lie about services and prices to get your booking. They will tell you it is on your confirmation, when you call to say it isn't they will say they never said it. They will say management will follow up in three to five business days and they will not. Book with a reputable company, I hate myself for being so stupid. They have the best prices because they are lying. Call center in Jamaica, no accountability."
Do not use this site.... fraudulent advertising and robotic employees... I made a very big mistake by using them to celebrate my 60 bday. Beware
"I booked a 6-night stay at a resort in Orlando, FL. I did not purchase the cancellation price. Unfortunately, my daughter was hospitalized and had to undergo testing for cancer. Worst time of our lives. Our airline and car rental refunded our cancellation fees after I provided proof of her hospitalization. Not Book It. They will hold you to the contract. You will never deal with PEOPLE on a third party booking. Only CONTRACTS. Just know this going in."
"Yes, you must read the contract you'll be entering into and understand the potential consequences. While some companies will offer gestures of good will and not enforce the terms, some won't and will enforce a contract to the letter, as is their right. Remember that being allowed out of the contract is not something that anyone should expect to happen as a matter of course."
They are legit but do not think booking with them is the best idea.
"I got bad experience with bookit and would not recommend any one to use this side to book your vacation. When I book my vacation they did not give me ability to pay for transportation from Punta Cana airport Dominican Republic to Paradisus resort. In airport their representatives tell us that we have to pay $8 per person and we where very happy, we paid $16 to resort, also they told us that we can buy transportation back from resort from Bookit representative. Next day we meet representative from Bookit and he told us that we have to pay for transportation $68... or take the taxi for $40 (actual price $35). Another: for room updates we have to pay additional $800; fly was changed and we did not get the sit that we are booked. They even do not let the customers publish any reviews about their trips. Do not book with Bookit if you want to get good vacation."
DO NOT use this site!
"I will never use bookit again. I booked with them last night and found a better price. They would not honor their price guarantee when I found a better price at the hotel's Web site. When I tried to cancel, they said the hotel is non-refundable. So a $5k trip is non-refundable. And it says this in the very, tiny, small print. This should be prominent and in bold so that others do not get misled this way. Talking to their customer service was painful. They would not do anything to remedy the situation. Basically, it's your fault and we are keeping your money. I literally contacted them an hour after booking. I've learned a valuable lesson. Please learn from my mistake and do not use this company.Edited: 2 years ago "
Good dayI have had a different experience with them. I had booked with Bookit.com to go Bahamas and I made my own flight arrangements. Unfortunately I couldn't get a flight for the days I booked the hotel and had to travel a day later. Book it after I admit some time trying to get through did reimburse me fully for the one night and in fact I was given a rebate on the three other nights resulting in some really good savings and refund. Yes they take long to answer the phones but I am pleased with their service. Will I use them again. Yes. They delivered for me. R Garcia. Trinidad and Tobago
"I have used them for a few years and had I seen your question before my recent holiday I would've said.... they're 100% legit. HOWEVER, like many, I've now gotten stung. Selected resort to Royal Decameron montego Bay Jamaica as usual online then completed booking via telephone with an agent. Not only was the resort a nightmare (horrible, unclean and disappointing; but so was Book It.com agent when I called to discuss my disappointment the morning after arrival. The BookIt.com agent advised that my rwference ID showed that I booked via ""expedia"" despite never using ""Expedia a day in my life. I was told to call them for assistance. Once back home Book It.com confirmed that I indeed booked with Book It.com and.......surprise, surprise, that telephone conversation was not detected or could be found on the system. The agent Kati Pantoja in the complaints department was so useless, it was painful to converse with her.I can now safely say that I will never ever recommend or use Book it.com again."
I am sorry your vacation went so badly with bookit. Thank you for your full review. I am having 2nd doubts with using them. This is the 4th bad review about them I've gotten. Want to know that with money being paid that I got actually what I paid for.
"Do not use this site I book with them for the first time, and I will NEVER use this website again. They charge more than other sites and when you call to tell them about their price match guarantee they give you tons of excuses to not honor their word. Their customer services is horrible is the worst I have ever seen and don’t let me get started on their performance. They don’t know what they are doing and it's infuriating to be in this dilemma. Too late I found out that they do not value their customers, because if you call to make a new reservation the wait is only 2 or 4 minutes compared to when you are calling for an existing reservation. Do NOT use them, however, if you want to find out be my guest, but something will go wrong, and you will waste your time, which will lead to frustration and anger."
We used Bookit.com for our all inclusive to Punta Cana and was very satisfied. They met us at the airport and had no problems at all. Would use them again!
"This is the worst place to book ur holiday! Give them a kiss, total rip off charging my card twice for $6500 each time!"
We had such a terrible experience with bookit.com that we had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with them. So I’m not allowed to discuss details about our horrible trip with them but I can share that it left a little girl dressed up like a princess crying in front of the Magic Kingdom because we didn’t have a way in. And that’s just a tiny part of our problems with them.
"There's no way I would sign a non disclouse agreement in anyone. In my view, that's only a small step above blackmail, if they made it a condition of giving you a refund of some kind."
"Bookit.com is definitely, 100% NOT LEGIT.Do not do business with this company.Incredibly shady practices.Stay Away!!"
"Do NOT use Bookit. Omg. We went to Dominican earlier this month and although the room was hotel was great, the shuttle service we prepaid for from airport to hotel was ridiculous!! They kept lying and saying they had more people to pick up. We waited 45 minutes no one else showed up! There wasn’t even anymore room on the shuttle. Everyone got upset and got off and took a private taxi. The taxi driver and the original shuttle driver split the money for the taxi right in front of us. We were shocked! Now trying to get a refund from Bookit for the shuttle service. It’s been 2 weeks of back and forth and they refuse to refund the shuttle service going from hotel to airport Bc we refused to take it. Ummm ya how could i trust them to show up???"
"I'm a little confused, sorry, Violetta. You say that no one turned up, then you say that there was no room on the vehicle, followed by noting that everyone got off because they were upset. Presumably once everyone had got off, there would have been plenty of room for those that couldn't get on? (if you see what I mean)And for all this to happen, somehting must have turned up, right?"
We just returned from a great vacation through Bookit. Two couples booked flights and rooms to Cancun and we had no problems. Everything was exactly as advertised. I would use them again without hesitation.
"Hello,I noticed your post regarding the website bookit.com...did you book with them? And if so, are they legit? Thanks so much!"
"I will never use them again. I put up an honest assessment of my stay at a resort. They edited my review where I talked about how it was a nightmare to deal with Bookit.They may be legit, but they sure are not ethical!"
"Agree. I have used them four times and every single time, they have screwed me over. (You would think I would have learned after the first time). They have hung up on me numerous times. Lied about talking with the resort when the manager was sitting right in front of me. They edited my review on their site! Said it’s in their terms, so how can anyone trust reviews on their site if they are editing them? “BookIt.com® reserves the right to reject, censor, or edit Guest reviews where necessary..” Where necessary means if it tells the truth about their unethical business practices."

"I used to love Bookit. It was dependable, easy and quick. But with time its competitors have stepped up their game and they've fallen behind. Today was my third and last time I tried to book with them in the last year. Each time I book, the system has an error where some portion of the package changes in price. The other portion is still charged to your card. So you end up having to call and cancel, waiting on the phone, and then waiting for 10 days for them to return your money. Sounds like a nice way for them to have easy money to work with while you left trying to figure out other vacation plans. Terrible. Never again. Go elsewhere and save yourself the time and frustration."
"Bait ans Switch! They listed one price on their website, but it would not let me book 5 rooms at once. I called bookit and they said that price was no longer available, but they could get me the same deal for $10 per night per room more. I agreed but then they said the system would not allow booking 5 rooms at one time, and they would have to book each room separately. After they booked 2 of the rooms, I realized that the price they were charging me was not the same price they had quoted, and the new booking could not be cancelled. I immediately stopped the transaction and told the agent to cancel the two rooms already booked. He said they couldn't be cancelled, but I could call a different number to cancel. The second number I called never followed through, even though they promised that they had contacted the hotel. Now the hotel is forcing my credit card company to stand good on the charge, since they claim they were never informed about the cancellation."
Wow. Thank you for sharing your experience.
Used book it 14 times. We are currently in cancun at occidental. Book it has met and exceeded our needs every single time. Will keep using them great company
Absolutely terrible customer service and unethical business practices. Booked our all inclusive trip and American Airlines could not honor our itinerary provided by bookit. Bookit would not help in any way and left us stranded. Bookit customer service hung up on me. Having to come out of pocket just to get home. Bookit is a horrible company and ruined my honeymoon. Won't return my emails or let me speak to a supervisor. I am writing this from a hotel when I should be home
They left me stranded. American airlines did not honor their itinerary.
Look up their google reviews. Evil company.
Update:We did use them and honeymoon was great! It was just st the two of us not sure I would use with others tho
Oh wow sorry to hear this! From the thread more ppl have had bad experiences then the good. Glad ours worked out but I’m very cautious about them
"No it’s not. My mother and I just went to Ocean Coral & Torquesa in Cancun for my 18th birthday and they had us fill out this survery at one of the restaurants on my birthday night (WHICH THEY FORGOT ABOUT) So we did and when came back to the states, my mother did some research on the resort itself and found out that somebody had posted a review about their own hotel stating how awesome they were when in reality they were horrible. Please beware and stick to TripAdvisor or just beware in general when visiting Cancun."
"The following is what has happened to me and is strictly my opinion.Do not use Bookit.com. I booked a hotel for $80 per person per night and added in transfers from the airport to the hotel. Then added a coupon. I then paid with a credit card. When the confirmation was sent to me the price for the hotel was $95 per person and the airport transfers were not on the confirmation.I called customer service and spoke with Anna and she was of no help and very rude. I had to ask for a supervisor 3 times as she kept on cutting me off when I began to speak. Finally a Sandra Lawrence - supervisor - came on the phone and it only got worse. When I would answer her questions or tried to explain she would cut me off.Her response was that since the Bookit.com website is a live website the price can change while you are booking. The price displayed may not be what you pay. Hmmm......can we say bait and switch? Sure we can. Then she stated that when a coupon is added it does remove anything else you added to your cart except for the hotel. per her comments, It is up to the me to know how the system operates as that is just how it is. After a lengthy conversation, she offered to book the airport transfer and then she would give me a 50% credit for future travel. I refused. After stating I would be filing fraud charges she then said she could charge my credit card for the transfer and then would refund that money. Again I refused based on other reviews stating they never got their refunds. I asked to have someone from the corporate office contact me and she refused. She stated that I needed to call back in and ask for the corporate office. I asked to have her supervisor call me and gave them 48 hours to do as such but no phone call at all which seems to be how Bookit.com operates. Well I tried all day yesterday to get a hold of someone at their corporate office and never could get through to anyone. I even left a voice mail and no one can be bothered.Please do yourself a favor and do not book with this company. Their prices may appear to be great but you most certainly do not get what you paid for. If you like a company that does a bait and switch on the consumer then this company will satisfy your needs."
"I was questioning the legitimacy of Bookit too. I saw lots of mixed reviews and decided to just go for it. I just came back from a five day trip in Punta Cana and it was amazing! The only thing that was concerning, was that their customer support was very hard to reach. I tried calling, email and Facebook messenger and got no reply. But once I finally got in touch with someone, they were very friendly. I would definitely book again with them."
"I just arrived in Puerto Vallarta. When I have called them, to complain, they blocked my number!!!Never!!! Never!!! Use this website!!!They were very rude !!!I have wasted my money and vacation!!!Sucks!!!"
"HORIBLE,DON'T FALL FOR IT , SCAMMERS!I purchased a trip from Bookit.com for a trip to "" The Royal Playa del Carmen"" I had a seizure after purchasing this trip. I had a seizure in flight on a airplane. I purchase travel insurance through Bookit.com (AIG Travel Guard), I have sense been fighting for over 2 months trying to get this handled. I have filled out all forms they have supplied and as well as have medical proof of my seizure , and they still refuse to approve my claim.At this point I consider at $3,000 I had spent a complete loss and was one of the largest learning experiences ive ever gone through.Long story short, us a different online Booking service , this company is here to make a profit even at the expense of their customer. Worst travel experience ive ever had , and I didn't even get to go on the trip.Sincerely Trevor Manton"
"Trevor, while it is always wise to purchase travel insurance and far too many people choose not to, never buy it from a company from which you are also purchasing flights/accommodations/etc. You need to be independently insured and have a company that’s only looking out for you. (I use World Nomads and love it.) I’m sorry this happened to you, and like you said, it’s an expensive lesson learned."
"***CANADIANS BEWARE***Despite going through Expedia.ca, I got rooted to bookit.com for my reservation.. Everything was great until I got my credit card bill with an extra $500.00.. All pricing is in USD, even though my receipt says 1274.00 with no reference to the USD. The actual charge was 1744.00. The best the could do was send me a new receipt with USD added. I did the no refund option as I am traveling on business, my bad... it would have been cheaper for me to book direct.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I am surprised to see all of the negative reviews about Bookit here! We have booked all-inclusive family vacations four times through Bookit and getting ready to book our fifth. Each time, they provided the best price (by far!) were very easy to use and we had no issues at all! I first research hotels on oyster.com to find the resort we want to stay at and then stalk the bookit site for weeks until that specific resort has an excellent sale and then I book. If you plan ahead and give yourself at least a month or two out, this is actually easy and you can always find a good sale as they often have weekly and flash sales which can take thousands of $$ off your resort.Of course, bookit or any other third party have no control over airline and hotel decisions and usually, those problems are because of how the airline/hotel do business. I have had problems booking air/hotels direct and those problems stem from the actual airlines/hotels overbooking themselves! Because of this, I will not book air through a third party, I always book air direct and then book the resort through Bookit.I have even canceled a hotel booking when our plans changed and had no problem with that, either. I am wondering if people having problems are not reading the fine print? Third party sellers cannot be responsible for airlines or hotels overbooking. That is the fault of the airline/hotel. Research the hotel you're considering on TripAdvisor to see how check-in is handled and stay away from hotels with negative reviews! Also, if you need to cancel a stay through bookit, there are specific dates you need to cancel your reservation by for a full refund, but that is a standard practice for any hotel stay."
"Well, I suggest you read what people are saying. The majority of people are saying poor customer service, no phone calls back, bait and switch and of course the issues are never Bookit.com's fault. In my case it was Bookit.com's fault due to a bait and switch issue. When I requested a supervisor of the supervisor to call me back I never did receive a phone call. I have called several times with no response from management. Management hopes that the customer will just give up. Even look at other complaint sites where someone from Bookit.com responded. Sometimes it is the person's own fault or something that Bookit.com has no control over but there are more complaints where Bookit.com DID have control over.Please go to the BBB in Florida as they have an F rating. https:/…bookitcom-inc-0683-1003670That says it all!I cannot recommend them at all."
Don’t do it they totally ripped me off.
I got ripped off for $800 I would not use this company.
Agree terrible!!
great question
"Bookit is a scam. They deliberately send wrong bank information through to your account. My bank said they sent the wrong expiration date on my card and a red flag came up, they tried to send the transaction through 13 times causing the bank to cancel payment. Then they say that they canceled the trip but sent you a bill for 2,000 dollars saying that they can't cancel the airfare and you are responsible for it. We discovered this tonight by calling them. Please don't book with them."
"Bookit.com is a legitimate company but it is not a good company. I paid for 3 nights at a hotel. After the first night I had to return home. When I talked to the people at the hotel they said there was a penalty of one night which meant that I would at least be refunded for one night. Now that I am home when I speak to the hotel they say I have to talk to Bookit and Bookit says I have to take it up with the hotel. So really they are not a good company and maybe I could have let the one night go but what really really bothers me is that they sent me an email with someone else's travel plans. I know their name, their flights, I have their hotel voucher, I mean I have everything I need to take over their holiday, I would not do that but I certainly could. So this of course begs the question, ""what part of my information was sent to other people?"" When I tried to talk to the company about this breach of privacy they seem to be trying to deny it. They sent me an email saying ""oops we sent you an email with the wrong subject line"", not the wrong subject line the wrong content. I still have the email so I can prove what I am saying. So bottom line be careful what information you give them because they may release it to the wrong person!!"
"Terrible experience! I booked an all inclusive hotel with Bookit to St Maarten. 3 days before the flight, I receive an email from bookit.com telling me that the hotel is not going to re-open on time. meanwhile, I have already bought my airplane tickets. I was offered a free ""cancellation"" (funny enough, given that they cancelled on me), or travel at later date (which is not an option as the kids would be in school), or another hotel (not all inclusive, much lower standards). they also offered me to travel to Mexico instead, but no refund or compensation whatsoever for cancelling the airline tickets to St Maarten (needless to say, booking a flight to Mexico 3 days before the flight is way more expensive)"
"Well, I booked an all inclusive in Puerto Morelos with them. I've been trying to inform their airport transfer people about my flight change info and I CAN NOT get through to them by phone. I WILL NEVER book through them again!!!"
"IF IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS!! I WILL NEVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH BOOKIT.COM! I had to cancel our reservations to Aruba due to my father in law diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Doctors said he can die anytime in the next couple week up to a year... we dont know until God takes him. For this reason we had to cancel... The total amount of my booking was $1685.... I am only being reimbursed $517....Their cancellation fees ARE TOTAL RIP OFF TO THE CUSTOMER!!....RIDICULOUS!!... The airfare was tripled compared to what Jet Blue website says the airfare cost... $235 for the both of us, meanwhile BookIt charged us $281 ea!!!... and of course now I have to deal w/ the change fees from the airline which is additional loss!!! Basically I lost all my money!!Stay away from this horrible travel agency!!! It is a total customer SCAM !!!Edited: 1 year ago "

"Lovehawaii4ever,“The airfare was tripled compared to what Jet Blue website says the airfare cost... $235 for the both of us, meanwhile BookIt charged us $281 each”. Did you only start checking the airlines own website after you had made a booking with BookIt? Usually it’s best to check the airline first and then book directly on the airlines own website.That’s awful that your family member is very sick. Cancelling a trip usually involves costs and fees. Were they outlined and described in Bookit’s Terms and Conditions pages? Did you have Travel Insurance Policy for this trip? Possibly you could have made a claim to recover some of the costs involved in cancelling depending of course on the inclusions and exclusions of the Policy, cancellations due to close family major illness etc can be covered. It’s risky to choose to book Non-refundable components of a trip as you are hoping that nothing will go wrong, prevent you from travelling, nobody will get sick, or there won’t be a major weather event delaying you or impacting your trip. Travel Insurance can protect you.So it sounds like you took a risk and chose to book non-refundable, didn’t check prices on the airlines website, possibly didn’t know that booking companies are in business to make money so have fees if you choose to cancel or change your plans, on top of any fees the airlines charge.So, no scam here. Just lack of research and probable lack of Travel Insurance."
"If you read their webpage T&C, it does not specify what fees they charge for cancellations, changes, etc.. it just says ""fees may apply""... I understand there were going to be fees incurred by us having to cancel, but over $1,000 is a bit disgusting... No, I did not choose to use their travel insurance because it was not very clear on what it would cover... alot of grey areas... so yes, I did my research... and their website is full of grey areas... DO NOT USE BOOKIT.COM!!... and BTW, expect to stay on hold for hours!!! HORRIBLE TRAVEL AGENCY!"
"I didn’t say to “use their Travel Insurance”. It’s never a good idea to choose the travel Insurance a booking company offers. It’s usually best to independently research and compare Travel Insurance policies from insurance companies and select one which fits your needs. This topic link below is one I started for the forum about choosing and comparing Travel Insurance policies, and many forum contributors added their replies, recommendations and information. Maybe read through it all:- https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-…“I did my research” - If you did your research before booking the trip why didn’t you choose to book the cheaper airfares the airline website was displaying?If BookIt was “full of grey areas” and their fees unclear then why would you proceed with the booking through them? While researching and reading their website if it was unclear, and fees were not specified then that would be a red flag and I would not go further."
"thanks for the link... and you are absolutely correct... i should have not booked with Bookit.com... i truly never thought i would have had to cancel our trip... my father in law was an extremely healthy man, up to two weeks ago... and his condition is deteriorating rapidly unfortunately due to an agressive brain tumor... ='(... and as i previously mentioned, I knew there were fees, but never to this extreme... my entire trip, airfare and hotel totalled $1685... Bookit.com is ONLY reimbursing $517.60... you have to admit, this is extremely excessive penalty feesAppreciate your feedback, and believe me, I have learned my lesson... going forward, I will be planning my vacations as i've done in the past, contacting airlines and hotels directly... will never use an online travel agency again... I CONSIDER MYSELF FOOLED by cheap pricing... =("
"Yes bookits fees for cancelling sounds huge. That would have been a shock to find out just how much. I always book flights direct with an airline. I don’t often choose to book hotels directly. Sometimes I do, but other times I book on a few well-known and big hotel booking sites I know and trust. Of course there are T and C on all sites, even when booking direct. I hope you stick around on this Bargain Travel forum to read some of the other resources here and also explore some of the other Tripadvisor forums. For example, Top Questions on a forum are good to read. Our Bargain Travel forum TQ are links to Know-how topics, hints and tips to book safely, articles about how various booking sites operate, etc. Top Questions can be found at the top right-hand side of a forums page (visible if you are on the full website, not the limited Tripadvisor APP).Every city, region, island and country in the world also has its own Travel forum and we members/travellers all ask and answer questions on Holiday destinations so if you are planning a trip you can get advice on hotels, transport, local dining, sightseeing etc. That can be great when planning your own trips. Plus there are other forums on travel topics and themes. Here’s a link to the forums homepage:- https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ForumHomeDreadful news about your father-in-law and it’s obviously a stressful and concerning time for you all."
You’re able to book multiple vacations with bookit? Your name isn’t flagged when rebooking? Just booked the Cabo flash sale tonight & the questions she asked made me think you could only book with them once.
"thank you for all your support and the links!Best,"
We just used them for a trip to Cancun. NEVER again!!! Our flight was canceled and we had to call and negotiate another flight. BookIt customer service said the were closed due to heavy volume. They never returned voice messages or emails. We had to ask around for ground transportation because they never told us who to look for. I paid extra for private transportation but got zero customer service from BookIt!!!
"sorry and feel for you... worst online travel agency!! Everyone should beware... cheap vacations... you get what you pay for... unfortunately... LISTEN EVERYONE, STAY AWAY FROM BOOKIT.COM!!"

"We just returned from a trip at Excellence Playa Mujeres using bookit. I looked for lower rates and even called the resort to see if they would match it and was able to secure the best rate through them. To me it was worth saving over $300. I mean why would I want to pay more? We did not book airfare through them, only the resort. They offer a payment program as well to break up the total due. I had a great experience with them and found them to be very helpful and pleasant when I called them directly."
"Traveling Texan,So you joined TA not to tell us what a wonderful vacation you had in Mexico, but what a wonderful travel agency you used? Interesting."
"I responded to the question if bookit was legit. So yes, I believe that’s an applicable response. I read through many posts on TA that helped guide me in the decision making process for our vacation and thought it could be helpful to someone else. Hoping others will see anything I post in the future as helpful and honest."
The issue is that a first time poster who has just joined TA and then praises a company that has been criticised by others looks suspicious. I'm sure you can see why.
I guess my first post should have been critical. The common thread I’ve noticed pertaining to all negative comments with third party bookings is issues when they need to make changes or request a refund. We didn’t and had no problems. I apologize for being a first timer here but we all have to start somewhere.
"Indeed we do, and I was not criticising your or your post. I was only attempting to explain why first time posters who praise a much criticised company sometimes get the response you had.You are entitled to post negative or positive comments here, but the point is, that so is every other user. All we have to do is to stay within the forum posting rules, which are pretty relaxed these days.I hope you will stick around and contribute to other discussions. There is much to be learnt on the TA forums (this is a relatively quiet one) and I'm sure that there is a lot you can share about your travels, too."
"I've purchased hotels and packages through them a few times, most recently last Dec to Playa Mujeres. While the process was simple each time, and I had no issues with the actual bookings, what I've realized is that Bookit puts you into the WORST rooms at the hotels. Despite entering my Elite status with 2 chains during the booking process (under the rewards tab), at Checkin, we were surprised by the rooms that faced the parking lot, or construction. The kicker is I had booked Ocean Front at all. Bookit customer service was zero help, claiming it's based on availability at checkin. Sure. So imagine my disappointment at having to upgrade my rooms at additional expense, simply to have the room I booked and paid for.3x, won't be a 4th"
"Have called many times to change , waited over 4 hours with no response was told would have answer in 24 hours today was told 7-10 days unacceptable they are now holding over 8k of my money and no answer we book many trips and I can say this is the last time I will use them buyer be ware"
"Bookit.com is legit, but be VERY cautious as they are of little to no help if you run into issues with your booking.1) Transfers to / from the airport. In our case they outsourced to a local travel agent BD Travel who took both the pick up and return trip vouchers from us promising to have an agent at the hotel the next day. S/he was a no show and calling back Bookit we're told we have to deal with BD. Unfortunately BD's phones are disconnected. Took three more calls to Bookit to get a confirmation that our return transfer was in place.2) Part of the package included a few hundred dollars in vouchers which we never received. Called bookit from the hotel and were told we had to deal with the hotel for the vouchers. Hotel indicated we had to sit through a 90 minute presentation to get them but there was no mention of that in the terms and conditions. Several calls to Bookit later we finally got the vouchers the night before we checked out. 3) While those issues were terribly annoying and a waste of our time, the vacation otherwise was good, but a month or so after our return we find that Bookit.com charged us for an extra night even though we had paid for the nights in advance and did not stay an extra night. Tried to deal with credit card company but bookit just sent them our itinerary and since they could not make heads or tails of it, they cannot help us. SO now I have to deal with Bookit again but they are never open!! The phone numbers on their site are useless.BE VERY CAREFUL."

What do you mean by “official”? Have you read through the 87 replies in this forum topic to see what people have said about them? There are probably other forum topics on them too if you do a search of all forums.
Yes it is. 14 of us just booked with bookit to Aruba last week. The place was great (Divi Golf) only bad thing was pool bar and pool slide closing at 6. But if you're on you're honeymoon you wont care

I would say this is more the hotel than bookit. Bookit only sells what the hotel tells them they can sell
Id say this is more the hotel than bookit. Bookit only sells what the hotel gives them to sell.
"Please do not book with the company, they change the days of your card payment without consulting you. and the price is very expensive."

"Book it messed up my Round trip ground transportation, although it was their mistake they wanted to refund me the money I paid Which was 60 dollars to only have to book with the company Directly for 91 dollars all though it was their fault. Also Best Day transport company charges more than a regular Taxi to our resort and you have to make multiple stops with them. On top of that we had to reschedule our trip to the same resort but different days. We went to reschedule our tickets with I guess their preferred airlines for Cancun which is jet blue and they advised after the fact jet blue charges 200.00 per person plus what the addition cost was and their rebooking fee. They said it would be over a 1000.00 to rebook on top of what we already paid which was over 700.00. We ended up just having to buy totally new tickets through spirits for right at 900.00 dollars it was a nightmare I’ll never use them again and probably the jet blue tickets will go unused so to their ridiculous rebooking fee"
"Thankyou! Just the type of information I was looking for, I definitely will NOT be booking w/ them"
"Yes is legit website, booked my vacation and everything was corectly."
"Not pleased with Bookit. The photo of the view was deceptive. It said ""ocean view"" and the only ocean view was from a tiny corner. It said balcony but unlike almost every other room, the balcony was for standing only--other balconies had table and chairs. Unless I was on the balcony, the view was other rooms and not even a partial ocean view. Make sure that the picture is correct.Edited: 3:30 am, December 12, 2019 "
"Alex,You actually think any online travel agency inspects every room in every hotel they offer? Did you raise your complaint to the hotel? What did they say, probably blamed it on bookit. I am not endorsing bookit by any means, just addressing your unrealistic expectations for what an OTA is."
"It is not unrealistic. I've never had this issue with other companies. It is deceptive. If you show a picture you should provide that room. If you describe a room, the room should be as described. Because you are willing to accept substandard experiences doesn't mean I should."
So what did the hotel say when you complained about the room?
"If you are looking for good service and bargain run away, they mislead with inaccurate information and there is no customer service if you are traveling overseas. No phone support. So you may be stuck with bad booking and no recourse.RUN AWAY FROM THIS SITE AND THEIR SERVICE"
"Hello I reallyfeelyour pain with this company . It’s been bout 5 months now and we still can’t Contact after numerous of call and promise . Please tell who helped you and so you still have the number if so can you please post it . My bday vacation was horrible and what’s worse is we can’t contact . Next step is BBB and an attorney . We paid too much for this vacationEdited: 9:49 am, January 15, 2020 "
Does anyone have any contact information for this company on bad service they directed to marketing and sales . It’s 5 months and still in the same place. This company is the worst ever . RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY
"Worst customer service of any company I have ever done business with. Booked an airfare resort package in December. Received an email stating the booked flight was changed and the alternatives offered were not acceptable to me. I called and was told I could get a refund and book my flight elsewhere. Called back on February 2nd and I was told Air Mexico does not give refunds and that I would have to accept the change. I spent well over 8 hrs on the phone with the flight department. Between February 2nd and 9th. Each day I spoke with a supervisor that advised me they would look into it and call me back. I never received a return call. I called Air Mexico on February 9th, they were very helpful and informed me I could get a refund since they cancelled the flight however bookit would have to request it since they booked on my behalf. He also stated as of today they have not requested a refund. Again I called bookit on the phone for over 2 hrs and still no answers."
I wouldn’t I would just try the resort itself . The service is horrible
Horrible service
"Lisa, perhaps it may assist others and yourself if you can describe what happened It doesn't look you're going to get very far with this company, but depending on what the issues were maybe you can get some help from your card provider."
We had to cancel our trip to Mexico for medical reasons . We purchased travel insurance . Book it .com gave us the run around said no refunds we paid in money monthly they said we had to pay another 895.00 on airlines totally misleading . I understood there fees like 195.00 will be lost . I’m ok with that . Don’t do business with book it .com total scam .
Bookit.com is a very good site to go through I have always put all of our vacations through them
we have lost all our money with this company and more.!!!!! please beware of whom your booking with.
beware of this company. we have lost all our money and more. absolutely devastated.
"Gary, you have not explained what happened? How did you lose all your money? What “more” did you also lose and how?"
Absolutely the worst site ever! Made an error in booking called to change it and was told no but I could book a 2nd room and ultimately have 2 separate Reservations. NOPE NEVER will we book anything with them and advise others to stay away . So I will be a no show..get charged for a room I can't use. Well done Bookit well done
"When you ""Made an error in booking"" that is on you, not the company."
"AVOID Bookit.com. I made a reservation last March and a week later decided to upgrade the room type. They required me to cancel that reservation for a $50 fee and book a new one. I did that and paid for my room in full. When I arrived to the hotel 8 months later, they had no record of my new reservation, only the original one that I canceled and they didn't have the room type I paid extra for. Long story short, the hotel offered me a one night refund for the hassle and error, which Bookit.com acknowledged in December and promised to process within 7-10 days. Twelve weeks later and I'm still having to contact them and ask for my refund. When I asked Bookit why they didn't confirm the hotel had an active reservation for me before arrival, they said they don't do that. So they just took my money and didn't care what happened after that. I'll never do business with Bookit.com."
"I would suggest to use an alternate third party site. We purchased travel from ATL to Saint Lucia PACKAGE booking, entered the travel info for each passenger then clicked bookit,AFTER purchasing a pop-up showed ""there was an error with your flight please call book it immediately"", after several calls to no avail they basically said, we cannot control how many tickets we get and you have to buy the tickets separately. If you choose to use this site I hope your experience goes well.Edited: 2:59 pm, March 13, 2020 "
DO NOT USE THEM. I booked with them and set up the payments 6 months in advance. The flight went fine but when I got to my hotel my reservation was cancelled because bookit never gave them any money. I have called them 4 times in one day and I still have made no progress. They just keep telling me they’ve “paid” for it yet when I check with the desk manager they say they haven’t. They also keep trying to pay the hotel with cards that won’t go through. This was my first time working with a travel agency and I will NEVER book with them again. They are HORRIBLE and are trying to take my money. Save yourself the headache and don’t ever book with bookit.
Not anymore! They took $2600 from me and never paid the resort. Then...they go out of business???? https:/…

"We lost around 3000 CAD. When we called the Aeromexico today, they said we were not in their passenger list, and as Bookit hadn't provided us with an air ticket number, we can't insist on that we had paid for it. We have been trying to contact Bookit via email or phone to get our ticket number so that we can claim it from Aeromexico( rebooking is available until October 31), but they haven't replied to our emails and their telephone numbers have a voicemail saying that they couldn't answer due to ""out of normal operation."" It seems that the only option is to go to our bank's dispute department. Our bank recommended us to keep all emails btw Bookit and us. Although Bookit sent us a refund confirmation for the hotel accommodation (a week ago), not the all amount they confirmed to refund was deposited to our bank account. Overall we could only get 1/4 of what we had paid. Our lesson: we will never ever book our vacation again through an online booking company. Booking directly with the hotel and the airline is the best option!"
"Buyer beware....do not recommend!!!! 1. Customer service does not answer your calls. You get a recorded message then finally when you think you get through they hang up on you. 2. They will take your money and not refund it. During the Corona virus all flights were cancelled the whole world was affected by this, but instead they found a loop hole to keep the money. 3.Unauthorize pmts withdrawn from my credit card. No refund yet! This is a scam , not legit, con artists with a business name."
"Don""t do it. I believe they are a fraudulent operation."
Did not pay for our hotel. We had to pay again when we left. No answer on phone or website. Disputing charges t
Booking failed to pay for our resort on March 14 when we paid Bookit On August 9. We were into the fourth day of our vacation when notified they were not paying the resort. we got double billed. a fraud!!!!
"they ripped us off no refund, no replies! phone shut down email shut down. We have a law suite pending"
"Same here...$3550 for a San Jose del Cabo vacation...everything cancelled and just their stupid notice on their website essentially saying ""you're on your own pal...see if your credit card company will help you out...and thank you for booking your trip through Bookit.com!"""
No. Search: Bookit.com scams customers through covid-19 pandemic. Or look up ‘scammed by Bookit.com’ on Facebook
"Samantha, why search elsewhere when you just posted on a complaint topic here which is 13 pages long. Plus there are other complaint and warning topics on the TripAdvisor forums about the company and those topics have been around for a very long time.The issue seems to be that people don’t search or research BEFORE choosing to book with companies like this so they don’t find or see the complaints until it’s too late. They only start searching AFTER they have had problems."
"Avanti,It’s one of the most mind-boggling things to me on these compliant threads that people only research and read reviews after they’ve made the purchase. Do these same people also buy washers and dryers and then check up to see if they bought a quality brand one month into use? Do they buy a car and then afterwards read up on its safety features and performance reviews? It’s absolute madness to go through life this way."
It appears they also think that useful info is on Faceback.
"This company scammed me out of $987.00 related to travel to Mexico in March, just prior to international travel ban. They have refused to refund money from hotel and excursions paid in advance. Found out upon arrival that hotel was cancelled. Found out through hotel, not bookit.com. I will never do business with them again and will continue to pursue a refund. As of now-they are horrible to work with. Stay away."
