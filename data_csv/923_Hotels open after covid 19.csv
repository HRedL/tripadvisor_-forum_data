Any idea when hotels and holiday let's will open after covid 19..We are booked in for the industrial fortnight.. Keeping my fingers crissesd
There is no confirmed date for hotels to reopen but mid July is potentially the earliest.Don't know how that fits in with your proposed dates.
"A possible date of 4th July has been mooted, but this cannot be confirmed until late June.Even if they can open, activities will be restricted as social distancing will still be in place.Edited: 2:11 pm, May 27, 2020 "
I'm wondering how the 'spot lockdown' will work for such businesses. Ditto restaurant or smaller cafes when they've all had to get food stocked up
"@Toopaz - I guess it depends exactly how the local restrictions are being introduced and perhaps more importantly, policed.One of the things being suggested by some scientists some time ago was that you could not deal with the whole country as a single entity and it might be prudent to have a cordon sanitaire set up in places as and when required."
"Not quite sure what ""the industrial fortnight"" is, but I can't see Hotels etc being open before July, and some might not 're-open at all."
"In South Wales we used to have a 'stop fortnight' when all of the heavy industry, mines, steelworks etc closed down at the same time. I reckon 'industrial fortnight' refers to the same thing. Ours was the first two weeks in August, but different areas had different weeks.Anyway, I love Torquay and the area around Torbay, but it wouldn't be much fun for me to go there this summer. I'd be in pieces trying to avoid getting too close to other people, and I imagine that it will still be a very popular destination for day trippers as well as holidaymakers."
Any that havent gone bankrupt or decided to close for good.
"That's a good point. The whole point of the support put in place for businesses was to help stop them closing down, but we don't yet know how well it will have worked. The reckoning will come later on."
"I know some hotels, gyms and hairdressers which fall amongst the highest risk and so last to open places round here are planning on the possibility that they may be permitted to open from 4th July. However that is a) guesswork extrapolating from other commentary on other business types and b) they are treating that as the earliest possible option and they may have to push things back if the required permissions don't appear for that timescaleSo the answer to the OPs implied question as to whether their trip can go ahead has to be a solid, 'Maybe'Unsatisfying I realise, but the timescales havent been announced directly,, so everyone is guessing to a large degree."
In what country are you asking about hotels??? Ive heard that in Spain they are hoping for them to be open from 1st July but nothing officially confirmed yet. Hope you get your holiday this year. Lou
Torquay is not in Spain.
"Absolutely.On the basis this is posted on the Devon forum, safe I think to assume the OP seeks information on Devon, not Spain ??"
The Government has asked hospitality businesses to prepare to open for 4th July but this is subject to each individual business being ready and having a COVID-19 Secure Policy in place. It’s also subject to change if deaths and infections increase again.
"Have businesses been informed on what the Covid-19 secure policy ought to contain, and will it have to be approved before being allowed to reopen?"
"It's looking increasingly like 4th July will be the date hotels and self-catering get to open. There is already quite a lot of info out there on what businesses can do to ensure their premises are clean and safe, and there will be official Government guidelines once the date is formally announced. It's noticeable that attractions are starting to get ready; the Paignton & Dartmouth Steam Railway is announcing that it will reopen ""very soon"", whilst Paignton Zoo will open bookings on Tuesday 23rd June for an early July opening. Sadly Living Coasts in Torquay will not reopen, the venue was struggling financially and this was exacerbated by having to close. The animals have all been found homes."
"Kents Cavern in Torquay reopens from 11th July. Pre-booking is essential, and can be done via their website from 4th July."
"One wonders what, if anything, will happen to the site of Living Coasts. It has had rather a sad and chequered past but my wife has happy memories of the ballroom when it was the Marine Spa many years ago. I could never really understand why Living Coasts wasn't incorporated into Paignton Zoo and the site used for something else - multi-screen cinema perhaps?"
"I suspect a few of the animals will end up at Paignton and Newquay zoos, which are part of the same group as Living Coasts - although the owners say that the future of those zoos is also uncertain if visitor numbers do not pick up. What to do with the site? I doubt it will become a cinema, as there is already a multiplex in Paignton, and there are already plans to create a new multiplex in Torquay by moving the Central Cinema to a new site in Union Street, that was formerly occupied by the BHS store. Personally I'd favour it returning to a swimming complex with indoor and outdoor pools, and possibly incorporate Beacon Cove which has become rather neglected. However Torbay Council is pretty much on its knees now financially, and unless the UK Government comes up with the finance as a job creation scheme, any proposals would have to come from private developers."
"Paignton Zoo has now announced its reopening plans.On Monday 6th and Tuesday 7th July, the Zoo will open for Annual Pass Holders only. You must book a time slot.From Tuesday 8th July the Zoo will be open to all. If you are buying tickets or are an Annual Pass Holder you must book a time slot online, at the Zoo's website. Slots can be booked up to two weeks in advance. Note that slots must also be booked for any children under 3, even though they are admitted free. https://www.paigntonzoo.org.uk/If you have a Childminder Pass, complimentary ticket, an existing pre-paid ticket, Welcome Return or a Zooper ticket, please call 01803 697500 to book your time slot. If you are an Annual Pass holder or day guest and are experiencing any problems at all with booking online, then please call us and we will be able to assist you."
"Although it is good to see signs of life and businesses opening up, I would like to point out that this is not happening after covid 19 - hotels and businesses are opening with the continuing risk of covid 19. Please be very careful!"
">>>>>Hotels open after covid 19As poster above says, anything happening in the short term is NOT ""after covid 19""Covid 19 is still around and likely to be for the rest of 2020 and probably in to 2021 (maybe all of it).While the number of deaths in the UK is dropping the UK is still the 3rd worst country in the world for deaths (after USA and Brazil) and as the lockdown eases we could well see the number of cases and deaths rise again.See the warning for a second covid 19 wave on the BBC web site herehttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53159918"
"Unfortunately too many will see this easing of restrictions as the end of C-19, that it’s over. Which as said is certainly not the case. Just because venues are opening it doesn’t mean we should all be flooding to these venues as soon as they open. We all need to still be cautious, no one wants a 2nd huge wave and we are back to lockdown which would be so difficult to reinstate and make people stick to it.I see holidays as a privilege which I will waive this year and enjoy the fantastic countryside near to where I live. Too many of the small holiday villages around the country are just not suitable for social distancing. Crowded streets does not sound like a recipe for a 2nd wave.Stay safe and be sensible."

"@ # 23 - the most pertinent sentence in the article you link to is this one:""The prime minister warned that all steps were “reversible” if cases begin to increase again."""
4th July
"With local outbreaks now appearing, the confidence I was feeling about moving forward is dissipating once again...how many more flare up's will we see if large numbers go bonkers again this weekend when a load of pubs open up again."
