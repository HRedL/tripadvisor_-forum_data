由于疫情无法出行，定的巴塞罗那到格拉纳达的机票不知道能不能退，是伏林航空的。飞猪定的，客服让自己关注航司政策，但是上不了伏林的官网
"              Vueling官网上的说法如下，大意是可以免费改签（付差价）到2021年3月27日前。但是，我不清楚这个政策是否只适合在Vueling官网购票的顾客，在这里并没有提及，但有个TA的帖子上说有要求。你需要通过Vueling的系统改签，由于你是在飞猪买的，你还是需要和飞猪的代理去撕，这就是从代理处购票的劣势。https://www.vueling.com/en/flexflyFlexibility for your current Bookings*We're adapting to the exceptional situation we are currently facing, so if you have a flight with us to travel between 13 and 31 March, you can change the date of your flights without paying the usual fee.You can change your flight to any other available flight operated by Vueling until 27th March 2021, on the same route.You'll only pay the fare difference, if there is one.Valid for all fares and flights operated by Vueling (also available for flights operated by LEVEL Europe, booked through Vueling).You can only change the date once per flight in the Booking (except for the TimeFlex fare which allows unlimited changes).It will only be possible to make changes if none of the flights of your reservation have been flown.What´s more, if the situation continues past 31st March, at Vueling we promise to make this flexibility policy available for flights departing after that date."

              第一，目前只能改签。第二，建议和飞猪之上购买的代理商直接沟通。第三，如果代理商不行了，再与官网客服沟通，邮件或者电话都可以，提供自己的票号，直接询问相关政策。
              找代理改签，如果你是伏林航空官网买的就可按官网操作进行，有代理这一步还需要自己去协调
              现在肯定有很多人进这个网站，所以你进不去，建议你继续联系客服，告诉他这个情况，他就可以给你往上反映
              安心坐等你购买的航班取消了，自然会退款的。看现在欧洲疫情，欧洲境内航班很快都会取消。
              可以试试打西班牙的伏林航空的客户联络中心电话：+34931518158
              不能退，可以改签，在规定的日期内，关注官网。                                        
              我觉得你可以问问下面的这个wangxinpeis，她之前有和你一样的问题，你问问她吧                                        
              伏林官网可以看吧 你查下 但伏林很坑的 当时我们定的一程因为超售没有座位                                        
              机票不能退只可以改签，建议与官网客服沟通，提供自己的票号直接询问。
              目前没有相关政策出台，巴塞罗那飞格拉纳达的航班是正常的。                                        
              这个只能关注该航司官网咯，内陆段可能会比较难退改                                        
              先与航空公司沟通
              Sorry，这是我去年去的，没办法帮到你                                        
              现在退了吗？上伏林航空需要科学上网工具
