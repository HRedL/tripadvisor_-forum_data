I'm flying to Jamaica on July 17. Does anyone know if I can book and stay at Airbnb instead of a hotel or resort that was inspected for Covid-19? I'm familiar with 'Covid-19 resilient corridor'.
"I think I am correct when I say that individual Airbnb’s are being certified to open, but there is not a blanket opening of all Airbnb’s."
You do realize that you need a confirmed reservation before flying out or you won’t be allowed to enter Where did you plan to stay?Treehouse in Negril seems like a safe option.Will you get a test/results prior to going to Jamaica? Advisable PEACE!
"I highly suggest that you use a travel agent even if you book with Airbnb. I was looking at some villas on VRBO and decided to use my travel agent to reserve one, only to find out that the Villa Specialist on VRBO is not legit. I shudder to think the amount of money I may have lost if I decided to deal directly with the Villa Specialist. Do your homework before reserving during these times."
I would make a reservation even today but I'm not sure if any Airbnb will get accepted at the airport. I think it is safe to wait a bit with accommodation if I'm not flying until July 17. Then I might just take a chance.I'm flying into Montego Bay.

"Based on your profile, that is your villa. Can you explain to us the Covid regulations for Villas in Jamaica?"
"I am looking at reserving a villa as well and read about an app that has to be downloaded prior to arrival or at the airport but cannot find out much more details than that. I have looked on the Visit Jamaica website and on the government's website. If anyone has any information, I would also appreciate any assistance."
Look for jamcovid19 appDownload it before you travel to save having to download when you land in Jamaica
Thank you! We normally stay at an all inclusive but wanted to try something different this year.
"Renaee - you might have to try something different in a year or two....every tourist dwelling - villa, AirBnB, hotel - MUST be certified Covid compliant before they can accept guests. Hotels and resorts have first priority, then villas and AirBnBs."
"I was thinking that earlier today. My husband will be so thrilled because he is a creature of habit and was not so excited about the villa even though it had a cook, driver, security and over 200 wonderful reviews a few of which I talked to personally. I think he was afraid that he would spend our food budget on Red Stripe. Haha! Just a joke - kinda. It is our anniversary week so are we celebrating or drowning our sorrows? :) Thanks everyone. Safe travels to all."
Did you end up staying in an Airbnb as I have booked one for August
