"Hi, Has the Tourism Minister got any date in sight for lifting restrictions yet?"
"Hi, A report released yesterday suggests a staggered approach with most businesses, schools and tourist sites open by the end of July. Cheers"
Thanks for reply. Does this include allowing International Arrivals again
"Hi,It doesn’t really specify that but in theory the domestic and international flight ban will be over by 1st June. It really depends on whether immigration start reissuing VOAs and visa exemptions. Cheers"
"Thanks, Wasn't aware it was June. We are due to arrive again Mid August, Fingers Crossed. Take Care. Thanks"
"I personally would not get too excited about going to Bali in the short term. I know for a fact that the numbers in Indonesia are very high, even though it is not published. be careful please I just hope they do not open the borders just to help the local economy."
"Im not to be honest, I agree. My other option I was thinking about was to consider Perth in January and use my flights with Cathay Pacific. Chances are you guys wont be accepting Visitors in January"
"Since May 7, 2020 all public transports in Indonesia can run with social distancing, maximum of 50 percent of the capacity for who have task in Covid-19, government officer, who have death relatives. All must have health certificate and task letter. It is gradually rerun and at least will be normal at June 1, 2020. Nowadays there are flights from Jakarta to Surabaya and Medan.Tourism maybe open area per area, Bali maybe the first, because Recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia. But there are no signs, Indonesia will open for foreign tourists soon."
Bali is not likely to have any Australian tourists for a long time. Our government wouldn't be trusting figures coming out of Indonesia for one second.

We’re booked for Bali and Perth for November. I don’t expect Australia to be ‘open’. Even if so may well be restricted to people who haven’t visited xyz which may include Indonesia.
Notapigsty...our Govt in Aus began relaxing restrictions here with domestic travel in the second phase...however our PM stated that international travel and tourism would be the last to be opened back up and not in the medium term.
Sarwa yet again you are underplaying the situation in the region....to say Bali will be opening up soon is one thing but other countries travel advice especially for Australia is do not travel.....you have been underplaying the situation on here for some time with many people asking you to stop...please listen
You might be able to get into Bali however getting home again might be difficult. I wouldn't risk it this year.
Each country will have it's own rules on when to re open their borders. Bali may but don't expect Australia to open to foreign visitors for some time yet Mabe 2021 if they get a vacine.
"Post 14The PM has suggested that Australians will be able to travel to NZ, and via versa before the end of year."
"Gidget, I mentioned at least will be normal at June 1, 2020, but certainly can be later.Tourism maybe open area per area, Bali maybe the first, because Recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia. On May 8, 2020 Bali has 300 confirmed cases with 195 has been recovered or the recovery rate is 65 percent, the best in Indonesia. The death is 4 or mortality rate is 1.3 percent. Indonesia is not make national lock down, only make PSBB or large scale of social restriction area per area. Jakarta has PSBB, but Bali has no PSBB.Certainly domestic transportation will be run first and then international flights. For domestic flights, there are flights from Jakarta to Surabaya and Medan and from Yogyakarta to Makassar with 4 airlines, not all airlines have flown yet. The ticket is expensive and use maximum price top limit is allowed, because all flights only use maximum 50 percents seats of its capacity. Passengers must also have health certificate of Rapid test or PCR test. And it will add the cost."
"Even IF travel is allowed anytime soon, you should expect to have to quarantine 2 weeks on arrival and again when you return home. The virus has not been destroyed, so really nothing has changed.Until a vaccine is available, don't expect normal."
Bali Governor wants Bali as the first of Green Zone in Indonesia.balipost.com/news/2020/05/10/121007/Penangan…
"According to the statistics on the worldometer website. Indonesia has a testing rate of 552 persons per 1 million.Australia and the US are testing roughly 30000 per 1 million.The testing rate in Indonesia is one of the lowest on the graph, below that of Bangladesh."
"Massive test of PCR and not Rapid Test is important, so the president has urged it. The laboratories can do the swab test are increasing, include veterinary laboratories.WHO has appreciated Vietnam, the data of Vietnam is,No deathHas only 288 positive Covid-19 casesRecovery rate 83.7 percentTest per 1 M population 2,681Population 95 millionsIndonesia has,Test per 1 M population 579Population 270 millionsI agree the swab test must be increased to 270/95x2,681=7,619 test per 1 M population, but Indonesia get advantage with its archipelago, so local transmission among island is rather difficult, most of the cases is in Java, mainly in Jakarta and surrounding. Even Thousands Islands in Jakarta has no cases at all."
"Sarwa just doesn't get it.He is the only person on this forum who takes seriously the figures he quotes. At no time has he conceded that the numbers published by the health ministry may be inaccurate, not even by a small factor. Bali can say it's open for business all it likes but is it really open for business when the very customers they are reliant on for recovery are not departing from their own countries???? Indonesia will be among the last destinations to be lifted from the Do Not Travel list and it's due to the fact that the Australian govt does not believe the figures that Sarwa quotes.Cheers"
Spot on FreshPrince
"Changing fastly.When Indonesia announced the first case of Covid-19, Indonesia only has one laboratory can analyze the swab test and then Indonesia has 4 laboratories, but all are still in Jakarta. Nowadays Indonesia has 57 laboratories can analyze the swab test. And about 50 other laboratories have capabilities to analyze the swab test, but are not yet get the permit such as Police Laboratories and Army Laboratories.Nowadays Indonesia do 4,000 to 5,000 swab test per day from the target 10,000 swab test per day and still wait for another imported swab test equipment, etc. South Korea do 15,000 swab test per day."
"I feel like I’m stuck in a loop, a Sarwa loop. It’s like listening to Donald Trump, you know what’s coming out is rubbish but you just can’t wait to see exactly how bad it can get. Now, where’s that groundhog again."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdFl__NlOpA
"Sarwa, hard to believe anything he says given that he has been proven wrong about much of what he has posted. i have his immortal mantra ""Bali is Safe"" posted above my toilet to remind me"
"On May 7 there are accumulative 134,151 PCR test and on May 12 there are accumulative 165,128 PCR test. It is PCR rest only and not include Rapid test, because Rapid rest are also done by non-government. The number of Rapid test certainly is bigger than PCR test.So, in 5 days there are 30,978 PCR test or the average is 6,195."
"Sorry Sarwa, we appreciate your efforts, but we only believe the information that comes from reliable sources, such as Colin Powell in front of the UN"
"Those 300,000 rapid test kits obtained from the Netherlands (but made in China) have low accuracy, falsified production origins, and are sold at ten times the cost to acquire. I don’t think your “advisories” are particularly reassuring, Sarwa.https://majalah.tempo.co/read/laporan-utama/…"
"I think ""GREG"" has been getting inside info. Yes that is about what they are saying. Indonesia including Bali is rife with sick people, many who have no idea they are sick.Edited: 9:22 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Oh Greg, what a classic!I am also very happy that things are changing fastly, it's always exciting when they do."
"Rapid test certainly is not accurate, because it is the anti body test. If someone has got Covid-19, but the antibody is not yet formed, so the result is negative and it is called as False Negative.Whereas as the antigen test is to test the availability of the virus, so it is very accurate. Antigen test such as swab test or PCR test. Indonesia reported to WHO all the cases based on Antigen test.Rapid test is pre-clinic test and not diagnostic test."
"You know what else is not accurate, Sarwa? The misinformation you post on this forum."
"I read there are 2000 plus cases of dengue fever but as the symptoms are so similar to covid they are being diagnosed as dengue as most doctors don't have the means to test. I was also reading that the Governor wants a ""new Bali"" to include such things as hotel protocols in respect to covid safe, no entry without a return flight and no bogons, so Bali can get back its reputation of respectability, ie no thongs or singlets. He wasn't specific on how that one was going to be tackled. Apparently, they will invite countries to enter and first off the block are China and South Korea - but not the large Chinese tour groups. It will be interesting."
"Tazmo I think that sounds great, Bali has gone downhill over the years so bringing back a bit of respectability could only be a good thing but unfortunately I don't think it would last. The mighty dollar would win and the 'walking wallets' as a lot of tourists feel like these days would be allowed in no matter who and where they're from."
"If I can't wear singlet and thongs, if I choose to, in a hot tropical location, I won't be going."
"Dengeu fever is easy to detect, just check the thrombocyte."
Sarwa is someone from tourism minister maybe?She is promoting tourists to come back to Indonesia early by promoting health safety in the country? LOL
"Number 39, you may read Wikipedia about Dengeu Fever. Note, thrombocytes is also called as platelets, so there are Thrombocytopenia."
"Hi, A recent hopeful - possibly crazy optimistic - news item.  https:/…Cheers"
"In number 23, May 11, 2020 I have mentioned about 10,000 target test per day, may be it is optimistic. But optimism is better than pessimism for the immunity.On May 19, 2020 Indonesia does 12,276 test per day. it is mainly based on Real Time PCR in 66 laboratoria and Molecular Fast Test in 14 laboratoria. Both kinds of test is very accurate, because test the antigen, test the availability of virus."
"Nice spin, Sarwa. Indonesia hasn’t come anywhere meeting the 10,000 tests per day that Jokowi requested a month ago. Stop moving the goal posts.My question is how many tests are undertaken each day in Bali. You haven’t answered that because you can’t."
"10, 000 test per day certainly not in Bali, but whole of Indonesia, South Korea do 15,000 test per day is also in South Korea and not Seoul only."
"What other countries are doing is irrelevant to this discussion other than to highlight the inadequacies of the Indonesian government. If there are no testing numbers being released for Bali, why should it be assumed that it’s all fine there?"
"Until May 18, 2020 Bali has tested more than 64,000 using Rapid test and almost 7,000 test using PCR. Only PCR or Swab test is reported to WHO. Population of Bali is around 4.5 million, so Tests per 1 million population is more than 1,500, whereas all Indonesia average is around 750.Analysis is based on facts and not assumed."
"Hi,My understanding is that data for testing numbers is not released by the Indonesian government. They may have releaseD info to the WHO but testing figures are not available to the general public. Cheers"
"Thanks Paul. That’s certainly the same information I’ve received.We’ll continue to assume your information is rubbish, Sarwa."
I read this morning that the Indonesian travel minister is aiming to reopen to tourism Oct 1st. I take it that applies to Bali and my upcoming trip in the beginning of September is in danger. Can anyone confirm that here? Thank you!
"Wait until mid-June, because in June there are many new policies. Wait of effect of Ied Day gathering, if there are no spike, so release of the restrictions can be done, area by area or even by sub area.Indonesia has made its own rapid test and PCR test, so Garuda Indonesia can do rapid test to its passengers as Emirates Airlines do and make rule that only airlines do rapid test can visit Indonesia or certain area of Indonesia."
"Hi,I have just spoke to Cathay Pacific who our flights are booked with for August, They said they are confident all flight operations resume early July???. I said about the news article about Bali announcing earliest October for Visitors, They said it will be before that???Not sure how they know this to be honest. They also said the Transit restrictions through Hong Kong Airport will be lifted soon.Edited: 1:24 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"My girlfriend and I have Cathay Pacific flights booked to Bali in mid-August, similar to David ^. We are hoping to fly Dublin - Hong Kong - Bali. Not sure if it will be possible but fingers are crossed.In my view it seems likely that Bali will be accepting tourists by August, but the issue stopping us could be Ireland not allowing travel or airlines not being able to get us there. Anyone else in the same boat? Thanks. :)"
"Number 47, you can see the figure on Worldometer. Certainly Indonesia release the data everyday and public can know it. There are Google for it."
#52 I have colleagues at Cathay Pacific who say the restrictions through HKG will be lifted in the coming weeks. So you should be good to take your flight. No idea if the Irish government will be enforcing the 14 day quarantine on return though.
Hi does this include being able to Transit through?
"#54 Thanks for the info! if the flight is going and Bali is open then the only thing in the way will be Ireland gov restrictions. Still too early to say at this point, thanks again!"

"I see contradictions in the reports of the Bali reopening... It's been well publicized by the Indonesian govt in them saying they think Bali will be ready for reopening for international tourists in Oct. However, it seems that Bali govt is saying they will reopen in July...I don't see how a local govt can overrule its national govt, especially if the national govt closed the borders to tourists - but hey... I guess we will see how this all unfolds.I have a trip to Bali, Nusa Lembongan, and Labuan Bajo in early July. I want to hold out hope, but I think it's best to reschedule. I'm connecting through Taiwan going and Hong Kong coming back home. The transit situation is non-existent right now as they aren't letting non-citizens through. I would hate to travel and the transit borders get closed down again (if they reopen at all this early summer). There are too many shaky factors for my trip to go as planned."
"Hi Cat S,Bali will try to open to domestic tourists in June/July and then to ASEAN nations later and finally to international travellers in October. The Bali governor won’t overrule Jakarta but international travel is dependent on visas being reintroduced, currently only kitas/Kitap holders can enter Indonesia and embassies are not issuing tourist or social visas, so until that changes international travel for most won’t resume. Cheers"
"Thank you, PaulosussexI figured as much..I was just wondering why the Bali governor seemed a bit defiant, lol.Edited: 4:17 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"Hi,Well he is concerned that local transmissions are increasing so to some extent it’s posturing and saying we’ll make the final decision thanks Jakarta, but saying that he’s also aware of the huge financial damage staying closed is causing so won’t delay unnecessarily. Cheers"
"You may read Recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia number 73.Certainly, Bali will open for domestic tourists first, if it can, Most countries do it, but Greece will open for foreign tourists starting on June 15, 2020."
"Hi Cat S,regardless of whether Bali opens or not your main problem could be your transit countries. It doesn't matter for instance if Bali opens if Taiwan or HK isn't open to USA or Bali flights/travellers. You may even find that your US - Taiwan or Bali -HK OR HK - US flight could be cancelled due to travel restrictions. This for instance happened to us for May already in early March. Our flight from Munich to Bali was via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. As soon as Singapore declared travel restrictions into Singapore they banned German flights and transit passengers then Singapore Airlines cancelled our MUC-SIN flights. They did not however cancel our SIN-DPS, DPS-SIN or even the SIN-MUC flight."
"Yes, Not a PigstyThis is exactly why I'm rescheduling my July 2020 trip to next July. I made this decision 2 months ago. It's just a bit shaky to travel to Asia right now from the West. Going to Bali, I connect in Taiwan. Coming home, I connect in Hong Kong.We already know what's happening with transit operations in those 2 places. My question was more to just get clarification on the contradictions. It pains me to cancel my July trip, but I need for things to be more stable before I venture so far from home. There are two many factors that rely on each other. If one goes wrong, it can go down like a house of cards lol."

If you have to quarantine for 2 weeks. How would that work with a 2 week holiday?
"Please read, Recovery of Covid-19 in Bali, the best in Indonesia number 79 about the growth of new cases.UK maybe better than all of Indonesia. In UK the growth of new cases in the last 14 days is maximum 1.5 percent and on May 25, 2020 the growth of new cases is 0.6 percent.Taiwan is very good with 13 of the last 14 days has no case.The problem is when Bali/Indonesia open the international flights and also the VOA. Nowadays they are afraid of local transmission rather than imported cases. Imported cases can still happen from migrant workers, but relatively more easy to handle, because they enter Indonesia in certain airports and ports only."
Is it true anyone with covid in Bali gets moved to Java and counted there?
"Even from Bali a mother and a daughter rent an ambulance to go to East Java, but in the check point in Bali they have been catched and they are health examined. They are healthy and they must go back to origin in Bali. I do not know about the ambulance driver fate.There are hundred private micro buses want go from Jakarta or West Java to East Java, but at the check point the micro buses are held by the police, because private vehicle are not rental vehicle. I think the owner will get big loss and the driver maybe will be fired.East Java has received more than 400 thousands of its workers from Jakarta and West Java since more than a month ago. So maybe there are spike of Ied Day gathering. Wait until June 7, 2020 to know about it. Who's know there are no spike and Indonesia can make more New Normal area. In number 67, UK can make significant drop of the growth of new cases in 14 days from 1.5 percent to 0.6 percent. I hope Indonesia can do as UK, if discipline."
Just read an article in the Sydney Morning Herald stating that the required documents needed for the exemption of flight restrictions in Indonesia are freely available on the streets of Jakarta for $10 for anyone wanting to circumvent the rules. I think it will be a while before it's under control there sadly.
"I was planning to take a group to Bali in mid September, should I push this back to mid October?"
"October 2021 perhaps!!! I don't think any of us has any idea really, but we are all itching to get back."
"There is so much contradictory information about planned changes to entry regulations that it seems impossible to tell anything at all at the moment.Is there no government site which lists current and planned future entry restrictions? I could not find such a site, but I can hardly believe that it does not exist."
"Correct Tom, no one knows what's happening at the moment. As others have said, the government will be torn between keeping covid under control and opening up to tourism again so people can start earning money. Keep an eye on this forum, I have no doubt that as soon as the government announces that VOAs are available again, someone will post it here."
"The president in his speech has mentioned that will aware to open tourism.Indonesia is not as Spain, Greece or Thailand which tourism contribute a lot to its GDP. Bukittinggi has been opened for domestic tourists. Maybe it will be followed by other area in Indonesia, but this is not Central Government decision, every area can do their own decision based on Covid-19 condition."
"Hi, Anymore news on this yet? Thanks"
"There are domestic flights, but need health certificate and assignmemt letter, Many passengers cannot fulfill it and must do cancellation and airlines must make full refund. Lion Air Group has 2 times canceled all flights, first from 28 to 31 May 2020 and the second from 5 June until further notice. I think for opening foreign flights are further away."
"Thanks for reply, Is August likely to be still closed to International Arrivals"
"Jakarta can handle the Covid-19 well, but Jakarta is very careful to open Jakarta, even for the surrounding Jakarta people, need paper.One thing that international flights are the authority of Central Government."
Singapore airlines cancelled my flights from London to Denpasar via Singapore this last week..... 19th July coming back 30th July. Not a suprise really!!
Sorry to hear that! Why are they still letting you book on there site? Its wrong. Are you re-scheduling
"@75To answer your question,No, there is no site atm that lists current or planned future entry restrictions? There are only website that states which foreigners are not allowed for entry.Indonesian government would want to look at other countries in the world, what they were doing, and copy some of the policies to be applied locally. Maybe add some ketchup local-made policies."
"Sarwa G,As a BANDUNG resident, you seem to be very confident of what sort of information you provided to the lads here. You seem to know everything about Indonesia, you are mingling at Bali forums where you are not a resident, you are even representing Jakarta here, which you do not have any clue about. Where all I see is you are OVERLY CONFIDENT about everything, and I can see that you positively believe everything you see and read on local media outlet.You are saying that for people residing around Jakarta needs paper to go to Jakarta, who on earth is really making you believe that is being the real situation?I did see the news that police are ‘securing the highways’, ‘securing all the checkpoints’ to Jakarta. However, the fact is, some of my employees are returning back home for Idul Fitri to their homes all around Jakarta safely and sound, using a hired travel bus! And eventhough each of them had a rapid test before the travel, seriously no police had ever been in their sight for their whole journey home! This is FACT. I must say even our housemaid who has came back to her home at Banten, has now even came back safely to our home at Jakarta, and without any police in sight on the trip, that is within this ‘super-lockdown’ era. Hard to swallow the facts, huh?To me, what you are stating to the lads here, mostly are jibber jabber, and that is potentially misleading to people that don’t do research!————————————————————————————————————————————————————Post #81Jakarta can handle the Covid-19 well, but Jakarta is very careful to open Jakarta, even for the surrounding Jakarta people, need paper.One thing that international flights are the authority of Central Government.Edited: 1:16 am, June 07, 2020 "

You should say that the fact is, those passengers wanting to fly are simply ignorant. We are a country with generations of people that has been ignorant to safety for decades! Okay, I am not talking about everyone in the country, but simply most of the people are like that. Should I say that for example, seat belts are not considered essential, other than using it only for not getting fines from the police. At 2020, we Indonesians are still slowly learning to get used to seat belts and slowly starting to embrace is as part of safety essentials! What about motorcycles running at the wrong lane, do you need pictures for me to proof that this is an example of ignorance by our people? How many times did you see old lads flying in an airplane with their phones not in airplane mode? They simply refuse to do it! Not that they aren’t aware there is an airplane-mode feature on their phones! How many times did you feel that a mother pushing baby strollers, pregnant mother, or disabled people coming into an elevator was not prioritized by the general people in Indonesia? Was all these clear enough for you of the real situation of our nation?Back to the topics, many first generation flyers are simply ignorant that they believe they ‘can’ get through in the airport without all the proper document needed for fly.

Thanks DNS-Han. You are like a breath of fresh air.
"Related to number 85,First I born in Bandung and then live in Bekasi, so I know Jakarta. Police check randomly the SIKM, exit permit letter to/from Jakarta. Bus can exit Jakarta with special sticker. Usually I frequent to Bandung and Jakarta, but not in Covid-19 time. My car has Bandung license and it will make police in Jakarta or near Bandung stop me and I must turn around. But if you use public transport. it more easy. From Jatibening Tol to Dukuh Atas there are microbus with passengers maximum 4 persons and pay Rp35,000 each, whereas in normal condition must pay Rp20,000 each. Alternatively you can use commuter train and TransJabodetabek.Your employees go home for Iedul Fitri are lucky, and your housemaid are not commuter person."
Sarwa we now have DNS-Han nobody is listening to you anymore.
"Related to number 87,Maybe Bali can be opened with other provinces with very minimal Covid-19 patients. But I think it is difficult to realize.Now that they have learned their lesson (this is important), they should start to obey the rules, and get a test before flying! I agree with you.What do you think about 2 incidents in Makassar when corpses in isolation are carried by force by about a hundred persons and some of them bring sharp weapons. The swab test are positive. The other similar incident is in North Sulawesi. Need suggestion from you."
"Dianne, I talk about data and facts. There are announce, release and claim. You can claim and everyone can claim."
"Related to number 19 and 20.Today, June 8, 2020 based on reliable data from Worldometer, Indonesia has done 1,511 tests per million population, still below 7,619, so the president has urged to increase the tests up to 20,000 tests per day.The other countries besides Vietnam with not so many tests are Taiwan with 3,085 and Japan with 2,486 tests per million population.Japan can handle Covid-19 well due to Japan usual to do tracing for flu and TBC patients, Indonesia is also usual tracing Bird Flu and TBC patients. Japan are not shake hand among others, but bent down, Indonesia Moslem not shake hand, but touch the tip of the middle finger to other, but not touch, if different gender. Japan has culture of using mask, mainly if someone feel unwell, because they do not want the other unwell also. Indonesia must discipline of using mask."
"Got this today,Thank you for contacting us. The Indonesian Govt is constantly reviewing its border policy and we will announce at the earliest possible time when the travel restriction for foreign visitors is lifted. However, no exact date has been made so far. Best."
"I think Indonesia open the border not too soon, because for overall Indonesia Covid-19 is still not good, Bali recently is not good yet."
"Hi, Who was that off?"
"Transportation Ministry has released a new regulation that starting on June 10, 2020 fly form one airport need only ID Card and health certificate. Rapid Test certificate is only valid for 3 days, whereas PCR certificate is valid for 7 days. Only destination for Jakarta need SIKM, exit permit Jakarta letter. Lion Air Grup initial to fly again."
Bali is planning to reopen for International travelers on September 11th.Thanks.
"The Sept 11 date was mentioned as a possible opening date by a local official. However, it is NOT confirmed. Cases in Indonesia are on the rise and medical facilities are being overwhelmed . Foreigners already here on various visas and stay permits are still grappling with the process to extend their immigration permissions thru Sept 20. Right now there are severe limitations on who can enter Indonesia, no tourist visas are being issued currently. In other words, I would NOT plan on a Sept 11 opening. We have many tourists stuck here who are behaving badly btw."
"Hi, Bali is supposed to open it's doors to international tourists on September 11.As a scuba dive company, we have been operating normally with updated safety procedures suggested by the local government. Therefore, touristic activities are also available/open for bookings.Currently, the government is only allowing domestic travellers, but hopefully everything will go as planned, and we will be able to welcome international tourists once again.Good luck with your travels!"
"Hi David,Just announced that Bali will not open in September. Looks like it will be until the end of the year."
"Official link please, can't find anything about it."
"Hi,It’s just a news story from cnn Indonesia at the moment but it’s here: https:/…Cheers"

"Hi,I disagree. Here is a quote from the head of the Bali hotel Restaurant association. ""I Gusti Ngurah Rai Surya Wijaya, confirmed on Wednesday (12/8/2020). ""The possibility that the plan to open September 11 to foreign tourists has been postponed. The situation of the Covid-19 condition in Indonesia continues to increase, especially local transmissions, he said. He said that after going through a closed and limited meeting, the opening plan for foreign tourists was postponed. Apart from the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia has not decreased, a number of countries have experienced a second wave of the Covid-19 cases.""The 11th date has only ever been mentioned by the Bali governor. The national government have only ever said they were looking at a phased reopening when conditions were favourable. Unfortunately every newspaper and vested interest pounced on the 11th date as fact when it wasn’t and have been repeating and repeating it so it gains some credence. The national government who decide these things have never stated a date so I’m far more inclined to believe the ministers statement yesterday. Even now, the same newspapers that were touting the 11th are writing stories that it will be the end of the year. Cheers"
