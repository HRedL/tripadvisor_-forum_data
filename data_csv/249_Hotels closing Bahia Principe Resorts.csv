"That list should include ""all resorts"" as of the end of this week."
"Mike, what will happen to the perishable foods at the resorts? Will some of it be passed on to the community?"
"If you're still at the resort... We're all pretty good at throwing some money around during our vacation holidays, but these are the times when families on the island really need some help with all the resort closures. If you are able to please consider reaching into your pockets a little more often, these people are really going to need some cash to buy food and necessities."
"wolrac,The Bahia Principe Punta Cana Resorts has closed three resorts in the Bahia Resort complex which are - The Luxury Bahia Esmeralda, the Grand Bahia Aquamarine, the Grand Bahia Bavaro and the Grand Bahia Turquesa resort which was closed in September 2019. This leaves the Luxury Bahia Ambar (adult only), the Grand Bahia Punta Cana (family resort) and the Fantasia Bahia Principe resorts (family) as the ones remaining open. The latter three resorts will not be taking any new bookings until after April 30, however, they are remaining open as per information received from the Bahia group this morning.
