"What do you plan to do? We leave in a few weeks and personally, I do not want to spend my vacation wearing a mask. What is the general consensus?"
"on the plane you need to wear a mask and also in the airport. at the resort you will probably be told a mask has to be worn in common areas, out by the pool/beach areas they will probably have chairs seperated so you shouldn't have to wear a mask then. you should probably go to your resorts website. they will probably tell you exactly what you will need to know."
"And if you leave the resort the mask is mandatory.Walking in the street, entering stores, restaurants, shopping centers etc, and on all forms of public transportation including shared and private airport shuttles. You should also be prepared to have your temperature taken pretty much every place you enter including your resort. In fact, some are randomly checking temperatures during each day. Even places that didn't check temperatures before are doing so now since tourism opened up."
"If you decide to travel, you should abide by the rules/protocols.If you don't want to wear mask, I think it's clear what you should do..."
"Yeah, I think it's best to follow the local rules. As a third year medical student, I am not all that convinced about the efficacy of masks out in public, and the JAMA paper by Aronoff states this : Nonmedical masks may not be effective in preventing infection for the person wearing them. I happen to think it is to a large degree ""virtue signalling"" or ""goodwill signalling,"" like the abundance of flagpins after the 9/11 attacks. But like I said, better to follow the local ordinances in order to keep out of trouble.Edited: 1:09 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"As someone who lives in NYC and personally knew 2 healthy people who died from COVID-19, I respectfully disagree.Many medical and scientific experts are on board with wearing masks in public for the prevention of spread. True, that an n95 is better than a non-medical mask. But something is better than nothing.Look at most of the Asian countries that had a handle on this virus. They started the push of wearing masks in public to combat the virus. It really does make sense."
"Yandoblu,Link please for this paper so we can see date of publication. That seems to go against all recent findings on mask efficacy. Are you American going to med school in Grenada? Just curious.Edited: 2:16 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"I want to correct myself after retreading what you wrote. You said non-medical masks may not protect the person wearing one from being infected. That is consistent with what we’ve been told all along—that masks are to keep us from spreading the virus to others, not to protect us. I’m not sure how taking care of each other like that to reduce virus spread could be considered “virtue signaling” rather than efficacious behavior. It certainly is virtuous to wear them in appropriate situations where social distancing is not possible and/or when directed to by a governing body or a resort where one is taking a vacation by choice. It’s also sound behavior based on medical advice from actual experts. In fact, your Aronoff wants people to wear masks. He just doesn’t want them wearing medical masks because he wants those saved for healthcare workers."
Thanks for the information! I will 100% abide by all rules. Definitely not a rule breaker but my personal opinion is an open aired area with lots of sunshine and breeze seems to be a place you can take that sucker off and breathe. Didn’t mean for this post to turn political. I was just curious what most plan to do. Thanks again!
"https:/…2764955The Aronoff paper is here. April 2020, pretty recent and top notch journal. Yes, I am in the last year at SGU Med School in Grenada and have about 20 years experience in molecular biology before that.Cat , what evidence do you have that a mask would have helped your friends? If you just say they didn't have a mask, and did not survive, I would argue, that alone is not very convincing. Always hard to prove causality."
"That’s the same article I saw and I agree that JAMA is a well-respected journal. It actually does recommend masks, just non-medical ones to save medical supplies for healthcare workers as I said. I’m not sure why you’d be citing it to support your personal opinion that masks are not useful, but rather just virtue signaling."
"Personally I will not go to a resort if a mask is needed. We have been traveling to the area at least 2-4 times a year for over 20 years! It's killing us not to be able to go see our friends, but why risk it! We've had to cancel 1 trip so far and hope we can make the 1 in early December."
Here’s an article today from the Washington Post that discusses the numerous recent studies demonstrating the efficacy of masks:https://apple.news/Aajf7MEm7TOCY3lhvgoATBgI will follow all resort and government guidelines re. masks for our upcoming trip if we go. They’re not asking for masks outside on-resort. It’s no different from what we’re doing in our state and no big deal for me.
I'm not wearing a mask anywhere i'm not required by law to wear one. Virtue signaling will not save anyone.
"The nice thing about masks is you quickly know which people are responsible adults you might like to get to know and which people are selfish and figure as long as they’re comfortable and happy the rest you can die. You don’t wear a mask to protect yourself you wear a mask to protect others from you.Please quit being afraid of a piece of cloth over your face and try to learn to be responsible adult. It won’t kill you I promise and it might save othersI like the posts on here we miss our friends and we want to see them but we won’t do anything to help protect them. Pretty much tells you what you really think about your friends doesn’t itEdited: 4:01 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"""But something is better than nothing""Totally agree with that. We seem to be living in a binary world these days where anything less than 100% effective gets conflated to being ineffective. ""You don’t wear a mask to protect yourself you wear a mask to protect others from you""This doesn't get said nearly enough."
"Great post, Carol! And I love how the anti-mask folks, and all that’s wrapped up in their baseless position, are coopting the term “virtue signaling” at a time like this. Yes, certainly lacking in virtue indeed."
COVID-19 recovery rate is between 97% and 99.75% - i think i'll take my chances.https:/…1
"We booked a trip to the area for the end of August. I messaged the resort and they said masks were needed. That sealed the deal. We booked. We are getting used to it here. They are required to go into any store and I personally believe that if the staff are wearing them to protect us than I should have the same courtesy towards them. Full disclosure ..we got an awesome deal. I wouldn’t pay full price for a resort right now with everything that is going on.Edited: 5:13 pm, June 13, 2020 "
With all the talk of temp checks and screenings nobody has said what will happen if you have a fever. If I show up at customs feeling fine and they gun my forehead and I have a temperature what is going to happen then? They are not going to let me go to the resort and they are not going to let me get back on a plane and go home. Am I going to spend the next 14 days quarantined in a Mexican gymnasium sleeping on a cot? Until this question is answered I will not be doing any international travel.
"BSmithYou’re not taking chances. You’re giving chances. Because you’re wearing the mask not to protect You but up to protect others from you and your chances. I’m really glad that you think it’s OK if you only kill 3% of the people. You are such a generous responsible adult. LOLSince I live in Atlanta I will make a personal request. Stay home. 24 seven. I don’t want to have to take my chances because people like you are selfish and irresponsible. CoEdited: 5:37 pm, June 13, 2020 "

"Traveling with my family of 5 the first week of July to Mayakoba. We will mask in airport, although we not force our 7 year old daughter to wear hers for the duration of the flight. Happy to wear them in transportation if that’s requested. But when we arrive at the resort I don’t expect to have to wear a mask at any time, barring some kind of close contact situation with a group. I will clarify that with the hotel before I arrive. Masking on a beach or in an outdoor setting is asinine."

Thank you everyone for your responses. Am I the worst person in the world to think people should just postpone their trip if they are that scared and expect others to wear a mask during their vacation. Oh man! I really don’t want to be political but it just seems like being judged for not wearing a mask on a vacation is a little ridiculous.
"One of the things I have worked hard on in this 3 months of staying at home is to not be judgmental. No one has any clue what drives anyone to do what they do. I comply with all mask wearing rules in public places, but I do NOT look around to judge who is or is not following ""the rules"". I refuse to police.Personally, I am convinced that mask wearing will become a permanent thing on airplanes and in airports. I don't necessarily agree...but I 100% will comply.I do not want to wear a mask on the beach, during dinner (in my state once you sit down your mask can be removed), or in places where I can social distance. BUT...that is my personal feelings. I will not judge others who feel differently. If I was in a situation where I felt others needed to protect ME, I would stay home...(which is why I have not gone into Wal Mart even with a mask). I am blessed to be healthy, but so many are not. I respect their feelings.Please respect the rights of others, and try to understand their feelings in this super weird time for all of us!!"

"LadyBass,This has absolutely nothing to do with politics. Again, it's about following rules and protocols laid out by foreign governments/businesses. If your resort requires you to wear a mask in certain places or if certain outside shopping areas/restaurants/bars require a mask, what are you going to do? I don't think it's right to be belligerent and/or defiant to staff if you aren't following what is required. If anyone chooses to go down that road, again, expect to deal with consequences. This is why I said earlier that people need to do some soul searching and see if you can really travel in these times. People need to do their research, stay informed, and make the best decision for them. It's no judgment. It's not about just worrying about catching the COVID-19 - there are going to be certain rules/restrictions/requirements in place. You aren't in your home country. Many people are putting off travel until next year because they have admitted that they don't want to deal with the travel restrictions and/or wearing a maskSometimes the sense of entitlement of ""I can do what I want"" just doesn't fly when you aren't in your own country."
"Coral A, Spirit Airlines now requires face masks, just to let you know. Then again all airlines and airports require this. We just purchased a 50 pack of masks from Amazon. We were thinking of getting face shields more so at the airport and on the plane. What are your opinions?"

"Greg JensenAs to curb misinformation and inaccuracies, do you think you could share the source for that news please? Also, isn't the minimum days for self quarantine at least 14 days? This is what is said by the medical/scientific experts. Kateman, I've went to a medical office 2 weeks ago. All of the doctors that I saw had face shields on along with their masks, fyi. I know that some cities require the hair stylists to wear face shields and masks. I think there is something to it in aiding the lower probability of transmission. Remember, viruses can be spread through the mouth, nose, and EYES! You can look up sources to see what medical experts/scientists are saying about wearing one. However, do what you think makes you feel comfortable in traveling. If you want to wear a face shield for an extra layer of protection, I absolutely see both wrong with that.Of course you have the jokesters and cynics that will tell you that you are overreacting, but again, I see nothing wrong with this. I actually think this is a good idea. I'm traveling in 3 weeks to Mexico and we all know of the risks of transmission and spread in airports/planes. I think I will pick up one myself for the trip.I was actually thinking about getting a face shield for when I finally start going back to the nail salon."
"""Twelve passengers who tested negative for coronavirus when boarding a flight test positive upon landing in just five hours late""Can you cite the source of this? It sounds a bit screwy. There is a whole series of events that happens after the initial exposure, before becoming infectious, that has to do with cell entry and proliferation and it takes quite some time. And I don't think it happens in a brief 5 hour window. A more likely explanation is that original tests were false negatives or the subsequent tests were false positives.Here's what I find for the COVID : The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however can be up to 14 days.To be fair, you mentioned that they tested positive, not that they were infectious, but I am still quite skeptical because 5 hours is a very short window."
"The link below gives you some information on the story Greg references. However it does not appear that passengers were tested before they got on the plane to Athens only that were screened. That’s completely different.It does appear Athens has decided to quarantine these passengers for seven days at the Greek governments expense and then retest and if they are not positive they can go on about their businessI think what’s going to have to happen long term is testing at departure. But I’m not sure how that’s going to happen. I Deleigh what I’d like to be able to do is go to some clinic at Hartsfield Atlanta Airport and get tested and have my results with me. We’ll see what happenshttps:/…3fampI asked for an earlier comment made about how do I feel about spirit- mask or no mask I’m not flying spirit. If that’s my only option, I stay home."

"For what it’s worth, it’s not a coincidence that as of the past few days, there are the top 12 worst states for increased Covid, and of those 12 11 are red states, conservative governors with most people following the inadequate leadership of trump.

@34: the low accuracy of some tests can also explain it. https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-t…https:/…coronavirus-testing-basics
Mark M- And the Democratic leadership of New York handled the 'Rona perfectly by sending old folks with the 'Rona back to nursing homes to infect and kill all of the other residents. These forums are not the place for United States political talk.

So you all plan to wear a mask for the rest of your life?
I will only wear a mask if it's mandatory and I have no choice. I haven't worn one so far but I know I will have to wear one on my flight if my holiday goes ahead in August
"Face coverings DO work: Study of coronavirus outbreak on a US warship finds infection rate was 56% for personnel wearing masks and 81% for those without - and they worked better than social distancingUS health officials published a study carried out on the USS Theodore Roosevelt Some 1,000 of the ship's nearly 4,900-member crew tested positive in March The aircraft carrier has been studied by US officials to understand transmission25% difference in infection found between those who did and didn't wear a mask"
"Cool, well I’ll keep that in mind if I decide to get onto a cramped warship with 5,000 other people."
modern warships are not cramped..????........maybe your confusing then with the ye old pirate ships........
i think a charter flight is more packed than the nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt
"Lucky......nice try, NY state went from the worst state for Covid, to now they have the lowest rate of any state for transmission. No deaths per day on. average lately. So, to educate you, the governor of NY showed us what real state leadership is."
"Mark M- Have you read about the antibody studies they have done in NYC? The reason NY cases are way down is because so many people have already had the 'Rona. It burned it's way through NYC like an out of control fire. Other studies have shown that up to 80% of people who test positive for antibodies never had symptoms or had extremely minor symptoms. Whatever a state's ""official"" 'Rona count is you can multiply it by at least 50 but likely by closer to 80."

^^^^^^^^^^That's fantastic news
"That time frame does not seem plausiblePlease keep in mind that the accuracy of quick tests is questionableWhen you say they tested negative before boarding, you don't cite when (was it done a week before the flight, in the airport?)Testing positive five hours later?Sorry for peppering you, but I am an RN in a large Boston hospital, and am familiar with testing, turn around times for results, etcThere are a few missing pieces of information here. IMO."
"Yeah, KK66 I am a med student who jumped on that one too. 5 hours?Anyone who has a grasp of viral entry and proliferation would say that's too short.Turns out the first people were *screened* and the the second group were tested.Talk about a messy experiment."

"At least 17 states across the US have seen COVID-19 infections surge in the last week as record numbers of new cases and hospitalizations continue to sweep through the likes of Florida, Texas and Alabama. Several of the states, mostly in the South, bringing record number of new cases and hospitalizations"
Why are we discussing us case numbers and surges and politics here? This is not the place.
"In all fairness, COVID-19 case numbers and surges are definitely related to the question of ""To mask or not to mask"", lol"
We are going to pay to have a 'Rona antibody test this fall ($125 not covered by insurance) before we decide whether or not we are going to take our vacations this winter. We both had some very minor symptoms back in April and after seeing statistics of how many people are asymptomatic or have very minor symptoms I think it is worth the money. If we have antibodies it would give us peace of mind that we likely have immunity so we would feel much more comfortable leaving the country. I'm still not going anywhere if I'm expected to wear a mask outside.
"""The only way you need to wear a mask if you go to shopping mall centers, they ask you to put mask on. ""Well, they don't just ""ask"" you to put on a mask. They politely inform you that you can't enter without a mask. It's not a choice. And shopping centers aren't the only place masks are required. You can't enter any store or business without one from an Oxxo on the corner to Liverpool in Plaza La Isla to places like Wal-Mart and Chedraui. Also, public buses require masks. Restaurants obviously don't require them when eating but walking through common areas many do. Others suggest it. Depends on the establishment."
"Do people who survive covid-19 become immune to the virus?A study of other human coronaviruses found that people can be reinfected with the same virus although the second time around they didn’t get symptoms and were infectious for a shorter period.So it isn’t safe to assume that you can’t catch or spread the coronavirus if you have already recovered from it, and we may find that vaccines cannot provide permanent protection as a result"
https://theconversation.com/can-you-get-the-…There is no simple answer to this question. You can of course catch the flu twice but usually not soon after then previous infection. Immune responses peak and fall.Here's a pretty good link
"Yes, that is true.Just because you have antibodies in your system doesn't mean that you are immune to the COVID-19. Scientists/doctors are still trying to do more research on this matter, but they have already come out and said this. The antibodies with the current testing that is out there just prove that you had exposure to the COVID-19, not that you are immune. These are 2 different things.."

"Mark M- My wife works in a hospital in the surgery department and she and her co-workers started calling Covid the 'Rona, their nickname for Coronavirus. If one of them sneezes or coughs they all yell 'Rona (obviously as long as they are not around patients) She works in the second biggest hospital in Iowa and they were supposed to be overwhelmed with Covid patients by mid-April. It never happened and she ended up being furloughed for 6 weeks because they didn't have anything to do because they stopped doing elective surgeries and her department didn't have to be re-deployed to work on overwhelmed Covid floors as expected.

"Everyone in Asia is wearing a mask and have been for years. They work great for drywall dust, but not so much for a virus particle. 200K by October? Hmmm seems like on average we would have lost about 1,500,000 people on average. That number isn't scary when you consider the people that are impacted are the frail and weak that would pass if their AC went out. Not trying to down play the value of human life, but death will get us all at some point. The virus spread is inevitable. We just have to suck it up and get past it or we drag it out a few more months."

Taxis and car-hailing services have been banned from taking people out of the city and the number of passengers on buses, trains and subways will also be limited and all are required to wear masks."
"Sungod- I've been saying for weeks that I'd like to see the 'Rona deaths broken down by how many of them were folks who were already in end of life situations. The last couple of months that my Grandma was in the nursing home she was so frail that she would have likely died if she caught a bad cold. Would they really have listed the cause of death as ""common cold"" on the death certificate of a 91 year old woman who couldn't feed herself and had no hope of ever leaving the nursing home? I think not!"

Yeah...you didn’t sound callous and devaluing AT ALL. Among the people that I know who have died include an otherwise healthy 60 year old ER doc, a 53 year old man, a 61 year old man and his 84 year old mother, and a 52 year old man. Not even the 84 year old was frail or weak before being hit with this.

"Lucky, they stated that in Florida that the number of people over 80 that died that were COVID positive was greater than all those under 65 combined. 75% of all deaths have been in nursing homes. I agree that nursing homes are places that we send the elderly for their final days. Sad, but the reality is that most patients there don’t leave. I recently lost my mother. She had a host of medical issues and had she made it another year, corona would have pushed her over the edge, but instead she caught a cold and developed pneumonia in a nursing home. As sad as it is, that is the way life works. Sure I would have loved for her to stick around, but no chance she would have wanted the world to stop so she could have a few more days. Not being selfish, I wouldn’t want to ruin people’s lives for a little more time either."

"Here in Canada we had 2 Mexican migrant workers at a farm in Ontario die of covid at ages 24 and 31. So Covid-19 can strike any ages, not just the elderly. People should be wearing masks in all enclosed areas such as grocery stores, shopping malls, certain work places etc, Anyone who doesn't want to wear a mask on a trip to Mexico during a global pandemic is being selfish and wreckless as far as I am concerned. Of course, I mean at times where there are crowds or you can't self distance."

"Wow sand, we should probably all seek shelter in a bunker and not come out until there’s a vaccine. Say it isn’t so. Two perfectly healthy folk struck down by a virus that is about as likely to cause a fatality as a getting struck by lightning. It isn’t safe out there. I’m wearing a full hazmat suit with a string of garlic around my neck at all times."
"yandoblu, the article you're quoting clearly states that "" nonmedical masks may not be effective in preventing infection for the person wearing them."" But face masks ARE medical masks (please see the next paragraph). ""Unless you are sick, a health care worker, or caring for someone who has COVID-19, medical masks (including surgical face masks and N95s) are not recommended. Because of shortages, medical masks should be prioritized for health care workers providing care for patients.""Now, this article was written in April when the PPE situation in many parts of the country (especially in NYC) was dire. It's not the case anymore. It seems that supply finally meets demand, masks are everywhere and they've gone down in price. So, again, there is no contradiction from what I see. The only reasonable conclusion one can make from the facts that we know is that simple face masks DO PROTECT both the wearer and other people from the wearer. Probably not to the degree N95 masks do, but have we all become perfectionists, all of a sudden?Here are 2 studies on masks (both small, but at least one is peer-reviewed) that have come to the same conclusions: 1. Face masks do protect public from the wearer.2. They also protect the wearer to a certain degree.3. Even a homemade mask is better than nothing.Please wear masks.https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article…https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258…"

"songod says...."".we should probably all seek shelter in a bunker and not come out until there’s a vaccine..I’m wearing a full hazmat suit with a string of garlic around my neck at all times"",,,,,,I THINK MAYBE JUST TRY A FACEMASK .......https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8433317/Coronavirus-infect-nostrils-easily-lungs.htmlEdited: 3:05 am, June 18, 2020 "
"“Maybe just try a face mask.”It’s hard to fathom the ignorance and selfishness of someone who would object to that small inconvenience—only when in public where social distancing was not possible—despite the preponderance of emerging evidence. A small inconvenience not to kill a 30 year old with Type 1 diabetes, a healthy grocery clerk, or someone’s grandma. Truly the definition of a jerk who wants his freeDumb."
"Ignorance is thinking that you are actually doing something when you are doing nothing. If the mask actually did something, I think we would all do it, but it doesn't. If you can blow out a candle without a face mask and you can blow out that same candle without one, you have given yourself a false sense of security and you put that 30 year old at more risk with your ignorance. Even if a mask did something, it won't stop the virus and you are not going to wear masks for the rest of your life. It doesn't go away. I don't understand why people don't realize that. It will linger for years and that poor 30 year old that probably could have reasonably protected themselves for a few months will now have to worry about this for years. Sounds to me like your fears area more selfish than confronting the issue and moving on."
"Let's just stop feeding the Sunntroll. His opinions are inaccurate, irrelevant, and not worth debating.

"Please Beyond, show me one single link that shows that wearing a mask will make this virus go away. Just one. The only two ways it goes away is it either runs its course or there is a vaccine. Considering there is no legitimate flu vaccine or for the common cold, I don't see that happening anytime soon."

"To keep it under control? Ha, so you are now ""mother nature"" and con control a virus spread? That is awesome. I really love the guilting line that you are doing it to protect others and not yourself. That has to be my favorite line. As I have said all along, if it makes you feel better to wear a mask, so be it. Wear it all you want, but don't try to project your fears on me. We won't go back on lockdown because people are starting to realize that you can't hide. You confront this and it is gone. It is pretty simple."

"""show me one single link that shows that wearing a mask will make this virus go away.""Here are 2 studies (one is peer-reviewed) that shows with numbers and data that wearing simple face masks have reduced the risks of infections FOR the wearer, as well as FROM the wearer.

"""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.""The 1918-1920 flu pandemic came in three major waves. After the first wave in the US, the virus subsided, and Americans were restless to have businesses reopened and for social life to resume. There was a growing movement to stop wearing masks, which had become ubiquitous - so much so that The Anti-Mask League of 1919 was formed. These were protests from those who thought the public health ordinance violated their liberty.The virus came back with a vengeance in the fall and was much deadlier than the first wave, eventually killing more than 675,000 Americans and killing around 100 million of the 500 million it infected worldwide before it was over. This was before mass vaccination, before the electron microscope; this is the tragedy of herd immunity and stubborn ignorance.Viruses aren't political; they don't care about your theories or speculations or projections. They're unthinking parasites only wanting to replicate and use your body as a host. Wear a mask.https:/…Edited: 5:33 am, June 21, 2020 "
"Absolutely true, Rick and Sue. Your last paragraph is spot on. Not sure when this common sense practice became so political. Here in Canada, many people wear a mask in stores or any other crowded indoor spaces."
"Sunandsand,I wish that were true here. It seems everything is divisive at this moment in history in my country, even health recommendations to wear face masks."
How many people got sick from coronavirus.Is it health to come to canccun
What is the count on people with coronavirus there..Is mask required.

"You can see the statistics for the state of Quintana Roo on these websites...https:/…nuevo-coronavirus-covid-19https://www.facebook.com/SESAQROO/The stats are broken down by municipalities, and Cancun is in the municipality of Benito Juarez.Wearing a mask is mandatory, and in the municipalities of Benito Juarez and Tulum, people can be fined or detained for not wearing one. I've heard of Mexicans being fined/detained, but that was after being warned and still refusing to wear a mask.Edited: 3:24 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"Some quick number-crunching for the municipality of Benito Juarez...Average number of new cases per day in the month of July: 50.9 (and 9.0 deaths per day)Average number of new cases per day over the past 2 weeks: 33.8 (and 8.2 deaths per day)The numbers are improving, but still not down to the levels back in April & May when we were on lockdown and had more restrictions (Red on the epidemiological risk colour code system)."
"""Average number of new cases per day .... "" numbers are incorrect as no mass testing in Mexico .... only calculated those who did sick med attention, but those at home ... no one calculated them, and there are many"
"Unrequested advice:We get it, you don't want to wear a mask. However, you don't want to be further inconvenienced in your vacation with a fine or even a detention. 0) Self-Isolate 14 days prior to your vacation1) Buy a pack for airports and travel2) Keep masks in a sanitized bag in the freezer. 3)Take one to go in public and wear it on your neck. 4) When entering buildings put it snug in place. 5)Wash your hands often and don't touch your face6) Use sanitizer and take your temperature often. 7) Self-Isolate for 14 days upon your return. This is the very minimum you must be doing as a precaution for yourself and consideration of others. If you're not ready to do this you're not ready to travel.Edited: 5:24 pm, August 20, 2020 "
"re. post 123With 8.2 deaths per day and Covid death rate of 2%, places infections at over 400 per day"

"those numbers reflect only those who did sick help in hospital, those who died home and those who recovered home, no one ever counted them, and there is NO mass testing, only for those who with symptoms went to hospital were tested.

We will be masking. We won't be wearing them when laying down at the pool or beach or restaurants but everywhere else we will be
"In Japan, China mask are accepted long ago (before covid) as help to prevent get sick or spread. In USA its became huge issue, even became political ..."
Please stop bringing politics into the conversation. Good grief!
"It is the law to wear one, maybe you should change your trip to another destination that does not require them. Wearing a mask shows the hotel staff that you care and appreciate them. Maybe practIce wearing one before you go, I wear mine 40+ hours and will have no problem wearing mine for my vacation there in September. I will bet I will get better service from the staff then non mask wearers"
"Been looking at some videos and photos of Moon Grand - most staff (not all) wearing masks, cant see any guests in any of the photos or videos wearing one.Perhaps these are not fully representative, but it would seem odd to me that none of the pictures show any guests wearing masks even in the background of videos/photos.I suppose that most people willing to go on holiday during a pandemic are going to be more likely to be less cautious (the most polite way I can put it). It makes me feel for the staff being put at risk by the selfish behavior and the travelers who do care about doing the right thing."
We will be wearing our masks when we go. I will only take ours off while eating and sitting on the beach in our cabana
"Just go relax wear a mask only when they make you or its required. Get your immune system ready before the trip with vit c, zinc, quercetin, vit d. Use common sense and you will be fine. Alot of people posting are just telling others to wear masks at all times because they are pushing their agenda. Outdoors your safe pretty much and you will be outdoor most of the time. The plane is the biggest risk. Just work on your immune system before you leave"
