Has Victor's Place reopened for Business?
"Haven't heard but I think I recall reading that he'd died? Anyone local? Who was it that said, ""Rumors of my demise are greatly exaggerated?"" My apologies if I'm mistaken."
"No, Fred, you are correct. He passed some months ago."
"I thought so - glad my few remaining memory cells didn't let me down. So, I guess the question is will it ever re-open? Maybe family, employees or another entrepreneur will take over? Time will tell. It won't be the same without Victor - that's for sure. Not sure how many tequila shots I've done with him over the years but pretty sure my liver does - lol."
"We are at the marina (Marriott) now, we love victors place and follow them on Facebook. They were supposed to open last Sunday but didn’t. They posted in the last few days that victor’s wife passed away last week, sad. Victor passed away last spring.Edited: 5:05 pm, August 12, 2020 "
I think his daughter will carry on with the restaurant.
Rumour is that he died of Covid-19 but was registered as pneumonia. Maybe wife caught it too?
In the spring he was listed as having succumbed to cancer
They were supposed to open this past week but now his wife has died. There is a post about it on their Facebook page

"This is such sad news, always our first stop upon arrival. 10 years in a row,...........Victor an amazing man. I hope his daughter can continue on."
I think he had CoVid from what I heard?
You heard wrong. He died from cancer.
