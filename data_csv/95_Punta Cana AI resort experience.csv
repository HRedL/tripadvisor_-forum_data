"I am considering taking the fam (2 oldsters and 3 adult children) to Punta Cana in late October - or November. We are partial to the Riu resorts. I have no idea what to expect in terms of the experience - food service, the pools, bars, etc in the new Covid reality. Can anyone give me some idea of what to expect if we decide to go? Thanks so much!"
"Not sure if anyone here can see over the horizon to October/November... so anyone who tells you TODAY what you should expect THEN has no real idea what they are talking about.Edited: 5:36 pm, August 12, 2020 "
"Patrick, if you want to get a general idea of what is happening currently, it would be good to read the latest reviews from the resorts that you are interested in. That way you can get a feel of how those resorts are handling things in this COVID-19 world. Of course, no one can tell the future, but Oct is really only a few weeks away. Different resorts have different COVID-19 procedures/protocols, so it isn't one size fits all. I just came back from Secrets Cap Cana. I had a great time, but things are different. I say keep expectations reasonable when traveling in these COVID-19 times. I don't think there will be any drastic changes in regards to COVID-19 restrictions/protocols from now until Oct unless there are setbacks. I definitely don't see an ease/let-up of restrictions/protocols at the resorts within these few weeks with everything going on with COVID-19 now."
"Patrick, I just returned from a week of vacation (8/3 -8/10) in Punta Cana. We stayed at Dreams Macao Beach resort (approx. 17 miles from the airport).Dreams Macao should be on your short list with regard to choosing THE RIGHT PLACE in light of Covid19 concerns/reality as this resort really impressed us with its full and complete practices and policies in this regard:1. There is a body temperature sensor at the entrance of Main Lobby to alert anyone of ""abnormal"" readings.2. EVERY employee is required to wear a mask AT ALL TIMES and is ""tested every week""3. Detailed cleaning of tables and chairs before,and after each seating at every restaurant4. Ubiquitous Hand sanitizer dispensers and copious presence of sealed sanitizer wipe packs EVERYWHEREAfter wearing our masks at all times the first day at this resort, we stopped wearing our masks for the rest of the time we were here (we all tested negative for Coronavirus upon our return)I can give you more details if you have any questions about round trip flights (we used UNITED), transfers, excursions, dining options, etc. at this resort if you respond. I plan on doing a detailed review on Dreams Macao as soon as I have achance but the previous poster had a logical suggestion of reading reviews of those resorts that might interest you.Good luck, don't worry and be happy (that you are even able to consider going to a paradise like Punta Cana)Mr. Lee"
"Hi Lee, did you have the test with you? Did you notice if they were testing everyone or random people without the test. Thanks"
"Hi Winnie, no, we did not have any testing results (3 in our party) as the requirement for providing a negative Covid testing documentation upon arrival to punta Cana was announced mere three days before our departure.Upon entering the airport, one is asked if you have a good testing documentation. Depending on your response, (2) two lines were formed. Those with GOOD - ""negative"" documentation (found out from other vacationers that documentation ranged from official results with seals all the way down to a simple one sentence test result signed by nobody) were promptly given access to baggage claim and then Immigration..We were directed to a separate line where a professional, polite and friendly ""nurse""? took a blood sample by pricking our fingers and then our passports were handed to another person who indicated that testing results would be available in ""five to ten minutes"". After about 15 minutes, a young lady who had all of our passports returned the same to us and wished us a good vacation. :)Mind you, our experience took place on August 3rd. If you have the luxury of having a good documentation (that shows you are Covid-19 free within 5 days prior to your arrival), you actually can save yourself 15 minutes or more by having the same.At the end of the day, it would appear EVERY ONE is evaluated since you will either in good faith, submit a valid and accurate test and be exempt from testing or BE TESTED by Dominican Republic officials, PAID BY DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.Let me know if I covered everything you wanted know. I am very supportive of how they are handling everything there in this regard.Lee"
"Winnie, my brothers had the same testing results as Mr. Lee on July 31st. It was a very quick and easy process for them. They tested negative and they were on their way to the resort.I met someone at Secrets Cap Cana in which they showed proof of their negative test results on their phone. It was in an email. I wouldn't even say it's about saving time IMO. It's really about easing the anxiety of just knowing you are good (or not so to speak) before you step on the plane. If you test positive at PUJ, you have go into quarantine. Of course, no one wants to deal with that for a vacation. My brothers and I rolled the dice as we are very diligent in following COVID-19 safety protocols at home. This was announced by the DR govt the night of July 28th and our flights were on July 30th. We didn't have time to get tested. I even mostly quarantined in my apt before my trip. It really is just peace of mind to have your test results beforehand so you can control what needs to happen next."
Mr Lee: how busy was Dreams? Were most amenities open or on a rotation basis I suspect. Dreams Macao is one of the resort I am looking at for a fall trip.
"SlyGuy,By governmental mandate, Dreams was about 20% full, I understand the cap set by the federal gov. is 30% max for any resort in Punta Cana. Having said that, on or around 7th or 8th, whole bunch of people checked in giving me the impression Dreams Resort was quickly approaching the 30% mark if not exceeding it and loving it (the resort management that is).Surprisingly, other than one restaurant (CoCo Cafe) which was never open during my 8 day stay, most of other facilities were open and available to all guests. The rotational access applied to mostly evening dining as if one was open one night, it was likely unavailable the next night. I chose to be in Preferred membership and found any and all amenities associated with Preferred membership was available (i.e. the lounge, VIP pool, VIP beach cabanas, 25% off spa massages, services, room service, free long distance and international calls, etc. etc.)The resort, as you know, is brand new and very close to running like a well oiled machine. Were there hiccups? Yes, but I expected them and they were no more than annoying but doable.I think you are very smart in keeping this one on your list.."
"Hi Cat! For obvious reasons, I fully agree with your opinion that having a good Covid-19 test results prior to arriving is a great thing besides ""saving time"""
"Thanks for that. I've been to Macao beach a few times and love the area. And although Dreams is a family resort, with lower occupancy (and great pricing right now) it is a good opportunity to visit a brand new resort as other favourite resorts will not be open for dates I'm looking to travel."
Thanks Lee! Very helpful!
"Thanks Cat, yes I agree about the stress factor, our problem is testing is taking a lot longer than 5 days and is just starting to become available to everyone, hoping by Nov it will be easier to get."
"No problem, WinnieTry to look into getting a rapid PCR COVID-19 test. These are hard to find currently, but completely worth the hassle of doing so. Officially, the DR government is requiring a negative PCR test result or you will be given the rapid antigen blood COVID-19 test at the airport. I located a rapid PCR site at a medical center in my area so I can come out of quarantine sooner. The nasal swabs took a few seconds and I had my results within 20 min. I just had this done yesterday. Good luck!"
"The only problem with the Rapid tests are that now their efficacy and results are being questioned because of the “machines” (Vivalytic analysis device) used to give results. Unless the results give a better +/- on accurate results, It’s just a matter of time before their results won’t be good enough to satisfy the “powers that be”. There’s also a saliva test that’s gaining momentum and gets quicker results than the lab sent swab test but like all of these tests, their results are questioned. I work with a lot of these companies, err on the side of caution and give yourself time to get a swab test that’s sent to a lab. I wouldn’t rely on the Rapid test too much unless the accuracy rates go up. The Ohio Gov did a rapid test and got a positive, then negative test the same day on the same Vivalytic systemI guess, bottom line, who knows anymore!!,"
"So Cat, when you returned to the USA you should quarantine for 14 days, if you get a test when you return and it negative you can resume life as normal? Are you allowed to leave your home for test? This is appealing."
There is a rapid antigen test and a rapid PCR test - these are 2 different things. My rapid PCR test was done in a medical center by a lab technician.
"Senor CervezaI'm not under any mandatory quarantine orders, but I did so as I wanted to be a safer and responsible traveler. I quarantined for about 5 days and then I had my rapid PCR test done yesterday. I'm going out but I'm still practicing my COVID-19 safety/health protocols as the virus is still around (mask-wearing, face shield wearing, social distancing, etc)Also, I want to add that a PCR test is more accurate than an antigen test (with what is currently available)"
"Cat.. it doesn’t matter who performed the tests, it’s the reliability of the tests themselves! Fauci can perform the test but he’s only as good as the machines running the results.. that’s what I’m saying! Like the masks, I hope they get a few tests that have at least a 98% +/- accuracy result. Right now, none of the tests are close to that!Unfortunately that’s why countries are struggling with the protocols and it’s changing every day! It’s definitely frustrating"
"Wahova, That's my point. Currently, the PCR test is more accurate than the antigen tests.Doesn't make sense to get frustrated as there is nothing you can do but just listen and follow protocols from the experts. Are these tests perfect? No, but we are working with what we have...I don't know. Call me an optimist instead of a glass ""half-empty"" kind of person, lol. The COVID-19 situation is fluid and constantly changing. The scientists and docs are all learning about this all in real-time. I take that back...I can't tell you how you should be feeling. As for me, I just choose to keep updated in the news by the doctors and scientists, follow my COVID-19 health/safety protocols, and just live my life as best as I can with the current info provided. I'm already planning my next trip to Punta Cana for the winter. I'm going to live my life, but be smart, safer, and responsible about it when regarding the virus. Everyone just needs to do what is best for them and whatever they are comfortable with. That's really it.Edited: 4:14 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"Cat.. I don’t doubt you are taking the proper precautions.. as am I, it’s the other people that I worry about... We’re still planning on PC over New Years.. here’s hoping things keep getting better..not worse! Would suck for everyone but as long as we’re doing our part, it’s basically out of our control..."
"Agree with both of you! All we can ever do is follow our own conscience! Of course, and that which is mandated by the random rules of our local governments. OOPS...who typed ""random""?Re quarantine upon re-entry to the US, as far as I know, and the news is on literally all day in this house, we have no national mandated quarantine. Some states are barring visitation with self quarantine if you travel to one on the list."
"Yes, PrizeYou are correct. There is no national mandated quarantine for Americans currently. This hasn't changed. There is the recommended/suggested 14-day self-quarantine by the CDC."
"Not that I am not going to self quarantine, but the CDC also has a Level 3 travel advisory. The US State Department has a Level 4.: )We all travel and return relying on whether our fellow travellers follow their conscience. As for us, masks in public areas like lobby, restaurants and bars. I draw the line at the pool and beach, which is why we get a swim out. : ) No judgment on those who aren't like me."
"#17 Good to know, and great that you took extra precautions! Us Canadians are still at 14 days upon return, I guess its a good thing, we are doing really well overall in terms of cases and deaths, this could be part of it.j."
"In general I would say that Canada is better than the US in covid response that said there are metrics where the US looks better than Canada also. For example over 7.4% of cases in Canada have resulted in death in the US its only 3.1% the flip side is the US has 2.1 X more cases per capita than Canada has so it depends on the metric but overall I would say Canada has had a better outcome.Edited: 5:37 pm, August 17, 2020 "
Actually the US has 5.05 more cases per capita than Canada just to correct above. I was thinking of deaths per capita and the US has 2.1 X more death per capita than Canada.
"The USA also has about 500 times as many active cases, which reflects the current status. And the DR has something like 80 times the active cases of Canada.Mark"
"Hi Mr.Lee. I plan on going to Punta Cana in 2 weeks. When you arrived at the airport on 8/3/20, did you have to undergo a Covid test?"
"Sorry, please disregard my last question since I noticed you did answer the question about Covid testing. Thx."
No worries IP. Hope you have a fantastic time!
Thank you Wildcat! Love your response and explanation of the Covid Facts.CJ
