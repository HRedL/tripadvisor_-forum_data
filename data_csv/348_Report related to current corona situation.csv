"It is not the time to travel, world is in a crisis and tourism is kind of irrelevant right now. But since I am a tourist in the middle of this thing, I’m sharing my experience with travelling at this time. Albania is taking very strict measures - which is good I think, look at other European countries...Arrived at the airport from Amsterdam today. All was fine. They took our temperature before passports. Rented a car. No public trans anyway, but we did see taxis. I’m in Berat now. No traffic to, from or within the bigger cities. We kind of avoided them but were stopped by police like 3 times, mostly around Tirana/Durres. We showed our boarding pass and this was fine. Lots of people with masks, definitely a lot more than in my country. Even in the car people wear them. Berat is quiet now, I’m sure this is also because of corona. Most restaurants are closed, bars are open. Also hotels that normally serve dinner, do not always serve dinner. This restaurant situation may last a while, but the curfew with traffic may be over on Monday. In Berat people drive and some people are found on the streets. Definitely more than in Tirana/Durres area. Driving from Berat to the coast on Sunday may be problematic as the route would go through Vlora - which is one of the cities with no traffic. None of the above is a concern, compared to flying back in 10 days when the international situation will be worse."
Thanks for your report. Good to know you have got to berat. Booked for April but seems unlikely now.
"Yes it is best to cancel probably, if you can and if they let you then better to do so. As of today ALL restaurants everywhere are closing until April 3rd. There do seem to be hotel restaurants that still cook. We found one here and are staying in one in Gjirokastra on Sunday til Tuesday. After that, we’re just gonna be looking for hotels that serve food beforehand. We are contemplating going home earlier, but flights are expensive and staying seems to be OKish right now."
"Nevermind, there is no point in staying. Went to the police station today to inform if it would be OK to drive to Gjirokaster. It is not. So we changed our flight and now go home on Monday. We needed a written permission to drive to the airport as well, and we got it. This is not the trip that we had in mind, but there are worse things and in my opinion the government is doing the absolute right thing (except they should also ban all incoming flights for a while imo!). Berat is absolutely beautiful and glad we have seen it. We’ll come back to Albania for sure."
"There are no bars , restaurants, gatherings ( and of course no cinemas , night clubs ) etc open until a 2nd order of the government.Schools are closed till 3rd of April.No public transport and no private cars allowed to be used in any city.All land border crossings will be closed tomorrow, 3 of them already got closed yesterday.All flights will Italy got closed 5 days ago.Probably all incomming flights will be closed soon.It is good that you decided to leave on Monday because this is the worst situation for a tourist."
"Safe home on Monday and thanks so much for your report. Albania doesn't have the resources to deal with increased demand on critical care so they are right to introduce measures to protect their people.I hope that we can all get through this. I will be doing all I can to make sure I can visit Albania berat, girokasterand Albanian alps will need to wait for now."
"It is not just a matter of resources.You can see Italy, which has one of the best health care systems in the world and now is collapsing.On the same road is France and Spain."
"We went home today, and on the plane were several people who also arrived last Friday and rigorously shortened their vacation. From today, no one is allowed to be outside their house after 6PM. No one is allowed to sit in public places or in parks. Total lockdown, severe measures, whole country. Also all flight to and from UK are cancelled after today 23:59. It’s a matter of days before all flights shut down I think. I’m just glad we’re back home. We did have a pretty good weekend and have some really good memories of Berat and our amazing guesthouse Hani i Xheblatit."
"My husband and I (from the US) are currently scheduled for a 2 week trip to Albania in early July. I think this trip will probably not happen due to the global pandemic. Husband is still holding out hope. I'm interested in the thoughts of the local Albanian experts. Based on what you all are seeing happen in the area, what are your thoughts?"
"Well,from monday hotels and many other businesses will be allowed to open.However, after 5:30 pm everything will be closed till 5am next day. Also weekends everything will be closed. The situation of coronavirus for the moment seems to be under control and the government is planning a gradual opening of the country, but borders will be closed till end of April. There is talk about opening borders with neighbouring countries in May as the region seems to have the pandemy under control as well. There is a chance things will be back to ""normal"" end of May, early June but it all depends on the numbers of infections not only here in Albania but in surrounding countries as well."
"Not exactly local expert, experts today tell much and completely different things - you can choose one according to your faith, but situation in all former socialist countries is the same - virus don't take us so much as in West. Difference between death cases - 60 times to one.Wise people say that it's because our obligatory vaccine against tuberculosis. Because social distancing and other precautions in every country is almost the same.Thanks to ( in some things ) wise leadership of past revolutionary rulers of working class.:) I even think that we need to create new pact of Warsaw or Eastern European Union from Ionic & Adriatic to Baltic Seas and live in peace and corona safety. :)Generally I'm optimistic about traveling between our countries even in this summer. Situation in USA and other highly virus influenced Western countries is completely different. Today I don't think that citizens of those countries will be allowed to freely move for their vacations there. But who knows - situation hopefully can change in a moment - as Spanish flu disappeared in a week.Edited: 12:24 pm, April 18, 2020 "
I greatly appreciate everyone's thoughts

"Is there an update from Albania that someone can give. I keep trying to find information on my own but most of the information from primary sources comes from Albania government websites and it is not translatable into English for me. What's the present situation with regard to legal travel for summer 2020. Is there a quarantine in place for those entering Albania and if so, how long is it? Any other pertinent information that may be of use?I sincerely appreciate any information that anyone can offer."
"Well, it is safe to say that the pandemic definitely is under control here. Albania has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world from Covid19. The number of people that have recovered from Covid19 is much higher than those still ill. There are zero intubated patients in the hospitals at this moment and the number of new daily infections is low, in single numbers. So, the government is gradually opening the country, depending on the weekly numbers of the sick people.Majority of the businesses are open and more will open from next Monday. If the numbers will keep being low then from 11 th of May all bars and restaurants will open too.There are plans to open borders and allow tourists coming in without restrictions from the end of May or early June."
"I truly appreciate your response here. And it is encouraging to hear that opening the border for tourists with restriction may be coming as soon as early June. We have an early July trip planned. We are prepared to postpone it to summer 2021 if needs be but if things are safe, then we would love to come.If anyone has any suggestions for good online resources for information that can be translated to English, I'd love to hear those too.Thank you again, helloween2016!"
You are wellcome.https://www.gazetatema.net/enghttp://en.ata.gov.al/These are a couple of daily Albanian newspapers that got an english version as well. There are a few more but i don't have the time right now to check for them.

"I have reservations made last year,forJune 12-24, road trip: Romania-Sarajevo-Neum-Budva-Velipoje-Prizren-Peja Romania.Should I cancel the bookings?"
As far as I know Croatia will lift the lock with the Bosnian border on July 1st. So take it into account if you want to go from Bosnia to Montenegro through Croatia

"I'm sorry, Albert, if I didn't understand:You posted on May 12, but are you referring to the opening of the borders until the end of April?Did you copy-paste an older piece of information?Any other new information?Thanks, Adrian, Arad, RomaniaEdited: 4:33 am, May 13, 2020 "
"Hi Adrian, the situation is fluid and changing every week. It seems the Balkan region has passed the peak of the pandemic with relatively low numbers of infected people. Today i heard Serbia will open its borders to neighbouring countries on 1 June. Albania is planning to open its borders end of May early June with its neighbours too, but so far no official statement has been made. There has been some easing of restrictions on travel to Italy and Greece but only for the residents of those countries and Albanian citizens. The good news is the government has issued a protocol of guidelines to be followed by all the hotels, restaurants and tourist agencies for the summer season and at the end of May all beaches will be open.It is higly likely you will be able to make your trip."
"Latest news suggests ppl can be on the streets until 9PM. Different rules for red areas (areas with Covid cases) such as Kruja and Tirana. Also cases increased in the last couple of days so wouldn’t be surprised if some measures return. “ Under the new rules in Albania, people can now spend more time outside. Prime Minister Edi Rama 'ignored' protests on National Theater's demolition and announced on Sunday evening new 'coronavirus rules' saying that people can now stay outside until 09:00 pm not 05:30.Bars and restaurants can reopen starting from Monday and people can move freely without police permits even with their personal vehicles.However, government guidance on maintaining social distance and allows TV studios to invite people in a panel with the condition to respect a 2m distance.""Authorizations for the movement of pedestrians or vehicles are being lifted but the entrance or moving out a 'red area' is still prohibited,"" said Rama.The 14-day measure for self-quarantine does not change and its violation is punishable by law and the Criminal Code.Starting from Monday, Fieri is considered a 'green area' as people can move without restrictions.“"
"I would fly to Tirana on July 14 and travel around the country for 16 days, have rented a car. So I hope the situation gets even better than it is now and that Albania lets me come in and not send back because I come from Sweden where our situation is a little different than anywhere else.I wonder where and if I can find information about it. Does anyone know something about? Thanks."
"At the moment only repatriation flights are allowed to land at the airport. Charter flights are expected to start from 2 nd of June, no word yet when commercial flights will resume.The pandemic so far is under control, one of two Covid hospitals has closed down due to the low number of patients. Only 15 people remain in hospital recovering from Covid 19 and there have not been any fatalities for the last 20 days. Life in green zones (where i live) is back to normal much sooner than i expected. Bars, coffee shops, parks and pedestrian streets are packed with people.I am worried of a second wave of infection as very few people are wearing masks. In fact, coronavirus is not a topic anymore here.Edited: 9:17 am, May 20, 2020 "
"Thanks, I will wait and hope ☺. I am flying with Austrian airlines so hopefully they not cancel my flight,It is nice that corona is not ghosting in Albania much and begin to be almost zero. And not will be the second wave."
"Khamlia if you'll scroll back in the conversation, there are a couple posts with links to some Albanian news sources (in English) where you can check the status of things. Hope this helps."
"@MooreUSA, thanks I saw it, that end of this May they will say more about reopen border, so I hope it will go good for us from Sweden to entry Albania then ☺"
"Are borders opened? Is it possible to drive Skhodre - Lezhe - Fier - Gjirokaster - Saranda?Edited: 2:37 am, May 24, 2020 "
"@ Homer, nothing official yet but borders with Montenegro,Kosova,North Macedonia will be open from 1 of June according to some sources. The border with Greece will be open on 15 June."
@ helloween2016Thanks. Notify us please when it is official.
So borders are open now. Does anyone know if they are open to all nationalities? We are trying to enter from Montenegro on 14th of June and onto Greece when borders open on 15th of June.
I would check if you can get to Montenegro at all. Are you in the UK now? On the most recent map from our govt all non Schengen countries were still orange and Montenegro showed as red while most of Europe shows yellow.
@NotascousDo you like quarantine when in Greece?
"@ Notascous.Sorry, MNE borders are NOT open for UK citizens. Complete list here https://www.ijzcg.me/me/novosti/covid-19-pop…"
"@ Notascous.Sorry, MNE borders are NOT open for UK citizens. Complete list countries allowed here: https://www.ijzcg.me/me/novosti/covid-19-pop…"
"Thanks for the reply, I have seen that list but Google translate seems to indicate restriction is not based on citizenship but country of departure. I am departing from Germany. Do you know what the official guidance is?@floriani22 I am not going on holiday, I have family matters must attend. I will of course quarantine for 14 days on arrival to Greece."
Anyone know when albania opens air borders/ flights for people in UK?
"Flights between Italy and Albania were postponed to July 1st. Weere to begin on June 15th. So it's a non stable situation. What about 14 day quarantine when you get back to UK?Edited: 6:16 am, June 14, 2020 "
Currently corona cases are spiking at its highest point (57 today which is the highest number of new cases since the beginning of the crisis). This seems to be an effect of ending the lockdown. I would be very careful with making any plans in the next couple of weeks. Of course you can take the risk though.
"Coronavirus spiking is the effect of carelessness behavior of people and no control of social distancing from the government. Very bad management. Same situation in Northern MacedoniaEdited: 7:56 am, June 14, 2020 "
"@ Notascous I arrived in Albania via Montenegro, few hours ago. But you can not enter Montenegro with UK passport only, unless you have in it German's permission to stay. Then you are treated as German (free to enter), otherwise, treated as UK, meaning banned."
New covid-19 cases are doubling every 3 days. Exponential growth. The situation is not looking good
Montenegro closes the border with Albania
"Covid-19 cases themselves are pieces of sh*t. Are there dying people all around, thousands and thousands? Hospitals full of dying people with pneumonia every hour? No?Edited: 2:12 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Hey, superman. Congrats for your shape."
