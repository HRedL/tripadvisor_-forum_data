"I booked a Japan Airlines ticket via Travelgenio.com for a flight from Singapore to Los Angeles via Tokyo on 4-5 April 2020. I have two complains against Travelgenio. First, the price of my booking was S$ 978.62, but they charged S$ 1006.02 to my card. I provided them the evidence of extra charge upon a response to my request to refund, but they have not responded since then. Second, I got an email from Travelgenio on 01-Apr-2020 that the schedule of the connecting flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles is shifted to 7th April 2020. That means I would have to stay two days in Tokyo before flying for Los Angeles. In the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic, staying Tokyo for two days involves health risk as well as challenges due to travel restriction and citywide lockdowns. Therefore, I tried to contact Travelgenio right-away, but they did not respond. Then, I called the Japan Airlines customer service, explained my concern about the change, and was advised to contact Travelgenio if I want to cancel or reschedule the flight. Since then, I have been consistently trying to reach Travelgenio, but unfortunately, they never responded. I got autoreplies a few times that suggested to contact one way or other, but eventually it did not come up with any real response. I also contacted with Japan Airlines that they do have responsibility as the flight schedule was changed by them. However, they just asked to contact the travel agent. Now, I am in a helpless situation on top of the stress and worry due to COVID-19."
"Have you skimmed the other 80 threads about TravelGenio, Kamal? Your story is repeated over and over and there are replies from TravelGenio in nearly every thread.You booked with a bad company. You're not the only one, but you will have to work through them. Hopefully you have learned not to use third parties in the future."
"Thanks for your comment. I have been sending email everyday for more than a week but Travelgenio never reply. Here, they only give a link to their website, but does not reply to the actual question. I hope you understand how stressful it is in such a situation. Also, I do not think using third party is an issue, only just I choose a bad one."
"Most of them are bad. Not sure why you needed a new thread. Most folks post in the existing ones and TG replies there. Come the end of this crisis, one or two threads with 6000-7000 posts might be more effective in warning away future travelers than 90 threads with 30 posts in them"
"The other post is for Japan Airlines as they have denied to take any responsibility while the flight was changed by themselves. Anyway, Travelgenio is doing the same to many other people. There is a facebook group with more than 1,000 'Travelgenio Victims'!! Here's the link: https:/…"
"Yes, and there are 6000 posts here in 90 other threads about them. Not just one about Japan air. Limiting the number of threads so you have a few with thousands of posts shows much more of a DANGER WARNING to future travelers than a bunch of threads with 10 or 20 posts that someone in the future who googles the company will find.Wouldn't you be more wary of a 5000 post thread that comes up in a google search than this 10 post thread?"
"Ok, I got it now. Will check if I can add to another thread."
"Hi Kamal. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking and your doubts so we can review your case and give you an answer? Thank you, regards. Information regarding Covid-19:…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…"
"Kamal you need to remember that JAL will only work with Travelgenio and not you because technically they are the customer, not you. You contracted with TG to work on your behalf with JAL."
"Hi Travelgenio,I sent you several emails and filled up the online forms in your website, but haven't got any reply. Anyway, I have just sent another email now.Thanks,Kamal"
"@mauidave65, I understand their policy on third-party purchase, but they do have a responsibility to provide me with an alternative when they changed the flight schedule."
"Kamal, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
"Travelgenio, I will appreciate if you please can speed up the process. My flight date passed already. I am really shocked to see that I was not even asked if I am comfortable to travel with the changed dates and circumstances! And now, I am still struggling to get a reply from you guys for a refund or reschedule."
We are doing our best to reply all the many queries received. Thanks
"Ok, I will wait for your reply."
"'First, the price of my booking was S$ 978.62, but they charged S$ 1006.02 to my card.' Travelgenio charged their fee to press a few buttons to make the booking.'I am really shocked to see that I was not even asked if I am comfortable to travel with the changed dates and circumstances!' Since you asked TG to act as your agent they were JAL's customer and as such changes were sent to them. That TG didn't pass on the information to you is their usual way of doing business, but even with that it's always recommended to keep an eye on a booking at the carrier's website.The airlines can change schedules as they see fit, which is what JL did. The changes are made by computer, and at other times the passenger has the option to accept or reject the changes and work with the carrier to find a better routing - but booking with a third party means you'd have to work with them to make changes, which obviously did not happen.If the flight operated and you didn't take it then there may be no refund available as you would have been considered a no show. If you had a return flight to SIN that may have been cancelled if you didn't take the outbound - check that status at the JL website. What JL will do in this unusual situation is up to them and they may be willing to give a voucher for the value of the flight, but that may need to be processed by TG."
"TRAVELGENIO IS SCAM COMPANY. They deliberately dint respond to my plea to reschedule my flight and left me stranded 8000km away from home! They even shut down their page just to sabotage communicationNow they even want to charge me for more money are refus to refund me, even thou the airlines allows for refundsAVOID TRAVELGENIO AT ALL COSTSDESPICABLE BEYOND WORDS"
"Petar: Don't pat yourself on the back too much thinking this company DELIBERATELY DID THIS TO YOU. They don't know or care who you are and they certainly didn't do any of this to you.There is a global pandemic, dint you hear? And the airlines all got shut down and the phone lines all got full and the customer service departments at companies that provide STRONG customer service were overwhelmed. You chose a low cost company like TravelGenio, probably to save a few dollars or euros or whatever. You can't expect these companies to have customer service departments strong enough to handle an unprecedented situation like this, do you?Unfortunately you agreed to their Terms and Conditions when you signed up with this company, dint you? and that means fees and vouchers and slow refunds, if any.Tens of thousands of people found themselves stranded thousands of km from home, and many of them also had to pay a whole lot of money to get home.I bet when you googled Travelgenio today you noticed thousands of posts here warning you away from this company. Too bad you dint google them before you jumped on their cheap fare and figured out then that this was a company to avoid.Next time you will research first, right?"
"Hi Petar, thanks for your feedback. We would like to review your case in detail. For this, please could you contact us at customer.service@travelgenio.com, telling us what happened. Many thanks INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…"
Am I the only person to suspect that all the one-post wonders claiming that Travelgenio are a ‘scam’ are probably the same people that stockpiled all the toilet paper?
"Ha ha, that wouldn't surprise me at all, Greg. I reckon that a sizeable proportion of those who never research a company, don't read the T&C's they agree to, and then complain later are also convinced that 5G masts are spreading the virus.I hope that people will learn to change their ways, but I doubt it will happen."
"Hi Travelgenio, I haven't been contacted yet."
"Hi Kamal. One of our agents will contact you shortly. Thank you, regards."
"Hi Travelgenio, no one has contacted with me yet. Will that really happen any time soon?"
Thank you for comment Kamal. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days. Best regards.
"Hi Travelgenio, my flight date was on 4-Apr-2020. So, it is already a bit late. Could you please speed up the process?"
"I am sure they are beyond overwhelmed in their ability to handle things right now and it will probably take them weeks to get back to you, and your refund will probably take months. When you book with these websites, the airline has no obligation and in many ways no ability to fix the multitude of problems that come from booking 3rd party. In the future, don't use these sites."
"Thank you, evanh1982. I understand that. However, I need to find a solution for this now. The airlines said they can process a refund or reschedule, but this has to be done through Travelgenio."
"You are not going to get any solution now. Travelgenio is based in Spain, and that country is in total lockdown. It would be unrealistic to expect anything much to happen until the lockdown is lifted."
"You may well need a solution now, Kamal, but there's nothing you can do to achieve one, sorry. You are completely in the hands of Travelgenio, who won't refund until they have the money from the airline and also the resources to pass it on to you.Even before the pandemic, it wasn't exactly unusual for third parties to take months to refund their customers. It's not realistic to expect fast responses at present."
"I'd say go the chargeback route via your card, you've tried all you could. They should be more understanding."
"They are understanding, Nabeel. They just don’t have the manpower or cash to process everything NOW"
"I begin to wonder how much the card providers will be able to help, they don’t have infinite resources to deal with many thousands of customers either. It’s going to take months before claims and refunds can be sorted out."
"My travel agent refused to refund or provide even travel vouchers. They only demanded a rebooking within two months time (despite the airline allowing full refund for any fare type). I filed for a chargeback and got it credited to my account a few hours ago, I'm done with travel agents and happy that American Express sided my way.I would've seriously taken travel vouchers for Emirates as I would I would most definitely use them in the future, but to only provide a rebooking option within a very narrow window with the current pandemic is just a huge no-no.Edited: 12:49 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"i have been scamed by them too! I ordered a flight to Japan with them, plus i added a incurence for illness. sadly my partner mother is not feeling good and we cannot fly anytime soon. i cant reach them- they wont answer and the website is not helpful. they are the WORST!"
"Read post 18, Yael.You picked a bad company to work with. Dozens of threads here warning you away."
"Hi Kamal, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"
Yael S you can get in touch with us following the contact section of our site. Also you can check this site …travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"OP your not going to get a resolution to this now it just is not going to happen, sorry but just in the future research your travel agency before choosing them.#30 chargebacks are more for fraudulent transactions, mistaken transactions, computer error double transactions that kind of thing. The bank will have to investigate the charge before agreeing to the charge back, the airline will confirm that the OP did in fact buy the ticket and explain that it was bought though a travel agent and aid agent needs to execute the refund request. The bank will get in touch with travegenio, which will confirm that the OP again bought the ticket and agreed to the TOS which do in fact explain that all refund requests will have to be initiated by the travel agent. This would not give the bank a lot of wiggle room to release the charge back to the OP. If this were one of the more famous travelgenio cases where someone got booked on a different ticket then they purchased or booked on a route that no longer exists a charge back would be the way to go."
"#38 I received a chargeback through American Express, no problem.All I cited was that I paid for a flight that was due to fly but was cancelled, the travel agent is refusing to issue refunds or travel vouchers, they insist on rebooking only. I pointed out how unfair it is to purchase a service that isn't delivered and then be flat out refused a refund regardless of time frame. They issued it without asking a question.Imagine if you order a new washing machine which has been sold out/discontinued suddenly, you'd expect your money back, not some half-assed promise of an IOU. I can understand if they reply with that refunds will take extra processing time due to the ongoing situation and that's entirely acceptable. Flat out refusing a refund? No thanks, I'm going for a chargeback, that's day-light robbery. There's no harm in trying if you have exhausted all other avenues, people shouldn't be losing their money.Edited: 3:13 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"No I get that, and your right amex did and should have issued the chargeback. However...I just strongly advise people (as someone who has worked in the call center, customer service end of this stuff) that you should not always expect a chargeback to work in these situations, but really I guess there is nothing wrong with trying."
"Nabeel, we will process the refunds as soon as airline approves and manages them. Thanks"
"HiI have requested to change my flight and send a message [Ticket #3815147] Change flightsI have lost trust on your customer service and contacted the Airline directly and they are happy to proceed my request without any charges before 30th June, but under the circumstances that you withdraw the “refund request”. I have received no refund and no confirmation (reply) from you since March.Could you help response ASAP to avoid surcharge by the airline?ThanksLan"
“ I have lost trust on your customer service and contacted the Airline directly“Wait. You had trust in their customer service to begin with? Whatever for? They are some of the shonkiest of the shonky and their terrible customer service has been documented for years. You don’t go to a cheap third party middleman because you want good customer service- you go because you want cheap. You are not the customer of the airline. You are the customer of TG. If you wanted the airline’s help you should have booked directly through them.
"Hi Lan D, Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"HelloI have a similar story hereI reserve 2 tickets on turkish airline and the price on travelgenio was 194usd,of course on their website currency was either euro or gpb, and i couldn't convert it to usd on their website, but it was equal to 194usd,2hours after receiving e-tickets, travelgenio CHARGED me again for 27 gpb and 30 euro for i dont know why! I tried email them and send online complain on their website as they sent link of complain for me, but no answer and no refund! Is this is a scam company??"
Maryam: Please read the thread before you post. You decided to use a totally incompetent web site. Do not expect any response fo many months.
"""travelgenio CHARGED me again for 27 gpb and 30 euro for i dont know why!""---I take it you've not read their FAQs? Point 3 seems to cover any potential additional charges.https://uk.travelgenio.com/pages/payment-faqs"
"Yes unfortunatelyMy question is about how come they cut off ticket price then 2 hours later they take additional charge! If it was for the same ticket, it should ve been taken at the same time, and why wudnt it ask for mastercard security code or something before charging me a second time! Isnt this like stealing or something!"
"Because they are a horrible company that we have over 20,000 complaints here about and that you didn't read the Terms and Conditions that allow them to add those fees.You really have to:A) Read Terms & conditionsandB) Find threads like this before you give any company any money. There are over 200 separate threads here warning you away from TraveGenio. There are TONS of incompetent companies out there who exist merely to separate the unwary from their money.If they did take money they are not authorized to by the terms and conditions you should immediately dispute the charges with your credit card company. You will find that although they have no customer service people to help you, they most assuredly have a team of people ready to fight off any credit card disputes by pointing out that you agreed to the feesEdited: 9:21 am, August 21, 2020 "
"How can i read it when it say access denied due to security service they use!! I tried multiple browsers, but same issue came up, access to FAQ page is denied!"
"If I couldn't access a company's information, especially something like the FAQ's and T&C's before purchasing, that would be a huge red flag for me to start running the other way!"
"""ow can i read it when it say access denied due to security service they use!! I tried multiple browsers, but same issue came up, access to FAQ page is denied!""---Might have been pertinent for you to have mentioned that. Although it it was me, and I couldn't see a companies T&C's I'd be reluctant to carry on with a purchase."
"Yes that's right, except it is there on every price comparing app avaliable out there! I pray flight don't cancel because airline cancelation refund from travelgenio would be nearly impossible"
"Maryam A, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
I did already
"You are right to be concerned, if the flight gets canceled or moved to a time that doesn't work for you, you will be in a VERY long line of concerned customers.As the others have said, if you can't read a company's Terms & Conditions, RUN AWAY. And if you did 5 minutes of research prior to choosing TG you would have found all the threads here and you would likely have stayed awayCaveat Emptor rules the business world. Buyer Beware!"
Maryam please can you tell us if TG ever get back to you as a result of you doing what they asked.
"No, no reply at all"
