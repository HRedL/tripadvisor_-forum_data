Like many ppl our flights with Air Canada were cancelled for our trip planned to Greece in June. We were offered the 24 month credit for our flight amount... alternatively we could get a partial refund of about 70% of our ticket price (and lose over $800). Any advice from others in a similar boat? What did you decide?
If the airline cancelled the flights surely you are entitled to a 100% refund - why only 70%
"Air Canada is not offering a full refund for anyone if the flight is cancelled due to covid-19They say it is beyond their control. We can either get a credit of $2750 (the price we paid) toward future travel (which must be completed by April 2022 or get a refund (less penalty charges ) for $1900.Edited: 7:53 am, April 29, 2020 "
Is what Air Canada are doing even legal - my reading of the attached is that if they cancel the flight they are obliged to provide a refund.The references to being outside their control seem to relate to compensation.https://otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/flight-delays-and-…
"how did you manage this? I've called twice and they refuse to give us a full refund. We were scheduled to go June 3rd and they cancelled on us.Edited: 9:19 am, April 29, 2020 "
apparently they are getting away with it. https:/…
thats incredible. I've called twice and am not given the option
"Lindsay - start asking them for a full refund on twitter. Nobody wants bad publicity, it may work, no harm trying"
The Cdn govt approved the use of vouchers. They cannot afford to bail out airlines. We are going to be in a deficit for the next 20 years.
when i called they said its based on the original cancellation policy of your ticket. Ours had a cancellation fee of $300 per person so this would cost us $600 in cancellation fees and $212 in seat selection that they werent going to refund. These terms were based on us cancelling however - not the airline. So we are offered the credit ... or take the loss - those were our choices they said
