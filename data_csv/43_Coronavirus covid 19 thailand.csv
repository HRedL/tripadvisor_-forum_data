Well about time somebody did a proper post for this. Yes covid 19 is in thailand no it's not currantly in lockdown. Yes you could catch it on the plane or ferry your travelling on. So here the risks for you 2 weigh up. If by the time you land here you have a high temp you will be quarantined in thailand for 14 days so if you've booked a week prepare for some serious issues if you have bot bought enough money. Consider the possibility of being quarantined for 2 weeks plus before travel and think about the 2 ferry so far that have been locked down 2 miles of phuket alone so far. Remeber there is no nhs so you cant just pop in for a checkup. Remeber that thailand is less likely to promote real virus figures as stated this week from Phuket chief that updates to the public have been withheld by order of bangkok which is worrying as there are no updates on real infections or amounts infected. If after all the above. You still travel wag a mask with goggle on the plane or ferry as this is the most dangerous part of the trip as the cabin filter on planes and boats do not filter out covid 19. And good luck travelers
You didn't think 400+ threads all on the same subject over the last several weeks was enough ?
"YahooooooAnother 1st time poster thinking they are posting something original, but is about 1000 posts to late."
And with misinformation/bad advice
BTW filters on planes DO filter out COVID-19
