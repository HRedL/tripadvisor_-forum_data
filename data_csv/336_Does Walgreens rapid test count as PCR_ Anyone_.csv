I have read through the boards and am still not sure. Could someone who has entered into Alaska answer if this test counted at the airport. I know they won't do it for under 18 but 5 of us are over 18 but I don't want to bother with that test if it doesn't count. Thanks
Do you have a link/url to such testing?I searched ‘Walgreens COvid rapid testing’ and don't get anything substantial.
I think you need to find a place that will also test the under 18 year old. Otherwise that person will need to be quarantined. And it makes no sense for only one of you to be quarantined
"Nobody on this forum is a health expert, and even if we were, the authorities in Alaska wouldn't have to listen to us.First contact your local Walgreens to find out *exactly* what kind of test they offer. Then e-mail the governor's office and ask him if that is acceptable, he's the one who makes the rules: https://gov.alaska.gov/"
Oh I would get him tested but for us the Walgreens is currently free and fast. Results within 24 hours...So I'd rather get most of us tested there and then my one kid somewhere else.
"This is what Walgreens site says: ""Specific COVID-19 tests and the amount of time it takes for patients to receive results will vary by location"" https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/covid19/testing#!"
Yes ours are less than 24 hours so I would think would be the rapid test. I'll have to call Walgreens and ask and see but it's looking like it's a rapid test which looks to not work from another board....
"I believe at least in Georgia the Walgreens and CVS tests are rapid PCR (Abbott Labs, I think) which as I understand it, does qualify. The other rapid test discussed is the antigen test by Quidel which I don't believe qualifies because it is not PCR."
"Our test from Walgreens was accepted at the airport and we were allowed entry without issue. I assume it was the Rapid Test but I did not inquire as to the name of the test. But we had the results either later that day or the next day, I don't remember. As others stated, we had to get our child tested elsewhere (at an actual hospital) since Walgreens will not test them."
