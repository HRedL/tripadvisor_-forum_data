"Does anyone know if flights are back up and running from Nairobi to Zanzibar?Also has anyone flown into Zanzibar in the last few days? Did authorities check for a negative covid certificate?Thanks very much,Danielle."
"According to the latest press release Kenya Airways is not allowed to fly to Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro or Zanzibar airports. Rather check directly with Kenya Airways regarding your booking.You will definitely be asked for a negative COVID-19 certificate on arrival on Zanzibar. Don't take any chances, you cannot get a Covid-19 test at Zanzibar airport.www.zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.com"
"Thank you for the info. We are flying with precision instead, do you know if they are in the same position?"
"It apparently is not clear at this stage if Precision Air resumes flights to and from Nairobi. Better check with the airline directly.Please Google the article of The Citizen ""Regional Analysts worried Tanzania-Kenya tiff to hurt tourism"" of 2 August for detailed info."
"Thank you for your feedback. I know it’s probably a question like how long is a piece of string! But do you have any idea or heard any rumours about when flights might restart from Kenya to Zanzibar?Thanks very much, Danielle."
"Apparently there is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday. Let's hope Tanzania and Kenya come to an agreement."
"What I heard is, Precision flights from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro are going to resume on 16th August and from Nairobi to Zanzibar are expected to start on 1st September.Karibu Tanzania,Edited: 6:13 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Thank you both. Please could you keep me updated if you hear anything? We are supposed to fly 2nd September from Nairobi to Zanzibar so with a but of luck, fingers crossed we may still be able to travel!!"
"I suggest close to dates you can ask people in here, hope you will get an updates!!"
"Hi, the tour company Im in contact with in Nairobi called Precision Air who told them they are resuming flights between NBO and ZNZ. Anyone know of a reliable source to find out what flights currently arrive in ZNZ and whether there are some from NBO?"
"Check flightradar24 for real departures and landings on Zanzibar airport. Or call Precision Air, their numbers are on their website precisionairtz.com"
"Yes I emailed Precision Air. Their response:""Kindly be informed currently Precision Air is not flying from or to Kenya due to government issues, as soon as this matter is solved we shall resume our flights like before."""
Thanks Mike. I'm guessing nothing has been resolved from yesterday's meeting then?!
"So my flight on 2nd September has now been cancelled by Precision Airways but it's allowed me to change to the following day. It looks like they have two flights a week available to book now, I'm not sure if that's a good sign or not?!"
There is currently some diplomatic tiff between Kenya and Tanzania which has affected the flights to Tanzania.This however is still in discussion.Air Kenya has started flights to Kilimanjaro but there is strict requirements for the 96 Hours Covid Certificate validity period.This diplomatic row is affecting travel between both countries but it will soon be resolved hopefully.Worst case scenario iif you have the Covid valid certificate on arrival in Kenya is fly to Arusha and fly from JRO to Zanzibar via Air Tanzania.
"I’m trying to go the other way and so far I’ve booked an early morning flight from Dar to Kilimanjaro and then plan to catch the shuttle to Nairobi the same day either from Kilimanjaro Airport itself if they offer a pick-up or after getting to Arusha town.I’m told at the border they’re letting people through with a valid negative PCR test result and also hearing the Kenyan medical team are collecting a sample to test at the border after which they take your details to update you on results and then let you through.There is a handover from the Tanzanian vehicle to the Kenya vehicle, so it’s not one vehicle all the way.Edited: 6:19 am, August 13, 2020 "
"Any news on this subject?I am checking news, but there's silence on this topic. I've also checked with the airlines and both Precision Air and Kenya Airways state that they do not fly to Tanzania now and will resume once this has are sorted."
Hi Mike I can find no further information either. At present my flight is still booked for 03/09/2020 that looks to be the first date Precision are flying from NBO to Zanzibar. I'm just hoping and praying the two countries sort things out by then!
Has anyone heard any further rumours about flights? I emailed Precision about our flight on 3rd and they told me to check again on 1st Sep! I really wanted it sorted before we leave the UK as I'll have to change our return flight if we can't get to Zanzibar. Any information would be much appreciated! Thank you.
"They advertised here the following:The wait is finally over! We are resuming our flights between Dar es Salaam/Zanzibar and Nairobi from the 3rd of September. Book your flight now by clicking... (can't add photo of it here, please check it on my Facebook page Zanzibar Insider Buzz)"
"Oh my god, really? That's fantastic news! Thanks very much for that, I'll go on now and have a look. Thank you, Danielle."
You are most welcome. Enjoy your holiday on my beautiful island!
Thank you! I have just requested to join your Facebook group too :)
"Very bad news, just received this from Precision Air: On Wednesday, August 26, 2020, wrote:Dear GabyKindly be advised that they will update it on all of our social media that we will start to operate OctoberWe apologize for any inconvenience causedRegardsWalter"
Oh no!!! I could cry. This is so disappointing. Do you know if this would be the case with all airlines? Is there no other way of getting there from Nairobi?
"Did you book your flight (from UK?) with Kenya Airlines? If so, best contact them directly to find out if they made alternative arrangements to get you to Zanzibar. Failing that you might have to cancel your ticket and book with another airline. There are no flights at all, even smaller airlines, from Nairobi to Zanzibar. I do not recommend that you travel from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) by shuttle, and fly from there to Zanzibar. Good luck!"
"""I do not recommend that you travel from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) by shuttle, and fly from there to Zanzibar."" Hi GabrielaMalaika, why not? Any issues you've heard of? Or just the time it takes?"
"We booked directly with precision Airways. As far as I can see there are no alternatives so we will just get a refund. Unfortunately we won't be able to visit Zanzibar this time around. Never mind, there's always another trip!"
I am so sorry for all the stress. It is not the fault of Precision Air. There is a diplomatic wrangle between Kenya and Tanzania which started early this month. We hope that they resolve the issue rather sooner than later.
