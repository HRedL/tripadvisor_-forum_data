"At the time of this writing, Iceland is suppose to open their borders from US visitors on May 15th. We have a flight on Icelandair, arriving on this date in the morning. With 90% of the staff being furloughed, Is this airline even planning to run on that date?They seem to have run a couple of flights from Boston lately and we can easily move our US domestic flight to this location to make the flight if there is one...Anyone has a crystal ball?"
"tomorrows only scheduled flights to London and Stockholm are cancelled, if that is a good guide"
Now what do you mean by opening borders? No more quarantine?
"Yes that is correct. Unfortunately, although we can travel there, I am not sure Icelandair will honor their flight with a skeleton crew of 10% or less of their staff..."
I am scheduled to fly out of JFK on the 24th. I haven’t received a notice of cancellation and my flight status on the app is On Time. I looked at the JFK departure board and there’s a flight leaving for Iceland tonight. I assume everything is good.
"This is total nonsenseThere is absolutely nothing in local Icelandic mediathat would indicate Iceland has opened their border.That is the first place one would read of this news, astourism is critical to Iceland's economy. If this was true, it would be major news in Iceland. But there is nothing. As the OP has not provided a link, I do sense this is not an accurate post.If it was it would show up here:"

"Icelandair made an agreement with the Iceland government to run a limited number of flights through early May to Boston. I can't remember the date, possibly the 5th or 6th? The flights were to repatriate citizens of both countries. No one knows what is going to happen once that agreement ends. Most of the flights that they show leaving are carrying cargo only. From comments here and on Facebook, they are not giving notice of cancellation until a week before flights."
"JohnRobert78,I hope you understand that Icelandair has shutdown.The fact that your app shows your flight ""on time"" means little. There is no one at Icelandair to change what you see on the app, because they are all on furlough.I do understand your desire to see Iceland, a verybeautuful country, but I also understand the desire of the people in Iceland to remain safe from covid-19.The government of Iceland has done a wonderful job of eraticating covid-19 from Iceland.I really wonder how Icelandic people feel about opening their border to tourists that may very well contain the corona-19 virus. Tourism is the lifeblood of the Iceland economy, but do they want to this virus brought back into Iceland by return of touristsbefore proper testing?"
"drr,I sure hope they open and I can go, but I'm not counting on it."
https:/… No indication of a definite change of policy at this time.
"The title of the post is miss-leading, OP is actually asking if they are open or not, while from title it seems like he is claiming they are (which is false).There is no concrete news yet either from Iceland or from Schengen on what will happen after 15h of May. There is a meeting of Schengen leaders bound to happen on Monday to discuss the tourism for the summer so I would assume we will know more after that."
"IDRR49,t is funny that you mention Iceland monitor website, as it where I read it first..Here is the link from the government, since it seems easier to shoot the messenger, vus doing a search yourself:https://utl.is/index.php/en/about-directorat…It remains to be seen if they will open the borders on the 15th, but being that Europe is opening on this date, we can be hopeful. However, since Icelandair has shut down and no other airline from the US is flying there, this is a mooth point anyway...Edited: 1:14 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Well, how long will it take Icelandair to get back operational if they get the green light?"
"“but being that Europe is opening on this date”Can you give a source for this? I believe that France have extended their state of emergency and 14 day quarantine for incoming people until end of July.https://www.france24.com/en/20200502-france-…Reading the Icelandic article, there is nothing to suggest that the border will open 15th May. The information is 3 weeks old. I would suggest that this will be reviewed nearer the time."
"I have been to Salisbury, smudge. Neat little town.2020 sucks for travelers."
"Like drr49, I see a lot of nonsense written in this thread. Please understand the following: The fact that entry is closed officially until the 15th of May does NOT in ANY way indicate that they already have decided that they will open on that date. It just means that this is the duration for which the CURRENT regulations are valid. After that date there will be issued new regulations which will be valid until another future date. When we get closer to the 15th, a new assessment of the situation will be made and decisions will be taken based on the current situation. There is nothing that indicates that the ban on entry will be lifted on May 15th."
This is the official website for covid-19 in Iceland: https://www.covid.is/sub-categories/tourists. Looks like it is prolonged to the 15th of May (included).
"This article would indicate that the Icelandtourism industry is not expecting a return tonormal before late summer (August) at the earliest. Things could always change, but not in May, so it would seem.https:/…"
"Just in case there is still anyone left that thinks that Iceland will open soon to tourists: One more news article regarding the reopening of the borders:https:/…What can be derived from the article is that the Icelandic government is indeed very keen on reopening for tourism, but that it is still a long way from happening. And, not surprisingly, when it happens it will probably in the beginning be a limited opening under certain conditions only for visitors from certain countries, presumably those where the pandemic has been/is under most control. This is similar to what is being disucssed in several other European countries at the moment. This probably means that an opening of the border for tourists from some of the countries that have previously constituted some of major groups of visitors to Iceland, such as the UK and the US, is even further away."
