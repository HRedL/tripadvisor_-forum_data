The embassy said there are restrictions...the hotels are saying we are good. It's very confusing. We are set to arrive on Sunday.
I have a similar question. I’m due to fly into Portugal on June 22nd from New York (connection in Dublin). I have both USA and UK passports. I’m trying to find out whether I’ll be able to enter Portugal and whether I’ll need to quarantine?
It seems to be unclear right now. There is information and a discussion about this here: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18910…
"There's nothing unclear... NOBODY with a valid passport was ever refused entry in Portugal, even during the State of Emergency. People are confusing an EU recommendation for flights out of EU with refusing people's entry in countries. Not yet recommended for flights to return in full, BUT this doesn't mean that those few flights that exist are for nationals only, it's for everybody."
"Hi, Portugal is open but isn't the ban of travelling from Europe to US still in place?The exception is the UK!Edited: 7:28 am, June 12, 2020 "
"There were always flights Portugal-USA, limited to a couple of towns and a couple of flights per week. Now the airlines are all announcing an increase in the number of flights starting on June 15 and the goal is to have more than 50% of the normal routes/flight schedules operating by August. The airport site shows all flights landing and departing https://www.ana.pt/en the passengers are not all portuguese..."
"As per this CNTavel article, no.By the way, this article was amended a day after I purchased my tickets to include this VERY IMPORTANT sentence: ""The Portuguese government requires that all entry be reciprocal, so visitors from the U.S. without a Portuguese passport cannot currently enter. (This policy will remain in place until the U.S. lifts restrictions on visitors from Europe.)""Full article: https://www.cntraveler.com/story/flights-to-…I've read and heard so many conflicting reports. The only thing keeping me sane is that I'm not flying until July 19, so have some time for it to sort itself out. Those traveling earlier - please keep us all posted!"
mkayd we are all crossing our fingers for you and waiting to hear your report. I’m planning on flying to Lisbon the last week of June if US tourists are allowed in. Please keep us posted on your trip!
"I am hoping someone can confirm. My flight from United States to Lisbon, Portugal is to start at the end of June and I have not seen any consistent information about if I will encounter any troubles in travel as an American. Any info about this would be very much appreciated. I already took the time off of work and arranged care for my pets. I really need a vacation but do not want to create a massive mess if I will be refused entry or get stuck there."
"Hi,This Will answer you question:https://www.visitportugal.com/en/node/421189You cannot travel to Portugal without a Portuguese passport or residence. Has long has the US remains close to European flights the same will happen for Europe regarnding the US, the exception is the UK."
Can someone post when they get there to determine whether they can enter or not? I am looking to book a ticket for the beginning of August as soon as possible.
NO! Things may change at the end of next month. They are open to Portuguese citizens and a very select group people. They are supposed to open to EU citizens in 2 days...but things are always changing.
"So Mkayd, did you choose not to travel, or were you turned away at an airport? And from where did you get clarification?"
"Mkayd, Were you told the end of next month as in the end of July things may change? Who provided this information?"
"From Portuguese immigration, United and Lufthansa."
"Hi,As I said, currently, you cannot enter in Portugal without a Portuguese Passport or a residence autorisation. As long the US maintains the borders close to European flights, Europe will do the same to US flights, it's called reciprocity. The only citizens flying between the 2 countries are the ones with citizenship or residence. The internal EU borders will slowly reopen starting at 15th of June with several restrictions in place.The European Commission has also proposed the gradual lifting of restrictions at the EU's external borders from 1 July thus only then, maybe, you'll be able to fligh to Europe, Portugal included.That simple."
"They are letting people buy tickets, but if you are a US citizen just traveling, you will not get into Portugal. I was told there are a lot of people still trying to get home and transiting through other countries."
"The border is close to US flights.Ask the Portugal embassy for more information:mail@embport.orgEdited: 3:34 am, June 15, 2020 "
"So i think there is good news, but maybe someone else can help figuring out what this means.5612-A/2020, de 19 Maio, this is the name of the resolution regarding travel restrictions. It used to be available on this link: https:/…maximizedIt was supposed to expire today and also as you can see the link doesnt work anymore.Does this mean the resolution isnt active anymore?Edit: Also a lot of information that goes around is simply false, i flew myself from germany to portugal 2 weeks ago, even though this was officially not allowed. There was supposed to be checks, but obviously there was absolutely nothing, we just walked in.Edited: 2:04 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"Hi Alex H,If you read my post carefully I wrote somewhere the reciprocity necessity, that means if the US doesn't allow Portuguese citizens to enter, Portugal and the EU will do the same. For example, today many countries open up their air borders but Greece is not allowing citizens from Italy, Spain or Portugal to come in. So, what do you think Italy and the others will do? Italy already said that no Greek citizen will enter in Italy as long this will be in place, Portugal also asked for explanations to the Greek authorities.The resolution 5612-A/2020, de 19 Maio says exactly that.Another example are the borders between Spain and Portugal that will remain close until the 1st of July with a few exceptions in the north"" Also a lot of information that goes around is simply false, i flew myself from Germany to Portugal 2 weeks ago, even though this was officially not allowed"" Who said it was not allowed? The state of emergency ended up at May, 2nd, so you could do the journey (..but you had to have one of the allowed reasons to do so...)"
Nobody asked me about any reason to come here though. So at this point its just political theater thats not even related to the virus anymore? So frustrating..

"Use this oficial site to see what are the restrictions in place:https://reopen.europa.eu/ptJust put the destination country...Edited: 4:48 am, June 16, 2020 "
"I got this from my local Portuguese Consulate office in Canada.This should similarly apply to Americans as well._Reciprocity_ DOES apply. I will not buying any tickets until July at the earliest.---Until June 15th, nationals from the following countries are entitled to fly into Portugal:• nationals of EU Member States and Schengen associated countries and members of their families under Directive 2004/38;• passengers on flights from CPLP, RAS, Canada, USA, UK and Venezuela, authorized under the terms of no. 1 of dispatch no. 3427-A / 2020, and provided that reciprocity of treatment in these countries is ensured;The following individuals are also entitled to fly into Portugal:• citizens holding a residence permit, researchers and health professionals and humanitarian aid workers in the exercise of their functions, persons with identification documents issued by the MNE under the terms of article 87 of Law 23/07;• citizens repatriated through the consular assistance mechanism, applicants for international protection, citizens traveling for urgent professional reasons duly proven, nationals of the CPLP under health protocols for urgent and urgent medical acts, citizens whose entry is justified on humanitarian grounds) .Given that Canadian borders are presently closed to Portuguese nationals, due to lack of reciprocity, Canadians cannot presently fly into Portugal.After June 15to prolong the application of the current travel restriction on non-essential travel to the EU until 30 June 2020. Applying the coordination mechanism set out under Chapter V, the intervening period should be used by the Commission and the Member States to prepare a list of those third countries for which travel restrictions can be lifted as from 1 July 2020. That list should be regularly updated in line with the criteria set out in this Communication. For all third countries that are not on that list by 30 June, the Commission recommends that Member States prolong the travel restriction on non-essential travel until they are put on the list of countries where travel restrictions could be lifted."
"I have flight from Newark to Lisbon on July 19, so I've been following closely.This was posted on TAP AIR site yesterday: Traveling from the United Stated to Portugal:US citizens will exceptionally be allowed into Portugal for essential trips that prove they have accommodation, means of subsistence and proof of return to their country after their stay in Portugal or that, for proven urgent professional reasons, need to travel.I don't usually book accommodations in advance, as I'll be traveling for a few weeks throughout the country, but if thats all it takes, I'll adjust my strategy!"

Check the official site here for the reopening:https://reopen.europa.eu/ptContact the Portugal embassy here:info.washington@mne.pt Don't trust any other information
"Did you get any reply from the embassy in US? Because the embassy in Canada told me to go to the consulate, and the consulate tells me the reopening is in July. And reciprocity “can” apply. Very vague, indeed."
What if i am travelling from the US (New York) and flying to Lisbon or Porto i am BRITISH and MEXICAN passport.Nowhere that i read covers the case of a European in USA flying to a European country that is not his own.Yes I can go to UKNo i dont want to go there because id have to quarantine for the duration of my trip so i want to spend my summer elsewhere.

"I talked to a lawyer and he explained me the situation like this. If you dont have an actual visa to portugal you will get visa exempt, but this visa exempt is from shengen.

So went to Newark airport yesterday and talked to a TAP airlines agent as long as u have a return flight and proof of accommodation there you are all set!So safe travel and stay safe everyone. And yes as a US citizen!
"That's a relief to hear Mnado80...so there was no consideration about ""essential"" travel in this case?Curious to hear about the people that took yesterday's (6/18) flight from EWR on TAP: if they had any issues as US Citizens or other in getting through..."
They were checking in with no pb. There is no consideration for essential.
"Good for you. But now that IATA site had just changed, maybe the information hasn't trickle down to the airlines yet. For the time being, YMMV, i guess."
"@Alex HI am not sure if Shengen visa exemption applies here. This is an extraordinary circumstance. People in the Shengen area are supposed to cross land border unimpeded. But now, land borders are closed. That tells me that any border arrangement of countries in the Shengen area no longer applies, including the Shengen visa exemption. Any country can choose whoever they allow in. The authoritative source for this information is the Portuguese immigration office. But they are not replying my email.Everyone else is just doing the best they can to keep up with the latest information. I won't be buying tickets until the dust settle. I heard on the news in Thailand few days ago, a couple went into some kind of custody because the airline allowed them to fly into Thailand but they are not Thai nationals. So, no, I wouldn't believe words from airlines, TAP or Delta or otherwise.Edited: 11:34 am, June 19, 2020 "
@mnado thank u for posting! Any idea of UK citizens flying from USA to Portugal?
The US embassy site is pretty clear. https:/…
"@avonrodIt says:US citizens who are Lawful residents of EU member states may enter Portugal.—-Im not a US citizen im a green card holder w a uk passport, so im not sure what to do!"
"@BamakoShivanOk. Well. It doesn’t matter though. I would think as long as EU citizen, u can enter. But to my knowledge, UK is legally no longer part of EU, as of Jan 31 this year. There are still some agreements that are in effect for the transition period. But as far as legal language, u r no longer EU citizen. So I don’t think u can enter. If u go to IATA web site, citizens of UK are also not mentioned in list of countries allowed to enter; which supports my interpretation."
"@avo There is seperate language i found that sice the US/Uk have so many portuguese they need to let those ppl in see below:A “prorrogação da interdição do tráfego aéreo com destino e a partir de Portugal de todos os voos de e para países que não integram a União Europeia” (UE), admite exceções, como é o caso dos países associados ao Espaço Schengen (Liechtenstein, Noruega, Islândia e Suíça), os países de expressão oficial portuguesa, bem como o Reino Unido, os Estados Unidos da América, a Venezuela, o Canadá e a África do Sul, dada a presença de importantes comunidades portuguesas.From:https://www.wort.lu/pt/portugal/covid-19-por…"
"Yea, but you are not Portugese :)Anyway, no use arguing what other sites say when the IATA site is crystal clear that you can't board the flight."
"Just to add the airlines often do not have the right information regarding entry requirements etc. If you frequent the air travel forum you’ll see many cases of it. Best to check with the embassy or official government website instead.However, is the advice from US government still not to avoid all unnecessary travel?"
@avoRules dont say you have to portugueseAlso on EU Rules - the UK should be treated as a member state until Dec 31 2020 - this is the point of the transition period

@nyplayThere’s a paywall to that article. Anything about Canada?
"nothing about canada in the article. sorry about the paywall. I hear that the official word will be out shortly, and will have the full list of countries allowed. Canada should be ok I think. we will get stuck in the brazil and russia category."
@nyplayInsider information or gut feeling? :)
"Although the EU may not allow US citizens in it is still ultimately up to the individual country to determine who comes in correct? I understand the EU obviously wants everyone to follow the same, but it looks like Portugal has been a little different in their thoughts since day 1."
"no inside info, avonord. just what I have read and heard online and in other media. (sorry if I gave a different impression.) The Times article had off the record info from multiple sources. My understand is that, yes, each country operates its immigration and thus in theory at least could go against Brussels wishes. The big club that Brussels has, however, is that intra-EU borders could again be closed (something that the powers that be do not want to happen) and so a country that does not go along could see its EU tourism shut down because of the allowance of entry from countries with high covid-19 spread. (Ironically, this is exactly what Portugal did vis-a-vis Spain, when the latter announced it was pre-emptively opening its border. As stated elsewhere in this forum and others, all of this is a much bigger and unclear mess than it should be. But I would not bank on entry until further notice and clarification. For what it's worth, we are grappling with this issue in New York where the governor is working on a plan with neighboring states to quarantine travelers arriving from states that have not flattened the curve. Since we have no ""borders"" between states that can legally prevent entry, quarantine is the only viable option. (I suspect also that were US visitors to be allowed in Portugal, there would still be a quarantine making it unworkable for a casual tourist."
@nyplayFound your article on Seattle times. https:/…1
glad you found it! The Times promised not to paywall stories about covid-19 but I guess this one got labelled as air travel or something else.
"This is absolutely correct. Entry will be not be reciprocated until the U.S. lifts it's ban on Portugal. Until that happens U.S. citizens can NOT visit Portugal for tourism.Edited: 9:30 am, June 24, 2020 "
"Anyone counting on Portugal doing something different than the pending EU ban on US passengers may want to rethink their plans. They talk about it but in reality I doubt any EU country is going to risk going against this ban. They said they will ""revisit"" this every couple of weeks but the way the US is going right now...I think summer in Europe is off the table. Not what many want to hear and many will still not believe it but that is what it looks like. Guess one can still hope for Fall but again very uncertain. And have to see how EU tourism within the borders goes."
I plan to fly from New York to Lisbon via Dublin — I have a UK passport so I’m hoping I’ll get in. But if it’s a case of anyone flying from the US is not let in then I guess I’ll be stuck.
Look at Covid 19 rates in the U.S. as a whole(not by the individual state). Would you let us in if you were in charge of another country.... presently we couldn't find our ass with our own two hands...

"I agree with Gene. And the question re entering via Dublin: you'd have to get past DUB. This is a specific question to which there will be a specific answer, at the time, but I would not assume anything. (It doesn't sound like you are planning to just roll the dice.)"
Entering via Dublin is irrelevant. You’re still a US citizen and US citizens are not currently allowed into the EU for tourism.
Non-business travel to Portugal planned for July 13. US citizens. Has anyone had first hand experience with this scenario?
Same here. July 19. Its not looking good. It seems Americans are now getting turned away at the gate.
Yes it happened to me yesterday eventho last week i drove to Newark asking if i could fly and was told yes
Mnado80- did you get turn away at the airport!? I am so sorry if that was the case.... we were looking forward to your post from Portugal...
It's official now. No US visitors until further notice. (And note that the US still prohibits EU visitors.)
“Almost” official. List not confirmed til tomorrow. And it’s just a recommendation from EU.

"I also ponder the theory that the U.S. does not want to open the borders to international tourism because our government wants to keep U.S. holiday money within. Possibly the U.S. is aware that we have handled COVID 19 in a disastrous fashion. It knows that the EU is not going to open up to U.S. tourism because of our infection numbers. So the U.S.feels they might as well keep the gates closed to the EU( reciprication factor),bc many American travelers would flock to Europe to holiday since the EU has a better grip on COVID than we do.
