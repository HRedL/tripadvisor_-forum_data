"Many hotels are closed. Hard to klnow if at least a few will permanently fold, but let's hope not.There's a real danger that like many 'less developed' nations, Philippines may be under-reporting COVID-19, although my guess is Indonesia would be even worse.As these are archipelago nations with huge numbers of villages where residents lack a major tertiary hospital nearby, testing and diagnosis will be lacking."
Stay safe :)
"According to my well placed contact, ECQ has now been extended until April 30.Stay happy campers!"
"where do I find ""Official"" updates (not rumor) on the ECQ and travel restrictions / requirements - imposed by the Philippine Government - specifically affecting foreigners that wish to arrive on international flights from abroad and exit Manila city limits for their homes outside the NCR ? I am attempting to return to my home in Angeles City, Pampanga form the USA."

"If you are one of the exempted from the travel ban (Filipino citizen, foreign permanent resident, foreign spouse, foreign child, or a diplomat), then you don't have to change it as long as your flight won't be canceled and if you are allowed to transit via Abu Dhabi (Look for Abu Dhabi travel restrictions).If you are a foreigner with a non-essential visit, then we do not know if the travel ban will be lifted on your travel date.As per the immigration website, travel ban is implemented until further notice. Unless we have a crystal ball, we cannot definitely tell when exactly the travel ban will be lifted.You can take the risk. Assess the probability. Then make your decision.For me it is better. Which date should you change it? I don't know. For others opinion or advice, I don't know. For you, I don't know.We can give opinion as of the moment but we cannot back it up with facts since the implementation of the policy has an uncertain effectivity.Manila will end it's Enhanced Community Quarantine in May 15. After May 15, it will be turned into a General Community Quarantine which is a more relaxed lockdown, but according to the news, GCQ will allow a reduced capacity commercial flights for essential travels and those that are not covered by the travel ban, however we still don't know how long will this be implemented. Just like ECQ that was extended 2 times, it could happen with GCQ too.So to be able to enter the Philippines in June 3, it's better if you are one of the exempted and your travel is essential.If not, you can try but take note that the travel ban is implemented until further notice as stated above and if you ask my opinion, I think it won't be lifted even in June, especially if you consider the current situation of the UK as one of the factors to continuously impose the travel ban."
From 16 May 2020 a few areas like Metro Manila and Cebu City have 'modified' quarantining arrangements for the community.
"As far as tourists are concerned, there is no difference between ECQ and MECQ."
The latest news on Covid-19 in the Philippines: https://www.thephnews.com/?t=Covid
"@ VLI agree, But there is anther side to it here in the Phils. The smaller island might also be more insulated, as many of them have naturally been isolated even before Covid. I mean places like Apo island, Cacnipa island, Balicasag island, etc. and not the big cities. Of course, the fact that there are so many Filipino health care workers around the world also places them more in harm's way, which is sad."
"Metro Manila (capital) and other provinces and outside cities are still on General Community Quarantine (GCQ) until at least June 30. Still, no certainties if GCQ will be lifted/extended in the capital and other areas after June 30.On the other hand, Cebu City was brought back to Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) or a strict lockdown until at least June 30. Cebu province stays on GCQ.The rest of the Philippines aside to those that stayed in ECQ, MECQ, and GCQ; were eased to Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ) (almost normal with basic restrictions).For more details, please visit:https:/…This has the complete list of areas under ECQ, MECQ, GCQ, and MGCQ."
In NCR it is already in GCQ but unfortunately the cases are steadily rising the hotspot of coronavirus in the Philippines is currently in Central Visayas I think ECQ is still implemented there..Reference: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/06/2…
"Not only that, here in Cebu city, they have cancelled all quarantine passes, and they are planning to introduce a total lockdown in parts of the city, but hey are still unsure where and how exactly - I learned about this just minutes ago. Problem is, decisions are brought unexpectedly, most of the time late at night and with no notice at all, they come into force by the time news portals manage to write about them. I was hoping to be able to leave the Philippines in July, but there are still no flights, just promises from airlines that they will restart operation."
we badly need to get back in business.www.wayfreelancing.com
wearing mask is the new normal now and we need to deal with it until such time that we have vaccine or medicine to kill the virus..https://jadhfvaservices.wordpress.com
