"There was an interesting article in the Washington Post about whether or not pets can get this. I'm not going to talk about that, rather I am trying to sneak this off topic post ""under the radar."" In that post the lady talked about how her dog once ate a whole plate of jalapeno poppers with no ill effect. What has your pet survived eating? I will start with my dear departed Abby. I had a Papa Murphy's pizza sitting on the counter waiting for the oven to heat up. The whole family was in the adjacent living room, just out of view. I came back to put the pizza in the oven and it was gone. I found the empty baking tray under the dining room table. Not one of us heard a peep as she ate the whole unbaked pizza. Dawgs. You gotta love 'em. (She died of old age years later.)Edited to say: Please, even if you don't like me personally, can we have a topic or two that are unrelated to the corona virus? Please don't shut it down just because. Thanks.Edited: 8:01 am, March 27, 2020 "
Good topic. Our Boston Terrier ate a box (not kidding) of Andes Mints. She took great pride in peeling off the wrappers (scattered all around the room). No ill effects thank goodness. She also liked to snack on the ends of plastic clothes hangers while we were out which landed her at the vet and cost us a bundle to have a huge ball of stuff removed. Still with us and best dog ever.

You have Covid-19 in the title!
"My English Bull Terrier will eat whatever is in front of him , his taste buds dont work im sure of it . Anything that casts a shadow he will eat ."
"Is that cricket or rounders, Surrey?When my children were small, my dearly departed dog ate the entire contents, packaging and all, of the Christmas goodies cupboard. 4 Boxes of Chocolates (for teachers) several Chocolate Oranges, 2 Christmas Puddings, a large Christmas Cake, bag of Chocolate Xmas Tree decorations, 2 packs of Mince Pies and an entire bag of 24 packs of Crisps. Phoning the vet, he explained the dog had very little chance, (chocolate being poisonous) but to bring him in, they'd put him on a drip and mega expensive 24hr watch. Looking at him bounding around the garden, high as a kite, I let the Gods decide. Dog was fine, (sick once), kids were deprived of goodies and the vet was much poorer!"
Good stories! I will throw one more out there. My dasha (who came from Isla making this thread travel related) once went in the shower and took a disposable razor from the ledge And chewed all around the blades leaving what looked like a pile of shiny dental floss. No blood anywhere. Oh dasha.
Oh.... I see this was moved to the layover lounge. I didnâ€™t need to try to be sneaky with an off topic post. I originally posted in the Isla Mujeres forum.
Our collie will eat just about anything. She does have some taste as the only think she has ever spat out is a hash brown from McDonalds.She is very partial to the taste of cayenne pepper bandage wrappers that were advertised as 'no dog will lick these'.
