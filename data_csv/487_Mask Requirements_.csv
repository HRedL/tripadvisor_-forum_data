"My family is planning to spend a few nights in Pigeon Forge this August. I was wondering what are the general requirements and expectations regarding wearing a mask when going to restaurants, attractions, sites, etc. Just would like to know what to expect and what the general consensus appears to be (each state seems to have their own rules and requirements, hard to keep up with. We will be coming from NYC)."
"The Governor of TN has instituted the Tennessee Pledge that asks each person to practice social distancing, have good hygiene, and wear a mask in public. https:/…tennessee-pledge.htmlHe doesn't want to mandate this and trusts that everyone will follow it.Edited: 12:22 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"We were just there last week. Only servers in the couple of restaurants we went to had on masks. We did have to wait outside as seating is limited in many places. We only went in a few stores and few people besides the employees had on masks. We went to Publix and most everyone had on masks there. Gatlinburg had about 50% of the people wearing masks. The only attraction we did was Alpine mountain coaster In Wears Valley. . Only a few people besides the employees had on masks there. In Townsend many people used them there at the grocery store and at Apple Valley store. Most restaurants asked the 5 questions about being ill, having a fever, etc. so did the wine tasting place."
You might want to ask this question again about a week before your trip. A lot can change between now and August.We were there in May and not alot of people wearing mask or social distancing and only half the restaurants asked us the Covid19 questions.Anyways I hope you have a good trip. I'm sure it will be nice to get away from the Big Apple a few days.
"According to WCYB in Bristol TN, COVID-19 cases doubled in Sevier County two weeks after Memorial Day."
https://wcyb.com/amp/news/local/covid-19-cas…
"On May 25, Memorial Day, Sevier County had 4 active cases (72 positives, 66 recovered, 2 deaths).On June 10, total active cases numbered 79 (178 positives, 97 recovered, 2 deaths).Stats are updated daily at 3pm EST here: https:/…data.htmlSocial distancing works. Hopefully this will serve as an illustration of what happens when it is not practiced, and give a wake up call for everyone to “do their part and stay apart” (a TN motto during covid).Edited: 6:50 am, June 11, 2020 "
"4 active cases to over 70 active cases is quite a jump.Have they traced it back to any particular place. I know laws prevent certain specifics to be released but I was wondering if they are contributing this to more testing? If testing does not account for such a huge jump, they will really need to be more strict about masks and social distancing.Dollywood is requiring masks and are using a reservation system when they open. That may change by August."
As of yesterday we had 93 active cases.Health officials still recommend everyone wear a mask when in public but many apparently think they are somehow exempt and immune to it as many aren’t wearing them. It a minor inconvenience in my opinion and should be worn in stores and other places where you can’t keep a good distance from others.
Those cases are really rising. I do hope people will start being smarter about wearing masks and social distancing.

"Here’s another news story with tourism officials asking guests to wear masks, practice social distancing and have good hygiene: https:/…The TN Department of Tourism has also launched an outreach to guests with practical tips and information during this time: https://www.tnvacation.com/travel-safe#Edited: 8:57 am, June 16, 2020 "
This is helpful. We are heading down to Gatlinburg this weekend. So hoping restaurants are requiring staff to wear masks and are keeping tables apart. It sounds like at least some are?
"I am at Dollywood right now. Most people are wearing masks but there are those that aren’t as well. They did take our temperature as we came in but they don’t seem to be requiring masks if people take them off. . As far as restaurants in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, the ones we’ve been to are operating at full capacity with no distancing and no reusable menus. Employees are supposed to wear masks but some wear them below their noses. Most places are crowded. If you are worried about COVID when visiting the area it is probably best to get a cabin and eat in, don’t go to attractions, and stick to less crowded trails when hiking. I’m not saying not to come but from my perspective at this point it appears that more than half the people here are not distancing or masking."
"Would wonder what people believe as the science behind the masks in this area?What happens when people don’t wear them correctly, what about when they touch them constantly with their hands? Do you find everyone is properly practicing the right hygiene there with wearing masks?Are the masks porous enough to stop viruses there in pigeon forge?"
"wvmoz,For an idea of the messaging from Sevier County, check out the government’s twitter feed: https://mobile.twitter.com/SevierCounty They address the proper way to wear masks. The state keeps up to date with the latest information. At every state Press Briefing, the Governor will end his comments with, “Social Distancing works. Do your part. Stay apart” and the health director always reiterates the 3 main points of the TN Pledge before closing her comments: “wear a mask in public, and practice social distancing and good hygiene.” Studies show how when the majority wears them, risk goes way down. Studies have also shown in places where they are mandated, the communities for the most part are not experiencing additional outbreaks. The TN Governor does not want to make this a mandate, but has repeatedly said he is trusting everyone to keep the TN Pledge (wear a mask in public, and practice social distancing and good hygiene). Sevier County officials have repeatedly, as recently as yesterday, urged tourists and residents to adhere to these state guidelines.Just this week, the Governor launched the TN Strong Mask Movement, and a number of businesses state-wide are helping to distribute branded masks to increase the messaging. https:/…I hope that helps.Edited: 12:16 pm, June 20, 2020 "
We just stayed in Pigeon Forge mostly to enjoy the national park but driving around there and visiting Gatlinburg I would say 90% of the people were not wearing masks. It was very crowded over the past weekend and if not for the handful of people wearing masks you would not have known there was a pandemic going on. Employees at establishments are wearing masks and customers are encouraged to wear with some places providing free masks. It seems like a lot of people are willing to accept the health risks to continue enjoying personal freedoms. If you are at all a germophobe I would avoid this area regardless of Covid.
"""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin' at all..."" - Thumper"
I am here now it’s very busy and while the usual 6 foot rule in lines is labeled on a lot of floors it isn’t enforced at all. 20% maybe wear masks maybe less. The employees do wear masks. But not at our hotel I noticed. Honestly you wouldn’t realize there’s a pandemic if you didn’t know other than people who work inside businesses. 2 hour wait most restaurants also it’s that busy.
The Governor of TN has just signed a new Executive Order granting county mayors the authority to issue mask mandates as needed. We should know about Sevier County in the days ahead. Here's more: https://www.wsmv.com/news/gov-bill-lee-grant…
"Knox country just implemented mandatory mask wearing this week when not at home and I expect Sevier county will do the same by early next week. If you come to the area bring a mask and please wear it and try to keep a reasonable space between you and others. If you are sick or think you may be please don’t come and see your doctor. .Edited: 7:36 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Could someone show the scientific data, randomized trials, peered reviewed journals, etc for wearing a mask in this area to prevent the virus?What happens when people are constantly touching masks with hands, pulling and tugging, does that spread the virus? Noticing this in restaurants and many other areas. Does the ear loop masks that create a pouch on both sides of mouth allowing unobstructed air flowing through them ineffective for this area?If people where the same mask over and over, only have their one hand made mask: Is this harmful for those visiting pigeon forge?"
"OZZ / “wvmoz”,See this for more information: https://news.yahoo.com/scientists-ignores-ri…"
"Invest in more than one mask.Use hand sanitizer before touching your mask.I have bought several masks and find that I might need to twist the elastic in a figure 8 to make the mask fit properly. I have even tied knots in the elastic to get the proper fit. I do not go out often but always wash the mask after every trip out.It is a pain but well worth the trouble. Some masks are expensive and are made to keep you cool on hot days.They have done test and without a mask, you need to social distance 8 ft. With a 2 ply cloth mask...2.5 inches. (But still social distance)Nothing is 100% but it is worth the effort IMO.Stay safe."
"A seatbelt isn't guaranteed to save you in an accident, but it sure ups the odds."
if i came now? do i need a mask?
Yes
"I’m not arguing for or against masks..... just saying.... today we were at Tanger, Lowe’s, Big Lots and Knife Works which was super crowded. The majority of people were not wearing masks. As far as masks on the trails..... we didn’t see any. I’ve not been anywhere here that requires a mask.... maybe there are places but I haven’t been to them."
"Jacana,I replied to your question more fully in the other Thread. In short, there will likely be an announcement by Sevier County leaders on Monday. See this for the county's Press Release on July 3: https:/…press-releases.html"
Only one place I saw said required. Earth Bound in Tanger mall the other 2 I went to in the area weren’t requiring them though.
"There is currently no mandates requiring the facial coverings. They are always recommended by Health Officials but there are only a hand few of attractions requiring them such as Dollywood, Dollywood Splash Country, Titanic Museum, and a couple more. Many attractions ask for them to be worn if it is safe for an individual to do so which is great option for tourists with various conditions such as Asthma, Autism, or any other condition that may prohibit you from doing so. Many attractions are encouraging and reinforcing Social Distancing throughout there venues. Hope this helps and have a great trip!!!!"
"All of this could change tomorrow (Monday, July 6). On Friday, the governor of Tennessee announced that counties had the authority to implement their own guidelines (mask requirements, etc.). Sevier County Government announced on Friday that they were reviewing options and would have an announcement on Monday (today, July 6)."
Mandate UPDATE Sevier County Government has released a statement that they are still in consultation with health officials and legal counsel and hope to have a determination on a mask mandate on Tuesday.https://m.facebook.com/story.php…
Thanks for the update. Please let us know what happens tomorrow.
"Per this afternoon's press briefing, beginning Friday, masks are to be worn in all indoor public places. They realize it is impossible to social distance in some areas given the large volume of visitors. The mandate is in effect until August 3 and will be re-evaluated at that time."
