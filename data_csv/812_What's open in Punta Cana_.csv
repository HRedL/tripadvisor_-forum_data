"PuntaCanaMike , perhaps you can help me with this. I will be arriving to PC next Saturday and Staying at Stanza Mare.I was wondering what I can expect to find open within the area regarding Restaurants ,bodegas, bakeris, etc. Also has there been any changes regarding the beach with the new state of emenrgency?Thank you!"
"Good question,i’m arriving sunday. I heard cocobongo and all night clubs are closed."
"Good evening. You will find some restaurants open, like Kat's Corner and Citrus. I was in a meeting today, and it was stated by a lawyer close to the local market, that many have either walked away or will close their doors shortly. The unfortunate reality of how hard all of this is hitting us locally. Both BAM and Cirrocella supermarkets are open as is Foodies(food trucks) just down the road a bit.Buses are running if you have to get down to shop at Jumbo.As for the beach, it was just announced a few hours ago, that ALL BEACHES are closed for 45 days. This will not likely apply to tourists staying at a resort, and this double standard has a ton of people pizzed off, myself included. If the beach is closed...it is closed to EVERYBODY. That is how it should be. After all, it is owned by the people of this country...not the businesses of this country. Why the double standard?The President was supposed to speak tonight, but it was put off until tomorrow for whatever reason. We will better understand the regulations to be put into place later tomorrow.Life here is hard, and it just got harder.Cheers,PCMike"
"Thank you Mike, Honestly, I am just looking for a relaxing getaway. My partner was planning to drive from Puerto Plata to meet me. I wonder if inter- provincial travel will be closed as well :("
The word will come out today as to the regulations. Let's wait and see.
"Beaches closed for 45 days?? Wow... well.. glad I’m not traveling there in July or August! Even if they’re only open to tourists in resorts, one of the things we love to do is walk a few miles a day.. I’m sure that’ll be stopped. December is looking like a good choice.. that’s if they allow us from the US to fly in"
Playa Del Carmen has done the same thing this week. The beaches are closed as are day clubs I believe but those at beachfront resorts still have access as long as the resort still allows it which most seem to be doing.
Looks like the Bahamas is taking it a step further. US citizens are barred as of Wednesday. https:/…
Bump.
Not much
Bump
US citizens should be banned from all countries...
"COVID-19 July 20, 2020 | 2:25 pmCivil Defense clarifies hotel zone beaches to remain open in DR as of july 20"
"James, why should US Citizens be banned? is there another thread I cannot see that explains this comment?"
80% of businesses are closed for good. Alchohol sales are down 94% according to Punta cana Mike.
"With that attitude, James M should be banned from all countries."

I think unless everyone wears a mask we will never get out of this. There are many people in the US who think this is a political hoax and refuse to wear masks or social distance. Sad but true. A selfish stance for sure. I just want to be able to get back to PC and I want my Dominican friends to be able to sustain their families. This is so tragic.
"There are some people in the US who do sadly feel that way but that is also starting to change as more and more the importance of mask wearing is getting out beyond that many states now have mandates that you have to have a mask on legally and beyond that several large businesses such as Wal-Mart, Target and others are requiring mask on to do go there so all of this is leading to far more mask usage in the US in the past few weeks."
Too little too late. When people see the president without a mask and not socially distancing its a problem. My heart breaks for the employees who simply cannot survive this disaster. Why should you have to mandate wearing a mask???? Are we really that stupid or simply selfish?
Well ocean girl.... Maybe have a chat with world health organization. Was just a short time ago they were saying masks are useless. Here in Canada DR Tam ( public health officer of Canada) stated for the longest time the crap the WHO has been spewing. It's no wonder people have conflicting feelings on the subject.
"The primary reason for them recommending only those who are sick wearing masks is because there was a shortage of masks, which are needed by health care providers. That, and they had not yet had evidence to conclude that wearing masks aided substantially in stopping healthy people from getting it, given social distancing. That changed.Mark"
"Ok Mark whatever you believe,,so one day dont use because not enough masks, next use masks even ones made out of you grandmas underwearnot enough evidence to conclude wearing masks help, yet masks have been recommended to be used at my doctors office if you have the common cold or flu,,you starting to see a pattern of failure here yet?"
"and as for the question, why should it be mandated ??well if we go with that theory why should any safety protocols be mandated for anything"
"There's lots that they didn't know about this virus, and probably still don't. They're learning. Trying to put in place methods that will slow, and hopefully stop the spread of this pandemic. They can't do that if people refuse to follow protocols.And they never said don't wear mask if you're sick.MarkEdited: 3:33 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"I think the reason they are mandating them now is because things are opening up and people are getting a false sense of security and letting their guard down. We are trying to get back to ""normal"" but the risk is still there. I agree with Mark about why masks weren't recommended at the beginning. They didn't realize at that time exactly how the virus was spreading, and they needed to save masks for health workers and the seriously ill."
"they knew exactly how it was spreading, they knew it was a SARS virus ,, hence the 6 ft apart,,tim not arguing that masks probably do work,,im stating its no wonder people have reservations on mask use,should it be mandated, probably yes,"
I think it's a mistake to suggest wearing masks is the solution. It's one measure among many. I'm not going about my day wearing a mask all of the time. I'm wearing one when I'll be in proximity to others.Mark
Mark I have never heard anyone suggest wearing a mask when you are alone or within your family circle its only when social distancing from strangers is not possible
I have heard it recommended to wear a mask with ones family if you test positive for Covid but that is the only time.
"Sooooo ... If the people of DR are being mandated to wear masks in public spaces ...why are tourists being exempted . Surely your waiter, bartender, valet, and other guests are strangers. If you choose to travel to the DR should you not be required to follow the same rules as those that live and work there????"
"Agree Jo. Especially when 95% of the guests are arriving from what is considered a ""hotspot"" country. I can't wait until the news comes out in dramatic fashion ""Tourists infected with Corona Virus in the Dominican Republic"". It will only be a matter of time."
Where did it say tourist were exempted from what I have seen of protocols most resorts or at least the protocols I have read they are requiring mask of guest indoors?
"I dont recall seeing any resort mandating the wear of masks indoor. Could be wrong but thought this was for staff only. Guests it's optional. If mandatory for guests, which resort is this?"
Yeah what happened with that SOE? I don't even see the thread. Curious also if there is a curfew and if bars outside of resorts are open.
"In reply # 1 on this thread, there is a link to Hard Rock SOE. The very first point says guests must wear face masks indoors. I would assume most resorts would follow the same guidelines. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g147293…"
"Itchingtogo .... A new SOE was passed last Sunday for 45 days. Curfew is currently in place until August 10 I believe ...in Punta Cana curfew is from 7pm to 5am Monday to Friday and 5pm to 5am on weekends. Bars/ Restaurants etc must be closed during curfew hours.Edited: 3:07 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"Indeed, masks at HR. Not mentioned at Royaltons. Will have to see as more resorts open if they have this mandatory. https:/…covid-19"
"Wow that sounds like a nightmare. Looks like Cancun it is then, thanks for the update. I have a friend trying to convince me to come and I would have been pissed if there is a 5pm curfew"
"I know at Ocean (H10) hotels it was mandatory for all guest to wear mask indoors such as the theater, buffet and lobby bar. It would have been at the disco as well if it were open but they have those shut down which is probably good. They are also looking at doing more shows outside as well. In terms of the buffet they were having people walk around in 1 direction to look at the food available behind glass and then go and tell waiters what they wanted and they would plate go get the food for guest and return it to their table. This worked better than it sounds from reviews of a resort they have open in Mexico."
"@40 You may want to check out the info for Cancun. There is a curfew there as well, and some of the beaches are closed. Their COVID numbers are going through the roof."
"Why wouldn’t you wear a mask when inside? Do you think you’re more important than the employees????????? If you’re not smart enough to wear one to protect yourself, wear one to protect them. They have a lot more to lose than you do."
"Hi, i have booking from end of August and beginning of September in Punta cana, what is situation there with covid cases? I see that there is a huge increase in last few days/weeks, is it worth it coming since everthing is closing at 7pm. I know that traveling is not smart thing to do now but i booked and payed my holidays in February and at this point i am not sure what to do. What's your recommendation is it worth it to come over there because i would like to see something there not just sit around and sunbathing. My this topic is not right to post this here but i will try it"
"If you are staying on the resort, the curfew means nothing."
"We bit the bullet and booked for August at Bahia Principe Ambar. The only reason we booked is because of the safety measures they have in place such as masks being required indoors, strict social distancing and limited occupancy. The curfew / state of emergency will not affect us while at the resort."
"I've always preferred hotels with less indoor space, so many are going to indoor dining, bars, lobbies with with AC, or worse, AC that barely works so no air flow at all! Heck I go down there for the HEAT! More open air restaurants and bars will be safer in this COVID world.Stay safe all.Edited: 10:21 am, July 27, 2020 "
"Onno's have announced they're shutting down again. What a shame. Just as the area was building up a live music bar scene, this happens. I know, there's more at stake than bars and musicians but it was a tough enough business to begin with...many thoughts for the entrepreneurs of the area, forum contributors included."
