"I’m currently booked on a trip this September spending time in Cape Town, Kruger Park and Victoria Falls. Anyone want to ventures any guesses as to whether travel will open up so travelers from the US can go to those places this coming September? I have the option of moving my trip to September 2021, though I’d really love to go this year if it’s feasible."
"On the same boat! I have my trip booked for 9/5-18/2020 to Cape Town, Hermanus and KNP. I think I will have an option to postpone my trip for up to a year, but I am really hoping I can go this year. I have been waiting for this trip since last year. Any chances that things will get better in September? What’s the current situation in Cape Town is like? Thank you everybody for your input in advance."
"The USA is the current hotspot of Covid 19 in the world.. Zimbabwe, Zambia and south africa have just 2500 odd cases total - with 2450 in south africa alone,...I dont see these countries opening up their tourism in the coming months, particularly to countries who havent got it under control.In my country, our prime minister has told us not to expect an easing for 6 months - i wont be planning any overseas travel this year"
Thank you Steve.
"It's all guesswork at present.Nobody can be sure of anything at the moment. Currently reported cases are 2415 as of right now, in South Africa. Some projections are, that numbers will only peak about September. This is the ""tip of the iceberg"", IMO, because:1 poor compliance with lockdown in a number of areas, for several reasons.2 The numbers being reported cannot be an accurate reflection of reality, due to the limited amount of testing that has been done, as a %age of the whole population."
"I think there are several aspects to consider. -Will it be legally possible to travel from the US to South Africa... and back to the US.-Will it be safe to make this trip.-Will the trip be as enjoyable as it should be or will restrictions, limitations, quarantines ruin the trip."
"《hether travel will open up so travelers from the US can go to those places this coming September?》Imo, no. Cases are increasing even under lockdown, and the national task force's expectation is they will rise exponentially once the lockdown ends and we go into winter. No reason to assume that Zimbabwe or Zambia will be any different.Edited: 1:22 am, April 15, 2020 "
You should be concerned about visitors from the US bringing Covid-19 to South Africa if travel restrictions are lifted too soon.
"Seeing as you're already 'booked' to go, what difference does it make what we think? Keep an eye on those cancelation terms and dates and the COVID developments around the world act accordingly as your trip approaches.Edited: 3:49 am, April 15, 2020 "
Hope springs eternal
