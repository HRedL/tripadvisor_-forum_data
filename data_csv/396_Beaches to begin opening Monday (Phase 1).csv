"We are so fortunate to have 75 miles of coastline/beaches in SD. The beaches like so many things that I have taken for granted the past several weeks have been missed, especually this weekend. I hope we can all do our part to allow the beaches to remain open and even move toward Phase 2.https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/san-d…Edited: 6:08 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Thanks for the info Goodbeer. I read the article and I was a bit surprised to read this at the end of the article:""The announcement also added that the county will begin to require residents to wear facial coverings in public starting on May 1."""
"""I was a bit surprised...""No surprise. The weather is warming up and everyone has cabin fever. The health and police departments are concerned that with a partial reopening, people will go hog-wild, the way they did at places like Santa Cruz and San Mateo county beaches before those were closed. A phase 1 opening like this will help answer the question of whether we can or can't have nice things."
"Hopefully people will follow guidelines and openings can start slowly and as safely as possible. Just went to my local Kaiser Pharmacy for the first time in months - so nice to feel safe - took temps, required masks, separated all those waiting by 6 feet..."

It'll the same here in the US. We value personal freedom. That's why opening the economy is going to be a very difficult task.

"I’m wishing you lots of luck. It’s been rough for us with our beaches open and the Silicon Valley just under an hour away. I hope everyone inland respects the SIP you get to enjoy your beach again, if even for just a walk."
Wife and I came home from a drive up to and through PB from our home in Chula Vista. 100% of the people I saw in PB weren’t wearing masks while most people in Chula Vista / Otay are wearing masks. The contrast between the two regions is very apparent. Will be interesting to see if most county residents follow the required mask order after May 1.
Only a very few are wearing masks in pb/mb. A few weeks ago you saw more but now not so much.
"MB Shark, any reason as to why that is?"
"The new requirement will be to "" wear a face covering whenever you are within six-feet of a non-household member."" Are the sidewalks in PB etc so crowded that you can't maintain a six foot distance?"
I'll place bet that SD cases go up.
"The sidewalks and alleys in pb/mb aren't bad and they can distance. You can run into more people at the top of the courts especially near sunset. Mostly I see a lot of people riding bikes down mission blvd, dog walkers, joggers, and regular folks walking.Not sure why people are not being as careful as they were before. Blame it on the nicer weather I imagine. It will be interesting to see how many will abide when the 1st comes. Vons and ralphs say to wear a mask although I still see some people not doing so. It will also be interesting to see our beaches this Monday. Will keep you all posted"
Thanks MB. My friend is a emergency doctor in LA and even during flu season he recommends receiving the flu shot as he has had countless patients die who were otherwise young and healthy from just the flu. He’s working in the Covid unit now and strongly advises wearing masks. Hopefully we can all get through this soon as this quarantine and masks wearing might be our new normal indefinitely.
">>The new requirement will be to "" wear a face covering whenever you are within six-feet of a non-household member."" Are the sidewalks in PB etc so crowded that you can't maintain a six foot distance?<<The new requirement also is everyone will need to wear a mask outside beginning May 1st."
"It will be interesting to see how this works out in San Diego. As the Australian experience demonstrates, the public may not behave appropriately and it will be necessary for the authorities to revoke this liberty. If we all pull together and follow instructions, discipline can be maintained. Of course, any violations must be reported immediately to the authorities. One option might be for the authorities to issue passes to citizens who follow the rules and revoke access to those who don't. This way education efforts could be targeted more efficiently."
"""Are the sidewalks in PB etc so crowded that you can't maintain a six foot distance?"" I think most sidewalks aren't even six feet wide. And even though the boardwalk may be bigger is just as crowded as Moonlight Beach on a busy day. You've got to get of Encinitas every now and then.For what it's worth, and seeing how course people aren't complying, I think it's too soon.Edited: 6:25 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"Good luck trying to put that Genie back in the box. Once you let people out, they are not going to go backward regardless Imo."
They will if there are fewer of them. By which I mean the death rate spikes.
"Think people are just done Imo with all of this. No more deaths than the regular flue in the vast majority of places and we dont do anything special for that. They are also lumping in things like people with heart disease, cancer, etc in those virus numbers regardless if they had pre existing conditions they really died from, and some who just 'appear' to have the virus with no testing. JMO"
Well then it's time for Vegas to open their casinos! You can be the test site.
"Maybe that's why your mayor wants to open the casinos. It's no problem, people die everyday anyway."
"Three arrests in Encinitas in the news, but that was a manufactured drama. Let’s see how this plays out this weekend."

"""Your response isn't travel related and off topic chatter.""TBH, much of the forum talk these days is.

I see no reason why that should change.

"This virus is doing some bizarre things. We don’t even know all that it might be capable of doing, since there are people who have died and maybe are not yet known to have had it. Here is a story about the first known U.S. victim, age 57, otherwise healthy, who was believed to have died from a massive heart attack, but further investigation suggests she had COVID and it infected her heart and essentially blew it up. Another report said evidence of viral infection was found in other organs as well as her heart. So this isn’t your common URI that makes you cough for a week and then goes away. People in their 40s with mild COVID are having strokes more typical for much older folks. And so on.https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Coron…So I’m not going to Huntington Beach or Linda Mar just yet. And if California decides to set up checkpoints at every border crossing to screen everyone entering, or to ban commercial airline or bus arrivals from states where they are treating COVID like the sniffles, I may harbor thoughts about how extreme that is and how it infringes on my rights, but I’ll try to be understanding and remember that every right has a responsibility. When you drive into California from anywhere, an ag inspector asks if you have fresh fruits, veggies, or animals, because any imported pest is a threat to this state’s enormous agricultural economy. Remember the campaign against the medfly a few decades ago? We don’t want a medfly in the form of a human viral illness.My parents lived through the Great Depression, WWII, and the Pearl Harbor attack. My mom grew up in Honolulu, and my dad was in the Army at Schofield Barracks. They but couldn’t get married for years because my dad went overseas, while my mom got a job as a clerk with a federal agency, and that's why I was born closer to the Korean War than WWII. All their mail during that time was censored for security reasons. During those years, the American people lived with rationing of meat, sugar, gasoline, bicycles, shoes, typewriters, and other goods because they, the raw materials, or the processes to make them were needed for the war effort. Buildings had blackout curtains to keep interior lights from being air raid targets, and they had to be closed at night or when sirens announced a drill. We even took patriotism to unacceptable extremes and made many loyal U.S.-born U.S. citizens suffer for actions they had no control over; and decades later, like a country founded on justice does, we (thank you, President Reagan) tried to make amends. People united and rallied in a common cause (thank you, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill), to defeat an enemy that was visible, obvious, and palpable. It had bombed an American naval base and killed thousands of our kids; it was on newsreel footage goose-stepping across Europe and leaving conquered nations and masses of innocent victims behind. A pandemic virus is not as obvious, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a threat. In our more self-indulgent day, when my rights take priority over your rights and even your welfare, if we had to mobilize as a country and sacrifice together as our parents or grandparents did almost 80 years ago, not only for the common good but for our national survival – could we?"
">>""Are the sidewalks in PB etc so crowded that you can't maintain a six foot distance?"" I think most sidewalks aren't even six feet wide.<<Exactly! How do you pass someone on a sidewalk and not get within 6 feet of them?And well said, Valley42. And we seem to be learning that the virus is much more easily carried on air currents than was thought. (See the restaurant in China where the a/c pushed it around the dining room.) I'd hate to see us learn in two weeks that a good ocean breeze can blow aerosolized virus in exhalations further than 6 feet."
"People are definitely coming to the coast to cool off. Yesterday there was a constant parade of cars going down Mission Boulevard. Lamborghini's, convertibles, jeeps, motorcycles all full of people and playing music as they passed. It seems just like any summer weekend less the number of people on the sand and in bars. I wonder where they are going to or if they are just taking a seaside cruise in their vehicles? Today will most likely be the same.There were a good amount of motorcycle and ATV police, along with lifeguards patrolling the beach and bay, my hope is that these will remain for a bit to issue citations around the 1st.I will enjoy a walk on the beach (with my mask) or being able to catch some waves tomorrow as we have no open parks to exercise in. Kate sessions is the only one but they recommended not to drive to your neighborhood park and to rather walk. I think many will come to the beaches to do the same and if they don't follow protocols we might have issues later on.For some reason, people can be thickheaded and don't care much about the rules. Stop being so selfish, we are in this together, and your actions can and do affect us all.Stay safe and healthy everyone"
"The Koreans got this mostly under control through great leadership and comprehensive followership. We have lousy national leadership but very good state and local, but 40,000 people descending on a beach town is not a good indication of our capacity for social responsibility.“I can’t breathe” says the individual constitutional rights champion. “I can’t breathe” says the Covid-19 patient."

"State Beaches will remain Closed so that includes Cardiff, Solona Beach, and Torrey Pines. Del Mar is also remaining closed.In Orange County(Huntington and Newport Beach) they are allowing Sunbathing but at Open beaches in San Diego it is not allowed."
"Same story in my town on the Monterey Bay. We’re stuck in our homes and yards while our streets and beaches are full of people from Silicon Valley and beyond. We aren’t to to hang out in one spot but people are anyway and the rangers can only be in so many places at a time. To add insult to injury they are dumping their take out food containers on the street and beach vs. taking it home with them. Where are they going to the bathroom? All our public restrooms are closed. During the week I only see people from the neighborhood on beach walks. The solution is to close on the weekends I guess. Here’s a local news report. https:/…Edited: 3:56 pm, April 26, 2020 "
Reply to #32. East Asians value common good over individual freedom. Western culture is the opposite.
Sometimes media photographs are distorted or depth not shown correctly. So pictures of people who look like they are close together may in fact be farther apart then they seem. Media on both sides of the political world often phrase things to spin a certain way and the same with pictures. Drives me crazy.
40k at Newport Beach. Sounds like a concert at Irvine Meadows. So much for massive crowd gathering. Looking forward to reading how fun it was down the road.
"Jesportland, I agree that some pics distort how really crowded it is, but for me the real problem is anyone coming from out of the area. Southern California has a huge population but given what I see on those beaches that is definitely more people than live in the immediate area. Like has been said, viruses can’t move on their own, people move them. Our general rules is if can’t walk there don’t go unless you have a physical reason why you can’t walk short distance. If people come out of their area they are crowding streets to park in front of homes and exposing essential workers at grocery stores and restaurants. Many of our grocery stores are allowing only one family member to shop unless someone has a physical reason they can’t shop alone. The visitors go in the stores with the whole family and then someone has to confront them and explain the rules every time. If people would just stay in their neighborhood none of this extra work by everyone would be needed. It’s hard enough for essential workers at this time.Edited: 4:27 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"Gov. Cuomo says it every day ... it's what we do that makes a difference in how this virus spreads. We can be smart, as we have been. But if we let up, we'll see the result very soon in cases, hospitalizations and, ultimately, deaths. Californians have done such good and hard work to bend the curve. And we see good results. But now is not the time to celebrate. More hard work has to be done over the next month or so. Stay home. Keep yourself and those people who are essential workers (the real heroes) safe. I wouldn't be out walking on a beach in San Diego today for anything."
"I watched a really good 6 minute video on YouTube about 5-6 weeks ago from an Infectious Disease Expert, the video has since been Deleted.This ""Expert"" says that this Virus is much too Infectious and that without a doubt within 2 years that approximately 70% of the entire Earth's population will have had the virus. He says the virus is far too contagious to contain.He said as they lockdown Countries it will help keep the virus from speading but when they start to ease restrictions the spread will again increase.So then the countries will tighten up restrictions again to slow the virus again.He says it's going to be this Seasaw(Up and Down) for the next 2 years. Tighten up/Ease Up.He said that in the very end.. either a Vaccine is going to be created to stop the spread OR immunity will occur because everyone has already had the virus."
"2112ps, maybe you should google and find a citation for #42 which as it is has little value since you cannot even name this expert."

"I am glad to see that the CA Governor realizes that the “one size fits all” mentality is inappropriate. I fear that many people view the spread and affects of the COVID 19 based on the New York Metropolitan area and selected Urban areas. After all, over 50% of all deaths (included the presumed ones) are from the New York Metropolitan area. Probably no coincidence that a lot of the main stream media is located and reports from that area. Are tight measures and removing of individual rights necessary in select areas of our county? Yes. Personally I think the affected areas should be locked downed and frozen in place instead.Many counties and even some states are minimally affected. Some with more common sense approaches.Do people realize that 45% of all positive COVID 19 cases and 54% of the deaths in CA are in Los Angeles County? Perhaps people from that county should be quarantined?I fully support your Governor as long as measures are in place to monitor the situation. I am suppose to be vacationing in the Joshua Tree and San Diego area right now. I cancelled my trip last month.Best of luck. Driven by the positive cases and deaths in the Greater Chicagoland area, IL continues to be shutdown."
"People should stick a) to the topic (Beaches to begin opening) or b) at least travel related, not pure political comments. City-Datd.com has lovely forum where you can scream all you like about that.As to beaches opening, I haven't been yet, I've been too busy, but I talked to friends who live pretty much on the sand in Newport and they were upset that the people they observed didn't seem to be even considering social distancing or using face coverings.Face coverings and proper sanitation (hand washing esp) combined with testing, seem to have been the key to South Korea's low spread rate."

"I just took my daughter up our court for a sunset walk on the beach. There are people all over the boardwalk (skating, walking, riding bikes, jogging) without a clue. This is not going to end well. I can only imagine the lackluster effort when we are to wear masks beginning on Friday. Disappointed in humans. They will ruin this for us that live here and for you. Shocking to see so much flagrant disrespect, then again that's why we can't drink on the beaches anymore also. :/"
Last weekend ruined it for us. New crackdown coming tomorrow.
Friend at Pacific Beach also found it disappointing.
"With the LA beaches closed, there were way too many Angelinos and Inland Empire residents here in Huntington and also in Zooport last Saturday, and of course the media picked it up and ran. However, in the area north of the pier, we saw that for the most part that people were respecting the distancing, just blowing off steam and behaving. But that's not a good story for the way things are today, is it?"
Still good to hear about. Thanks
"I walked about 5 miles on the beach at Coronado yesterday. Plenty of space. Planning on doing the same this evening. Id estimate 95% of people walking along the water did not have a mask on, although more than 5% did have them around their neck if needed. Up on the sidewalk more did have masks on."
"Today, I walked on the beach from Tourmaline Beach to the lifeguard station (Grand). For the most part, everyone was complying with the rules. There were a few exceptions, but overall, people were respectful of others.I left the beach at Grand Ave. and there was no place to go on the sidewalk...all was still closed off. Thus, I just walked home on Mission.Lifeguards and police were pretty much everywhere."
Not seeing any on the boardwalk tonight in north MB. Everyone is on the sand and water distancing and following rules.
Overcast earlier today at the coast. Might have had an influence.
"Beautiful this afternoon, basically same experience as I wrote about yesterday.Nathan Fletcher said something the other day that makes so much sense. Something to the tune of, the risk isnt going away as we begin to open things up, but we are doing things differently than we were in January and February, to help mitigate the risk. By washing our hands more frequently, not touching our faces, keeping distance from others etc.I feel like there are a lot of people that think if you walk by someone with Covid that they will automatically get covid. That isnt exactly how it works."
This push to open places for recreation and business is understandable but people ought to look at the history of the Spanish Flu pandemic. It went on for two years because people kept opening up places and the virus came roaring back.
Darwin at work.
"spap, The Spanish Flu Death Rate was MUCH higher then the Death Rate of Covid-19."

"Liars , I’m so sad about this. My afternoon walks while my husband surfed kept me sane. I’m hoping when the final statement comes out it’s not as bad as it sounds. Wishful thinking? I think closing all California beaches from 11-5 would be enough. When we had that ordinance you could still cross the sand any time of day to surf, just no walking during that time."
"The beach re closures do not effect SD beaches.‘Great news: the Governor heard us. San Diego beaches WILL STAY OPEN under our plan approved by lifeguards and health officials. In a time of great crisis we don't need knee-jerk policies. We need to keep a steady hand. It’s the only way to keep the public’s trust. Keep it up, SD!"" Mayor Kevin Faulconer tweeted after Newsom announced that he would close Orange County beaches only.’https:/…3famp"
"#75. Probably not even worthwhile to respond to nonsense but ""Figures don't lie, but liars figure.""I won't respond further to his babble."
I think the protests again the State being Shutdown are going to start to gain more and more momentum. I have a feeling this is going to be very interesting time in history.
Thank you Mayor Faulkner!!
Well expect all of Orange County and perhaps further north at SD county beaches. If only one area is open that’s where people will flock to. Yet in Marin there are signs within 1-2 miles of trail heads and open space that cars parked on the street will have their registrations checked and if that vehicle is not registered to THAT street it will be towed. And I’ve seen the sheriff checking.
"The difference between OC and SD, is that Newport and HB allowed ""lounging"", had they only allowed exercising things would be different."
"But my point is if OC beaches close, people from OC will be in SD in a heartbeat. Add a million more people to SD beaches. How socially distance can that be?BTW, are Del Mar and Solana Beach beaches still closed?"
">>BTW, are Del Mar and Solana Beach beaches still closed?<<Havent heard, they were going to open, and then the news of Newsom's deal last night caused Del Mar to not open this morning as planned, so not sure where they stand now,If everything would open to excercise only, every beach would be less crowded. I like Coronado because it never feels crowded even on a hot summer day during non-covid times, nice wide beach. Some place like La Jolla Shores feels crowded even when there arent a ton of people there, beach is not very wide.Edited: 7:22 pm, April 30, 2020 "
"The point is also that there are still stay at home orders. People just coming to the beach for whatever should not be. It's not essential. Walk your dog, surf, jog, enjoy a stroll then go back home. Hopefully, OC goes to invade LA County and spares us. The beaches were ""opened"" for exercise not stagnating. Stagnating and flaunting is clearly what happened last weekend in OC without social distancing or respect for others. It's been going pretty good in my area pb/mb. I'd like to see it progress to the next phase.Edited: 10:01 pm, April 30, 2020 "
">> BTW, are Del Mar and Solana Beach beaches still closed?Solana Beach was not planning to reopen until next week anyway, so I assume they're still on track. I haven't heard anything new about Del Mar, but I wouldn't be surprised if they adopt Solana Beach's timetable.>> But my point is if OC beaches close, people from OC will be in SD in a heartbeat.I expect Oceanside and Carlsbad will get some people, but with all the parking lots and a lot of street parking closed, and Camp Pendleton creating a separation between the two counties that makes them seem farther apart than they really are, I'm hoping it won't be too bad. The May Gray weather pattern has also arrived early and it's a lot cooler than it was last weekend, so that may help to suppress the crowds a bit too."
Well just hope San Diego doesn't see what Jacksonville saw a week or so ago. Everyone flocked to those beaches .. which also did not allow towels or lounging. I continue to wonder WHY Southern California has so many more cases and deaths than Northern California. And is still much more active for new infections. While SF is the second densest city (of more than a few hundred thousand) after NYC. And we have fewer than 1500 cases and 22 deaths. As #88 indicates ... Stay at Home order is still in affect.
"Went to Coronado for an hour walk on the beach today everyone doing what they should be, same as earlier in the week. This weekend will be the test.>>I continue to wonder WHY Southern California has so many more cases and deaths than Northern California. <<I dont know what the numbers are in Northen CA, but OC and SD Counties are low, LA County is definitely higher."
">>>I continue to wonder WHY Southern California has so many more cases and deaths than Northern California. And is still much more active for new infections.<<<It isn't ""Southern California"". It isn't even LA County, it is the City of Los Angeles that us having issues.Orange County is more than 3x the population of SF County, but doesn't have 3x the cases or deaths. Santa Clara Co, Alameda Co and San Mateo Co all have higher infection rates than OC based on population."
"My earlier post summed up what happened here in Orange County - with the LA beaches closed, there was an extra influx not normally seen. Usually we get the crowds from the IE, but last weekend it was from all sides. I'm sure there were areas that were overcrowded, but from what we saw (went for a bike ride north of HB Pier) everybody looked to be respecting the rules. Some of the media's camera angles are deceiving, making it look like people were on top of each other, while the overhead shots showed how far apart groups were.All I can say is maybe you can close down the 15 fwy this weekend..."
"SFs numbers per capita are way below any SoCal county. And that’s all car country! While SF has (or had) a very robust public transit system. Not just Muni but BART too. And, as I said above, SF is a much more densely populated place than anywhere in the state. (Second after NYC of major cities.)And most NorCal counties are similar. It’s not just LA. Check out Riverside. Even San Diego."
"SD County Population 3.38 Million 124 Covid DeathsSanta Clara County Pop. 1.9 million 111 DeathsSan Mateo County Pop. 727K 51 DeathsSF County Pop. 883K 28 DeathsAlameda County Pop.1.6 million 60 DeathsJust comparing a few Bay Area Counties, SF County death rate is very low, as you point almost unbelievable given the density. Orange County has a low death rate too with 45 (3.16 pop)The other Bay area counties along the peninsula and across the bay are closer to SD or higher than SD per capita deaths. Futher North as the counties in the Bay become more rural the numbers drop which Id expect so maybe not good comparison to SD County."
Santa Clara’s numbers aren’t great. That’s why we would like them to stop coming over like it’s summer vacation. Man they get pissed about that. Some of them anyway. Sorry you didn’t choose to live near a beach. You can visit when this is all over.
>>>SFs numbers per capita are way below any SoCal county.<<<Nope.SF's infection rate is .0017. Orange County is .0008.
Glad to see San Diegans overwhelmingly good citizens.
"""Sorry you didn't choose to live near a beach.""That's really breathtaking. I assume you're talking to a family of five with two breadwinners at minimum wage. Right, not getting to visit the beach is a ""bad lifestyle choice."""
"<< That's really breathtaking. I assume you're talking to a family of five with two breadwinners at minimum wage. Right, not getting to visit the beach is a ""bad lifestyle choice."">>Sorry I don’t think you get this at all. This isn’t a class thing. You are perfectly welcome to travel to the beach and visit when California isn’t under a state of emergency and you’re not supposed to travel from your immediate area unless it essential business. I’m not mad that 10 minutes from me someone can walk out their backdoor and be on the sand, while I either have to walk 10 minutes down a busy street or drive 4 minutes and try to park now that all our beach parking is closed. Even within 10 minutes to the beach there are inequities. I can’t afford the $4,000,000 house on the sand but I’m not mad at the person who can. Even in my town I can only go to the beach before 11 am or after 5. You see we’re all making adjustments.Edited: 5:35 am, May 03, 2020 "
">>That's really breathtaking. I assume you're talking to a family of five with two breadwinners at minimum wage. Right, not getting to visit the beach is a ""bad lifestyle choice.""<<The bad lifestyle choice is choosing to believe that you have the right to break quarantine and travel a distance to go to a beach. Just as it is when rich people choose to shelter-in-place in a gazillion $ mansion hours from their actual home.  It's irresponsible; the family's financial situation is irrelevant.Edited: 5:58 am, May 03, 2020 "

"Stop representing yourself as a working class family eking out a living. Per your travel map, you have been to a lot of places.Staying at home to help control and deadly pandemic is hardly that onerous."
"""Staying at home to help control and deadly pandemic is hardly that onerous.""For a lot of people without the savings to sit it out, it is very onerous. And the pandemic isn't nearly as deadly as the always sensationalizing media originally hyped it to be."
">>>That's really breathtaking. I assume you're talking to a family of five with two breadwinners at minimum wage. Right, not getting to visit the beach is a ""bad lifestyle choice.""<<<We are in the middle of a global pandemic. Life and death. Somehow, the beach is not essential. We are staying at home in order not to overwhelm the health care system and to keep our health care workers safe. Not to mention grocery workers, postal employees, garbage workers and all those others who have to be out -- risking their health and the health of their families so that we can shelter at home. AND our curve is more at the plateau than on the downside of the curve. Why do anything that might blow that curve upwards again? Further to another comment about rate of transmission. We aren't doing enough testing anywhere in this state to have any idea what the true rate is."
"Ooh, touched a nerve. Of course I'm not that working-class family--but what if I were? And no, I'm obeying the orders and staying in my comfy home in Redlands, the Jewel of the Inland Empire."" I just can't believe how tone-deaf some people are, You have the great good fortune to live in desirable places, but you don't want to share. I'm pretty sure you resent all those grubby inlanders all the time--it's just now you can say it. You might also think about the effect of all those germ-ridden visitor dollars on your economy. I'm done with this. Feel free to continue your little party."
"Oh no you didn’t touch a nerve, you just proved a point that some people are clueless as to what this all about. No one is discriminating against inlanders. You just seem really p. o’d about they whole thing. People on the coast didn’t write the rules. We’re living with them too.  People in my own county don’t want people that live a mile from the ocean going to the beach. It’s all relative. I’m writing this from my backyard because I can’t go the beach until 5 without getting a fine. I’m not upset. Everyone’s economy is bad right now. We’re keeping our restaurants going the best we can. A new Michelin Star chef opened at the beginning of the shut down near my house. It takes over a 100 calls to get through to order an overpriced pizza and they sell out everyday by 3. We’re doing ok.Wouldn’t people that live inland be serving their communities more if they spent their money at home?Edited: 5:05 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Not everyone gets to live by the beach, and that doesn't mean those who do or do not ought to bash each other. For every coast resident who is afraid that inlanders will flock in and bring infection, there is an inlander in a hot, humid place craving fresh air and wishing the coastals weren’t so inhospitable; and for every inlander who has cabin fever and really longs for a day at the beach, there is a coastal who is worried about the crowds and wishes the inlanders weren’t so clueless. Everyone who lives either near the beach or in the middle of the inland has an elderly grandma or uncle or knows a vulnerable person and worries they will die if they get sick, and also knows someone who has been laid off or had to close their business and is now having trouble paying bills.Empathy is being able to imagine ourselves in someone else’s skin. It isn’t something politicians of most brands have been showing much of, but it is usually part of the average normal human’s makeup. Even in a crisis, and hopefully especially during a crisis. Remember President Bush II, the one who tried to buoy us up and unite us as a national community after 9/11? If you’re too young to remember 9/11 (sheesh, I recall people saying that about Pearl Harbor and the Nuremburg trials when I was little, and then later saying similar things myself to younger people about November 22 or Loma Prieta), this is what he told us on the night of 9/11: https:/…He was an imperfect President, like all of them have been. He made mistakes after 9/11, and he didn’t always take the best advice or make good decisions, but I believe his heart was in the right place and he wanted the best for us and hoped to bring people together. I wish I could say the same about some of our politicians today, from whom we have been seeing irresponsibility, partisanship, hostility, and self-absorption – anything but the unity, community, compassion, and wisdom we need so much. I think Mr. Bush would agree with me, because he had a message for all of us today: https:/…gwbush911addresstothenation.htm"
"Back to the matter of comparing infection and death rates for counties – don’t forget the differences in population density. Every county except San Francisco has rural areas, including those we usually think of as “urban” like San Mateo or Santa Clara. There are rural parts of Los Angeles County, as well as Alameda and Contra Costa. San Francisco is a combined city and county of 49 square miles that share the same boundaries. It has a higher density than any U.S. city except New York. The average population density here is 18,000 per square mile, but that average has to account for areas with huge differences in density: Seacliff and the Mission, St. Francis Wood and Chinatown, Presidio Terrace and the Tenderloin, for instance. And don’t forget all the parks, from the neighborhood ones of one to four square blocks up to the biggies, the Presidio, Golden Gate, McLaren, Glen Canyon, Stern Grove, the Zoo, and Lake Merced. That means some neighborhoods of mansions and huge lots might average 8,000 bodies per square mile while others are pushing 25,000. Indeed, the biggest clusters in San Francisco have been at homeless shelters where, if you projected the area into square miles, the square mile density could work to 45,000 or 50,000; other areas have had cases, but not “outbreaks.”Another pretty impressive thing is how Laguna Honda Hospital has done. It’s the City’s home for elderly or permanently disabled people with nowhere else to go, and it’s a real medical institution, not one of those sad warehouses that are in the news for losing scores of people. It has about 750 resident patients. They had several cases in March, mostly staff. The Health Dept. moved fast and quarantined it more than a week before the Bay Area shelter-in-place order, which preceded the state by a couple of days: no visitors in, no patients out, and any patient who left could not return while the order was in effect. The last report I saw on cases there was maybe 5 days ago, and they had a total of 21, only 5 of them patients, and no deaths. This, in a place with hundreds of really frail people where you would worry most about contagion spreading like wildfire. Something has been done right at Laguna Honda, and I guess time will tell what that is. Let’s hope it stays this way. But is it a lesson for the rest of us, that strict, absolute control of people’s movement is how to contain the infection? I hate to think that adults need to be told to be responsible and give a rat’s YKW about not only their health but their neighbors’ too, because freedom of movement is one of our great American values. But so is responsibility – or at least it was. California residents have been given the chance to test their commitment to freedom with responsibility and thousands have flunked."
"Took a drive out to Coronado and had a nice afternoon staring at DT from Centennial Park. Gorgeous bay views on a clear sunny vibrant warm day. Lots of folks picnicking and enjoying their day in the park. Looked like any other day on the island though with lesser amounts of people and businesses closed. Lots of people of all ages out and about cycling, rollerblading, a handful of children wading in the shorebreak, lots of boaters, kayakers, and SUPB’s. Most people NOT wearing masks. On the south side parking is prohibited on Ocean Blvd with signs lining the streets however still lots of folks walking, cycling, and just generally enjoying the day.Police sign displayed beach’s there open from 6am-6pm.Edited: 7:30 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Washing your hands and not touching your face gives you ZERO protection against aerosolized particles in the air that you inhale through your nose and mouth (without touching them) or into your eyes.Hand washing helps prevent virus transmission in about 10-12% of cases (if done 12-15 times a day; hand sanitizer is less effective). Beaches are not known for their availability of soap - bring your own. DO not bring soap that harms the environment.If you are worried (and you have a right to be), stay 10 feet or more from people when you can.If you're medically fragile (including being above 30 in BMI), wear a mask and some wrap around sunglasses. Stay away from strangers."

"Carlsbad, Solana Beach, and Del Mar re-opened their city beaches on Monday, and the state re-opened Carlsbad and Torrey Pines. Parking lots still closed. We live really close to Torrey Pines but will respect stay at home and not go there."
"The more beaches that are open, the less crowded any of those will (should) be, As soon as I finish up some work things, Im going to hit the sand at Coronado for some excersice and enjoy the beautiful day."
"Comments about punctuation or spelling are not really helpful or travel related!We will try to go to La Jolla Shores this morning but will only stay if not crowded. I heard from friends that Torrey Pines road near the state beach was a total traffic jam Sunday night with folks wanting to see the luminescence in the ocean. I have no desire to be out and about in traffic!,"
"Riff, did you make it to La Jolla Shores? If so, was it crowded? Sounds like the folks in SD County are doing a great job of following the rules and are being rewarded because of this!"
"Just got back from La Jolla Shores this morning. Parking lots and walkway closed. We parked 2 blocks from the park. It was not crowded at all. No sitting on the sand Kids were playing. Folks were walking,running,surfing and jumping in the waves. I thought most were wearing masks. Mr Riff thought many werenot wearing them. We were ours. Lots of young moms were out with little ones and they were standing and chatting while watching their kiddos. I was sad to hear the description of the park in Coronado where folks were sitting on the ground and not wearing masks so glad we didn't go there. We are following social distancing and masks in public areas and would hope that others would do the same to keep us all safe!!Edited: 3:54 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"Sitting and picnicking is allowed in the open parks in Coronado as long as you're more than 6 feet from anyone you don't live with. No sitting allowed on the beach though, and Sunset and Tidelands parks are still closed."
">>Sitting and picnicking is allowed in the open parks in Coronado as long as you're more than 6 feet from anyone you don't live with.<<And a mask is not required in that situation either. I wear a mask out but dont have it on outside if Im not 6 feet from people when Im exercising. Most that I see are doing that as well, so runners/walkers do have masks on but most I see have them around their necks and if needed pull them up as required.Edited: 4:14 pm, May 07, 2020 "
I didn't say folks should wear masks while they are running or walking away from others. My comment was just that the description of the park in Coronado didn't sound safe for me! Whether or not picnicking is allowed there is really unimportant. Once it is allowed there is no way to know if they are family groups or just friends hanging out. Once folks are that comfy then I have no way to know if they are being careful in other ways and I have no desire to be out and about with them! It is my decision and that's all I said. I felt safe at La Jolla Shores. I have no desire to go to Coronado if the rules are more relaxed there
"Per the news, folks living in Sunset Cliffs are really, really pissed off at the crowds there at night partying, littering, disrupting, and they are trying to get the police to get rid of the rowdies at night and into early morning. So, it is not entirely wonderful to live with a view. Hope the mayor and police get these outsiders out of there.....bioluminescence or no."
