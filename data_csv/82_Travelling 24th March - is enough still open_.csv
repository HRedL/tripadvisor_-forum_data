"Hi,Me and my girlfriend are travelling to Budapest for 4days on 24th March. I know Hungary is currently safer than back home with regards to COVID-19, but im concerned about enough things being open. Ive read today about libraries and museums being closed, of which of planned to visit.Should this also affect other key tourist locations? What about bars and restaurants?
