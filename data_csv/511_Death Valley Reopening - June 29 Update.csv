I wonder how long until they walk that back. Of course it is a national park so health and safety warnings/regulations will follow later or rather too late.
"Individual parks have a lot of latitude to design their reopening plans, and park management in Death Valley has largely been following California state guidelines"
"National Parks are taking their cues from the adjacent counties. As they should. If counties make course corrections neighboring NPs will do the same.Regardless your opinion of a county’s opening, the NP needs to work with those counties.Not to mention that DV in summer isn’t exactly a Covid hotspot.Edited: 9:28 pm, June 29, 2020 "
Wonder how long it will be till a national park visitor will come down with a covid-19 infection.
Thanks Frisco_roadrunner. I saw the fb post with the info on the bad behavior and rescues already needed. Sad people can't just enjoy and not destroy and endanger others.
Yep. Many ways to die in Death Valley. Wish those people who have a choice would stay home and stop the madness.
"LOL many ways to die in DV! Not. Very few do.Yes stop the madness and don't shut the park back down or I'm going to riot! You know, yes there have been accidents in the parks recently. But to me, that's normal life. Accidents happen even if they are stupid and take resources. They happen yearly at the parks. So do auto accidents which happen all the time.Death Valley is a very safe place to visit during the COVID. So much space. The campgrounds are very safe with spaced out sites. So many places have so much room. Easy to distance.I don't plan on going anywhere inside during our late October trailer camping trip except perhaps the wide open new store. Might sit outside at the ranch or on the deck again at Panamint Springs. Don't know how we are going to get a date shake at China Date Ranch as I'm not going into that little space, even with mask on. Maybe they will have a outside service for that."
