"Folks, we are in this for the long haul. I’d be shocked if Vegas is open before June. In fact if it opens before that I think it’s quite the risk. How long will it be more normal? Maybe July to September if we can get things going by June. The thing everybody needs to remember is we need to really slow the curve of this thing,"
Open by June? Perhaps...fully operational and back to pre virus days? No
I hit on that by saying back to more normal.

I cancelled my September trip. We were also suppose to go to Hawaii in May so that’s cancelled too. Even if the plane goes I’d rather put my health first. We will all probably get this virus but I’d rather do it closer to a cure which is roughly a year or more out.
The only sure thing is that there is no sure thing.
"Seniors, I think most anyway, will stay away for many months."
You're right that we're in this for the long haul. But June is hardly long haul.
"In the media yesterday, POTUS wanted it to be only another 15 days of lockdown. Today, he tweeted, crossed out the 15 days and changed it to 8 days.China is reporting new cases of coronavirus, so it will be around for some time. Some normality needs to be restored until a vaccine is available."
"Canada and the US are so far behind China in trying to get this virus under control...it's scary! It's gonna get so much worse before it gets better. Just an example...all those spring breakers on the beaches in Florida, many who are starting to test positive for Covid-19. Wait till they ALL return home...do you really think they're going to self isolate themselves for 2 weeks when they can't even social distance themselves on a beach? I was really hoping to be going to Vegas at the end of May (or June) but it's starting to look doubtful...fingers crossed though!Hopefully we can ALL get it together and get this virus under control."
A guy in Wuhan ate a bat in November 2019 and now we can’t go to Vegas.
"At the present stage, my trip due up a little beyond 4 wks. from now, I'll most likely windup cancelling it. Once I do cancel it, I'll just plan by booking my next scheduled Vegas trip against the earlier part of Oct. Come the summertime months however, I'll be doing a few 4-nt. weekender trips (booked months ago) to Atlantic City. And should the current situation fail to greatly improve come each one's arrival, I'll just have to cancel them as well.Posted: Wanted Dead, but not alive; this deadly &/or vicious outlaw known as the Coronavirus."
Maybe Vegas will be open for business much sooner than we think. POTUS is now talking about not letting the cure create a worse problem than the virus. Perhaps he's thinking of lifting all restrictions and just letting the virus run its course? Mmmm...
"Were Trump to get his wish and we go back to ""normal"" in 8 days that only means in about 3-4 weeks we'll be doing this again only we'll be in far far worse shape than we are now. The only way to get back to normal now and to minimize the already devastating economic impact is to stay the course.Not shocking that after only about a week Trump lost his will and is panicking. It's actually kind of embarrassing regardless of your political persuasion. World leaders everywhere, be it on the left or right, are stepping up and doing what is required of them. Except ours, who is acting like a timid frightened child and having a temper tantrum.Edited: 8:52 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"I don't think it matters what POS thinks, the state and county have to fall inline as well. They seem committed to at least the mid-April mark for the state, but after that anybody's guess. If they could somehow mitigate the sick with proper supplies or a drug that positively helps with recovery there would be a chance. If not we are just stuck waiting it out but folks will not be that patient must likely. I think what people don't seem to get in the flatten the curve model it's still same amount infected( correct me if I'm wrong). It's just spread out months instead of weeks and the capacity to handle it which reduces the deaths. But the virus is here to stay now. Wash your hands and best to all."
I've seen enough evidence to suggest the summer months are going to see a massive slowdown in new cases. It will look almost like its in check at times and hence the country and of course Vegas will be open for business. But its going to need to be in a modified way because these same experts are adamant a second wave is coming in the late Fall. We need to face reality nothing will be normal for the next year but if we make the hard sacrifices now it doesn't need always be as evasive as this.
Planning Vegas 2021.
I still haven't canceled my mid-may trip still have my fingers crossed. I would be okay if everything isn't open as long as the hotel and the pools are open.
Does OP mean June 2021?
I'm still booked for June. They are currently taking reservations for May.

""" My bet is, the casinos will not reopen till October 2021.""I know there still are people who deny how serious this is, but I'm more than willing to put up $100 that says you're wrong. Let me know whenever you travel there so I can collect."
"Hey Blue at least you're taking it seriously. I think among the last of the deniers is somebody from Michigan which is on the verge of seeing too many cases versus not enough hospital beds. But to him, this is ""just like the flu."""
I am hoping it will be open by this June. Originally scheduled to be there now and rescheduled for June. I know some feel everything will be shut down for a long time. I don’t see that happening or we will have a lot more problems then Covid19. People will stay in for a short period of time but I don’t see everyone to stop living for that long. Time will tell.
"“ I think among the last of the deniers is somebody from Michigan which is on the verge of seeing too many cases versus not enough hospital beds. But to him, this is ""just like the flu.""”I thought “ flu guy” was from Wisconsin. I’m open to correction if I’m thinking of the wrong person."
"I won’t go until there is a vaccine. So will be cancelling my July, August and November trips this year. I have asthma so am overly concerned about catching coved-19."
"If this actually gets as bad as they say, why can’t LVhttps:/…20200325200808-oc1ie"
FLW...source? Just kidding trump will have everything open in 2 weeks.
"Here you go, it's even from Fox News:""Henry Ford Health reaches capacity at 2 hospitals for COVID-19 patients""https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/henry-ford-…"
I think many people are in self denial especially trump My trip from the UK in November is iffy and that's 50 50 This virus is a killer and highly contagious. .things will only resemble any normality when there is a vaccine readily available The trouble with lifting sanctions on movement etc is that this virus will hit again.Looking from afar it seems trumps more interested in the dollar than saving lives.He will be the death of your nation...this is all being led by science. .I suggests he just follows their advice and not his business head...they're the experts not him.Very dissapointed in his flippancy in treating this as just a flu like problem.The speed of getting a vaccine globally will determine normality for the world and not stupid crazy predictions like it'll be fine by June .Ain't going to happen I'm afraid
"We're looking at September as a possible date to visit.Obviously we won't be booking it yet whilst the situation is so volatile. We'll wait till after Easter, when everything is back to normal.then do it!CheersDavy !!!"
"Irish and FLW. I am from Wisconsin. lol Actually,I dont mind you using my Forum title. Everybody is entitled to their own opinions. At least they are for the most part. At any rate,thus far the deaths are at approx. 20,000 world-wide. Not much more then the US deaths of the common flu virus in the states. Last I heard,Denmark was letting it run its course,on the belief that immunity will lessen the blow. Time will tell on that method. If someone says that next year,a virus will kill 20,000 people in the US alone,will we behave the way we are now? Because that will be the common flu virus we get every year. And this is with available immunizations. Its interesting to see how this progresses ans how it will end. It will never end,but when will we have to accept it and move on."
But stationing 1000 troops on the US side of the Can/US border is sure to help. I would imagine we will give this year a miss. It’s fun to hope though.
I haven't canceled my May trip yet but I plan too. JetBlue has changed my flight a few times in the last week. I'm kinda waiting to see if they cancel since I booked a package and what if the hotels are still shut down? As much as I'd like to rebook for the Fall... I don't think I will. I'm thinking no Vegas in 2020 for me. First time in 17 years I'll have skipped a year. : (
"As it stands now I am looking at July thru September, if it gets pushed out further then I won’t go until pool season 2021. I absolutely am not going to base my travel and life around vaccine availability. There just is no guarantees with that, but I get being cautious with underlying conditions."
Booked Southwest with points ($45 each way) for the end of May. Booked at Bally’s all comp’d. Worst case cancel it all for zero cost. Weather should be 80-90’s and can’t wait.
"TJP is lost... completely clueless to the facts ..,must have gotten her /his medical degree fromTrump University"
"Hopefully , late summer up and running to some degree..."
How would a Vegas trip be fun if they limit the hotel to just guests and have limited seats and reservations in order to follow social and physical distancing?Seems boring to me with 4 people at a craps table.
"Couldn’t agree more , CO....may as well play online"
I’m perfectly fine at a craps table with four people as opposed to elbow to elbow.
"""How would a Vegas trip be fun if they limit the hotel to just guests and have limited seats and reservations in order to follow social and physical distancing?""I'd love it!! My next reservation is at Wynn and as long as the restaurants AND pools are open, I'd be happy with social distancing and limiting the hotel to just guests. :)"
"I know each has an opinion. H1N1 or the Swine flu does anyone know the totals of that Virus?????According to CDC, 57 million Americans contracted H1N1. Of those 57 million, 257,000 were hospitalized and 11,690 died of which 1,180 were children.We did not close a thing during this time nor did we shut down the vast majority of the US economy"
"end of May , looking forward to my trip to Vegas"
To clarify based on a busy Saturday night. A restaurant wait would be 6 hours based on even only 50 people in one secluded area including staff. Every bank of 3-4 slots would be limited to one person. It would be like Disneyland with lineups.
"Swine Flu did result in hundreds of school's being closed. It was bad. Our economy was hurt by it. But thankfully it's mortality rate was 0.2%. Thankfully the vast majority of hospitalizations didn't require respiratory assistance. Thankfully the R naught, the measure of how contagious it is was 1.5, which kept the spread on a slower even pace. Again it was bad, real bad. Thankfully it wasn't worse.Covid's mortality rate is unknown, adequate medical care will be a huge factor. But it still is 8 to 40 times worse than Swine Flu. Unfortunately respiratory assistance is vital to those hospitalized, respirators and ventilators are critical. Even a similar number of hospitalizations as Swine Flu, 279,000, would create a problem.But the biggest problem is the dreaded R naught. It's estimated at around 3. The difference is massive. Anything over 2 means exponential growth, meaning it spreads too far and too fast for ordinary mitigation efforts to work. It threatens to simply overrun our health car system. That'll be the difference between a 2% mortality rate and an 8% one.There's so much more Lance they're learning. Twenty percent of all symptomatic patients may be facing some degree of permanent respiratory damage. Get used to the term Coronavirus Emphysema. They are still calculating the shortened life expediencies of those who were critically ill yet survived. So yeah Lance, the Swine Flu was bad yet we didn't shut everything down. There's a reason why we did for this.Edited: 12:13 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Blue, I hope your optimism proves correct! But I'd hold off. We're in a lull. All the hard to believe insanity that was locking down is passed. But in the next 2-4 weeks is when the virus's actual affects will begun to be felt. Already in NY, Michigan, and now Louisiana the hospitals are getting filled up, most of the country will be joining them. It will be a grim reminder why we're doing this in the first place."
"Ha! That's quite a swing in perspectives!The reality is that nobody knows and they won't for a while yet. They need more information. Thankfully testing is starting to provide it. The 10-14 day incubation period means data gathering is gonna be a slow process. My guess is mid-April. No, not when restrictions are lifted, but when experts will have enough information where longer term planning is possible."
"Blue...if casinos are still closed by October 2021, then we are REALLY screwed!!I'm still hoping for the end of May...fingers crossed!! :)(and by May, I mean May 2020!)Edited: 12:44 am, March 27, 2020 "
"@Blue... A recent David Mckee's Stiffs and Georges blog article indicated that fixed costs per day ( before they earn a dime of revenue, just the daily cost of not doing business while shut down) is..MGM = $13M/ per dayLas Vegas Sands ( Venetian / Palazzo) = $7.5M per dayWynn = $5M per dayBoyd Gaming = $2MStation Casinos = $1MNo figures reported for CET...and I don't know , nor does he quote other than a JP Morgan analyst, the source of those figures; he might know a guy or 2, or something.https:/…the-cost-of-not-doing-business"
"""I know each has an opinion. H1N1 or the Swine flu does anyone know the totals of that Virus?????According to CDC, 57 million Americans contracted H1N1.

The numbers of those who died from H1N1 were .02% of those who contracted the disease. Compare this to the common flu which is .1% and then to the coronavirus with a much deadlier rate of at least 1% and I hope you can answer your own question."
FLW all you did was make more examples of the completely unknown. Comparing H1N1 and the flu to covid which is completely unknown at this time in the US as it has more cases than China with a far less dense population.
"Please CO, we all know China’s numbers are pure fabrication."
Source on that TKC?
"Come on man, you’re smarter than that. The first case dates back to mid November, What we know about covid19 and the dense population there. It’s just no way."
Ok so no source just speculation on your part. I just wanted to clarify.
And there hasnt been nearly enough testing yet to even begin to speculate what the percentage of death will be with this virus.
I have a trip booked for September and cannot wait!!
Which June are you meaning? 2021?2022?Because it won't be 2020
Open to American residents July with restrictions Open to international visitors with proof of already having tge virus ..September Back to total normality once vaccine available ..because they can't trust another outbreak Probably be a good year
"I had mid June booked but it is looking like a no go. So booked for the end of August, fingers crossed"
Just booked both hotel & airfare against the very end of Sept. to the earlier part of Oct.
"There is nothing stopping anyone from going to Vegas today, tomorrow or May. Granted the casinos are closed and it’s is about the same as any other town in America. But there are hotels open with pools, take out available and groceries. Not saying it’s the right thing to do, but Vegas is still there people. And stop with this 2021 thing. If it is that long, Vegas is the least of anyone’s problem.Edited: 5:21 pm, March 28, 2020 "
I'm planning May. Plan whenever you want.
booked trip May 19th thru the 22nd keeping my fingers crossed
Still wouldn’t fly for free this year.
"ooooh Blue, sounds like you have a fabulous trip planned!"
Partially..November Fully ..new year
Open by June ..cloud cuckoo land Im afraid
"Johnson and Johnson just announced they want to fast track a vaccine based on their Ebola vaccine. There are two others in the works. Could also have some anti-viral drugs that would at least give the higher risk folks better odds of staying out of the ICU.Need quick tests available everywhere. Also need a reliable and fast test for antibodies to see just how many people might have actually had the virus to determine a possible herd immunity percentage. Until those things happen, mass gatherings will likely remain locked down. If we get an anti-viral drug that does ""OK,"" I predict an ease on certain restrictions. Dine in restaurants can only do half occupancy, government offices back open but with various restrictions and precautions. If it works pretty well, then they will likely limit supply to those who are high risk and just open everything back up full swing. Those with high risk factors would get the script from their doctor. Those who just don't feel good but seem to have OK breathing will be watched, and that should help build the herd immunity, which hopefully will be of a decent length."
"""And there hasnt been nearly enough testing yet to even begin to speculate what the percentage of death will be with this virus.""Exactly. These numbers of 2%, 3%, 1%, etc. being the death rate are pointless right now. They are based off of who has been tested, not all that may have had it. Numerous people will have had this, self quarantined, got better, and not have been in the statistics.Until this has run its course, and WAY more tests have been ran, we will not know the true percentage of the death rate."
Im still booked for June but Im just waiting that jetblue put my dates so I can cancel. Might be going in November thats the other month I can take vacations.
Still hoping for June. See the attached projections.https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections
"The current Delta policy isn't that an e-credit can be used ""anytime."" They've already updated their policy for tickets booked from March 1st to April 15th. Current policy states, ""New Ticket Must Be Re-issued On/Before: March 12, 2021"" and ""Rebooked Travel Must Begin No Later Than:  March 12, 2021""It will be interesting to see if LV can bounce back. I've considered LV as a possible place to relocate to. Everything I've read said the city is expanding their base. They've got the pro-sports teams. A lot of people are moving there because housing is just too costly in CA, OR, and WA states. In the end, if all the gaming companies go bankrupt, the casinos get sold to the highest bidder. If the properties were sold for a lower amount, it is possible that the costs associated with the city could go down. This would help draw back business that got fed up with over priced drinks, over priced food, etc. etc.."
"MGM, Sands, and WynnCore aren’t going out of business."
if the report is correct that MGM is losing 13 million a day in lost income that means since the time of closure until the end of May would result in a loss of just under one billion dollars...tough to keep all there casinos going even after they are allowed to open.
Don't cryDon't raise your eyeIt's only vacay wasteland
"If social distancing continues once the fake all clear whistle on 4/30 blows, LV will suffer for quite awhile . Shows, restaurants make up a majority of hotel/casino revenues, and social distancing will cause them to limit attendance... Still better then nothing , but will cause financial hardships for many former employees, who will be furloughed, or employed in a PT role..."
Nancy Pelosi was just on CNBC. She implied 16 more weeks to beat the virus. I hope she is wrongForget June
"Nothing fake about it. My trip in August is suspect. Just like the financial meltdown in 2008 most of the casinos will have to restructure their debt and increase the resort fees, parking, and drinks to pay for it. It is written."
What is fantasy fest?
KC..... Fantasy Fest is about a 10 day street party in Key West. Definitely not a child friendly time in Key West.... I used to drive down from Palm Beach to it in my younger days.
Sounds interesting
"Blue,Sounds like the time we stayed at the Hilton LAX, for an overnight connection. Just so happens that the hotel was hosting Dom-Con.That was something to behold.Hunt"

"I have been following what has been happening in Macau and it's not good. Since the casinos reopened on feb 20 after a fifteen day shutdown the business has been something like 10 or 15% of what it was.JP Morgan is predicting an April with less revenue than March and close to zero. I am sure the Casino operators are looking to Macau when deciding what to do. Especially Wynn, MGM and Sands who have gotten a lot of their revenue from properties there in the past.It doesn't look good for the gaming industry."
"Macau is a different animal than Vegas. Number one, the giant elephant in the room, er panda is China itself, where the outbreak started. Travel in China is very restricted. Two, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been cracking down on transferring large sums of money out of the country for some time. While Macau is technically Chinese, it is an SAR, which means it gets special rules. Three, Macau is basically all about gambling unlike Vegas which has other things to offer. Four, foreign entry requires a 14 day quarantine which means basically no tourists. Vegas will have an ample supply from within the US. Maybe some hotels close off towers but there will be business."
"In the past, obviously not now, I have read that one of the reasons that Sands, Wynn and MGM have done better than Caesars is there presence in Macau which has been their cash cow. Macau is not exactly like Vegas but it is the only gaming destination, that I know of, we have to look at that has been shut down by the coronavirus and reopened."
