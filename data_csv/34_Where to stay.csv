"We're booked to go to Croatia in two weeks however worried they might be off the UK safe to travel countries. Italy has a very low 14 day rating and we can get flights to Naples. I love Italy and have stayed in Tuscany, cinque Terre, Rome and Florence. We love nice food and wine and walking. We alsi don't like to be right in the busy centre however won't be hiring a car so not too isolated either. I like to do my research however running out of time. Looking for recommendations for where to stay please. Do we stay in Naples if so where or head to sorrento or Amalfi coast. Please help"
"Hi! I think that the best solution could be NH panorama Naples, it s a skyscraper that has a rally nice view on the city... Maybe u could choose a B&b in the historix centre or an hotel on the seaside( lungomare Caracciolo)"
"Naples if you want a city vibe, lots to see/do, ferries to Sorrento or islands. But you might also consider Sorrento, small city with good atmosphere and travel connections (and lodging choices). Or even Capri if you just want to stay put in a beautiful spot."
"Hi Swilson, i often travel to naples, have just this week returned from Italy, Not sure how long you are going for, but a good suggestion is to spend either some time in Ischia where there are plenty of good hotels, beaches, and a real resort feel. A ferry from Naples is about an hour, From there you have conections to Procida another nearby Island. Then back to Naples for a couple of nights before flying home. We always stay on the lungomare when in Naples, lovely views of Vesuvius and the bay of Naples. Also plenty of nearby places to eat. Hotel Rex is a good chioce."
"A nice place to stay in Naples is Hotel Costantinopoli 104 - it is within the historic centre and close to restaurants, the fabulous Archaeological Museum and esayt o get around, yet, because of its location in a courtyard behind a courtyard it is pretty quiet and even has its own small swimming pool. You can take local trains to Herculaneum & Pompeii. If you are looking at two weeks, you could spend 3/4/5 nights in Naples and then head for Sorrento (possibly with a couple of nights on Capri) or visit Ischia. Ischia has plenty of options - we like the small pedestrian hamlet of Sant'Angelo.If you stay in Sorrento there are bus/ferry options to the Amalfi Coast although check first as Covid hes affected schedules:https://www.positano.com/en/ferry-schedulehttps:/…sorrento-to-positano-bus-schedulehttps:/…sorrento_buses.html.You can also visit Capri using the public ferry."
"@andmar. Thanks very much for your suggestions, the hotel in Naples looks beautiful. Do you normally stay in hotels, do you have any suggestions for accommodation in sorrento or ischia or Capri. We normally enjoy airbnb and having our own space, however if Croatia falls through, which is looking likely we're completely open to suggestions. TIA"
"We had a very nice stay at this B&B in Capri, in a very quiet, central and convenient location.https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g18…"
"On Ischia consider San Montano in Sant'Angelo or Villa Durrueli in Ischia Porto. In Sorrento, the Bristol is very good (it is a ten minute walk from the centre). Further out from Sorrento, the Relais Blu (run by younger members of the Acampora family who own the Bristol and a number of other hotels in the area) is fabulous and in normal years booked out well in advance. It is a bit more isolated though with a limited daytime bus service and nothing but expensive taxis to Sorrento in the evening unless you have a car. Some local restaurants near the Relais Blu did pick up guests for dinner but whether that continues I can't say. I haven't stayed at the other Acampora hotels but here's a link to the website. I would imagine standards are similar across the group but TA will have reviews to confirm.http://www.acamporahotels.it/On Capri, The Orsa Maggiore up in Anacapri is very nice but can suffer a little from traffic noise. More upmarket and with stunning views are La Scalinatella & Casa Morgano. I've heard good things about the more modest Gatto Bianco but never stayed there - it is just off the Piazzetta so in a prime location.I'm sorry but I have never booked anythng other than a hotel so can't recommend an apartment."
"You have not mentioned your budget but I stay at Villa Brunella on Capri - I'm not sure of this year's pricesYou can also check www.capri.net for accommodations on the islandAnacapri has more B&Bs than the Capri ""towns"" side -"

"Dublincase, what a stupid comment, If you cant contribute to the OP questions then move on. If you want to stay put forever good on you, but dont lecture others for their choice."
"Hi. Don't miss to discover the beautiful island of Ischia, rich of thermal parks, beach, hills ideals for trekking, great food, and the nearby island of Procida, a mediterranean jewel. Lots of wonderful hotels and restaurants, relax and sun."
"I totally agree Neopolitano. I visited twice last year, and thought it was wonderful, also provide, so unspoiled. Hope to be back as soon as possible, take care."
Stupid comment. Which part of my 3 sentence post is a stupid comment?
Thanks everyone for your advice. Where would be the best place to stay in Naples to catch a ferry next day to ischia
I’ve stayed at these hotels - all are walking distance from the ferry porthttps:/…https://rex-naples.hotel-naples.com/en/
