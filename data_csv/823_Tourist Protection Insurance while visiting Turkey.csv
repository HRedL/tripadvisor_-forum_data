"So we planned a late august vacation to Antalya because I just can not imagine going through the whole summer without visiting the Mediterranian and also cause turkey is one of the few destinations opening its doors to American tourists and providing many travel privileges.Anyway, I found out that there is a tourist protection and support insurance which you can apply to if you're going to be visiting any of the Turkish cities with Turkish airlines. Which honestly is really good news for anyone planning to travel this summer. If anyone has applied to this or knows more about this, I'd really appreciate if you could share."
"If you're talking about insurance offered by Turkish Airlines, then consider the policy carefully. It's probably not geared in your favour."
"If you mean the Covid-19 Support Insurance, then details are here: https://tga.gov.tr/insurance/The online application is here: https://www.covidinsurance4turkey.com/"
"Read policy carefully and keep in mind that infection rate in Turkey, while comparatively low, is I believe reported to be going up."
"Or you could just go buy insurance from an insurance company. I have a policy for upcoming trip to Mexico that covers Covid, which the fear mongers will tell you can’t do, and pretty much everything else I would need. Emergency. It’s not hard to get insurance. You just have to look for it"
I would look for a policy through insuremytrip.com
"If you catch Covid while in Turkey and in Mexico (Carol A) they will cover your costs. Wow that is some comfort. Do you really want to go to a hospital in Turkey or Mexico? You will not be allowed to fly for at least 14 days if you are allowed at all. During those 14 days you will have to self isolate. And then when you return you will have to self isolate again. And who pays when you are released from the hospital and have to self isolate? What about your travelling partner? And worst what if you really get sick like having to spend weeks and weeks in the hospital? Even if they pay, who what's that?Too complicated and full of risk for me, stay home."
"#6 Not to mention medical evacuation coverage in the event your doctors determine your medical needs could be better met elsewhere.Plus, am I correct in assuming if you decide to cancel a week before departure because of COVID situation at your destination that all your otherwise forfeitable expenses would be reimbursed?Edited: 4:57 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"Sarge, not only will they cover my cost if I catch Covid pile in Mexico they will fly me home on a medical evaluation flight. Yes I can read an insurance policy before I spend the money. Quit assuming that because you want it to be false there’s no such insuranceSince I get medical evacuation I don’t have to stay in Mexico to be treated. I will be flying home on a jet plane. Yes you can get insurance. And you can get you home if you get Covid and the airline won’t let you on the plane.I work in healthcare a long time, and I know how to read an insurance policy.Edited: 8:30 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"Wow, you mean that they would let you get on a ""jet plane"" even after it's established that you have contracted Covid and in addition you would be allowed back home. Also considering that hospitalization costs are much much more in the US than in Mexico what a deal this is. Take the coverage quick"
"So this means that in case anything happens they would cover a part of your hotel expenses while you self quarantine or hospital expenses if necessary. That being said, Turkey is probably one of the safest countries right now so I wouldn't worry too much. But it's nice to know that such insurance is available."
">>Turkey is probably one of the safest countries right now<<Ah, I think you need to do better research."
