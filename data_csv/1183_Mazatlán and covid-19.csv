We’re supposed to go to Mazatlán March 13 via Sunwing vacations. Any news about the covid-19 and Mazatlán? Trying not to get worried. Just being cautious.
I see you are new to the Mexico forum - Mazatlan isn't in Northern Mexico - here is the Mazatlan forum:  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g15079…I would repost. :)
