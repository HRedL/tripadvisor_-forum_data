"This thread reviews the hotel business background in the aftermath of COVID-19, the impact of temporary Manhattan hotel closings, the current status of reopening (subject to change), and the possible future situation. I. BACKGROUNDCOVID-19 has had a major impact on Manhattan hotels. Revenue per available room declined by almost 30% (29.1%) in the first quarter of 2020. In March, occupancy declined by almost two-thirds (63.4%) over March 2019. Different market segments had different rates of decline, but all were substantial.https:/…manhattan-lodging-index.htmlII. IMPACT OF TEMPORARY CLOSINGIn the aftermath of COVID-19, more than 30% of all TA-rated hotels--more than 120--modified their dates for accepting reservations, and some closed temporarily. Many have established full schedules since then. (Separately, two hotels, the Maxwell and the Edition Times Square, have or are about to permanently close.) III. CURRENT STATUS OF REOPENINGAs we being the second half of 2020: for July 1 and after, 40 more Manhattan hotels are now accepting reservations, and 4 additional ones will be accepting for dates July 2--July 6 and after.In addition, other Manhattan hotels are now accepting reopened (or for new hotels first-open) reservations beginning as follows (after July 6): Beginning August 1: 24 moreBeginning September 1: 12 moreFor October 1-January 1: 6 [Of these, the totals include new hotels first opening as follows:Beginning September 1: 1Beginning October 1: 3 moreBeginning November: 1 moreBeginning December:2 more]IV. THE FUTURELooking ahead, approximately 30 additional hotels are now tentatively scheduled to open in Manhattan in 2021, and about one-half dozen more in 2022-2023. The relatively large number in 2021 is attributable to delayed construction more than to construction first planned and first initiated recently. It is expected that these totals will change--that some hotels will open later and others may cease new construction, close and/or be converted to other uses The bottom line: Most Manhattan hotels with advanced reservation acceptance will have reopened by July 1. However, this does not predict rates, rate policies (such as resort fees), or the competitive structure for 2021 or beyond.While the presence of COVID-19 in Manhattan had declined very substantially and what remains continues to decline, hotel use may be impacted as much or more by other factors, such as appeal of air travel, re-opening of NYC attractions, new patterns of tele-business, and the level of appeal of the US in other countries for other reasons and thus as a travel destination. ."
Thanks for the update!
Re: post 1Jordan: thank you for your note.Little
"I just got an email from Booking.com stating that my booking for Hilton Garden Inn Times Square South (for a stay in October) has been cancelled as the hotel has ""closed"" - I've had this booking since December 2019. It seems a bit incongruent with the above information on hotels mostly reopening by July...I've made another booking somewhere else - in the off chance we will actually be allowed to travel out of our country, but gees it would be nice to know whats going on and what will/wont be open or allowable by October.Any ideas on the cancellation of, what I would have thought, would be a rock-solid hotel?"
"Well the situation is obviously fluid and hotel owners can change their minds in a matter of days - and the overwhelming majority will not update the situation until after it has occurred. None will give you a running commentary on the progress of their decision making. At this point, LittleBiff can only collate and update information that is published. As frustrating as that maybe, hotels accepting reservations - at the time of confirmation - are doing so on the *intention* of opening. Which is actually no different from hotels in bushfire/flood/cyclone prone areas every year in Australia."

"AussieBecs: I believe the HGI on E 52d St is now open. The Hilton Millennium UN Plaza, also in east midtown, is open; don't think it ever closed.On a sober note, and I'm not going to post a link because it's behind a paywall and people get mad at me when I do that, there is a story in today's ""FT Weekend"" called ""Big Reservations Among New York Hotels Over City Reopening"" that describes a grim outlook for local hotels, described by one expert interviewed as ""scary."" Another described the consequences as ""catastrophic"" if they reopen, then have to close again in the fall with a second wave of infection. It wouldn't surprise me if hotel owners decided for reasons like this not to reopen all or some of their hotels."
"AussieBecs: Also, if I were you, I would only make a reservation that was totally cancelable/refundable. I would not even consider a prepaid, nonrefundable booking at this point."
"Also, in case you are limited to Hilton properties, I am not sure but believe the Hampton Inn on E 43d St is also open."
"Of the 11 Hilton Garden Inns in Manhattan, all but ""yours""--the one on ""Times Square South""--are open or will open by July 8. The same is true for the Hampton Inns.Edited: 12:05 am, June 14, 2020 "
"""Hilton Garden Inn Times Square South (for a stay in October) has been cancelled as the hotel has ""closed"" - I've had this booking since December 2019.""Interesting as a Hilton usually doesn't do this."
“ Interesting as a Hilton usually doesn't do this.”There’s nothing “ usual” about the hotel business right now.
"Re: Posts 3 and 10.The status of the HGI Times Square SOUTH is somewhat difficult to tell: 1. It is not accepting reservations through the end of October. 2. It is accepting reservations on its site beginning November 1, but it has very high rates for an HGI property in November and December. https:/…3. Rates for the property in January are about 50% lower than the rates in November and December, and about 50% lower in February than in January.Edited: 12:56 am, June 14, 2020 "
"I think there are any number of reasons why that hotel has canceled the reservation. First, I don't know, but may not even be owned by Hilton. Second, they may have committed to have rooms available during that period under a contract with the city, a hospital, the national guard, who knows. I'm sure there are other reasons as well.One of the people interviewed in that FT article I mentioned earlier was the president of the real estate group that owns the Moxy hotels, which it sounds like are all closed -- at least the one in the East Village is boarded up. He sounded disinclined to open anytime soon. Sounded like he didn't want to damage the hip reputation their places have -- celebs, etc. -- by having the national guard stay there at a fraction of what they usually get. Guess he thought future hipsters might be put off by that.Edited: 2:21 am, June 14, 2020 "
"The Moxy East Village is currently scheduled on its website to open reservations July 1. The Moxy Chelsea and Moxy Times Square are open now. The Moxy Downtown is scheduled to open August 1.The current re-opening scheduling, subject (and likely) to change, is:By July 6: 37 hotelsBy August 1: 40 moreBy September 1: 18 moreBy October 1-December 31: 13 moreSummary (during second half of 2020): 108 Of these 108 hotels (opening or re-opening), 7 are new.Edited: 5:44 am, June 14, 2020 "
"Well if you'd read what pres of the company that owns the Moxys had to say you'd have thought they'd wait until a vaccine was found - at least at their ""hip"" oroperties."
"As QQ2 noted, I and others have not been able to access the FT Weekend article.However, on MOXY development:The fifth and final Manhattan MOXY under the current phase, the MOXY Lower East Side at 145-151 Bowery (at Broome Street) has been without estimated opening date since the site was acquired about 2 years ago and a permit was issued a little more than 1 year ago.Edited: 2:25 pm, June 14, 2020 "
Thanks for the update. Our decision to return to NY will coincide with the reopening of Broadway. Who knows when that will be?
"jgb: you’re welcome.Broadway is indeterminate now, depending on factors including financing, availability of talent, new shows (if any/many) in 2020-21, prospective box office for old shows, conversion of shows to cable, desire for domestic and international travel, and reduced frequency of in-person business transactions (and thus evening entertainment as an adjunct). Overall, a major issue will be the image of the US in the rest of the World, and whether it is viewed as hospitable and appealing.For hotels,it would not be surprising if some have further adjustments in opening dates, or do not re-open.Seven new hotels are projected to open in the second half of 2020 and about 30 in 2021 (many from 2020 delays), although it is doubtful all 37 will open, or open on time.Taken together, this gives you a strong range of competitive choice. Your patience—for Broadway and giving any new hotels at least 90 days to resolve glitches and produce reviews—may be rewarded.Edited: 3:47 pm, June 14, 2020 "
">>>First, I don't know, but may not even be owned by Hilton<<<You’re absolutely correct QQ2Hilton actually own less than 10% of their entire portfolio. Nearly half their portfolio are franchised - but usually to the ownership. That particular property has a unique arrangement, whereby it’s franchised, not to the ownership but to a management company. (Franchising is often cheaper, but there are significant drawbacks compared to having the brand company manage it. While they may get full support with Sales & Marketing, they may not get administrative support such as HR or legal, lesser discounts for staff etc)"

"Re: Post 14 (revised): By July 6, 34 additional Manhattan hotels will be accepting reservations.Edited: 3:26 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"1. Following the onset of COVID-19, the Omni Berkshire is now one of three Manhattan hotels that have since permanently closed.2. After the 34 hotel July 1 re-openings (Post 21): with further research and current hotel announcements, there will remain approximately 140 Manhattan hotels which have not re-opened for reservations. Most (not all) of these 140 have tentative re-opening dates in August and September; these dates, however, are subject to change (whether by delay, or if any of those hotels close).3. In addition to these 140 reopening hotels, there are 7 new hotels tentatively scheduled to open in Manhattan between September 1 - December 31, 2020, which schedule is subject to change.If you have further information on hotel reopenings or status, your comments will be appreciated.Edited: 11:57 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"""Following the onset of COVID-19, the Omni Berkshire is now one of three Manhattan hotels that have since permanently closed.""Surprised for an Omni Hotel."
"Good work, Little. It’s a moving target it seems with reopenings. Hopefully it settles down sooner rather than later."
OMNI closed many of their hotels entirely during the past 3 months. We were hoping to go up to Mount Washington or to New Haven and both properties were shut down. Not sure of their plans
"Out here in the wilds of Flushing, two new hotels were supposed to open, but delayed by the epidemic. One has probably the longest name for a hotel in the city: ""The Marriott Renaissance New York Flushing Hotel at Tandgram."" This will be a 4 star place with a salt water swimming pool. The other is a Hotel Indigo. Flushing hotels are popular with Asian visitors or those seeking a place close to LGA.Edited: 8:00 am, June 22, 2020 "
"Re: Post 24Aynat62. On behalf of all contributors, thank you for your gracious note.In response, and depending on the actual openings by early July, I can prepare a mid-year summary. Looking ahead: it may surprise many of us, even by then, how many hotels remain to open.Edited: 5:18 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"The Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have created a 14-day quarantine for visitors from 9 states.Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas. The quarantine begins tonight at midnight.For most if not all of these states, travel (for business or pleasure) would require at least one night lodging.A possible further implication of the quarantine is that travel to NYC from these states, or elsewhere, may be discouraged.Without overstating a possible impact: taken together, hotel investors and managers may find further challenge to re-opening decisions or dates, as well as for hotels in operation, occasioned by direct or indirect effect of the quarantine for as long as it lasts for these states if continued, or other states which may provide risks unacceptable to the Governors of the 3 states. Whatever effect this may have in the short term will be reflected and considered in the mid-year report in this thread on Manhattan hotel re-opening activity during June through July 8."
