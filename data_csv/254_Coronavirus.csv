"Hi, I’m about to travel to Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand...Any insight on the Coronavirus outbreak would be welcome from fellow travellers on the ground."
I reckon a search of all those country's forums may just yield a result. ;-)Scott
"Insights:1. Take the same precautions you would personally take when traveling to protect yourself from the flu and the common cold. There are 3-5 million cases of severe flu infections annually with 250,000 - 500,000 deaths a year, so if you're not freaking out about the flu when you travel there's no need to freak out about coronavirus.2. Be calm and enjoy your trip.Edited: 3:21 pm, February 06, 2020 "
"Luckily on the Cambodian TA forum, all posts on the subject have been contained on the 1 threads, until now of courseThe Thailand TA forum has had well over a hundreds threads on the subject, whilst the Vietnam TA forum has had probably around 40I would start your research by reading what has already been posted on the forums, and then seek professional medical advice"
"Greetings from Siem Reap, Cambodia.To date, there's only 1 known case in the country, which was in Sihanoukville. He's fully recovered. No other known cases.Still prudent to take the usual precautions one takes to prevent catching flues and colds: wash your hands frequently, especially before touching your face."
Was the infected person in Snooky Chinese perhaps ?
Yup

Is it safe to travel to Thailand Cambodia and Vietnam on March 15th?
If entering Thailand by land or air from Cambodia you will be screened for Covid-19 disease.Please see:https:/…Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad
This could complicate things for the medical authorities and those she came in to contact with/traveled with etc.https:/…Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad
"@ POST 10Now thats what I call a understatementHealth screening carried out on approx 1,450 passengers in a day and goodness knows how many crew membersYeah Right Happy Travels"
"From Ian's article... It was finally permitted to dock at the Cambodian port city of Sihanoukville on Thursday, in a move praised by World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as an example of “international solidarity”.International solidarity? Five countries turned that ship away. I bet countries that had citizens onboard that ship paid the Cambodian government to accept the ship."
"Further to posting # 10, a retest proves positive.Details here:https://www.bernama.com/en/general/news.php…Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad"
Malaysia Tightens it ban on entry- details below:https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/511044Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad
And from the Phnom Penh Post - Cambodia slowly moves to prepare for wider outbreaks. At least it is now discussing the possibility.Details here:https://www.phnompenhpost.com/opinion/time-p…Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad
"Unfortunately that article is basically an independent opinion piece. At least the paper felt safe enough to publish it but we'll see if the author isn't pursued by the government for slander, threatening social harmony, spreading rumours and fear or some other sh*te H.S. relies on to maintain (thought) control."
"Hello lennyThe Phnom Penh Post, although owned by a Malaysian tycoon, is a proxy voice piece for the Cambodian government and, as such, is virtually politically immune. It could well be that the paper is making space/preparing public/international opinion for more official announcements, just in case everything goes pear shape following the release of passengers from the cruise ship Westerdam at port of Sihanoukville; and the confirmation that one of them has tested positive twice since arrival in Malaysia. Also, a number of other ex Westerdam passengers have been denied onwards movement from Malaysia pending further testing.We will all know soon enough.Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad"
"I have a three weeks job to do in Cambodia. Most of my work will be in four provinces. With the ongoing corona virus problem, I am reconsidering if I should drop the idea going to Cambodia to do this job. Any comments would be welcomed. Thanks. Manji"
"The Westerdam passenger tested negative. The CDC said they had no record of the passenger testing positive. Indeed, the initial test did cause travel problems for Westerdam passengers. Also, travel is getting more difficult as airlines cut service and different countries put in place different restrictions.There is a recent case of a Japanese person traveling from Siem Reap via Saigon back to Japan with a fever testing positive for Coronavirus on arrival in Japan. They don't believe he got it here but could have spread it here.The virus is already pretty much everywhere in the world. There are no documented cases here after the 1 in Sihanoukville, although that could be because no tests. Unless one is elderly and/or with underlying health problems, the health risk seems to be minor. The panic and travel complications are more of a factor.I wouldn't hesitate to travel here. Take the same precautions you would to prevent catching cold or getting the flu, which is the recommendation of WHO, CDC and pretty much every other medical organization."
"Gilbert, Did you bother reading the rest of this thread?"
We don't really know how many cases are in Thailand or other countries because they lie to protect their tourist industry....
"For what it's worth my kid and two companions (UKx2, Frx1) have been turned back at the border trying to cross by bus from Cambodia to Vietnam. Now bussing it back to Phnom Penh. Whatever the advice, guidance or official policy is online, that's what's happening on the ground; the buzz on the bus beforehand was that this was likely to happen so it would appear to be slightly more than an arbitrary action by an over-zealous guard or customs officer.Which will make it difficult for them to get their booked flights from Hanoi later in the month..."
"@22 The unofficial official info online on several Vietnam focused websites speak of a new measure implemented March 7 requiring all travelers to present a health certificate. Plus other measures effecting UK and France passport holders.https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/informat… https:/… Did the kids submit their health certificates?https://tokhaiyte.vnEdited: 4:19 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"@23 Thanks Lenny, can't contact them at the moment but I reckon they'll have been tripped up by at least one of those restrictions/changes, if not all of them. The visa exemption is the most interesting. Still, if applying for a visa is not too onerous, they might still make it over the border. The resilience of youth!Anyway, once again, thanks, and I nod to your superior googling skills.Nigel"
Lenny - great links and up to date info.Thanks.
Glad I was able to find and share. I imagine it must be all over the Vietnam forum. Happy trails!
"I’ve been travelling around Thailand Laos and Vietnam for the past few months and I would not worry too much about the virus itself. I’ve had a really easy time travelling throughout Thailand and Laos but the Vietnam government has started to restrict many areas especially in the northern parts of the country. Some areas have been completely shut down and this includes many guesthouses making it hard to find places to stay. Cat ba island in Ha long bay is now completely shut down, at least for the moment so if you’re planing a trip to Vietnam in the next few weeks I would book places in advance and contact the guesthouses to make sure they are still open. Vietnam has been the only place so far that has been so restricting but I would still take the same precautions in other countries if you have the chance. The good news is that these countries in Asia actually don’t have that many cases of the virus so I would worry more about planning the trip in advance so that you don’t get stuck in a place which gets shut down :)"
"""good news is that these countries in Asia actually don’t have that many cases of the virus""... I actually suspect its more a case of 'some/many countries in Asia don't have the capacity to test for coronavirus and therefore reporting numbers are very low' and when it 'publicly' hits Asia it will do so with the force of a Cat 5 cyclone."
"thmoore - I totally agree.The USA doesn't have the capacity to test the number of people possibly infected and the same for most countries in Europe.So how in the world can somewhere like Cambodia, Thailand or Laos have the capacity to test for Corona virus?I hope we are wrong but I also expect a cyclone of cases to appear soon."
If you're a US Citizen you won't get into Cambodia. I have a job there that i can't get back to.

COVID-19 by nationality so far:Please see:https:/…Best regards. Ian
Be aware that ALMOST 2000 people have been tested nationwide in Cambodia!!!See details here midway through the article::https:/…That basically means for a country of roughly 16 million people only one in every 8000 people has been tested for COVID-19.
What is telling is that quote at the end regarding not having a travel ban inbound except for certain countries. Its all so mixed up now that there needs to be a simple closing of borders.
"Doug - I agree. I think all countries should announce all citizens should return to their home countries by a certain date, say April 5th, after that date the county will close its borders.The constant movement of people, including expats, back and forth is further spreading the virus. Lockdown countries for 30 - 60 days and then reassess the health situation. The constant half measures are just prolonging the epidemic."
