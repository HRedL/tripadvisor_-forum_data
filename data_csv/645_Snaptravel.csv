Greetings....I think I’m being scammed by snaptravel. Has anyone else had this experience
They are a shonky OTA that I would stay away from.
"This is one of many, MANY scam reports on the Bargain Travel Forumhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12…"
Hi there -Could you please provide more detail? We're happy to help you out.
"After a COVID-19 cancellation, they kept the money even though the hotel did not charge them. SnapTravel is a dishonest company."
I've never had an issue with snap travel. They've always been great.
"Hi Scott, we are sorry to hear about your negative experience. Can you please send us your booking confirmation number so we can look into this for you?Edited: 12:25 pm, May 25, 2020 "
I have clicked on the link numerous times for a good hotel price only for them to say that price is sold out. How about this new higher price. No thanks.
