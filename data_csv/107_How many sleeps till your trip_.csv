HI.. Just booked haven't counted the days yet coming to Jewel Oct 25th to Nov1st Steve's 50th Birthday... coming with our friends also staying at the Jewel. What should we bring outside of US dollar bills and a large cup.. ??Would like to do a day trip .. any suggestions ?J
First trip to Jamaica? I suggest Dunn's River Falls! Check with the tour desk because there are so many trips depending on your interest. What to bring?? You listed the important things! Don't laugh but I pack Cheese Whiz to feed the fish. They love it or you can get bread from the restaurants! Don't forget your camera!!!
Thank You!.. Yes first time... I've counted now 33 sleeps...YIPPEE!We will definitely be bringing some snacks and tea bags.We booked through Sunquest and we were not given the chance toadd on day trips. I saw one that was a day trip in a 4 X 4 going to places off the beaten trackWe do not want to rent one as I do not want to drive.. Any suggestions ??
There is a 4x4 trip in which you sit (strapped in) in the back and they do the driving. Friends have done it and say it is a blast.
Check out Chukka tours for 4x4 trips.
13 Sleeps till GBP

"Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow,You're only a day away!"
"WOW!!! This thread has me psyched - you folks are all so excited! Most of you (as I skip through the last few months) seem to be be JRB fans. I have not yet booked for a trip in March (family, with sons in their twenties), but am leaning towards JRB because of this. I can't find any rates better than about $168/pp/pn. Some others run cheaper, but JRB may be worth the extra money, right? GBP seems to be running in second. HELP ME DECIDE! I've targeted the Runaway Bay area, for its proximity to places we might want to explore on those few times we venture off the resort. But now I see a similar thread is running for Negril resorts. It's so hard to make a decision - any help? Thanks!"
Today!
141 Days..... before we go to RDCC

56 more days till GBP for a wedding
"Sadly, it seems our next countdown wil be alot farther off than we had hoped. We priced out the same week at GBP in March in 2013 that we had been in 2012, only to find that there is now an 1800.00 increase in the price we paid for the same period. OUCH!! When we priced it our a couple months ago it had increased 1500.00. Seems that the prices are going up at a rapid pace. Initially I thought they were trying to recoup their resort's expansion expenses til I started pricing out other options and soon discovered that everywhere we looked we are finding outrageous pricing...and not limited to Jamaica either. Looks like a homegrown vacay this summer instead., and fingers crossed the pricing will come back in line for next fall/ winter."
Curious what you thought of the property. How was the wedding?? Did you get married at the resort? My daughter will be having an upcoming wedding and trying to figure everything out.
13 sleeps till our trip to Royal Decameron Montego Beach. looking at doing a day trip up to the Dunns then over to Kingston to check out the Bob Marley Museum any suggestions on guides? or should we rent a car and do the drive our selves??

My son and I's first trip to Jamaica, my hubby's been many times but his first time at an all inclusive. This will also be my son's first time flying, so he is excited about that and I am excited for him."
If you don't mind me asking...what was the price? Are you flying West Jet? You can send me a pm if you want. It just to see if the travel agent was fooling us about some things she said or not. She told us that the longer u wait the higher it can go and that last minute deals don't normally exist for GBP or Jamaica. Thanks
The previous reply was meant for cjaq. Seems to be showing up in the original thread sorry.

"Hey Bill, is that a direct out of JFK? I like the Caribbean Air flight out of JFK. Gets you into Mobay at 8:30am and on property before breakfast is over. Like gaining a whole day."
"It is direct, Cocotel. Leaves at 9 am and touches down at around 1. I agree with you on Caribbean Air. We did that the last time and were at the resort before 11. My wife hated the fact that we had to start the day at 3 am, so I opted to keep the peace and leave slightly later. Plus, we were wiped out by 6 pm that night from jet lag, rum punch and Jamaican culture. Gotta be careful!!!"
Cocotel I will serve you breakfast anytime of day that you come just let me know. I will even have eggboy waiting in the front for you.scott from jrb

I've never been so excited in my life plus it's our first holiday together! We've had it booked 14months! And I've been counting down the days ever since! I'm just worrying about the weather will it rain all the time? Will I come back with a tan will we enjoy it as I'm only 18 and he's 22!! All the holiday jitters are setting in now and I just want some honesty!! And breath!
"Take a deep breath Hannaa, doubtful it will rain the whole time. Normally a quick rain in the afternoon here and there. As long as you r sitting out in the sun you will get a tan, maybe even a burn. I'm sure you will have a blast. How bad could it be if your on a beautiful tropical island with your boyfriend. Just remember. Whatever happens in Jamaica, never happened.Enjoy!"
"Just 17 more sleeps to go until we go to Jamaica for the first time!!! Staying at the GBP and hoping for a great trip, I am looking to book a couple of excursions...anyone have any tour companies they would suggest?? We are looking at the Good Hope Estate which I believe can only be booked through Chukka and then the Mystic Mountain, any suggestions for who to book this tour with, both value and quality are important to us. Also, anything you would do instead of either of these trips out?"
Contact Paul Williams. http://www.paulsjamaicatours.comHe is the best.

"HiMe and my girlfriend are going to runaway bay on the 23rd June. I can't wait and I've spoken to lots of people who have family out there or have been to Jamaica before. Now, my girlfriend keeps looking at the weather every day and seeing storm storm storm. I've tried explaining that these normally last around the hour mark and it's tropical warm rain. I had the same thing when I've been Barbados in the past. Has anybody got anything else that I can add to put my girlfriends mind at rest and get her concentrating on the holiday and not the weather? Cheers in advance Glenn"
"79 days for us!Mrchelsea2005, tell your girlfriend to stop checking the forecasts. I have been to Jamaica 4 times and every time I watch the forecast, and every time it says it is going to rain my entire vacation and everytime, it doesn't! Last time it showed rain each and every day and it rained for about 10 minutes one day."
I don't even check the weather anymore. I have been 8 times in the last 6 years and even when the forecast days rain the most I have seen was a shower lasting maybe an hour at most! The weather will be great! The only time I would be concerned is if there was a hurricane coming!
Thanks Melanie! Hopefully between us we have put her mind at rest now and she can look forward to her first taste of the Caribbean :) Have a good holiday :)

We've got about 40 sleeps till we're at JPB. I thought I really lucked out with the price and from everything I've read in the forums and on the hotel reviews I'm so incredibly excited because this hotel sounds amazing! I love snorkelling and hope to go out everyday. I once snorkelled with a sea turtle - I'd love to be able to do that again. The last time we were here we stayed at the Hilton and while the hotel was great the beach was not so great. I'm hoping the waterpark is complete for my boys and I can't believe how how much Scott does to help out the JPB guests! I'm also hoping to bring some supplies for the local school. Winter (or I guess Fall) has been pretty unpleasant so far. A trip in January is going to be a real treat for us. I'm also excited for the food! And the beach party ( and dinner on the beach). I hope to visit the blue hole (I think that's what it's called). And I hope I see some wildlife. I love taking pictures. I'm excited to take a trip on the glass bottom boat and even to just how out in a kayak for awhile....and I can't forget a tan! I'm really looking forward to sitting in the sun and soaking up some much needed vitamin D. This is probably one of the longest posts here but I hope you're all in the same boat and excited as heck for your upcoming vacations.
"26 sleeps to GBP for 10 days over Christmas, can't wait!"

"Hi, 67 sleeps until Grand Bahia Principe Jamaica. I'm so excited as its been 7 years since I've been back to JA!"
I'm down to 119 days 18hrs now....not that I'm excited lol
We are down to 7 sleeps... Our last visit was in 2014. We are travelling to Port Antonio for 3 nights before heading to Negril for 4 nights on beach and 2 on the cliffs.Our countdown began at 55 when we pulled the trigger on plane tickets. I'm surprised how quickly the time has passed. Checking the forums regularly is great therapy.I wish you all wonderful vacations and Sweet Jamaican dreams in the meantime.
"Must have been the luck of the Irish yesterday but, We're down to double digits. 99 Sleeps till JRB."
We now have 116 days 20 hrs 47 mins now .I'm so excited for some sun sea and rum x
"Hi recycleteen,We are 115days. The slushy drinks you were asking about are strawberry dakara and pina colada with or without rum, yum yum. The choice of rum flavoured drinks are endless eg, coconut, cappachino, white, dark, light, rum cream which is very similar to Bailey's. Do you know what type of room you are getting ? Personally i wouldn't stay in a courtyard room, ask for a garden cottage. Seaview cottages are extra money.x"
Hi Gordon568Just showed my husband Don the list of Rum and he's salivating..I love just plain rum and coke...but slushie drinks are so refreshing. We are booked into the garden cottage and I will make sure I get it lol. It really looks like a beautiful hotel...I'm looking forward to seeing the humming birds too. I have water shoes all packed too... can you tell me if the sea is quite calm..I'm hoping so....
