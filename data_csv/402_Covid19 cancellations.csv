"We have booked a hotel in Bellagio with a pre-paid non-cancellable rate for the end of May. The hotel is refusing to postpone our trip to next year stating they still think they will be open in May. From what I'm reading, this sounds unrealistic. Anybody have any thoughts on Italy re-opening hotels in May? Or should we just kiss our money goobye?"
"No one here - or, anywhere - has any idea what will be happening next month in Italy with respect to this question.This is the inherent risk of pre-paid non-refundable bookings - it is a risk as it is most often less pricey than paying at the end of your stay.They may not be open in May and, from what I understand, many of such bookings have been offering guests the chance to rebook for a later date - or, not. Some of them are not making such offers. It is up to them. Travel businesses are really reeling from the financial impact of this situation - some may not even be in business in the future if this goes on much longer -"
"As a non-refundable booking, it is up to the discretion of the hotel / booking website. However, many people have received some type of relief on non-refundable bookings due to COVID-19.Most cancellation policies related to COVID-19 have been incremental. Airlines / hotels / tour companies have created special COVID-19 policies and pick a random end date. Once that date approaches, they update the policy to include more eligible dates. I would wait a little longer - at least a couple of weeks - before trying to cancel this hotel reservation.Edited: 1:40 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"Thanks for the info. I will give them more time. All the other hotels we had booked for our 3 week trip, including other pre-paid hotels have graciously allowed us to re-book for 2021."
you will be swimming to get to Italy from MI i at the end of May of this year.

"USA_Drew, apparently poster #4 never reads the questions and prefers to jump in with her/his ridiculous same old, same old news. Such an arrogant and completely unacceptable attitude at the most difficult time! I do not know why TA admins presently allow so many trolls on the forums, but it is their decision... well, so be it. @OP, have you called the hotel or just emailed them? It always makes sense to call and maybe ask to speak to their manager (assuming in such a touristy place as Bellagio the hotel staff speaks English - in the past, I had called several times to my Menaggio hotel asking about parking and they were very accommodating). Good luck!Edited: 4:03 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"It really is a shame that trolls like the poster @#4 just continue to make their glib, unamusing little comments, when so many people have lost money, holidays, businesses and at worst their lives. Pathetic really."
Well first this virus is far from finished here in US and OP will not be traveling that is for sure...from everything I have read hotels in Italy will probably not be open for tourism in May. I would watch and see what the Italian government does next in terms of orders...if they cannot offer the hotel room due to being closed you should be able to change to future date or get a refund. Most hotels as OP found out are being reasonable...non refundable never anticipated a pandemic of this magnitude. I would not kiss the money goodbye OP.
"most of you poster give a faules sense of travel advice to travellers on this situation bad advice on some issues on this forum it is what it is, the same old line trolls on the forum. #8 I totally agree.Edited: 3:45 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"I agree with the previous comments criticising Holachical's irrelevant, unnecessary and troll-like posts. This is the second time in two days (at least) that Holachical has made knee-jerk posts about coronavirus in response to people travelling in May 2021. No-one remotely knows what the situation will be in twelve month's time.While Holachical's post 9, albeit so poorly written as to be almost imcomprehensible, appears to be insulting garbage.Edited: 6:56 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"Completely agree, perilizia! Some people are just enjoying being laughing stocks."
