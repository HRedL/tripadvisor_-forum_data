"Thinking about doing a U by Uniworld river cruise for our honeymoon this October. Happy with the inclusions and itinerary, just looking for reviews from real travelers not ‘guests of uniworld’. Anyone been or heard anything about U by Uniworld? I know they’ve dropped the French cruises and also the age restriction but that’s about it. Thanks."
I don't know what you are asking exactly but I do have one tip for you. The closet space is tiny so bring only clothes that will fold into drawers. Pair down shoes too....one walking and one dressy. If you can buy one of the suites it will be worth it. I prefer 'The B' over the A even though they are pretty much the same but that won't work for you if you are going in 2019. Have a wonderful time. Happy honeymoon.
Thanks all.I’m guess I’m really just looking for general thoughts on the company. I’ve had a look on cruise critic but there doesn’t seem to be too much about them on the boards.
"Okay then I can say that you'll find a genuine commitment to exceeding guest expectations at Uniworld. Other luxury lines are Tauck and Crystal. Scenic is nice too but they can forget about customer service from time to time if there are any problems to overcome. Tauck does not own/control their ships or operations and Crystal is altogether new to river cruising though both companies are not new to excellent customer service.But, you are not planning to go on one of Uniworld's 'superships'. Instead your reduced price on U by Uniworld will mean reduced cabin size and reduced amenities and inclusions but a commitment to wonderful service and dining remains.Uniworld is THE company that reinvented river cruising for the North American market which includes probably the most demanding of guests. They have long experience in well pleasing their guests.If you are going in 2019 then quickly hop onto their website as they have a great offer going for one more day for the main product....not sure it that applies also to U by Uniworld.If you are not finding many U by Uniworld reviews it's because that is a new product line within Uniworld.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Just returned from ""Rolling on the Rhine"" with U by Uniworld. Had an exceptional time. My wife and I were traveling with another couple, but met so many others on board. To be clear, this is an active trip. The ""U"" brand is marketed to active travelers. Ages on our trip spanned from 30s to 60s. The food was very good with a wide variety for every meal. Rooms were small, but very well thought out, well appointed, and every inch utilized. Bed was as good as any 5 star hotel. There is enough room for all your things. Every evening has an activity in the lounge, but if you are looking for some quiet, the upper deck is quite peaceful. There is a lot of ""U"" time. In each port, they'll take you on a walk around the area just to point out the highlights then you get to explore on your own. Some ports have an organized hike or bike ride. A couple of days we rode 15 miles as a group. Then you get back on the ship to cruise on the Rhine while watching old castles go by as you chill on the upper sundeck. The staff are so kind and work hard to make you happy. They act more like friends than servants which really sets the tone for a relaxed, fun setting. I've read comparisons of U vs. the others. Make no mistake, this is a very different cruise line and U by Uniworld is not Uniworld. It is less expensive, but still VERY nice and a more contemporary looking ship than formal. If you prefer to be active on your vacations with a younger more energetic crowd, want to see some cool small European towns while your hotel moves for you, be taken care of by friends, enjoy good music, drinks, and excellent food then this is the line for you."
DYLAURWOW I am sure they are not your friends but to call the crew/staff servants that is quite a rude comment
"Well, we know what he was trying to convey Lyn so let's forgive him for using that verbiage.Dylar, great review but I had to laugh when you said ""There's enough room for all your things."" You mean don't bring many 'things' don't you? LOL. I've seen the A but cruised on the B. Do like the big drawers at the foot of the bed and that's why, way back when on this thread, I suggested bringing clothes that do well folded.What would you say was your favorite day time activity off the ship and your favorite night time as well???Thanks for taking the time to find this old thread and add your detailed review.Edited: 1 year ago "
"CCCno matter how you slice it they are not servants ...they are employees, crew, staff it implies that DYLAUR feels superior or maybe he has servants at home it is not Downton Abbey"
"Probably just selected the wrong word for the staff and, perhaps, wanted to illustrate the wide difference between friends and staff."
"My husband and I just ended the Danube Flow on the A. Dylaur's review is very accurate. U by Uniworld is an exceptionally high quality cruise for a younger and/or more active crowd. Just a few additional points:1. The ship is nearly paperless. The Daily Schedule is sent via Whats App. Download it at home before your trip.2. Drink prices onboard (wines by the glass and cocktails are 9 euros) are high considering there are so many cute bars/cafes in the European ports offering drinks starting at 4 euros or less. We bought all our drinks while in port.3. The studio and balcony rooms are the same size. The only difference is a sliding glass door in the balcony rooms. The windows in the studio rooms do not open.4. Although the website lists 3 meals a day, this includes an early riser continental breakfast. Lunch was served only once. However, the buffet breakfasts and dinners are so large, we just had a small local snack or gelato for lunch each day.5. There are many late night outings to local bars or dancing in the U Lounge. Fortunately, no tour stated before 9:00 in the mornings, so passengers could party hardy and still get some sleep.6. I estimate 95 percent of the 100 passengers were between 30 and 65, and approximately half of those were under 45. There were two young Australian Youtube ""influencers"" on board. The company is marketing heavily towards millennials.7. Nearly all the passengers were from English-speaking nations and the official language for the crew is English."
"Just returned from a one week trip on the ""A"" down the Danube from Budapest to Regensberg. I absolutely loved the cruise and would recommend it to anyone who is active and young at heart. A little background here - I am a very active late 50's lady traveling with hubby, sister and her kids (boys in their 20s). I was a bit hesitate to book this cruise since it used to have an age limit of 40 or 45. I thought it would be a big party boat and people would be too crazy for me. Not true at all. There were people of all ages and I ended up to be the partying person on the boat - not really.I was on a Viking's river cruise down the Rhine last year 2018 with my in laws, I was bored to tears on that trip. But to be honest Viking does pamper you a bit more if you like that sort of things, i.e., bus tours instead of walking tours, sit down meals instead of buffet. Airport pick up instead of making it on the cruise on your own.Okay, back to my review of the ""A""Itinerary - fantastic itinerary from Budapest to Regensberg Germany, it was beautiful with the fall color, the weather was awesome, the pace was great, and it was just long/short enough for a nice vacation.Excursions - I loved the fact that all excursions start later than other River cruises, around 9 or 10 a.m. I also enjoyed all the walking and hiking tours and lots of free time for exploring the towns. I loved the fact that I was able to complete 2 days of 30 KM bike rides along the Danube.Ship - I love the setup and the facilities on the ship. The rooms are small but have lots of storage space that we didn't even need. Lots of USB charging ports so you don't have to worry about converters. There is a small gym, actually pretty big for a size of the ship, there is a free laundry room which was very handy (you have to pay for soap) but not for the use of the washer/dryer. There is a lounge for all the partying activities, a dining room for all the food, and Ice Bar which I am sorry to say that I never enjoyed. The Ice Bar is also used for Yoga, stretching, and other morning exercise classes which I did enjoy once. The sound proofing on the ship is quite good, when you are in the room, you don't hear any partying or any noise.Price - This cruise is priced below all the other River cruises probably because you don't get the bus pick up, bus tours, sitdown meals, and only get 2 meals a day which was perfect for us since when we get to a town, we just wonder around to get local food during the day.Food - I thought the food was fantastic! The chefs are from the parent company Uniworld which is a high end cruise line and the food does not disappoint. I love the buffet style dining since you can come and go as you please and are not restrict to a specific time to show up for meal. There were enough variety of food every day to keep our interest. I also find that the drinks were not as expensive as the other river cruise.Entertainment - Every night there was a music theme DJ party which was quite lively. In comparison to the other river cruise, it was more exciting and definitely more of a partying vibe. I left the kids alone to party most of the time, but did join one night to boogy a bit on Funky Town night - there might be youtube video of that said night floating around.I am not sure what I am missing here except that our family cannot wait to book another U by Univerworld cruise in the next year for all to join. We really had a fabulous time!"
Thank you all for those informative reviews! My young-hearted little group will be booking tomorrow.
Sue owns Lake Zurich Travel. Ask her if she has any Signature perks or discounts if you book with her. Can also check for discounts with AAA Travel and Costco. These all have specials on Uniworld but I don't know the pricing arrangements on the U. Worth a try. Have fun.
Scheduled to cruise from Milan to Venice mid April. UniWorld has been slow to cancel or reschedule!!!Viking has already rescheduled my trip in July.Not happy with UNIWORLD
"This thread is for their division, U by Uniworld. The Venice cruise is part of the main product, Uniworld.Uniworld has a long history of well taking care of their guests including when 'events' arise. I'm sure you will soon be offered reschedule options."
"For Uniworld's (not U by Uniworld, although it probably will be the same) policy on cancellation for COVID-19, see the following forum on Cruise Critic. https:/…"
"As a long time cruiser with Uniworld over the past 10 years or so I am writing to voice my huge disappointment in your company. We were scheduled for 2 cruises this summer which had to be cancelled and I am still waiting for almost $13,000 of refunds which are to be made in cash. In addition we were required to take almost $5,000 in Future Cruise Credits which I am not happy about considering how we have been treated in this situation.As a business person I have no idea why in the world it takes this long to get back funds which simply needed to be credited to the credit card on which they were charged. Your reputation in my eyes has been damaged to a large degree which is to bad as we have loved our cruising experience with Uniworld in places like France, Portugal, China, Vietnam, Egypt, and Germany. We were scheduled to do the Danube with the side trip to the Passion Play as well as the Northern Italy trip this summer. I am sure I am not the only dissatisfied customer you have these days waiting for their refunds. Our friends who we also cruise with and have many more cruises than us are beyond livid at the situation.Please rectify this soon as I can promise you that you will lose any future business of ours except for the use of the FCC which we were forced to accept. It is also not a good policy that only those who have booked with you directly are allowed to contact you. We have always booked with an agent and this is frustrating for her as well as us.Doubt you will respond to a silly email when you can not even get people their money that you have had for well over a year. It was time to vent and am looking for the proper site to post a copy of this letter to let others beware in our current environment that although your refund policy may sound fair in reality you hold your customers money well beyond the point of reason."
"MARY K This is a public forum & UNIWORLD may or may not be checking posts here most likely NOT You should contact UNIWORLD or have your TA do it Most cruise lines are working with limited staff working from home due to the pandemic most lines are taking up to 90 days for refunds but if you have not heard from Uniworld in that time frame maybe put in a dispute with your credit card company ..the refund may not come any faster but you will have a claim startedJMOJust to add the Passion Play has been cancelled so you will not see it even if the cruise were to go aheadEdited: 1:38 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Exactly Lyn and, yes, the office staff was indeed equipped and sent home to do business from there."
