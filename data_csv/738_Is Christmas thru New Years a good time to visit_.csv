"Hi All,Since my trip for this month to Bali has been cancelled, I am looking to reschedule for mid December thru early January. I am wondering if that is a good time to go? Are all the restaurants and sites open? Is there anything special to do for NYE in Bali?My friend that I was originally going to be traveling with might not be able to come with me anymore so this might turn into a Solo trip for a first time visitor.All advice is welcome.Thank you everyone."
"We have spent a number of Christmas/NYE's in Bali and have enjoyed it thoroughly. The Balinese make this time pretty special for its visitors and you will be delighted at the lovely decorations and effort put in to make it a holiday to remember.Do keep in mind that it is Wet season and so you have to expect rain, which at times could be for the whole day, a day or two, or perhaps just during the night. That said, we've never had a complete wash out at this time of year and there's been enough sunny days to enjoy any day trips in the outdoors we had planned...just be flexible with perhaps having to change days.As for NYE, it depends on what you are looking for. There are many places which put on a big night of food, music and fireworks. We stay away from the busy tourist areas and enjoy a quieter night, so you can decide what best suits you.I am sure you will enjoy your time in Bali and yes everything is open during this time."
"I would consider rescheduling until next year, unless of course you're prepared for a 2nd disappointment."
"I wouldn't be booking anything until we have a better idea of how the coronavirus pandemic is developing unless everything is refundable. Aside from that a lot of people do visit Bali over Christmas/New Year which also happens to be the rainy season and when beaches in the south are often covered with trash. When I lived in Bali we'd usually book a table at a hotel restaurant for Christmas go out somewhere with friends on New Year's Eve.Again, if the coronavirus issue is over or much reduced then all restaurants and sites should be open."
"Hi bebe, along with Post#1 we spend the festive season in Bali each year (although we fly out on NYE) and we are not deterred by the weather. Enjoy the same experiences as Post#1. Everything’s open; a very popular time in Bali as it’s Australian and Indonesian school holidays and many visitors from Java. Traffic can be hectic and it’s advised you’re in walking distance of a venue for NYE celebrations. We enjoy the buzz. Depends which areas you originally chose to stay. As mentioned many places to enjoy the celebration. Many women travel solo to Bali. Use your commonsense as you would in your own hometown.Stay on top of Covid-19 advice. Cheers.Edited: 7:59 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"I like your optimism, we don't know how this will pan out and it might be that we'll all be travelling again by Christmas. I certainly hope so. However I'm not sure Bali over the Christmas break is the greatest time. It's the long Australian summer school holidays and the price of accommodation and flights will be high due to demand. The traffic is also bad then because of the numbers and local shop and tour prices rise also. That's during 'normal' times' - if no one has been able to travel till then, there'll be a stampede of people booking holidays over this time. If you can move to early December or into February, you might find it a bit easier and cheaper. Another benefit is that February is that much further away, meaning even more chance of your holiday going ahead."
"There are no lock down in Indonesia, but nowadays transportation only run 10 to 20 percent than normal, after Covid-19 decrease, so all will come to normal and you can see from the transportation. Maybe need at least 2 weeks to 6 weeks to see the conditions, if PSBB is extended, so the area has still many of positive Covid-19 patients. On April 23, 2020 PSBB in Jakarta will be extended or not. No PSBB in Bali, so it means Bali can handle Covid-19 well.Ied Holiday Season has moved from May to 28-31 December 2020, so there are many domestic tourists in Bali, but do not worry about hotels, villas and apartments, Bali is oversupply of it."
"I have no idea what the first paragraph in post 6 means at all. However, in his second paragraph if his Ied is supposed to be Eid al-Fitr, and it has been moved from May to December 28th- 31st, it will be a nightmare in Bali. That is of course if things are back to normal and the usual number of International tourists go to Bali. It would be the last place on earth I would want to be at that time."
"I haven't been looking at the forum for a few days so not sure what post #6 said. But if it's about the mudik for people to go back to their homes for Idul Fitri, it's been moved. The holy days are on May 23 and 24, but the collective holidays ""cuti bersama"" seem to have been moved to Dec 28 to 31. Here's a Jakarta Post article about it: https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/…"
Thanks Mango. No idea what his first babble was all about but I got he was talking about Eid al fitr in his second paragraph.Nope I would not want to be in Bali during that time.
"Christmas and New Year is a good time to visit Bali. It is the wet season but that does not mean that yo will experience a lot of rain, it is more humid in the wet season. I go at this time of the year and really enjoy the atmosphere. Keep in mind when you are choosing places to stay that there is often compulsory charges for NYE and xmas lunch / dinner. These charges can be anything from modest to hundreds of dollars per person. Many hotels, shops, restaurants put up xmas decorations and get into the xmas spirit. Closer to the festive season hotels and restaurants start to advertise what they plan to do for xmas and NYE. On NYE many roads are closed and others are very congested so it is important to consider that you may need to be walking distance to where you wish to celebrate. Everything will be open and it will be busier in Bali due to Aussie school holidays. Enjoy your planning. Even though there is no travel at this stage it doesn't cost anything to research and plan."
"Normally peak season in Bali is August, but the occupancy rate is only not more than 60 percent average. In Ied Holiday Season, the occupancy rate is lower, and also December and January never exceed August."
Have you been to Bali at Christmas time Sarwa?
