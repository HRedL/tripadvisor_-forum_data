"Hi , I'm hoping to travel to Puerto Del Carmen next Friday, I have no problem with isolating for 14 days when I return home because my husband and I are both retired . How many others are travelling next week ? . I think as long as we abide by the rules whilst there we should be fine ."
"Have you checked your insurance we should have gone on Tuesday, fourteen days isolating on return no problem not being insured a risk we didn’t want to take, if you go have a lovely time we are still hoping to go at the end of the month"
"lynandStocktononTees, i do have annual insurance from last year which wont cover us for covid 19 so seriously hoping we won't need it ( I will double check it though ) fingers crossed we have a virus free holiday .Hope you get to go on your holiday end of August."
We’re hoping to go to PDC on 19 August. Just checking out insurance & see on some forums Battleface has been recommended if FCO advice still remains. Thankfully can quarantine if necessary and as a frontline healthcare worker I need a break!
"Battleface just quoted me for a 66 and 65 year old, wait for it ,for 1 week................................£112. I do not think soEdited: 1:41 am, August 03, 2020 "
Those high risk insurance companies are expensive but personally I'd prefer to take the hit and have peace of mind. The chances of something happening are slim but the costs for things like repatriation are insane. The last thing I want is to have to do some pitiful Go Fund Me charity fundraiser and get my sad mug in the papers because I'm stranded abroad in a full body cast - and I have the worst luck so I know if it's gonna happen to anyone it would be me! : )
We are due to fly out in 5 weeks. We are booked with Jet2 who Im sure will cancel the holiday if nothing changes however if they don't then we will be going as planned with or without insurance etc as we don't want to waste the money we have spent on the holiday and we are both in desperate need of a break!
"we travelling in september , no probs at all with flight , travel , cant wait , safer in lanza than in uk"
"hi , same here we going, regardless, need a break from all this doom and gloom , bring it on ,"
Going no where till at least Summer 2021.
"Yeah I’m heading out Friday 7 th August,A little bit nervous but I’ve read a lot of reviews & I know it’s going to be quite but looking forward to it."
"Peter f, I share your sentiments, we are off to fuerteventura in 2 weeks time."
We are due to travel on friday but unfortunately won't be going as our insurance is void. Not worth it with accident prone kids!
Emma M i dont think these insurance companies cover you for repatriation it only covers you for medical expenses. Happy to be told im wrong though!
I'm 37 and of good health. My parents are mum 64 and dad 70. My dad has copd. Heard about battleaxe. Would they insure us to go Lanzarote 2 weeks in September if FCO advice still remains and what will we be covered for?
"Google Battleaxe, as I did and get the quote from them."
Arrived Yesterday. Only 28 on flight from shannon Ireland. So far really glad we came.
"I'm fairly sure some people don't understand the potential consequences of travelling with void insurance.We have had to finally bin our rearranged holiday as we cannot do the quarantine. But if we could, we'd surely be booking that Battleaxe thing."
Its Battleface not Battleaxe
Thanks for all the replies
"Phil you'd have to read their policy and do a quote. They won't cover Covid expenses for anyone over 59. If your dad has copd he is more vulnerable. Is being in a busy airport where often social distancing often can't be maintained, or even on a flight a good idea?We're 60 and 66 and they quoted me £198 for 2 weeks, no pre existing conditions covered, with an excess of £250. The cover is basic at best."
Have a look at Avanti.
Sorry hit submit too soon. Theydont have an upper age limit and from the e mail I received today a lot is covered.
"Avanti covers lots. But it doesn't cover COVID-19 , says on 1st page of the Website."
This was received by e mail. yesterday.Extensive cover against coronavirus^You fall ill with COVID-19 abroad and need medical treatment or repatriation back to the UK tickYou fall ill with COVID-19 abroad and need to extend yourstay as a result tickYou or a household member fall ill with COVID-19 at home and you have to cancel your travel plans due to self-isolation* tickYou are denied boarding on your pre-booked outbound travel due to you contracting COVID-19 tickYou need to curtail your trip as a close relative has passed away from COVID-19** tickYour airline or travel provider goes into administration*** tick
TattyJust read the avannti policy and you’re right they do cover all that but they make it very clear on their website that if the travel is declared unsafe (against fco) then it’s void and they offer you a change of dates
It covers all that to a safe areas Click the Coronavirus link on top of website it’s all stated there You have 14 days to cancel free
They seem a good company and have used them a couple of times but not made a claim!Yes if people travel against FCO then insurance is null and void.
"In response to the original post, yes we are ""risking it"" and will follow the protocols, which in anyones clear thinking mind must appear quite bizarre given the 99.98 percent recovery rate from this thing."
Borrowed from another site.142 acute corona cases are currently reported in the Canary Islands. Most of them are currently reported in Tenerife but no deaths for weeks
"Well you have various different types of risking it!You have the financial risk, and we have lost over a grand on a family reunion in august because elderly relatives quite rightly don't want to risk it.And you have the physical risk, the percentages arent quite that straight forward, this isnt some macho I'm going going prove how hard I am by taking on an incurable illness!I think you need to do a bit more research....both my childminders mums have died from this. My wife middle aged, fit healthy has post Covid life changing symptoms so I don't have much time for those belittling the risks of Covid. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy so please have a think before making silly comments Darren.Edited: 5:58 am, August 04, 2020 "
Some friends of mine flew out on Sunday the flight from Gatwick had 94 people out of possible 220 the Manchester flight had 88 which considering most of Manchester is supposed to be in lock down is quite high I thought. So seems quite a few are risking it.
"I agree accoubtant75. As someone with blood cancer and on chemo I'm i the extremely vulnerable category. Have been locked up since March!! I sympathise with people who think that this is just another virus, but personally know 2 fit previously healthy young men in their early 30s who almost died from this. And others who have been left severely debilitated.Whist it may not to a large extent impact those who are young and fit, you can still be carriers and infect those more vulnerable. People like me have little chance of surviving this! So we do need to protect our communities as a whole.It's a pain I know, but these are unprecedented times."
"Accountant75, not a silly comment at all, we all have opinions and they should be respected, in the meantime, trust nothing you hear via the media and question everything via research. ps, I am NOT a conspiracy theorist."
"<< the Manchester flight had 88 which considering most of Manchester is supposed to be in lock down is quite high I thought. >>They're not in lockdown, there's just restrictions on certain things in place. Nothing at all stopping them from travelling, apart from the insurance. That aside, people from all the North of England fly from Manchester."
"Darren, your dodgy percentages maybe your opinion but they are plain wrong, and ignore the millions of survivors with post Covid symptoms and injuries.Please keep your internet conspiracies to your self. Research via google is not research am afraid."
"DI you may feel safer there but the facts clearly show you’re not Today UK recorded 670 cases, Spain averages 3000 and due to technical issues yesterday, today’s figures were updated to 5760 and another 26 new deaths Considering Spain doesn’t include care homes you can imagine it to be a lot more Cases are massively higher there than here currently with all data sources and daily icu admissions are higher tooEdited: 1:25 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"That's spain as a whole, but the canaries the rate is minuscule way lower than the uk"
"accountant 75 - best post I have seen in ages. at post 31. No we are not risking it - i.e risking our lives thank you. Cases in Spain are skyrocketing and If travelling against FCO advice then no insurance cover is available for repatriation or the costs of an extended stay whilst a member of family/ friends is in hospital receiving treatment nor the cost of replacement flights. I am reading cover from Battleface is for COVID medical treatment only. Of course with 5600 new cases in Spain in the last 24 hours its quite possible they will soon have a second lockdown and you would be on your own trying to get homeEdited: 2:10 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"Darren , be fair . If you don’t trust the media and research then where do you get the figures of 99.98 % survival rates from ? Latest research is showing there MAY be long term effects from this new virus which we are only just realising . Sunshine , Di was referring to Lanzarote / Canaries so a little unfair to compare to mainland Spain . People have to bear in mind controls here are very strict and generally adhered to so yes , at the moment we probably are safer than the UK"
"@ post 38. Sunshinenvino, have a look at post 29."
"Darren’s percentage is on the conservative side if you are under 50 and in good health but I appreciate not everyone is. In fact I know this isn’t the Australia forum but my friend is in Victoria locked down with a curfew and not a single person in the whole of Australia has died of the disease in that category.Edited: 3:01 am, August 05, 2020 "
"@41, he said question everything via research not don’t trust the research, it’s really different.Edited: 3:09 am, August 05, 2020 "
"just to put this into perspective, these are the figures produced from the countries reporting. It is not a good thing for a country to report a high death rate and some might be lower than they are because of poor report facilities and I believe Iran has been shown up recently for their reporting.The death rate is 6% against those that have recovered but again some countries like the UK fail to show those recovered. In the early part in April that death rate was 22% but since then countries have got their acts together and have reduced the rate.Nobody knows the mild cases of those that don't know they have it but from UK testing it was thought only 6% has had the virus in the UK.. Spain has homes for old people and I read one was abandoned by it's carers for fear of catching it.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Edited: 3:36 am, August 05, 2020 "
"Post #43 Darren, just because people arent dying doesnt mean they arent having serious health problems."
At least everyone risking it is now insured thanks to the Canaries Government https:/…
Jet2 have said people should return to the UK ASAP or they may have to make their own arrangements for getting home. Airlines will not want to send out empty planes to bring tourists home at the end of their scheduled stay.
Swoody1971 - that's very interesting! Thanks for sharing...With 24 days until our trip we are very much in the 'risking it' category as it currently stands
Thank you for the info. Swoody1971 .Love this forum..I picked up the Battle face insurance tip yesterday too.Just hope the quarantine days reduce???
Post #47. Reading that it only covers anyone who actually tests +ve while on the island. It doesn't cover anything caused by C19 measures if you don't actually have the virus !!!
"Whatever your insurance says about covid its more important to check if it is valid travelling against FCO advice as most are null and void because of that., so nothing is covered at all."
Ouzoherb take a look at the link in post 47

"Peter L, thanks for the link. I would still be very cautious of thinking this replaces full travel insurance as without seeing the full policy wording it could well only apply if you catch Covid 19. Not for any of the many accidents that require hospitalization or more importantly repatriation to the UK which as we know is incredibly expensive. The wording to me suggests only covid cover as a positive test must be in place. If would be great if it did cover everything but I doubt it will."
I thought some sort of insurance was compulsory.
"Hi can I just ask, anyone not willing to risk it, are you going to loose money. We are due out 17th Sept with Ryanair and we will loose money if we don't go as obviously they are still flying."
"I am not willing to risk it over quarantine, I won't be allowed back to work after I return for 14 days so cannot afford 3 weeks off and only get paid for 1 week. Not to mind potential risks of health etc etc I am losing 473 Euro and Sister in law will lost 576 because be booked in January and Ryanair won't allow us to change the flights without charging us 290Euro and my SIL 430Euro to change. We cannot justify paying such a high change price % to move to next week where the flights are actually cheaper than what we paid already. It also annoys me that they want 10Euro to change the bag over on each booking on top of moving the pax on the flight."
I know we can't move our flights without paying an admin fee. I think they should cancel fees if fco is saying it is essential travel only.
"I'm not in the UK but the process is similar in Ireland, Ryanair don't see it as being their problem. They say that the flights will continue because there are those flying who don't need to quarantine(exempt) or are going the other way so that they would deprive them of their flights and until the government(s) advise that you cannot travel between the countries then they will continue to do so.Putting on my capitalism hat I don't blame Ryanair for keeping this attitude and planes in the air, if they grounded their fleet they'd be in serious trouble financially(as other airlines would). I would personally be more annoyed being a Jet2 customer where they are dragging people home early from their holidays even thought the FCO in the UK say you do NOT need to leave Spain right now just quarantine when you do go home. Jet 2 say they don't want to fly empty planes out to get people but on the 29th July they flew 7 flights to the Canaries yet only 2 of them were scheduled flights meaning 5 were empty to bring people home so frankly they can fly empty flights when they want to though."
"Canary Islands Gov has announced free insurance, covering all tourists, should they catch cv on holiday. Up to 150k in medicall bills, effective now until Oct 2021, no sign up, all automatically covered."
"All visitors now insured for free should they contract cv during their stay by the CI Govt. Extends til Oct 2021. Covers accomm, flights, medicall bills etc"
"Official information from the Cabildo de Lanzarote about the coronavirus on the island, maybe of interest to people considering visiting. https://www.lanzarotecovid19.com/en/"
"We should be visiting on 5th September for 7 days but cannot have another 14 days off work when we return. So we will be losing the money for our flights.Edited: 5:21 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Sparkybill If you are resigned into losing your money, do not cancel the flight as that is final. You are 4 weeks away and things are changing on a daily basisEdited: 6:07 am, August 07, 2020 "
"BA just cancelled my flights from Gatwick so have got a refund and will be booking up for June next year . Apartment owner will let me change date, God I hope ive had the vaccine by then and this all goes away."
#67 Not going to cancel flights but with the way things are going in Spain it may get worse before it gets better.
"You cant' cancel your flights or there's no point anyway as you don't get a cent/penny back. I would, and have in real life, asked people not to check in online though because if, by some mirarcle, people get offered to move their flights makes it very hard to do it when you've checked in. It can be done with human interaction and people are very hard to get hold of in the airlines right now."
