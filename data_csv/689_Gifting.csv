Will gifting be okay for awhile when we are allowed to return to Cuba?They must be getting pretty low on dollar store junk.Perhaps we could make an exception till they get re-stocked.
@rat - Are you asking for permission from the 'TA Anti-Gifting Police'????
"Yes, kinda sad when you even care what the TA police think.... use your own judgement.."
This is not a totalitarian site. Make up your own mind.
Dollar store junk gives it away. That and your other post. Drenched with sarcasm.
Take yourself and loads of us$.They will dance little monkey just for you.
"This is the perfect time to start fresh an abandon the random gifting thing...it's been an embarrassing issue that we started and now has just about everybody begging for it to stop. Let's gift them with our presence not presents and a few Cuc's/US$ (not Canadian damit! :) here and there of course :) While gifting ourselves with Cuba, we'd also be gifting ourselves (and them:) with dignity, pride, happiness, and maybe even some real tears of joy :)"
WOW larry you have actually written some sense.
Thanks Diva...I've really matured during covid-19 isolation but then again so has the tree on my front lawn :)
Obvious sarcasm is obvious.
Post 10 ???
"#7, Canadian dollars may be deposited in the new MLC accounts too."
"I am sure it has been discussed on here in depth, I haven't seen the threads though, I prefer to just tip with cash, I do however bring the odd thing that may be hard or impossible to get in Cuba: guitar tuners, bicycle repair kits, Swiss Army knives etc!"
"I was taking some of that laundry detergent, along with my vet supplies, still in the bag, ready to go. Hope it will be alright by the time I get there."
Just to set the record straight.I would not take dollar store junk to Cuba even if they were giving it away here.I was just taking a poke at the gifting bear.
I think I’m the only one on here that knows your humour.
Gifting is a topic that will never die.I just like to have a little fun with it every now and then.
"@ Lori I think I got the sarcasm/humour as well, I just don't know who the hell the ""Gifting Bear"" is! lol"
"Yes, @rat .... we know you were taking a poke at the 'anti-gifting lobby' here on TA."
Don't poke the bear same as don't mess with the bull you are liable to get the horn.
"All too often, when you are being satirical, the danger is that you may be taken seriously. The corollary to that, I suppose, is that sometimes when you are being serious, it may be taken as satire. I'm not sure which is worse."
You get both serious and satire on a gifting thread every time.That is what makes it so much fun.
"Whole heartedly agree with Lucky Larry way back @7. That has to be the most profound and reasonable things that you've ever posted on TA! Are you feeling OK?? HA!But yes! I think that just gifting all of Cuba with our presence there again is all that's required. The days of tossing trinkets to the natives was already out of date at the end of colonialism. Here's a novel idea... the next time you're able to visit Cuba, give of your time to them, even just for a chat with a Cuban. That will mean more to a Cuban than anything material that you could possibly give them. And if it doesn't, then they're not worth the time of day otherwise. Easy peasy.TerryEdited: 1:30 pm, August 09, 2020 "
You will be amazed at what you can learn by doing just that.You may even meet a new friend
"Terry, I agree with you on all three points. But I hope that not too many will misinterpret your last paragraph to mean that they should preach capitalism to them. That might not be appreciated."
"Jack, capitalism is alive and well in Cuba... for better or for worse. I don't have to preach it... everyone that I know in Cuba also knows that capitalism represents Cuba's future. And that's not to confuse capitalism as opposed to socialism... both can exist (and should) simultaneously. Capitalism is not democracy either... it's merely an economic driver of one's economy. But rest assured, capitalism, in combination with Cuba's brand of socialism, can and will be a winning combination... each supporting the other. Terry"
"@ 11. The OP. That’s what I thought.Edited: 3:50 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Terry, I actually agree with your post @26. I should have been clearer. When I said, ""preach capitalism,"" I guess I really meant ""preach the uncaring, selfish variety of capitalism that we see in some countries.""Also, I strongly believe that none of us should preach to the Cubans what kind of system we think they need. That is up to the Cubans themselves to decide."
"Now I understand, Jack, and I also hope for the best with Cuba's meager push to capitalism.As an aside to what you mentioned though, I find it to be astounding that many of my Cuban friends and family members don't really know how capitalism works. They just know that they want it, because they associate it with what they endlessly hear about the land of milk and honey and the material riches. But if I can do anything for them, it's to explain the inner workings of how capitalism functions, along with its inherent pitfalls too. My best friend in Cuba is all ears about capitalism, because he's a rather industrious person (like most Cubans), and he appreciates me tutoring him on how to get ahead with it... even within Cuba's limited capacity of capitalism as it stands right now. He's not alone... many who can't exercise jumping in with both feet for lack of money (you need money to make money), at least they truly appreciate my inspirational talks that help to light fires under their butts to begin thinking like capitalists. It's incredible with you sense the light bulb going on... you can see it in their eyes. And that actually inspires me.TerryEdited: 8:04 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"I find capitalism thriving all over Cuba. That guy with the cart selling vegetables in the street is a capitalist. So is the guy who buys whole pigs and sell pork meat. The guy who cuts hair and the one who shines shoes. The casa owner fits the bill but so does the guy who comes down the street selling bread. The one who sells peso pizzas out of the window in their house is as much as the paladar owner. There is a driver who hauls people around in his maquina but so is the guy who pedals his bicitaxi. All capitalists. Now each individual enterprisesdoes not have high monetary volume by itself but there are so many that the total adds up. I have my own speculation of the size of the private economy, legal and illegal, compared to the government economy. Terry: do look at the definitions of capitalism and socialism. Certainly both can exist within the same economy with enterprises of both types. But the terms are mutually exclusive. Either individuals own and control the means of production for their own gain or the state owns and controls it for the overall good."
"I agree, Bob, that capitalism is already well entrenched in Cuba in the various ways that you described. There's no denying that. That's why I also indicated to Jack that capitalism is alive and well in Cuba too. But taking your list of the various capitalist endeavors that you mentioned in your first paragraph @30, it's worth noting that the common denominator to every one of those capitalist inspired businesses is that they're single entity operations, and run mostly by the owner as an individual, or perhaps together with help from the family. When I talk with my friends and family members about my vision of capitalism for them and for Cuba, I want them to think bigger. Not just owning and operating 1 bici taxi (as an example)... but fleets of bici taxis... and not just in Cam city alone, but owning and operating fleets of bici taxis in other Cuban cities as well. Now to me, that's what I call true capitalism, as opposed to mom & pop operation. I want them to dream BIG. My father used to tell me... aim for the stars, and you may hit the moon. That's how I'm trying to inspire them too.TerryEdited: 12:38 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Terry: yes, a preponderance of private businesses in Cuba are small one person operations. But there sure are a lot of them. I did a photo story in 2015 about the emergence of private businesses in Cuba after the government passed new regulations allowing such. There were a number of private businesses that had a total investment of only a few dollars. The Cuban government does not provide a reasonable environment for private business of any significant size."
"All I can say is I am so grateful that Hubby and I took the chance and travelled the way we did, because our lives have been turned up side down and inside out. If we ever get to travel again, then there will be no tipping, let alone gifting on our part. Could not care less if there is snappy service or, special free perks or, playing the stupid game of being played and playing back. It would be nice just to spend time on the beach, get something to eat and forget about this bloody life."
"Nice to hear from you again...Loraine with the one r......lol. You’re right, life’s the shi*s right now, would be nice to get away and just veg out."
"Hi There Sweet,That doesn't sound like you at all , hahaha! I remember how is was all about "" Greasing the Palm"" to get the good service.Must have had an epiphany! Salúd!"
"Hola 33 &34Geez Louise , look around where you live, not really that bad, could be a lot worse h-ll could be a lot worse just look down south, and that could get much worse....and perhaps will if not this time, the next...and this will happen again no doubt about it.I am sure every one who travels routinely, is missing not traveling, but no one is going to die from a lack of travel.  We get up each morning, that is a good day, and if we are lucky enough to wake up next to the one we love...what is more important.....?And if not...sorry for you...lolcheers. Ron"
"@30 : No, no and no. The guy who is shining shoes is not a capitalist. A vendor who sells vegetables is not a capitalist. It sound to me like very few people have ever really studied Marx, Lenin, the history of the 20th century, communist societies etc.Capitalism begins when you start hiring people and paying them only a part of the value they create. You keep the rest. Individual entrepreneurs have always been a part of the socialist and communist idea and reality. Hiring workers - that is where the conflict begins."
"Yep, and all those, cartoon like billboards, still preaching Fidel,Che, and José’s words!"
"Orbit #37: I have to disagree with you. A capitalist, by definition, is one who controls the means of production and works for their own gain. Nothing in the definition says anything about the need for having employees. The guy who buy his own brushes, rags, and shoe polish then sets his own working hours, and goes home with whatever he collects from shining shoes is a capitalist by definition. So is the guy who buys a cart, buys some vegetables, picks where and when he operates his cart, then take home the difference between what he collected and what he paid out is a capitalist. If that fruit spoils before he sells it, he suffers a capitalist loss. Do you remember about 9-10 years ago when barbers were paid a fixed salary and cut hair for whoever needed it? That was socialism. Then the government made them capitalists who paid rent for the shop, the supplies, and took home whatever they collected for cutting hair."
How about we just call them ambitious folks trying to make a buck.Seems better than giving them some political label.
"ratwalto @40, there's nothing political about capitalism. Capitalism is just an economic means of enrichment. China and Vietnam are both also communist states, along with Cuba. But I don't think anyone can argue that free market capitalism has done anything to ruin China's or Vietnam's socialism... if anything, capitalism has greatly enhanced their abilities to financially support their socialist programs. Cuba can do the same, if only they too would focus on capitalism as a form of economic enrichment for their entire population under socialism by gearing their economy to also be a net exporter. It's really that simple. Cuba already has the template of China's and Vietnam's success to follow... they just need to implement it.Terry"
"The UK, France and Germany are Democratic Socialist Countries where Capitalism thrives. Northern Ireland even had/has a socialist governing party.Once the people are able to convince the political bosses that capitalism is good for them too, change will come. Just like changes happened a few years ago when the CasaP and Paladar businesses took off."
"What Orbit has described is exactly what I meant when I talked about not preaching capitalism. I have to say that I, too think of the private business people more as entrepreneurs, rather than capitalists. But that may just be a matter of semantics.I will concede that Bob and Terry are actually correct in their definitions of capitalism, if you ignore the connotations that sometimes surround the word. Those connotations are probably the ones that keep the Cuban government from wanting to take free enterprise too far.Most definitions describe socialism as “a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.”By contrast, most definitions describe capitalism as “an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit.”Very few (if any) countries have a system that is 100% one or the other.I am not convinced that a country that has social programs that support their citizens in time of need could actually be considered socialist. The state, or community does not own or control a means of production in that case. The state simply provides an essential service to the citizens. So, unemployment insurance, government sponsored health care, even a guaranteed income are not socialism. They are socially responsible programs that the state operates to support its citizens.In Cuba’s case, as in Viet Nam, the system is basically socialist with room for a certain amount of free enterprise. To hope for capitalism in Cuba, to me, implies hoping for a return to the system where large corporations control the means of production, and I don’t believe that is what the majority of Cubans want. Of course, even if it is what the majority wants, it is none of my business to interfere in that, either."

"Spunky, thanks for the link to the 14ymedio article. People should note that 14ymedio is as politically biased as Granma, just in the other direction. There is a clue in the second sentence with the phrase "" ..... though it continues to pay people’s wages in a worthless currency"". Now Cuba certainly has economic problems but to call the CUP and the CUC ""a worthless currency"" is a bit dramatic. It does not matter which side you are on so long as you recognize political bias for what it is."

"And here's just a little proof of how the American government missed the boat with helping Fidel establish his fledgling democracy in Cuba, post revolution, and instead pushed him into the arms of the Soviet Union and communism when they deserted him. That's right... Fidel originally wanted democracy for Cuba, but alas, that was not to be. Sorry for the bad sound quality.... but it was 1959 in a war zone at 2:00am in the morning.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjpnfDwWd7YThere are other similar interviews with Fidel during the many days of the revolution where he also insisted that he wanted democracy for Cuba. In honour of Fidel as part of his legacy, I wish the Cuban government would seriously take Fidel's wishes into consideration, and perhaps also use those videos as part of a campaign to move Cuba not only towards capitalism, but more towards democracy as well to honour their fallen commandante's original vision. And with the belated HELP of the US government in time... this time... as well.TerryEdited: 6:43 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"13sweetie: thanks, good article that provided an information point that I did not have. Do not assume I believe one should not read any article because it has political bias. Only recognize it as such. The majority of all our news sources have some bias. Just don't rely on any one of them as being gospel. Personally, I use CNN, Reuters, and AP as my primary sources of news from Cuba. They seem to be about as unbiased as can be. My opinion is based on knowing Patrick Oppmann from CNN, much reading of Marc Frank who represents Reuters, and once know the AP rep in Cuba who has since been reassigned to Mexico."

"@50, back in the day, when I lived on Trout Lake in North Bay, I could lie on my dock and watch the meteor shower. Where I live now it would require some planning and travel. Too much light pollution here. Yeah, it would be better in Cuba...."
Terry #48: the relationship of Cuba and the US is complex and fascinating to learn about. That period from the Triumph of the Revolucíon through the follow on from the missile crisis is especially so as it involves both expropriation of American's property and the Cold war with Russia. Far too complex to be summarized in a PhD thesis or one book. No conclusions can be drawn from one interview at one point in time.
"Ahhhhhh!! If only we could go back in time, Bob, and have things play out differently for Cuba. I have no doubts that Cuba would be a thriving democracy right now today. Perhaps still not exactly the type of democracy one knows of the USA, but perhaps even that would be a good thing too.Terry"
"Spunky @42 - UK hasn't had a socialist governing party for 10 years. France is centrist. I'm not sure which you mean as a ruling socialist government in Northern Ireland. NI political parties are mainly split by nationalists and unionists, rather than socialist/not socialist. The assembly was suspended for three years because of a disagreement between the power sharing leadership of the two most popular parties. They resumed this January.All that said, yes, when we switch governments from right to left, we don't switch off capitalism."

"@39 Bob_Michaels, there are definitions and then there are definitions. There are also more than one elements or “building blocks” which define capitalism or socialism or communism. Definitions can be given from the social point of view, economic (or socio-economic); political point of view, philosophical point of view. Philosophically, an individual who stands in the street asking for money may be a capitalist. It’s a known fact: many turn it into a profession. They control their means of production – they have a special set of clothes; a cardboard sign; a musical instrument etc. Are they capitalists?A tribe who lives in Amazon, makes and owns their own spears, catch fish and animals and exchange the catch with a neighboring tribe… They may not have paper money, but they are using coca leaves as money. Are they capitalists? If one clan/family within a tribe overtakes the dominating one, is this a “revolution”?The answers from the Marxism/Leninism standpoint (just like from the Cuban government standpoint) is “no, no and no”."
"Deebob we received allot of free upgrades and perks by placing the right gifts in the right hands (most of the gifts were from clients and stuff we no longer used). For the most part, we never paid for ocean view rooms and suites and had our table ready and waiting for us. We had allot of free special meals cooked for us (shrimp and the odd time lobster) and full bottles of bubbly, red wine and rum for the room and beach. Plus it was nice not having to wait in line at the bar and to have items available that others were told ""Sorry we no have"". Plus we never had an issue with bottled water, toilet paper or, towels in our room. Keep in mind we are not as social as you are and wanted to have our holiday the way we wanted it to be (stress free and effortless). The means to do this are all gone and of course our desires are different. Being honest lets just say I don't give the same kind of sh*t that I used to and if Neil and I get to go on another vacation it will be all about us big time. Most of the things I cared about, I don't anymore. I am quite capable of walking into a Kitchen or behind a bar to help myself and know exactly how to handle lazy F. heads. Keep in mind we went to Cuba for the beaches and holiday experience; not for Friendship."
"@ 61,Heck of an attitude you had there, I've never been much of a gift giver, tips for sure, but I wouldn't have the balls to expect anything like you describe in return."
Otherwise known as bribery. Glad you are not travelling anytime me soon. Your not friend.
Post 61. At least you admit you are bribing them to give you a better time.Shame on you .
"@64, lots of people do the same, good on her for being honest about it as she always has. I know few people who don't take advantage of ""freebees"", regardless of why they are offered. I've receive free upgrades on the basis of sending a pleasant email to tell the resort I am looking forward to coming there. No, I did not request the upgrade or offer anything for it, yes, I sometimes expressed my appreciation after the fact (known as ""tipping""). Bottom line, friendship can also be a ""gift"" that is appreciated and sometimes rewarded in a substantial manner, plus especially if one travels in low season it is simply good PR to offer a free upgrade. Costs them nothing and results in a satisfied guest who is likely to recommend the resort."
"Even the avatar is expecting something :) Yes indeed Diva...shame on them. I can't believe they're Canadian...I feel like apologizing :) Never did like that keyboard much, or the avatar :)"
"Sorry to follow that one eeeefarm...mind you, that was way more Canadian :)"
"Years ago we stayed at a resort where a few Canadians ""held court"" over the bar area, freely walking behind and pouring themselves drinks. We were mortified at the nerve of them. We were embarrassed to be from the same country."
"One thing I like about Loraine, is her honesty, she always adds a little extra to her posts...lol"
"Come to think about it, we have never been given an upgrade, extra anything....must be doing something wrong,"
"@70, I think it might be a little more difficult these days, since they now get so many e-mail requests for room location, etc. Once upon a time you could send a polite e-mail to indicate where you would ideally like to be (not an upgrade, just an area of the resort, e.g. upstairs, quiet location, ideally near the beach) and more often than not in low season you would get an upgrade if there were few guests. At the very least, you would receive something in the area of your choice. I would suggest it is in everyone's best interest to be initially located where you prefer to be, makes it a lot easier for the front desk if multiple people aren't returning to complain about their room. Someone with a disability does not want the furthest room from the buffet, and someone like me does not want to be beside the disco! But I have no problem walking to the most remote room at the resort. Repeat guests DO often receive free upgrades, at least in low season. Playa Blanca used to have a policy for returning guests....upgrade plus free late check out....which I think they discontinued when there were so many repeaters it was no longer practical to offer it. Bottom line, if you are pleasant and show appreciation, and if anything is wrong you don't go ballistic but understand the limitations of what can be done to correct things, you will gain a reputation as someone they might want to reward when possible. Tips don't hurt, either. Bribes are another topic, but of course we are quite willing to pay extra for perks when it is the tour operator we are ""bribing"" (otherwise known as money for upgrades, just paid to a Canadian company instead of direct to a Cuban. Perception is everything!). ;-)"
"I’m a room/view person, that is my priority, everything else is after that, always has been. I’ve been very lucky that way, usually my request is granted, or else they get tired of my emails...lol. So, I rarely have anything to complain about."
"With only 24 visits to Cuba out of 51 All Inclusive vacations; which is a sip of the glass compared to many of you here. I had to learn fast how it was done and was shown by the best.

I never could afford to tip big and as much as most of you, so learned fast how to do it other ways. Plus it helped too for the most part I get along very well with most of the hotel Staff.

"@loraine - You have what is called ""The Courage of your Convictions."""
"My experience is not from resorts as that is not our thing. However, I and we have stayed in various casas and once or twice a year in a boutique hotel in Gibara. My wife, who is Cuban, has accompanied me most of the time for the last six years. We never give gifts and leave moderate tips when dining or drinking. Simply treating Cubans, honestly not artificially, as real equals while asking nothing that you would deem inappropriate of them asking of you has always worked wonders. Dealing with them on the same basis you would deal with a visiting family member in your own home has magical results. Asking them ""Can I help you?"" is a key that opens so many doors. The service and favors we get are incredible."
"Ditto Bob. Offering to help is always the way to bridge people together. It should never be a case of... I'll do this for you, if you do this for me. Trusting in human nature has never gone out of style, nor should it. That human quality can be applied to so many different scenarios involving Cuba too... if you follow my drift. Just scale it up is all that's required. Terry"
"Loraine/Sweetmystery has described exactly what many Canadians did for years. Santa sacks of goods from home in return for perks and upgrades. If we check the Facebook fan pages for many resorts there are almost always requests for gifts from staff. By example, the responses from UK visitors to a certain Melia, to anyone who suggests other, are rather nasty and can get you thrown out of the group. I have experienced similar responses from other fan club groups.Edited: 9:16 pm, August 12, 2020 "

"I remember back in the day ( mid 70's to mid 80's ? ) when the "" Cuban offshore fishing fleet "" ( Soviet vessels , Cuban flagged ) , used to arrive into a port just a short drive from where I lived on their way back home to Cuba. It was almost like spring cleanup time ! People would either set out, or bring their things down to the wharf where the  ""Cuban "" boats were tied up at the time. Bicycles ,old refrigerators , freezers, car parts, radios, stereos, etc., all kinds of things, I even saw an old car being pushed down to the wharf and lifted aboard the vessel using their crane one time. Even in those days ( when Cuba was being propped up by the USSR ) they still wanted almost any and everything that we didn't use any more. As one Cuban told me, ""if this refrigerator doesn't work, and that one doesn't work, I think I can make one work out of both of them."" Very resilient people , that's for sure.Is this where ' gifting ' started ? Maybe, maybe not, but it was certainly fun times when the Cubans arrived !Edited: 10:06 pm, August 12, 2020 "
Probably better than tossing them in to the land fill
Nice storytelling SW and Yahez. Really vivid imagery.Nicely put guys. A simple how are you? or what’s new in? or just hello! makes your time spent in a beautiful country so much richer. This will be especially true during this tragic painful time for us all across the globe.
"Maybe we should start a short story thread :) I enjoyed those stories too...it was like they gifted themselves and spring cleaning SW :) YaHez, you sound a lot like me except for the tipping part :) I would think we'd have at least a ""Hola, what a day"" exchange, then maybe a US$ exchange, then ""yes it is a good day isn't it"" exchange...then the final short shake and smile exchange :)"
"To say I have been going through some very challenging times is an understatement. It did not help that I had trouble with my account and had to sign in with Facebook (yes gave in and am doing Facebook). The daft thing is I came here to connect, feel better and gather some hope, but only to really see that because I would not conform to the way the majority of this group preached, well I am hated by most.Hey that is okay because the reality is Neil and I have many dream like vacations, they kept us going and inspired to create more. We also know for a fact that there are many people who do gift and its not dollar store items either; like I said I learned from the best. Main point I will make is no matter where you live, not matter how much money you make, when you go on a vacation to an All Inclusive resort, we are all on equal playing ground. It really does depend on how you research, how you treat the Staff and what is important to you. In Cuba Hubby and I have only transferred out of two hotels and in both cases we were moved to better hotels, with upgrades and it did not cost us a thing. Like I said the right words and gift, in the right hands at the right place make the difference between getting issues resolved swiftly. Also the Cubans work at hotels to get your money and gifts; they don't go to work for your Friendship; what ego's to think that or, huge suckers."
"I don’t care what anyone says, I’m glad you’re back posting...miss you when your not, and appreciate your honest posts. Staff are friendly with you, because that’s their job, and they want to make a few extra bucks...can’t blame them, that’s what puts food on the table. Our idea of travelling is the same as yours, not there to make friends, we are just there to vacation. Treat the staff with respect, show we appreciate them, and that’s it."
You cannot use US$ in Cuba - have you ever been there? Take Canadian money and convert it to CUC.
Post 88.Your information is wrong. Read up on your information before you state it as fact.
"Picha2:>>>Take Canadian money and convert it to CUC<<<Whilst that's still true for Canadians, things have changed with regard to US dollars since you last posted. There is no longer a 10% surcharge on US currency and many Cubans are looking for US dollars now."
"Lori, I agree with your firm forum @ 87 :) I also like the new inviting voucher reminding avatar :)Picha, you can use US$ like never before right now. Actually it's a gift to you and them if asap you visit Cuba with as much US$ as you can, exchange sidewalk style for the Cuc dream deal vacation of your life...it's like you're the banker, never mind their Bank/Airport ripoff rates :) It's like a two way Canadian style give and receive dream gift :)"
"Slightly off topic, the wife and I learnt many years ago to take a good supply of chocolate bars [mainly what we call Mars Bars in the UK] where ever we went in the world on package holidays. These were not for the general staff of the hotel etc but for the holiday reps. They were then mainly Brits who had spent their summer devoid of home treats, and you could get extra help and attention from many a rep with such a simple gift! Ray"
"@92, most everyone likes chocolate. I usually bring some and share it both with staff and other guests. Lately I have discovered that those little individually wrapped caramels are also a hit. And if I don't feel generous I can eat the treats myself! ;-)"
"Yes, I was taking some candy this trip. Had it all figured out what I was taking....oh well, I must of ate it...lol"
"I have a friend who every year has to re-buy Halloween candy because she can't prevent herself from eating it all. Wonder what she will do this year?A chocolate would probably do some grumpy bartenders good, sweeten them up a bit, but the people who really appreciate a piece of candy when I am out for my early morning walk are the security guards who have been up all night. Or the front desk staff who are just waiting to go home.....Desired chocolate? I like Reece's Peanut Butter Cups myself, so I usually take them.Edited: 3:12 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"Terry's chocolate orange, they like to tap( whack) it and unwrap it.They tend to react to the intense orange flavour."

"Yeah, people are talking, Richar. Funnily enough, I am losing weight. Not going out helps.Oh, great ideas! Bright and pretty chocs for security and front desk. Do you do anything special for the maid, no, I mean the housekeeping staff?Edited: 3:30 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"HolaI now put my Terry's chocolate orange balls and Cadbury Creme Eggs into my carry on...if not each and every time my luggage is flagged they think it is fruit. Still get pulled out to checked, my carry on but after so many stops they know my face...they have quick look and off I go...have been asked for the odd creme egg...have left a few with the old lady checking my carry on....like I said have eaten all of them...nowcheers."
"Hola Oceanblue @99Housekeeping staff - including those filling the room fridge - apart from the monetary tip - I usually add a couple of those mini chocolate bars (larger than the Halloween sized treats) - you know the kind that come in a pack of 10 at the (dare I say it....dollar store....lol) - Kit Kat, Coffee Crisp, Aero, Mars, Snickers.... Enough variety that the receiver doesn't know what each day is going to bring, lol!!!Cheers"
"One more thing, what the crap are we doing here in BC? We had HIGHER daily numbers than Ontario yesterday! 85? Cut it out kids!"
"Meanwhile, here in Nova Scotia, we have no active cases. I guess that we are too busy enjoying life on our 10,000 km of coastline, with easy access to local sources of fish and farm products. And beer! Did I tell you about our local craft breweries? There’s enough to keep drg & Santiago satiated, to say the least.That said; we are happy to keep our borders closed outside of our “Atlantic Bubble"". We have so many gifts to share … when the time is right. Which isn’t now."
"Right you are, Mad! I love your coastline and hospitality. I took the train across at 20 and fell in love with the Atlantic. So ocean smelly and wild. Hats off to our friends in the Bubble.I will enjoy BC craft, with my Covid."
Be careful Mad. There is a COVIDIOT running around in your bubble!https:/…axuXc2g
I recon they’re livin right over there . One day we’ll get there and see what all the Fuss is about!
"Oh, thanks for that, #106, thanks for rubbing it in. A woman from British Columbia fails to self-isolate, gets drunk, infects a bunch of do-gooding east coasters.Sorry."
"Mad,Does this mean that one cannot enter and move into Nova Scotia from another Province?"
"Loraine.., The Atlantic Bubble is New Brunswick, PEI , NFLD Labrador , and NS. We can all move freely between provinces but for someone who lives outside the Bubble they must quarantine for 14 days when entering NS."
I think the small number of recent cases in NB were all discovered during the 14 day quarantine period. Shows it works.
"Loraine, you can come out west. No restrictions in place. Don’t even need to mask it. We even have drum circle parties where Covid is freely distributed. It’s working here too. Not."
"Thank you SW Nova and Spunky. Once house sells, we hope to have the option to head in that direction if we cannot find something within a tight budget here. I crave the Ocean something fierce. Oh to smell that salt breeze and to feel that Ocean spray."
