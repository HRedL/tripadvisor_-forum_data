"Is there any travel advisory from the government or airlines regarding the virus?I am planning to travel to Prague, Vienna and Budapest this coming May. I am asking because I've heard all planes coming from Asia cannot land in Italy. Also in Italy, an Asian tourist guy was beaten just because apparently the suspect is mad about the virus and comes from China.I am Asian coming and residing from USA. Do I need to worry?"
no. there no issue in Czech Rep
We are in the same boat. Keep checking we will decide in 2 weeks wo cancel or not. We are also going to Italy.
"frankly, while it is not a problem here at this time, since the coronavirus seems to have 2-4 weeks incubation period, i would proly cancel any foreign holiday i have planned for next couple months :( there are pretty much daily new cases in europe (and pretty much all over the world), even tho europe was almost coronavirus free 2 weeks ago"
"Love Trip Advisor but this is not an authoritative source for public health issues. We are cancelling our trip to Prague next month, unfortunately. The risk of getting sick, being quarantined, etc., is too high. The virus is clearly spreading within Europe. It's too bad as we were very much looking forward to it."
"Personally, I think it's way overblown. One has a far, far greater chance of getting the flu..."
"At this point, panic is much bigger threat than the actual disease. It's business as usual - I myself have several trips planned this week to cities (outside Czechia) where Covid-19 has been detected. I have zero worries and plan to take those trips as planned.There are far bigger risks when travelling than this.Also, I think it's a bit naive to expect that staying at home will somehow save me from exposure. The reality is that virus is currently likely to eventually appear all over the world.Edited: 5:02 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"It's probably the safest time to fly. China is on lockdown, so you aren't going to run into 1000's of travelers from the 'hot zone.' ...Get a DUS-T shirt with the defender treatment, if you are really worried, and wear it on the plane and airports.http://www.dus-tshirt.com/products.html"
"BlueRidgeTourist, I live in Prague. I watch the news I read the papers and I get virus news alerts and I post here, I am not an authoritative source for public health issues but it looks better here than it does in Virginia :-)"
"as of today 28 FebruaryAs the number of COVID-19 infections continues to rise in Europe, the Czech government is increasing precautions. At a press briefing on Thursday Health Minister Adam Vojtěch stressed that as of yet there are no confirmed cases of the virus in the Czech Republic and urged citizens not to give way to panic. ...https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/do…"
"Don’t cancel. More people are affected by the everyday flu than this virus. I’m travelling and going to Prague next week. Be sensible, wash hands well, use antiseptic wipes etc The press are partially to be blame for the hype and scare factor of the public."
A totally sensible answer. I’m travelling next week to Prague and won’t be cancelling.
"The WHO and CDC will make it seem as if there is a zombie apocalypse, because they want $..."
I’m heading there in a couple of weeks. I’m not concerned at all but I will take hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes. I’ve got an Air Korea flight on hold (as overnighting in South Korea disqualifies for entry to some countries I want to visit) and now have a Qatar Airlines flight. Any ideas for what to do with my Air Korea flight without incurring the cancellation penalty?
Call Air Korea...
"Actually, this press releaseTicket Change/Refund Guideline for COVID-19 (as of Feb 28)states the penalty is waived...https:/…_"
Arriving tomorrow for 15 nights..can't wait to get there
Personally I am travelling in 2 weeks to Prague and will not cancel unless forced to you could get it in Prague but you could also get it by staying where you are
"Have a good trip, Matt. I'm heading to Prague in May. I've no intention of cancelling, even if there are cases there by then. Unless EasyJet cancels my flight I will be going. Cannot wait, not been to Prague since 2006!"

Go. Enjoy your trip!I will be traveling to Switzerland & Italy in May and Prague in June. I can’t imagine cancelling. I believe the media is responsible for sensationalizing this issue.
"The 3 cases are from Czechs who had traveled to N. Italy and quarantined when they arrived back. Even so, how many cases of the flu are there in just Prague? 20000+..."
"I think that we need to get this into proportion. This winter alone, 15,000 people in the UK have died from normal flu related illnesses. I'm on oral chemotherapy but refuse to panic or cancel a trip to Prague. Much more likely to catch it in London!! Just be sensible and wash hands etc. Masks are useless,"
"""Go. Enjoy your trip!I will be traveling to Switzerland & Italy in May and Prague in June. I can’t imagine cancelling.I believe the media is responsible for sensationalizing this issue.""It's not really a problem about sensationalizing. The problem for tourists is if governments start believing it's prudent to start closing attractions, museums, castles etc... and worse off if tourists start getting caught in quarantines for 14 days at a time, trains, buses stop, roadblocks are placed."
I heard that they closed the Castle in Prague??? We are flying in on Tuesday and not cancelling - the only thing that would get me to cancel is if they do what they have done in Israel and insisted people coming into the country self isolate for 14 days - then whats the point in going for the holiday which is only 4 days? But as this isnt happening we are going and will have as much fun as we can while keeping our hands washed (AS NORMAL)If anyone knows if any other attractions are closed - can you let me know?Thanks
"pretty much all attractions are closed (castles, museums, theaters etc)you can still walk the courtyards etc, but not to go inside buildingssame goes for e.g. vysehrad"
"still plenty to see.... the bridge, old town, the grounds, parks etcEdited: 9:01 am, March 11, 2020 "

"The only isolation coming in is if people come from a country that's a 'hot zone', like Italy or China, or Iran. If you have a fever and they check your temperature, I'm not sure what would happen..."
Im visiting Prague for 2 nights on 28th March is it still ok to plan to fly there and have enjoy a small break?
Where are you coming from?
"Any trip advisory for budapest,vienna and praque from usa"
Rommel are traveling with gate 1
"You are kidding, right? Prague and CR are closed. You can't fly in, take a train in, or bus, or car.."
All Gate 1 trips are cancelled thru April 30. Look at their web page .
So how's it going with the flu 4 weeks later?
