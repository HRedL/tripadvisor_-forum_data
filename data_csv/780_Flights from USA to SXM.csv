"And that cane change as conditions do in USA.Edited: 11:16 am, July 08, 2020 "
"Yes, subject to change, as usual."
"We're not alone. See rules changed all over, including the states. Close this, open that."
And that isn't going to change.
And back to step one.
"Stay safe all who live in US and on SXMI agree with Surf I regarding the rush/ full speed ahead to open everything I feel bad for teachers , students In the US who are told they must open up in the fallWhy rush the opening of establishments with numbers rising and some States are saying they have reached capacity in the hospitals I do have friends who live in US but I really hope our borders stay closedStay safe allEdited: 2:02 pm, July 08, 2020 "
Thx Surf for clarifying... I can’t keep up with what your leader says or plans to do
Lets keep politics and personal opinions out of this and stick to St Maarten.

"Pirate, Sunny and Surf. I couldn't agree with you more.Whether or not those in the US wish to acknowledge it, the absence of a consistent and co-ordinated, medically-led, national policy in the US during this pandemic is a significant part of the problem, and not just for the US. It is also a significant contributor to why the current travel issues are so exacerbated for the rest of the world. Normally, political actions have little effect on travel, short of perhaps a closure of borders or introduction of new visa requirements. These are far from normal times. The problem is less about politics and more about an intellectual propensity to regularly disagree with much of the rest of the world, together with a tendency to downplay the issues and pooh-pooh the advice of medical experts. That is not the case in most other locations, including SXM. But it has an impact on all those other countries, including SXM. So for everyone to have to pussy-foot around the issue is in fact part of the problem. No one wants to bell the cat.It has a direct impact on when or if international travel might have a chance to return to something resembling normal anytime soon and whether or not economies might be allowed to flourish. That has a direct impact on when smaller nations like SXM, whose economies rely heavily on tourism, can reopen. It is therefore a ""travel"" issue, unlike one we have ever before seen. That is why it is a topic on so many fora.Countries like SXM are desperately trying to find a way to balance protecting the lives and safety of both their citizens and visitors, while opening up their country and economy. The fact Covid-19 is still raging through the USA, which is such a huge part of international tourism, also contributes to the complexity of finding that balance and the cost of keeping everyone safe.Please, let's not brush all these considerations and concerns aside, and therefore ignore them, by resorting to dragging out the old name-calling trope of calling them ""political"". We are better than that!"

"Well written Post CanuckThanks for sharing your opinionEdited: 6:07 pm, July 09, 2020 "
"Thanks @Canadasunny53. Much appreciated.@Surf: Yes, we know. So does that mean you are volunteering? LOL!"
"Thanks, PP. I'm in your exact place. I, too, have placed a deposit for my 12/20 B&B in Grand Case. Patience and Faith are the only tools I have, waiting for the COVID-19 restrictions to be worked out."
hope we can welcome you all soon. We all just want this to be over.
"I booked my flight from JFK to SXM with American Airlines for August 8 - August 22. Hopeful for no cancellation, looking to propose on August 13"
Thank you @surf I will definitely keep everyone updated if American cancels my flight and any next steps. OMG I actually live at a co-op here in Oakland gardens haha small world. Things have changed so much in this neighborhood.
"We had a week planned for SXM in Feb but COVID did its thing. We were able to get our airline miles back, but only have a certificate for our one week resort stay. Truly worried on when we are going to be able to use.Have seen so much misinformation with COVID on the new and that is sad. Too much politics and not enough common sense. The rise in COVED cases is very expected & most or the younger peop;e who will have little problem. Truly most countries want the younger adults & even the children to get this and get over it. The Heard effect kicks in. Lots of the new cases are those asymptomatic & the more the better. Many finding are coming from those who came away positive but fully over it. The taking heads onmost of our US news are truly doing no one any good with the hyper reporting. Taling numbers with out relaying the outlying issues."
"@DonDory: ""Truly most countries want the younger adults & even the children to get this and get over it. The Heard [sic] effect kicks in.""Not sure where you heard this? Is this the ""heard"" effect to which you refer?I have so far not ""heard"" anyone from the St. Martin forums (at least until you came along), nor anyone in my own country, seriously pushing this idea!! In fact, the government in St. Martin and most other countries seem to be doing everything in their power to ensure as few people as possible are exposed to or contract Covid-19, whether residents or tourists.We are a long, long way (and many deaths in the interim) from having a large enough percentage of the population (60 to 80%) infected, to be even close to being able to rely on herd immunity. Also, since this is a new type of virus there is no proof yet that herd immunity will even work.It sounds more to me like what you are saying is ""we're young and therefore think we are immune from most of the ramifications of getting Covid-19, so just let the older people get infected and die, so we can get back to doing whatever we want, whenever we want!"" Did I understand you correctly? If so...unbelievable!Edited: 2:25 pm, July 19, 2020 "

They are requiring the Americans to do Covid-19 tests within 72 hours of flying to the Caribbean. Won't that be enough?
"While the testing requirement is good, you can still catch the virus in the 72 hours between getting the test and getting to the airport. Also, totally possible to catch it at the airport. The good news is the testing requirement is an impediment in itself because people are going to have a hard time getting a test and results in that timeframe."
"Yes that is correct it is taking a long time to get results. And in this case I did my covid test and still waiting on results. If I don’t get results in time, can I pay for a test when I reach to St. Maarten?"
"If you don't have test results, you will not be allowed on the plane, or if they miss you leaving they will put you back on the plane when you arrive.I've posted this before, but in any case, here's the requirements for entry: https://stmaartenupdates.com/#RequirementsEdited: 9:19 am, July 30, 2020 "
"That’s crazy in the sense that you have done the test in advance and still don’t have results. My best friend works for JetBlue and she said they do not check for covid tests. Maybe other airlines, not sure."
Requirements and protocols could change too.https:/…reopening-to-us-still-on-for-aug-1
