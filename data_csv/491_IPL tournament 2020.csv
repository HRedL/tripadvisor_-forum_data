Hi we are looking to visit Chennai from the UK in April this year. We are hoping to get to at least one if not more IPL games. Can anyone please advise if we will be able to buy tickets easily when we arrive - or if there is a facility to pre buy and have delivered to our hotel. Also can anyone advise when the schedule is expected. Many Thanks Debbie
Schedule of matches will be announced in Jan or February you could buy tickets online or a few days before the match at stadium counter but long queue will be there
"Debbie, I don't mean to assume ignorance on your part, but just want to put it out there that Chennai in April & May will be a sauna. But then I generally don't like humid weather (so for me most of SE Asia is an uncomfortable region weather wise, and enticing in other ways) and Chennai is worse than most places at that time."
Hi Thank you for this I shall bear this in mind when looking forIPL venues to watch Debbie
"Chennai is a humid place so there will be lot of sweating for sure during IPL season lol. If that's not an option, then look for IPL matches in Bangalore, near by. It may be as hot, but much less humid. Tickets will be available online (BookmyShow.com and few other websites). The schedule is not yet out (https://www.iplt20.com), but it is expected to start from 29 March 2020. Buying tickets at stadium needs lot of patience (long queus) and is time consuming, including facing the heat. Check if there are tickets for air conditioned boxes are avaiable which might make it a more pleasant experience. By the way, do you support any particular team? (Chennai Super Kings I hope :) )"
"Hi - Thank you for the update. Our Son is the CSK fan, due to North East of England connection with Ben Stokes myself and Husband are supporting Rajasthan Royals this year - and hope to be fortunate enough to take in a few games in Rajasthan"
"I am also travelling to India from the UK to watch Chennai.I will be using Goa as my base.Will travel to Mumbai,Delhi and Chennai for the matches.I have booked flights and hotels,but am a little worried about getting tickets.i fly out on the 19th of March and was hoping to have the tickets waiting at the hotels for me"
"Hi - The fixtures haven't been released as far as I'm aware as yet. I believe the Tournament begins March 29th with an ""All stars"" game being played 3 days previous. I wish they would release fixtures in order we can book flights from the UK"
A friend forwarded this link . . . . . not sure if it is authentic though . . . .https:/…vivo_ipl_2020_schedule
Hi Thank you I saw this - but the text before it mentioned anticipated schedule which put me off as I know some teams are looking to play a few games at different venues. We went to watch IPL 2017 and booked our plane tickets on the strength of it - then they changed 2 venues and we ended up having to cancel 6 internal flights costing hundreds of pounds as air India and Spice jet would not allow us to change routes. Please be wary of this
They were confirmed on the 28th
"Considering the last three year's schedule, you can expect this year's IPL also to held somewhere from 1st Week of April to last or second last week of May. So, my suggestions for you would be to plan your visit to Chennai for Mid April (10th to 15th). Coming to Ticket Booking, usually Tickets are made available at www.bookmyshow.com once the match fixture is declared. So, keep checking the website for updates. Purchasing ticket from ticket window can be quite troublesome for your, not only because of long lines but also due to high humid temperature during April month.The Wikipedia page shows that the final is more likely to be held on 24th May 2020 (Sunday). Considering the final match date, you can expect the opening of this year's IPL between 3rd to 5th April 2020.Do let me know if you need further assistance.Thanks"
Thank you

Due to Covid-19 outbreak IPL postponed to April 15th 2020 from original schedule March 29th
IPL 2020 may not happen at all. Which would be a sad end to a most popular cricketer for the Chennai fans.
"Ipl won't now happen before October, maybe not even then due to international fixtures."

IPL Schedule 2020
"Could Virat Kohli be replaced as RCB skipper? Franchise chairman addresses speculation over team captaincy  Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) squad has reached UAE to start the preparations for the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 season. The functioning of the team in the last couple of seasons has been so gloomy that many have asked franchise skipper Virat Kohli to be replaced by someone else. RCB Chairman Sanjeev Churiwala was asked about the same during a recent media conference where he put an end to the speculation once and for all.The past few seasons have seen RCB finish at 8th, 6th, and 8th place in the league, thus neglecting to qualify for playoffs. Be it that the overall team combination, performances of individuals, or captaincy decisions, several elements of their game have been questioned. With Kohli being the captain, the team is expected to be hard at the absolute top, but that hasn't been the situation of late.https://www.ipl2020center.com/IPL 2020 Time table, update's, Time, Teams venue, live streaming Channels List"
