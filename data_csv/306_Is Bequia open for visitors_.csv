The SV.gov website is terrible. Any news on when international visitors will be welcome from Canada and the US?
"Hi Davolrie---American Airlines int'l flights begin july 6th. that doesn't mean they will be going to SVG. try the link below. It has lots of info regarding your question plus other goings on. i had to cancel my flight to SVG/Bequia for a trip in May of this year. and until SVG opens up, I'll have to wait to rebook when it does. but who knows when that will be...https://www.begos.com/Edited: 10:13 am, June 17, 2020 "
"SVG isnâ€™t closed, but there is a mandatory 14 day quarantine for all visitors. There are 29 reported cases presently."
"@potomac1963 I'm aware of the current quarantine, but I heard that as of June 22nd that will no longer be in place. That they would be taking temperatures at the airport and only quarantining those that have a fever. That's what I'm trying to figure out."
"Hi. Where did you see that Davolrie ? There were 2 new COVID positive tests from returning cruiseship crew this week, so I'd be very surprised if they are planning to stand down the quarantine requirement soon. Current status is 29 cases of which 25 have recovered so 4 active."
"Given the situation in the US..... Really!!!From one pariah country to another.Edited: 7:01 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"We were originally booked for 2 weeks in May. Rescheduled that to 2 weeks beginning July 9. Rescheduled that to 2 weeks in April, 2021. With restrictions in place and no official re-entry announcement, we felt this was our best option. Hoping for clear information soon, but as things are, that is a big issue and there is no clear solution. Especially coming from Texas were the contagion risk is very high, now nearing the original peak in April."
"So, I have new information from the Corona Virus Task Force in St Vincent. The CURRENT policy is a two week quarantine - would suck for people on a 2 week vacation. New entry protocols will come into effect on July 1st. The announcement will be made on June 23rd at the latest. Essentially the new protocol would allow for sample collection on entry, a PCR (Swab) test and a 24 hour quarantine until results are received.The Corona Virus Task Force was actually very helpful."
"We are booked on AA July 11th to the 25th. The Wed flights seem to be scaled back , but the saturday flights are there. I had to fish around for the best fare, but they are there to grab!"
Davo- About 20 minutes ago there was a post of the Facebook page Discover St. Vincent and the Grenadines outlining the entry procedures in place during August. I'd love to hear feedback on how your entry goes. Are you flying direct into St Vincent?
SVG Government posted new process details this afternoon. I can find it on Facebook in Bequia What's On.
"II apologise if this offends anyone's sense of freedom but it's only a single test and they can give false negatives so the possibility exists that you could, unwittingly, take Covid into SVG. If you really care about the islands and want to support them send money to the people and businesses you care about."
"Hello Davo,What are the regulations for returning to the U.S. after visiting Bequia?Is there a quarantine period upon return?Thanks"
"Given the rapidly growing number of COVID cases in the US, S America and elsewhere, I'd hope SVG govt thinks very carefully about opening its borders to anyone other than the designated ""bubble"" countries in the near future. They have done well to contain infection so far, be dreadful if it were to take hold now."
"The question is whether SVG wants to kill their economy for a virus that is carried by less than 1% of the population (even in the 'high risk' countries.) SVG will test twice to eliminate that less than 1% chance a visitor is carrying it. People cannot just stop living for a year waiting for a virus to disappear, and by January 1, 2021, there will still be about 80 million more people on this planet than the beginning of 2020, despite COVID."
"Of course the reactivation of the tourist economy is vital but the country has to weigh that up against the resources it has available to test, trace, isolate and if necessary, treat incoming tourists. Assuming your figure of 1% that carry the virus, over the course of a 'normal' season that would represent around 1000 people, excluding those from cruise ships which is probably the same again, Kingstown hospital has 215 beds including 20 intensive care. So the issue is how to balance the economics with the need to protect its citizens and prevent its health resources being overwhelmed."
"And the figure of 1% is really more like 10%, at least according to the CDC in the US (and other sources that I have read) that actual cases are 10 times the ""confirmed cases"" numbers. So caution is definitely warranted, but on the other hand the world will never be risk-free and life (including commerce) must go on.at some point."
"Meantime, the very good news is that as of today SVG is COVID free."
"We were originally schedule for our first visit in May, thought maybe to re-schedule in July, and now have postponed to next April. Hopefully this timeframe creates a new ""normal"" for locals and tourists alike. Our decision was based on fellow TA contributors so thanks to all and just maybe...... we can ""toast"" to our good fortune to be on island. Mahalo nui loa..."
Our plans mirror yours exactly. Truly hoping next spring will work out!
"This American airline flight to ST Vincent had six people who tested positive for Covid 19. Every person on the plane was exposed to the virus. People were leaving the airport in Taxis. Some people took the ferry to Bequia. Some people also did not quarantine or are quarantining in homes with family members. Also this flight departed out of Miami. There were over 15,000 new cases of the virus in Florida. Why would people go on vacation now? Why travel thru such a hot spot. This virus is out of control in Florida, Texas etc etc."
"These were not people going on vacation. The vast majority on this flight, and all those infected, were returning Vincentians."
"Bear--no way is it 10%, except maybe in NY nursing homes. Hospitals are coding everything Covid....even with other main causes. Protect seniors but reopen. Be safe."
"If I am reading the figures correctly, assuming both flights were full, 21 positive cases suggests nearly 7% of incoming passengers tested positive.Edited: 3:53 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"IrishFan: No way what is 10%?!? I never said anything about 10% of anything. I said the people on the flight were Vincentians, not tourists."
"Sorry IrishFan, I see that you were referring to my comment from way back--didn't realize it was in this same post. Yes, in fact many studies and, as I said, the CDC supports these findings, show that actual cases are around 10 times the number of confirmed cases in many jurisdictions. This has nothing to do with hospitals coding anything. It is simply that the vast majority of people have not been tested and never know that they had the virus. Obviously, these are people who did not get very sick, but can still infect other people, and that is the problem. These studies tested people after the fact for the presence of antibodies, which indicates that they had been infected at some point."
Uhhh....#16....10%. Be safe.
"the protocol changes from week to week. Arrivals currently have to have a negative COVID test done within 5 days of travel....100 people were not able to board the AA flight from Miami Saturday the 25th as their test results had not come in...the arriving passengers are all in 5 day quarantine in hotels at their expense...depending on how this works out and if there are more cases from this last flight, they may cancel future flights until the situation in the US improves,..there was an Air Canada flight last thursday and I understand that those passengers were allowed to quarantine for 5 days at their own home or booked accommodations..."
"after the 5 day quarantine in an approved hotel/guest house/etc. then you have to quarantine for another 9 - 16 days...if you plan on a two week vacation, it will be spent in quarantine...if you test positive then that's going to change the equation as you'll have to stay until you are well, and you might end up in the government facility for quarantine..."
