Local source says Two Medicine area is slated to be open by July 1st!
Do you have a link?
"Someone just asked the following question earlier today (in the comments about fireworks) on the ""Blackfeet Covid-19 Incident Command"" Facebook page.""So, still wanting to go to glacier, have u opened back up for travel? Needing to know if we should still cancel our reservations at East glacier.""The answer was:""Blackfeet Covid-19 Incident Command The public will be updated when the Blackfeet Tribe Business Council makes a decision, by June 30, 2020. Subscribe to our page for the latest updates. Thank you!""https:/…Deb"
"Looks like they're opening, don't need to wait for the announcement!"
"Henry D, do you have a credible source or is this just speculation and wishful thinking?"
No one knows. Nothing on their website or facebook page. I think its all just speculation for now !!
"July 1 is the default date for the east side entrances opening if the Blackfeet don’t extend their closure.Until then, I consider the date tentative until we get official word from the Blackfeet and GNP."
"I read that as July 1 we'll let you know what the plan is. With Covid cases continuing to rise around the country, I would not be surprised if they keep the border closed."
"So to summarize, this topic title is clickbait and basically fake news."
I wouldn’t be surprised if it stays closed with increasing COVID amongst many states.
"On one hand, the concern is allowing COVID to gain any sort of foothold in the Reservation, so I understand the hard-line stance against travel through the Reservation for visitors. On the other hand, It seems like some sort of compromise could be reached involving, say, payout or profit sharing with private entities within the park (namely from Xanterra lodges in Many Glacier) in return for allowing limited access from St. Mary to Many Glacier and back, perhaps only available to folks that have reservations within the lodges, and no stopping permitted en route except inside park boundaries. It's about 15 miles of road, we're talking about, and they could use guide cars like construction crews do all the time out west; you line up and wait and then go once the lead vehicle says it's time to move.Edited: 1:49 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"Thank you, Mountaingerbil. We are a senior couple and have reservations in Many Glacier on July 1st. We have never been to Glacier and this is our only opportunity. At our age, we feel vulnerable to COVID and empathize with the Blackfeet community, but we also love the beauty of nature and wish to visit with family in the area - a military son who recently returned from a long deployment. We wear masks and follow all COVID procedures. We only wish to drive from St Mary's to the Many Glacier entrance without stopping. Please consider opening the east road. Thank you. God Bless."
"To be clear, I have no inside knowledge or connections. I'm merely thinking out loud, and would be curious to know what the ""cooperation"" efforts are that the NPS and Blackfeet have been discussing regarding possibly making the East Side accessible."
"Until we get any OFFICIAL notification...everything is speculation. As you know, committee meetings tend to last and last and last without decisions. Regardless of how briefly a car would be on the road...the Blackfeet are very aware of Covid and the toll it can take on its population. Many of them live or herd cattle just off of those roads although visitors may not notice that driving through. The Blackfeet have many of those secondary health issues that make the risk of Covid deadly. And they live far from any hospitals prepared with the staff, equipment and room to segregate Covid from Non-Covid patients. Their meetings are private so they can talk freely. We have no idea what has or has not been said. Offering them payment may not alleviate the real and justified fear they do have about Covid. We will see...eventually we will hear OFFICIALLY. So far we have not.Edited: 3:29 pm, June 23, 2020 "
I had a reservation set for St. Mary's in early July. I got an email today saying that my reservation had been cancelled. I called the park and they said that all St. Mary's reservations have been cancelled through July 9th and that at least through July 9th no hiking in the eastern half the park will be allowed.
"Mary Ellen, you realize you can't catch COVID while you're driving right? And similarly, someone standing in a field next to a highway isn't going to catch it either. Your understanding of this disease is lacking"
"Henry D, Obviously, driving through has been an ongoing concern with the Blackfeet Nation. I never plan to have car trouble or a flat tire, yet they happen. Waiting on the official announcement is the wisest course of action. Speculation that it is about money serves no purpose."
"Whatever the Blackfeet Nation decides, I am fine with it. However, I wish they make decision one way or another sooner rather than later. That would help out of state visitors with planning purposes."
"Henry D, you’re the guy who made the original misleading (and false) post about the area reopening on July 1. Might want to think twice before commenting on someone else “lacking” understanding about anything.Edited: 11:48 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"Cecilia,I definitely agree. With all the reports of increasing cases and hospitalizations of COVID cases, I went ahead and made back up plans. I just have a bad feeling they will not allow the east side to reopen, but I just wish they would confirm one way or the other. I worked so hard to get my hotels reserved and was so excited to finally get to stay in the Many Glacier hotel. Oh well...we will just have to wait and see."
Is it false yet?
Well here’s the update we’ve all been waiting for. The East is closed for the remainder of the summer season: https:/…
"Wow. I held out until the last minute, because I was just sure they couldn't take the financial hit of staying closed for the entire season. Now I get to start seeing whether I can cancel the whole trip, or whether I will have to just find other things to see in Montana/Idaho. I am so disappointed, and I know the business community out there is just devastated."
"The Facebook post will get pushed down on the Blackfeet Covid-19 Incident Command page so I copied the release in it's entirety.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:WHEREAS, The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council passed the “Blackfeet Tribe COVID-19 Ordinance” No. 121 and Resolution No. 2020-181 “ Reaffirming the Declaration Addressing the COVID-19 Outbreak for the Blackfeet Reservation” and further orders for the purpose of limiting the risk of infection from the global pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 to members and residents of the Blackfeet Reservation, andWHEREAS, Based on the spike in COVID-19 cases in Montana and the health and safety risk to the residents of the Blackfeet Reservation have high numbers of health disparities, the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council hereby desires to close the eastern border of Glacier National Park for the protection of the residents of the Blackfeet Reservation for the rest of the 2020 tourism season, nowTHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:1. Closure of the Eastern Border of Glacier National Park. The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council hereby closes the Eastern Border of Glacier National Park into the Blackfeet Reservation including all the following roads: Two Medicine, Chief Mountain, St. Mary’s, Cut Bank Creek, and Many Glacier until end of the 2020 tourism season.2. Penalty. Violation of this resolution shall be subject to the penalties prescribed pursuant to Ordinance #121.3. Public Advertisement. The Public Relations Specialist is hereby directed to make notice effective immediately of this Resolution to the Public.Deb"
"I am disappointed but respect the Tribes decision. I was so much looking forward to the trip. This would have been my first visit to Glacier. The Tribe is being very cautious and as this virus is not going anywhere anytime soon, I will move the trip to 2022."
"This is disappointing, but I certainly understand and respect their decision."
Is it the just the east entrance or the entire east half of the park?
Whole east side is how I’m taking it.
"""The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council hereby closes the Eastern Border of Glacier National Park into the Blackfeet Reservation including all the following roads: Two Medicine, Chief Mountain, St. Mary’s, Cut Bank Creek, and Many Glacier until end of the 2020 tourism season.""I would wait for an update from GNP to see what is officially closed within the park."
Well that stinks. I think we will go ahead anyway. Already tried to do Banff and Alaska and had to cancel those. We are staying in Wbitefish and then we head to Coeur d'Alene. Won't get the full experience but I have to go somewhere.
"Tribes are a fragile population, infections are going up and tourists likely to simply complicate things more.I respect their decision, as well as their culture, it must survive!"
"Definitely disappointing, but there's nothing we can do. With all the news about the COVID spikes, I certainly understand. Now, onto Plan B in Wyoming for backpacking and camping for nature while social distancing."
Called it. Now I don't feel quite so bad about canceling my trip a couple days ago.
major bummer! cancelling whole trip now.
