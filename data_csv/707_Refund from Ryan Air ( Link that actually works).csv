Duff link ......
Why should I trust the above link?
Why would you claim a refund for a cancelled flight through the link to claim EU261 compensation that doesn't even give an option to claim a refund?
"As Leyland says, it's pointless trying to claim a refund through that link. The (proper) refund link isn't working, probably due to the large number of requests being made at the moment. Just give it a day or two and try again. If your flight is cancelled, you WILL get a refund."
"The link is good and accessible through the Ryan Air website. You can find the link to https://eu261compensationclaims.ryanair.com/ on the page https:/…eu-regulation-261-passenger-rights via the button ""Apply for Compensation"""
The link is fine but it's not the link you should use to request a refund.
John that is no good for requesting a refund. It's a compensation claim link.
Don't mix up refunds and compensation. There is no compensation payable on flights cancelled due to covid-19.
Here is information regarding EU 261 in the context of COVID-19. This is from the official EU website https:/…c20201830.pdf
The COVID-19 guidelines does not change the fact that the link you posted is not the link to request a refund.
