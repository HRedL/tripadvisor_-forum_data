"Hi all,I have a trip coming up to Maui and have asked KBM Hawaii for a refund but have not heard anything back. They are supremely unresponsive. Wonder if anyone else has had issues with them, if so perhaps we can band together and impress upon them the damage to their long-term business they are doing by not responding with a reasonable offer for cancelations. Not only will it ruin their business reputation from the customer side, but their homeowners might have second thoughts about re-signing with them if word gets out that they are not treating their customers well.Feel free to post and also DM me, we are stronger together."
What does your contract say about refunds?
"You can always tell the kind of business that you are dealing with when something goes wrong,I say this as someone who was in business 45 years it will come back on them and people will remember who treated then well and who didn’t."
"@b0rre1Very well said.KBM is setting a trend here that should remind us, and anyone who happens on this thread anytime in the future, to really think hard before booking with them.I don't want to hear people commenting on ""what the contract says"" - this is turning into something not seen in a century right before our eyes.AirBnB & VRBO and hotels and countless others where there was ""a contract"" understand the gravity here and are doing the right thing and working with people. This is not a time to hold up ""the contract"" in everyones face.I was told they won't even reach out to the owner of the condo that we are renting - the person they WORK for in this situation - to even inquire.We simply want a reschedule in the next year, not even a refund...But they won't even ask the owner or put me in touch with that party (not my first choice anyhow).Why? Likely they are protecting their cut here above the interests of their customer on the owner and renter side of the transaction.And - they aren't even responding to phone calls and emails anymore.Horrendous KBM - Simply unethical and horrendous and getting worse all the time right now as the reports pile up.Edited: 8:03 pm, March 15, 2020 "
Yes - we are having issues as well. They are standing by their cancellation policy which states 45 days in advance for a partial refund and 90 days for a full refund. This pandemic situation was not going on 45 days ago and every other company has updated their policies to be more lenient. The locals on this board are begging people not to come and yet KBM is being ignorant.
Tomorrow is my 45 day mark with KBM for upcoming rental. I am beginning to think I should cancel and request refund so that I only am out my deposit.
"Not every company is doing any different. And KBM can only do what their owners ALLOW them to do. Some people **have gotten credit** for future stay(s).Braysmomma, so your trip is around the end of April? I'd be much more concerned about whether it will be safe to travel anywhere then. I would also contact KBM and ask them what they can do for you.Edited: 10:13 pm, March 15, 2020 "
@BraysmommaABSOLUTELY cancel if you can!I’m envious.
Will be calling tomorrow and hoping trip insurance will cover deposit I won't get back. My mom who is almost 80 was to travel with us and her doctor will write a note stating she can't travel. Hopefully this might get the rest back from insurance.
Good luck......... do remember the time change :-). You are 6 hours ahead of us now.If her doctor says due to the risk of COVID-19 the insurance may not cover.
"@BraysmommaVery smart move!If you’d be so kind and you think of it, could you also report back here with how it goes on your interactions with KBM so we can keep on top of that?Thank you so much!"
I just left Josh a message so hopefully will hear something back tomorrow and I will keep you updated with his response. @Akama thank you for advice. I will check with trip insurance and see what I need to do.
"Just call me ""SW"", that's easier and what I go by :-).COVID-19 is a known and declared risk. Hence my concern about your insurance."
"We are also stuck and not being allowed a refund or contact with owner, who I I am sure would be willing to reschedule. We want this trip. These circumstances are so extreme and unheard of, who could have predicted this? We got two calls back actually but with nothing to offer us. I am not sure legally what we can do here but every other place has been flexible. Sad for KBM but they will have a bad name for how this was handled for a long time."
"@Summer loverBummer - Majorly..The issue I have really with KBM is that they are standing between us and who actually owns the unit and not allowing communication or notification to them.As you said, for all any of us individually know, there very well could be a very nice owner on the other side who totally gets how unusual this is and *absolutely* would love to accommodate a reschedule for people......but KBM is only worried about their financial cut of that owners money and not even telling them anyone would like to reschedule or cancel, etc.That's the issue. It's very much on the side of unethical to be taking that particular hard line, given the situation, by KBM Hawaii.They are choosing this one off commission and jeopardizing their entire reputation, and perhaps future as a company, over it."
"Sooo.... owners hire companies like this to deal with the issues. They don’t want to deal with it and talk with the renters. If they did... they would do more like what chisue does and have a company, but also do some bookings themselves. Sorry but this is what the owners pay these companies to do. Like it or not, it’s the way it is."
"@travelbugged4Normally I'd agree with you completely...But this is a truly unique and exceptional, worldwide, uncharted situation, as you of course know.This is way different than any of the normal ""I hired KBM to deal with my rental and that's that"" type of situation.Edited: 2:16 am, March 16, 2020 "
It would really surprise me that owners aren't aware people want to cancel their vacations and get some kind of refund. If that's true then the owners have a few screws loose.  These owners need to take some responsibility themselves and let the management companies in on what their course of action is. Maybe they already do and it's them that is keeping these companies from refunding money.
It may not be “normal times” but some owners still don’t want to deal with people.
"Personally I sympathize with everyone who wants a refund or to reschedule. If I owned a vacation rental I would hope I would be in a position where I could afford to allow people to re-schedule. But it is not fair to say “I don’t care what the contract says”. That is basically saying you entered into an agreement and everyone knew the terms. But now that everything has gone sour, you want the owner to suffer the loss regardless of the agreement. The owners likely have mortgages to pay, large HOA fee’s to pay. It can also be a huge financial hit to them which, in some cases could result in foreclosure if they can’t make their payment. Everyone is in a tough spot. In my mind, if I were a vacation rental owner, I would ask my management company to try to accommodate a one-time re-schedule. But in the end, they are not obligated to do so. My guess with AirBnb is they likely are covering that cost themselves or with insurance and not taking the money back from unit owners. But that’s just a hunch. Bottom line, it’s a bad situation for everyone."
"@Eight Oh EightThe owners aren't suffering a ""loss"" - the rentals haven't even taken place, and given what's taking place, their unit would have been empty otherwise.....and they particularly aren't taking a loss if all someone wants is a reschedule for a time in the future."
Just got my final payment back since I'm at the 45 day mark today. Lost $700 from deposit. Josh actually answered his phone when I called.
"@BraysmommaGood to hear (sort of)I don't supposed you asked or discussed with Josh their plan on simply even responding to the inquiries coming by phone/email from so many others?It's unconscionable to me that they aren't even interacting with guests on their schedule while the whole of the internet is telling everyone to cancel, don't come, stay away --- and before long we may even have flights physically stopped..And the KBM plan is to keep ALL of peoples money and not even work with anyone on rescheduling, even at discounted rates?"
"We are in the same position. Our trip is planned for April 2 through the 10th. When we contacted KBM, we were not looking for a refund necessarily, and were hoping we could simply reschedule our reservation. KBM told us that, ""unless a travel ban is extended to Hawaii,"" the cancellation and refund policy remains as spelled out in our lease. KBM did offer two options. One option is to transfer our reservation to another party such as a friend, family member, or colleague. Not really a viable option for us.The second option is for them to re-market the unit and send us whatever rent they are able to receive. However, they did note that the last-minute price will be less than our booking and there is no guarantee they will be able to re-lease the property. Frankly, the way things are going this does not seem to be much of an option, either.For us, it seems like it really comes down to we either make the trip to Maui in April, or we lose about 6 thousand dollars. KBM’s position right now encourages people to travel to Maui, potentially putting their guests and Maui residents in danger. I wonder how their friends and neighbors feel about KBM’s policy? In any event, we decided that the ethical thing to do is to heed experts’ advice and stay home, and not risk transmitting the virus to the island (or bringing it back to our loved ones.) Unless a travel ban is put in place, I guess we take the monetary loss, but I remain hopeful KBM will revise their policy in the near future—things are only going to get worse, unfortunately."
KBM - reaping what they will sow once this is behind us
We are trying to reschedule to the end of the year and zero response. Agree it’s about the long term and not just the short term.
"Sorry you don't to hear ""what the contract says"". You should know what the contract says because the contract might be in the renter's favor."
"I don't think anyone who is in the situation of being stuck with a contract in the renter's favour, needs reminding of what they could have done differently.A bit of compassion for what people are dealing with would be a lot better ... not only do they have the disappointment of cancelling a vacation that they were really looking forward to - but losing a lot of money on a vacation rental while dealing with a rental agency that isn't easy to communicate with. We're not in that situation - but it's not difficult to understand how distressing it is for those who are."
"I've rented from KBM in the past, and while some folks on here have had issues with them in the past, my two stays with them were free of any issues, and I've even commented in the past on here in my support of KBM.Given the current situation and the approach KBM is presenting here (as opposed to other rentals agencies and their approach), I personally will be skeptical to use KBM for any of my future trips, and I hope all of you would do the same."
"Owners are losing out either way, since I won't be booking with KBM in the future, so that owner loses out where they could have gained a future booking. KBM is being shortsighted AND practicing poor business by not even answering emails and calls!We cancelled a few days before our 45days was up. I tried emailing with no response.Left 2 voicemails with Josh - Principal Broker which is who our contract said we needed to contact to cancel - no call back.Called the main line and was told they were abiding by their strict cancellation policy at this time and she could process my cancellation.Lost our deposit $1,500+USDI asked if given the situation they would amend their policy and offer a future travel credit - NO!I have since emailed Josh...again (no response), asking they confirm my cancellation as the email I received from Guest Services after I called to cancel doesn't specify my trip is cancelled. Under Reservation Details & Confirmation it says ""There are no pending reservations in your cart"" However, it shows the Pay Now amount and in the body of the email, ""We look forward to your arrival and please let me know if there is anything we can do to make your stay most enjoyable."" It also states that if payment is not received within 10 days from your transaction date, the amount due will be processed on the credit card on file.I've also emailed Guest Services back and not optimistic I'll get a response. I will try calling again today but I would like a confirmation in writing.These are unprecedented times! MANY other companies are making exceptions during this very difficult time. We all have bills to pay and sacrifices to make, to say it's not fair to the owner but think it's fair to us for losing our money, makes no sense to me! I have insurance however, am very unclear whether I will be covered, many aren't. I can't even get through & keep getting disconnected.We very much wanted this trip and didn't just change our minds. I am very happy we hadn't yet paid our amount in full and really hope they don't try to charge my credit card. (Trying to get a hold of my card company as well)"

"I believe there's someone on here who owns a unit at Honua Kai and uses KBM as their rental agency. I'd love to hear what KBM is communicating to them, but my guess is that this individual doesn't want to say too much on this out of fear of stirring up more issues with any of their upcoming bookings at their unit.Look, I understand this issue sucks. It sucks for everyone involved. It sucks for the renters who are potentially out thousands of dollars because they cannot move forward with their plans. It sucks for the condo owners because they likely are counting on these rentals to cover their mortgages and condo association payments.It's disappointing that KBM and the condo owners won't offer some sort of credit to folks who unfortunately have to cancel to where this credit can be used to rebook (perhaps there would even be stipulations to where the rebooking must be during an off-peak time when there is a chance the condo would otherwise sit empty)."
"And it also sucks that there are other companies that won't work with people AT ALL, but only KBM is being singled out.KBM can only do what its contract and owners allow them to do.If people don't want those cheap rates and tighter policies----- book with a big company like Outrigger or Aston. You'll pay more but have a more liberal cancellation policy (UNLESS you book a non-refundable rate with them). This is nothing new. It seems like it to some people, but since the advent of 'vrbo' etc., we have seen complaints like this. It didn't have to be a virus--often it has just been a change for other reasons.When you sign a contract, you agree to its terms. For better or worse........CV-19 or a 09-11 or a financial crash. Don't blame others for YOUR failure to get good insurance or pay a provider that allows changes."
"Wow!I booked knowing their cancellation policy AND knowing that my insurance was in the event of illness with a medical note or a death in the family. NO ONE could have predicted this! AND because I booked with KBM my concern is not with the other companies as I don't have first hand experience with them!Because we are in unprecedented territory, they could make amends as others have. This isn't because we changed our minds! They are not even answering calls or emails which is terrible Customer Service!This thread is for KBM Issues and if others are having similar problems with their booking companies, I would advise them to start a post for those companies.Also, I would strongly disagree my rate was ""cheap"". I could have booked through Costco for less (I wish I did, hearing how they have treated their customers) but I could not pick the unit. I booked with KBM so I could book the exact unit I wanted."
"But that's my point, Chica--you give up some things with KBM---and some things with Costco. You weren't losing your entire sum, right? You lost or are maybe losing your deposit? Have you not seen the new post about KBM's changes, either? There are posts by people who lost their ***Whole*** amount with other companies....but nobody posts 100 posts or 20 threads about those companies.Many other companies are worse, or the same. But thread after thread is about ONE. That's offensive to me, because it isn't fair or representative of the truth.Like I said on another thread......this is just like after 09-11 and the crash in 2008---only the screen names have changed. People need to do their own research and contract for what they can afford AND what they can afford to lose.Yes--I'm being harsh. But it's time for people to step up and stop expecting others to take a hit for them. Lastly---blame the OWNERS.....not the agency.SWEdited: 4:22 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"@SW I did see a post re KBM changes but when they won't answer my emails or return my calls, I haven't personally seen those changes. I am happy for the people that have and can only hope they reconsider with myself as well. I absolutely feel for the people who have lost their full payments.I and many others are expressing our distaste and experience with KBM because that's who we booked with! Not sure why that is offensive to you exactly?!Also, with respect, this is NOTHING like 9-11, don't even compare the two please! As I have said before, how businesses conduct themselves during difficult times is what will set them apart when the dust settles. May those companies benefit in the future."
"Chica--with regard to vacation rental---it IS like 09-11. I know, because I was not only here but in tourism with my own business then. I speak from experience and trying to help people who were both totally freaked out and unable to cope.As I said----the multiple threads and constant posts (even in unrelated threads) about KBM offends me because it isn't fair. Perhaps they could have gotten owners to agree sooner to changes..or perhaps not. But the campaign against them and them alone is not pono.I hope very much that you and others hear from them soon. I would suggest calling them early in the day, like 8 AM our time. Maybe you can get ahead of their other stuff.....I don't know."
"I have tried calling early 8am and 9am your time and still nothing. It doesn't matter what time I call or send emails they don't respond! At the very least I would like written confirmation of my cancellation!Perhaps if they answered emails and phone messages there would be less posts on here.I just think it is in poor taste to even compare to 9-11 IMO.Edited: 5:02 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"I am not comparing COVID-19 to the loss of life in 09-11. I am talking about the tourism and related businesses here on MAUI after major events. You have no idea how hard it was here after 09-11.........for all of us AND tourists who were stranded and panicked.You have no idea how hard it was for we who lost friends in 09-11 and after it as well. But this isn't about those things......this is about tourism business after a major event.

"Wanted to share this latest update with those reviewers who have been trying to get a refund or reschedule through KBM in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We were very frustrated too. They told us last week their cancellation policy stands unless there is a travel ban to Hawaii with no opportunity to get a refund or reschedule. It looks like they have since updated their policy and are now allowing rescheduling. We called them again this morning and were able to reschedule our stay to late summer. If you are impacted, I urge you to try them again - and call the new reservations line as opposed to the existing reservations line for a faster response."
"@Judy CThank you for the update - that is great to hear.It's not so great to hear that the ""new reservations"" line is getting more attended to than the ""existing reservations"" line however. That would leave the cynical among us ---- ""wondering"" shall we say..Hopefully that's just a coincidence.Edited: 5:40 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Where can I find this new reservation line please?
"GOOD NEWS!!!Not only have they contacted me, they have issued us a credit for future use!!They could have handled the situation way better from the start BUT they have made right and I will always give credit where credit is due!!Thank you KBM! I hope you are all getting resolutions as well!"
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Such good news amidst so much bad.
"I'm also happy to announce that my trip has been rescheduled for next Winter courtesy of KBM.Like some others here - obviously I was very unhappy with the stance KBM and their unit owners looked to be initially taking, but it gives me great pride to eat my words a bit and happily thank them for doing a great thing and working to accommodate (hopefully all) people.Thank you KBM!"
"Excellent news Windows! Glad it all worked out and I have to think that complaints and concerns expressed here by those affected helped to result in a resolution that worked for KBM, unit owners and renters. Nice that you and others will have a Maui vacation to look forward to within the next year!"
"So good that they are finally coming through! I gotta wonder... did someone alert them to this thread? Either way, it's great news."
Yes! Very glad to see the report from Windows too :-).
Did you end up cancelling? I was 49 days out and exactly on the 60 day mark yesterday for our Oahu property so I rebooked our trip for October.. Lost out on almost $1800 from KBM but still getting $4300 back. Better than nothing.
"Emailed, called, tried the chat feature on the website, and still no response from KBM. Sent them a ""sternly worded email"" today asking for at least a response. Hopefully that'll do the trick. Hoping they are least respond, and then respond with something promising!!"
"Just an update: I had initially posted a couple of weeks ago that we did not have luck getting our reservation postponed in early April. I am happy to report that we were able to reschedule for March 2021. I was able to get in touch with one of the owners, Jacki, who was very responsive and accommodating. We did not ask for nor expect a refund and I am very happy with KBM’s response to what is really an unprecedented event. Be safe everyone."
"We just worked with KBM Hawaii to rebook our May vacation to next year. They were very responsive and great to work with. Sorry you did not have a good experience. We sent an email and got a response a few days later, then we called and they got back to us the same day. They were very accommodating and we got full credit for the new reservation."
"Very nice, Stewart. Indeed, a very scary and strange time for everyone. I don't think anyone should plan a trip until at least late November or December...sorry, but I feel strongly that we will have many more cases ahead."
"Hi all - we had a rental booked for the last week of March. When they told us they would only apply the credit for a future date, we booked for 4 months out. The very next day, I cancelled the reservation and because it was 3+ months out, they were forced, according to their contract, to refund us 100%. The refund went through in full. I would never book with them again, but I hope this helps someone!"
"We have a reservation with Kbm for June 2-9. We already lost our down deposit since we needed to cancel by March 3. Our entire payment is due by April 18th. If I am understanding the new cancellation policy correctly, would it be best to pay the the rest that is due, cancel, rebook, and then cancel?Edited: 9:33 pm, April 10, 2020 "
"It's not a new policy...and no, you wouldn't pay the balance first.I think you should contact KBM and ask them to help you out."
We would lose our down deposit if we did not pay in full by April 18th
Beth--the one time post above yours concerns me for many reasons. You should be paying attention to the other posters who have reported KBM working with them and helping them honestly.Just my opinion---but you should be contacting KBM and ignoring that post. And I don't mean contact them April 18....I mean try to reach them NOW.
The contract says that we will lose our deposit if we don’t pay in full since a cancellation was required by March 3rd. We have already payed close to $653 which is a lot of $ for us to lose.
"We typically talk to people directly first. Our first step is to contact American Airlines. From what I read, it sounds like we can cancel and then rebook. It’s unclear though by when we need to rebook. We would like to rebook again for early June since that is the best time for us to take a vacation. Flights for June don’t typically come out until 10 months in advance. I am worried about rebooking for June with KBM and not having a flight yet. We really do need to talk with both Kbm and American first to know our options before making any cancellations. We plan on calling American tomorrow first and then will call KBM afterwards."
Beth.......I am trying to help. Contract terms and matters have changed many times during this last month. No one doubts your need for the money or a credit.But you need to contact KBM and ask them what they will do for you now. Only they can tell you.You may well find that they will extend that deposit to another booking next year or even give you a refund. But no one here knows what they will do for YOU. Only KBM can answer that.
Thank you for your responses. We will try to contact them tomorrow. I have waited a little bit to let things settle down plus I was hoping perhaps we could still travel by June. April 18th will be here soon so the sooner I call the better. Thanks again!
"You're welcome......remember that we don't do Daylight Savings, so you are 4 hours ahead of us now."
I hope you get a great answer tomorrow! Please do come back and tell us what happened. SW
I had a reservation with KBM for arrival in May. Due to COVID-19 they are allowing me to apply my deposit money in full to a new reservation within the next 18 months. Very fair IMO. Hoping to get back to Maui as soon as we safely can.....
"Thanks for your response Kim! Based off what is posted on KBM’s website, it sounds like we will at least get credit to rebook within the next 18 months. We still want to go to Maui too and I think we will try to rebook for next June. I just got an email this morning with a significant change to our flight. Instead of flying from Salt lake with a connecting flight to Phoenix, they have us with a connecting flight to Dallas with our flight ending in Phoenix instead of Maui! Based of DOT policy, We should now be able to cancel our flight with a full refund. We then would need to wait until about August before flights are available to purchase for next June. If KBM does allow us to cancel our reservation, there would be a good chance we would book with them again. There is a condo I really like plus I like the car rental deal. In the past, I have booked condos in advance before booking my flights. I am a little Leary to do that now given the situation. We will make our phone calls today to American and KBM. Hopefully, we won’t need to wait too long on hold with American!"
"Good news, Beth....glad you are able to get a refund from AA and I am sure KBM will help you plan another trip."
I finally was able to talk to KBM today. (It was hard to find a time to call M-F between 8:30-4:30 while both working and trying to homeschool my son). I was told that I could cancel my reservation and be credited what we payed for the deposit. I have up to 18 months to use it from the time our trip was supposed to be. I am okay with this outcome especially since we would like to most likely rebook for June 2021. She said I would receive an email with the cancellation and that I could call when I was ready to rebook. I haven’t received an email yet though. For those of you who have cancelled how long did it take for you to receive a cancellation email?
"Did you get the email yet? Also, check your SPAM/junk mail folders.Glad you got it worked out.SW"
Nope. Not yet and I checked my spam. I am going to try emailing them.
"I'm sure it will be fine. Do remember the time difference, too. It's just 7:30 here."
Yeah! Glad you are set.
We are booked through KBM for one of our rooms in February - they have been responsive and great so far.Was happy to hear that your issue was successfully resolved!
Well just got a partial refund on our deposit in the mail today. I had no idea what it was for nor did I realize KBM was sending a refund. My check is from KMA Capital Corporation. Has anyone else received a refund?
We cancelled within our terms of conditions and were told we would receive a full refund. They refuse to refund to our credit card or via bank deposit so they have sent a cheque to Australia. That was 9 weeks ago. I’ve emailed three times to ask them to rectify this and they didn’t even use tracking on the cheque. Has anyone else had a refund via cheque. This seems very unusual.
When they sent out my check in April I got it in a week but I’m in the US. I would think at this point they need to void & reissue that refund check!
Just wondering if you heard back from KBM Hawaii regarding your refund. We paid for accommodation in October 2019 and cancelled our accommodation within our 90 cancellation policy in March. They told us that we would receive a full refund minus a small booking fee but that was 10 weeks ago. They refused to repay the money via our credit card and told us that they sent us a cheque in the mail to Australia which was not tracked. Ridiculous business practices. 10 weeks and no money. What does everyone think?
"You need to contact them. A check not arriving in 10 weeks is too long, even for international mail."
