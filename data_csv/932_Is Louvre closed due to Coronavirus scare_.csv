Just saw it on the news.Is that true? We planned guided tour on March 9..Thanks!
Yes it's closed at the moment but you might get lucky and it may be open by the time of your trip.

"There is already a thread on this, still on the first page of the Paris forum:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18714…It's usually a good idea to take a few minutes to browse the forum before starting another thread on a topic already being discussed (particularly one related to the current virus situation)."
It seems there wasn’t a scare but that the staff are refusing to work without certain things put in place of them (hand sanitizer and screens at the booths they sell tickets from).Could be wrong but that’s what I read.I fly in 11 days and am hoping it will be open.
I am frankly surprised that staff had to close the place down to get those simple precautions that should have been in place long ago.
Handheld fever readers sell for as little as 18.99 on Amazon. Would anyone have a problem getting their forehead read for a high temperature by the security guard checking your bags already? Would you enter the Louvre if the ten people in front of you in line just failed a simple 0.5 second fever test...
Not all that surprising since there were almost no cases in France 48 hours ago. Have MOMA or the Getty prepared a Covid-19 plan?
@7 answer is probably not. The comment goes for anywhere in the world that sees a large influx of world travelers on a daily basis. I don't think the USA is taking this as seriously as they should....today Italy...tomorrow another country.
once it is loose it is not really containable regardless of precautions. Kids for example appear to not get very sick from it but are as usual wonderful sticky little vectors. It has apparently been steaming along below the radar in Washington State for the past 6 weeks and just now beginning to be picked up. The US has failed to even test for it so we can assume it is much more widespread than they advertise. And probably in France too. The good news is that most people apparently are not seriously sick; the bad news is that some of us are in the age group that it appears most likely to kill.My grandmother died in the 1918 flu epidemic at age 25 -- this one feels like it might be coming for me.
"They left people outside standing in lines for hours before deciding to close, really bad form, people’s tourist time is limited and precious in Paris."
"They also did that at an expo today but based on the latest 5,000 person limit directive. They turned people back at 5001. The Louvre closure is the staff using their proverbial card for striking as their way of forcing the issue. Amazing that and bravo to the intelligent staff.I myself would not follow behind 10 people that just failed a fever test so not sure about the summation it's not worth the precaution..."
"Ronnie, they had been hoping to reopen but the discussions with the museum workers went on longer than anticipated. It’s a serious concern, with the number of visitors from all over the world who fill the museum every day.Check the museum website for further updates.(Also see museum website re any refunds if you had a timed-Entry ticket for a time when museum was not open.)"
"Further update: museum still closed pending ongoing discussions.Important to note that the museum was not closed by government. The museum workers are demanding (with good cause) better protection from risk of being infected by visitors. So discussions on still ongoing between museum workers and management, in hopes of a resolution that will enable reopening. Keep checking museum website for updates.Louvre remains closed, Paris Book Fair cancelled over Covid-19rfi.fr/en/france/20200302-culture-takes-hit-…"

"piratepirate, the problem with trying to keep the whole discussion organized just on the “sticky” topic is that the option to “reply”, to either ask a question or add information, is not there when one uses the Trip Advisor app instead of going through a browser to the full website. And on my phone, even if I go through the Safari browser to the full website, the “reply” option just does not appear to post anything for any “sticky” discussion. So it’s difficult for everyone to ask questions or add info. if accessing Trip Advisor on a phone (while traveling)....."
