"WE booked tickets and hotel rooms as a package for the World Curling Event scheduled to begin on April 27th in Glasgow. The event was cancelled due to travel restrictions because of Covid 19. We had a terrible time getting the hotel rooms refunded, because the Marriott wouldn't give the organizing committee a refund, and finally got them to give us our rebate (at the current exchange rate, so $137 short), which they said was 80% of the total cost. In looking at our original invoice, I see that there was VAT of 20% added to both tickets and rooms. Obviously, we can't fix this at Customs. How do we recover the VAT on these expenses for the cancelled event."
"Travel insurance? Or did the booking have a non-refundable element? Is there more to tell us?Edited: 3:58 pm, April 23, 2020 "
Are you saying that had you stayed you would have tried to recover the VAT when you left the country at VAT refunds? If this is the case you can only basically get a VAT refund on goods not services.If this is not the case I don’t understand your question.
VAT can only be recovered on goods exported so as said neither element would be covered.
"Is it just a coincidence that the withheld amount is 20%? May be nothing to do with VAT at all, just a partial refund."
The government is paying 80% of basic wages for many employees suspended during the Covid crisis. Maybe that's a figure the hotel plucked from thin air for a partial refund. Maybe nothing to do with VAT.
">>> In looking at our original invoice, I see that there was VAT of 20% added to both tickets and rooms. Obviously, we can't fix this at Customs. How do we recover the VAT on these expenses for the cancelled event.<<<Even if the event had gone ahead you could not reclaim the VAT for those services when leaving the country because they are not reclaimable in any case."
"In all the hundreds of Posts about people losing money over cancellations due to Covid-19, you are whinging about 137 Bucks!"
"Madscotsman, Americans have a unhealthy association with vat as well as not being able to use a knife and fork property! (Am waiting for the replies! Lol) Denny’s got things riled up"
"It sounds like this was booked through a 3rd party, so the 20% may be their fee.OP, as others have sais, VAT on services is not recoverable."
"They aren’t trying to recover the VAT. They are trying to get their money refunded. When you get a refund it isn’t minus VAT.They aren’t only out $137, that is the amount they have lost on currency exchange. They are out 20%+the exchange difference.I suspect they are keeping 20% for themselves and the VAT issue is coincidental"
"If the amount withheld was for the VAT, it would not be 20%. It would be 16.67%. You can work that out for yourself. If your original bill had been $1,200, then that would have been $1000 for the service and $200 for the VAT. 200 is 16.67% of 1,200.This supports the argument that the amount withheld was not the VAT, but was either some sort of cancellation charge, or, as others have suggested, an amount plucked out of the air.Obviously the first thing you should have done is to check your contract to see what it specified as a cancellation policy."
"Chris,The OP clearly states ""recovering VAT"" both in terms title and body of their post, so that *is* what they are trying to do. It sounds like they are dealing with this at 3 or 4 steps removed from the actual booking with talk of an ""organising committee"" etc."
"For a start, the “Organising Committee” or whoever Made the Block Booking of The Curling Tickets, would have received a Full Refund for that element of the “Package”!Also, any VAT (if Due) will be paid to HMRC months down the Line, so how can you possibly claim a VAT Return from HMRC when they haven’t received any to start with!It sounds like a condition of booking that you will loose some of your money if cancelled, and as I pointed out in the first paragraph, it is likely that the Marriott is keeping the other 20%"
">>The OP clearly states ""recovering VAT"" both in terms title and body of their post, so that *is* what they are trying to do.<<No, its what the OP have assumed that they are doing based on receiving an 80% refund and jumping to the conclusion that this means the supplier has retained the VAT because we add VAT at 20%.As pointed out already, thats a mathematical mistake - had VAT been retained they'd not be getting an exact 80% refund, but an 83.something% refund.Im very much with those that are saying someone has kept a 20% cut - be that the third party organiser or the hotels offering limited refund on non-refundable bookings by taking an admin fee to process them.What the OP needs to do is find out who is retaining money and the basis on which they are doing it. Even then it may still end up being a case of 'outta luck'"
"Unfortunately, the terms of the ""package"" were that after 20 December 2019, it became non changeable and non refundable, according to the agents, www.cseplc.com so I'd say the OP is doing pretty well to get an 80% refund. Obviously, no-one can control exchange rates, so he/she will just have to take that ""loss"".Edited: 6:45 am, April 24, 2020 "
">>> I see that there was VAT of 20% added to both tickets and rooms. Obviously, we can't fix this at Customs. How do we recover the VAT on these expenses for the cancelled event.<<<Whilst it's not clear why the OP has not been refunded in full it seems clear enough to me that they seem to think they can reclaim the VAT on the rooms and tickets, and are under the impression they can do this whether they attend or not.Like others have said, the deduction from the refund they have received is most likely an admin charge. They should be asking the organising comittee for an explanation."
