"It is too early to speak of ""infected areas"". It's just single cases, 25 of them nationwide. Most are still of people who returned from international trips and contracted the virus outside Poland.Anyway the precautionary measures are fully justified at this stage. It is much easier to contain the virus now than when the number of cases reaches thousands. We should all minimize travel and social contacts now."

At the moment you can only enter/cross Poland without quarantine if it's a business trip and you present some sort of confirmation from your employer. As far as I remember your trip is in August so still a lot of time.
"@KurlanderMinistry of the Interior and Administration announced on 21 May that transit though Poland is allowed for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens provided it takes no more than 12 hours. Quarantine is not required.(Google translate)The regulation has expanded the catalog of persons authorized to cross the Polish border (entry and exit) to[...]-- citizens of the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area (EEA) or the Swiss Confederation and their spouses and children, for the purpose of crossing the territory of the Republic of Poland, lasting no longer than 12 hours from the moment of crossing the border of the Republic of Poland, to the place of residence or stay.These persons are exempted from quarantine pursuant to the Regulation of the Council of Ministers regarding the establishment of specific restrictions, orders and bans in connection with the occurrence of the state of the epidemic.https:/…nowe-zasady-przekraczania-granicy"
^^ Note though that it only applies to those travelling to the place of their residence or stay. So I'm not sure if this is a good news for @Kurlander already or not yet?
Place of stay (miejsce pobytu) has a broad meaning and it doesn't seem to be defined in the ordinance. I see no reason why it can't mean short-term stay (miejsce pobytu czasowego) like a week's stay in a hotel in Austria or wherever.
"I'm not a layer but ""miejsce pobytu czasowego"" is defined (not in rozporządzenie but in ustawa) ""Zgodnie z ustawą pobytem czasowym jest przebywanie obywatela polskiego poza miejscem pobytu stałego przez okres ponad trzech miesięcy""https://bip.malopolska.pl/ugoswiecim,a,11092…So if his stay in a hotel in Austria is longer than 3 months, then it's ""miejsce pobytu czasowego"". If it's for a week, it doesn't seem to be, and hence someone intending a week holidays would be turned back at the border because he doesn't drive to his ""miejsce pobytu"".Edited: 6:36 am, May 23, 2020 "

"No, I'm quite certain they will not ""be checking"". They will be demanding any foreigner wanting to enter Poland to provide a proof that they are travelling to a place of residence or stay, because otherwise he/she is not allowed to enter. The burden of proof is on the person trying to use an exemption to proof they are eligible for to use an exemption, not on the border guards to prove that some is not eligible. That's how all rules regarding crossing borders of all countries in the world work: if you can't let the boarder guard verified you are eligible for entering this country, you will not be allowed to enter.Edited: 7:47 am, May 23, 2020 "
"Thanks for info.It's OK for a moment. I just look after tendencies for easing border crossing.My trip throughout Poland is planned in the middle of August. But IMO even now there can't be problems to transit Poland territory (in 12. hours ) if I have, for example, booking confirmation with fixed dates who shows my purpose to stay in a place, which I can't reach without transit. It logical. No border guard can decide subjective side of my trip if I have objective evidence. And, my experience with border crossing show that borders guards ( like all kind of policemens ) is just humans.And if you are polite, they can be persuaded in proper direction. :)Because interpretation of rules always have some uncertainty and broadness."
"A new round of loosening restrictions will apply from Saturday 30 May, i.a. no face masks requirement in the open space anymore and much less restrictions on bars and restaurants. See more info here in English:https:/…Still no reliable schedule of the border reopening - there is much talk of mid-June but no official confirmation.What is worrying is that the daily number of new covid-19 cases in Poland has not decreased at all, so the epidemic maintains a steady rate, in a marked difference to almost all other European countries where the slowdown is very visible."
They are not covid19 cases. They are people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. How many of them will develop covid19 symptoms and of what severity remains to be seen. Personally I'm flabbergasted that the whole world is counting positive lab results rather than people who are actually ill and need medical attention. If you test any part of your body with a sensitive molecular test you are going to find loads of harmful pathogens but it does not automatically mean that you have all the diseases caused by them.
Montenegro allowed entrance of Poles. It means that they define Poland as good fighter against Kovi issue.:)
"of course they are counting positive lab results as opposed to people actually getting sick.....how better to scare people into compliance ….if people knew that %80 wont be or will be little affected by this virus and the rest are very old and have comorbidities,they would be as much afraid as they are with the common flu"

Ryanair will resume their operations to/from Poland on 1st July
"Even if the borders get opened, if you're from the US then I'd consider it almost certain that tourism from US will still be banned for a long time after that. ""Banned"" most likely means that the border might be opened, but anyone travelling from the US and other ""highly covid-ed"" countries will need to undertake a 2-week quarantine after entering Poland just like it's now – which doesn't align well with the idea of tourism.Edited: 1:29 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Gee....USA is a country I want to get out of.What about providing a negative COVID19 test? Do you think that Polish Gov. will require this ?I guess I'll go to Italy...the real hot spot as they are opening up to International tourism,"
">>>What about providing a negative COVID19 test? Do you think that Polish Gov. will require this ?I don't think so. I think that when the borders open for tourists there will be no need for any tests or quarantine. That's why it's taking so long. People currently allowed to enter Poland (for example business travellers, people in transit, cross-border workers) are not required to show negative RT-PCR test results.Edited: 1:05 am, June 05, 2020 "
"The analysis are still ongoing on the possible opening of Polish borders. The government is guided by the dynamics of the increase in COVID-19 incidence and the situation in other countries. The decision to open borders will be made if the government is convinced that it is safe. From Wednesday, EU citizens can travel to Italy. Austria opens its borders on Thursday. Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Greece plan to do so on 15 June. Spain will open on June 22. Currently, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs still recommends that its citizens avoid any foreign travel."
"Even those countries that are advertising opening their borders are not necessarily doing it unconditionally. For example Greece is planning to perform random RT-PCR tests on all arrivals after 15 June. Those selected will be escorted off the plane, swabbed and transferred to a designated hotel where they will spend their first night waiting for the test results. If the test comes back negative they will be released, if positive they will spend two weeks in quarantine under close supervision. Their families/close contacts (passengers sitting close to them) will be traced and tested/quarantined too. Quarantine rules in Greece are the same as in Poland. You can't leave your accommodation and police does frequent checks. Breaking quarantine rules incurs five thousand euro fine.I suggest reading the small print before booking anything this year."
Thank you both for the insight.

"Look at post #82Although Poland has lifted the restrictions on crossing the border for citizens and residents of the European Union, the restrictions on crossing the border for travelers who are not citizens or residents of the European Union remain in force. American or Canadian citizens will not be able to enter Poland. The Polish Border Guard will randomly check compliance with the above restrictions. So, you are not allowed to enter Poland unless you hold Polish or EU passport.The tourist sights are open, hotels, restaurants etc. Edited: 1:49 am, July 16, 2020 "
The current sitiuation with tourist business in Poland:https:/…
are these back open now?thanks
Thank you for the update Hoshi-San. It is very difficult to determine whether we could come to Poland. For example I went to LOT airlines and tried to book a flight next week. No mention that Canadian citizens are not allowed to enter Poland! They are advertising flights to different parts of Poland from Toronto. I will be contacting them to ask why they are not alerting us to this fact.
"My understanding is that when the government allowed flights from Canada and several other non-EU countries to resume on 1 July they also cancelled the quarantine requirement for people coming from those countries. I don't know why Hoshi-San says that Canadians can't enter PolandEdited: 11:55 am, July 16, 2020 "
"OK. Canadians are allowed if arriving directly from CanadaPoland can be entered by aircraft passengers on an international flight from an airport located in the territory of: Montenegro, Georgia, Japan, Canada, the Republic of Albania, the Republic of Korea.https:/…"
Thank you both for your replies. Hopefully we will be coming to Poland in September.
"There has been a drastic increase in infections in recent days. Today, almost a record, 600 cases mainly in southern Poland (Katowice and Kraków area)"
Thanks so much for keeping us informed. I am planning a 3 week vacation in Poland in August. I hope the situation improves.
"As far as I'm aware the recent spike is caused largely by the mass testing of three more coal mines last week. Last time thousands of miners were tested, we saw similar spikes. The overwhelming majority of them have no symptoms."
"No, it cannot be explained by mass testing in coal mines anymore. Some of the cases in Silesia (Katowice region) are indeed related to mines but those in Małopolska region (around Kraków, with Kraków itself being less affected) are mainly caused by family events like weddings and funerals, church gatherings and contagion at work in several places, ranging from offices to police stations to factories.Edited: 5:43 pm, July 30, 2020 "
