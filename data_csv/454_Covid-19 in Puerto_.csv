Any reports of Covid-19 in Puerto?Is there a website showing which areas in Tenerife have the virus?
"Are you out there now, Peter?In many ways it’s irrelevant as the islands are in lockdown so you shouldn’t be outside unless you are going to a supermarket or chemist."
yes there are cases on the islandand the whole of the island is in lock downjust wondered why you wanted to know about puerto in particular
"I would actually like to know too. I’d like to know if we have been in an area where there were a lot of cases . Yes we are in isolation but we could still have already got it as it takes awhile ,which is my worry at the moment .,We avoided the H10 area when it was there ,but since that its never been mentioned where it was."
I have tenants booked to go there and they are asking me for information.Always difficult getting information in Tenerife so looking for someone who is actually there now.
"Peter - the Spanish government has taken over all command of the country (they say), above the local juntas. You are only allowed to go outdoors for food or pharmacy shopping, to go to work or to walk the dog - one of you!In a way it's absolutely irrelevant what the situation is ref virus, because that is the legal situation in all Spain and it is being enforced by the numerous police"
We came back in December and I had to have paramedics on arrival at Doncaster airport..breathing difficulty...temperature and sickness was in bed 4 days and had 2 lots of antibiotics which did no good ...
"December? So not Covid-19 then., as it hadnt even started to spread in Wuhan until early Janaury. First case outsdie China was in Thailand on 13 Jan - a woman who had travelled from Wuhan.Hope you're OK now.Edited: 1:25 pm, April 05, 2020 "

Hi if you go on to Janet Anscombe site she has a link to the Canarian government site which provides all the up to date information on Tenerife and the municipalities such as Puerto de la Cruz / it’s really helpful
