"Hi, I’m travelling with my family in the first week of March 2020 to Bali. I need an update on the Coronavirus situation in Bali. If anyone has recently travelled or if any of the local people cud give me a reality check. I’m also seeing a lot of mixed opinions/comments by people saying that the Indonesian government is hiding reality and also that since it defends a lot on tourism so it will not reveal the real position. If anyone can throw some light on my issues plz?"
I recommend you work out the numbers and see if what is being reported is possible. Only you can make the decision to travel.
HiI Am a Balinese....Bali is really save now...no coronavirus issue...currently our goverment do not allow Chinese to do the travel to indonesia.
"Just because it hasn't been reported doesn't mean it is not there. It is very naive to think there is not one case in Indonesia or Bali. Before the 4th of Feb, 5000 Chinese were arriving in Bali every day. Do the sums."

"Best to research this issue online, take precautions and make your decisions from there. It’s a vicious virus and no one actually knows the outcome of this, where it’s going and where it’s going to end up."
Check to see if you are covered by travel insurance . The potential costs could be anything they choose.

I understand No Travel Insurance Covers you for Pandemics or War .
Bantam414..There are a few travel insurers that cover for pandemics ( if purchased prior to the cut off date ) TID and Southern Cross were possibly mentioned in a previous thread.
"Yep, we’ve got TID and luckily they do cover epidemics/pandemics, and I purchased before the cut off. I hope I’ll never have to test how good at their word (or wording) they are."
Good to hear that the Australians on Christmas Island have got the all clear to return home.A few interviewed said that they were treated very well by all involved..Great news
"We can't tell you any more than we have. If you are having strong doubts and concerns about travel, then you probably need to postpone your trip.I am continuing my own visit to Bali in a few weeks and do not feel I am any more at risk of any serious health issues there than my own home town."
"Hi Sumedah..At this point there are no reported cases in Bali.There are debates about how this can be but that is another story. It really is up to you to make a decision. We are all "" guessing "" .On a positive note , I dont hear of tourists returning from Bali to Australia who are ill.."
"Hi SumedhahIndonesia is not actively testing anyone other than those who returned from China and quarantined. Most likely there would be some cases in Bali but not widespread. The consolation is that it is not as deadly as expected. The death rate outside of the epicentre in Wuhan would be less than 1%. 70 cases in Singapore so far but no fatalities to date. In 80% of the cases, the symptoms are mild. If I were in your place, I would take the chance and go. Take the necessary precautions of wearing a mask in crowded places and keep cleaning your hands with santisers. You should be fine.Edited: 1:19 am, February 18, 2020 "
"Soulwax, China's National Health Commission reported nothing for a month at the onset, so you can't believe that either!"
"Hi SumedhahIn this particular situation, it really would be irresponsible for any of us, who are ordinary travellers just like you, to advise you to either cancel or proceed with your trip. Sorry, i’m unsure, but would I be right in saying that there have been some confirmed cases in India? If so, surely you would be more at risk in your home country than in Bali"
"Dear travelkat88U didn’t understand my question. Of course there are confirmed cases in India, but at least our government is reporting the same. Whereas there are no reports but only evasive answers as far as Bali government and health department is concerned. Since I’m unable to get an access of their local news that’s why I asked about the virus situation on this forum. Also India is very efficient in medical sciences whereas about Bali I’m clueless."
"You can go to Bali, maybe the positive Covid-19 patients are more in the Australia rather than in India."
I live in bali..and there is no any widespread disease here.. btw i understand your question.. and yes.. some testing are done before in bali for some patients. But all results came negative
"In India there were 3 cases ( students from Wuhan), all were quarantined and are healthy now."
There are 3 Indonesian crew of Diamond Princess Cruise Ship got positive Covid-19.
Hi Ive just returned from Bali today and have developed symptoms. I am currently awaiting to be tested. It is without doubt more prevalent than is being publicly announced due to falling tourism numbers. We spent 19 days in Bali
"Everyone here is so far taking it very lightly, the locals attitude from who I have spoken to is if we die we die, we all have to die anyway. Be happy now.I think it is a matter of material survival above all. I have rescued a dog and so am staying here for her and wondering what to do, my travel insurance does not cover me after April 10, if at all (but they are failing to answer my emails to confirm - World Nomads) so therefore if I get sick I am not going to hospital because I can't pay unlimited amounts of money for health care here... so what to do? If I get sick I will isolate, but that's my only option other than to leave. But if I get sick they won’t let me fly. Catch 22.My house keeper had a son with fever this week and took him to hospital, there was no concern or testing for corona I believe despite that being the first symptom, so who is getting tested and what are the criteria for getting a test? Not sure. “A bali doctor made a statement in the news: Bali doctor: ‘If there’s a coronavirus patient I’ll be infected’ Warning that Indonesian island that has yet to report a case is hugely underprepared.” You can google that and find more details on ft dot com. Financial times.So while there are no current cases reported, and the amount of the population that is affected is much smaller than the population at large, I think you have to weigh up your risks and what you are willing to risk. At present “18% of active cases are serious or critical” according to WHO. You can find the figures on worldometer dot com. …Affecting those mostly who are elderly and have underlying health issues. But there are exceptions.The common flu kills 1% of all who catch it, including very young also… to live or not to live as usual, that is the question…"
"Just going to retract the 1% mortality rate on the common flu, I'm not really sure of that I got the figure from an unreliable source and can't substantiate it."
"Case of mortality rate of common human flu is less than 0.1 percent, whereas Case of mortality rate of Covid-19 nowadays is less than 2 percent and the number/percentage is still decreasing."
"Hi The Simple Life Please,You have written a very strange post, it appears that you are sitting around hoping to catch the virus and it sound as if you are rather disappointed that Bali doesn’t have the virus to pass onto you to give you an excuse to extend your stay. Maybe you should have considered a destination where you would have had more chance of getting the virus.I’m from South Africa and just like Indonesia, we don’t have a single case of this virus, it’s real, we DONT have the virus, our government is not lying or trying to hide something, we simply don’t have it. Maybe it’s our weather conditions that’s preventing the virus from blossoming in some areas, it’s just not know why some countries have it while others don’t."
"You're clearly referring to the same South African government who denies that white farmers were/are being murdered & maimed by the majority, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary? Yeah South Africa is just oozing with credibility on topics of a deadly serious nature."
"I'm well read, up to speed and not in any sort of denial.At the very least you're being honest in confirming how crooked your government is when it comes to matters of life & death.Edited: 4:33 pm, February 27, 2020 "

"Obviously from my posts at 1 and 3, there are still plenty of people in denial about CV being in Indonesia. It's no use being an Ostrich with your head buried in the sand at what is raging on all around you. Statistically, the lack of numbers don't add up. Let's just focus on Bali with 5000 Chinese arriving daily in December, January and 5 days into Feb. Isn't that ringing any alarm bells? That coupled with the fact that many Balinese just won't bother or can't afford to go to hospital to get checked out, especially if their symptoms are mild.So time to stop living in La La Land and get real. Even blind Freddie can see that it is there.As for China's reporting - take that with a grain of salt, as is with communist regimes world wide, having a propensity to lie about most things.Edited: 10:26 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Until nowadays there are more than 800 China tourists in Bali get Special Visa to stay in Bali longer. This is the second times to get Special Visa for every 30 days. If they harmful, certainly government will not give Special Visa for them."
"Yes I also saw that in the local news too. They were literally begging the local immigration department to allow them to stay longer. Lucky that the Indonesian government agreed to their requests.Edited: 1:13 am, February 28, 2020 "
Look for reputable information from real Medical experts. You will not find that on this forum.
"At least China tourists not make any criminal or disturbing, not drunk, not hit the others, etc."
More racist and anti Australian comments from Sarwa G.
"Sarwa - where are you getting your information that the mortality rate is less than 2% and decreasing? I thought they were using the flawed estimate of total deaths/total confirmed cases ie at today 2859/83387=3.4% which would seem like an increase?Not piling on, just wondering where you got your information from."
"Hi Sarah, it is far to early to say what the real mortality rate is. Thee is much skepticism about the figures that China is quoting, and they haven't been very transparent.The fact is that there are probably many cases of people who haven't gone to a doctor as their symtoms are mild (especially at the beginning of th epidemic) hence the reason the mortality rate could be lower.Interesting though that the current mortality rate in Iran is sitting at 10%. You can take those numbers with a grain of salt though, as it is clear that Iran is not reporting/diagnosing everyone who has the virusDr John Campbells vidoes are an excellent resource on the current situation.https:/…about"
"There are daily announcement every day from China and certainly WHO has it too and WHO combined all the data from all the world.Previously when the Covid-19 initial, the percentage is 4 percent and then go down to 3 percent and nowadays is less than 2 percent.There are 2 possibilities:First medical practitioners more know well about the viruses and how to treat it, so patients with positive Covid-19 and get well is increasing.Second the virus is becomes tamer.One Indonesian medical doctor has said that in summer time the virus will be tamer.Indonesia has many experiences of viruses for more than ten years. Dengeu Fever and Bird Flu. Until nowadays there are still Dengeu Fever cases and some of them are extraordinary cases, but Dengeu Fever is sporadic, because the mosquitoes cannot fly so far. There are 2 kinds of Bird Flu. Bird Flu is infected birds and Bird Flu is infected human. Nowadays Bird Flu infected human is not appear anymore, but Bird Flu infected birds sometimes happen sporadically, however birds can fly far away, even across continents."
Hi there .... From WHO : https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2…*WHO did not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.*I'm always read the update from WHO to get real FAQS of this virus instead of searching the news from online media etc ... Hope this help . Stop debate Cheers D

"Of course one Indonesian doctors take on Summer and the effacy of the viruses spread is not medical fact. Hoepfully it is, but at the moment that is not fact."
"Hi Calla,I too have been watching Dr Campbell's reports and find them insightful. I'm aware the mortality rate can only be accurately reported after an epidemic and agree that there may be many cases unreported that would reduce the mortality rate, but as the current average time from first symptom to death is at 14 days the mortality rate could also increase too. The WHO estimated the SARs epidemic mortality rate whilst ongoing to be 4% and it wasn't until its conclusion that it was determined at 9.6%. I was just interested in where Sarwa got his numbers, but it doesn't seem he wants to provide me with that.I too find Iran interesting. It is very obvious their numbers are multitudes off when a decent percentage of their parliament have cases and there are dozens of cases coming out of the country. It does make me think however that as a country it is pretty difficult to hide the presence of the virus for long. Particularly if you're not an authoritarian state and are a popular tourist destination."
"In a pack.I have mentioned before in my posts that the dangerous location is in a cruise ship. I have mentioned it before Iran cases, then in Qom, Iran as holy city for pilgrimage is also get in a pack and get the worst positive Covid-19 with fatality to death outside China.Nowadays all realize that in a pack is dangerous. So Israel Bans Entry to Foreigners Coming From Italy, because most of the visitors are for pilgrimage. Saudi Arabia is also stop to give Visa Umroh."
"Whatever any of us understand and/or choose to believe following serious research about this issue, there can be no doubt in anyone’s mind that this is causing commercial chaos around the world. Of course loss of life is extremely concerning, but it is not possible to prevent people falling ill and dying from countless illnesses."
"Yes Sarwa G. is correct, Saudi Arabia has banned entry for Umroh. I heard they are skeptical about Indonesia having no Covid-19, but who knows.For sports enthusiasts, I also heard that the locally operated BCA Super League Triathlon Bali 2020 has been postponed from April until June due to concerns about COVID-19. My understanding is that this is more about the participants being worried than there being any actual confirmed cases.Also, even though I choose not to travel at the moment with my family, it should be noted that Indonesia does actually have a record of having far less cases of those dangerous viruses of the past 20 years or so than other Asian countries. Bali's tourism industry is suffering right now and the government is offering big local flight discounts to those wanting to travel to Bali, Belitung and some other locations."
"Sarwa, I do agree with you, but what does ""in a pack"" mean? Do you mean people traveling in a large group such as in an organized group to Hajj and Unroh? I think you mean ""in a group""?Edited: 5:55 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"From reading exchanges between Indonesia based foreign correspondents On Twitter, it appears she was in transit for around 1 1/2 hours, Luigi. It’s not clear whether transit passengers remained on the plane during this time. Someone on the forum might know the usual transit arrangements by Emirates?"
"According to the ABC's reports just now , there is a contradiction already on whether the infected person left the aircraft during the one and a half hours in Bali transit.Indonesian health officials say all passengers remained on board .... But Emirate airline staff maintain all passengers disembarked.As usual what to believe when it comes to indonesia?"

"In a pack means more than a group. There are 2 kinds of Umroh and also Haj. Ordinary Umroh/Haj and Luxury Umroh/Haj. Ordinary Umroh/Haj certainly get lower facilities than Luxury Umroh/Haj. Mainly in the accommodation. So in Bali, you will more easily infected in a dormitory than in Nusa Dua Resort area.Saudi Arabia has banned entry for Umroh for many countries, not only for Indonesia."
"Thanks for the explanation Sarwa. I already am very well versed about Umroh and Hajj. Just confusing what you meant by ""in a pack"". For people it is better to say ""group"" or ""large group"" or ""package holidays"". In English, the term ""in a pack"" is usually used to refer to wild animals such as wolves or dogs or hyenas.Edited: 9:22 pm, February 28, 2020 "
Thank you Surfing Wild for your explanation.
"Hi Araluen,I have taken the flight from DXB-DPS that goes on to Auckland. All passengers disembark the plane at Bali. Cheers"
"Today there are 9 flights from Jakarta to several cities in Saudi Arabia, but certainly all are not Umroh passengers. So, Arab Saudi is not afraid with Indonesian passangers, but Arab Saudi afraid if cases in Qom, Iran make pilgrimage persons in Saudi Arabia get also positive Covid-19.It is different with Israel which Israel Bans Entry to Foreigners Coming From Italy. https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international…"
"Hi,Yes, plenty of PAX only travel as far as Bali on this route. Cheers"
"We are committed to going to Bali in three weeks. I accept that there is the virus in Bali. Need to take precautions. The best defence is to wash your hands thoroughly, they say to say the alphabet while you doing it, especially around the fingers and well past your wist. Wash well after going to the toilet and before meals. I am taking up some herbal mixtures to boost my immune system and have natural flu tablets with zinc, vitamin C and echinacea to take at the first sign of any flu like symptoms. If you are from Australia unfortunately any travel insurance purchased after 31 Jan will not cover you for the virus. Playing the odds, 80% of people who catch it have mild symptoms, 20% severe and the death rate is estimated at 1-3%,however this is skewed towards the elderly and those with impaired immune symptoms and smokers. I am not a doctor, just read a lot."

Interesting listen. Why Indonesia has no reported cases of coronavirus. https:/…
I am taking Aquium :)
"That's interesting, Luigi. I checked a bottle of hand sanitiser and it states it is 72% ethyl alcohol. Could you quote the bit where it says you need a hospital grade sanitiser with at least 70% alcohol (to be effective against viruses)? The only mention of viruses I could find was where it stated >90% kills most viruses and is more effective than hand washing."
When a relative was in hospital a few days ago the nurses were only using the pink liquid hand wash/sanatizer as they said the white liquid was inefective against the virus. Of course I don't know the actual name
"hi, i'm Balinesewe are still safe here, until now there has not been a single case of corona virus and most importantly our government will not be able to hide the news if there is a corona virus case because the internet is now everywhere"

What have been your test results?

"Hello, I read your question about travelling to Bali in May, We also have booked to go then, but after extensive research we've decided it's not worth the risk even if we don't get our money back. Unfortunately, as much as we love Bali, and will certainly go again one day, they do not have the medical testing that other countries have, or the number of good hospitals to cope with a possible outbreak. We've decided that we don't want to take the risk of being isolated in Bali, or when we return home. And the thought of wearing a mask on holiday is not for us. But, everyone has to make their own decision. You'll always get people who say it's all a beat up. Our personal decision at present, is not to fly or travel by ship, anywhere until the full extent of this virus is known.Good luckToniQueenslandAustralia"
"Hello Joanne, I read your post about being to Bali and now being tested for Coronavirus.How are you? I hope your results were negative?We are booked to go to Bali in May but have decided not to go because of the lack of testing and health care in Bali. We do love Bali and Balinese people and will go again one day.Hope to hear from youBest WishesToniQueenslandAustralia"
I would not vouch for the accuracy of any testing in Bali. Even the first world countries are struggling to get it right.
I always wear a mask on holiday in Bali ... but mostly as 20m or more underwater most days; nothing to do with my ugly mug scaring the locals
"Really Lee it's way past having any importance about what unqualified people would ""vouch for"" regarding Bali's competence. Fact is they run a world class tourist business that is the gut wrenching envy of their neighbors. Furthermore despite same neighbors' desperation in trying to detect an incidence of this virus among tens of thousands of returning travelers - zilch, nothing, zero. Best concentrate on Australia's very real problems - such as the political landmine of what to do about Italy & your enormously influential Italian heritage community - & leave Bali to continue their clearly more expert control of the situation.Edited: 2:31 pm, March 06, 2020 "

Janice #88 Not sure what medical procedures Aussies are going for in Bali. Dental care and cosmetic procedures perhaps as these aren’t covered under funded treatments at home. I certainly wouldn’t want to use their health care unless it was an emergency situation and I had no choice.

"Glenn B. I became ill in Bali last September/October and was extremely happy with the quality and efficiency of care that I received. It was a lot better than I would have received in Australia, with highly qualified doctors and excellent medications. When I needed a doctor in my hotel room, it took exactly 12 minutes from our hotel calling one, until both doctor and nurse arrived in my room and commenced treatment."
Cbimages I’m so glad you were well taken care of. That’s great to hear that you had a Doctor visit you so quickly.
"Oddly enough, where I come from it's considered offensive to call somebody a ""fake"" but apparently not the case here. My courteouus remonstrances were considered offensive by the ""community"" and removed. Apologies to anybody who was genuiinely offended.An introduction is in order. I'm from Denver and presently sojourning in the hills of Bali for 2 months. It's a two yearly treat & usually works well for catching up with my two sons, who are working in the region - but not so well this time. Anyways my Hispanic self is definitely not an Indonesian nationallistBack to the matter in hand. Bali's health system seems up to the mark for most sicknesses and the local villages (Desa - about 3 to 5,000 people) are pretty impresssive. Each of them in this regency has a well equipped and modern clinic complete with it's own rather new ambulance. There are several sub-villages in each desa and they all have a resident, qualified midwife who also runs a daily clinic and acts quite well for first triage of injuries as well as treatment of everyday ailments. The lady here is on 24 hour call, just like the old township MD.That then ascends to large district hospitals and thence to the major ones such as Sanglah. Most people go to one or other of the clinics or hospitals for sicknesses but there are also quite a few that attend private specialist night clinics for things like ear, nose and throat. Seems quite ok to me and I'm confident they could handle any likely breakout of an epidemic at least as well as many western countries. For serious treatments such as cancer surgery and follow up Chemotherapy it would not be as advanced but treatment that can be given for this virus is not in that domain. There are no doctors anywhere who specialise in ""pandemics""cbimages has already addressed the services available for international visitors and I've nothing to add to that other than mention of the very good Kasih Ibu hospitals - take a look at the suites in the new one at Sabah, the whole family can stay with the patient in luxury. As for the medicos, I have found the young ones to be particularly excellent. Top of the line surgeons, probably not but people who need that go to Jakarta, Singapore or, if it's elective, to Bangkok.Given the situation in countries such as the UK, where virus infected patients are to be treated at home and only hospitalized if severely ill, I don't see that Bali can't provide a similar level of treatment and accommodation for any outbreak. It has quite an advanced economy and the government has clearly reinvested revenues from that in the communities wellbeing. Visiting here is no more risky in terms of avaiable treatment and, based on the facts, the visitor is a good deal less likely to be exposed to the virus anyway."
"Jat Lopez - I went to Kasih Ibu Sabah Hospital to visit an Ear, Nose & Throat Specialist - amazingly, I was able to be seen, as a private patient, just 3 hours after seeing the clinic doctor who made the specialist appointment. The doctor and nurse who cared for me were first rate and my consult and treatment lasted for over 1 hour. All areas of the hospital that I saw were extremely impressive. No way would I have had that kind of service at home."
"#93 / Jat Thank you for your lengthy input, l totally agree with your logic and l read your since deleted post and certainly didn’t find it offensive other than totally honest.Personally l wouldn’t have a problem with the healthcare in Bali as so many people have come away with good experiences. I most certainly wouldn’t cancel my trip as a result of this virus, l could very well pick it up at home and people are totally unaware of the amount of people dying from the flu each year and it certainly didn’t keep them at home."
"Fair enough, Jat Lopez, I apologise for the “fake” jibe and will withdrew that post. We will have to agree to disagree on the preparedness or otherwise of Bali’s health infrastructure to manage should this virus reach a pandemic level there. I would also ask that whoever complained about JL’s post request it be reinstated if possible. (Disclosure - it wasn’t me)."
My worry would be that there are probably quite a few people out there who might have flu symptoms and unfortunately not visit a hospital with their excellent doctors and facilities to get it checked for Covid-19 but instead take basic medication like Panadol Cold + Flu and go about their holiday as if it is nothing too serious.That's not just for Bali but the rest of Indonesia too. But really hoping it remains contained.
Jat Lopez - I have appreciated reading your views on things and agree with many things you say. I have very little knowledge of the Balinese health system. The issues when it comes to Coronavirus seem to be less around staff ratios and staff qualifications and more about availability of expensive equipment. My understanding is a decent number of patients end up in ICU (4-5%?) where they’re not just ventilated but also undergoing other lifesaving measures due to organ failure such as dialysis and/or machines to support the heart (sometimes in induced comas) and receive around the clock care. Certainly no country is well equipped to deal with a massive influx of patients requiring such intensive care but western countries with big health budgets are going to be streaks ahead in terms of availability of expensive life-sustaining equipment.
"I think we are all hearing the same. I imagine this could be the case considering China's hard core control measures. I imagine China will be refusing all foreigners entry to their virus-controlled country in the future, whilst our countries are bumbling in dysfunctional ways to control an already out-of-control virus."
Thank you Baileybum & in a similar spirit I should not have included the jibe about Italy. On reflection I can understand that could be seen as political in Australia. Apologies for being insensitive & look forward to robust but civil discussions with you in future.
"Hi SurfingWild. Yes that'd be me taking the Panadol for a ticklish throat in the not too distant past. Hopefully travelers are now more careful but there'll always be exceptions. Among the local folk in this area there seems to be a high awareness of the virus & they are quite concerned. They tell me it comes up regularly in their banjar meetings, with people being warned to be vigilant and seek treatment immediately if they have any symptoms. It's not a great place for privacy & there's nothing much the village nurse doesn't know about ;-)"
