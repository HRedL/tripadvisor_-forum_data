"Not much has changed since last official update for most visitors coming to territory. Refinery workers who live and work on St Croix seem to be spreaders at their workplace.https://viconsortium.com/vi-experience_the_u…Edited: 2:21 am, July 06, 2020 "
Awaiting the 1pm press conference to see how those with arrivals next week (and later) may be impacted.
"Exactly. For those wanting to follow in real time, you can follow the Governor's address live on FB at the Government House US Virgin Islands page. It's expected that he will provide further information on the proposal to require visitors from certain ""hot"" states to provide proof upon entry to the USVI of negative Covid-19 testing taken within 72 hours of arrival.Obviously there will be ample lead time before any mandate is implemented and I don't think anyone scheduled for arrival next week need have any concerns."
"STT, I am confused. In his ""talk"" the Governor said the restrictions for TX, FL and AZ would take place July 8 (Wednesday), in Q&A just now he said they would take effect Monday, July 13. Which is correct? Where can travelers find official info?"
"In the Q and A he definitely said the restrictions would take effect next Monday the 13th. I did not hear him say Wednesday at any timeEdited: 1:40 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"Tourne - funny, two of us here watched and we both heard Wednesday, 8th (and I took notes). However, I certainly hope you are right!"
He initially said the 8th. Then in the question and answer portion he said next Monday.
What is the protocol if you layover is in Miami?
"Frank that’s what I’m waiting on. Flying through PR, and they require a test for anyone flying in. But I hope it’s not just for connections."
Pretty sure he said that the restrictions only apply if one of those states is your state of residence.
I’m traveling July 24th and we are finding that unless we are sick and have symptoms we cannot get tested and if we do the results are taking 5-10 business days to get back!
"Yep, I was in DC last week and could not get Covid tests. Our state of residency is Florida. The good news for us is that we are leaving and returning by boat.Cheers, RickG"
You cannot get tested in Texas without symptoms either. Will they be offering the tests at the airport like some in Hawaii have mentioned?
"For those who can't get a test, have you tried private labs? What has been the result?Private labs here offer tests for a fee, but I haven't checked recently for requirements.I'm trying to find the transcript of Governor's address and will post link if/when I find.Edited: 3:27 pm, July 06, 2020 "
Just got word that governor's update transcript isn't ready yet. I think they have English and Spanish versions which they release at same time.
"There are 9 of us coming and I reached out to try and postpone our trip with our villa and they declined the o honor our request. We are running into the same issue . Turn around time and trying to get tested and if you are asymptomatic, do you have any options? I appreciate this forum. Thank you so much it is very frustrating and we leave July 22 from Texas"
Just trying to confirm that the new restrictions from the 3 red states don't take effect until Monday?
In AZ our tests are coming back in 5-7 days (whether private lab or big name lab). The state has been out of rapid tests for the past two weeks.
What about getting the antibody test? He did say they would take that as well.
"We are trying to come 7/19 from Texas. It is not possible to get a test in Austin if you are healthy and don't fall into the high risk categories based on age, medical condition or exposure. This includes public health, private labs, our personal physician, and home tests."
"I'd like to know how they will verify what state you are ""originating"" from. I live in and am coming from Missouri, which is not on the list, but I am flying into Florida for an overnight layover (and will be staying there at the airport hotel) and then have a separate ticket the next day from Florida to USVI. I'm concerned they'll just look at that ticket and say that we came from Florida."
The antibody test will work if you have recovered from the disease and are positive on the test.
"Visitors whose residence is Arizona, Texas or Florida will be required, effective Monday July 13th, to have either a negative PCR 72 hour test OR a positive antibody test (which lasts for 6 months). If you do not have either of those tests available upon arrival you will be required to quarantine for 14 days. This mandate will be in effect from Monday July 13th for two weeks."
"If we cannot get the test, is it possible to get the test there as gov said on Friday or the only option is to quarantine?"
"It only applies to RESIDENTS of those states. Not people flying in from those states. So as long as your ID isn't from any of the restricted states, you're fine."
"Hi STT,Did you find the July 13th date as the official date? Have lived in a bubble for weeks preparing for arrival this coming Saturday. First time back in 6 years but this bomb dropped today is shutting down our options as nobody can get results in less than 5 days and can’t find rapid testing. Texas, Arizona, and Florida have fewer active cases per 1000 residents than other states not on the list regardless of any recent spikes. Math is math."
"I'm reporting exactly what the Governor said today. If you don't have what's necessary as of July 13th then you'll be asked to quarantine for 14 days (I'm assuming self-quarantine). I'd suggest you check the USVI Government House FB site tomorrow to see any additional details or clarification and if you can't find what you need there then you can contact Government House via the page or call directly at 340-774-0001.If you're arriving this Saturday, July 11th you have nothing to worry about."
"Thanks! He said the 13th but his slide said the 8th. That’s the confusion. If he’s going to make it impossible for travelers to prove they are healthy (a reasonable request given ample time) then he should also mandate refunds be provided to ensure there is no doubt there. The 13th is reasonable but 72 hours isn’t given the current turnaround time for test results. Might as well shut it down completely.Edited: 6:10 pm, July 06, 2020 "
I reside in Texas and our trip is July 22
I wonder if you have to quarantine in st. Thomas or can you take the ferry to St. John and quarantine there? Also is it possible to wait to get tested til you arrive in stt and are there tests available and how long does it take to get results. Tourists certainly don’t want to exhaust the testing supply on island but if they can’t get the test at their state of residence and can’t get their deposits back It might be an option. Such a nightmare.
The Governor’s office is supposed to be putting out a statement this evening confirming the testing requirement start date as July 13th.
Pending specifics I would assume the quarantining is self-quarantine and of course if your destination is St John then you would self-quarantine wherever you're staying on St John.
"A few clarifications would help.1. The governor clarified to a caller today that July 13th is the first date requiring test results on arrival from AZ, TX, FL , despite his slide saying July 8th2. In past VI consortium broadcasts, testing on arrival was discussed...is that an option?3. Is there a proposed quarantine location or is there a quarantine in-place order? what exactly does that mean? As the governor pointed out in the past, most visitors only stay 5-7 days. Where would they stay after the rental is over? Are they allowed to take public transportations,"
"This was posted on the Virgin Islands Consortium facebook page:""Given the influx of incoming travelers since the reopening of the territory and flight increases at both airports from major airlines like Spirit, Delta, and American Airlines, Governor Albert Bryan updated the territory on Monday, stating that the new travel restrictions announced in part last week will take effect next Monday. The governor also announced a temporary ban on new incoming contractors for Limetree Bay. Last week, a total of 21 coronavirus cases were reported at the oil refinery and storage terminal, located on the south shore of St. Croix.""So, next Monday July 13th is when the rules take effect."
For all my ARIZONA peeps. Covid testing with a 15-hour turnaround is available at Embry Women's Health. Despite their name - they test both men and women. Appts are filling up fast.
We also are from Texas and have a trip booked to St. John on Aug. 10th.
"Brennaabroad - I am doing the same. It was the only way the flights worked. I’m thinking we will bring our state driver’s licenses in addition to passports. How will they know in STT that you spent the night in Florida? We will be staying in our FL hotel room to sleep then back to the airport in the morning.Edited: 8:51 am, July 07, 2020 "
"CarolSLC, it is based on where you reside, not from where you traveled."
"I actually messaged the Government House on facebook, and got this response:""Governor Albert Bryan Jr. said during his weekly COVID-19 update that beginning Monday, July 13, individuals who are residents of, or whose travel to the territory originated in Arizona, Florida, or Texas must present test results showing they are negative for COVID-19 or positive for COVID-19 antibodies upon their arrival into the territory.""So again, I'm not sure how they will determine where travel ""originated"" from. I will be arriving the 11th, so I should be good, but for people in a similar situation who arrive the 13th or later, I think some further clarification will be needed."
"I don't think it's too complicated. If you're a resident of those three states the rule applies. If your flight originates in any of those three states the rule applies. Connecting flights in those three states don't apply.If the rule applies and you arrive without the required proof you'll be required to quarantine for 14 days. Likely this is the same quarantine rule which applied to returning residents and visitors who came here during the rental accommodation ban. Stay in place (at your rental accommodation if that applies) and confine your association with other people to immediate family, only go out in public if absolutely necessary. Mask up and observe social distancing. Presumably if your visit is for less than 14 days you'll be self-quarantined for the length of your visit. Nobody's going to be following you around checking on you, not likely you'll have your forehead branded - but if you're caught out mask-less and wildly frolicking in a crowd then obviously there will be consequences!"
"Yes, but in the case of flying from a safe state to Florida on one ticket, and then the next day flying from Florida to USVI on a separate ticket, your trip did not originate in Florida, but according to your ticket to the island, it did. They're not connecting flights; they're separate tickets. I would hope that as long as you show your other ticket that shows you came from a different state originally, then that would suffice, but I would be concerned about it unless/until they verify that."
"Had antibody test today should get results in 3 days so faster than the actual covid-19 test. If positive are we allowed to travel to SJ on July 16th as planned? Whom is going to be asking for the test results and at which point in our travels will this proof be asked to be shown? At the STT airport? At the SJ ferry? or upon arrival in SJ, thank you."
You will present proof before you leave the airport on STT. Requirements are a negative PCR 72 hour test or a positive antibody test.
"Latest update from government house says if you land without proof of the tests, they will offer you a test at the airport. No reason for all the panic."
"I know people will be offered a test or quarantine, but haven't seen information that test will be performed at airport."
"If tourists arrive without a negative test in hand and are tested on arrival, will they have to quarantine until the results are provided? If they have to quarantine, will it be on St. Thomas or will they be allowed to travel to St. John? This plan is hard to understand."
"The procedures are still being worked out, but it may depend on whether they have access to the rapid results tests. There will be more info forthcoming."
"It will be interesting to see the turnaround time on the tests available in St Thomas. We managed to wheedle our way into getting tests at our doctor but it will not be back until we have been on St John for 3 to 5 days. If the test in St Thomas is quicker, we'd rather do that. I do not know what expenses would be involved here or in St Thomas for the testing."
"CanoeRat, your problem in TX is apparently lack of testing kits and other supplies and your state is doing something around 9000 tests a day which is gargantuan compared to that in the USVI. Normally I would wryly respond with two words, ""island time"" but (a) unless we have a massive uptick in test-less visitors arriving from TX, AZ and FL and (b) given that arrivals from those states are only a very small percentage of our visitor total, you're probably looking at the same time frame.The quarantine is self-quarantine in your vacation accommodation provided of course that you're asymptomatic. Have the test done in TX and a few days of self-quarantine means that you simply stay close to vacation home base, confine your interaction to those with whom you travel, observe all sanitary advisories and only go out if absolutely necessary.Hope that helps."
Is the governor giving another update today?
"Hi STT Resident. Your comments spurred a thought... Since we are having a difficult time getting test results in TX within the 72-hour window, do you think it would be possible to take the test in TX before leaving, show proof of having already taken a test upon arrival in STX, self-quarantine at our rented condo until we get the results via email from TX, and then (assuming all are clear) go about our vacation with the remaining days we have left on the island?Perhaps that is what you were saying in your last comment, but I'm just trying to clarify it for myself. If that's not what you were saying, is that scenario a possibility or not? I'm not even sure it's a good idea, or that we would even want to travel under those conditions, but I'm just trying to ""think out of the box"" as they say and salvage our family vacation. Thanks!"
"Sandra - that's our plan. We're getting a test done 3 days before arrival but it includes a weekend so we don't expect to get the result for 2 to 4 days after that. By the way, PCR tests tends to be finicky and give a lot of false positives (initially up to 30% but current tests are better), depending on the test, the skill of the technicians, and the cleanliness of the lab. The PCR technique is better at identifying real cases than at ruling out infection. So cross your fingers and hope you aren't one of the unlucky ones who aren't infected but get a positive test :-)"
"Sondra D, that's exactly what I meant. Without proof of a negative PCR or positive antibody test you'll automatically be on self-quarantine for 14 days and will have to work out the details of getting the results once you receive them to whoever needs to see them. I'd suggest you contact Government House directly for specifics and confirmation. You can reach them via their FB page - Government House US Virgin Islands or by 'phone at 340-774-0001."
I have tried since Tuesday to reach the Governor’s office and no response as yet.
"Thanks, CanoeRat and STTResident for the input. It gives me something to think about. I'm still looking for better testing options in TX. Due to the cancellation policy on our condo rental we've got until the 18th to make a decision before we have to either commit or pull the plug. I'm sure the news for those of us who come from the three ""high infection"" states won't get any better in regards to USVI entry requirements anytime soon but I hope no one else gets added to the list."
"Sandra- my thought would be as long as you have confirmation of a negative test after arrival you would be fine to go about your business after receiving the results. It is a mandatory quarantine but not supervised, this isn’t going to be like Hawaii"
"Thanks, TournesolSJ. We are currently weighing our options and looking to see where (if anywhere) we can get a rapid test before departure. I guess we'll wait until the governor speaks next Monday to make our final decision. I doubt we will risk coming without the test unless he says the on-island testing for tourists will be the rapid results kind (which I'm not expecting). sigh!"
Governor updating today at 1 pm.
"Thanks, Ms411. I'll be sure to tune in!"
Thank you MS411 - I thought it was yesterday. Will be sure to tune in as well as we supposed to arrive tomorrow.
"Summation of today's address:Effective Wednesday July 15, visitors from Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina and Texas will be required to present a FIVE DAY negative PCR test, or a positive antibody test taken within the past four months.These are all states which Johns Hopkins has established as having a positivity rate of greater than 10%. More states may be added as Johns Hopkins continues to update its findings daily.Any visitors who arrive from these states who do not have the necessary documentation will self-quarantine for 14 days or until local testing results are received. While many states still remain short of testing kits and results are taking longer than max 72 hours, the USVI testing is right now getting results in 24-72 hours. Because of that delay stateside the time frame for being tested stateside has been changed from 72 hours to 5 days.Visitors with questions can now call a dedicated Tourism hotline at 1-800-372-8784.Locally, all bars are closing immediately. Bars in restaurants can continue to serve drinks to dining patrons but there will be no more sitting at or standing around bars anywhere.All gaming centers and casinos throughout the territory are closed immediately.On weekends and holidays, beaches will close at 4PM, just as they were over the last holiday weekend."
"They added 10 more states to the list. I couldnt' remember all of them but I know South Carolina, Kansas and Idaho were on itEdited: 2:20 pm, July 09, 2020 "
"Also, I believe I heard the Governor say when asked by a reporter what will happen if things get worse, something to the effect that they could close hotels and stop the arrival of tourists. So it sounds like another shutdown is not out of the question.Since our planned travel is still 3 weeks away and anything can happen we have made the decision to get a travel voucher for our airline ticket, cancel our condo and car rental for a 100% refund, and perhaps try again at a later date. I've never been to USVI and will hope and pray for another opportunity.Thanks to all for the information while trying to sort this out."
"Nikki K, the states are as listed as of today."
Thanks so much I see them now.
"So when they say all bars are closed, do you think that includes the ones on St. John that also serves food? I wonder what the distinction will be."
All bars are to be closed. Bars in restaurants will remain open to dining patrons but there will be no sitting at or standing around the bar permitted. You can get your drink from the bar and take it back to your socially-distanced table.
"We are due to arrive Tuesday and our state is currently not on the list for testing. My question is this, and is directed to those on-island and those who own rentals on-Island: During the shut down, was there a transition period between shut-down announcement and the period at which even existing reservations were not allowed to come to their rentals? If the reservations system were shut down Monday, would that most likely mean we could not come Tuesday?"
Reservations made before the previous shut down were honored if visitors could get a flight. The airlines cancelled many flights when reservations were suspended.
Thank you @ Ms411!!
We’re coming Tuesday 14th also.
"There was I think a two week warning before closure last year?I don’t think you can walk up to the bar and get a drink, have to be served at a table. Various restaurant bars are blocking their entire bar counter today.Edited: 8:37 pm, July 09, 2020 "
