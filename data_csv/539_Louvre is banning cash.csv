"Bring your plastic. As a temporary health measure, the Louvre is not accepting cash. Versailles still is as of now.https:/…"
Strange that there are no mention of this on the Louvre website in French or in English.I wonder if it's true...
"You heard it here first, so hopefully it will be corroborated soon. According the story: ""The Louvre confirmed Wednesday that the museum will no longer accept cash, although it also noted that half of its tickets sales already take place online.""“Cash is finished,” said Andre Sacristin, a union representative at the Louvre. “It is a temporary measure during the epidemic.”"
As silly a move as imaginable but I suppose it makes workers feel better to think 'something' is being done.
"The Louvre now has COVID-19 advice for visitors on its website:https:/…covid-19-advice-visitorsIncluded in the advice is a link to the government's coronavirus information page:https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirusEdited: 1:43 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"This was posted on France 24's website yesterday about the Louvre re-opening:""In a statement, the world's most visited museum said that, faced with the “legitimate concerns” of staff over COVID-19, it had agreed to take “extra measures” to ensure the safety of employees and visitors alike.The museum did not specify what measures were adopted, but a union representative said staff had been given hand sanitisers and would not be required to handle cash at the till.""https://www.france24.com/en/20200304-louvre-…"
"I doubt that many people will challenge this sort of measure, but it is my understanding that it is illegal to refuse cash payments for any amount less than 1000 euros (just as it is illegal to accept cash for any transaction of 1000 and above). A ""health emergency"" might make the decision at the Louvre legal, though."
