You are a patient one yvr1.
"Well I tried. There was no answer to the question for days, I didn't even know what he was asking about, so I googled it. I am also retired so now I have lots of patience.Edited: 9:39 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"A gold medal to you yvr! Not only is it a first post, but it isn't even travel related... not really, when the OP has listed Vancouver as his location."

"Too bad you felt the need to do that yvr1 , I'm surprised the OP stayed up as long as it did. But then, only 2 or 3 people know the secret formular for post removal.Now, what's the story behind the new avitar?"
"oh, I thought I would change it for fun. Being originally from San Francisco and have ridden on those streetcars, I thought the picture was sort of cool. The background is the Ferry Building, that is where all streetcars turned around for their outbound trips. I am a bus, train, and streetcar fanatic.Edited: 1:58 pm, April 10, 2020 "
"Well, if we dig, we find we all have something in common, don’t we?Post WW II, I rode the interurban streetcars from Vancouver to New West, where we caught the Pacific Stage Line bus to Mission. I was born to an engineer on the steam logging trains of Englewood and I have a family picture of a Bloedel Stuart and Welsh logging train, on our homestead near Powell River in 1911."
"That is very interesting, yes, many of us have ties to things that are the same or close to it. I was fist introduced to the Vancouver streetcars back in the very late 40's or very early 50's when I visited Vancouver for the first time. I rode the Arbutus line to downtown. It was, as I said then ""neat"", loved the ride."

"Someone didn’t like this post, the first time…it lasted two hours. So few threads to run up the post count, I guess the time has to be filled somewhere.Anyway yvr1, here you go, 1911 wood fire locomotive at Myrtle Point, south of Powell River. That’s me old grampa sittin’ on the roof.https:/…Here’s an oil fired workhorse (a Baldwin, if memory serves) operated by my old man through the 40s at Englewood.https:/…And, you didn’t ask but here is my first air travel, from Alert bay to Vancouver. It was on a Supermarine Stranraer, more fondly known as the whistling outhouse, owned by Queen Charlotte Air, founded by Jim Spilsbury, a well-known BC pioneer.https://tinyurl.com/vx9pf59We sat on a bench along the side, our backs to the damp fuselage. Our feet were right on the aluminum floor, which was its hull. I will never forget the feeling of landing on the water, as the floor wobbled up and down like a whipped rope. If you ever roller-skated on a shingle roof, you know-o-o-o the fee-ee-eeling.https://tinyurl.com/vx9pf59"
"Absolutely fantastic photos, thanks so much for sharing. I am also a airplane geek, love to fly, forgot to add that above in my post. When I started out, I could barely look out of the window, and my hands were glued to the arm rests. Now, flying is like riding a bike once I got over my fears, I love it. Can hardly wait for my next International flight. Hopefully I live so long."
"The logging trains I rode as a youngster in the Nimpkish Valley, were very similar to Engine 374 in the Yaletown roundhouse, except they were narrow gauge.Though I had already seen float planes, it was in Alert Bay, at about age 4, that I first heard then saw, a Seabee; strangest thing ever; not as fast as a float plane but noisier than 10. It landed on the water and ran right up on the beach. When it left we thought it would never get off the water and would break every piece of glass in the village.https:/…Republic_RC-3_Seabee"
"Thanks everyone, I found it at Revolucion Style in Yaletownhttps://revolucionstyle.com/"
