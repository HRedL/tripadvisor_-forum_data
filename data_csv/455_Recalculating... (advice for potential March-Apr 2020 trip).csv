"Hi everyone,You might have seen me before in the forum, I had a trip planned for Sakura season this year, but as with 99% of the people, my trip was postponed due to COVID-19 situation. I am potentially planning a new trip next year (not booking my flights until there is some further clarify on the situation) for around the same time, and will probably have some extra days for my itinerary.For the moment, we are planning:Tokyo - 6 days (including side trips to Nikko, Fujisan, and also including Ghibli and teamLab Borderless museum).Kyoto - 5 days (including side trips to Nara and Himeji)Koyasan and Osaka - 3 days (1 + 2)Miyajima - 1 dayNakasendo, Matsumoto and Jikogudani Monkey park - 2 daysTakayama, Shirakawa-go, Kanazawa - 3 days (with more time in Kanazawa than Takayama)My question for you is, If you had 1 more day in your itinerary, where would you add this day? And what If you had 2, 3 extra days? (still in the planning phases but all those are possibilities - we would prefer to add these to any of the places listed to make it more ""relaxed"" but we are open to any suggestions - Kamakura, Kamikochi, Okayama for example are in our radar but don´t want to pack too much to be honest...).Thank you very much as always!Mariano and Flor, from Argentina"
"In the current situation, you still might need a day to wait for the results of the PCR tests. They are saying that they might ask for a certificate of prooving you tested negative but they will check at the airport again.Edited: 8:19 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"Adding a day in Hiroshima might be a good option. With a couple of extra days you could build on your Okayama/Kurashiki idea and add Takamatsu and a day trip to Naoshima if that was of interest. That could also make your Himeji side tip fit more smoothly.Kamakura is a bit of a double up on Nara IMO and can be done from Tokyo easily (including Enoshima).With your time in the Alps, look at the route pretty carefully, it is easy to waste time back-tracking unnecessarily."
"Hi Global, thanks for that. Good to know and for sure we need to take into account all of these as possibilities...Thanks as well Japan Custom tours, I will research further on the places you mention that we weren’t considering. And yes, in the alps our idea is to almost don’t backtrack (we would do Nakasendo - Matsumoto (side trip to Jikogudani)-Takayama-Shirakawa go-Kanazawa)..."
"1-4 Tokyo, including TeamLab Borderless, including 1 day using the bus to get to Kawaguchiko (pick a clear day) for Mt. Fuji5 day trip Nikko6 Monkey Park, Nagano, onto Matsumoto for the night7 Kiso Valley day trip8 Matsumoto Castle in the morning, bus to Takayama, afternoon at Takayama9 Takayama10 Shirakawago 1/2 day, onto Kanazawa11 Kanazawa, suggest you train to Kyoto in the evening to maximize daylight hours12-15 Kyoto, spend 1/2 day at Nara16-17 Hiroshima/Miyajima18-21 Osaka, including day trips to Nara and Koyasan. Himeji Castle is also an option if you want to spend a 1/2 day22+ Any extra days are gravy. A 14-day JR Pass will pay off from day 5-18. Head to Nara or Himeji on 18 since they can be covered by the JR Pass. If you visit Okayama and Kurashiki, do so while going to or from Hiroshima. Koyasan is not covered by JR Pass so there is no need to include the journey within the 14 days."
"The Alpico bus serving Kamikochi usually resumes service (after winter) from mid to late April. If it fits into your travel timeline, visit it as a day trip while staying in Takayama.Edited: 3:48 am, June 09, 2020 "
"Excellent, SammyFD. Thanks for taking the time, that looks really good to me, I will probably end of doing something like that. DLI, thanks for the Kamikochi suggestion, I think I will be out of Japan by mid-April though so might not be able to do it this time (maybe next time when I go back for Koyo season).Any additional suggestions are more than welcome!"
"Agree that Hiroshima shouldn’t be excluded while visiting Miyajima.Late March to early April is a very good time for enjoying cherry blossom in Japan. Although a lot depends on the unpredictable weather and we had missed the season a few times, last year we had a memorable sakura trip to the Kansai region during early April. Besides a self-drive road trip in Awaji Island we spent 7-8 days seeking out some beautiful cherry blossom sites in and around Osaka and Kyoto. Take a look below at some of our trip photos and see if anything is of interest to you. https:/…"
"Thanks very much William and hfot2. Yes, we had been in two minds about Hiroshima previously, but will certainly visit the city while we are staying in the area, probably dedicating two days to Hiroshima + Miyajima so we don´t have to run that much. Based on your suggestions and some further research on ours ide we are looking at the following itinerary right now:March 25: Half day in Tokyo (arrival)March 26-27-28: TokyoMarch 29-30-31 / April 1-2: KyotoApril 3: KoyasanApril 4-5: Miyajima/HiroshimaApril 6-7: OsakaApril 8: Nakasendo, finishing the day in MatsumotoApril 9: Matsumoto and Jikogudani, moving on Takayama in the afternoonApril 10: TayakamaApril 11-12: Shirakawa-go couple of hours enroute to Kanazawa and then KanazawaApril 13-14-15: TokyoThat would be it our rough idea the moment I believe as it would give us some probability of being able to observe Sakura at least somewhere based on previous years (I know it´s not guaranteed), but still very much open to any further suggestions you might have! We might have 1 additional day but this is still under confirmation.Thanks for all the help!"
"If you have extra time in Hiroshima worth a visit is the Orizuru Tower for a panoramic view of the city.https://www.orizurutower.jp/en/For the latter half of the itinerary after the Kansai region consider going to Kanazawa, Shirakawago and Takayama before Matsumoto. Keeping Matsumoto a bit later on the trip hopefully you can do a side trip to another lovely cherry blossom site – Takato Castle Park. Sakura season there is usually best during mid April. This spring the park was closed and its annual sakura festival was cancelled. Finger crossed everything will be back to normal in 2021.https://takato-inacity.jp/2020/ With an extra day during the second half of April another popular destination is Kawaghuchiko with its annual sakura festival. fujisan.ne.jp/up_img/…if_ex_f_00000001.pdf"
"That is excellent William, will be taking a look at those places and taking into consideration putting Matsumoto a bit later. Might be a great idea,Thanks so much! Crossing my fingers as well that this is possible!"
"The sakura in Takato Castle park ruins is more fickle - peak dates might vary by more than 1 week, due to its inland location and sakura variety. Have visited it twice.you may refer to my sakura visits to Matsumoto Castle, Takato Castle Ruins Park, Kawaguchi-ko etc in 2019.japantravelinsights.com/jp-2019-april-sakura…"
"Thanks DLI and hfot2 for the insight. Indeed it seems to be an amazing place while in bloom judging from the pictures, though it´s also good to know it´s really difficult to coincide with a sakura viewing there, so we will evaluate how much of a risk we´d like to take.Thank you!"
"Covering Nakasendo, Matsumoto and Snow Monkeys in two days sounds like a terrible rush to me. It would be better to use more time there than visiting Takato, which is quite tough for a first-time visitor to cover.Snow monkeys might be better to combine between Nikko and Kanazawa because you're supposed to go there from Nagano. From Nikko, you change the Shinkansen at Omiya.Edited: 2:02 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"Hi Global,Thanks for your insights. Actually, the only thing we were initially really looking forward to see/visit in Matsumoto is Matsumoto castle, so a more detailed plan of those days was the following:Day 1: Departing early from Osaka, arriving at Magome around 10:30-11:00 AM to start our Magome-Tsumago trail of the Nakasendo (we might spend the night in Nagoya If that´s better for the itinerary). Take bus from Tsumago to Nagiso, and then train into Matsumoto, arriving in the afternoon. Our idea this late afternoon/night is to take a walk around Matsumoto and mainly visit the illuminated castle.Day 2: Depending on how much we liked the castle, and because we´d probably like to see it during daylight, we will do an early morning there for some pictures and then go to Jikogudani, through Nagano station, maybe spend a couple of hours there and then go to Takayama in the afternoon.Day 3: Full day in TakayamaDo you still think it would be too packed or that it´s a bad idea taking these ideas/interests into account?"
"To me, your plans look fine. Nakasendo is going to be a day trip regardless. The only suggestion I can make is to get there earlier if possible. Get to Matsumoto in the late afternoon (fine after closing) and see it from the outside. Plan on seeing the Castle itself on day 2 morning. It shouldn't take no more than an hour. You should get to the Snow Monkeys by 2-3pm. Buy a bento and Eat lunch while riding the Shinano Express if necessary to save time.You should not plan on reaching Takayama that evening though. Without dissecting bus schedules, you simply won't make any of the last buses. Your best two options are 1) visit Nagano after the Snow Monkey Park to fill up the rest of day 2, then head back to Matsumoto to overnight, bus to Takayama next morning; 2) from Nagano, take Shinkansen to Kanazawa. Bus to Shirakawago/Takayama next day. You could consider using Kanazawa as your base and just do day trips."
"Visit Snow Monkeys on the way back from Kanazawa to Tokyo instead of visiting from Matsumoto, which you will need two hours and a half more. Many people love to stay at Shibu Onsen close to the Snow Monkey Park."
"#9,The itin proposed by Sammy in #4 would be ideal to cover all those if you depart from Osaka/KIX. However, if you have to return to Tokyo prior to departure, consider this after OsakaOsaka > Kanazawa (2n) > Takayama (1n) while dropping by S-go for a few hours > Nakasendo for day trip via Nohi bus and then travel onward to Matsumoto in about 1 hour by JR Shinano express trainhttps:/…Matsumoto (2n) – apart from visiting the snow monkey park as a day trip, consider also the Mt Koboyama ancient tomb (弘法山古墳の桜) @650m where there are 4000 sakura trees, apart from the Matsumoto Castle.https:/…While in Tokyo, visit Kawaguchi-ko for peak sakura in mid-April on a clear day for views of Mt Fuji.My last sakura visit in Fuji 5-lake in April 2019.japantravelinsights.com/jp-2019-april-sakura…"
"Thank you for your thoughts Sammy, we plan on getting to the Nakasendo trail section we´d like to do as early as possible now. One idea we have is to spend the previous night in Nagoya or near Nakatsugawa If possible. And yes, getting to Takayama in the evening seems tough.Thanks for your thoughts as well Sammy and DLI. Maybe we could add one night in an onsen in the area to make that section of the trip more relaxed... Shibu Onsen seems like a fantastic idea (and we´ll probably enjoy Shibu onsen + Jikogudani more than going to Nagano for the afternoon/night). Maybe we could do:Day 1: Nakasendo trail and spend the night in the areaDay 2: Go to Matsumoto and spend the night thereDay 3: Go to Jikogudani and spend the night in Shibu Onsen (or back in Matsumoto), moving on to Takayama the next morningOnly problem with this is we´ll be short of ""early mornings"" in Takayama, which we wanted in order to take pictures without many people there..."
"Day 2 after Matsumoto, go to Takayama. The morning market at Takayama is popular among the tourists.Put Jigokudani after Kanazawa. Matsumoto to Nagano is one hour at least by Limited Express. If you put it on the way to or back from Kanazawa you can save time."
"That could certainly be an interesting option, thanks again Global!"
I rate Takayama morning market as just ok. Whether you find that really enjoyable depends on what other markets you have visited worldwide. Many of the town/village markets in Europe were much more interesting to me. Taking pictures early in the morning is a good idea though.
"#20,Given you'd travel almost half the globe, for onsens consider also these1. Shin-hotaka onsen in Okuhida for views of snowy JP Alps (in April) on clear days - frequent Nohi bus from Takayama2. Kawaguchi-ko for views of Mt Fuji on clear days."
I didn't care going to Takayama morning market myself but it is often introduced as quite popular with the International tourists. The buses are limited so check the timetable.https:/…
"#24 DLI, thank you for your suggestion. I hadn´t heard too much about Shin-Hotaka but been doing some research after your recommended and it seems like a fantastic way to spend a relaxing day in the area.The thing with Kawaguchi-ko is I´ll probably do it as a day trip to maximize the chances of being able to see Fujisan. I´m worried that spending a night there and then having the mountain 100% covered all the time is not our ideal way of doing it...#23 and #25 - Yes, I am not that interested in the Takayama market itself, but particularly in the old town alleys without too much people in the morning (that´s why I wanted to spend a night there and not rush to Takayama as a day trip from somewhere else).Thanks everyone! Fantastic insight from your part,Edited: 7:51 am, June 12, 2020 "
Shinhotaka is a great place but you really need to check the bus timetables well.https:/…https:/…
"#26,The Shin-hotaka ropeway is fairly popular though check out live camera on its website before you go from Takayama. On clear days, head up to the top observatory @2100m for panoramic views of the snowy JP Alps.http://shinhotaka-ropeway.jp/Indeed, it's 50-50 to stay overnight in Kawaguchi-ko for views of Mt Fuji. That's why I always stay 2 nights in a roll in my last 3 stays.If you prefer to avoid crowds, avoid the Takayama Spring Festival.https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html"
"I also think that it's the best to visit Kanazawa after Osaka, where you can enjoy Cherry Blossom in early April after Kyoto/Osaka, and then visit Takayama via Shirakawago, and Matusumoto before coming back to Tokyo. It's a good idea to either stay 2 nights in Kawaguchiko or day trip Kawaguchiko from Tokyo in mid April when you can enjoy Mt. Fuji with Cherry Blossom, as follows.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2bAy40RtHYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x4Zxz4eQMk"
"Thanks DLI and Global for the suggestions and advice on Shin-hotaka, will take that into consideration, the panoramic views seem fantastic If the weather is fine.Thanks also Mabei (#29) for your suggestions on Kawaguchi-ko and Kanazawa after Osaka. The thing is it´s really difficult to re-configurate all the trip to prioritize full bloom in most places... that´s what I´m struggling with for the moment..."
"Just for further info, what I was basically trying to prioritize is full bloom (as per ""an average year"") in the Kansai region, to mainly visit Kyoto-Osaka-Nara-Himeji with the most chances of having nice Sakura...Based on this my current itinerary was:March 25th to 28th - TokyoMarch 29th and 30th - Hiroshima & mainly MiyajimaMarch 31st to April 2nd - Kyoto (1st leg)April 3rd - KoyasanApril 4th and 5th - Osaka (Day trip to Himeji)April 6th and 7th - Kyoto (2nd leg)April 8th - NakasendoApril 9th - MatsumotoApril 10th - Jigokudani and then onto Takayama in the early afternoonApril 11th - TakayamaApril 12nd and 13th - Shirakawa-go (1/2 day) and KanazawaApril 14th to 17th - TokyoDuring the time assigned to Tokyo, actually we plan on going to both Nikko one day and Fujisan one other day. We might probably be too early for full bloom in Fujisan If we visit as day trip in the second leg of Tokyo at the end, right?The idea behind dividing Kyoto in two is to avoid the weekend there and to maximize the chances to see Sakura by spreading our time in Kyoto a little bit further.And we´re still in two minds about Jigokudani itself, as it seems much more beautiful in the snow that some photos I´ve seen of people visiting in April...Also, timing wise, I understand this would give us good chances of Sakura viewing in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka maybe Miyajima and the Matsumoto area as well.Edited: 2:11 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"For peak sakura in Tokyo and Kyoto, I always recommend end Mar/early April in former and early April in latter based on yearly average. Even if the Somei Yoshino - the main variety might bloom earlier probably due to global warming in some years recently, the late sakura varieties are gorgeous at well.Better move back your arrival date by a few days by landing in Tokyo after 28th March. Matsumoto - better after 11th April.One of my sakura visits in Kyoto and Tokyo targeting the late ones in mid-April.japantravelinsights.com/jp-2017-sakura-kyoto…Himeji castle can be visited in a few hours while travelling en route b/w Hiroshima and Osaka.Edited: 9:17 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"Hi DLI. Yes, I´ve been considering that as a possibility but If done like that it would be more difficult for us to have 22 full days in Japan and we´ll have 20... (due to some National holidays we would take advantage of in our home country). This year we were actually planning on doing just that (minus Miyajima + Hiroshima extra 2 days which we added here for our potential 2021 trip),From what I can see on the Sakura reports of the last 3 years though (reference: Japan Guide reports):- Tokyo seems to have full bloomed between 25-Mar and 01-Apr (2018), between 28-Mar and 08-Apr (2019) and between 22-Mar and 29-Mar (2020).- Kyoto seems to have full bloomed between 28-Mar and 03-Apr (2018), 05-Apr and 08-Apr (2019) and 25-Mar to 01-Apr (2020).In our current potential itinerary, we have :- Tokyo between March 25th and 28th (which on the last 3 years would have got us either early blooming or full bloom)- Kyoto in two stages: 31-Mar to 02-Apr, and then on Apr 6th + 7th (which on the last 3 years would have also got us either early blooming or full bloom),Feel free to let me know though If you think this wouldn´t be a sensible way of preparing the itinerary to increase our changes of Hanami (not sure which is the best reference/website to check previous years patterns of sakura blooming).Thanks for all your comments and advice! Super appreciated!"
"Under the current situation of COVID-19, the full bloom spots could shut out people so take it easy."
"hey Global. Of course, not putting my hopes up anymore with this year´s cancellation of our trip for sure (I am currently working on drug development against COVID-19 so I´m fully aware unfortunately...). The unpredictibility of the situation could mean no tourists for a long time coming into Japan, but one can dream with the help of fellow Tripadvisor people right?"
"Thank you hfot2 for all the detail. That is certainly super helpful as well. I was indeed referring to the Yomei yoshino accordingly. However, I understand there are early and late bloomers, and I´m sure we´ll enjoy them a lot should we into those. We´ll see... for the moment just daydreaming about it all, hope the world can recover from all this nightmare and that people can travel the world while feeling safe again...Thank you for your thoughts, lots of people also in the frontlines against this disease making a lot of effort in fighting against it.And again, thanks everyone for helping so much in the planning stages. Japan is certainly such a fantastic country.... hope we can convert our plans into a reality in the near future (and also of course hope I can help you should you travel to anywhere in Argentina or to Barcelona at any time...)."
"I think you thought I mentioned about the travel restriction but not that, even that is quite possible.They closed the East Gardens, sakura avenue of Ueno etc. around March 27 this year.The observation deck of Chureito is still off limits. The administrations wil l take measurements to avoid people gathering."
"Thanks Global. I wasn’t aware of the Chureito pagoda deck restrictions, perfectly understandable though. Let’s see what the following months bring us! People are starting to go out a lot and gather a lot as well in several countries now so it’ll certainly be a test... so hope everything goes well"
"The Japanese will avoid ""gather a lot "" to save lives.  Economy matters so some places are reopening but it doesn't mean it safe.Change the air by opening the windows even when it' s cold. Keep safe!!"
That´s for sure good advice Global! Hope Japan can get back to normal and that the economy is not impacted extremely hard as it´s happening in my country (Argentina):Have a good day and stay safe!
"The best to move in Cherry Blossom Season in Japan is to make your final itinerary after you see the Cherry Blossom Forecast from mid January as follows, https://www.japan-guide.com/sakura/But, you have to book your hotel in Kyoto much earlier: in October (@6 months before), at least until 2019.Many new hotels opened in Kyoto in 2020, so you might be able to book it later for the next Spring."
You will definetely need a day to wait for the results of the PCR tests near the airport. So far they are asking 14 day quarantine without using public transportation. There might be some change by next year.Japan is working on with a faster kits but the acciracy is not that high yet so they might stick to the usual method.
"Hi Global, we will definitely be looking for any updates regarding this PCR requirements. Not sure we`ll be going into Japan If those are still in force closer to the date in which we plan to leave. Will be considering our options in the next couple of months (we live literally 30 hours away by air to Japan, so risking getting a positive result because of contact with people throughout the trip is not impossible at all, so we`ll see...).Thanks for all the data! (What I`ve found so far is the following but I suppose there is also additional information in Japanese-speaking media which I might be missing):https:/…"
"So far there are talking about the business people from Vietnam, Thailand, Australia and NZ. They will require a doctor's certificate saying that the test negative and when they arrive at the airport in Japan test again.Everyone has been tested if they arrive after April 3 at Narita or Haneda. The news says that they found people coming from Russia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Brazil test positive almost every day.https:/…page4e_001053.htmlEdited: 1:11 am, June 15, 2020 "
"Most booking sites and hotels in Japan usually only allow booking from @3, 4 months before. But, it's better to book your hotels earlier in the high Cherry Blossom Season. Japanican, run by JTB, the largest travel company in Japan, which allows booking from 186 days before, is a convenient site to KEEP your hotels in the high season, as follows. https://www.japanican.com/region/japan/kyoto…If you find a better deal later in other sites, you can cancel it FREE until at least 1 well before even in the high season."
"#45 - Thanks Global for the extra information and also for the reference. It seems to be a very dyanamic and with new rules with every day depending on where each country is standing... Better safe than sorry, as they say!#46 - Thanks so much Mabei. I had heard of that 3-6 month thing for several places to stay, so thanks very much for confirming! I think under our current circumstances, the possibility of free cancellations / refunds If COVID-19 cases spike again is a need. For anyone in the same situation and using Booking.com for example, their policies are below:https://www.booking.com/covid-19.html"
"That´s a good point hfot, Booking.com is sometimes a bit obscure regarding their explanations about what is free to cancel and what not, and what is charged upon arrival at the hotel and what not. In my case, I am making sure all of the ones I booked are free to cancel, so no worries from my side but it´s for sure good advice to everyone out there to double and triple check before they click on ""Book"" button."
"Not booking is the best way to handle with it. There is no way to do without PCR tests at the airport next year unless COVID-19 disappears, which is unlikely.Edited: 9:16 am, June 16, 2020 "
"Probably so Global. However, in case we do have the optimistic scenario where things start opening again and the virus eases its impact in the world (as it has happened with some other recent epidemics/pandemics), most of the places will be fully booked by then and we will be left with the worst options, at least in the usual highest season of Hanami. I still think booking in advance is a sensible option at the moment, nobody really knows what´s going to happen unfortunately (for good or for bad)."
That kind of optimistism lead to the high numbers in other countries.　　Japan won't do away with the PCR tests at the airports any more.
"That is certainly a sensitive measure, preventive diagnostics should lead to better control of cases for sure. Stay safe everyone!"
"Sorry, but my hunch is saying that the South hemisphere will see higher numbers once it goes into winter.You can start booking after you see Japan starting to open to tourists or you need to deal with the day at the airport next year."
"Of course I hope you´re wrong :). Although the cold and drier conditions are better for several virus families, I understand it will mainly depend on how quarantine goes for each country (we are not famous in Argentina at least for abiding to the rules unfortunately...). The COVID-19 testing in the airport will for sure become the norm in many countries and it´s for sure what I would do If I were the Japanese government, still we have the possibility of booking in advance as we would do under other circumstances, that´s the key of Booking.com and so on, at least on the client´s perspective... (we are still 9 months away from Sakura season 2021 though, so I will keep the booking just in case and will make sure I cancel 1-2 months in advance at least If the situation goes worse, to make sure it is not detrimental to the hotels/hostels/ryokans),"
"I don't think we need to discuss the travel restrictions and look into the crystal ball too much in *every* itinerary thread. As long as the poster understands the potential risks involved, it's fine to plan. Whatever one decides to book, make sure it can be canceled for free."
I'm just saying travellers to Japan need to plan with the first day near the airport as I wrote at #43.
