Been to WDW and Universal many times.But right now Florida is the most dangerous place in the US.There are more new cases and deaths in Florida than any state.We are not going again until there is a vaccine.I especially worry about all the folks in the UK who seem determined to come.Do yourself and your family a favor and wait a year .Florida is only going to get worse for now.Be safe!
It’s clear to everyone that the US is not dealing with the virus very well? Right?
Perfectly clear
Thanks for the public service announcement....mom.
"I can’t be the only one who thinks Disney will delay opening, am I? Another daily record for Florida set with today’s reported numbers almost 11500."
"“I can’t be the only one who thinks Disney will delay opening, am I?Another daily record for Florida set with today’s reported numbers almost 11500.”I can’t believe the other parks are still open."
I can’t see how they can open safely. Cast members union has asked them to delay so surely they should look at the number of cases and back down. Why is it that most places in the world the cases are going down but they keep increasing in Florida? What are they doing or not doing that they should be? The best thing anyone can do to let Disney know they are wrong to go ahead is to not visit.Hard to do I know but put your family and loved ones before a ride at a theme park.
The mind boggles..
The grocery stores like Publix are reporting when they have an employee positive at a location. Several restaurants have too. But I am not aware of a single report that an employee on a Universal or Disney property tested positive. That’s statistically impossible at this point. Which leads me to believe The parks are not being transparent about positive cases.
People from the U.K. and elsewhere actually can’t enter the US at the moment for vacations so it’s not us travelling that you need to be telling.Just a quick read through the entire Florida forum will enlighten everyone as to why the virus is spreading so rapidly over there. People need to stay home for a while and stop spreading it about.

“·People from the U.K. and elsewhere actually can’t enter the US at the moment for vacations so it’s not us travelling that you need to be telling.”?i don’t know how Trip Advisor is organized but the Orlando page is for Americans too.
"Hi bchSorry if you’ve misunderstood my post - or course the forums are for everyone, the op however mentioned ‘especially worry about all the folks in the UK who seem determined to come’ - point is no matter how determined they are, they can’t at the moment.Imo Florida needs to batten down its hatches and try to get serious about lowering those frightening numbers. It’s so hard to believe the way things are at the moment - we were there this time last year the the biggest worry was would the rain hold off for the fireworks.Happy Independence Day everyone and stay safe."
There is no need to worry about the folks from the UK. They can't get to Orlando at the moment.
"I'm kind of torn on everything relating the virus.I'm from Australia so obviously here we have a pretty good grip on it, sans Victoria which has had a recent spike due to 1 stupid person spreading it around and saying it is all a hoax.So here things are getting ""back to normal"" as normal as it can be. I watch the USA from afar and think OMG still spouting off about their freedoms and rights and spreading it and spreading it to the point that everyone will soon have it.But then I think, well maybe that is the only solution, I'm not sure this will ever go away. I don't know if a vaccine will be found so sooner or later aren't we all going to have to do this? Spread it around? We can't live like this forever - no one wants that.The issue is that we don't yet know what the long term effects are if you survive it. They don't even know yet if you can get it again, and what about serious lung damage etcIt's a scary time that's for sure.I think we've all had trips we have had to cancel and for me it has lead to a bit of depression. But we must keep safe and just hope for the best."
I think the point was that people in UK seem to be obsessed with getting back to Disney. Might be wise to just put it all on hold.
It’s been said over and over that the intent of shutting down was never to stop the spread. Medical professionals came out quickly and said it was going to spread regardless. The intent was to slow it down so that everyone isn’t sick at the same time needing the limited resources that each hospital had. Chances are good that at some point we will all catch this virus.
Tenni you’ve hit the nail on the head there. It would have been lovely if Covid just evaporated during lockdown but that was never the point of it. The point was to not overwhelm healthcare systems and to build increased capacity.
"Some countries did get rid of COVID (see Taiwan, China, Japan, Germany) for all practical purposes.Too many Americans behave selfishly rather than for the good of society.Some people have bought the government's line that we should give business free rein rather than contain the virus. The irony is that the countries that have not contained it have a worse economy now than the ones that contained it."
"Which Germany do you mean, this one??""""The coronavirus reproduction rate, known as the R number, has jumped to 1.79 in Germany.The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health confirmed the rate was now far above what is needed to contain the outbreak over the longer term.The R number equates to how many people, on average, will be infected by each person who has COVID-19.If R is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but if it is below 1, the number of infections shrink and coronavirus can be brought under control.An R of 1.79 means 100 people who get the virus will infect 179 othersThe development is a setback for a country viewed as doing much better compared to many other EU nations in the pandemic due to its early and widespread testing procedures.""""This was last week in June..The virus is not going away any time soon.."
"Germany definitely did not ever get rid of the disease. They kept numbers initially very low, but then it started to increase, hence Mike’s R rating.The interesting thing in Germany is the 2 sides of Berlin. The East side had an earlier version of the BCG vaccine over the West side. The West side had a later version which most of Western Europe had. It was technically a better vaccine. However the Eastern European 1st version led to recipients gaining a higher general better immune system. The numbers in East Berlin have been far lower than in the Western side. I got this info from a TV interview with expert 2-3 weeks ago, numbers may have changed since."
The exact reason I'm not going until October 2021
It's obvious people touching the same public doorknobs and such can't comprehend that you need to wash your hands.

I think it might never be safe to go back. It is very sad.
"Travelyme,I hope and pray that you are wrong but things in Florida are getting exponentially worse as the days go by. It will take a vaccine and that looks years away. The undue haste to open up has created a perfect storm that has allowed the virus to gain a foothold again. The debate about the pros and cons of mask wearing Can now be looked at with incredulous disbelief as the rush to protect an economy instead of health has backfired big style and my booking for next July is looking optimistic.Edited: 12:21 pm, July 05, 2020 "
"Dangerous is very relative, i personally dont find it dangerous, open the border!!!!!"
"Of your list of 4 Taiwan is only one that has come close. Germany runs at 100’s of new cases a day, Japan locked down areas last week and China has Beijing partly locked down. Driving as close to zero is what can be done. Whilst it is circulating in the world the way it started will still be there, importing cases by travel."
"Come on guys we will beat this. Our parks will be safe one day. We all have different opinions on how to get there, but get there we will.We will all have different options on when it’s safe but it will be safe again."
"Hundreds of thousands of people have died from this terrible virus. Hundreds of millions of people have lost their livelihood because of lockdown measures. That’s why governments are reopening. It’s not a case of eradicating the virus, that will never happen until we get a vaccine. It’s a case of making sure the health services won’t be overwhelmed. We’ve passed that stage so we need to reopen carefully. This post is a statement of fact and is not expressing an opinion."
"Nick66Uk, I am glad that you are not my doctor or in charge. I live in Canada very close to the US border. Our border with the US has been closed for three months. The vast majority of Canadians do not want the border to reopen until next year at the earliest."
"Luckily, the decision won’t be put to a vote. The border will be opened when Canada finds it economically needed, which will be sooner than the “vast majority” want. Money runs the world."
I do wonder what would happen if we just opened everything and carried on as before all this began.I am not saying we should do this but some experts are of the opinion that herd immunity works. If everyone was exposed and caught it for most it would be mild and treated at home but the world would not be shut down and businesses could carry on. There would be more deaths but hopefully no more than at present. If no vaccine is forth coming in the next year I fail to see what else we can do.
"On “Dangerous to go to Orlando?”With more than 10,000 new cases already today, Florida now has more cases than every other state except New York and California.Source: worldometers"
"Marilynandmick,We are not animals to be treated like some herd. Darwinism is alive and well. Oh dear!!!"
"Fluffy, I did say I was not saying this is advisable but many experts have said if there is no vaccine forthcoming then that is the only other way to go. Otherwise the world could be in lockdown forever and more people could die as a result of the lockdown rather then the virus itself."
Unfortunately I think herd immunity would kill off the elderly and medically vulnerable at too high of a rate to be acceptable. Take a look at Sweden’s stats.
"Herd immunity only happens at very high rates of previous infections. For measles it’s 92-95 percent of people need to be infected to stop the spread. No one know what it is for Covid19 but likely 80% at least. This is assuming immunity lasts and it does not mutate. The US has had 2.9 million confirmed infection, but that is only 1 percent of the population. We are no where near herd immunity."
"On “Dangerous to go to Orlando?”With the Governor’s tone toward others, he may have thought he is smarter than visitors from outside the US, or from inside the US and outside Orlando, or hotel investors from wherever. But coupled with the data, low-occupancy hotels and mounting contagion—the predictable fruits of his strategy—they do not help people want to spend money in Florida in order to risk their safety..Edited: 3:39 pm, July 05, 2020 "

"This is not a chicken pox party to invite your kids along. It’s a disease that attacks the most vulnerable, the people who deserve our care and attention."
"Tenni, I know we are separated by our understanding of the English language but you quickly worked out in your next paragraph what I meant. You didn’t need to ask."
Again herd immunity is still what needs to happen to move past this. The problem becomes the anti vaccine population which has continued to grow. A vaccine won’t help if half the population refuses to get it. And then we will be in the same boat we are right now.
"It's not just the anti vaccers that are the issue, the issue is that they don't yet know if you can get it again. All these people saying ""once I have it and it's gone means I can go about my business"" they don't really know that yet. You may get it again, and it could have long term effects on your body as well, they are studying this right now to see if you can be re-infected.Again, I don't know what the solution is, but shutting everything down for years isn't the answer, nor is going about your business like nothing is happening."
But herd immunity will take years naturally to accomplish if it works. Quicker with a vaccine if that happens.

"Happy to report that I am back from a weekend at the beach. No social distancing, no masks and still alive and kicking. Beaches were packed and restaurants were busy. Not like a typical 4th, but still lots of people out. I did notice that in most grocery stores there were probably 80% masked. I say 80%, but if you only counted people that were wearing a real mask and wearing it correctly it was probably around 10%. So to answer the OPs question, no Florida is not dangerous and yes we understand that."

I wish they would do the sensible thing and have a proper lockdown like the rest of us have had to endure in most of Europe. It hasn’t been pleasant but in the lockdown it seems the most sensible way socially and economically to control the spread of this virus.In the long term it will be better for the area and allow Orlando to return to a new “normal”. Just now it just seems irresponsible and no one will visit due to safety worries this more damaging in the long term
"betha, It is ok. We will be over this soon enough and make it through. The upside about this is that when we are over this in Fla, we can move on while the rest will still have to fear the flu. At least you will be able to visit Orlando soon and be reasonably safe from the locals."

"LittleBiffOne, get a life. Seriously. This is a travel forum."
"Travel spreads contagious disease, so it is always dangerous in a pandemic.

Visitors who place themselves above community standards are the greatest danger."

Please don't add to the millions of other nag posts out there. If you have specific knowledge about the area, add it. If you want to nag and argue with all the other political hacks, do it somewhere else.Is there Covid in the area? There sure is, Is it increasing? yes. Are there limitations on what is open? yes.

Please stop bumping this thread up over and over just to post links to news stories.At least two of us have actually done Trip Reports of what it is like to be a tourist on the ground in the last week or so. That is what the spirit of a travel forum is about. Actual travelers sharing their experiences.We all know how to pull up the news websites and I am sure we all have our own covid tracker websites book marked by now too.The news is sensationalist. It is all about the clicks now. Just as it is clear that you continually bump posts for seemingly no reason other than to up your own post count.I certainly listened more to my friends and family on the ground in Orlando. To actual Cast Members that I know working in the resorts. To guests already on the ground with posts that included videos and photos of the safety precautions before making my own decision on whether it was safe or not.

"One of my main questions and something that every time I see (and i have seen it a lot) I get baffled by. Travel agents and airlines seem to be releasing stupidly cheap packages from the UK for Florida next year (around March/April) for families, As someone that has been to Florida a few times I know the prices are beyond extortionate for a standard UK family of 4 to go to WDW for a few weeks. So when the airlines and travel agents are releasing these bargains that i keep seeing, it's no wonder people are snapping them up and booking to fly over. I booked early this year for April 2021, but we're looking at cancelling and moving to the September 2021 instead for safety reasons obviously, but the airline we booked the package with have not contacted us once in regards to the risks, outbreaks, rising numbers in cases etc that are currently happening in Florida, I suppose my point is that with airlines and travel agents releasing these deals from the UK for pennies, more people are likely to book (more money for the airlines and travel agents) but also more people travelling in and out of the state.

The Americans that agree with your world view those that get their news from Facebook and believe everything they say on the Today show because they talk to ""Experts"". I would assume that is where you are getting your US information as well. The US is a very large and diverse country with different environments, topologies, densities, etc. It isn't a one size fits all country. Even in Florida there are vast variations which is why you see the virus flaring up in the south, but in the north not so much. Hospitalizations are low and the death rates haven't changed. In the state death rates are still very low which is a fact that the news media glosses over because it doesn't scare people into tuning in. Of course my view is my view. It is formulated by someone who is out in the world every day and I share what I am seeing, not what I hear on the news."
"""Honestly the entire world is looking at the USA and thinking ""what the hell"" you might not like to think that, but we are""Honestly most Americans really could care less what the entire world thinks of us. We also could care less of the judgement that someone is passing on us based on what they see on the news which is usually not telling the entire, accurate story of what is really going on."
"Post 96, Display Name (UK)“We're looking at cancelling and moving to the September 2021 for safety reasons obviously, but the airline we booked the package with have not contacted us once in regards to the risks, outbreaks, rising numbers in cases etc that are currently happening in Florida.”1. Your concern for current safety information merits respect. a. Contact tracing--valuable if not essential to control pandemic--may now or soon be impossible in Orlando and Florida due to the severity of statewide infection spread already. This discussion is sobering. https:/…index.htmlb. For UK-US: there are now more than 10 times as many cases in the US as in all of the UK. Florida alone already has about ¾ as many cases as the UK, worldmeters, with the margin narrowing. At current rates, Florida cases may exceed 300,000 before the end of the month. c. Data in this thread and elsewhere can give you information on “risks, outbreaks, rising numbers in cases etc” that you seek. 2. The lack of transparency you mention does not inspire confidence. The extreme price-cutting may be a barometer of the safety risk you want to avoid, rather than a coincidence. 3. For Orlando traveler assurance: a. The Florida Governor recently said he would not “take any responsibility for Florida’s skyrocketing coronavirus***just hours after the state recorded its highest single day of new cases with more than 10,000.” (post 61), and “everything’s all right with Florida’s pandemic response“ (post 65). b. As reported in The Guardian, https:/… the President recently said “99% of coronavirus cases are totally harmless”, a representation to travelers at variance with the understanding of the scientific community in many countries. A four-step approach might implement your safety concerns: 1. Cancel or postpone your trip for now;2. Plan beginning next year--when you will have then-current data on infection transmission--as the parks re-open; 3. Follow the statements of the Governor and the President as you wish; 4. Consider information on a safe and effective vaccine or medication beginning next year —which may then be that much closer to realization.  Viewed this way, time, medicine and peace of mind are on your side. Best wishes on your trip.Edited: 9:19 am, July 07, 2020 "
"“Honestly most Americans really could care less what the entire world thinks of us. We also could care less of the judgement that someone is passing on us based on what they see on the news which is usually not telling the entire, accurate story of what is really going on.”Maybe in your circle most people don’t care. I assure you that they do care in mine. We look like idiots with all the unnecessary bickering. So many other countries have gotten a handle on things- just look to our neighbors to the north! They got on the same page and didn’t throw hissy fits about their “personal freedoms” or declare it a mere “hoax”. I’m embarrassed that we couldn’t accomplish the same thing here.Edited: 1:25 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"Beth, There is no country that has a handle on this. Any country that claims that they have has a false sense of security because until there is vaccine or a certain percentage of the population gets infected, they are vulnerable. It is simply not sustainable to hide forever and at some point these countries that you think are in control have to open up and they will be at the same point we are now. I don't know if you ever played Hide and Seek as a kid, but at some point you had to come out. Hiding is not an end game solution."
"You seem to favor herd immunity, sunn, but as discussed earlier, it won’t work without the loss of (what I feel) is too many lives. It was the plan Sweden was going with and both their case count and death rate do not support it as a valid option."
Question: has anybody ever changed their opinion on Covid because of what some stranger posted on the internet? Ummm...didn't think so. How is this not entirely exhausting for you all?
"Sunngod,There are so many people posting here who think they can do whatever they want. That is why it is both dangerous and irresponsible to travel to Florida now. Countries like Taiwan have stopped transmission and can do most everything with some precautions. As shown here, there are many people in Florida who are going around without precautions BEFORE the virus has been contained. That is why Americans are not allowed in the rest of the civilized world. However, the Americans who should be embarrassed by their lack of self-control are shameless."
I live an hour away from Orlando. Given how our government officials are handling the pandemic here I can only advise that people stay away unless you have essential business here. We are breaking records on COVID cases daily. Many people still believe the virus is a hoax and refuse to take any precautions.
"Beth,I only favor herd immunity since it seems to be the best and only option short of a vaccine and that doesn't seem to have a lot of hope. I think we would all deal with the madness if there was a real possibility of that happening. Heck, even I would wear a mask if I thought there was a real chance at a vaccine. While yes it is sad that to get herd immunity that people will suffer, I weigh that against the suffering if we don't. The long term effects and suffering to save a few, I don't see as a better option than hitting this head on and getting life back to normal."
"Most Americans do care about their community and protecting all of their fellow citizens. Some don't care about anyone else and obviously therefore don't care what anyone thinks of them. They have that right, but they are delusional if they think their actions don't endanger others."
"From Fox News: https://www.foxnews.com/health/herd-immunity…Nothing is certain regarding this virus and anyone who tells you otherwise should be avoided. The only certainty is to wash your hands often, wear a mask around others, social distance as best you can, and to respect others."

"I've got a trip booked for August and am not cancelling. I'm not in the ""danger"" range and am not too worried about catching it or spreading it.

"I guess I don't get all this back and forth crap about mask, no mask. If you are worried about catching the virus then stay home like many people have already stated. It's a simple solution. I have worked continuously through this thing since the beginning. I have been in contact with thousands of people, and I WEAR A MASK at all times, except when I'm home. I will be leaving for Universal Monday morning for 4 days. If I catch it, oh well. I could easily catch it here in my home state of Indiana by touching a door handle (if what they say is true) I'm in this for myself, and it might sound selfish, but I don't care. I have to wash my hands, I have to NOT touch my face and I have to wear a mask. If someone doesn't want to wear a mask, it's on them. I am not their protector. I can only protect myself. Oh, and please don't tell me I wear a mask to protect others. Just 3 short months ago we were told we didn't need them at all."

"Few may have noticed that 42 percent of all COVID deaths in the US come from just three states—New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts. These three states account for nearly 56,000 of the nearly 133,000 deaths in the US, even though they represent just 10 percent of the population. If these three states are excluded, the US suddenly finds itself somewhere in between nations such as Luxembourg (176/1M) and Macedonia (166/1M), where some of the better fatality numbers in Europe are found."
"""Travel if you want, but don’t delude yourself into thinking the person you infect at a grocery store had much of a choice.""They did have a choice. They went to the grocery store. In this gig economy, you can basically live life at home without leaving your bubble."

"Considering that poster is the DE for a city that also really suffered from this disease, I am nearly speechless."
"So the argument that the heat will kill it has been incorrect as has the laissez faire approach to wearing a mask In public. So the OP is right, don’t go to Orlando just now, if Florida was a country it would have the fourth highest of infection in the World and right now it’s dangerous."
15000 Florida infections reported yesterday. That’s up from just 2000 at the end of June.
I dont think the message has sunk in - all you need to do is read through the main Florida forum and see people planning their visits as usual - the virus doesn’t move people do! Unless people start taking personal responsibility this is going to get worse and a worse for everyone.I saw a comment that now seems to be deleted about someone not caring if they infect other people - once they themselves are careful and can have a good holiday. What on earth is that sort of attitude about?The world is looking on at the US in horror. It’s very sad to see this happen.
"15,300 new cases""Wake up Florida"""
dubfam.The post about not caring if they infect others is still up but the posts saying how bad people thought that attitude was have been closed.Work that one out!
"comment #115, she says she's not in the danger group (anyone can get it of any age so not sure what she's talking about?) and so she won't get it or spread it. Pretty selfish statement."
"People under 40 are dying. Shes just stupid.The virus loves stupid people who dont wear masks, and dont social distance."
I find it interesting that several regulars have come to Florida recently or are planning trips yet no one goes on their posts and tells them how horrible and stupid they are.
"The regulars know what is going on in Orlando and make their decision. At least one recent visitor was very up front about still taking precautions and following guidelines. The one time or few time posters likely don’t have any idea what’s going on in Orlando or outside of their state. It’s very easy to not notice news if you don’t want to or are not looking for it. I had a friend checked in to a flight to my state, when I informed them that we were back in red zone, they cancelled. Two days later their state announced a quarantine on travel from my state that she would have had to follow. People just are not always aware what’s going on in other states."
"I was saying stupid for not wearing masks, not for going to Florida."
"Today is my last day of 14 day quarantine. I either didn't catch it, or I am one of the lucky ones that are completely asymptomatic. I followed EVERY precaution I was told to. I was religious about wearing my mask over my mouth AND nose at all times outside of my hotel room and in the pool. I practiced social distancing to the best of my ability and I removed MYSELF from situations where I felt people were getting too close, too crowded, or too lax.I may have felt it was safe enough to risk getting it myself, but I sure as heck would feel terrible if I were responsible for spreading it to anyone else. That is a terrible attitude. I chose to go to Florida, no one at the grocery store chose to (that I know of), so I did what I was asked and I removed myself from society for the time requested of me for my decision.I do plan on scheduling a COVID test to be safe before I rejoin society, but I don't think I did anything exceptionally risky. It would appear that people that do what VERY LITTLE is asked of them by wearing a mask, washing your hands, and trying to distance can actually function in this new normal safely. It's the jerks that don't want to do their part that make it dangerous.My trip in just over 2 weeks is still full steam ahead at this point. If I find the parks dangerous, I will just have another in hotel vacation, and then quarantine another 2 weeks when I get home. I now know that it really was easy to do and a small sacrifice to get to vacation again. I also realize that I am completely fine with having to cut the parks out and change my plans on the fly, so only people that are willing to do that and possibly spend all this money to just hang around the hotel should attempt a trip right now."
"Everyone loves to throw out numbers. But what those blanket numbers don’t tell you is that south Florida counts for almost half of all the cases in the entire state. Miami Dade, broward and palm beach counties make up over 110,000 cases just between the three of them. Orange County has almost 1.4 million people and has had about 18,000 cases. That means about 1% have tested positive. Yes people should be taking precautions and continue distancing. But let’s have some perspective here."
"A few weeks ago the numbers in south Florida were closer to what central Florida is seeing now. The virus doesn’t care about city and county and state borders, and when there are large groups of people not being cautious it will start to spread,Edited: 6:51 pm, July 12, 2020 "
are excluding 4000 infections each in Osceola and Seminole counties. And the 14% positive testing rate in the Orlando area which indicates the virus is spreading rapidly.
"Just spent a weekend in Orlando, it’s a ghost town (relatively), only other time I’ve seen it like this was in the months post 9/11. Quite a relaxing experience compared to my hometown beach city in the panhandle that has been running above normal crowd wise since early May."

Sounds like people are having trouble social distancing at DisneyWorld. Orange County CA does not have as much spread as Orange County FL but Disneyland’s reopening has been postponed indefinitely. That should tell you something.

"Folks, shouting from your armchair at those who wish to travel and then call them dumb and selfish probably isn’t accomplishing anything. Do you really think that mindlessly repeating the numbers and opinions of how dangerous FL is will convince anyone wanting to go to stay home instead? In addition to many folks on here who are actually capable and interested in answering specific travel questions, there are also people who have traveled to the state recently and who can provide valuable feedback on how travel has changed, where things were done well and not so well, and on what precautions need to be taken (whether mandated or not) during the trip and upon return. In the end, that might be a considerably more effective and productive approach. Just my two cents."

"""Do you really think that mindlessly repeating the numbers and opinions of how dangerous FL is will convince anyone wanting to go to stay home instead?""Do I think that reporting numbers that show the absolute failure of the Trumpy governor of Florida might help some people decide to stay home. You bet I do!"
"Doesn’t matter what I consider selfish or not, the point is calling someone that is not going to accomplish anything (other than get more posts deleted). We could attack everyone who chooses to travel (someone even decided to delete their legitimate travel question yesterday presumably based on the responses they have received) or we can answer questions and provide info on the precautions that other travelers are taking. I would argue that the latter is a considerably more productive approach."
"Nothing said here is going to change anyone’s mind. If someone wants to go, being a keyboard warrior isn’t going to change their mind. There are plenty of sites available for finding numbers.

Many a combat veteran has returned from the war zones unscathed for 100's of years, however I must ask is a war zone somewhere you would voluntarily travel to ? Twice as many Americans have now died of Covid as in the entire Vietnam conflict,isn't this area of the country now a war zone ?? As of noon today there are well over a quarter million cases and 4,300 deaths in Florida since March due to covid. Central Florida: 46,281 cases"
"Responding to the question, “Dangerous to go to Orlando?”Following 15,299 new 1-day cases this weekend, today thus far Florida has a 1-day total of 12,624 new COVID-19 cases.This 12,624 cases is also a majority—56.7%— of all 22,282 new US cases reported thus far today. worldometers."
"I haven't done a lot of things in the tourist areas as it has been deadsville. Actually, I'm curious about who isn't being compliant. I saw a few things here and there over the weekend, but the vast majority of places where I went were compliant including one place that can get very busy.I really want to see the bars that are able to follow the restaurant rules open again. There are several places that I like that have responsible business owners and that know how to follow rules. Unfortunately, they can't open. That is the shame. Enough is enough.

That belief may turn out to be a myth, of concern to those who may have been inclined to follow it.A study published today in the Journal of Adolescent Health found 1 in 3 young adults (age 18-25) is at risk of severe Covid-19 infection.

"“Dangerous To go to Orlando? Does everyone understand that?”Half of the states have state-wide mask requirements (including Alabama)—but not Florida, even as its statistics sky-rocket.Some families are uneasy about safety in Orlando and Florida. Arguing against requiring masks is In my opinion not responsive to need, not persuasive and not reassuring to visitors. Families concerned about masks and safety might consider: https:/…214698541a34Edited: 7:54 am, July 16, 2020 "
More death? Where in the world do you get that?
Florida wasn’t fine at the end of April. No we didn’t have the record high cases we do now but it was still very much a concern. Everything was still shut down and no one knew when things would open back up. And yes I do get health problems but you have some responsibility as well. The virus has been prevalent this entire time. There was no way it was going to be gone in 60 days. But the fact is things are open now. It’s up to cancellation policies now to see if you get money back. It’s not their fault that things are open and you waited to the last minute to decide not to go.
Florida just had a one-day high record for deaths. The Trumpy governor is doing a great job there.
"Little, You should really be questioning the effectiveness of the masks considering the numbers are increasing even though 90% of people are wearing masks. Not really sure it is doing more other than providing a security blanket. Just because it isn't required by law, doesn't mean that people are not doing it."
"Well sunngod ""Once things warm up, the spread stops"" didn't exactly work out for everyone did it? Can't blame people for wearing masks when the people who are telling us they aren't effective gave us that assurance a few months ago."
"Re: Post 218""Little, You should really be questioning the effectiveness of the masks***""1. The virus spreads by transmission. Stay-at-home, quarantine, distance, avoiding crowds and masks thwart the transmission. If marks are uniformly used--in addition to other safeguards--the transmission of virus from infected persons, and resulting illness and death, can be reduced. 2. On Tuesday, the CDC released, ""CDC calls on Americans to wear masks to prevent COVID-19 spread"", https:/…p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html3.

"That is great Little, but can you explain why everyone is wearing masks and the numbers keep going up? Not really concerned about what people are telling people to do. I'm pointing out that people are doing what the experts say and the numbers keep going up. What is next? We must wear goggles because the virus can spread through our eyes?"

"On the tiny chance that it's not a troll question, symptoms lag infection, and deaths lag symptoms. You can't expect to see a measurable drop in infections until masks have been warn by a large percentage of people for a number of weeks. And you haven't reached that point in Florida.It took us a month of everything being shut down in Massachusetts and required masks in essential locations (grocery stores, drugstores, healthcare facilities) until we saw positive tests start to drop."
"Northern_Traveler00 in Post 224 makes a vital point: that the measures, which are cumulative and supportive, take time--and require a very high level of compliance to be effective.In addition to Northern Traveler, I defer to Dr. Fauci. In this chat with Mark Zuckerberg today, Dr. Fauci said;“I would recommend as strong as you possibly can to get people to wear masks, to avoid crowds, to keep distances, outdoors always better than indoors,” he added. Done right, mask use and social distancing can help turn back the recent resurgence in cases in many states, Fauci said.Edited: 6:37 pm, July 16, 2020 "

“ until masks have been warn by a large percentage of people for a number of weeks.

Most were doing it before counties required it. But clearly you have more info from watching the news then I do actually seeing it with my own eyes.
"No fluffy, I’m still not seeing a problem that matches the hysteria. I look at the numbers and they make sense. We have to have an end game solution. We can shut everything down again and the numbers go down. The problem is that the boogie man doesn’t go away. In reality, slowing it down may be worse if the immunity wears of as quickly as they suggest.Please look at these numbers and tell me why opening bars is a bad thing. When you see the average mortality age is 77, you tell me how many grannies you see in bars. https://flcovid19.org/"
"""You can't expect to see a measurable drop in infections until masks have been warn by a large percentage of people for a number of weeks. And you haven't reached that point in Florida.""I'm sure your previous visits. to Disney makes you an expert on the current situation down here. All of the large metro areas in Florida have had mask orders in place for weeks. South Florida which has almost half of the infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the state has had mask orders in place for MONTHS. I'm sure the national news you are watching up there in Boston does not bother to mention that, or you lack sufficient comprehension and intelligence to actually hear and understand this. I would suggest sticking to worrying about your own state with the 3rd highest death toll in the country and get a life and stop posting all of this ignorant nonsense on an Orlando travel forum."
"I’ve been to Florida more times than I can count. And have never denied that Mass had issues, but we fixed them and our numbers are much much lower than yours now. But you know better, I guess.And those people going to bars who aren’t grannies? Well, they HAVE grannies and they will expose those grannies to the disease. Along with the workers at the bar and at the grocery stores and everywhere else."
Mask orders are not very useful if they are being widely ignored.
"Northern,Certain posters seem to get great enjoyment out of goading others on here and making statements about masks etc that they know will get reactions. Why, goodness only knows but there's no reasoning with them that's for sure."
"If they had a better reply than ""you don't know what you're talking about"" I'd say there was a chance for reasoning. But I haven't seen a single suggestion of a better way to fight this disease yet."
“Mask orders are not very useful if they are being widely ignored.”And who says they are being ignored? Again those of us that actually see it everyday are telling you that people are complying and have been for WEEKS.
"On “Dangerous to Visit Orlando?”: One contributor from Boston wrote in support of safety and the use of masks, to which a Tampa resident replied: “I would suggest sticking to worrying about your own state with the 3rd highest death toll in the country and get a life and stop posting all of this ignorant nonsense on an Orlando travel forum.”Apart from the tone of the response, I noticed 3 things: a. Historical data: I want to know about Orlando safety now and going forward. What happened elsewhere in the past is not helpful to me and my family, and does not focus on Orlando.  b. Death: Deaths now in Orlando and Florida are important. Florida had 156 record-breaking deaths yesterday. That concerns me. c. Comparison with Massachusetts and other states: I took a look.

"I find it interesting that you can be an expert on all things Florida and not live here. I'm wondering if some of these people have even been here?Let me help little out with a little real information. You cannot compare the northeast in March to Florida now in terms of numbers. There simply was not anywhere near the same level of testing so the numbers will never match. What you can compare was the response and the cries for help that a massive cargo ship was sent and a field hospital was set up. Neither of which were ever used along with the hundreds of thousands of ventilators that were sent. Hospitals were busy, but much like in Florida it is the hospitals that can't turn people away and where the uninsured go because they can't get treatment at a doctors office.What did happen in the northeast is that after a peak of infections, things calmed down. I would imagine that the same will happen in Fla."
"I still don't see any recommendations of how to fix this coming from you, with your boots on the groundIt's easy to read the Tampa Bay Times, etc, for us to know what's going on in Florida.By the way, there were never anything like 'hundreds of thousands of ventilators', and many of the ones that came got to the northeast too late to save lives, that's why our death rate was so high.Things eventually calmed down in the Northeast due to STRICT stay at home orders. Traffic on the roads and public transit in Boston was down 90-95% and similarly in NYC. Everything was closed other than Food stores and Drugstores and gas stations. Everything. Bars. Restaurants. Hotels. Clothing Stores. That's how we got the numbers down. Not by wishing and hoping half measures."
"“Dangerous to Visit Orlando?” -- continuing Post 236In Post 235, our Tampa contributor compared Florida deaths now to historical data for another state earlier: “[G]et a life and stop posting all of this ignorant nonsense on an Orlando travel forum.” Following up on the contributor’s direction to view state comparison on death, I did. Here is what I found concerning trending data since June 1, published today. This is not a repeat of Post 236.Florida ranks:A.

When deaths or positives are reported, they tests or deaths almost certainly DID NOT occur on that day, So while 156 deaths were reported yesterday, we do not know (and will not know for weeks), how many people died of Covid yesterday. The week of July 4-11, over 60% of the deaths reported occurred over 4 weeks earlier. I'm not arguing the accuracy of the numbers, I'm just saying that drawing trends on the numbers is impossible because the data isnt timely.Edited: 12:13 pm, July 17, 2020 "

In Post 240, our Panhandle contributor states (emphasis in the original):“You CANNOT deduce a trend [as] the tests or deaths almost certainly DID NOT occur on that day.*** Drawing trends on the numbers is impossible because the data isn’t timely.”I do not understand why this statement was made to visitors, because:1. Post 236 (and authority) are explicit: “Weekly trend of daily new reported cases per 100,000 residents."" 2. Post 239 (and authority) are explicit: “How the number of deaths per day has changed since June 1.” The data is Posts 236 and 239 are not reports of one day, but track developments over a 7- or 14-day period to provide helpful information. 3. Our Panhandle contributor: “So while 156 deaths were reported yesterday, we do not know (and will not know for weeks), how many people died of Covid yesterday.”If this means there may more than the 156 1-day deaths reported yesterday, visitors will want to know when updated. In the meantime, they will want to know immediately of any further record-breaking 1-day death figures. 4.

Sunngod, If you listen to the national media you would think people are dying in the streets of Orlando. It was nice to get a local news perspective. What I found was people were very happy to see us and are just trying to survive in this tourist town. 22% unemployment in Orlando is a tough number and I feel for them. I also heard on the local news that several testing companies are reporting 100% positive tests. They are not figuring in the negative tests. How does at affect the numbers? Not in a good way."
"we would of paid a deposit by now for a Disney holiday next year if it wasn't for this viruswe normally pay in April or May the year before we goI don't think things will be back to normal next summer and we will wait a couple years before going backwe are also concerned about the USA's high numbers of dead and people infectedpeople I know are not just avoiding Florida, the rest of the USA too, it doesn't mean they're not taking a holiday, just going to different parts of the world. For the price of 1 Disney holiday, we are able to take 2 holidays, 1 to Majorca and the 2nd may be to Cyprus...and this is still £2k cheaper than Disney. Disney is expensive and it's no point going until it is safe and things are running back to how the were before.One of the reasons the USA has been hit so bad is that the clowns running the country are even bigger than the clowns running the UK"
"Billy b the US number of deaths to this horrible thing if far lower than the UKs if you look at the number of deaths per 100 people catching it ours is over 15% v under 4% in the US or we have 50% more deaths per 100,000 of the population. Yes the numbers sound high and they are but compared to the size of the population in both countries we in the U.K. are in a far worse position https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality"
goco11. I’m glad I live in Scotland.
"I think Billy needs to stop getting his news from Facebook and TikTok. I assume when he talks about the clowns, that he is talking about Mother Nature, because she is the only one in control. That same Mother Nature is in control throughout the entire world. You are no safer in Cyprus than in Davenport."
"goco if only it was as simple as that, how about population density UK over 700 U.S. under 100 per square mile this has a Hugh impact on possibility of catching virus, just look at new York or Florida compared to some of the mid states, might be better to compare new york to london to get better comparison. That's without taking into account the differences in reporting, you can't even compare England to Scotland, if you have had the virus and recovered months ago UK records it as covid death but in Scotland it's only if you had it in last 28 days. So it's difficult to say who's in worse position, all you can say is that it would appear the the U.K. has some form of control at the moment where as it does seem to be in the U.S. that it's far from being on a downward trend. But not to worry as trump says he will be right it will go away he just doesn't know when or at what cost but he will be able to say I told you so .....sometime in the future"

"Dangerous to Visit Orlando?” billyb, Bournemouth, Post 253:“We are also concerned about the USA's high numbers of dead and people infected.”billyb: Your summary of “USA numbers” is sobering. [The USA, with 3.5% of the world’s population, is responsible for approximately 25% of the world’s cases and the world’s deaths.]Orlando and Florida, recently:A. Orange County (Orlando area): on Friday, it broke the record on 1-day COVID-19 deaths. B. Florida Statewide: today, Florida first passed 5,000 COVID-19 deaths.C.Florida Statewide over the past week: more than 83,000 new COVID-19 cases. Over the past month: Florida beat its record for new COVID-19 cases—9 times. In addition: a majority of Floridians disapprove of the Governor’s handling of COVID-19; separately, his statements in an effort to reassure tourists about their safety are sometimes at variance with the data and the facts.Taken together, visitors considering an Orlando trip may be asking:“Are we comfortable placing our trust, and our heath, in this situation now?  If not, families as a personal decision may choose to wait until a safe and effective vaccine/medicine is generally available."
"No sungod, I'm talking about the American president and his buffoonsI also don't get my news from facebook or tiktok...lolyes Cyprus and most countries will carry a risk, walking around supermarkets in the UK carries a risk too, just got to wash hands more often, wear face-masks out in crowded areas and follow medical expert advice Disney holidays cost a fortune and the social distancing and restrictions will ruin the holiday, I would rather spend less and go elsewherehopefully Disney will be back to normal in a couple years and we'll go back thenmy wife and I were really looking forward to going next year and it would of been our 1st holiday without our sons, which would of been great!"
"Billy,I hope you can find some place that you feel safe. I can tell you that I feel perfectly safe day in and day out in Florida. You can believe whatever new source you choose, but for me nothing beats a first hand account, and it is by no means bad here. I love when you see posts like Little's that throw out crazy numbers that make it seem bad because they don't put any thought into their numbers. I don't know anywhere else on earth that they are doing the volume of testing like we are doing here. Literally multi-lane drive through testing. Basically like going to McDonalds. Not to mention those places are free. I'm pretty sure nothing like that is going on in Cyprus."
Florida average number of daily tests in July somewhere around 50k population 21.5m. UK average number of test 150k population 66m. These are only rough numbers but population to tests ratio is much the same so I think to suggest there's nowhere on earth doing the same number of tests is a bit rich. People are more concerned about the 10000+ positive results compared to the under 1000 in the U.K.
"“Dangerous to go to Orlando?”Data raising serious safety concerns—was instead treated (Post 261) as a poster who “throw[s] out crazy numbers that make it seem bad because they don't put any thought into their numbers”:1. Four million US COVID-19 cases is not a “crazy number”. Actually, it will be exceeded this afternoon.2. Yesterday, the Bahamas barred tourists from the US. Many had arrived from Florida—nearby and previously the largest market for Bahamian tourism. Bahamians don’t want the infection. They took a stand. The US is #1 in the world in COVID-19 illness and death—while the Bahamas ranks #175.As just two examples: Bahamians respect that 5 million tourists from Canada and the UK had visited Florida annually—some of the tourists who may prefer to vacation in a warm non-US destination virtually COVID-free.To Bahamians, those are not “crazy numbers”—and Bahamians really “put thought in”.3.

Those who do not wish to read from it need not.Reading for meaning: one view of the quotation and link is:1. Governance and policy formation in the State of Florida is dysfunctional; 2. The outcome of this process is the State has become known In the US and worldwide as a leader in the growth of COVID-19-related infection and result;3. The State has failed to provide a coherent written strategic plan for dealing with the matter4. Many tourists don’t trust the Governor’s reassurances concerning their safety. Beyond principle, from the State’s commercial interest: trust, once breached, is difficult to restore. 4. Tourists—on whom Orlando, Florida and their businesses and residents depend— are uncertain, frightened, alienated, astounded and/or bewildered. In any case, the tourists increasingly see the safety of their children, and themselves, through the reality of safe and effective vaccine and medicine—not through calculated spin."

"Simple, if you’re concerned, don’t come. If you’re not concerned, take proper precautions and come. Period. The main reason Florida is in the cross-hairs right now is because it fits a political narrative. Instead of looking at all the data, only one side is being advanced and propogandized because it fits the narrative. Over the past month, we’ve had several friends with families who have visited the state. They abided by local restrictions, took necessary precautions and returned safely and healthy. In all cases, two weeks have elapsed since their visits and they aren’t sick."

"Why do people feel the need to make this all about politics. I have seen some really nasty comments on the forums lately. What happened to the nice people who helped each other with travel info without insulting others? Most of us are grown adults and need to just use common sense. We don't need the governor to order people to do something they already know they should be doing. An order will not make those who won't comply all of a sudden start wearing a mask. Most stores, shops, restaurants, etc have created their own rule for employees and now customers to enter wearing masks. Many will provide you with a mask and hand sanitizer. Yes the virus is out there and its world wide. Florida is not the only place that you could possibly get sick with the virus. As others have said if you are really that worried, stay home. Don't come here but don't go elsewhere either because you could just as easily get it or spread it no matter where you travel."
"I wouldn't consider Orlando any less safe than UK towns and cities, it actually appears that our numbers are worse than America's, when you consider the huge difference in populationwhen we go back to Disney, it'll be when all restrictions and social distancing are back to normal.

"“it actually appears that our numbers are worse than America's, when you consider the huge difference in population”Historic figures may be worse but are totally irrelevant to the present situation. What happened in the past is history, it doesn’t matter what has happened, it’s what is happening now. At this present time ‘our numbers’ are good.We need to look at present day figures and the virus incident rate in Florida is very high and appears out of control. The chances of catching the virus is much great in Florida than in the the UK at present. Our R rate is just OK at about 1, the R rate must be much higher in Florida. Hospital ICUs in Florida are reported to be at maximum capacity, not a place to be ill with C-19. At present we have capacity in ICU in UK, this was what lockdown was all about protecting the NHS and we managed that."
"Born,I think people make it about politics because they need to blame someone and don't like taking responsibility for their own actions. They have the mindset that their safety is the governments responsibility and are under some delusional thought that our elected officials have some power that the rest of us don't."
"The New York Times provides accurate comparative information. At present, the state of Florida (population roughly 20 million) has more deaths per week, latest 743 (Orlando Sentinel) than the UK (nearly 68 million), 480 (NY Times). The problem is that the UK suffered terrible mortality but has gotten it under control. Florida mostly had a fairly mild outbreak, especially around Orlando and Tampa, but it has lately speeded up. It might possibly be peaking now, but it's currently at a high level, much worse than in March and April."
"David. We have a horrifying number of people who have died from Covid 19....around 46,000 ....or over 50,000, depending on which set of stats they use.. Either way it's shocking. Thankfully things are better at the moment."
"sunngod, If you’ve ever actually read the Constitution, the Government is there to “ establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.”  Expecting Government to fulfill its remit is not “blaming someone else.” Holding Government accountable for poor policies, poor decisions or incompetence, is not forgoing personal responsibility. It’s the way a civil society functions and the bedrock of our Republic. Finally, it is not “delusional” to think elected officials have some power the rest of us do not,” because they do. They have the power to make laws, to allocate funding, to command massive resources and a host of other powers outlined in the Constitution and buttressed by legal precedent.A National response to a crisis that is still killing close to 1000 Americans every single day is by its very nature Political. It’s impossible to discuss something like this without debating, encouraging or criticizing the public officials making decisions and leading the response. In my opinion, it’s been a disaster. I would think the same thing regardless of the Political Party in charge. If you think that’s “being political,” so be it.Edited: 8:47 am, July 22, 2020 "

"October,Not really sure I get your point about me not taking responsibility for my actions. I 100% did and by no means attempt to passive aggressively try to project my fears on others. Maybe it scared you that a restaurant went maskless and no one has spontaneously combusted there and you have to keep bringing it up? BTW, went by the same restaurant and they are now masked up because apparently someone snitched so you can rest easy. The manager said that no one has tested positive before or after the masking. Incidentally, I still tipped well."
"As the staff at the restaurant are now masked up, are they classed as Nervous Nellies sunngod? I wonder if you are now having to wear a mask when you go shopping etc? Don't worry, I don't expect a reply!"
"Love, Love, Love the passive aggressive ""don't expect a reply"" statement!!!1. Nope. They are classed as people trying to make a living. 2. If it is required and I have to go into the particular store, yes. If not required, no. I also don't use hand sanitizer, but I do wash my hands with soap. I do floss my teeth on a regular basis.

"""I find humor with the people I see driving around in their car with the windows rolled up tight with their masks on!"" Well, then, you would have been laughing at me today because that's exactly what I did. But it's only because I had the A/C on, and I was driving a short distance and was too lazy to take the mask off. It's kind of a pain to adjust, so it's just easier to leave it on sometimes. :)"
"Sunngod, “somebody snitched”. This has all been a game to you for months, you have had more attention than ever and are wallowing in the misery of others. If Orlando/Florida has only stuck lockdown out for a bit longer to suppress the virus and then took a sensible approach to masks and physical distancing then economic normality would be a lot further down the road, instead, commerce was put before health. Even the buffoon in DC has now realised that and is trying to show some gravitas. Person, women , man, camera TV. All he had to remember was, coronavirus kills people but got caught up playing to the gallery."
"sunngod.Oh I see. It's only people that don't work and wear masks who are ""Nervous Nellies"" in your eyes. As for your second point (made without thinking about it), if people are out shopping (like I was last week) and had two or three stores to go into within a short space of time, well, that is why they had their masks on it their cars (like I did) because there was no way I wanted to waste three masks for three different shops.

Destination is not rude or belligerent and is entitled to offer advice without being called out every time. People can choose to open links posted in this forum, or not open the links. From that point, they are able to make their own decision on where to book, who to book with, etc. I agree, it may have been good to know upfront that he/she was affiliated with a travel company, but it’s up to each person to decide what information they take from any of these posts. No one is forcing anyone to book with any particular company. I haven’t seen a post from Destination posting a link in a long while."

"Mike & Sungod, are you referring to PartyPA? Was that their name? They often directed people to one site in particular."
"You haven’t seen a link from her to that particular travel agency because 1/ Disney parks were closed and covid continues to make travel more complicated and 2/the self-promotion violates TA posting guidelines (something that has been repeatedly addressed) so she has had to get more creative (new user name, using PM, burying the link amongst other links etc). It does not change the fact that she uses this forum exclusively for self-promotion. Take a first time (or infrequent) traveler to WDW - that’s who she focuses on in her replies - and post after post, if you check her other user name’s posting history, has her agency’s website. Had she disclosed beforehand that she is a Disney travel agent working for such and such then yes, the poster would then have all the info they need to make an informed decision but that is not the case here. It’s incredibly underhanded, most infrequent visitors have no idea that this is happening and are under the impression that this is just an advice from a fellow traveler, and other posters certainly have a right to call her out on this!"
"I agree, if and when he/she posts a link to that agency, by all means, call them out on it, but it’s gotten to the point that they cannot offer any advice at all, in any form, without the next several posts having something negative to say about it.This is just my opinion, and the fact that there is so much negativity on this forum lately, is really bothersome."
Yes Mark that’s the one..

Rene Plasencia (Orange County)]. However, the most alarming part is not just “the virus is spreading uncontrolled in Florida.” Using 64 interviews, the article looks inside the ""collapse"" of state health care policymaking and structure. The result: family safety concerns, expressed here and repeatedly elsewhere, are not implemented. Worse, the article gives specifics on how few if any in the state government are left, are qualified, or are interested in a reliable process to hear and act.  A nurse, a life-long Republican, notes: “The fairy tales about all being under control are nonsense. Our government has failed us.” Bottom line: after reading the article many parents may or may not want, as a personal individualized decision, to involve their families in the situation.__Re: Post 342. “I join those who do not disrespect, slur or malign others.”Edited: 12:37 pm, July 27, 2020 "

"Also, I assume Sunngod has been somewhat familiar with the area for a number of years.

They were a southern rock band called Stranger, and their recording company screwed them over, but every time I saw they were playing at the old FBI in Winter Park, I was there.

As always, there are complainers, mostly about masks, about how things are operating differently, or some facilities (pool, spa) or restaurants that aren't open. It's clear that if you can get there and are willing to go with the flow, it can be a great time. She said one family told her yesterday that they were able to ride ROTR twice in a day!

"Glad our resident expert has shared more info with the belief that because it is on the internet, it has to be true! Oh wait, except when you take those points and put them into context, they really don't support the fear.1. You can find hundreds of different studies on anything. This link is pretty much irrelevant. 2. Yeah, the more you test, the more you find. People are wearing masks and the numbers keep going up. Good I say. The faster people get it, the faster it goes away.257 deaths? You don't say? Sounds terrifying except people die every day. Florida has a large senior population and guess what? We don't live forever and tagging 257 deaths to Covid doesn't mean that is what caused the death. Hospitals get paid for treating covid patients and classifying them as such get them paid. 7400? ok so again, people die. Sad but true, but when you take into account this fact and look at the statistics on where these numbers are coming from, it isn't shocking. This site shows a pretty graph that our out of state expert should analyze - https://flcovid19.org/ Take a look at the age distribution and pay close attention to Age Distribution (cases, total) and Age Distribution (fatalities, total) graphs. Two things that stand out are children under 18 in both and the mirror effect of those that have it and those that have died that tested positive. Again, testing positive doesn't equal cause of death. Then the genius should look at the Case average age and Fatality age. They are very, very far apart. Average fatality age is 77 considering the average life expectancy in Florida is 78, we are not really out of line here. Here is another fact that Little needs to digest - Although not individually reportable, pneumonia and influenza deaths in people of all ages are monitored through review of deathcertificate data. Estimating the number of deaths due to influenza is challenging because:• Influenza is not frequently listed on the death certificates of people who die from influenza-related complications.• Many influenza-related deaths occur one to two weeks after a person’s initial infection, often due to development of secondarybacterial infection (e.g., pneumonia) or because infection aggravated an existing chronic illness (e.g., congestive heart failure,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).• Most people who die from influenza are never tested."

"I'll probably make an effort to visit Disney and Universal while they aren't busy. Both are shutting down attractions and Disney is ""slashing"" hours for fall (Orlando Sentinel), so doing the visits may be somewhat complex. I may avoid some rides to avoid crowds/indoor situations. But I still haven't seen Hogwarts or Pandora, and I at least want to see the latter's creative landscaping with lots of palms, especially fishtail palms (Caryota), over 200 of them. Recent visits to Orlando airport (late July) were with it not busy. The project to create passenger train service from the airport to West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami may have hit a snag. Virgin has withdrawn from the program, so its name is back to Brightline. The new tracks are under construction from Cocoa to the airport along state road 528 (Beachline) and at the airport itself. Work on the huge new Terminal C continues, though the number of new gates to be opened initially has been cut, and a train station which was to have served the local commuter rail will instead only have the line to Miami (and possibly Disney--plans for a Disney station are supposedly still going ahead). Florida's covid-19 epidemic may be slowing down a bit, but the rate of new infections is still very high and the daily death toll (which lags weeks behind the reported infections) may or may not yet have peaked. The death toll has been low, so I don't expect that Orlando is contributing much to the nation's substantial number of excess deaths due to covid-19. But still, if I were living in a part of the country (like Pennsylvania northward), with a low infection rate, would I want to visit? Seems a bad idea.

"I figure it will be many moths before Florida is what you would call normal. Kids are supposed to be back at school but many parents are just too worried for in person teaching. All four of our grandchildren that live just 45 mins drive from Disney have been enrolled in on line school for the next year. Many parents have done the same so that is a huge ""not normal"" thing going on. There is not much more that Disney can do at present to encourage visitors so they will have to ride out the storm and hope by middle of next year the worst is over and they can reintroduce all the things they have cancelled."

Tourists will decide whether the safety response is “reassuring”, and whether virus issues are “over exaggerated”. Each decision impacts Orlando hotel managers and investors, theme parks, local businesses, employment and the state and local tax base for public services."

"It's prudent of the rest of the world to forbid travel to the US while the epidemic continues without serious control.While there are some restrictions on travel within the US, it would be helpful to increase those restrictions, mainly to protect the mostly northeastern states that have low rates of infection.

"https:/…This link shows the virus cases are coming down, deaths are down. It will continue to reduce."
"I've been watching the New York Times (and Johns Hopkins and official Florida) figures. While the virus cases are down, Florida deaths appear to be still rising. That's because deaths lag behind hospitalizations, which have doubled since June. For Orange County (1.3 million people), 297 deaths so far is not at all catastrophic, but the vast increase in infected people since the start of June is a genuine calamity. At present, it'll take almost nothing for infections to proliferate again. We still have a Governor whose first priority is to remain in Trump's good graces (there is reason for that: Trump is vindictive and punishes states whose governors he doesn't like. Do you want to have a hurricane with no federal assistance?), great uncertainty about what will happen with reopening of schools and the state universities and colleges, and the possibility of big spreader events if there's big hurricane evacuations.

"Disney and Universal are offering very attractive ticket (and for Disney, reservation) deals to Florida residents."
Disney always does deals for Florida residents. That isn’t new or unique to the current situation.
"True, but for a time, Disney seemed uncertain about what to do with locals. It seems a unique opportunity to get caught up on the theme parks. I've always hated standing in line."
"Universal is offering Florida residents a buy one day get the rest of 2020 free, on sale for a limited time. That’s a pretty unique deal."
"It is! Of course we don't know what will happen with the Pandemic with school opening (or perhaps not). I'm involved in planning a small botanical garden's holiday light show, and we don't know whether it'll be feasible."
I guess it depends on how many people and how big the place is. The Rock City place up the road from you is huge. I bet you could get a few people in there.
"The universal deal is similar to what SeaWorld has been offering for years, It sure is tempting since there are no blackout dates."
I am amazed at the many positive replies to my post of July 3rd.The numbers and indications coming out of WDW and Universal would indicate they are seeing less attendance the they were hoping for.Really think that in spite of the daily hype vaccines we are looking at 6-9 months before an effective vaccine is available to the average person so you can TRAVEL WITH A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF SAFETY.Stay safe every one.
"Our cases are going up so quickly because people from New York and all the states that have a LOT of cases, are coming down here and some are not wearing masks."
"At present, it is Florida and other southern states that have the large numbers of cases. The New York City area has far fewer, so the current concern is of people going from the Southeast to the Northeast, not the reverse. The New York Times ""Hot Spots"" map is probably the best available snapshot. https:/…coronavirus-us-cases.htmlFlorida did not have a wave of cases and deaths in March and April, but thanks to prematurely reopening had lots of cases in June. That wave peaked, and our case counts are now down about 40% from the peak. So Florida is now reporting 126 cases per 100,000 population per week, while New York state is reporting 22 per 100,000 per week. Florida has minimal public health services and around 13% of the population has no health insurance. That causes problems. Fortunately, the major retailers seem to have been successful in getting their customers to wear masks nearly all the time. It's probably done a lot of good."
"On safety: A Florida judge ruled Monday the state's requirement--that all brick-and-mortar public schools must offer in-class education by August 31--""arbitrarily prioritized reopening schools statewide in August over safety, and over the advice of health experts and that all districts complied in order to avoid loss of state funding.""https:/…index.htmlIn addition to the health of the children, the decision also bears on transmission by children to teachers, family members and others in groups.Edited: 6:23 am, August 25, 2020 "
"As someone who used to travel across the pond every year to visit Orlando, my opinion is that it will probably be 2022 before any sort of normality returns. I just hope that airlines, restaurants and attractions can manège to survive for the sort of length of time. Also, of course travellers."
"You are bonkers, Victoria. Look at the CURRENT numbers to see where the folks with the virus are located.Florida has looked a bit better the past few days, hopefully this is the start of a great trend!"
"The only thing not ""normal"" for a tourist currently is the lack of bars, a face covering requirement, and some capacity limitations.Locals have to deal with a high unemployment rate and the decisions on which of the options to use for their kid's school. As far as doing things, it has been very normal on the weekends for me as several of the places that I like are now open."
I wonder why our expert from Montrose Rd hasn't posted how the numbers have continued to drop in fla?
Montrose Road ?

I presumed LBO Fluffy..
Montrose Rd is a Rockville thing.
A bellwether is perhaps that Qantas is not planning to resume flights between Australia and the US until 2022. Effective vaccines and theraputics could shorten the wait.
"Family safety update: Medical authority is united--testing is smart for someone exposed to another with COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis. Nevertheless, the President has repeatedly said he does not like more testing because it shows (does not cause) more cases. And this week, without medical support, the US government issued a “guidance”--that those without symptoms “do not necessarily need testing”. August 28, 2020: https:/…testing-overview.html The scientific community was stunned : fewer tests of asymptomatic patients (who transmit 40% or more of all cases) means increased risk, extensive confusion, and further difficulty in pandemic control long term. The Government ""Guidance"" may also substantially decrease or deny testing reimbursement. Fewer tests lower “test” counts--but do not inform the public about illness or death, which may then increase without adequate testing. Safety-oriented families may wish to consider: 1. Whether any “safety trend” report uses data, as here, that is not a valid measurement of illness or is skewed downward from actual pandemic conditions; 2. For clarity, whether the change in method and data is reported to you at the same time as any “safety trend” involving tests; 3. Including both deaths (Florida #5) and cases (Florida #3) with “trend” and other information in assessing family safety;4. Whether it is now simpler, less confusing, more reassuring, and perhaps safer to wait for a scientifically-proven, safe and effective vaccine or medicine before your trip. ______________________Re: Post 342. “I join those who do not disrespect, slur or malign others.""Edited: 4:26 pm, August 28, 2020 "
How has this thread not died yet. I see the obnoxious posting of random links continues. Wonder what he’s going to have to spam once this blows over.

"Post 431: ""I see the obnoxious posting of random links continues.""An alternative view is:1. The thread, started by another contributor and a major public service, is ""Dangerous to Go to Orlando? Does everyone understand that?"" Posts concerning family safety when visiting Orlando are responsive to this thread.. 2. Family safety is a priority community value. The thread, with 430 posts, contains strong, continuing community response on an ongoing basis to that community value across a range of perspectives. 3. For many parents safety is not ""obnoxious"", but valued. Instead, for them, opposition to the availability of safety information is disfavored. All parents are free to consult, give weight or ignore safety information available to them. 4. Safety is not ""random"", but has a number of components which arise from time to time. For example: A. Earlier this week, US government statements about plasma as “a very historic breakthrough”, promising it “will save thousands and thousands of lives” were exaggerated and retracted. For parents, that may be important to consider in their planning. nytimes.com/2020/…blood-plasma-fda.html B. Also this week, mandatory in-class schooling of children raises the safety issue of transmission from children to teachers, family members and others in gatherings. C. Just yesterday, the world-renowned IHME Model, used by the White House, provided its latest prediction. Based on current US mask use, that prediction is US deaths (US now 180,000, Florida now 11,000) will exceed 200,000 within 3 weeks and will exceed 315,000 by December. https:/…index.html5. Orlando tourism business is strengthened by public confidence in safety. Knowledgeable contributors are encouraged to respond with fact and options to safety concerns raised. If state policy is viewed by some as operating in a different direction, knowledgeable comments on the merits for modification or revision reflect thought and serve Orlando tourism business.Edited: 11:04 pm, August 28, 2020 "
