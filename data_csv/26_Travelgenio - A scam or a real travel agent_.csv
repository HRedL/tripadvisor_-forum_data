"I booked tickets from Israel to India through Travelgenio. Given the CoronaVirus outbreak I want to cancel my ticket. I called Air India, they said that they can’t cancel or schedule and that the agent has to contact them. But Travelgenio is not reachable. You cannot call them and they don’t respond to emails. What to do!"

"Giving us a generic response to your terms and conditions is not helpful. This has been a good lesson to travellers across the world. We bought tickets from you as they were cheaper. This was a huge mistake! If we had booked through the airline, we would have gotten our money back. You are indeed a scam. https:/…www.travelgenio.comRead the reviews there. You do not. contact people even if their flight is leaving within 72 hours and/or refund does not come through even if you say it is processed."

As per my best knowledge Air India providing full refund only for mist affected regions like italy china Japan iranFor other regions they are offering rescheduling without any add charges but with fare difference to be paid
Im sure you are hurting and not happy going by your post but the question you are asking are they a scam. In.the last 3 years i have booked numerous flights with them and only had 1 problem. That problem was actually my own fault making a mistake on my booking. I contacted these guys through messenger and they could not have been any more helpfull. Like everyother company they will be innundated with messages. Good luck anyway.
"If you paid for the trip through a credit card, consider contacting your credit card company to ask for advice."
"hi,Did you receive any response from travelgenio?? I am trying to contact them from one month, my flight was on april 4th and i still didn't receive any reply."
