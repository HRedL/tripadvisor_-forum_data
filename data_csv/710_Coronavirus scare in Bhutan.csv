"Hi,I’m planning a trip to Bhutan in first week of March from Delhi. Is it safe to travel to Bhutan amidst Coronavirus scare around the world? Any comment would be appreciated."
"Hello,Things are developing and nobody can know what will happen in two weeks. Just listen to the news and the advise of your government, then decide. Plan on last minute cancellation of hotels and other services booked and ask your travel insurance about their rules in this situation. Good luck, and please, if there are any advises about travelling to Bhutan, post them here for others,"
"Just returned from a 7 day trip to Bhutan on 20th Feb., I think you dont need to worry about the corona-virus situation in Bhutan as long as you do not get a fever (or have recently been to China).On entry at Phoentsholing (or Paro airport) you would be scanned for temperature before your passport is stamped for entry.Officials (even local policemen) will advise you to keep your masks on as precautionary measure.Dont worry, enjoy your trip but be safe... carry and wear masks.. particularly in flights and at airport"
"As per the declaration of WHO the novel corona virus outbreak as a global health emergency. The executive director of Association of Bhutanese Tour Operator, Sonam Dorji said that they have requested TCB to facilitate to refund the visa or to postpone their trip. According to Tourism Council of Bhutan those tourists are from China, Singapore and Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Australia were supposed to visit in February, March and April. Thorough screening at the airport Bhutan has responded swiftly and very careful and vigilant.Edited: 8:09 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Sir/Madam,Any recent Updates on this Corona Virus ??!!"
Hi !!Is it safe to travel Bhutan from March 17th to March 23rd?? or should we postpone the trip.
"I cancelled my trip, i didn’t want to take any risk. So, it’s your call."
Me too cancelled my trip to Bhutan. Y simply risk life
You're probably in more danger from a car accident than getting Coronavirus in Bhutan. And you do realise that if you're an otherwise healthy person getting coronavirus is not like getting rabies (which DOES exist in Bhutan).The panic over this virus is ludicrous.
"I am at Thimpu now.reached yesterday i.e 02nd March 2020 and going to be in Bhutan till Saturday. I am taking necessary precautions and doing well with my trip. Nothing to worry about Corona in Bhutan they are very much careful about screening and they have full hygenic environment which itself a good sign. we are using Masks,Sanitisers etc as a precautionary measure"
"Hello dear, thx for ur post, we too are planned for a family trip to Bhutan in 1st week of May, should I continue my plans, as u r in Bhutan now, I think u will be the correct person to know the ground realities there, and how long does it take to test for cornavirus on the airport or at road entry points to Bhutan."
All tourists are banned from entering Bhutan till 20 March. I suggest you wait till then and decide if you want to visit Bhutan in May.
"On confirmation of Covid-19 with American tourist on 6th March 2020,entry into Bhutan has been stopped for two weeks initially and this may get extended if the virus get spreaded to the people (wife,driver,guide,hotel staff and others who had close contact with the tourist as per his itinerary...total 34members I think) who are quarantined for 14days,which is incubation period of Covid-19. If all the cases are negative , they may lift out the ban on entry into Bhutan and you can proceed with your plan. While entering Bhutan they shall check your body temperature,if it is high ,they shall quarantine till you come out as negative else your entry shall be done as usual."
"Also the American tourist has entered Bhutan from Guwahati airport after travelling in North East for 8-10days and his entry at Paro was done as usual as Covid-19 will show it's symptoms after 14 days and we really don't know how many have covid-19 those who had close contact with him in North East.Chances of covid-19 are high to Elder People and Children who have less immunity power. During our trip,we had used masks everywhere.only during photography and having food,we removed them. Used sanitizer for every 20-25mins and if we have to touch menu cards,exchange of cash in hotels,While visiting places etc. No conversation with foreigners,avoided Groups Completely etc etc"
