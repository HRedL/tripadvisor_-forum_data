Got flights on the 28th and Ryanair won't cancel our refund so going to go
You will not be able too enter the Country I'd look too change your dates as it stands absolutely no point in flying there.
"No. With case numbers going up in multiple neighboring countries, some restrictions might even be reintroduced."
"https://www.bud.hu/en/covid_19/information_o…It clearly says on the Airport BUD web site Brits are NOT allowed too enter the country with out permission as I've said absolutely no point in flyingLike EZY BA & WIizz can all change dates I'm sure R.Air will do the sameEdited: 10:43 am, July 09, 2020 "
"The rules may change between now and the 28th......and they may not.I have a residence permit and I can enter the country* - as of last weekend I no longer need the permission of the police to do so: but before that I needed the permission of the police. The change happened without warning.* but I must isolate for 2 weeks when I get here, unless on arrival I can provide a certificate that I am virus-free.Edited: 11:28 am, July 09, 2020 "
The FCO advice is NOT too travel you can claim on your CC
"It is frustrating that the whole of the UK is restricted, where I am in Norfolk the infection rate is 0.09 per million. We have only had 2800 cases and it is all but irradiated here. I miss going to Budapest, we go twice a year and didn't get to go in April. Was hoping to spend Summer there, still got my fingers crossed that it can still happen but am not going ahead to book anything until Hungary open the borders. Oh well there is always Christmas in Budapest!"
"The only update is that due to sudden (but well expected cause of those ""early re-openings"") and significant rise of infections in all the neighboring countries, the government as of today, has started to plan new RESTRICTIONS! Yes, yes restrictions it is. It was said that most of the infections around us has been ""imported"" by foreigners (behurcolt esetek, meaning ""dragged in"" cases) so we have to stop this ASAP.So much about re-openings. I think we can slowly, but definitely forget any leisure travels this summer/fall:((Oh, and then they say the second wave is very much expected by November......."
"Prepare for next years too.Governments get more and more appetite to ""save"" us from this particular virus with unhealthy zealousness.Edited: 4:14 am, July 11, 2020 "
"Is everything including borders going to close every time there is an outbreak just so that no one will die because of covid? According to the WHO we may never get rid of this virus ever, so I really wonder if this lockdown process will go on repeat every time. I am now even more confident Sweden did the right thing, to just let it pass and not delay it into future.Edited: 10:35 am, July 11, 2020 "
I am sure that those who have lost relatives in Sweden concur wholeheartedly with your opinion. I will have the chance to find out next week.It appears to me that governments are banking on a vaccine being available within the next 9 months.
"My mother R.I.P. in AD2019. Not from corona. Do you think, that those loosing their relatives infected with corona virus are in some other, very special grief situation? Corona viruses are ever present. And so far responsible scientists say that stable vaccine against them isn't possible because they mutate all the time.Edited: 4:53 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"No Politics? Ha? :))))Tomorrow, at 11 am sharp (July 12th) dear government will have to announce new measures concerning the new possible restrictions (again) due to those rapidly rising infections in neighboring countries. So let's wait and see!"

"""Do you think, that those loosing their relatives infected with corona virus are in some other, very special grief situation?""When comparing the death rate from Covid-19 in countries like Hungary to that in places like the UK or Sweden, then yes, those relatives are fully entitled to feel especially aggrieved."
The UK has just dropped down too 8th place we have around 44k or 45k deaths in England Wales Scotland N.I with a population of over 70 million that's around 0.006% of UK population The UK is much much much BIGGER than Hungrey I just googled population it said 9.7 million someone please correct me if wrong so obviously the UK is going too be worse off 70 million v 9.7 million
"I was in the same position a couple of weeks ago and ended up paying to cancel the flights, at least that way we held onto about two thirds of the credits. Our insurance excess was more than the cancellation fee which I've learned a lesson from.I'm going to rebook for next year but pay extra for flex fares - prices have dropped quite a lot since we booked back in January."
"Roman citizen, grief from every death is the same and depends only on emotional state of concrete people. Many times people are critical of doctors for outcome on their job. But there absolutely isn't difference between deaths caused of this VIP (for someone's subjective understanding) virus and other causes of death. No elderly will live forever in this disabled body.Edited: 5:26 am, July 12, 2020 "

"So now, people from Sweden can't come either, even though new infections here are rapidly declining. But it was fine last month to come to Hungary when our infection rate was alot higher. This is the third time this summer I had to cancel a flight cause a foreign country closed their borders to our country. Money down the drain, all based on false promises. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…"
"Mange_H Traveler ,fully understand your concerns. It's like playing worldwide game ""Pandemic"" and inventing new rules with element of artificiality in the time of playing.

"Hi cheers for thatRyanair holding up to ransom unfortunately, won't refund but we can't fly work that out"
Ryanair unfortunately
"Fortuently I booked with WizzAir with Flex addition, so I got a credits refund. However it has to be spent within 90 days, so I will have to take part in this Pandemic game yet another time and place a bet on another country. Will they be open, or will they not."
"""Money down the drain, all based on false promises.""The Hungarian government has at no time made ANY promises that the situation was not fluid and liable to change at any moment. Just like every other government. We are living in extraordinary times: live with it."
"Taffy, I am intrigued by your logic. Accurate figures for the UK population are hard to come by, but a consensus is around 67 million. Hungary's is indeed around 9.7. So the UK's population is around 7 times greater than that of Hungary (please note spelling).UK deaths from COVID-19 are 44,798: Hungarian deaths are 595, so the UK has 75 times more deaths than Hungary.7 times the population, 75 times the number of deaths.Surely a discrepancy of 10x cannot be just because the UK is bigger than Hungary ?Edited: 2:30 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"""We are living in extraordinary times""--------------------I guess that we live in times of worldwide conspiracy against freedom of people and Constitutions of states, times of illogical decisions and absurd rules. Never before have seen such overzealous care or more honestly, lip service, for young and elderly people with oncology or every other serious and deadly disease.This rises suspicion together with classical question - it's stupidity or crime?Edited: 2:56 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"""The Hungarian government has at no time made ANY promises""Well it felt like that for me. First they say, border is open for all of the EU, you can go, please come visit. Then I book. And then just ""Ha! Now you can't go again!"" Even though recent infection rate here is actually now much lower than the time when they opened the border, though admittedly higher than Hungary. So it was okay when it was worse, but not now."
"It is not great in the UK, but it does seem that the virus has spread more in Countries that have a greater population density. As I have said before the area of the UK I am from the infection rate is 0.09 per million. Cities such as London, the rate is 27.3 per million, a huge difference. Not only do you have a smaller population but your residents are more spread out over a larger area. This prevalence of this virus seems to be where densely populated areas did not act quickly enough to maximise social distancing."
"Hi,brief explanation of the new regulations valid from midnight July 14:3 Categories of countries: Green, Yellow, Red.RED = NO Entry into Hungary.GREEN: Everybody welcome (even from Croatia where the infection rate started to grow rapidly!!!)Now the MOST complicated the YELLOW (definitely not the submarine):Hungarian citizens only 14 day home isolation and a chance of being free after 5 days if they provide a negative PCR test.FOREIGNERS have to go to a house quarantine in any case! But there is one and only exception if they can provide 2 tests made within 5 days before their entry into Hungary. Those 2 tests have to be done in a time frame of 48 hours. So, one test, than another test 48 hours later and all this within 5 days. I know, I know, all this sounds a bit complicated but it seemed even the government was not VERY sure of what their new regulations were about:))) If the foreign person(s) doesn't have a place for home quarantine, then he has to proceed to a place ""strongly recommended"" by the authorities.YELLOW countries:Bulgaria, UK, Norway, Russia (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10 times more infections than in Ukraine which is in the Red list), Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Japan, China, US (!!! No comments!) I think they forgot to include India and Brazil in that category!!!RED Countries:Albania, Bosnia, Belorussia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Ukrainealong with ALL the Asian, African, South American countries, Australia, Oceania.All the RED and YELLOW countrie's citizens if necessary will get the test for FREE till July 31. From August 1st its on you!Of course there are some exceptions and one is the most debilitattingly idiotic, saying that all the sportsmen coming for competitions held in Hungary, can freely enter withstanding what country they are from!!!Of course these rules are not the Ten Commandments. Dear government will revise them every single week, or in an urgent case immediately will implement the necessary changes.Edited: 6:39 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"Thanks Béla, that's exactly my understanding of what I read in Hungarian press yesterday.I a bit surprised that USA gets into the yellow category, while there is a blanket ban on South America nations. Fair too that UK and Sweden fall into the yellow category, maybe some other European countries will be joining soon. What I'm puzzled about is how two weeks quarantine is enforced. Even many returning citizens would struggle to stay locked up at home without being able to go food shopping.In Australia quarantine is now enforced by having to stay in quarantine hotels regardless of test status at a cost of 3000 AUD for a single person, reducing if more people share same quarantine room. Also flights are being limited to capacity of quarantine facilities.As a final observation, drivers and all team staff for next week's Hungarian GP are going to be quarantined within their hotels and confines of the Hungaroring. Absolutely no going out for walks, or to bars or restaurants."
"The two week quarantine has been in place for months. No leaving even for food. Authorities will check up on you and neighbors will be aware due to a red sticker on your door (we all know how nosey neighbors can be). One our neighboring Airbnb flats hosted a quarantined individual so that also works.Wolt and netpincer have protocols for leaving food at the door.for those quarantined.Here.is an article.in English.

"""Not only do you have a smaller population but your residents are more spread out over a larger area.

More or less from day one Hungary blocked her borders, while the UK continued to allow thousands of people to flock into the country, without the need to quarantine: lunacy."
London has a population of around 9 million & Budapest has 1.7 million how can Budapest be more crowded there about 7 million more people in London you can fit Budapest in London 4 or 5 times over
"Hi Chris.No conflicts at all. Your article is just an English speaking Hungarian source and mine was the interpretation of the official government announcement. I haven't mentioned the transit through Hungary, cause nowadays it is absolutely non essential for this forum.As of today we already have some corrections;Hungarians coming from yellow countries now also require 2 tests and not a single one. For instance like all the Hungarians coming back from Greece via Serbia. I can definitely foresee people jumping into Croatia (and believe me, I know it from multiple personal experiences, the Croatian border police will care a monkey for Hungarians simply transiting through Croatia) and thus entering Hungary from a Green country! We are very ""smart"" people, you know:)New revisions will be taken on Wednesday, so by the time the new rules will come to power they will be probably changed for good. Nothing is granted now:)By the way some countries, like Croatia, so eager for the tourist cash, that they (as of today's announcement) let in not only business people or residents, but also ordinary American tourists to enter the country. You just got to have a serious explanation/reason for that. Something like a Hotel reservation will do!!! So much about severe regulations, quarantines and other crap:))"
"Taffy, quit trying to justify the UKs poor performance. Let's look at the death rate...something that can't be hidden by low testing. The UK is the worst as it relates to current hot spots...far exceeding the runner up, yours truly, the US. Face it, even though the media loves to blast the US as the worst handled country, you guys are even worse than us. Hungary has handled the situation quite well...only around 600 deaths and a good high percentage of those were nursing homes (not to say nursing home deaths don't matter, but once they hit, there's really nothing you can do to stop them). In fact, most of the European countries doing better than Hungary are neighboring countries, which are starting to have their own flare ups...but Hungary still remains calm.

"Kat, do you believe Brazil is at all honest about reporting Covid-19 deaths, not just Bolsanaro and his politics, but the general incapability of most of South America to have enough testing and data gathering in place to confirm deaths as coronavirus. Same goes for much of Asia and Africa. Believe Brazil are still recording large proportion of deaths as bronchial pneumonia !UK seems to have the virus under control, averaging under 100 deaths per day and 600 positive tests, with a testing regimen similar to the US in terms proportion of population tested. Just one city in lock down. Compare this to USA, Florida 15,000 new cases yesterday, California 7,000, Texas 6,000, Georgia 3,000. Death pattern follows in 3-4 weeks, although many people infected now are young.

I was a bit of a photographer in those days, had a pit pass to formulae up to F2. Lucky enough to record Ayrton Senna's rise through FF1600, FF2000, and F3 on hundreds of negatives.

"People say they know f1....Well you know people book months and months in advance. We are huge fans in our house and been to a few if the tracks including singapore and abu Dhabi....husband drove a supercar on the latter. What they are doing with the f1 is a complete shambles. You have some teams who have worked together in close quarters for months being split up with some being allowed trackside and not. Thing is they have been working together for months and years so if one member if the team has it it's likely spke of the others have it. Therefore allowing some into the track and not others is a bit pointless. They should have halted it altogether. You say leave politics out of it but there is no doubt this is playing a massive part in what we are seeing. We are seeing spikes in many countries in europe including spain (Catalonia etc) but it seems those countries arent effected! It's a sad state of affairs to be honest. The death rate isnt the issue.

"Hi Mark, The travel advice for entering Hungary from the UK changes tomorrow, they have a traffic light system of which the UK is an Amber warning. Right now the only way of getting into the country without quarantine is if you are a resident of Hungary or if you have tested negative for Covid-19 twice within the 5 days prior to arrival (Tests have to be 48 hours apart) If i were you i would set up a update on the gov.uk website for Hungary travel advice so as when there is a change you know immediately. I am due to go to Budapest in September & heres hoping everything will be ok by then.Best of luckScott"
Cheers ScottFingers crossed it goes green ✅

"Hopefully you are right vmark! We are here end of August. Its nonsensical to allow, for example spanish folks, to walk right on in with no quarantine yet insist on 2 tests from the brits done within 48 hours of each other and no more than 5 days before entry when barcelona has just forced hundreds of thousands back into lockdown and Catalonia is suffering again. There are other examples of other countries like this too in europe. You cant just demand the tests on the nhs they coat alot of money! It has to be political to some extent because it doenst make sense otherwise!Edited: 12:27 pm, July 17, 2020 "
Hi - I have a UK passport but will be arriving in to Budapest from Greece (green) - Is it my nationality or the origin of the flight that will be considered? TIA
"Think they will need proof of your travel history and main residence.A very grey area. More concern is if you arrive from a yellow or red country, but show a passport of a green country.Think that the rules are to control mass tourism from countries, not the odd person who doesn't conform with nationality vs country of residence."
It should be based on the country where you reside and have travelled from and not your passport. You could have been residing in a 'green' country for the last 10 years but still have a passport from a red or amber country as you aren't a citizen in the country you are residing.
"Crazy, ambiguous ... how does this work at Liszt Ferenc passport control ?Flown in from Heathrow, Hungarian passport, go through. Flown in from Heathrow, Irish passport, go through.

"You're right Laura, it seems ridiculously crazy logic.Can I fly with my UK passport from London to Dublin and then go to Budapest and say that I live in Dublin. Do I avoid quarantine that way?"
"But dont you have to give an.address where you reside and if it was the uk wouldnt that be identified when entering the country? Dont you need to complete a form like you do when you go into spain?

Klm are also flying. You can fly to schipol then onto budapest. The reason people are confused and frustrated is because they feel some countries are being treated differently to others even if those countries have spikes and rising cases. It doesnt seem quite fair does it!
I’m due to fly in the middle of August from Scotland with Ryanair. Hope the rules are changed by then. The virus is highly suppressed here and it seems unfair. I noticed an article in Hungary Today that says that the rules are to be refined so that countries or counties with low virus reproduction rates would be allowed entry even if within a red country zone.
does anybody know how often they re-access & update there countries & entry policy?
Supposed to be once a week on a Wednesday but I can’t find any update anywhere.
Tried to change our flights with Ryanair for September. Costs just about as much as the flights. Just have to hope they cancel.
"Yeah, I’m the same boat (or plane)! Really unfair when Ryanair are promoting free flight changes for new bookings!"
"I wouldn’t count on Ryanair cancelling flights,we were meant to be there early July and even though at the time British foreign office were saying not to fly,and Hungary were not allowing uk residents in Ryanair were still flying ,we had booked with last minute and were told as flights going we could not change our holiday or get a refund .lesson learnt will do all my own booking from now on.loved Budapest was there last year and hopefully will be back there next year ."
"RAir are getting loads of bad press for doing that lately getting planes off the ground just so they don't have too cancel & refund anyone I had a refund from EZY in 28 days even got an Email nx day letting me know & too say sorry it's taken over 14 days cant fault them there I'd never book anything with RAir all the best for nx time.& Always book your Flight & Hotel separately a lot of people getting stungEdited: 7:39 am, July 26, 2020 "
Lesson to be learnt .Booked flights last year. Luckily hotel booked separately and we can cancel no problem. I will never fly with Ryanair again. Why would they fly you to a country you can't stay or have to isolate when you arrive!!
"No change on UK entry rules, last update was Friday 17th July.Still showing as an Amber nation with a 14 day Quarantine mandatory unless two Covid-19 negative tests taken 24hrs apart & within 5 days of entry are handed to officials at point of entry.I'm personally hoping that they break up the UK & take quarantine measures on a single nation by nation approach instead of lumping us all together as some parts of the country are doing better than others."
"I think all countries should break the US up too. My state is one of the few doing well. And within the state my city is doing better than the rest of the state, so they should break it up by city even!!!!Seriously folks...you are already complaining that the process is confusing as it relates to transit...how crazy would it be to try to track what region you're from?"
"I keep checking every Wednesday to see if the Amber status has been revised. Seems very strange that many other countries are on green per have a much higher infection rate per 100,000 people."
"Im due to fly from Scotland a week today and have been looking forward to it and crossing my fingers for months. Cancelled my accomdation last night and the free cancellation is up, but hopeful yet for a change next week. No covid deaths in Scotland for a few weeks now, and it seems a little unfair. Considered ordering an NHS test but i have no symptoms and it feels immoral and the private ones are too expensive"
"There has been an update within the last 10 minutes, but it seems it is just a case of making sure you keep up to date with information with regards returning to the UK from Hungary.No change on the Hungarian side unfortunately with a 14 day quarantine still in place unless you show 2 negative Covid-19 tests on arrival"
Have they still classed spain and france as green? If so thats a disgrace. Spain has 4 times more daily cases than us! How can that be justified I have no idea!
However in Scotland you are starting local lockdowns so its is just as risky as england! Especially when you can move freely between the 2 countries!
spain is yellow since yesterday. check abouthungary.hu/
"A friend has booked a surprise trip away for us this weekend to Budapest, I've just checked the travel advice and as we'll be flying from London and we don't have Covid tests (due to fly on Sat), I've said that if we go we will won't be allowed in, he seems to think that it's fine - am I right in thinking that we will be turned away at the airport and made to go back?"
"I can't tell you that you'll be turned away, but what I can tell you is your options:Option 1) Quarantine for 14 days before you are allowed to enjoy your holidayOption 2) Get private tests to bypass quarantine. My friend tried to do this (note: I just moved from Hungary). He was told it is a 5 day wait to get your first test, then you get your results 2-3 days later. Cost is around 60,000 HUF. You'll then be free to enjoy your holiday, but you'll need to get a second test before you return...this one is cheaper because you can go to the office...but I think it's still 30,000 huf. Unless you plan to be in Budapest for a very long time, it's probably best you cancel.The word is these policies can be strongly enforced...and I know in the case of my friend, they were.Edited: 10:51 am, August 13, 2020 "
