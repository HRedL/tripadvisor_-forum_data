"We are honeymooning in SA October 6-17th 2020. A lot of the attractions we want to see are near Cape Town. We'd love to spend several days in winelands. But we'd like to end the trip with a 2 night safari. I've looked at some of the safaris near CT (aquila, kagga kamma, sanbona) but I hate to spend that money and not get a true South African intimate safari honeymoon vibe. Therefore I've been looking into Lush Game Lodge in Pilanesberg. I fear Kruger is too far for the amount of time we are actually spending at the lodge. We would care hire from J'berg - no issue driving as my fiance spent 3 months in New Zealand last year. Flying from the US is cheaper into J'berg anyway. We don't want to spend $1000 pp per night so no ultra luxury. Any other suggestions on flights, lodges, etc? Open to suggestions. Thank you for your time!"
"Madikwe has great lodges and a great reserve, a good option if you don’t want to go to Kruger.Many options across different prices and 3-4hrs from Johannesburg. Sandy - owner - Love Africa Travel"
There are many other private lodges in the Black Rhino Reserve that is more reasonable priced.Agnes - owner - Felleng tours
If you rent a car then the best is to fly from Cape Town to Lanseria airport.Easy to drive from there to Pilanesberg.
Hello & Nambiti Pvt Game Reserve would be a great option and approx 3 1/2 hours south of Johannesburg.Mark - Owner - SafariKZN
"If you can swing 3 nights, I highly recommend it. 3 nights feels so much less rushed and best chance of seeing most of what there is to see! You can fly from Cape Town to the three Kruger airports. Check out Senalala, Bateleur Safari Camp, Simbavati and Kambaku. There are others that are less expensive but might not be what you’re looking for. Madikwe has some nice options. I’m just not sure it’s any easier to get to than Kruger. There are scheduled charter flights from JNB. You’ll have to drive to Pilanesberg. Easy enough but no other options and you’ll need to leave JNB by late morning to make the afternoon game drive. Tambuti is just 5 suites and no kids under 16. A bit modern for my taste but everyone has different travel needs. Lots of other great options - check them out and see which fits your travel style the best. https:/…tambuti-private-lodge.htmlNo matter where you decide, let them know it’s your honeymoon."
"Lush is offering us a wonderful discount. Has any one that answered stayed there? We are hesitant to book right now however, due to vivid-19. Do you all have any suggestions for travel insurance? I was planning on booking the entire trip myself?"
"We selected a policy with Travel Insured International at the same time we started booking reservations for our honeymoon, also this October & November. Luckily, we chose the cancel for any reason plan, which was significantly more expensive, but with the total cost we felt it was justified.Now very happy that we shelled out the extra money for the comprehensive plan given the COVID-19 situation. We're still optimistic that travel will resume 6+ months out but, who knows for sure. Once cautionary note, with the cancel for any reason plans, you must purchase them within a certain time frame after you book your first reservation or they become invalid.Good luck!"
And also check carefully even Cancel for any Reason plans as some are now excluding COVID-19 now (bought previously should be ok).
"I've been looking into Travel Insured Intl thanks! We haven't booked anything yet so trying to figure out the insurance first. Thanks for the heads up!!! Also, starting to look at hotels....Will hotel pools be open in October in SA? Even in Western cape? I would hate to pick based on that and then the pool not be open. TIA"
"Check https://www.insuremytrip.com/ for options. Read the fine print carefully. For most cancel for any reason policies, you need to buy within a weeks or two from first trip payment. You need to insure everything that is prepaid or you lose the coverage. I use the Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit card to cover up to $10,000 per trip (we never spend that much) and buy medical insurance through GeoBlue for affordable policies. https://www.geobluetravelinsurance.com/I book my trips myself. Travel infrastructure in S Africa is very good. I’m not familiar with Lush. I hope their 3 week shut down is effective. If there’s not comprehensive testing by October, I would be concerned to bring the virus to S Africa. Hopefully by then they’ll have tests for everyone who deplanes. I wouldn’t book anything yet. There will be many specials when we can travel again."
