"Well based on the presidents plan today, which is kinda confusing, does anyone have any idea where Kauai is at in the process? For instance, do they qualify for getting thru the “gating” part yet? To then start on phase 1..... Just wondering. And I realize there will be a lot of guessing on everyone’s part, but just interested to hear y’all’s ideas. Thx :)"
"The Trump administration guidelines are purely advisory and states will set their own standards. Hawaii will not necessarily base its actions on the President’s gating criteria.Edited: 11:02 am, April 17, 2020 "
"Well, it's really up to each individual governor. The President can put forth his recommendations, and he should, but that's it. Each governor will have the right to decide on their own and that should make them each responsible for their decisions but I suspect there's going to be more of this banding together with other governors to come up with a plan. After all, no one governor will want to be the first to stick their neck out there. Hawaii is in a unique position because it doesn't share borders with any other state. Hawaii should make a decision on it's own regardless of what , say, the west coast is doing."
The gov said yesterday that we will be following the national guidelines for now. The first one being a decline in new cases for a 14 day period. We don't meet that criteria yet. There were 11 new cases in the state yesterday no new ones on Kauai for at least 3 days. Our mayor has let private construction and landscapers go back to work.
"Good to know. Yes, appreciate info from those that are local as to what Kauai governor is deciding based on local needs, going forward. Thank you all"
"The National policy up til now is that states are on their own. Only when it comes to lifting distancing rules does the president become interested. I expect that Governors and Mayors will look at the guidelines, but make decisions based on the needs of their residents, not visitors.We are up in the air regarding our Hawaii vacation scheduled for mid to late June. We know now we can cancel all reservations and flights without penalty, but will wait on decision by the Government of Hawaii and follow their guidelines."
"Aloha from Kaua’i!Our Mayor Derek is wonderful and the vast majority of residents here are happy with the way he is handling this crisis.I hope that our Governor (sigh) won’t bow to Trump and open Hawai’i before it is safe to do so.I trust Derek and our numbers reflect the good mandates he has put into place.Trump? Well, I won’t get into politics here.Malama Pono,Janet"
Its sad that people say they will not mention politics..or bring politics into a conversation...but yet they do ...
"""Its sad that people say they will not mention politics..or bring politics into a conversation...but yet they do ...""Agree. And another thing I notice in various forums and social media sites are the different opinions on how this is being handled by government and health officials. People with little or no financial impact have one view while others who are losing there jobs and livelihood possibly forever have different views. As someone who probably won't be financially impacted, I can understand both sides and certainly don't place blame on anyones opinion. Like has been said by others, the financial and social (suicide) side of shutting down our country may be worse than the virus itself. Only time will tell."
"As the financially-incentified GOP candidate so often says, ""We'll see about that."" Did I just make up a new word: 'incentified'? Sounds good enough to be corporate-speak. Sorry, but there's no way this issue cannot be ""political"". I'd prefer it to be 'medical' or at least 'scientific', but it's not."
"You just did. I would imagine that the locals will decide that the curve has flattened, which it has, and they want to open up the island to tourism and get food on their table. They will pressure the Gov."
"It’s only political if people make it that way. Plenty of people across the political spectrum have widely varying opinions. A states’ rights conservative might favor keeping power with local government. A Trump fan might favor the President making choices for all. It’s not a clear political divide. Very silly to try to make it one.My fear in easing restrictions is that we’ll throw away the sacrifices already made. If we have a spike in infections after trying to open things up, it may well set the clock back to the beginning. We’ll have gained little for what we’ve given up over the last month. We would all feel very foolish if that were to happen."
"PS Terri, Hawaii is America"
"I know quite a few unemployed locals. Not a one of them wants the Governor to reopen the state to tourists yet. We understand that we are in no position to take in thousands of people with limited resources and testing. And most people here still value life over dollar signs. Eventually things will get back to normal, but the pressure on local officials is to stay closed - not reopen."
"“My fear in easing restrictions is that we’ll throw away the sacrifices already made. If we have a spike in infections after trying to open things up, it may well set the clock back to the beginning. We’ll have gained little for what we’ve given up over the last month. We would all feel very foolish if that were to happen.“ Exactly. Why go through what we already have been through to only backslide? One of best friends has a salon on Kauai and she’s been closed since the SIP. She’s losing money everyday yet she doesn’t want to open up to only have another closure because of more cases. Her salon is more frequented by residents , and visitors that know they can go there for half the price of the resorts, but she’s still willing to wait it out. Sacrifice now for it to get better sooner imo."
Hi Lynne. Hence why I titled it “opening up America” :)
"""Sorry, but there's no way this issue cannot be 'political'.""It's beyond discouraging to me that, at a time when the country needs to unify around fighting the coronavirus ""war"", both parties are taking every opportunity to weaponize what they perceive as the wrong opinions or actions of the other. Read your history folks. Wasn't it a president admired and respected by both political parties who said, ""a house divided against itself cannot stand""?"
"“Wasn't it a president admired and respected by both political parties who said, ""a house divided against itself cannot stand""?Yes, that was said by a president who was admired and respected. Unfortunately, this president isn’t admired or respected by the majority of the country. He’s an egomaniac who is only concerned about his ratings and figuring out someone to blame for his gross incompetence."
"Now, I've only been on Kauai for 5 years but I have been in Hawaii for the last 19. What gets really frustrating is folks from thousands of miles away are posting what they think residents or locals or transplants or native Hawaiians feel or should do. Jenn is absolutely correct and I agree with her assessment of the vibe here. Plenty of my neighbors are out of work and I haven't heard one of them say they are up to going back to work until they know their kapuna, children and the rest of their families and friends are as safe as possible. Everyone is aware of there being no guarantees but they aren't ready to take chances with their lives. What folks forget also is there are still a lot of people around that went through hurricane Iniki. This community knows how to survive with very little. They rely on each other. Other than staying home this is almost a cake walk to them. We do have electricity and running water!!"
"Regardless of reopening plans, the real reopening will only happen when citizens TRUST the information they are getting and feel safe. It is IMPOSSIBLE to not be political because even though the virus sees no party, color, sex, age or citizenship - the preparation, evaluation, and implementation of a plan IS political because it depends on our leaders to LEAD US. This ""both sides"" garbage got us in this situation, and it will not solve it either. We need a plan - a COHERENT plan, appropriate attention to science and experts and a way to know where we are, where we will be in a month, where we will be in a year. This can not be done on a state by state basis. Also the quote mentioned attributed to a president is very appropriate - but when the leader of our country is actively asking for people to stand up to their governors, then I think someone needs to go back to school and learn the lessons of the Civil War. People are dying because of this lack of a plan and that is the truth any way you slice it."
"“They rely on each other” Yes! I am so glad that my granddaughter, who had a wonderful job with Outfitters, and her parents get to ride this out on Kaua’i. They have so many wonderful friends there, and they definitely look out for each other!"
"“What folks forget also is there are still a lot of people around that went through hurricane Iniki. This community knows how to survive with very little. They rely on each other. Other than staying home this is almost a cake walk to them. We do have electricity and running water!!“ That’s what my friend was saying in ‘18 when all the hurricanes were circling. She had just moved to Kauai a few months before Iniki. She said the island knows how to take care of each other. It’s similar to where I live. We’re a community that comes together. We survived the ‘89 quake and too many to count floods. Maybe it makes a difference if you live someplace that you are just happy to be there. Yes people worry about money but we know that usually works itself out. If anyone needs help people are their to offer what they can. As soon as possible we’ll be on Kauai again, but we all need to ride this out until it’s safe to travel, work closely etc."
"People aren’t dying because of the lack of a plan. They’re dying because of a virus. Life is not controllable. It is not predictable. Control and predictability are illusions, and always have been.Asking for and expecting a plan is simply asking to be lied to and misled. Anyone who claims to have a plan is peddling a pile of BS. Anyone who thinks science holds all the answers has no more credibility than a preacher believing that an ancient book has all of the answers.Anger isn’t going to solve any of it. Blaming each other for events that were unforeseeable isn’t going to solve it.Not every problem has a solution. Sometimes you just have to accept that. We’re all of four months into this thing. Not a long time at all. More time is required for it to play out. We need to do what we can, while accepting that life may not be normal for a short while—short while being in the grand scheme of things. Not the impatient American scheme of things."
""" If we have a spike in infections after trying to open things up, it may well set the clock back to the beginning.""It's going to happen. It's a given and predictable. When people come out of their houses and start leaving their homes we will have a mass of people who have not achieved immunity to the virus out in the public. If social distancing is not practiced by both individuals and businesses thee will be a temporary setback. We were able to flatten the curve by everyone staying home but when the quarantines are over there will be a lot of non-immunized people out there. There WILL be new cases after the quarantines are lifted.Hopefully it will be few. I just hope our politicians can stop themselves from playing the blame game.Edited: 1:11 am, April 18, 2020 "

And they may not stink to us, but they surely do to someone else.As diverse as our Country is, the timelines for re-opening will be equally diverse, success in some areas, and sadly, more hurdles in others. We all have to be patient, something that's so very difficult in this ""microwave"" society that we've become. Hopefully, this sheltering in place that most are having to endure will remind us what truly matters, to care for each other and work together to get our lives back to normal, whatever that may be. What's truly unfortunate is that so many of our officials can't work together to solve what will likely be the most important issue in their political careers..."
"""What's truly unfortunate is that so many of our officials can't work together to solve what will likely be the most important issue in their political careers...""Agree. And both sides are guilty. The name of the game is stop the other side in anything they want to do even if it's good for the people. All in the name of having a win. Sure, the opening of the country has to be slow and with a well thought out plan. Let's just hope the usual Washington D.C. politics don't bog it down. That's why I promote each governor making their own decisions. The last thing we need is committees and more committees."
"I wonder if it would not be possible to open up individual islands if some are doing better than others ? I would think they would still want to limit and require either testing or quarantine of all arriving people from other islands possibly, and for sure from other states or countries. I'm sure the mayors and governor are looking at some of those options. Hopefully would allow parts of Hawaii to get moving again even if the whole state was not able to.We can, and probably will open up some counties before others, but we don't have as easy a time of restricting or controlling people from other counties or even other states from entering."
Federal government closed borders to foreign travel. Hawaii governor and mayors closed everything else. Its up to those who closed things to reopen them. Don't use a straw-man for you arguments. Guidelines aren't mandates and rules.

""". In reality, they’re just different sides of the same coin. European politics have much, much more diversity than we do.""Mike L is absolutely right on this one. We're set up as a 2-party system , both parties vying for control every 4 years.It's all about them. If anyone thinks one party or the other is all about the people, as they like to profess, dream on. It's time to refuse to be a pawn of either party. There aren't only two ways of approaching things. Extremism in both parties has taken over. At one point most Americans hovered towards the center - center right or center left. There wasn't the huge difference in philosophies we see today. My opinion is we can greatly blame the media for the division. Other Western countries have multiple parties allowing more choices. It also works in inserting more philosophies and settling the ground between the extremist parties and finding that sweet spot somewhere in the middle.And rjbeach, what you said about the Republicans of the 60's - 80's not being welcome in today's Republican party? Well, the same goes for the Democrat party. If Bill Clinton, or even JFK, as only 2 examples, were to run today based on their past philosophies, they too would not be welcomed by their party."

"Venturing back to opening up the state our Governor actually put in tighter restrictions with respect to beaches, boating and hiking today. No more walking or running on the beach, boats are limited to 2 individuals already 6 feet apart and hiking is limited to 2 family members only. Still too many groups out not respecting social distancing.I don't think we will be reopening soon, especially as our new cases jumped today thanks to a cluster on the Big Island."
"Just fun with statistics. 4 active Kauai cases only need 4 more to double.That's a 100% increase. 70,000 residents.I bet if they ever test more you'll find quite a few recovered cases without even knowing. Here from Kauai. https://www.kauai.gov/COVID-19As an international destination you may need to wait for a required vaccine. Like some countries for malaria or smallpox."
Kaua'i has been really casual about testing.........maybe they don't want to know.

"Any test sites, fish?"
Wilcox https:/…
"Wilcox https:/…The only way you can get a test in California is if you meet certain criteria. My friend that is positive never would have received a test if she didn’t have MS. Her case was mild and so far it isn’t any worse than a severe cold, luckily."
Testing data : https:/…On a test percentage per population we are in-line with the Big Island and not that far behind Maui.
"Well, I wasn't commenting about California....So----as I said, there haven't been any drive through or community efforts to do proactive testing on Kauai. Looks like fish owes me an apology for her nasty remark.Edited: 10:17 am, April 19, 2020 "
I mentioned California because I was wondering if the guidelines are the same. Thanks so much.
Here is an article on Kauai’s drive through testing. It looks like you need a doctors referral which obviously makes https:/…
"I mean testing drives like the ones done on Maui and Oahu.......as I said, ""proactive"" testing efforts. We have hundreds of test results outstanding right now, because hundreds of free tests were done in different places on Maui, this week alone. They started doing test 'drives' or concentrated efforts, at the end of March.The one you linked at Wilcox was back at the very beginning. It was only a preliminary thing-and as said, needed symptoms and a doctor's referral. I haven't seen any updates/community testing efforts like we have had on Maui, or they have had on Oahu.My point is that if ya' don't test, ya' can't have an accurate count. You can't pin down things like a cluster (e.g.Maui's hospital or the Big Island's MacDonalds'). You can't identify ""hot spots"" or troubled areas. So how do you *safely* reopen? Do you just say ""we haven't had a new case in 14 days so we're good""?That's why I said that Kaua'i has been ""casual"" about testing. And I don't see anything that makes that statement wrong, from anyone. Attacking me for saying that wasn't right.......because I wasn't 'uninformed'.I think Kaua'i's mayor has done an outstanding job in so many ways. But aggressive testing is another tool he needs to pursue for everyone's health and safety. That's not just *my opinion*.....it's straight from the experts' recs."
"If Hawaii's Governor and Mayors are smart they won't open up the Islands until travelers from the Mainland and other countries can prove they are virus free. I say this as someone who has a June vacation planned. But we don't have anywhere near widespread testing on the Mainland. Almost every country in Europe tests far more of it's population, proportionally than we do in the US. Testing is very limited here in Oregon, for a variety of reasons, but the main one is the lack of sufficient tests.Edited: 2:19 pm, April 19, 2020 "
"Hawaii, like everywhere--has also had shortages of test kits. But that hasn't been near the problem it was. Private labs and groups have been super about getting kits. In Maui county, they have been working with our mayor and doing a great service for all of us."
"It's my understanding the testing on Maui and Oahu were in direct reaction to where breakouts are occurring. Also as far as I know you still have to have certain symptoms to be tested on these islands also. At least that is what HNN has been reporting. It's also what my primary care physician told me.Kauai hasn't had the need to do anymore testing. The testing facility at Wilcox is still there and from what Dh tells me there are very few folks going through it. The hospital as of today is very quiet. Praying that we won't need any more but if the need arises then Kauai is ready to make that happen. I am always willing to apologize for a remark I make if there is an apology needed. It wasn't ""nasty"" or an ""attack"""
"You can’t get a test here unless you’re veteran, front line work or you doctor jumps through hoops to get one ordered. There are no drive through test sights in our county. There are tents in parking lots of the hospital but no drive through. If we could actually get the kits it would be a different story."
"On Maui, the very first drive through tests required symptoms and a doctor referral--those started on March 23rd. The drive being done for the last several weeks have not. It's not hard to find the accurate info. The tests offered on Moloka'i, in Hana, Wailuku, and even the lowly West side have not required those things--as I have posted many times.So I guess Kaua'i can reopen for all business soon. Good luck with that.Edited: 2:45 pm, April 19, 2020 "
Do you mean businesses for island residents only? I hope so. Testing is so randomly available on the mainland I wouldn’t want anyone getting on a plane without taking a test first. It would nice if there was national strategy to get it done.
"DC area is a hot spot but if I wanted to I could get a couple of flights anywhere in the US and have a covidcation. A real bargain, likecthree day old sushi."
"Why stop there, SC? If Kaua'i is so safe and wonderful, hey, let's bring the tourists back! Drop the quarantine for Kaua'i and those pesky stay at home orders.(This of course disregards the tourists who have continued to visit many places, including Hawaii-when asked not to)."
My head is spinning after reading this thread for the last hour!WHOA!--Lori
"My head exploded. Never knew there were so many scientists and politicians on here!Yes, that was said by a president who was admired and respected. Fortunately , this president is admired and respected by the majority of the country."""
"Maybe we are doing better because our health care workers don't go to work when they are sick and start a cluster at the worst possible place, thus requiring more testing. I do not think the island is being cavalier about testing, nor are we planning to open up anytime soon. We do still need a doctor's referral but they are hoping to open up more widely in the next week. But if you have symptoms you get a test, and I don't think they have gotten around to testing healthy people anywhere on island yet. We were the first to lock down, to curfew, to wear masks, to severely limit people in our stores, to do checkpoints on roads and at the airports. My guess is that is contributing to lower numbers, both in cases and in tests. But don't call us cavalier because we have less people that qualify for testing."

"I actually agree with Koloagirl. How about we all focus on where the real problems are, what is happening on the mainland, maybe our own areas. In watching the state's numbers every day I realized that this much angst discussion about Hawaii and the virus (myself included) is ridiculous considering what is happening elsewhere, in the big scheme of things.

"I for one, as a lover of Kauai and Maui, would like to see this topic closed. I cannot speak for other tourist, or island frequenters but I feel very unwelcome at the moment! Sad too since I have come every year since 1996.--Lori"
I love Hawaii Island but I have been aware for a long time that Native Hawaiians and locals (not mainland transplants) have had at best mixed feelings about tourists. Maybe it shows more now.I have been coming since 1990.The other tourists started annoying me more since about 2010.
"The whole reason I asked this question in the original post was to get a feel for how things were going locally. Not meant to cause any back and forth fighting. Everyone is welcome to their own ‘opinion’ and outlook, as well as the facts that speak for themselves. I have only been following the World, United States and Oregon numbers. Was wanting some local info from the people that live there. I could have as well, looked up some info on Kauai myself, but thought this would be easier. Lazy, I guess. And sometimes the ‘numbers’ don’t always give you the feel for what’s actually going on locally. We have postponed our May trip for next May. We will see what is going on by then. Who knows? This will be our first trip to Kauai and I hope not our last. Still looking forward to it, when the time is right. Thank you all that kindly replied with good information. I appreciate it."
"If you want the thread to go,poof Terri just delete your OP."
"Here's my 2 cents from the Big Island. My neighbors and friends are not so content as FishDiva. The people where I live tend to be more local and native Hawaiian, and considerably lower income than most of the state. My family is sitting happy in our 5th week of ""safe at home"" and things aren't much different for us because we are self employed, already worked online 3 out of 4 weeks a month (obviously the travel off island has been cancelled), and live in the country. However, trips into town are sad. Phone conversations with some friends have revealed that two who own businesses will likely never be reopening. I've been hiring people to do odd jobs around our property because they literally have no money to buy groceries, and state unemployment has been slow. That said, I have heard NO people say they wish the floodgates of outside tourism would open. Everyone knows that would be a disaster, when the state has yet to put any meaningful screening procedures in place or even figure out how to responsibly follow up with people who are supposed to be in self-quarantine. What people DO want here is a lift on ""non-essential"" businesses (in other words every business that wants to be open to locals should open), an end to the ridiculous checkpoints, beach patrols, and ticketing of locals, and full reopening of beaches and parks for residents. While we still have new cases every day, Hawai'i has been trending down for quite some time in terms of active cases. A couple weeks ago we were well over 220, last I saw the number was below 180. Big Island still yet to has a single person go to the hospital with COVID19, much less be put on a ventilator. The harm from 37 percent unemployment rates and shuttering of long time family owned businesses feels a lot greater than COVID19 right now. The pain is starting, and we are pulling together and helping our neighbors however we can, but resources get thin when more than half of the population is on the edge.Edited: 5:17 pm, April 20, 2020 "
"Hawaii needs to put its residents first. Hawaii residents are practicing social distancing and wearing masks, etc. If they could keep people from their frivolous vacations, they could open up the beaches, let more businesses get back to work, let restaurants open with less seating.The only reason this can not happen is TRAVEL related. It is the travelers that will keep everyone penned up and confined. They can't do the right thing for the residents until they find a way to keep people from traveling there."
This thread is useless. Mostly just a platform for holier-than-thou types to preach at the rest of us about what “must” or “must not” happen.

"Good question, JOEJAX. I happen to exist in both camps; at risk for my age and immune compromised, but not yet retired, so materially impacted by the economic shutdown and financial market swings. So I sympathize and can empathize with both groups, but from what I hear and observe, there’s not much of that going on between them."

"I hope so, I keep reading that this quarantine is through April 30th or May 3rd depending on what I’m reading. And my gf and I are scheduled to fly out May 4. Kauai looks to be in good shape and I’m not worried about getting refunded if my flights and Airbnb get cancelled, just waiting to see if the mandated quarantine will extend beyond May 4. I’m realistic about my chances of actually flying on May 4 but hoping for the best."
"We’re in the same position, Ariston, though out flight is later in May. We are assuming that either the quarantine or the prohibition on vacation rentals, or perhaps both, are likely to be extended, which would cause us to cancel. But if the government ends the quarantine and ends the prohibition on vacation rentals, and says that it is ready to receive tourists again, then I guess we will need to make a quick decision about whether to go or to cancel. So for now we are just waiting but I would put the odds of this trip happening very low."
"Oahu just extended its stay-at-home order to May 31st. Will be surprised if other islands don't do the same thing, at least for a part of May. And if we have to stay home I can't imagine them lifting the quarantine."
"Remember that except for the BI, the stay at home orders were done before the quarantine, by the mayors.Edited: 12:15 am, April 22, 2020 "
"At this point, I sort of want the quarantine order, or the ""no vacation rentals"" order, or both of them, to be extended to cover our dates, so that the decision to cancel will be easy. I am just waiting for that to happen. Because if the Hawaii/Kauai government lifts those orders (or allows them to expire), then it seems like it is saying the Islands are open for tourism -- and then it will be a harder decision."
"Swallace, I broke out laughing when I read your hilarious comment"
"RJ, did you mean me? What hilarious comment?SW"
"It was DWallace. I just wanted to comment without actually showing what he/she wrote, but here it is. It is in reference to a post about about Lincoln being admired and respected. I thought his/her's last sentence was ridiculous, but actually wasn't sure it was meant to be facetious""Yes, that was said by a president who was admired and respected(Lincoln). Fortunately , this president is admired and respected by the majority of the country."""
"Ran across this commercial survey. https:/…Read it yourself to decide how valid results are. But responses indicated that Almost half said a VACCINE was necessary before they would feel comfortable returning to normal life. That was the most frequent response, more than any government opening up statements.In related article about the survey, a reported 45 percent of consumers thought the pandemic would last six months (from April) or longer. https:/…So I don't think one needs worry about rushingbto book for fear of being shut out of hotel rooms, condos, flights.Half of us say now we ain't going anywhere."
"Hi @AristonC, Kauai Mayor's Emergency Rule #5 (Amendment #3) identifies effective date through May 3. Gov. Ige's 5th Supplement identifies April 30. I suspect both will be extended."
">>> Also the quote mentioned attributed to a president is very appropriate - but when the leader of our country is actively asking for people to stand up to their governors, then I think someone needs to go back to school and learn the lessons of the Civil War. <<<Ha ha ha, I hate to drag this topic further away from travel, but this just cracked me up.""That"" president who made the statement about ""a house divided"" didn't actively ask people to ""stand up to their governors"", but rather to shoot them and he recruited an entire army of 2,128,948 men to do just that.Lincoln is beloved only in hindsight and grudgingly so in some quarters.As to travel matters, Hawaii is inflicting more damage on itself then every natural disaster the last 100 years combined. Maybe it will be worth it, or perhaps not."
"“ Lincoln is beloved only in hindsight and grudgingly so in some quarters.” Well, Scott, I’m sure you’re much more brilliant than most on this forum. I know that’s what you want us to believe.

"As interesting as the Lincoln presidency, and the role that revisionism may have played in his subsequent legacy, is, don’t you think all that is a bit far astray for a forum that is supposed to be focused on tourism in Kauai?"

I agree with ChiSue that there is no way that this issue cannot be political.How sad that our leader could suggest injecting disinfectants to cure the virus!Put some masking tape on Trump's mouth and let the experts give the Trump daily pro-Trump infomercial!
DWallace56 I think your first post was deleted as I went back to look. So I am answering your second. Congratuations on moving on from being a one post wonder.
DWallace's first post is still there.
Thanks for contributing for once RJ! I am referring to your last post.
"Not sure what your problem is DWallace, but good luck in your world. Happy May Day"
No problems in my little world RJ. Everything’s going great! Thanks for checking. Hope your able resolve your issues before they take you over! If your lucky you will get 4 more!

Have you heard any other updates on the state opening? We are scheduled to fly to Kauai for our 5 year anniversary on June 3rd.
"Not yet..though the state is going to announce/post a NEW 'dashboard, with colored circles, and other fun little things.I expect the quarantine to be extended through June. Are you prepared to not leave your room for 14 days?"
"""I expect the quarantine to be extended through June. Are you prepared to not leave your room for 14 days?""Can you please let us know how you expect that? Honest question"
"Brian, I base that on many, many comments/signals being sent by state people and DOH as well. For example, most agree that we need reliable ""instant"" tests and a fully staffed network of contract tracers-neither of which exists in any meaningful quantity now. We also have a new form and new rules being implemented-why bother, if the quarantine is ending in 2 weeks?Rental cars have been cut off, too-again, why bother for only a few weeks? Why ask hotels to join a program of one time keys unless.........So, my belief and opinion is based on those things and more that I see here on Maui. Obviously, I could be totally wrong!SWEdited: 4:00 pm, May 13, 2020 "
Gotcha. The dashboard announcement will hopefully clarify things. cross-fingers. Then no one will need to post questions on this forum any longer on when Hawaii will be open to tourists
"Brian, thing is--""open"" and ""what people expect"" are often 2 very different things.Just because one can fly to any island now or next month, that doesn't mean the experience after arrival will please people. Quarantine or no quarantine, places are still going to closed, operating on a very limited basis, or maybe out of business. Boat tours, helicopter or plane tours, luau, hiking tours, shops, restaurants, on and on--if people are expecting those things to all be ""normal"" they could be very unhappy. Even hotel pools may be closed or limited. This is such uncharted territory for everyone."
"We were coming June 6th for a week to celebrate our 10th Anniversary and our flights got cancelled last month, along with not being able to get our rental car let alone being quarantined for 14 days think they are extending thru June. Have many friends that live there that advise us to hold off til 2021 as they are trying to overcome the epidemic with all the closures, etc. thankfully got all our money refunded and when Kauai is ready for people to come will rebook then"
"Alaska has cancelled our direct flights and rescheduled on same day, less convenient flights to and from the Big Island June 11-June 28. I am fully expecting the quarantine to be extended, but until they do we will hold on to reservations. Frankly though I hope they decide sooner rather than later so that we can cancel everything and plan for the future."
Kaua'i has announced they are extending the quarantine through June. I posted a new thread about it.I think the Mayor and guv dickered and reached a bargain on this....in exchange for being allowed to extend the quarantine Kawakami had to agree to open the beaches and make Kaua'i be the guinea pig after all?No one else has published an extension on the quarantine....yet. Typically that has only come from the guv.
"Brian makes a good point. Many ""plans"" have been talked about as if they were a done deal. This ranged from mandatory ankle bracelets that would track tourists movements to tourists all being herded to one location on Oahu for their quarantine to the hotel room keys that would work only one time, etc etc . The list goes on and on. We've been told here that tourism has been shut down to the end of the year but the source never coughed up a link to prove it. Most is hearsay or hearsay of hearsay and I would also add much of it probably wishful thinking emanating from the anti-tourism crowd. People read these forums and take it word for word and make their decisions based on it. Thankfully we have posters who will repeatedly post the link to the actual decrees to give some balance to it all. How about we all wait to see what the Governor and Mayors of each island decide on when they announce it? I know people are chomping at the bit to make a decision. Unfortunately, all you have is what you have - that is the current orders. Anything beyond that is pure fodder for the imagination no matter how knowledgeable or close to the source a person seems to be. If that's not good enough then you get to make a decision and as Akamai pointed out, even if the quarantine and the ban on short-term vacation rentals are lifted you're still left with a not-great situation and probably not the kind of vacation you're thinking of. Knowing the sentiment in Hawaii right now I sure wouldn't want to be arriving a day or two after the bans are lifted. Hawaii is a very different situation from what we know on the mainland. Travel between states is not looked at in the same way as it is in Hawaii."
"Napa, I posted around the same time as you......and included a link about the quarantine extension.Ref the one time use hotel keys----that is also a truth. It's a newer idea from the State Leg:https://www.kitv.com/story/42127343/majority…Sen. Case also wants the FAA to make testing *before* boarding a plane to Hawaii mandatory. I doubt that will happen:https:/…I always try to post links if I can.SW :-)"
I know. SW. My comment was not aimed at you.
"The video of the mayors program that was held yesterday is very informative. There's a link for it in another thread, I can't do links on my IPad. Maui's mayor will be announcing how Maui is moving forward today."
Maui's mayor announced how Maui is moving forward yesterday :-).
