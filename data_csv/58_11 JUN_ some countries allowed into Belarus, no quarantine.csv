"BUT: you have to have a negative covid-19 test done 48 hours before the trip. If that's the case and you are coming from one of the countries below, self-isolation is no longer mandatory (Healthcare Ministry of Belarus).Republic of AustriaRepublic of Albania;Kingdom of Belgium;Republic of Bulgaria;Bosnia and Herzegovina;Hungary;Federal Republic of Germany;Hellenic RepublicKingdom of Denmark;Ireland;Iceland;The Kingdom of Spain;Italian Republic;Latvian republic;Republic of Lithuania;Principality of Liechtenstein;Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;Republic of Malta;The Republic of Moldova;Principality of Monaco;Kingdom of Norway;Republic of Poland;Portuguese Republic;Romania;Republic of Northern Macedonia;Republic of Serbia;The Slovak Republic;Republic of Slovenia;Republic of FinlandFrench Republic;Republic of Croatia;MontenegroCzech Republic;Swiss Confederation;Kingdom of Sweden;Republic of EstoniaPeople's Republic of China."
So this means trips under 10 days will not need any registration?
"The rule about registrations is unrelated to the post you are replying.But yes, it is understood that, after 1 July, foreigners staying less than 10 days in Belarus are not required to register. You might register anyways since it is quick to do online, in case the border guards change their minds."
Sorry. I posted on the wrong thread. Thanks for answer!
"Hi! Do you know which rules apply if you are travelling from a country on this list, but transiting through a country that is not on the list (the Netherlands)? Would you be required to stay in quarantine or not?Furthermore, does the rule with the negative COVID-19 test apply only to foreign citizens, or should Belarusian citizens arriving from abroad present the test results as well?"
"The test thing applies to the foreign visitors into Belarus. No idea about transit, my guess is, the previous country before Minsk will be checked against the list.Check with our nearest consulate.A"
"Almost all of Europe, but no Netherlands? And Sweden *is* on the list? What in the world is going on here?"
"The Netherlands counting of covid-19 deaths is less reliable, and different from other countries. In Sweden everyone who had covid-19 and died counts. Like for example those in care homes, they count if they had covid-19 even if they didn't die because of it. Even if someone in Sweden die in a freak accident and had covid-19, they count to the statistics. These people are not counted in the Netherlands."
"Didn't want to point out Sweden in that way, so no offense intended. All I know is that we're doing beter (in some cases MUCH better) than some other countries that are on the list. Just wondering what the criteria are. Comparing the list with the numbers on for example https://vm.ee/en/information-countries-and-qâ€¦ should raise some eyebrows."
"Folks, relax, the update is updated, no tests / self-isolation required for the listed countries as of 12th of June. To be double checked tomorrow, on 15th of June.A"
"That gives me more hope for my trip in September. Now, if only Lithuania opens its border to people from Sweden also, cause that's where I will be traveling from. Happy to see there is progress with Belarus.Edited: 1:31 pm, June 14, 2020 "
"@Andrei: maybe when your country (the Netherlands in my case) is not on the list, you can enter if you DO have a negative test with you? Yeah I know, wishful thinking..."
Lithuania opened up the other day.A
