Hi I’m due to travel to Dubai in August and would like to know how people how going about getting the Covid test for arrival at Dubai airport. What companies are people looking at to have the test with and also thoughts on going about these maximum of 4 days. Just would like other people’s thoughts on it. Thanks
"Here’s a link to some information about Covid testing on arrival at DXB for residents, and a bit lower down the article, for testing of tourist visitors from today, July 7th...https:/…"
Thank you.
"We also travel in August and this covid certificate is our main worry.I have no idea how we can obtain this for adults and children, we cannot risk having to self isolate upon arrival."
"Same here. There’s 7 of us in our party, including one 10 year old. I’m hoping that the rules may change, if not then we will have to take the test at Dubai airport as I can’t see how we would get the test results in the UK within 96 hours of flightEdited: 3:46 am, July 08, 2020 "
"@ taylr - Where have you got the words ""covid certificate"" from, as they're not in the protocols referenced?It's important everyone reads the docs clearly, and take responsibility for understanding them.It's totally possible to get results within the timescale before flying. DO NOT confuse the Health Declaration Form with test results, nor the declaration to accept all medical and quarantine costs if you don't have medical insurance coverage.As for "" we cannot risk having to self isolate upon arrival"" - well, the only 100% safe way is not to go to Dubai I'm afraid. There have been two separate cases recently of passengers showing results on Emirates flights where it seems they were clear before boarding. Even if you pass a test before leaving, there's no guarantee you won't show any symptoms on arrival, and as it stands, it seems you'd be expected to quarantine should this be the case (hence the need for insurance or to cover costs).It's possible to get private PCR tests, at least in the UK, before flying - but they're not cheap.PS. Not wanting to sound pessimistic, but it's important everyone understands the rules clearly and the possible consequences. Don't overlook the consequences of travelling whilst FCO advises against it, not least for the impact on insurance cover.Here is the FCO advice for UAE and the two forms you're presently looking at to enter (Health Declaration Form and Quarantine Procedure Form)https:/…entry-requirementshttps://c.ekstatic.net/ecl/documents/dubai-a…https:/…health-declaration-e-form.pdfEdited: 4:07 am, July 08, 2020 "
Are they not asking tourists to provided a certificate to prove they have tested negative?I would love to get my refund but my holiday company say the holiday is still going ahead and the communication is very slow from them.
"I don't think you're issued with a 'certificate' as such. I know friends who have had the NHS test and they were issued with a confirmation email and text message stating they tested negative. I'd expect much the same from private practices, although not 100% certain to this. I'd also expect the printed version of the email to suffice on arrival at Dubai. How else would you confirm otherwise. #1 I think Justine D was referring to tests in the UK in readiness for travelling to Dubai, not the test once in Dubai."
"The official statement from the media office 21/6/20 did mention a ""certificate"". ""tourists required to present recent COVID 19 negative certificate....""https:/…20protocolsI think this is what has caused the confusion"
I have done some research and you can get tests done but mostly by a home test and you get a certificate. But they are extremely costly some being over £200. It’s still does not solve the problems of getting this test within the 96 hours as its by post. You can’t risk going and having the Test at the airport because of the cost of having a positive test or loosing the cost of your holiday as it’s a lot of money. It’s a total nightmare.
"The root cause of the issue is Dubai's communications are hardly ever consistent of late.For instance, the official protocol announcement from DMO included a line of copy referencing a certificate, but the issued protocols didn't include the term at all. So - what certificate? Who knows? Par for the course I'm afraid, and the same thing has happened recently with ""must have medical insurance""Taking a bit of interpretation, one could read the initial communications from 22 Jun as proof of negative result should be carried for check-in at the home airport, not Dubai, otherwise, you're going to be tested in Dubai (as well as any accordant declarations). For the avoidance of doubt, if you're a British National looking to visit Dubai or the UAE, please make the FCO advice the first place you check for info. It's less likely to be contradictory as your information will only come from one source, as opposed to Dubai's various authorities."
"@ Justine - and that's exactly why the FCO advice is currently against non-essential travel to the UAE.This is why it's prudent to discuss options with your travel provider what your rights are, and what options they can offer, as whilst the advice is in place you may have a better chance of a refund rather than risk it."
"Anyone have any idea how long it takes to get the results through after testing at the AIrport?I am intending to test first within 96hrs in UK. However, i would like to know how long this may take if we are showing symptons on arrival."
"I think the key question is being lost about talk of certificates, the morality of NHS tests or otherwise.If you're booked to travel to somewhere your Government is saying not to go, and should you ignore that advice you're potentially opening yourself up to financial risk, why not just follow the advice whilst your rights still support you? If you've booked a package holiday and your rights are for a refund, why not take that opportunity and be reassured? Why not explore the contingencies and options whilst the situation is in your favour - e.g. FCO advice, PTR 2018 etc. > At least then if the situation changes or improves - happy days!The cost of tests or the merits of using the NHS isn't the point; you're still at risk to travel without medical cover or against FCO advice."
"@ Billy - some arrivals to DXB have had their test results to the app by the end of the day, although of course, it could be a little longer. Perhaps work on 2-3 days for over-caution."
"Hi, I've also got a holiday scheduled for end of Aug, subject to FCO travel advice I will be going. The covid test is a worry, cheapest test I've found is £59 which is better than £125 -£200 prices I've also seen. I think it is possible to do the test and get the results emailed to you so that you get the results before arriving, just need to time it so the result is valid when you arrive. I trust the e mail results will suffice as companies are charging more for a certificate. I don't want to loose the first days of my holiday locked in a hotel room in self isolation while I wait for result of airport test. But will keep an eye on this thread as will be interested to see how this works and how quickly the results take. I arrive late at night, if results are back as quickly as the next morning I may consider not paying for test in advance as I need 5 tests in all. Hoping that 14 day quarantine on return will be relaxed by then too."
"Hi I have a trip to Dubai booked from Chicago USA connecting through London September 23rd, I have travel insurance, and employer insurance, will that insurance suffice?USA is still under level 4 do not travel, but people are starting too anyway since it hasn't been updated since March, will Americans be allowed in? Does the negative covid result need to be 96 hours before initial departure from USA?Also are visas being given upon arrival now?Thanks"
"The £59 test is in all likelihood an antibody test and not a PCR test, which is the one that is required.As for the question from the USA traveller ""its not allowed but people are ignoring it and travelling anyway"" how very America in 2020. US travellers are not allowed into the UK and nor are they allowed into the UAE at the moment. I can't see how you would travel if you weren't allowed to get off the plane - there would be no point.I agree 100% with Shaun. At the moment most folk can avail themselves of the opportunity to move their holiday without charge (albeit there may be a price increase) whilst the FCO guideline is still in place take that opportunity or deal with the consequence, whatever that may be if you don't.Leicester in the UK is in lockdown, with a further 36 areas at risk of the sameMelbourne is in lockdownTexas, Arizona, California, Florida, Tennessee and other states are seeing daily record increases in infection.Catalonia and Galacia in Spain have gone back into lockdown.etc etcIF YOU TRAVEL AGAINST FCO ADVICE or even if the advice is lifted. what will you do if you go on your longed for holiday and the situation changes whilst you are away; either in the area that you live in in the UK or the UAE ?Don't underestimate the challenges or the potential financial cost and move your trip if at all possible"
Again just a quick one from me. The Covi-19 tracker Dubai airport app requires a UAE phone numer? Is that correct and if so what is the best way of me sourcing a SIM. Will they still be available on arrival at the airport?
"It shows on the Dubai site USA citizens are allowed, and transit through London Heathrow is allowed as long as you enter and exit on the same day and do not go through immigration. It also stated negative covid result 96hours prior to departureAgreed it would make no sense to not get off the plane, I was hoping someone located in Dubai would have more informationAs far as wanting to travel to UAE from USA with a do not fly -- I have read numerous post from UK people wanting to travel to UAE with do not flyI live in the midwest and not close to Indianapolis which has a higher covid numberInformationIndiana has had 2524 deaths with population of 6.732 millionUK has had 44,517 deaths with a population of 66.65 millionper capita UK has way more than Indiana where I live"
"I am also due to fly to Dubai, on 19th August.In terms of the idea of do not fly - clearly if the airports are open and airlines are running flights to these destinations and the countries on the other end are open for tourists (under what ever new rules) the message is not 'do not fly' the message is 'come on in, but with a few extra rules'To be fair to all here, this is where the confusion arises. Surely the airlines should be stopping the flights and holidays if the situation is unsafe?I would definitely check your travel insurance, thankfully ours covers us."
"There are different things being discussed here, and perhaps that's where the confusion comes.There can be general rules on flying, such as the little contretemps with Iran a few months back - and these are usually to avoid certain airspaces and often issued by FAA.Countries can restrict their airspace, such as GCC countries did with a certain peninsula state over the last few years.A country can stop visa issuance or close down airports, such as Dubai did in March. Countries can advise their nationals either not to travel (apart from 'essential' - which in itself, is vague and has no fixed measure) or to avoid certain countries.Countries can issue protocols, such as Dubai has done (often confusingly) for developments such as COVID-19, and this is where the test, quarantine, waiver discussions have come from.Individuals can be put on a No Fly List, such as air rage incidents or via TSCI can't speak for our cousins over the water, but not sure where the concept of a 'do not fly' is relevant to the UAE at present. As it stands, there is FCO advice in place for the UAE and no FAA restrictions, so it seems 'safe' enough in terms of airline carriers at least.Edited: 4:33 am, July 09, 2020 "
Hi just a quick update I arrived into Dubai on the 7th morning as a tourist from lhr British passport Had to take a pcr test in airport as I didn’t take it in the ukTest was taken approx 9am results arrived same day around 10pm text message to my UK number If anyone needs any info give me a shout will try and assistAnother thing to note emirates staff at Heathrow wouldn’t let anyone board without travel insurance but here at dxb airport no one asked to see it
What travel insurance did you use? As with the FCO still not having UAE on the list of exemptions I didn’t think travel insurance would be valid? Did the emirates staff actually read the policy to check if you were covered?
"The whole 'travel insurance' thing is really erratic and eccentric, at least in terms of what one is supposed to have. The protocols clearly state if you don't have insurance, you can accept the risk/costs and yet the FCO advice is to have travel insurance.So for Emirates to not be allowing boarding without something that isn't needed (according to whichever source you may read) seems 'par the course' these days.PS. In no way advocating travelling without insurance, just commenting on the vagaries.@ Mr one - thanks for the feedback, have a lovely time in Dubai. Where are you staying?Edited: 5:17 am, July 09, 2020 "
"did you have to pay for the test, did they let you go to your accommodation instantly after taking the test or did you have to wait at DXB?Edited: 6:10 am, July 09, 2020 "
"did you have to pay for the test, did they let you go to your accommodation instantly after taking the test or did you have to wait at DXB?"
#22 Some areas of Spain are also locked down but no FCO advice against travelling to Spain. Anyone would think Dubai is NOT open for tourist!! When they are in fact trying to welcome tourists. So annoying.#25 Sarah i totally agree. Good post.#27 Thanks for the post. Nice to hear from somebody who has actually seen the process in person.
Mrone - do you know if they also test the kids ? We have two 11 and 9 and not looking forward to them being tested !
No charge for the test and it takes about 3 seconds to do Swab from the nose I didn’t see any kids but I assume they’ll be tested too but it’s straight forward Once test is done your free to go and do what you like I would say it is pretty well organised once you land and no ques
This sounds much more simple than I thought. I was under the impression you had to self isolate at own cost until the results came back ?
"#36 you do, at your original hotel."
Did you have any trouble getting a visa on arrival?
"@ Mr one - have a nice time at Gevora, stay safe, and enjoy Dubai."
"Note ref awaiting test results...Bear in mind, you're signing up to the protocols and committing to cover all medical costs, as well as being logged/tracked on the app, and most of all, you're expected to comply. Not least to have at least 50$ available per day (min) to cover the costs of quarantine.As part of the form, you're agreeing to cover the cost of being isolated in a government-appointed location should you be found with the virus and also comply with the quarantine protocol.The big gap seems to be what is expected of you whilst you are awaiting results. Just because they don't say you don't have to stay in-situ until all-clear does not mean you don't have to.Edited: 10:09 am, July 09, 2020 "
Totally correct do not fly without FCO approval
What did you do with regards to the DXB COVID App and entering in a mobile number as there’s no way to enter a UK number. Did anyone at the airport check that you had the app?
Do you have to stay at the airport while waiting for test results ?
No you can go to your hotel that you have booked and wait there
Yes but but what online. As insurance is invalid against fco advice. So what's they use in it
Thats the app that does not work. The official government app is called track covid app. It caught me out too! Mines on my phone and live
At the hotel while you await your results are you confined to your room? Does the hotel even know if you're waiting for results? Provided you don't go anywhere other than hotel is anyone bothered or able to police your movements other than via the app? Don't mind being restricted to hotel for a day but don't fancy having to wait it out in the room.
The Covid DXB app won’t work for me either - which app did you use and was it acceptable for entry in to Dubai? Could you post a pic of the app icon so that we can see which is the correct one?
"@ Sarah - the app store links are in my earlier post, and it should be the DHA (Dubai Health Authority) one.Unless there is an app update to allow international numbers, you may need a local SIM to register with the app. However, it seems another option is if you use your own (existing) mobile number they should SMS the results to you also."
"Hi, As per the q and a, Trace Covid can be used by anyone in the UAE. tracecovid.ae. Take a look at who can use. ""Anyone in the UAE"".Hope this clarifies. I can not second guess the rules, but I am pretty sure that they would not expect millions of visitors (Eventually) to get a SIM. Or like previously mentioned, it may be a teething problem and they need to address.But definitely, check it out if you are not confident."
"On the Emirates flights website, it now says you need a PCR certificate if you are flying to Dubai from the following countries:Effective 10th July, if you are flying with Emirates from the countries or airports specified below, you must carry a negative PCR certificate issued by a local government approved laboratory to be accepted on the flight. If the UAE government has specified a designated laboratory in your country of origin, you must get your test certificate from that lab. Certificates must be issued no more than 96 hours before departure: Afghanistan Bangladesh Egypt India Iran Nigeria Pakistan Philippines Russian Federation Sudan Tanzania USA - Dallas Fort Worth (DFW), Houston (IAH), Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), Fort Lauderdale (FLL) and Orlando (MCO), including passengers originating from California, Florida and Texas connecting to an Emirates flight from any of our airports worldwide to Dubai."

We are looking at booking for August for a family of 3 - I’ve had an NHS year which showed negative and all you get is a text and an email - I’m told that this is sufficient proof that you don’t have Covid but it has to have been done in the last 96 hours of your arrival at the airport.My wife and I are also emergency workers and have been tested at work and both shown as positive meaning that we’ve had it at some point - whilst it’s inconclusive about being able to catch it again nobody has - but this isn’t acceptable for entry.It’s all a bit hard but 48 hours quarantine at a 5 star hotel for a couple of days doesn’t sound too bad!How much is the test at Dubai airport -‘somebody mentioned £70 each?
"Gary, according to this announcement, the test on arrival is free of charge.https:/…Scroll down it for the bit about touristsEdited: 2:34 pm, July 13, 2020 "
Is the £59 test guaranteed to get result back in 96 hours. The best I can see for a 72 hour timescale is £150 and even then its not guaranteed. That said unless the FCO guidelines change we won't be going
The testing done on arrival at Dubai Airport is free of charge...https://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/explai…
"Checked emirates site and as post 54 states it states the pcr test from those mentioned countries, does this mean of travelling from the U.K. you don’t need the test? Thanks"
"@ Anne - protocols haven't changed since post #1 as far as ex-UK, it's just that latest list of countries MUST have a negative PCR test to board. Emirates still has its own foibles on ex-UK, including anecdotal experiences (according to some recent Forum threads at least) of asking to see insurance at check-in.Worth looking at the FCO advice for UAE also (especially useful to sign up the email alerts too)https:/…united-arab-emiratesEdited: 11:55 am, July 14, 2020 "
When they say you need to show them proof of COVID test on arrival what sort of proof is acceptable? I was under the impression it was a certificate of a negative test not just an email of your result. It’s a bit of a grey area ! And an expensive one because those test are more costly than just having an email back. I’ve also be told today that if the FCO Still advise against travel to Dubai which apparently Is highly unlikely are flights will be cancelled anyway.
"With all due respect, I'd politely suggest ignoring that 'advice' on the last line.Nobody can ascertain likeliness of FCO advice changingIt's not necessarily true about the flight cancellations. It's likely airlines will cancel Dubai routings at present due to low demand rather than FCO advice.After all, FCO advice says not to travel and flights are still going - just to a smaller degree due to lower demand, and also things like impact on travel insurance, local protocols etc.As for 'grey areas' - the whole scenario of communications from Dubai isn't uniform and consistent. The protocols still have not changed, but either the reporting of them, or the communications, or interpretation of them has changed.I haven't seen anything which definitely states the format of what a negative PCR test will be acceptable anywhere. but that doesn't mean they won't say it's acceptable.At present, you don't need a PCR test result to board ex-UK, but you do have to sign declarations. Of course, that may all change"
I’m only going on what I’ve been told from our travel company that they flights won’t be cancelled. I have read and been told that you need a certificate of negative test as again can only go on information given. Lots of people are is this dilemma and there is no firm answers to these questions. Which is no help when deciding on making a decision of what to do for the best. I’m sure no one will want to pay for a test then to find out it’s not what they want.
"The travel agent is either guessing or don't know what they're on about or they have some other reason to say that. They don't know if the flights will be cancelled or not, only the airlines do.FCO advice has been in place since 23 Mar (I think). Flights still flew. Dubai 'opened for tourists' on 7th, without FCO advice changing - flights still flew. The number of flights is reducing (for reasons mentioned before) but it's a complete guess based on a false statement - ie they know the likeliness of the FCO advice changing.Let's try a different angle - right now, what would be your ideal outcome for travelling to Dubai? Would you rather have a cancellation, a refund, a rebook or go as planned?"
I’m happy to go if we could get some solid information on this test and of course the FCO allows. I think it makes it harder as we don’t have firm answers. I wouldn’t want to go without ticking all the boxes of what’s needed obviously. I think all we can hope for is some clear answers and fco lift travel ban which means we do have travel insurance.
"Most test results will be issued via email, including the NHS - one of the worlds largest national health care providers, therefore id bet my mortgage on an email will suffice (what i plan to take on August 1st). I doubt very much they'd want a gold plated framed certificate."
"Thanks Justine, that's helpful.Honestly, this certificate thing - I wouldn't worry too much about it. Worst case, print the email. There is no stipulation for a format so how could it be wrong, or right? Dubai can be erratic in its implementation and processes sometimes, so you just need to know the facts. You have all the appropriate links in this thread to support you. The issue about the FCO advice is it's not clear why it hasn't changed and they won't likely specify, which is why it's unreasonable for anyone to predict. I can only speak for what I know, and that's that the UAE was never on the original list for destinations likely to set up travel corridors.Emirates put a lot of PR out about speaking to the UK about a travel corridor, probably because they made bold predictions on flight demand getting being 'back to normal' over Summer months for the start of the season in Dubai.On top of that, media reports in the UK press 'suggested' possibly Dubai (note - some said Dubai, rather than UAE!) by 'end of August' but nobody seemed able to verify any sources or any foundation in statements.My guess - and it's a complete guess - is that I don't think the UK Gov could have a situation whereby it allowed a travel corridor whilst thousands of its citizens that are resident in Dubai are effectively trapped inside and outside of Dubai. Dubai doesn't seem too bothered about the bad optics of tourists coming back whilst hundreds of thousands of residents can't.I'd suggest with a high degree of confidence that you won't get any further clarity on the tests; it's not Switzerland or Germany we're talking about sadly - so one has to go with the protocols.The reason I asked your ideal outcome is that I would not recommend travelling until the FCO advice is lifted, so until then it's well worth going back to your agent (especially if it's a package as your rights are stronger) and request a refund based on the swathe of issues - FCO advice, insurance impact, significant changes in 'product' and value at hotels locally compared to what bought, etc.I'm just not a fan of waiting for a cancellation that may not come - if it does, fine but in the meantime, trying to get some clarity on the chance of a refund, rebook etc. may be some solace.As for the testing question, you don't need to show a certificate to travel. That doesn't mean you won't be asked, or there may some arbitrary change, or an update but I'd certainly explore the contingencies of a refund or other avenue before committing to testing at home.If you bought tests in UK, and even if you printed the results, it still doesn't mean you won't be tested at DXB on arrival or asked to quarantine, or cover medical costs should the worst happen.As for flight cancellation, there are flights being cancelled but equally many are still flying. so it's a crapshoot whether your booked flight may be one of the cancelled.Edited: 1:23 pm, July 14, 2020 "
Thank you for your help & advice advice.
Thankyou
"I did read that although Dubai has opened its doors to tourists, not all emirates have. As Dubai is not a country, i believe the FCO will wait until all emirates are open before adding to the travel corridor list."
"Hello, yes it's mentioned very clearly that you have to use the COVID19-DXB app. As mentioned, it does not work for foreign numbers, and I arrive Fridat 17th. This is the message received after contacting the Dubai Health Authority : ""Thank you for contacting Dubai Health Authority.The app only accepts UAE mobile numbers and therefore, you will need to arrive to the UAE and then you will be able to get a number upon arrival and then login to the application.We hope this addresses your concern.""Anybody experienced it? Did you reiceve a SIM on arrival?Thanks,Ana"
"Ana - some have been lucky enough to be given a SIM (anecdotal evidence based on TA posts) but you can always buy a tourist SIM, or when you complete the forms use your own number & they can SMS you results.Of course, a local SIM is preferable for many reasons."
"6 of us due to go in 3 weeks, would prefer test before but at £150 each !But cannot risk test on arrival and one of us testing positive and we all have to quarantine for 2 weeks.Totally pointless going but company will not refund."
"@ BLR - why will the company not refund? Have they cancelled? Are you booked on a package?With the proviso that I don't know your circumstances or what discussions you've had with them, there's often is always a way to get a result if the facts are in your favour. Just saying this because a large part of the issues faced with agents and companies is either not speaking to the right person or the right approach so if there's anyway we could help, just holler - don't give up just yet!"
@shaun C thanks for reply.They are basically saying credit note only or change till next year.I’ve booked club rooms at JBH which they’re now Not offering and also exec pool closed only open wkds. So all club benefits are not happening.I’ve asked for a refund twice now and they are not replying to my recent emails I’m due to travel the 5th.
"@ BLR - if it's booked as a package, and they've notified you of cancellations you have a right to be refunded with 14 days under PTR 2018. They can say what they want, but doesn't mean they are correct.Which company is it? I guess it comes down to two things - IF they notified you of cancellation, and speaking the right person the right way. IF they didn't notify of cancellation and the flights are still flying, you're probably in the realms of requesting a refund based on a range of issues (e.g. FCO advice, signficant changes, insurance impacts, prototocls etc.)"

"@ Wayne - thanks for the kind words, always appreciated and good to know they're some help.Q - have you written a letter to Crawley or communicated with Siobhan Fitzpatrick about this?Unfortunately, the agents are in such a tiss at present even previously good providers and companies are struggling, as it's a very difficult situation to get a handle on.In most cases, there's a cancellation on a package holiday and the issue is either speaking to the right person or getting the right priority or getting it actioned expediently.In your case, IF there's not a cancellation then it's likely you'd be looking for a goodwill gesture ultimately, or at the very least, a service recovery, and the front-line staff of most companies aren't usually authorised to acton this as it's the domain of the Executive team.So for you, it's likely you'd have to 'build a case' along with a few facts. This is why I always ask what's the objective/ideal outcome because that then determines the response. If it's a refund, then you need to 'strike when the iron is hot' based on the situation now, rather than what may be.Right now, the FCO advice says not to travel, and that you need medical insurance, and that you need PCR test before travel (ignore the issue of whether you do or what the protocols say). On top of that, without a doubt, the hotel you've booked is not as per the brochure. Additionally, depending on your carrier, you're at risk of schedule changes or cancellations (another thread has just posted that Emirates apparently have cancelled one flight from Dubai through to November)So, the good news is that it's easy to build a case, but as it's likely to be discretionary you may not automatically be entitled to an outright refund (but of course that's what you ask for to start with) but may end up with vouchers or a rebooking?My view would be a pleasant, polite but firm request for a refund to the Executive Team/CEO (who I *think* is SF or it may still be Joe Thompson) listing your reasons briefly and clearly. Also worth adding that it's a one-off because you've been such a loyal customer but it's not normal times, blah blah and simply too much a financial and health risk to go against FCO advice with no insurance to a country with big healthcare costs that's currently offering vastly reduced services.PS, Which hotel were you looking to be staying at?PPS. Homework time - get on the FCO page and screenshot the page as it is that says you need health insurance, such as this screenshothttps://d.pr/i/SWk2YpEdited: 3:10 pm, July 16, 2020 "
"Right, where to start...One liner is - DO NOT cancel of your own accord; why should you - your strategy should be to get Virgin to offer you a discretionary refund (ideal, unlikely) or rebook/vouchers, and the key to that is using data to prove your case. Contact - without a doubt, your best option right now is to write 'old school' to the top - you will definitely get a response at least that way. I would be tempted to write in the style of ""look, we're good customers but we're really concerned that our holiday won't be anything like as planned because of a, b, c, d, e etc. and we don't want to be disadvantaged in any way by choosing to cancel nor having a 'disinclination to travel' - what can you do about it? We'd like a refund (start off with the biggest ask).Hotel - I would contact the hotel directly and ask them to include you on updates regarding their operations and restrictions. Most of the decent hotels are communicating similarly in terms of operational restrictions (e.g. rooms, dining, pools, rules etc.) I would also ask to speak to a Guest Relations Manager or Front Office/Desk Manager to confirm exactly what measures and restrictions are available on the day you write to Virgin. Be aware that there are measures adopted by the regulations but also some hotels are reducing facilities for operational reasons, cost-cutting etc. under the 'cover' of COVID. For obvious reasons, many properties are not publicly communicating about restrictions and operational cuts, which is why you need to speak directly.Whilst this is main hotel update page for COVID, almost certainly there will be other restrictions (e.g. in-room, mini bar, towels, sheet-changing or similar maybe)https:/…alertsBackground - sadly, this is the scenario with agents and package providers. Schedule changes, cancellations etc. are all tied up in the conditions sadly - fact of life. As for why they wouldn't proactively cancel, well it's not in their interests to do so and on the whole, they don't have to - they're middlemen, and like most middlemen, won't raise their head about the parapet.Insurance - it's a bit of a stab in the dark, but I'd be very doubtful a general travel insurance would cover all the separate issues that could be brought into the mix - against FCO advice, Dubai protocols, known event of COVID etc. so I would double-check everything, especially if it's either a 'normal' policy or one purchased since COVID came to light. It may be there is some cover for some things, but travel curtailment, on-cost/expenses should medical care be needed in Dubai (inc up-front downpayment), FCO advice not changing etc.Arrival - you can register on the declaration form a contact number with UK number if needed, that's how they will send you results. You may either be given a local tourist SIM or be able to get one to register with the app (a local SIM is always a smart move should you be using data such as with Entertainer, apps etc.) or they may update the app to include international numbers. God alone knows what's going on presently with so many tourists supposedly needing to register but being unable to do so.Newcastle routing - don't listen to rumours; check data - it doesn't lie. On your date, EK are currently showing routings NCL to DXB either via Kings Cross/LHR or KLM to Amsterdam; that doesn't mean that's the route they will offer you though. As it stands right now, they are showing availability direct on 1st Sep but they were also supposedly direct from 01 Aug, so maybe that could change in time to go the way of the August re-routings.Booking - The holiday can still go ahead despite all the interruptions, hence they will still sell it because they can sit back knowing the conditions (which many don't read/understand) allows them to put the responsibilities onto the carrier, hotel or customer.Hope this helps.!"
"@waynet There is still a long while off before your holiday. I appreciate you feel frustrated but there are 1000s or other people in the same boat, I myself have refunds still due from various travel companies. In fact we had booked to go to Vegas in Sept with Virgin and because the flight changed from a different airport Virgin contacted me to say I could have a voucher or a refund, simple online form to complete no bother and just wait for the Refund (120 days)My understanding is If within 14 days of departure the FCO advice is still do not travel you will be offered a refund. You will most likely have to wait for it though. I think we all have to take a step back and realised these are very unprecedented times and the travel operators are dealing with thousands of holidays, not just ours, although it can be hard to think like that sometimes when we have all forked out our hard earned cash. I have also given up reading the news because they just dramatise everything and half of it is rubbish!Keep calm everyone and let’s remember as long as we stay healthy that’s the main thing x"
"Wayne may not entitiled to a refund under the regs, unless the flight (or another element) is cancelled.FCO advising against travel is not a direct correlation to a refund, ie there won't automatically be a refund. If an airline chooses not to fly for operational reasons, demand etc. and thus cancels the flight then a refund is within rights.The reason I'm suggesting he writes now is not because of 'pushing in' front of the more urgent cases or 'not waiting'. it's just because his situation is such that he may not be entitled a refund so may as well try to get an offer on the table of a rebook or another concession. At least then knowing that he can see what happens over the next few weeks.Additionally, the people dealing with refunds and enquiries are not of the appropriate seniority to make the discretionary goodwill gesture he may need to allow a rebook on the merits of his concerns/complaint.Situation to avoid is losing the advantage of having FCO advice in his favour, should it change in the coming weeks.Edited: 5:23 am, July 17, 2020 "
September is a long way off - why don’t you give it a couple more weeks and see how it all plays out? I think there is still a fair amount of water to flow under the bridge...I would ask for written confirmation from your insurers that you are covered if FCO advise is still essential travel only.
"Hi Wayne, if you booked a package with Virgin Holidays it sets out in their booking conditions your rights under the package travel regulations 2018.It states that you can terminate your contract and get a full refund if there is a significant change and it confirms that a change of UK departure airport is classed as significant.It also states that you may terminate your contract if there are exceptional circumstances and confirms that changes occurring because of FCO recommendation is considered such.https://www.virginholidays.co.uk/important/terms-and-conditionsThe CMA sent an open letter to the travel industry last week reminding them of their obligations to comply with consumer law. I'm not suggesting that Virgin have fallen short but you should be hearing from them soon and they should set out all your options.I am due to travel in October so just monitoring the situation at present to see what happens and will make a decision nearer the time. Good luck"
"Insurance isn't really my bag, but AFAIA insurance can cover for COVID-related stuff BUT there may be an overarching policy point of clause whereby travelling against FCO advice either negates or negatively impacts. At the end of the day, it looks like whichever outcome prevails you're in the same boat for now - sit and wait. If you have the fallback of knowing you can rebook, then there's nothing to be gained speaking with VH as I mentioned previously (as you'd likely still end up with the same result, rather than an outright refund). However, at least you'd have reassurance of having something in your 'back pocket' should things change.As for Emirates - they may have cancelled the route in Mar, but for all intents and purposes it was until 01 Aug 20. Since then, if they've been amending the actual flights they may not necessarily be classed as 'cancelled' as they're still showing available (see previous posts). This is why I don't feel you will be automativally triggered for a refund unless it's a categoric cancellation.https:/… Anyways, seems you have it covered - no pun intended - but double, triple check the insurance about FCO advice."
"Thanks Shaun, I think the CMA letter will make a big difference, we can't be fobbed off as easily now!"
"While waiting for the results, did u go to your point of destination or did u have to stay somewhere’safe’! We are flying on the 24th of July and we don’t know whether we should book transfers yet!!"
"Tiger66We’re due to fly on the 25th Have you got valid travel insurance this is what I’m struggling withEdited: 4:18 pm, July 17, 2020 "
"The wording of your policy seems pretty standard. I wouldn't worry about ""...will be considered"" as insurers need to validate claims before paying out. It would appear that your policy does not cover you for travelling to a country where the FCO advise against travel but it would cover you for cancellation due to Covid (usually within 31 days of departure date). If the FCO advise changes favourably then your policy should provide you with full cover, including covid. I am in a similar position with my policy having booked my holiday pre covid I am fully covered but not for travelling against FCO advice. So hoping the advice will change before October.Please check your wording carefully though as I am no expert and all policies are different."

"I'm off to Dubai on the 28th July, I'm just going to book myself in for the NHS test on Friday this week which should then be sufficient when/ if asked to show the test result upon arrival at Dubai Airport"
"On the upside, the last 'booze ban' has been somewhat eased also - bars can be reopen - along with shisha now being permitted at licensed venus."
Really good thoughts and advice on this topic . Thank you .
"Is not 100% true >>> "" Unless the FCO remove Dubai from the list of ‘non essential travel’ ........ then NO insurance policys are valid"" As of course, it depends on factors such as what the policy is for & the exclusions, but for a very, very high % of cases, it will be correct to say FCO advise negates cover.The big 'red flag' I'd suggest is that the FCO advice for Brit Nationals is to have medical insurance (ignore the 'wriggle room' on the Dubai protocols that say you can sign a waiver), yet travelling against FCO advice will likely negate said policy.Yes, a traveller could show that £ 2.99 travel insurance policy they got via Compare the Market to get Meerkat Movies, but should one be unfortunate to be taken ill the first thing they're going to want to see if your credit card for a hefty authorisation should you need medical care.Please, be careful and do the thing many don't want to - research objectively, get facts and make an objective, informed decision."
"The thing is, there's now a 'niche' for marketing insurance that folk will thnk covers COVID (and it may do).Even ABTA's getting in on the game with their Travel Sure policy, launched a couple of days back. Note though, the word 'FCO' doesn't feature apart from in an ad on the article page...https:/…As Lady Loupina suggests, it's all about clarification on the wording of any policy and most insurers/agents rely on customers not checking for themselves (similar to car hire companies)"
"Cheers @Shaun C you are a legend.All, I will get onto them tomorrow for clarification, watch this space. Also not seeing much on Jumeirah area on social media as this is where we are staying, seems strange.."
"If you have an NHS test they just send you a text message, which doesn’t contain your name, saying if you are negative or positive. I can’t see this being accepted as proof at DXB? I’d assume you need an actual certificate with your name on it. Can anyone confirm?Edited: 12:37 pm, July 19, 2020 "
"@ Lady L; thanks again. Just trying to do a bit.Jumeirah BH had some jiggerpokery going on over past couple of months, pretending it wasn’t closed so that was a bit weird.Not sure about Portugal but shows how fast things can change hey? FWIW my two pence worth is that perhaps the resident approvals is a factor in the advice, along with UAE not being on the original ‘wish list’ of destinations to hopefully open up. Summer tourist number ex-UK are small comparatively.When are you looking to head over? Good luck with speaking to the insurers. Pray for clarity."
Total mess. They should either open the border or keep it closed. COVID -19 is the biggest fake of 2020.Soon they will feel it when ppl stop going there ..
You also get an email You can print out.
I have insurance with my bank would this be valid? Also were you allowed out of the airport whilst you were waiting for the results? Would you advise to get a test before I travel in UK ?Cheers
"@ Julie - it depends on what your policy says, it can't be answered with a simple yes/no on a forum without knowing specifics. There are a few threads already on the Dubai Forum over past week or so with a high volume of good info about insurance, exclusions etc. that may help you.You don't have to wait at the airport for the test, as has been said earlier in this thread and also in the protocols listed several times.It would certainly be advisable to have a test before travel, if only for peace of mind and to identify any issues as you could be signing up for big costs otherwise, especially if insurance is negated by travelling contrary to FCO advice"
"Quick check of VH's T&C shows >>>https:/…terms-and-conditionsa. A change of resort area for the whole or a major part of your holiday,b. A change of accommodation to that of a lower official classification for the whole or a major part of your holiday,c. A change of UK departure airport (excluding change of London Airports),d. A change of outward departure time or overall length of your holiday of twelve or more hours.and9.2. You can cancel your booking without paying cancellation charges if the performance of your package, or the carriage of passengers to your destination, is significantly affected by unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances. In such circumstances, we will arrange for your booking to be terminated and for you to receive a full refund. We will observe advice provided by the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office.---So does that time (ie - 'd' above) class as a significant change? As I read it (beer in hand so maybe wrong/blurry) it's only a couple of hours on the departure time, so possibly no chance of reparation there I'd say. However, double-check the overall change in time of your holiday to see if it's more than 12 hours maybe?Note they also say about recognising FCO advice. Again, it all comes down to what you're looking to do"
Are you travelling from the UK as there are many places you can get tested around the country FOC. They will then text and email you the certificate which you are to print and take with you within 48 hours of the test. The test must be up to 4 days before you whether Dubai.
It’s really not. The NHS had walk in clinics for free. That’s what everyone travelling to Dubai is doing.
They want you to print the NHS email. They charge £6 for printing at Dubai airport!
"This is what our travel insurance with our bank First Direct says:If I travel to a country where the FCO has advised against all or all but essential travel, will that invalidate my travel insurance?We urge you to follow the advice outlined by the FCO and local authorities and not to place yourself at additional risk. However, if you decide to travel against the FCO advice, you will still be covered for medical emergency claims. You will not be covered under your policy for abandonment if the travel advice was in place when you left the UK because coronavirus is now a known event.If I contract coronavirus while I'm on a trip, will I be covered for medical treatment outside the UK?Yes, you would be covered. However, you should be aware that treatment is subject to the locally available facilities. Medical repatriation or transfer to alternative medical facilities would be subject to any travel restrictions.It sounds like we would be covered."
"Hi, you mention that Dubai are accepting the NHS email (printed) our as proof of negative test. This surprises me as there is no date on the email that confirms what date the test was taken?"

"It's an official announcement from Dubai - you're meant to be confused, it's par for the course these days in Dubai. Best to let the dust settle for a couple of days and see what the FCO says, as past experience shows these annoucements are often contradictory or later clarified.The worst thing is, they tend to announce them as the weekend is starting locally so it's often left hanging until Sunday before.a clarification is issued.There has been an annoucement via WAM (official news agency) and just now, an NCEMA post on Twitter in Arabic. Let's see what develops, but worst case it may be that the PCR test they said you should have (but could have had on arrival) is now mandatory for boarding."
It’s confusing as gulf news saying all tourists and residents will be tested On arrival at any uae airports but residents travelling out of uae need pcr certificates if travelling to certain countries.

"One of the entry requirements for Dubai is International Health Insurance, is this right? Do you have to have proof when you get into Dubai Airport?"
"@ Liz - it depends where you're flying from, who you're flying with etc. For instance, in some cases, ex-UK Emirates have been known to check for insurance at check-in.Although the protocols do have a bit of 'wriggle room' they do say you should have insurance, and if anything, they're only likely to tighten up as time goes on.Emirates announced a form of insurance cover with flights today also (see other threads on here) although it does have exclusions if your government advice is against non-essential travel."
"As of 1st August, traveling into Dubai as a final destination or connecting you MUST have a COVID Test 4 days prior to flight. My Question, for UK travelers, is that, the NHS provide a result via Text Message (As far as I am aware). Do the NHS offer anything in writing / printable. Otherwise I need to look for a Private Medical Test, which is fine, £100 +/- is nothing for peace of mind for a non-distributed journey. Anyone know more on the NHS options for test results? PS - The Emirates Website is very clear and helpful;https:/…"
I don’t think the Emirates update is very clearFirst it says without a negative test result you can’t board the flightThen it says you can be tested on arrival (unless you are from one of the listed countries which doesn’t include the UK)So which is it?
"Also, the bit about needing travel insurance or having to sign a waiver doesn’t make sense given Emirates say they are offering such insurance"
I have friends and family who have travelled from the UK in the past week to Dubai. The NHS test also emails you- this should be printed and shown at check in
I also don't think the emirates update is very clear.It appears to me to be contradictory as per Travelbear's post.Hopefully it will all become clearer over the next few days.
Travelling Sept 29th. Usual flight changes re Manchester Emirates as expected. Would love clarification if NHS text result suffices?
"@ Jamie - "" Would love clarification"" wouldn't we all? Not just on this, but any 'communication' ex-Dubai would be good also. The root cause of the issue is that the initial comms are not clear to start with, then they get 'interpreted', or in the case of Emirates's latest release, put into Google Translate and mangled so it sounds like ""Charley Says"" by The Prodigy. Seems like the intern had a go at 'updating' their previous release from the 16th and had to hit a word count.Leave it for a few days, see what Dubai says in the media when they get back to work tomorrow and also, the first port of call should always be the FCO's advice page. Hopefully, their update on 27th may even be a little more good news.Edited: 6:25 am, July 24, 2020 "
I have called Emirates twice now. And both times say nhs tests would be OK. As I cant travel to London or Manchester just for a test
Thanks Shaun - have read all of your replies. Appreciate the ongoing updates and advice!
Transit pax also need mandatory covid test now:https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/co…https:/…
"Hi All,It’s been a while since my last post apologies for that, we have just decided to move our holiday to the 1st August. We were due to fly tomorrow from Manchester at 14:00 to DXB and we are now going hopefully wait until Monday as there may be a possibility of of UAE been added to the FCO list.@Shaun C in a previous post I mentioned I could get travel insurance with COVID-19 cover, however I have had confirmation that it will be void if its not on the list of approved travel on country’s to travel.So fingers crossed for Monday, if there is still no change we will cancel for 2020 ☹️"
"Thanks @Shaun C, and yes are per Bronia message we will need a negative test 96 hours before travel.Does anyone know is 96 hours as you board the plane, or 96 hours as we land at DXB?"
it appears this transit business has gone from emirates website
Change that has now reappeared in a different way

You can buy travel insurance which covers you against fco advise.
"We didn’t! Flew from Heathrow on 24th!! They took details and gave us a test at the airport!! We are now in hotel room waiting for results before we are allowed out!! It’s been 14 hours now, hopefully not much longer"
Could you let me know what you were required to show at check in and then on arrival at Dubai? Do you have travel insurance?
Tiger66ni - Do you have to stay in your hotel room or are you allowed to go to the pool for example?
Flying on Emirates - free COVID19 Cover anywhere....https:/…
Not if you’re travelling against your governments advice!

"@ Sherpa - which is your home country, and are you travelling from there to the UAE?This latest announcement was made on Thursday, then later another briefing clarified (read - changed) and it's only today when the media are trying to make sense out of it.

Hi ShaunThanks- i am from from Uk
I’ve been. Looking at bupa £65 each can book online for next day
"Folks - read the other thread please, check all the links and articles there, especially about approved tests.It could be that BUPA tests are acceptable, but bear in mind the risk of information change and IF it's only from approved centres, that test *could* be worthless."
Shaun please post link to other thread. Thanks
Doggle - I quickly checked the bupa tests for £65 which are antibody tests and usually much cheaper than the required PCR test.
"Ps. On the fabled other thread, someone is reporting feedback from Emirates Executive Office that an NHS test would be acceptable (for now) but also said to keep checking, as things are changing fast.https:/…107389524"
Does anyone know if the nhs test would be fine ? I don’t wanna be spending extra money for a private tbh
"On what grounds would you qualify for an NHS test?Don’t you have to have symptoms, live with someone with symptoms or be a key worker?"
Nope! It’s free for uk people
"Direct quote from https:/…coronavirus-disease-covid-19“COVID-19 testing for the purposes of international travel is not available on the NHS.”—Quote from https:/…“ Who can get a testYou can get a test:for yourself, if you have coronavirus symptoms now (a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste)for someone you live with, if they have symptomsif you live in England and have been told to have a test before you go into hospital, for example, for surgeryif you live in any of these local councils where there are coronavirus outbreaks: Leicester, Luton, Pendle, or Blackburn with DarwenThis service is for people in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.”"
"# 168 there’s no charge for an NHS text but only if you meet the criteria Shaun has listedSurely if you claim to meet this criteria in order to get tested, ie by claiming to have symptoms or having been exposed to the virus, then you leave yourself exposed for other questionnaires etc that you’ll no doubt have to complete, asking if you’ve had symptoms or been exposed to the virusI think if you want to travel to Dubai you just need to suck up the cost of a private test"
"Good point travelbear.The health declaration has to be completed and handed in at check in which asks if you have had any symptoms within the last three days. It also asks if you have been in contact with anyone with who has been diagnosed with covid in the last 14 days. Also, in the event of a claim your insurance company may challenge why you went on holiday if you had symptoms.Catch 22, you need to be symptomatic to be entitled to a free NHS test but should you really be going on holiday with symptoms?"
If it was just myself travelling I would pay for the private test but as there are 5 of us all over 12 years of age then a private test will cost us £700! And these changes have not been budgeted in our travel plans. And then the cost for another test in Dubai. Came across this article as we do not have clinic near us as the ones listed are 2.5 hours away and it does state emirates will accept a local government test. https://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/co… Also you can select ‘other’ reason when doing the nhs test and Not state you have any symptoms. For now will be leaving it till Friday see if there are any fco updates if not will then see if I can get a full refund from Netflights.

"Folks - just a tip.Don't wait to know about refunds - it's far wiser to get the facts & options from your agent or provider BEFORE you make a decision. If you cancel yourself, you potentially lose rights for a refund as it could be interpreted as 'disinclination to travel'.Yes, the costs are expensive but after all, if you choose to travel against FCO (which should be your main concern IMO) then you should pony up for proper tests and not take risks with NHS tests,Regard to the list of centres from The National - it may be worth checking the actual web link rather than an old article (that hasn't been updated) as since the article was published, the app has added labs from other operators - at least 3 other companies - and likely there may be one closer to Brum than Warrington or Bristol Even if there isn't, Birchwood's only about 80 miles / 1hr and half from Brum..Edited: 3:40 am, July 28, 2020 "
"L a dxb, aside from the cost of the tests here, the only link I could find to a place to get a test in Dubai (Kings College Hospital) has them listed as being 670 AED which will very soon add up for 5 of youIt also mentions that the 300 AED (which I think this is for the doctors services) is on a cash basis - it wasn’t clear to me if that applied to the 370 for the actual test too"
"@l a dxb, I do sympathise with your predicament, the cost is just going to be prohibitive for some, especially families with children. I have mixed feeling really, on the one hand I am happy pay for the tests as it will make me feel much safer on the flights ( but we are only two adults) and on the other, the costs are just adding up and I am not very happy to take time out of my six day holiday to visit a clinic together with all the risks and uncertainties involved with the ever changing rules and regulations.I think people may just be be put off travelling to Dubai alltogether regardless of FCO advice."
"I don’t think you CAN get a private test in the UK, can you?"
From sources i have read you can get a test using https://screening.purehealth.ae/ there are several labs dotted around the UK
*I think people may just be be put off travelling to Dubai alltogether regardless of FCO advice.*Totally agree with thisThe requirement for a test before your return flight has sealed it for us - we won’t be goingToo many unknowns What on earth do you do if one of your party tests positive but the rest don’t............
"@Travelbear #176and what would these 'other questionnaires' be? Nobody, from what iv read so far has mentioned additional questionnaires if you have an NHS test. I doubt Dubai airport will question anyone with a negative test result just because you had in at an NHS testing site. You could easily have a high temp, eat a bland meal, have a stuffy nose etc etc, to gain a test, yet be covid-free.Edited: 6:33 am, July 28, 2020 "

I have spoken to Emirates who confirmed an NHS print out was fine and that the approved centres were only for the countries listed. UK is not one.

The NHS IS the government!!
How on earth can the NHS not be accredited by the government when they are a government body? Hence why they told me it would be fine.

"I’m supposed to be flying from Glasgow next Wednesday (5 Aug). I’m going to visit Glasgow Airport on Saturday (1st August) and check that an NHS text / email will be accepted. I called emirates this morning and they said yes, but I’d rather have it confirmed by the airport staff. I will report back."
Thank you
Problem is the rules are set to change again from 1st August where you will have to have a negative test cert from a recommended uk clinic and also be tested in UAE before you board the plane to return to uk this putting hundreds possibly thousands of pounds on people’s holidays if the party is large. I’m sooo hacked off with it all tbh it’s a nightmare xx

"Hi, Sorry - just wanted to double check - NHS tests even from 1st August will be allowed to enter Dubai? And on leaving Dubai, do you know where to get a test before and how much it will cost?Are you still going on your trip?Many thanks"
"@ Lianna - I don't wish to 'take the jam out of your doughnut' but that Emirates 'advice' may have been superseded. Not saying it was wrong, just that there appears to be a distinct push towards using the approved (Pure Health) centres. One can only wonder why (but cash to the UAE may be a factor)Yes, people have done great work trying to help by speaking with Emirates, but Emirates may also be wrong on this. I'm happy to say, I may be wrong too and the advice about Pure Health may be overkill, but if people are intent on gambling then it's the best bet.@ Wayne - keep drinking the Kool Aid. Hope you're well and reassured now your panic is over (for now at least!) take care!"
You make a lot of sense. This is way too stressful Will wait for them to cancel me or I will just change the datesStressing this much is not worth it
"‘the NHS will not provide a test if you are going on holiday so the only way you can one with them is by lying and that’s not morally right.’Not only is it morally wrong, you trip yourself up straight away as you’d have to lie and say you have symptoms / exposure to the virus in order to get an NHS test then, just a few days later sign forms and declarations for airlines and hotels etc saying you are symptom / contact free I can’t see that ending well in the event of an incident whilst away"
"How much is the Covid PCR test at the Dubai Airport? You need to wait the result at the airport or you can go to the hotel and wait there for the result? Emirates has a Covid insurance that will cover 150k euros if you get positive result until 30 days after departing day, anyone received this insurance confirmation from emirates to show at the arrival?"
"@ Jessica - are you in the UK? Did you check the centres via the Pure Health app?Thanks for sharing your feedback about Emirates saying NHS won’t suffice. It shows the situation is ever-changing and it’s awful that you’re in this position.If you can’t find anywhere to do a test before next Weds, I guess there’s a few ‘clutch at straws’ options1) go back to any centre and ask if there’s an expedited or premium option - to use local parlance, a VVIP option. It may cost more of course but sometimes money (or cakes) talks.2) if you could get proof that the timescale of announcement shows no approved centres have availability,, and you show evidence of other family flights (especially with same carrier) there may be a chance the airline could make a discretionary goodwill gesture especially if you show NHS rest. It may not be an acceptable test to them, but at least it shows good faith and you are trying.3) The safest advice is not to try to travel, but that’s unrealistic given the circumstances. So I’d cover my bets and perhaps try contacting the Executive Office/CEO of the airline to see if what they advise.It’s all about exploring every option in what is clearly a challenging and stressful situation, and best of luck"
"@ Lady L - sorry to hear of your situation, and I hope it works out for you another time.Under the present situation, IMO choosing to go to Dubai is akin to leaving the house knowing someone else has your only key.@ Dar from SP - please read back in the this and the other PCR departure thread: all the answers are there already.You need to read back, research and understand how volatile the situation Is with things changing quickly and lots of uncertainty.Note - that Emirates ‘insurance’ is a risk in itself, as they’ve changed the terms and conditions twice already.Edited: 12:54 am, July 29, 2020 "
Hi All. Are children under 12 being tested upon arrival in Dubai?
Ignore... Seems the answer is no.

No they are not
"I am flying to Dubai next week from London and have just booked my PCR test with Randox which is a Pure Health partner. You will need to book via the Pure Health website and then give the clinic a call to book in a date and time for the test - they will ask for your Pure Health application number which you will get upon payment at this link: https://screening.purehealth.ae/applicationRandox have said they provide results in 24-48 hours and their process is designed in a way to ensure you get your results before you fly out.My test is on Tuesday.Cost is £115Edited: 7:00 am, July 29, 2020 "
Well a bit more bad news for ya today. Hubby has had an email from his employers stating that if we travel against FCO recomnendatuon and have to isolate on return then he will not be paid or able to take it as holiday and he will face disiplinary action. It just gets worse day by day. Do check with your employers everyone xx
"I stopped by Glasgow Airport today and spoke to the Emirates check in staff. I asked if an NHS test was acceptable when departing to Dubai and I was told yes, I asked if was 100% sure as I have had conflicting information. She then phoned her manager and came back and confirmed that the NHS test is NOT acceptable and you MUST go through Pure Health."
If the UAE required specific test centers to be used for UK travelers then surely they'd be on the 'designated lab' list as they are for many many other countries. This is the most confusing aspect of it.
"One member of Emirates staff accepting an NHS result, but their manager saying no!! Farcical. Personally i wouldn't just automatically believe 'the manager' knew for sure either."
"I think the best thing to do if you are travelling from the UK is to get a test done by one of the clinics that are approved by Pure Health. By doing this, you are on the safe side and there are no doubts to whether or not it would be valid.@Shaun, would you agree?"
"I am returning to Brisbane on 14 th August one way via Dubai transit airside for a couple of hours with Emirates, and have spent the last 12 hrs getting conflicting information from Emirates and the FCO Emirates via telephone conversation and another call back said NHS PCR is ok but it’s not as my niece is Doctor and they only issue an email or text. I don’t believe the email will be sufficient official confirmation and Pure Health will be the way to go for me as it’s stated on UAE website as their approved laboratory Only trouble when you go to the booking for Pure Health it asks for visitor visa and as I am only airside will not be needing a visitor visa or have I read this wrong I will be checking in every day with FCO as this is the best source for current information I hope!'!!!!!!!!!!!"
"@ Haroon it’s not just the wise move, it’s the only way. At least until the advice changes.@ Lollipop - there will always be conflicting advice it seems these dats, but if can be reduced by either filtering out who to listen to & and also waiting a bit for a uniform message. It took the UAE since Thu to confirm about approved tests so that’s why FCO only updated yesterday.Note - there were quite a lot of resident-approved labs in Oz from The National article I posted earlier in thread (or maybe it was on the other thread - PCR pre departure test). The resident- approved labs are also the same ones Pure Health are coordinating with. Im not sure but I think they differentiate between visit visa and resident just because there are extra steps for resident ref approvals. If you’re transit, select visit to get the labs. Check with Pure Health though.The advice is clear - try Pure Health and only if there’s none in-country speak to your carrier then for guidance.Edited: 12:29 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"If you go through the pure health website it has many U.K. based test centres approved by the UAE. You just pick your nearest one, pay the fee (£120) and then contact the centre to book your test."
"@ HaroonI agree get your test done in the UK via Pure health, NHS email regardless the Emirates call centre advice for Dubai is not probably at this stage going to get you past the UK check in , unless the CEO ofEmirates states otherwise!"
@ Lolly - apologies I'd misread it thought you were heading out from Oz. Fingers crossed it all works out for you
I have an email from Emirates saying an electronic NHS test will suffice. I can’t share on here as it’s a screen shot of an email they have sent me.
"@ MFSX - you need to be aware that since yesterday when you mentioned this, things have changed. Not saying you're wrong, or they were then, but is it really worth missing the plane for when you know now that it's not correct? You may get lucky of course, or you may not. Entirely your call.The rules could not be clearer now - you need to go via Pure Health approved centres, IF there are none in your country (which there are) THEN you speak to your carrier. You spoke to the carrier BEFORE this was confirmed as the current case."
"I have an email from them today, in writing."
"Very good. As I said, maybe you will get lucky. However, the balance of these latest threads, the media and the FCO seems to suggest the volatility of the situation may be a tad risky. Another poster a few lines back was also told NHS test was okay. Then was advised it wasn't.We're only trying to help here. Look, you could try that and it could work - wonderful for you, which proves how erratic the advice is, no? So, are you going to risk it?Edited: 4:22 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"mfsx7nm3, please do share their email :) Ive also contacted several times, on the phone and live chat and each time they have said an NHS test will be ok (only for the UK). But who knows, maybe their customer support haven't been told that all tests should be through pure health?"
I will post it on my Twitter @nadiasms
Surely something in writing is binding and will be honoured?
"Not if the rules have been updated, or the advice given you was incorrect or has since been superseded. It’s like having a betting slip for Shergar to win the Grand National.Nobody is saying it won’t work, but the rules have changed. It may be down to Emirates on the day to decide, but what will you do?Suppose you followed up again with EK and they say yes (or even no) - would you still stick with an NHS test when you know they’re now not approved by Pure Health?The issue here isn’t whether the advice is right or wrong, it’s the risk in proceeding with a test you know has a risk of not being accepted. Is it worth it?Edited: 4:43 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"There is another potential confusion/concern about taking advice from Emirates.Their COVID advice page has a link for ‘approved labs’ but that directs to their own lIst not the UAE government approved process (ie vie Pure Health). Either EK are updating this list over time, or they will update link to Pure Health or maybe this list is for the ‘double test countries’.Who knows? I don’t - but it does show EK’s advice is a bit higgledy-piggleldy and there are risks as it’s not aligned with the FCO advice, which is aligned with the latest media updates also."
"ShaunA chum of mine runs a very successful U.K. based air cargo consultancy business, and he does load plans for special freight, unusual cargo contents, cargo hold adaptations for the carriage of livestock, best use of the EK Skycargo fleet, etc, and for a number of other airlines, including EK, Delta, Qatar DHL Cargo planes, , VS, and others.He’s had a long and happy relationship with EK for many years..He is due to fly to Dubai in mid August from the U.K. for an assignment with EK.Last week he got his Assignment Pack, and as he’s travelling at EK’s expense, and will be working for them , he’s been told he can only get his pre-departure COVID19 test from a company called “ Eurofins”... I have no reason to doubt him, but, as he’s also flown EK in a private, leisure capacity, it does make you wonder who is deciding and co-ordinating what EK are putting out...What people need is one message, coming from one, official, authoritative source, and as we all know, in the UAE, that’s like asking for the moon to turn electric blue with pink tinsel around it... it’s not going to happen."
"@ Wotsit - they are one if the 3 UK companies approved via Pure Health.The official update yesterday was from NCEMA spokesman and was clear - Pure Health approved labs in your country. If it’s not from a PH approved clinic then no more than 72 hours. There was some comment about a discussions with airline & “local market authority’ but that’s if no approved labs. And the NHS isn’t.The real risk here is what degree of chance folk are willing to risk. It could come down to the vagaries of a check-in clerk, rather than what’s correct or not. There is a lack of clarity, and there likely will continue to be. I just hope folk look into the detail objectively and then it’s a personal decision what’s an acceptable risk.Edited: 5:56 pm, July 29, 2020 "
Same issue here. Travel on 8 Aug. But no lab here in NJ /NY area is committing to provide results within 96 hours. The turnaround time is 7-10 days.
"Eurofins are UAE approved, they have a clinic in Glasgow and that’s who Pure Health have referred me to for my test."
"hi, we are on the same boat. Does that mean Emirates will not let us board the plane?"
"@ Tanzina - potentially, yes. The 'rules' are that approved labs are needed to get a negative PCR test certificate for boarding.Whether the airlines accept other tests/labs and which tests (other than Pure Health) are approved could be the pinch points.The added confusing factor from EK is their 'list' of approved labs' link is different than the Pure Health approved list (which is the UAE Government approved process). For USA, it states ""Certificate must be from a registered practitioner or laboratory"" - which doesn't really answer the question of who/how approved.Also, I'm not sure the Pure Health screening link covers the USA (yet) which is another challenge. Whether it's a developing process or just two different stories - who knows?Edited: 5:31 am, July 30, 2020 "
"@DeminedprincessHi I live in Glasgow and was wondering if you could share a link or contact details for the Eurofins clinic in Glasgow, as I'm due to fly to Dubai in September?Thanks"
"Hi All,Just wanted to check if anyone had the link to the Pure Health approved centers in the UK to check where my nearest one is?Thanks"
@ Rob - here is the link >>> https://screening.purehealth.ae/applicationAlso worth checking the FCO advice page >>> https:/…united-arab-emirates
@ Shaun CThanks for sending that on. Really appreciate it. It looks like there are a choice of two in Glasgow which is great.
"No new News - but I disagree with some of the advice given within this thread :-Updated 1030 29 July 2020Travelling to Dubai on or after 1 August 2020Check if you need a visa here. Depending on your nationality you can get a visa on arrival, or you can apply for your visit visa from Dubai Immigration before you travel.From 1 August 2020 all passengers arriving in Dubai from any destination, including passengers connecting in Dubai, must have a negative COVID-19 test certificate to be accepted on the flight. The test must be taken a maximum of 96 hours before departure. This excludes children under the age of 12 and passengers who have a moderate or severe disability.If the UAE government has specified a designated laboratory in your country of origin, then you must get your certificate from that lab. If it is not specified, please use an accredited lab in your country of departure.You may need to take another COVID-19 PCR test on arrival. If you take a test at the airport, you must remain in your hotel or residence until you receive the test result. If the test result is positive, you will be required to undergo isolation and follow the Dubai Health Authority guidelines. You must also download the COVID-19 – DXB Smart App. iOS - Android All travellers to Dubai, including passengers with a connecting flight, must complete this health declaration form and give it to the staff at check-in. This form will also be available at check-in.You will also need to complete the quarantine undertaking form given to you on board if Dubai is your final destination. Hand this form to the Dubai Health Authority staff on arrival.Emirates then give a link which details the countries which have a nominated test centre- the UK is not in this list. Other threads have actual passengers detailing that a print out of the NHS test result is fine to board your plane and this has been confirmed both in the UK and UAE. Richard from PurelyMaldivesEdited: 2:50 pm, July 30, 2020 "
Thank you for this
"@ Richard - which advice do you disagree with?The UAE & FCO advice is clear, and it says screening via Pure Health approved labs. Only if there are none in your country, then to speak to the airline. The fact that Emirates (for whatever reason) have a different list does not cancel out the overarching advice of UAE Gov and FCO.Now, Emirates MAY allow a non-approved test (i.e. one not from the PH approved list) BUT is it worth the risk?This is not (hopefully) debate about who is right/wrong, it's for the passengers to decide based on the facts, their interpretation and their attitude to risk. The byline of the latest briefed article in The National referenced says,""If there are no Pure Health clinics in travellers’ countries of origin, UAE airlines will provide a list of approved centres"".There are Pure Health approved labs in the UK. Therefore I'd suggest it's safer (in terms of process and reassurance) to use them.Now, Emirates have issued some conflicting advice. Either it was wrong when first advised, or it's updated information, or it is Emirates policy. They are on record in the media as suggesting non-approved labs could be used - which of course, begs the question of accuracy and why there's a process seemingly in place.This is nothing unusual w.r.t. Dubai - just as they said for weeks you must have a test before travel, but then it's okay to be tested at the airport. Similarly, you need a certificate - but nowhere did it say what constituted a certificate.The point I'd make is - if you know there's conflicting information about, would you take a risk or play it safe? It may be overkill to follow the PH approval and it may prove unnecessary BUT I think it's a gamble to rely on anecdotal commentary from different sources that may be incorrect, outdated when you know there is formal advice that contradicts it.Edited: 8:21 am, July 30, 2020 "
"The other point to consider is that Emirates have not updated THAT article page/advice since 23 Jul. The update they've issued is the PR about additional destinations rather than the 'travelling to and from' section. BTW EK is notorious for changing things on their site without document control (e.g. the terms and conditions of the 'free insurance cover') so that's another thing to be conscious of.Journalists were briefed on the 27th with the clarifications/updates ref. approved labs.FCO Advice was updated on 28th.So as it stands, there is the FCO advice and NCEMA UAE Gov advice saying one clear thing and Emirates either saying something different or possibly not having updated their advice.Edited: 8:50 am, July 30, 2020 "
There are U.K. approved clinics via the pure health link.
"@ Demined - thanks, that's the point that folk seem to be overlooking. The advice from both Governments is there to be followed and clear whereas one carrier has possibly not updated its advice.For whatever reason, Emirates advice is (currently) conflicting with UAE Gov & FCO advice, and we may never know the reason why - but it still is. During COVID, it's often been the case that Abu Dhabi & the other Emirates have adopted some protocols whereas Dubi may interpret differently. Maybe Emirates haven't seen the updated advice, maybe they have and will allow passengers, or maybe they know as the Dubai carrier they've tacit approval to interpret differently. But nobody knows the reason, just that it could change and it still carries a risk to ignore the advice.After all, 200,000k + residents are locked out/in of the UAE presently due to conflicting advice and systems/processes that don't work effectively. That's why I'd recommend minimising the risk, taking the UAE approved tests via Pure Health for reassurance. There's an added incentive as the PH-approved tests provide 96 hours whereas the 'others' will (apparently) only be recognised within 72 hours of departure."
"Absolutely agree with ShaunFCO and UAE government advice trumps any mis communication by Emirates.Emirates do say that you should get your pcr test certificate from a UAE Government approved lab it's just that they haven't updated the link with the list of labs.I contacted Randox Health yesterday who were very helpful, they advised me to complete the pure health screening application after which you will get an application number with contact details to make an appointment at your selected centre. They have acquired extra staff to deal with the demand and the cost of £115 is very competitive.I also contacted Emirates who advised that they will only accept a test certificate from an approved lab in the UK. I have emailed Tim Clark (CEO) for clarification before I book flights and will update here when I get a response.@Richard, being in the travel industry I assume you are aware that NHS testing is not available for the purpose of international travel?"
"@ ShaunYeah it's a good shout to look back at threads.It won't be til the 11th September so things could still change up until then, but if things like testing become a little more clearer then I'll be fine for going.I've signed up for the FCO alerts. I do see a certain irony though with the FCO as they've put so many countries as essential travel, yet Luxembourg which has one of the highest rates of COVID in Europe you can go for non-essential travel."
"HaSo my earlier post which was asking and questioning regarding the testing rules for Emirates airlines has been taken down - well done whoever has multiple accounts and has decided to take that action. It is good to see that the Dubai forum is fair in allowing all travellers to have a fair discussion (not) and not just prepared to allow one group of believers to have just their say. Happy travelsRichard from PurelyMaldives ( and yes, this is the correct way which somebody within the travel industry should sign off from TA). If somebody intends to flame and take down this new comment then please contact me first to discuss your reasoning."
"Hello againI have taken a look at the UK FCO advice which many people have referenced. It does indeed state that for entry to the UAE a PureHealth test is required. However later on it specifically clarifies this with particular reference for entry to Dubai (and not the UAE in general) :- “Visitors to DubaiNew procedures for visitors to Dubai were announced by the Government of Dubai on 21 June. Visitors are able to travel to Dubai from 7 July. Further information about what visitors need to do before they travel and what will happen on arrival in Dubai is available on the Government of Dubai website including information about testing on arrival and quarantine.Before visitors fly to Dubai, they will also be required to complete a Health Declaration Form and a Quarantine Form. Both forms need to be printed, completed and handed over to Dubai Health Authority staff on arrival. Visitors to Dubai will also have to register their details on the COVID-19 DXB App.Visitors must have international health insurance before travelling and with effect from 1 August, must show that they have had a negative PCR COVID-19 test a maximum of 96 hours before arrival. (Note nil reference to Pure testing centres). All visitors to Dubai must adhere to all public health measures issued by the Dubai authorities including any requirements to quarantine.”So the UK FCO initially refers to UAE rulings and confusingly later switches to Dubai rulings. My belief is that while Dubai generally adopts government rulings from the overarching UAE it has its’ own Government which can set laws and rulings. Any thoughts from anybody who would actually like to chat rather than just delete entries from people with contrary outlooks?Richard from PurelyMaldives"
"@ Rob - yes, it's very volatile in many places and several countries certainly seem to be on the radar with that R number, including Luxembourg & Belgium,However, the FCO advice is not just restricted to health matters, and I do think the 'shifting sands' of Dubai/UAE comms and the resident approval backlog could be factors also in the 'advice.I'd think a week or so after Eid, once the 'new rules' have bedded in would be a decent time to see how things are going, and perhaps towards beginning of Sep once the new season traditionally starts picking up also."
"Hi all - I've been lurking on this thread for a few days, just a couple of points from me as I am flying out to DXB next Fri for an essential trip. (If this was just a holiday we would reschedule alas we don't have the luxury of putting the trip off by a couple of months.)Travel Insurance: Ours through LBG/AXA essentially says its invalid due to FCO advice, so I have taken out insurance with Battleface - they cover destinations which are advised against travelling by the FCO. They cover medical expenses related to COVID (though please read through the whole policy doc if you too take out a policy - I'm not an advisor and can't attest to the suitability of this insurance for anyone else but myself and my OH). This won't cover curtailment costs, a risk that we are willing to take due to BA's flight cancellation/amendment policy.COVID test: I've paid £120/pp for the purehealth COVID test. Be warned - the system to book appointments is rudimentary e.g. you email your respective lab and wait for them to get back to you. My local lab in Bristol is only open for tests on Weds and Fri and this info is not displayed on the landing page I accessed initially! Look around the whole site (like I should have done initially). Do make sure that when you email the lab, you attach the application .pdf for each test you are looking to book. Also the tests appear to be prioritised by urgency, so if you're flying in the next week or so, make this clear on your email - add it to the title, embolden etc. I figure this process is (very) new and the folk making bookings are doing their best so make it easy for them to help you. There is NO contact centre/contact number whatsoever, only an email address (for EUROFINS, the lab which we will be tested by).Flight cancellations - once the borders opened again I booked our flights through BA, circa 12th July - since then they have been cancelled and rescheduled twice.. so don't be surprised if your route is suddenly binned. COVID testing in Dubai - I've read somewhere that there are clinics offering testing, so we are planning to have that done in our last few days of the trip, I've seen its 370AED? Will do some more digging to confirm.Wish us luck!"
"Thanks for sharing such helpful info AJessica.Ref. local labs in Dubai, there doesn't appear to be a definitive list (yet) but Mediclinic was touted although there are also Purelabs & Aster. As you suggest, it's all still developing in terms of process and clarity but IMO you'd be better off going for the 'chain' clinics rather than the singular ones. My reasoning is just in terms of the process/authorisation if it comes would likely start with the chain labs rather than individuals.It's very tough locally because the testing facilities were swamped even before these new rules (ie ex-DXB came into play) so they're trying to do all they can."
There are nhs stations around. Also private testing centres and charge 149.00 which is quite expensive
I don't think children under eleven need a covid test. There are private clinics that charge 149.00 very expensive I think
This 96 hour maximum covid test I thought it was from departure time of airline but conflicting information states 96 hours from landing in DXBAlso I too got caught with Bristol covid test laboratory opening times they are only open Wednesday Friday Not as stated Monday to Friday just had to request yet again another lab for testing If leaving on 14 th August LHR to DXB anyone got an idea the what the 96 hr window is taken from
"@ Lollypop - it's been a very confusing developing story, so bear with me, please.Here was the original Tweet from NCEMA >>> https:/…2BUT that said 72 hous from time of test to arriving at UAE.Now, two other things happened - the following day, they extended it to 96 hours (time of test to arrival in UAE) BUT different articles were published that suggested,a) the 96 hours was from time to flight departure time.b) that IF the tests were not from Pure Health Approved labs, it could still be 72 hours rather than 96.Also, the FCO sat back to let the dust settle a bit, and issued this ..."" With effect from 1 August, all travellers departing from the UAE to the EU and UK will need to have a negative PCR COVID-19 test result within 96 hours prior to their departure. This is also a requirement for travellers to other countries that require a negative PCR COVID-19 test before arrival.""So, I think the only way to look at it is from the 'worst case', so perhaps take it from arrival time at UAE via Pure Health to time of testing to be a maximum of 96 hours.It's a shame it's like this, but it really is a case of trying to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. I'm sure there will be a period of 'bedding in' whilst things settle and it's unlikely things will be 'set in stone' from the of, but it's all about peace of mind I'd say.Then again, another way of looking it - a lot can change between now and the 14th so there will probably be further confusion sadly.Edited: 1:37 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"@sullivan you're right - there are NHS stations around (including one at Bristol airport - great for us), and that would be preferable seeing as it's a. free b. logistically easier.. however as far as I'm aware the NHS stations don't count as UAE 'accredited' labs which is why we have had to use a lab from the list specified on the Purehealth site. It was $147/£120 for each test.Regarding the NHS site tests as a few others have pointed out earlier in this thread, it sounds like you would effectively have to lie to get a test (e.g. i've got symptoms/been in contact with someone who has COVID) but then retract that when you arrive in UAE as they would ask if you have had symptoms/been in contact within the last x period of time - it feels a bit iffy to give conflicting information, especially now that the advice is to go via an accredited lab anyway.... so we opted to bypass the NHS option (an NHS PCR test what was what I planned to do when I first booked flights but I have since learnt that things can / will change rapidly..!):-)"

"Leigh_Anna the ‘other reason’ been added in last couple of months. Yes and I will be clicking on other so no need to lie. Also emirates have updated their website today and on approved list uk shows as long as approved by public health of England so no need to use the private labs. I’m more worried about the test that you need to get on the way back as I’m travelling on a Monday not sure if local centres will provide tests over the weekend there.Edited: 5:32 am, August 01, 2020 "
"If you're looking for 'reasons why' rather than reasons why not, please do take care to understand the gaps and risks you could be letting yourself in for by following the eccentricity of the Emirates advice.Emirates are currently briefing contrary to FCO and UAE Gov advice and do so with the disclaimer that the advice is constantly changing, so taking a NHS test is a risk that could mean you could be denied boarding.FCO advice & UAE Gov advice is clear, EK's is not. On top of that, their 'free covid cover' has clauses should symptoms avail whilst not following official protocols (ie UAE Gov advice - via Pure Health).This is a direct quote >>> ""COVID-19 testing for the purposes of international travel is not available on the NHS.""https:/…coronavirus-disease-covid-19Screenshot >>> https://d.pr/i/MslmXsFor clarity - I'm not saying don't take the NHS test, just trying to indicate the risk - and they're all the responsibility of the traveller, not even Emirates.. Should said risks be overlooked or ignored, so be it.a) travelling against FCO advice, which could negate insuranceb) you're committed to agree to bear all costs with the declarations on arrival, which *may* not be covered by insurancec) should Emirates decide to comply with the local laws (rather than their own interpretation or implementation) then you could be denied boarding.d) You're considering travelling to a country that has over 200,000 residents 'locked out' (and in) due to sudden rule and process changes."
"Ladxb You still need to have a valid reason to tick the box ""other reason"" of which international travel is not one. Public Health England and Scotland have confirmed this:this.https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/499/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice-for-https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention-advice/coronavirus-disease-covid-19Emirates still say a test is required from an approved lab - pure health of which they are several in the UK. Whilst they may or may not accept a NHS test they have said this can change. Of course, it's up to you if you want to accept the risk."
"There is a lot of 'wilful blindness' in this thread, and the point that is being missed (for whatever reason) is that Emirates are pointing that link to their own list, rather than the official UAE Gov's approved method (Pure Health).Additionally, that document on EK's website is constantly being edited, so whilst the current advice does appear to suggest they will accept NHS tests, it doesn't alter the fact that NHS tests are not meant for travel nor on the official approved list. Risk >> what happens if Emirates decide to take that advice down? They've already shown they will flippantly change documents (e.g. the travel exclusions for their insurance) willy-nilly.Let's look at the real issue here - Emirates is playing a game here because they want you to go to Dubai & they're trying allsorts to get you there ('free insurance' - that may be invalid - and briefing against their own Gov's advice that they know to be wrong).As some point, things may change - and where will you be then? Even people who were quite vociferous about NHS being suitable for travel have since said they're worried if things will change.Of course, it may not change. There may not be an issue. We're not pontificating or moralising (honestly!).The site is meant to be for advice for travellers, and we'd be remiss if we didn't point out the flaws in logic (intentional or otherwise) of this situation.Edited: 6:32 am, August 01, 2020 "
Just checked in. NHS test the official test of the uk is OK. Of course it is. Its where the government get official numbers. Why would a 3rd party lab be any better. Please people don't listen to people on here who really don't have a clue and are just guessing. Emirates are flying you there. So only look at there info. I'm off
plus. Shaun c. The rules for the uae. Are for eitihad for abu Dhabi. Emirates and dubai has there own regs. Straight from the check in desk
"@ Kev - Dubai hasn't issued any different rules, and NCEMA hasn't either on this one. Only Emirates have, as I've mentioned several times before.Sometimes Dubai may issue their own protocols or regs, but not on this time. Points still stand. PS. Hope you still have that comb, and safe travels. Take care."
New update https://m.khaleejtimes.com/uae/dubai/now-fly…
Kev please update on any info you might get about the return covid test and how long it took to get the results. Enjoy.
"Screenshot direct from EK Support >>>https://d.pr/i/yaKuYDQuote: ""right now test negative text/email will suffice.... Also, this is always subject to change""Please try to stick ot facts & read the room Kev; nobody is saying Emirates won't take a NHS test at present. Just trying to point out the gaps around the edges in the assumption or stating interpretations that are untrue.IF Dubai and Emirates have been advised they can allow contrary to the UAE/NCEMA annoucments, it's not published anywhere."
There is no gaps. Nhs is our official health care. Use it to check in and board. Easy as that. Had a couple behind us absolutely fuming at paying 200 pounds each because they read some uae news article. Instead in speaking to the company who fly you into the country
"Kev - so you got the NHS test, you're on the plane. Good for you. It's not a question of you being right, me being wrong though.Some people may chose to follow the advice/regulations of the Government (FCO and UAE) and protect the HNS and not take risks when travelling. Some people may not. The couple behind you did the responsible thing and followed the worst-case scenario based on the FCO, UAE Government and media advice rather than following the 'advice' from someone who told them what they wanted to hear. Again, you're not right, they're not wrong. It's a question of choice, responsibility, means and numerous other factors.There are gaps.

Shaun. Your doing nothing except over complicating it for people. I'll let you know how walking straight into dubai goes
ps. I'm not arguing with you either
"@Kev Yes, please do report back with details of your trip and if you had to test on return to UK as I recall on another thread ""PCR testing before departure"" that you were sure you wouldn't need one.It's good to get first hand feedback.Have a good holiday."
"I literally don't get why it's being so complicated here in the forum. It's pretty clear (from UK perspective I'm talking) that the safest thing to do would be to get a PCR test from a Pure Health approved clinic. Why not just do that to avoid any doubt? By taking it on the NHS, not only are you putting strain on the NHS just because you want to go on a holiday (an already stressed resource), but it's clear that there are mixed messages about it being accepted and that even if it is accepted, this could change at any time.Be safe, and book in with a Pure Health clinic. It's what I've done and it was a simple process."
"@ Kev - it is a complicated situation because the advice from the UAE is constantly changing.If you recall, I did keep it as simple as it could possibly be, and there is one overarching point from the FCO - not to travel to UAE (or at least, all but essential travel).The danger here is to take one bit of advice as 'gospel', act on it or advise others it's all well when to be honest, nobody knows that will be the case. Here's my point - you can't say all is well whilst there are thousands of your countryfolk stranded inside and out of Dubai (and have been for months) for exactly the same reasons (advice changing, confusion over rules, protocols etc.) That's likely the reason the FCO haven't changed their advice ref UAE and the risks are only increased with the continued conflicting advice.The advice is constantly changing and will still do. I have every intention to helping people get to Dubai but to do so cognizant of the risks and situation, which is after all, complex. Sorry it's not binary or black and white.BUT if it stops one person from being denied boarding, or falling foul of EK's insurance cover (which seems to be reliant on UAE government not Emirates approved labs - for now at least) or racking up medical bills because their insurance is invalid etc. then it's all justified.Hopefully, we can agree on at least one thing. Whilst the NHS test was acceptable for you to board, can you be sure it will be for everyone else?Edited: 9:39 am, August 01, 2020 "
"PS. I do value healthy debate, and I don't see this as arguing - but I hope it contributes to the debate and adds context for anyone to make balanced, objective and sound decisions based on facts and experiences."
"""I walked across a 6 lane motorway this morning and didn't get hit by a single car - suggest everyone else tries it tomorrow""We are damned if we offer guidance and links to official sources and damned if we don't. We are damned if we clearly lay out the risks and damned if we don't.People ask questions and we try to give answers and then some smart alec dances on to say we are over complicating matters.I sincerely hope that Kev has a fabulous holiday and that neither him nor any of his fellow travelers need to use their insurance for anything or get turned away at the airport. That they find getting a test for return to the UK easy and that they enjoy their 14 day quarantine on return.I'm tempted to reply to the numerous other thousands of posts on this topic ""Kev said it was fine to do as you please"" so that's all right then"
"Don’t be like Kev.......Don’t wilfully and deliberately defraud the NHS.It’s been stated on this and other threads numerous times before. NHS Coronavirus testing is not for getting off on holidays.Go on the NHS testing website and see it for yourself, it’s crystal clear.Pay up for a private test or don’t go.Sick of the selfish lack of morality of so many punters on this board.

After starting this thread and taking on board all the advice Iv cancelled my holiday to Dubai. I feel it’s just to risky and to much mixed information. After going to Dubai so many times I feel Dubai has its own rules and witnessing this myself what they say goes right or wrong. Good luck everyone !
Thankyou shaun. You have been a great help as has everyone. It’s definitely the right decision and with children going with especially. Dubai is a great place and I have had many amazing holidays but Dubai is not a country to mess with and as I said it has its own rules and people need to understand that. There way or the high way lol. I’m not prepared to risk it Iv been lucky with the agent they have transferred it all over to next year and refunded a small amount of the difference. I’m just have pure health to deal with now and they are not the easiest as no contact number and I’m still waiting on an email of confirmation of a payment from Friday. I could see that getting a Covid test off them was going to become an issue especially when someone on this thread said they only do test 2 days a week. That’s great help not plus £360 down hey hoy fingers crossed for next year.
Some information from today - EK4 departing LHR for DXB - a number of passengers turned away at checkin as they had not had covid PCR tests in the last 96 hours (it seems some didn't know about it) - my sister was able to travel with her COVID test done in Birmingham in the last 72 hours at a private clinic. Check in staff asked about whether she had a test and had a brief look at the test results/letter from the private clinic. The test was £175 per person - results were provided to her on email within 24 hours of the test.
HiHoping to go to Dubai at the end of November. Would really appreciate if someone goes through the process of COVID tests before arrival or on arrival they could update their experience on this forum. Hope anyone who has visited had a great holiday!
Hi does anyone known if children require a test when leaving the UK and also if they meed one when returning from Dubai?
12 and over only.
"Hi everyone,I understand this procedure is no longer in place, but we arrived early morning on the 1st, took a while at passport control as they sorted out contact details and putting you on the system, but test took 2 seconds and was really easy getting through, got results the morning after, one thing to note is they gave us a new form in the queue and didnt take the other two from us. Hopefully the test on the way back goes a smoothly.Again I want to thank Shaun and everyone on this thread who have been a massive help in sorting this out, if it was a holiday I would have cancelled!"
"I went to lhr yesterday, 1st Aug, to speak to check in agents, as I live not far from the airport, I was told you can use the UK NHS hostital test, drive through or home test 72hrs prior to departure and just show the negative results on your phone or printed email. NHS results usually take about 48 hrs. They also said you can take the Pure gold affiliated company tests which costs £130-£150, the 2 UK companies I found are unilabs and eurofins which are accredited by uae puregold, I'm opting for the NHS test. If anyone traveling to Dubai please post another info the check-in give you."

"Hi SAMMY087, as Shaun C and others have repeatedly said on here, it really isn't for Emirates to say whether they will accept a COVID-19 PCR test performed by the NHS. For someone to access an NHS test for the purpose of international travel is not allowed and that is the key point. ""COVID-19 testing for the purposes of international travel is not available on the NHS.""https:/…coronavirus-disease-covid-19"
"Hi, do you think the self isolation may get lifted, I'm going to Dubai end of August. I spoke to 119 NHS, they said hopefully it should change, as in safe to travel?"
No issues with NHS test via Emirates at LHR (move from T3 to T2) this morning (03-AUG). I had a print off of the email for negative test result some others got through just showing the same on their device.
@Mark F - what are you plans to get a test in Dubai to return home. Have you got one booked?
Hi shaun. 96 hours was fine. In dubai. No mention of the app. Insurance or any thing. Passed through as normal.
Mrs forsyth. Yes holiday. Everything open as normal. Masks when in lobby ect or in the malls. Brilliant to be here after months of lockdown
Has a UK citizen managed to travel to Dubai yet? Just wondering if the nhs test result you receive by text is sufficient. Thanks
"Hi Sue,I accept this is a long thread, but a glance in the last 20 posts prior to yours will give you all the answers you seek. Happy travelling!!"
Hi yes I realised there were other answers after I’d posted but didn’t know how to delete my post lol
"Sue, No need to delete your post.It seems that the forum is bonkers at the moment and I can see why you might get flummoxed by the whole situation. Getting the information you want is critical - hopefully you have? If you have, I'm happy!!!"
"@ Sue - if it helps, the main takeaway is the 'rules' are in a state of flux. They announce new rules, then it's not clear if the airlines (e.g. Emirates especially) make their own interpretation (e.g. they produce a list that's different than the approved process from UAE Gov and as briefed to FCO). OR if the rules have been changed.My own guess is it's a bedding-in period also, it's not realistic nor reasonable to drop a new process into place and expect everyone to be onside, especially as the official tests (ie via Pure Health) seem to be having an element of teething issues. That doesn't/won't stop them from keep doing it, mind.That said though, it's not guaranteed that IF people have got into Dubai with only SMS from NHS, they always will.My tip would be to see how the 'dust settles' over the next week or so and see if there are any 'official updates' or if EK change their mind again. Sadly, there will always be a degree of chance and pot luck.Edited: 3:52 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"@Shaun - Couldn't help but notice you just mentioned ""especially as the official tests (ie via Pure Health) seem to be having an element of teething issues."" Please could you elaborate as I have a test booked for later this week in London with a Pure Health approved clinic as I am flying in to Dubai soon.Thanks"
"@ Haroon - nothing out of the ordinary or to worry about. Just seems to be a bit of a bottleneck with demand and only a handful of spots around the UK. To be expected with the situation really, it's not easy to go from zero to up-to-press in days.I just hope they stick with the process and ramp up so as to get more aligned than have the disconnect about Emirates encouraging people to use the NHS. Please do feedback on your experience as it all helps.Edited: 5:10 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Contacted Pure Health this morning as I travel to Dubai this October. The testing centre in Glasgow only opens on a Tuesday or Thursday, not ideal for a Wednesday arrival. The alternative is travel to Liverpool or Belfast as weekend testing is not done.My question is a test done privately by somebody like BUPA be acceptable to gain entry into Dubai?"
Thanks Shaun. Holiday and flights booked with BA...the plot thickens.
"June, there is another Radnox lab in Glasgow but it is mobile based so they send someone to your home to test you, I think there is an extra cost involved"
I have just phoned Emirates and been told it's not the test that has to be done 96hours before departure but the results have to be back 96 hours before departure??? That's not how it reads on Emirates site. I'm reluctant to believe what I've been told??
"Debbie,I have had an NHS test previously (I was selected at random to undertake the test and provide feedback) and the results don’t actually confirm the date that the test was taken? So maybe they are right ?"
"@ Debbie - Ditto; Emirates is far from uniform on their messaging at present, so I'd I take the most cautious approach.Whilst the rules are clear, different media reports, updates and 'announcements' from airlines have made it very confusing. Emirates should have one link, and point everyone to that, but instead, they've different direct staff, suppliers and local airport teams sending conflicting messages. This guy is the spokesman for the those who set the rules (NCEMA) in this instance. Where the discrepancies have developed in the timescale are:-* another 'spokesman' later commented that it's only the PH-approved labs that get 96 hours, other facilities get 72 hours* there are differing reports that the 96 hours is from departure rather than from arrival.https:/…FCO Advice states:"" With effect from 1 August, all travellers departing from the UAE to the EU and UK will need to have a negative PCR COVID-19 test result within 96 hours prior to their departure. This is also a requirement for travellers to other countries that require a negative PCR COVID-19 test before arrival.""Emirates also state on their advice page,"" All passengers arriving in Dubai from any destination, including passengers connecting in Dubai, must have a negative COVID-19 test certificate to be accepted on the flight. The test must be taken a maximum of 96 hours before departure. This excludes children under the age of 12 and passengers who have a moderate or severe disability.""So, to play it safe, work on 96 hours from the time of test to arrival in UAE I'd suggest.Edited: 10:37 am, August 04, 2020 "
"Radnox only want walk in tests for travel to Dubai, home test not an option. I was directed to Liverpool centre for walk in. Contacted Pure Health. They think it's easy enough to go elsewhere in the UK for a test if Glasgow is not available. Clowns!!!"
Eurofins lab only opens on a Tuesday and Thursday currently in the land of square sausage and Irn Bru. Not ideal for a Wednesday morning arrival in Dubai to tick the box for the 96 hours. Fingers crossed the situation changes soon and we get a uniformed message between airlines.
"Hi lynncampbell64, just be wary when looking around for other companies for a COVID-19 test. You mention BUPA for example, but at the minute I think you can only buy the antibody test from them. That is not what you need as it only demonstrates if you have had the infection in the past (and the accuracy is still controversial). If the test sounds quite cheap, then it is probably an antibody test and not the PCR test. To be clear, you need the PCR test when a negative test result is required for travel.Edited: 1:21 pm, August 04, 2020 "
Hi can someone let me know where they have seen the information that we need a test in Dubai for returning to UK? I know the rules have all changes as of Aug 1st so please can someone send me a link for the latest that says I need a test for returning. I know I need to self isolate in UK that is fine. Also does anyone know how much the Dubai approved covid testing centres cost for getting a test in UK to travel to Dubai? I can’t find clearly how much it costs?
They’re about £65. Most malls do they
Mfsx7nm3 - can I just confirm that your post #346 refers to PCR tests being available in shopping malls?That would certainly make them easier to obtain but I wonder if they’re acceptable.....
"Yes of course they’re acceptable, it’s a government initiative."
That’s really good news then - makes accessing tests much easierDo you know if you have to book in advance?Do you have any links / details of who’s doing the tests and when?
"As far as I am aware it’s walk in, there is one in Dubai mall I will hopefully use. Think it’s a medi link"
"Here's the link for the UAE Government's initiatives to combat COVID-19, but beware - it's 216 pages long.https://www.google.com/url…The testing set up referenced in it was primarily aimed at residents, 'people of determination', citizens etc. rather than tourists (as it was issued before the big 'opening up' date of 07 Jul). Whilst there's a massive push to ramp up the mobile testing facilities, they're usually accessed with Emirates ID, again rather than tourists - and as they were cheaper, there's a massive backlog (was a few weeks!)Right now, it's still developing about which labs are approved for the tourists and if they will be discounted (as it's on average 350-400 AED) but Pure Health, Mediclinic and Aster seem to be most accessible/popular and yes, there's a M in Dubai MallThey were trying to get the DHA COVID app to allow booking & centralisation of test results etc. but as always, they're up against it given that it's a very dynamic situation trying to play 'catch up' with the different announcements. Similarly, they were also trying to get the Pure Health screening app to be 'the' system for tourists to register for tests.

This is exactly what I’m so confused with. Did you manage to find anything more on this?
"@ Natasha - what exactly is it you're confused about? The test, the timescales, the labs?"
If we must get tested 96 hours before leaving Dubai for the UK
"Hi Natasha S, I replied to your similar post on the other thread."
"The rule is definitive and clear - you need a negative test 96 hours max before departing. It's the implementation of the rule - ie. where, how much etc. that is still developing, but 350 AED per test in Pure Health, Mediclinic or Aster is a good ballpark."

NHS can’t give you results in the required time so we missed our flight. Tests are only given to people with symptoms. so you also have to pretend. Hopeless.
"My friend went to Dubai last month, went to a drive thru covid testing (free) two days prior. Got the email and showed email on arrival and was perfectly fine. I am also going in August with him this time and we are doing the same thing :) x"
I phoned Emirates airlines and they told me only the UAE government licensed clinics can be tested at so please disregard my earlier messsage that UAE airlines are accepting certificates from any clinics. It's probably best to phone the airline and check yourself.
"This is why I still stick to my appointment at the UAE approved lab instead of going to any others... Reading what Chris said, I guess its crucial to double check with the airlines too to be on the safe side."
"Hi My friend went to Dubai 2 days ago. Relating to the Covid 19 test you do not need a pcr certificate, if you just go to your local NHS testing station that will be fine. All they require at the airport is a negative result which can be shown via a text message or an email. These private companies that are charging £150 for the tests are just making money as you can get this done free from any NHS station."

"@ Ansar - the rule is, you need a certificate. No grey area at all.The interpretation of said rule *may* vary by carriers, and even Emirates (who caused confusion by saying NHS tests were fine before the UAE Gov changed their stance clearly stated 'this may change' and 'to check'.So I believe it's neither sensible nor responsible to suggest people don't need certificates when the FCO and UAE Gov and Emirates main website (as opposed to a few randoms on social media) say otherwise. Just because your mate wasn't checked doesn't mean others won't be, and would you really want to dish out ropey advice?The clear fact is people found ways to bend the rules to suit their own needs, but even then, it was 100% their risk should the tests, certs, whatever not be suitable."
"https://www.arabianbusiness.com/travel-hospi…Update from UAE authorities 5 days agoEdited: 6:45 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"The advice from Emirates Customer service is that they will accept an email from the NHS confirming your test result but not an SMS. For the record, the 96 hour rule is open to scrutiny as even private clinics turnaround time is 48 to 72 hours, that is cutting it really short before your departure time. I understand that the UAE wants to protect its citizens, however there is likely to be a massive travel disruption as a result. Perhaps they should close their borders until they are satisfied that the COVID 19 threat has diminished to what they deem reasonable."
"@ Zak - the advice from EK customer service is erratic and far from uniform, and the big issue IMO is their own website copy does not much their social media and CS replies. It’s like asking ten 10 dogs what their favourite dog food is, then listening to the one that miaows.For the avoidance of doubt, FCO advice is against essential travel to Dubai and perhaps the mixed messages are a factor.

Pre-travel COVID-19 tests may be available in the private sector, however, private testing processes and accuracy of results may vary. This should be discussed with the test provider before payment. If you need to travel internationally for work and require evidence of a test, you should speak to your employer or occupational health adviser."""
"I doubt there's a deal, but of course - it's not in Emirates's interest to have a) passengers denied boarding and b) having to cancel flights because passengers have infected others on their flights (two separate incidents, both EK so far).Dubai wants to welcome tourists back, and the UAE (not Dubai) announced the 'new rules' on 23 Jul, which are basically a strengthening of the existing rules in that you need PCR test to board, rather than taking on arrival.However, Emirates from the get-go briefed contrary to the official UAE advice that incentivised UK travellers (one of Emirates's main customer base) to use NHS tests, despite FCO advice not to travel and perhaps they didn't know (or more likely, care) that NHS tests stated on their home page 'not for travel purposes'For around a week, Emirates did not officially state this directly unequivocally, but rather across social media messages. Then local media reported that in alignment with the announcements of Emirates, other approved tests could be used (suggesting not just the Pure Health ones)The other major change in the last week was that Dubai, unlike the other emirates, now does not require travellers to register via ICA (which could have proved to be another barrier for travellers)Ultimately, it comes down to interests. Emirates want people to travel, and travellers want to travel even if their own Government may tell them not to travel to UAE nor use the NHS for testing.All we need now is H from Line of Duty to be revealed as an Emirates employee."
"Hi Lynphd,I completely understand, having read post 365, however this was not a one off event. The Customer service has confirmed on three occasions. Essentially, all Emirates are concerned with is that you are Negative for Covid-19 and are perhaps relaxed about how this result has come about. The NHS test is free to use and there is currently no regulation which states you cannot get tested or use the test to prove you are free of COVID-19 when flying. Consider also that private companies in the UK are charging extortionate money for a simple PCR test, it does not surprise me that people will use the NHS test and results to prove they are free from COVID-19."
"Also, Shaun C could not have said it better, this ultimately is a matter of interests."
"Hi Zak, I think people are hearing what they want to hear from Emirates. If someone says you can get around paying a fee, I'm sure many are glad to hear it without further thought about whether it is right.'Consider also that private companies in the UK are charging extortionate money for a simple PCR test""I wouldn't class it as a ""simple"" diagnostic lab test when compared with other non-molecular NHS tests. I guess you've never had to pay out for the specialised lab equipment and the reagents required to do an RT PCR test. The NHS has had to pay out for reagents, specialised equipment, staff training and to bring in companies such as Randox to help them with increasing NHS testing capacity. It costs money to do the test - whether that is by the NHS or a private company.Edited: 7:49 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Slightly different issue, but shows how 'interests' drive policy/rule changes. Granted, this is *only* Gulf News, but it's clear what the play is. Tourists - fly to Dubai - whilst 'stranded' residents (who number in hundreds of thousands) can now come back, but have to fly into AUH. No doubt the latter will boost Etihad's coffers just when they're announcing the reinstatement of routes...https://gulfnews.com/travel/good-news-no-mor…"
"I'm due to travel from the UK in September (been trying to get home for MONTHS now, not for leisure!) and I've been reading up on this. Just thought I would share this tweet I just found: https://freeimage.host/i/dVrHtRIt is a message from Emirates Support and it specifically says NHS test results are acceptable (dated today - 11 August). Not advocating one thing or another, just thought I'd add more (relevant) confusion to the confusion."
"Hi, I’m traveling to Dubai from LHR mid September and I was wondering if anyone has been with them yet? If so what was it like and did you have to do a “pure health” COVID test or was an NHS one sufficient enough? ThanksHarvey"
"Hi there, I'm transiting through Dubai trying to get home to New Zealand in late September. I was just wondering if anybody knew whether the covid-19 test result only has to be valid (ie within 96 hours) for departing from the UK to Dubai or still be valid for transit flights out from Dubai? When I spoke to Emirates on the phone they seemed to think it had to still be valid for the onwards flight but that makes getting a covid test almost impossible with the 7hr flight from London and then a 13hr stop over on top of the 48 hours for result to come back and Purehealth testing centres shut on weekends. Has anybody had any experience of this? All a bit of a nightmare isn't it"
"The *official* advice has always been 96 hours before departure is your maximum window between testing and boarding.However, nothing is constant with these things.Are you interlining on one booking? If so that should help your case as it's then the responsibility of the initial check-in staff to ensure all is in order. So are Emirates suggesting the 96 hours window is from the departure time of the ex-DXB flight (ie 20 hours less?). As always with these things, it comes down to how 'safe' you want to play it - as they'll always say it's your responsibility. * The safest option is to work from the departure time of the second flight that makes it harder do a test and get results.* The more cavalier option is to cover yourself, get it in writing from EK - it's currently not saying on the website that they seem to be telling you BTW (which isn't unusual BTW) as it's 96 hours from departure and do a 'Karen' if they start kicking off at check-in. With things as they are at the moment, there's every chance they won't bat an eyelid because they can't show you it's wrong (according to their website)."
Does anyone know if British airways accept the nhs test
"@Mohammed - British Airways will.Note the official advice is it's the traveller's responsibility to check with the carrier, as things may change and after all, they're the one checking you in (or possible denying boarding).Please do this rather than trust second-hand info in forums or social media, which could always be old or incorrect. You need to check with them sadly."
Thanks Shaun. Point well made
"Hi all,I travelled to Dubai on 6th August and came back today. NHS printed email is absolutely fine. Had to do another test in Dubai to come back, did this at the Aster clinic but Saudi German Hospital and Al Zara hospital are both offering it too. Cost about £65. No issues going or coming, Dubai is business as usual. Any questions, please inbox me."
"@Mohammed, BA say on their website:""PCR Covid-19 test aren't currently available through the NHS for travel purposes""https:/…latest-informationScroll down to FAQ's.I have also seen a recent post on another forum that BA were sending texts to passengers a few days prior to departure reminding them not to use the NHS."
"Here's the thing. It's a numbers game, and ultimately it may come down to that young person having a bad day at check-in, or who doesn't know the rules, or the latest policy etc.BA's FAQ (screenshot) is pretty clear >>> https://d.pr/i/QkQKQw It may be that BA is trying to discourage NHS testing, whilst other airlines are encouraging it. It's all about taking that chance and what you personally feel comfortable with. The same argument still stands - many folks may say it's fine, or they've seen something on social media etc. but that doesn't mean they are 100% confident and not worrying or pulling hair out trying to get clarity.What works today somewhere may not work somewhere else - so take care to reassure yourself accordingly."
"Shaun, Note the date of the BA update was 12/8/20 so not sure whether this is a new policy or not but yes, it's pretty clear."
"Hi there, can I ask where you got your NHS test done? Was it at a designated drive through test centre? Also how did you manage to get a test, what did you say when booking? I’ve been told that NHS won’t do tests just for people to go on holiday and that you have to be showing Coronavirus symptoms?"
"Hi, we arrived in Dubai yesterday from the UK. To start with I’ll say it was very stress and hassle free. Arrived at Heathrow BA check in desk we were asked for our passports and negative COVID test taken within the last 4 days prior to arrival in Dubai. Showed them a print out of the negative NHS test we had. The result MUST be printed they won’t let u board without a negative PRINTED test that is within 4 days of arrival a few people where denied boarding at the gate and sent away. This caused us 1.5hrs delay as they had to take the passengers luggage off before we left. Arrival in Dubai was busy but we used family checkin and it was a lot quicker probably about a 10 minute wait I dare say the normal que was over 2 hours. All the boarder agent wanted to see was our passport and printed copy of our negative result. Didn’t ask to see the app we had to download, didn’t ask to see our proof of travel insurance. Left the airport we had to walk past a few thermal monitoring cameras. Got to our hotel and everything is normal the only difference is everyone has to wear a face covering in public indoor spaces. I will add I saw a lot of people with private COVID tests that cost £100’s the NHS test did the same job. I know people will say it’s not good to use the NHS but in the UK we have a capacity for over 350,000 tests a day and they are doing half that so we are not taking a test away from someone else who needs it. We have paid taxes all our lives."
Please let me know where you got your NHS COVID test done. I can’t find it anywhere with NHS
"Yeah I would like to know the same please, I certainly couldn’t pretend to have symptoms Just to get a nhs test."
"@ Jay - were the people denied at the gate, or refused boarding at the check-in desk? Seems strange that they let them load luggage, only to deny boarding at the gate (rather than a desk)Thanks for posting your updates BTW, always helpful for others."
"Hi - where did you get your test done on Dubai to be able to fly back to UK please? Thanks, Louise"
"If you are traveling from Los Angeles and need a RT-PCT test , there is a facility called MyConciergeMD in Beverly Hills that gets results for RT-PCR in about 24 hours and it is accepted by all airlines ...would try them as they are doing a great job getting results for travelers"
"Jay J , Can I ask did your NHS results have day and time the test was done? My daughter has just had symptoms and got results today but only her name and DOB on it no info when test was done? Thankfully she was neg!Edited: 12:36 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"I can also confirm my wife, 2 year old son and I travelled out relatively hassle free yesterday on emirates from Manchester. We booked NHS tests at a local drive through test centre and got the results the next day (we live in a high risk area and that was one of the options when selecting a reason for booking a test). All that was required at check-in in Manchester, and immigration in DXB was to show a printed copy of the negative result email. @Debbie I, like you say, this doesn't show the time the test was done, just the time the email was sent but we didn't have any issues. This print out was kept by the immigration officer stamping our passport in DXB. We weren't asked to take a test in DXB either. We were also provided with a form to fill in whilst stood in the check in queue that had to be handed in before boarding so make sure you have a pen. I gave mine to someone who didn't have one and boarded the plane (as the check-in queue was so long it took ages and didn't move very fast and we had to run after going through security to make the flight even though we turned up at the airport in plenty of time) and then found out there was another form to fill in on the flight and now I had no pen! This form was provided by emirates on the plane and to be handed in at immigration in Dubai. The flight was full and we were required to wear a mask at all times except for eating. Emirates even provided a PPE pack on the plane. All in all I spent a lot of time worrying and searching for answers when there really was no need."
"@ Aamir - good to hear your feedback but I don’t think it’s fair to say there was “no need.” Yes it may seem you stressed or perhaps overkill in research, but at least you gave yourself the best chance. Better that than the other way hey?Truth is, there is every need to be prepared and err on the side of caution. Just because everything went well for you doesn’t mean it will for the next person.Dubai can be flippant as can travelling in general but the rules and measures are there and ultimately, it’s the traveller’s fault in anything goes wrong as it’s their responsibility to ensure they’re compliant.PS Enjoy Dubai and please do feedback how it goesEdited: 4:15 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"As if to prove a point, this is how flippant the authorities can be in changing rules.Whilst this rule is for residents, the background is - 200,000+ residents have been waiting months to get back due to needing approvals that couldn’t be processed. They were told last week can come back as no approvals needed, now it’s been changed back. Thousands locked in & out of Dubai.https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/dubai/icagd…This is exactly why we post all of the updates and facts so people can make balanced, objective and responsible decisions. Remember, many of those residents stuck in limbo are likely your fellow countrymen when you may wonder why the FCO advice is as it is."
I feel quite guilty worrying about my own holiday when so may residents are still unable to return. It's just disgraceful the way they are being treated.Not much chance of FCO advice changing any time soon then.
"Hi, yes the people got past check in desk even thought they wanted to see the test! It did seem very strange to us that they was then denied boarding at the gate as this caused delays leaving over 1.5 hours to wait for baggage handlers to get their luggage off I hope British Airways learns from this. When we was waiting at the gate I over heard a conversation one passenger had a test that was 7 days old he was sent back to the check in desk, others were claiming they can have a test on arrival in Dubai but they were also sent away. I think one other was a resident also sent away."
The NHS results just have the time and date the email was sent (must be printed) we also printed the test appointment email confirmation to show when the test was done but didn’t need it. I saw a lot of people who paid for a private test and their emails where very similar just saying you don’t have corona virus. I will also add we are staying at the Atlantis Palm hotel and they are doing testing in the hotel medical clinic for anyone who needs it. Cost is 400AED for guaranteed 24 hours results and 500AED for guaranteed 12 hours results just needs to be booked in advance but they do them every day between 10-12noon. This is good as I didn’t want to travel to the local hospital to do it. I believe most hotels are offering this service we booked transfers with desert adventures and they also offer a service where someone will come to your hotel and do the test on your room. Same cost as above. Hope this helps.
"@ Jay - crikey that sounds a bit of a calamity! I guess at present there's a lot of 'bedding in' with check-in staff adapting to the rules and their policies, let alone the issue of uninformed travellers (e.g. the 7-day test and thinking they could still test on arrival). It just goes to show it's worth being prepared and well-researched, hey?As for the in-room tests, where there's a chance to make money, Dubai's often quick to it. I guess the issue with these is IF they change the rules on which labs are recognised although I guess they won't bother now as it's another thing to faff about with.Cheers for the feedback!"
@Shaun yes I totally agree the testing is mainly for the money we could get a taxi to Sharjah and get a free test but the taxi is 600AED return so not worth the time really? I think to start with you had to get a test a hospital can’t remember the name but it was owned by a Dubai company so again to get money. I learned today that all free video calling apps like FaceTime and whatts app are banned in Dubai because they are free to use and nothing is free in Dubai. I tried to FaceTime over the hotel Wi-Fi and it wouldn’t work.

"Hi,Can anyone confirm if BA accept the NHS test result?Edited: 7:52 am, August 17, 2020 "
@ Junaid - see post #384.
"Sorry can I just ask I’m also travelling to Dubai to stay at Atlantis but on this Friday, I’m looking at paying £200 tomorrow for a covid test privately as I thought the nhs one wouldn’t be accepted. After looking at this thread I’m more confused are you saying if we take a nhs test and print the result this will be accepted? I’m flying with emirates any help would be hugely appreciated!"
"Hi I can’t speak for Emirates as I flew British Airways but my printed NHS test was fine for both the airline and Dubai immigration. Dubai immigration only very quickly looked at the NHS print out I’d say a quick glance at most, they didn’t ask to see any proof of insurance which is also a requirement to have that printed."
You can get the test it only takes 24 hours and have it to present on your arrival in Dubia . Then I believe you need another one before you leave to arrive in uk !!!! Google Covid test in your area . Good luck
"I’m traveling in December with BA hopefully there will be changes by then , how long did the test take to do before coming back to UK"
I rang emirates and the lady said you just need to print your negative results. Can anyone help to answer my query please? Has anyone gone to uk airport and just showed a printed email to say your negative for the covid test and they have let you go on the flight and enter the country?
I am also travelling to Dubai and onto RAK in September and have been advised by Emirates regarding the PCR Test which I know I have to undertake 96 hours before leaving UK but also to return to UK I must undertake the test in the UAE again 96 hours before flying. Has anyone just returned from Dubai and has the answers?
"Yes they do Jacqui - and they're all on the recent threads around this Forum. Recent trip reports, experiences etc. - all possible queries answered."
We are due to fly to Dubai on the 10th September from Heathrow with British Airways.We have tried to contact them to see if a nhs Covid 19 test is accepted but they haven’t replied to any messages about this. Has anyone flown from Heathrow with British Airways and had any issues with just the nhs test.
Hi How did your travel to Dubai go and where did you get tested is a NHS test acceptableThanksAngela
@peachy on the BA website under test UAE You must take a PCR Covid-19 test before you travel to the UAE and only travel if your test is negative. You must bring a printed copy of your test results. You can use any trusted and certified laboratories in your country of origin.

"Just landed in Dubai not long ago. I flew with BA at LHR, got my certificate out from NHS and was fine, he even said as he was reading it “NHS Covid test... negative... yep go straight to the desk.” Few other people in front also did NHS test. One thing to do tho, print off your appointment!!! I read on this forum before that a lot of people did it but didn’t need it, at check in BA were calculating hours from your appointment time.As for coming into DXB, my guy at immigration didn’t ask for anything... just stamped my passport and waved me through. As for my fiancé - he had to hand in his certificate and forms.Hope this helps!"
