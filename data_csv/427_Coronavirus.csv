Good day everyone. Me and my husband are travelling to Athens and Kefalonia in September. Im worried about all the feedback for the coronavirus. Do you think everything will be open to visit then? Regards
"Hi Leandri It’s way, way too early to say.The situations changing daily worldwide, it won’t only be the situation in Greece at the time that comes into play but also that in our own countries too."
"Hi Leandri,I agree with Fiscardofan, much too early to know.However the Greek government are today (13th March) discussing closing or restricting opening of restaurants etc. I though am expecting to go in July and have no intention at this moment of cancelling or rearranging my holiday.Bob"
"There is information on the Kefalonia Pulse website regularly which is quite informative.https:/…We are due to fly out late May, and at this stage we are determined to go, especially as we paid for the holiday last month ! We are however watching the changing circumstances as we are both senior citizens and I have a health condition . One statistic I have calculated, the govt think at the moment there are as many as 10,000 people with the virus in the UK, that is less than 00.02% of the population.Barry SEdited: 12:15 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Now announced that all cafes, bars and tavernas to be closed as from Monday.No indication as to for how long."
"September is a long weatheroff, hopefully with the warmer weather in summer, the situation may be a lot better."
I’d forget May
Sadly we’re coming to that conclusion too thisis....
My post was mean’t to read September is a long way off.
Thats us sitting in the garden then...lets just hope they say you cant fly and then we can get a full refund
"There is a very informative thread on the Athens TA Forum regarding corona virus, it's worth monitoring that one IMHO"
Looks like we will be doing an extra trip down to the West Country with our caravan this year !No problem. Alfie can run and bark on beaches instead of being in Kennels.
You are assuming non essential travel will be okay in this country when you plan on travelling. If we end up like Italy (and who knows for how long) even taking a caravan somewhere will not be permitted.Roll on 2021 I say.
"True - Hadn't thought sitting in or near the caravan,cooking our own meals insead of going to the Pub and walking on beaches would be a problem.Might be the back garden then with a few tinnies and the Barby"
Hi Stanthe GreekfanThere are currently 5 threads on the first page of the Athens TA Forum. Which one did you mean?
"Thanks YlassasYou can also sign up for email alerts from the Gov.uk website. There are daily updates with the facts virtually every day at the minute. Search Google for ""Gov.uk"" then when in their website search for ""Greece travel"". When that page of options comes up, the top answer should be ""Greece travel advice"". Click on that to go through to the main page where there is an option to sign up for email alerts. As anything changes, you get an email alert. It's really simple. The latest one was today and contained all the official info on the cafes bars etc."
"Not sure if TA will allow the link, so it might get blocked, but simpler than all the searching ishttps:/…greeceHope everybody stays safe.Steve"
"Video posted today on Inkefalonia of Argostoli today, showing how empty it is, so sad when last weekend it was packed."
All tourist accommodation is to be closed until the end of April.
Due there April 4th - do you think I should just give up hope ?
Nic G - see previous post 20. Seasonal accomodation will not be opening until May 1st; Tavernas and bars will also be closed
Nic who are you flying with? Many not flying till May earliest now
I am due to fly with TUI on 7 May. Looking unlikely now.
Us too!
Hospitality operations apparently suspended until the end of April. After that things will get back to normal according to the evolution .Nice to see that most of the airplane companies operating at PVK Preveza airport are offering free flight modifications. Few of Our guests postponed their April trip in Lefkada already .
Interesting reading on the Kefalonia Pulse website re actual numbers of cases in Kefalonia nd Greece as a whole.
On the main Greece forum Nicksy kindly provided the following link to an interactive map showing the known cases in Greece -https://coronavirus.pineza.eu/
"Greece has taken stringent measures to ensure the virus does not spread in Greece. The virus can not live in hot environments, so by September I believe the cases will be minimal and all tourist facilities open. We are hope for this to happen from May."
"Hi, agree apart from the hot environments bit, they do not know if this is fact yet, some places in southern hem which are in summer have it"
From 6am tomorrow (21st March) no one can travel to a Greek island unless they are a resident there - proven by showing a tax certificate. No idea how long this will last for. It's not good here but oh how I feel for the Greek people whose livelihood depends on tourism.
Post #29 “ The virus can not live in hot environments” there is absolutely no scientific evidence of this. On last evenings tv news here (UK) they actually got the guy who had started that false claim on the phone. He’s now removed the claim from his list of Coronavirus’facts’ online and apologised.
First case on the island.nkefalonia.gr/koinonia/80009-ektakto-proto-k…
"Oh dear, guess it was only a matter of time!Couldn’t get the link @ #39 to work, see if this one does -https://kefaloniapulse.homeinkefalonia.prope…"
"With the second virus on its way, we should really survive today and worry about holiday closer to date. I cannot see it being safe until end of the year I may add."
"Sorry, my error try thisinkefalonia.gr/koinonia/80009-ektakto-proto-…"
"Wake up and smell the coffee, we are in the middle of the biggest crisis since the second world war! Forget your holiday."
Your trip will not happen
We were due to go in may but as you said we are working with the idea that it will not be happening. Cant see any flights being available. We also have to think of the security of out Greek friends.
Just had the return flight cancelled by easyjet on June 1st .
easyJet cancelled my flight for June the 1st .
Easyjet has suspended ALL flights untill further notice.https:/…
Hi Bob......nice to read/see you again.....we have booked for September but for the first time moving away from Svoronata as that area is now too busy for us and heading to Sami......I hope we can both get to our favourite Island......keep safe
"I hope this post is allowed & isn’t a duplicate. I haven’t visited the forum for some time as although I returned twice after my husband died in 2016 , it was all too painful.It has been reported on the Kefalonia Unplugged forum on Facebook that this awful virus is now on the island & 1 person has been confirmed as having it.There is a campaign set up to buy a ventilator for Argostoli hospital. When my husband was treated there the care he received was 2nd to none but because of the austerity measures even then they were very short of basic equipment.If anyone is interested the link ishttps:/…"
"We’re booked to go on 13th September (Lourdas) and just hope We’ll get there.Very reticence to cancel at this point owing to the fact we may be asked to pay the full deposit and also don’t want to jump too quickly anyway.I’m looking at it this way.If we pay the full amount and it gets cancelled we get our money back anyway.If the government has relaxed the rules and TUI are flying we go.Our only fear, if that’s the right word is being on a plane full of people who may potentially be carriers of this thing.Then again I suppose if there’s any uncertainty the government will restrict travel anyway."
"We're also due to go in September...to Lourdas as well !Just gonna play it by ear at the moment. But the other thing to consider is what the situation in Greece and Kefalonia in particular, will be like then.......or could potentially be bad still there. I think we could be in for the long haul with this awful thing."
"There will be no holidays anywhere this summer even September or October most travel firms letting you defer summer 2020 bookings to 2021 summer as they do not want to refund your money they are also letting you move your deposits to next year as well as much as it breaks my heart not going to the island this year we have increased are booking to 3 weeks instead of 2 next year to make up for the disappointmentEdited: 8:02 pm, April 04, 2020 "
My accomadation on Kefalonia (in Svoronata ) contacted me today to say they are closed for the entire summer season and won't be reopening until 2021. The risk is too high !
"Ming, which accomodation is that ? We are booked at the Astra Village this summer."
"Barry It is the apartments opposite Dum Spiros restaurant in Svoronata village itself. They aren't involved with any holiday companies and can only be booked independently, so they aren't under any pressure from travel agencies to stay open. They took the decision of their own accord, because 80% of their clients are from the UK and the owners decided it wasn't worth the risk. It would of been my 25th consecutive year of staying in Svoronata, but I totally understand their outlook on things.No official announcement has been made yet, but from the way the owner spoke (I spoke to her on the phone personally) I wouldn't expect to many places to be open in that area, certainly not till much later in the season anyway."
"My daughter received an e mail today from Jet2 to say her holiday 3rd week in May is cancelled, and they will ring her to discuss options."
Sorry to hear that Barry - at least they're willing to discuss the options which is good.When is your holiday booked for in the summer ? We are booked for early September - but have booked flights and accommodation separately.......so have a feeling we won't know if the flights (Easyjet) are cancelled until nearer July/Aug.
"We have flights booked for early September too with TUI, having originally booked with Thomas Cook! Not looking brilliant atm, but we live in hope."
"Hi, can you advise the source of this information please?Question directed to Susan A.Thanks.Edited: 4:05 am, April 08, 2020 "
"RockyQ, We are booked for 28/5. My heart thinks we are going, my head knows we are not. We can rebook on the Tui website now, I want to change to next year, my wife wants early September. We are finding it difficult to discuss with this terrible tragedy unfolding."
"We are due to go on 10th May but I think there is zero chance of us going and in all honestly I don’t want to go and be worrying. Holidays are supposed to be relaxing and at the moment we are far from relaxing. I am waiting for Tui to get in touch so at least we can hopefully get a refund as me and my other half are being furloughed so money is tight right now. I have considered moving it to next May but just feel uneasy about doing that right now. Who’d have thought in our lifetime we would be facing this but, our holidays on the grand scale of things are a minor inconvenience compared to what some poor people are going through xx"
"Yes Barry, indeed - terrible tragedy is right and it does seem trivial to be thinking about holidays compared to the suffering that many have and are enduring - and my heart goes out to them. I also feel sorry for the small tourist businesses etc everywhere, but especially those we know in Kefalonia, that could go out of business in all this."
Source is common sense. Jet2 flights cancelled up to 17th june for now but in reality they will be extending this after this date does anyone really think this will be over in a few weeks? why would Greece let thousands of tourists come to the islands and bring this vile virus with them when Greece has been nowhere near as infected than the rest of europe jet2 allowing you defer to 2021 were charging £80 to do this but have now dropped this charge
"HiYep you’re right. I got an email last night saying about the cancellation, sad and disappointing but as I said nothing compare to what some people are going through right now."
"Ah okay, so it wasn’t a confirmed official source but your point of view. You maybe right but I certainly hope not. Greece is already financially bankrupt so losing a season or tourism money is the last thing they need.I’m still hopeful for my couple of weeks in July."
Hi due to go in August but don't hold out much hope. It's not so much whether the UK open the borders up but whether Greece wants to be overrun by UK tourists. I know they will financially suffer but that is nothing to their health and continued good management of the virus....If borders are gradually opened then I have read articles that say there will be stringent procedures to go through and UK residents may not be considered...…..Who knows in these unprecedented times?? Keep safe!
We were due to fly out with TUI on 7 May. We have now moved this to May 2021 instead. Something to look forward to. Just hope everything is getting back to normal by then because there are no guarantees.
No chance of that as well
None of them giving refunds just letting you defer. Or worst still offering you voucher for the value of the cost of your holiday. Worth less piece of paper as who knows how many travel company's will go bust or hotel s will close down for good do not except vouchers what. soever this might well even affect summer 2021 take nothing for granted there could be 2nd and 3rd waves of this vile virus over the next 12 months
"Thanks for the link rover33507, hope your okay"
"Yes, absolutely - apparently Which were on tv this morning saying that travel companies/airlines not offering a full refund are breaking the law and they were calling on govt to help travel firms out. So, refusing a voucher seems within your rights - and, as you say, who knows what will happen between now and next year."
"It is all well and good accepting a voucher to support the travel industry, but if the company goes bump, you are left with a worthless piece of paper to the tune of hundreds or even thousands of pounds.The government need to step in."
Hi everyoneHow are you all feeling about the situation now?My partner and I are due to fly out on 8th June. Both healthy and both (probably) had COVID-19. We are both so desperate for our holiday and still not had official cancellation.
"Unfortunately, I can’t see your holiday going ahead. They are normally cancelling about 2 weeks before."
"After yesterday’s UK announcement I think we all need to accept there will be no 2020 season. I can’t see how airlines will justify half empty socially distanced planes, the impact for their air crew in being exposed makes it an almost non starter and I can’t imagine many people ( I sadly can’t ) having a holiday then needing another 2 weeks back home off work to Self isolate. 2021 will be all the more special for when we get through this thing! Roll on summer 21 I say!"
"You will possibly find other countries asking people to self isolate for 2 weeks, when they arrive on a flight, this will make holidays a non starter."
"Well, I think the Greek govt are actively trying to get the tourist season started, as it is such a big part of the Greek economy. The Greek PM has written to the President of the EC calling for 'an acceleration of all movements....so that the tourist season is not lost...'and '...our goal is to work to resume travel between EU countries by June 15th where possible.' He's saying that all traveller's should have a coronavirus test 3 days before travel and that no quarantine period should be in place on their return to their own country (despite some having that requirement now - although that may change by June 15th). Greece has done very well in controlling the spread of coronavirus and have already started relaxing some lockdown measures, so you never know ! .........full article here -https://kefaloniapulse.homeinkefalonia.prope…"
Go on you Greeeee-eeee-ce !
Not happening Mate! Cyprus has closed this year to Brits. Greece will definitely follow suit☹️
"I was due to go to the Ionian Islands this September, hunting down my family roots, but would not consider travelling anywhere in Europe until next year. I would think that anyone over 70 with underlying health conditions should think not only of their holiday but also those health workers who would be risking their own lives if you become ill in Greece . I think we need to be extremely careful this year especially as even with low infection rates in the Greek Islands, people from anywhere may be travelling there and bring the disease, Err on the side of caution not only for your own sake but to spare the health workers."
So what are the views now on the chances of a Late July/Early August trip to Kefalonia from UK? Im thinking it's possible but will everything (restaurant and shops) be open?
"Hi,Not everything will be open but in my opinion most tavernas, cafe/bars and shops will. Some tavernas may decide to open evenings only. I expect some tourist shops to open a bit later in the day and perhaps not stay open so late.I still hold out a small hope of being able to drive to the island at the beginning of July.Bob"
"Yes, it seems there's some hope there. We'd be going end July so maybe more chance there. Also thinking Villa might be better bet than Hotel/SC? Some hotels seem to not be opening?We were in Lourdas last year. Didn't expect to be going back so soon (possibly!)."
"Just had my second attempt booking to Kefalonia 1-21 September 2020 cancelled due to COVID-19 risk by TUI.Edited: 10:01 am, July 10, 2020 "
I don't understand why they're doing that. Do they know something we don't?
More likely either the hotel/accommodation isn’t opening or the reduced flight schedule doesn’t cover the booking
I have a home in Kefalonia and my first booking with Tui was in June 2020 - cancelled later due to COVID-19. I rebooked for September and was told today cancelled to Our Gov Saying only essential travel in September.My Greek friends tell me KEF has had no virus and are wary of us UK bods going there whilst we had big problems with high cases here . Plus UK are querying a second spike of COVID around October time.
"Hi, they’ve had 1 case & they can’t wait for us to return on the 15th many places opening due to the return of uk tourists. Boarders are now open & there’s no way of telling what will happen in Sept FCO will not make such a statementEdited: 11:08 am, July 10, 2020 "
"Greece is one of the 59 countries listed as being exempt from the 'non-essential travel' information from the FCO. The British Ambassador to Greece only today confirmed this and that all flights from UK to Greece and vice-versa could start to operate again from 15 July. We have a holiday booked in September too, but have not had any notice of cancellation - though we haven't decided whether we are going yet anyway.The Greek authorities are holding a meeting today to discuss the 'spike' that has occured at the land border with Bulgaria, when about 30 positive cases were discovered amongst tourists travelling from Serbia. The plan appears to be to move to testing everyone entering the country at all entry points, instead of sample testing as they were doing."
"Agree totally with thisis... and RockyQSome places decided early on to close for the season, some decided to open, but many sat on the fence until they heard whether the Brits were coming. Since being given the green light for travel from 15/7 many places have leapt off the fence and are opening in eager anticipation of our arrival.I really can’t see (& I’ve looked) the FCO giving advice on what might happen in 2 months time. If a link can be provided that contradicts that then I’ll happily apologise.foxinsox- Just being curious (nosey) and not meant in any other way but why if you have a home on the island are you relying on (& believing) TUI who from all accounts haven’t been the most forthcoming, honest or reliable operator during these difficult times?"
I’ve just booked to Kefalonia with Easyjet
White Rocks hotel is not opening this year (2020)
"I’m going to kefalonia on Wednesday, flying to Corfu then taking 2 ferries to get there, can’t wait"
I have just cancelled my September hotel booking in Agia Efimia and my club class BA flight from Heathrow. I dont see the point in risking the spot check tests at immigration picking up a carrier and being quarantined for the duration of my holiday and then having to quarantine o n arrival back in the U.K. Do people actually realise the conditions of entry into Greece? I one passenger on the plane or ferry proves positive then ALL PASSENGERS ARE LOCKED DOWN!!!!!!!!!!! Lucky for me I made the bookings last year and took out insurance last year.
Are you up to date with the entry requirements? You do realise you will have no insurance cover for any C-19 related issues including repatriation? Look whats going on in Spain right now! R factor is at plus3 https:/…
"Scaremongering rubbish! loads of insurance companies now covering Covid, the whole plane do not have to quarantine if someone tests positive during a random test. If travelling with Tui for example they have extra Covid cover which covers you for getting home if the worse should happen"
"#94 & 95 Obviously the decision whether or not to travel is down to the individual (taking FCO advise into consideration)However your warning re insurance and lockdown are totally incorrect and should not be used to try and persuade people to make the same decision as you.Some people’s insurance, whether purchased pre or post pandemic may well include COVID 19 cover, it depends on the individual policy.If someone on the plane test as positive only the people 2 seats in either direction may be subject to quarantine."
By the way the current entry conditions are in place until the end of August.The Greek Hoteliers Association has canvassed their Government for the requirements to be replaced by a test in your home country before travel. However the arrangements from 1 September have still to be announced.
#95You only have invalid insurance cover if you travel against FOC advice - e.g. like Spain right now.Greece does not have a FOC against travel there.
"Hi JustMeHerandtheDog,I would have thought anyone who travels Club Class would be able to get their facts right!You say that you are not coming to Kefalonia this year - your loss, our gain!Edited: 6:12 pm, July 27, 2020 "
It seems a bit odd that there is no option on Tripadvisor to ask for a post to be removed if it contains incorrect / false information.
"#101. Think I’d opt for removal by selecting ‘Not family friendly/illegal’ in that case. It certainly can’t be right to post incorrect information, though of course some do it unknowingly whilst actually trying to help others. There’s a big difference though with the intent, and that’s when it’s justifiable to press the report button."
"Check your facts matey, This is on the latest FTA from gov.uk ""You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements."""
2 rows in front and 2 rows behind the positive case on the aircraft.
"I am not prepared to take the chance. Dont want to sit on a plane for 4 hours with a mask on even in Club and have no proper food or free drinks, surround by probably contaminated structures and air supposedly Hepa filtered. What a joke, having worked in the airline industry for over 40 years with intimate knowledge of maintenance I can assure you that it is not possible to do a sterile turnaround an A-320 in less than 1 hour let alone a A-380 . Even using fogging canisters each table and seat will need to be steralised. And as for Hepa filters, dont make me laugh! Big job changing them, takes more than 45 minutes.Anyhow, each to there own."
"I have an annual travel policy with Insure and go. They contacted me recently to say that my current policy now DOES include virus coverage!I can't see that whatever class for are flying bares any relevance to anything. You either choose to go or you don't !Just because you choose not to go, doesn't give you the right to berate and rant against anyone who does choose to go !"
I think it is completely up to individuals whether they travel or not...no problem... but please all remember just how quickly - literally overnight that Government advice can change. This whole thing has really been a roller coaster and I can't see how anyone at the moment can say that certain advice will stay in force until a certain date. All this could change in the flick of a switch and it is up to individuals to measure the possible risks and make a decision for them based on their own individual circumstances. This is a worldwide pandemic and a lot of people have had a really rubbish time and would love a holiday - measured risks....
"Hi JennyaI’m not sure if “I can't see how anyone at the moment can say that certain advice will stay in force until a certain date.” refers to my post #98.If it does, it’s not advice but the Greek Governments current entry requirements and protocols and it is they who stated that they will apply until 31 August.Neither they or I have suggested that they won’t be amended meanwhile. On the contrary it’s been announced that from tomorrow arrivals from some Baltic countries will be required to have had tests 72 hours before arrival.The poster I was replying to was meant to travel in September and had misquoted the current situation.JustMeHerandtheDogIt’s usual for someone’s first post on the forum to be greeted with a ‘welcome to the forum’ message and I’m sorry that was overlooked in your case. However you presented ‘facts’ in quite an aggressive way and the ‘facts’ are totally incorrect as many regulars on here have pointed out.I’m not sure who you were referring to as Matey but that too is quite aggressive and inappropriate.You now quote from the UK Governments advice but how on earth have you interpreted “you may be subject to further quarantine......” to mean that “ALL PASSENGERS WILL BE LOCKED DOWN” ?That could be thousands on a ferry, hundreds on a flight!"
"Im intrigued to know who had my #107 removed !My comments were no different to the other recent posts on this thread and if anything, gave some useful info about travel insurance !"
"Hi Fiscardofan no not being argumentative in any way - apologies if it read like that. I work in a school and have suffered from changing advice on a daily basis... I suppose I was trying to articulate that I think we need to respect each others decision whether to travel or not but to realise that things can really change on an almost daily basis. I think a lot of people think that travel and life etc is returning to ""normal"" and I really don't think that is the case. But then I am risk adverse and so act accordingly Ha"
"No apology necessary Jennya, you’ve never been argumentative.Just thought perhaps there was some confusion and enough of that’s circulating as it is!Let’s hope things are more settled for next year, meanwhile take care.Regards."
"Sitting here in Greece right now - another friend and their family set off on their first ever island hop today, and have said the same thing - I’m just so glad that we came. Yes, travelling is more stressful than usual. But when you get here, it all just melts away. It really does. I can’t emphasise that enough to anyone wavering about travelling. My thoughts go out to “...her and the dog”. Any trips at home will surely less safe than a holiday in Greece. Mike"
Re 113#- don't forget the weather in Greece. Another huge benefit.Your post has just confirmed my resolve to travel there as soon as possibly. Hopefully September.
"Hi Jennya70,Thanks for a reasonably stated argument against taking a holiday in the current circumstances.You write "" I think we need to respect each others decision whether to travel or not"".I couldn't agree more! I respect the fact that many do not wish to travel at the moment and that others cannot bear the thought of missing out on a holiday.What I object to is the way some come onto this forum and preach at members, putting them down because they choose to visit Kefalonia this year.This is a travel forum, not a no-travel forum."
"Thanks Bigcol....although risk adverse I would so love to be in Kefalonia this Summer. I have resorted to searching for Mythos in shops, watching youtube clips and cooking Greek recipes that obviously never taste as good!! Roll on a more settled 2021 Summer....."
"Thats correct, if you read the full document plus the documents issued by the Greek government specify the conditions of quarantine if a passenger had tested positive. . Random testing of persons in a vulnerable group on arrival. registration 48 hours before travel to obtain Q code, etc etc. And I consider the tone of my reply just matched the Somewhat aggressive call out of the poster. Of course it’s very possible that the situation worldwide will be worse next year as more and more asymptomatic people move around the planet I wonder if those with such a devil may care attitude would feel the same if they had witnessed a victim of the virus first hand? Probably not. It’s the same attitude some have to drink drive, unprotected social contact, incorrect wearing of face coverings etc. My immediate neighbour was having social gatherings back in April for example and she is a teacher. . Bournmouth beach et al. Anyhow end of posting. Better things to do.Edited: 5:30 am, July 28, 2020 "
"Hi guys,I just read the latest comments to see how Kefalonia is currently in terms of number of tourists and the facilities. Unfortunately didnt see many. Hopefully, we will be traveling next week so once I am there, can share few of my observations on the measurements for Covid.."
"Hi, I'm flying with Easyjet to Kefalonia in Oct and have been following this thread, but I have a different question that I don't think anyone has asked. Which is that tourists must complete a Passenger Locator Form before arriving on the island but I am slightly worried that the accompanying QR code is only sent by email one day before you are due to arrive. Has anyone had any problems with not receiving the QR code in time?Ian"
"Hi Ian. The current requirement to complete a PLF prior to travelling to Greece is in force until the end of August, when it will be reviewed. I can’t imagine that it will be discontinued though. After submitting a PLF, an acknowledgement is received and it’s important to keep this handy when travelling, should the QR code be delayed, as it proves that you have applied for it. I have read on other threads that the scenario you describe has happened. It means that you would be more likely to be tested. However, my concern now would be that some airlines have refused boarding to passengers without a QR code so every effort should be made to ensure you have one. It arrives at/just after midnight Greek time on the actual day of travel, not one day before."
Thanks very much for this information. I'll certainly make sure I have completed the PLF in good time.
Just to add the post arrives 22.00 uk time & is best displayed as screenshot on mobile
"In terms of the PLF, is it okay if you don’t have the zip code for the accommodation? I’ve put the name of apartments and resort so I’m hoping this is enough? Thanks"
You can look up the zip code online.Where are you staying?
28100 works for all of Kefalonia
"Hi cruiser & welcome, where are you staying?"
Thank you : ) Panorama Village
"Just returned from beautiful Kefalonia, felt perfectly safe on the aircraft, best flight ever!!! , stayed in Corfu overnight, ferry next morning to Igoumenitsa, 3 hour car ride to Patras, then onto 3 hour ferry ride to Sami. They will do random checks at airport and mandatory trace and track forms for the ferries. I had a wonderful time and kept up with advise whilst there, be sensible and you’ll have a great time, safe travels all"
"Hi Cruiser,Zip Code: 28100Street: LassiTown: Argostoli"
Is cephalonia safe to visit
Very few cases of COVID in Kefalonia Patricia and my family and I are currently enjoying a fantastic week on this beautiful island. Feels very safe. Covid measures in place of course but nothing to spoil your holiday. We have no regrets about booking a week away here.
If our flight lands at 22.20 pm Greek time when should we get the QR code through please ?
"Hi manilow, you will get QR code at approx 22.01 the night b4 you travel"
"But don’t worry if your QR code doesn’t come through bang on time, others have reported receiving theirs a little later."
