I have a trip coming up. Heard no international flights are allowed. Anyone knows till when? Thank you and take care everyone!
"Undoubtedly three months, could easily be six."
Someone i know who works in Agadir airport said they had instructions to be ready so i assume it could open anytime in June.
"My understanding is that there are tentative plans to open the national airports during late June in the least affected regions, but not for incoming international travel.I don't believe the government has even suggested a range of dates for the resumption of tourism. One date which might have some bearing is 15 July. This is when Operation Marhaba normally starts—the welcoming of ex-pat Moroccans back to their home country for summer holidays. But this is mainly a driving overland/ferry operation rather than air.Edited: 1:48 pm, May 28, 2020 "
