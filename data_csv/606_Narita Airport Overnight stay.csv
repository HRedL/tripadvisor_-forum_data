Is it possible to stay three nights in Narita airport transit. If there is Special arrangement now dueto covid-19 issue.
Try to fly direct to your destination.
"A three day gap between flights?? That sounds a bit odd. Not sure you would be allowed to do international transit that long, but spending three days in the departure area would be a special kind of torture.In any event, it is unlikely the airline would issue you you boarding pass/seat assignment, or manage your luggage for three days. Probably they are expecting you would pass through immigration (and into quarantine) before getting the second flight."
"You're not allowed to stay in the airside at NRT overnight, let alone 3 days. You'll need to find some other flights."
