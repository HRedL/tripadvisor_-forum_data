Thanks Cat!
Similar to what we have seen from other groups. Still showing same opening dates as previously. Likely to change obviously.
"Thanks Cat S. I knew they would have a safe, but unobtrusive approach. For me. the key is prevention when the guest enters. Similiar temp checks and questioning measures were taken during H1N1. They were completed at CUN airport. Imagine how reassuring to have it done at airport and resort."
who in their right mind would go now ...?
"I guess it boils down to personal tolerance. If you give yourself a Covid Test before you leave home, and/or some type of Health Passport is in place, AND you have taken your temp before you leave, I don't see a problem. I didn't feel it was problematic traveling during H1N1 either. I fear asymptomatic guests the most. I am willing to accept prevention and social distancing(keeping in mind groups are allowed to be kept together) before wearing a mask and gloves on the resort. I am not willing to have staff with a clicker counter to have limits on number of guests in a pool. I have to social distance to pick up medication. It is the new normal."
A group of us are going this Nov and I’m happy omg to see AMR Covid precautions they are putting in place
"Note that should they re-open in August or sooner, those rules may have changed by then."
What kind of Covid test can you give yourself before you leave home? Tests have to be sent to a laboratory as far as I know & take several days to come back. It could come back negative but you could have caught the virus whilst waiting for the results. .Checking temperatures at the airport will be ok but what if you have paid thousands for your holiday & aren’t allowed to travel & even worse you have a high temperature at a foreign airport & aren’t allowed on the aircraft. Can you afford to pay for another two weeks at the resort & possibly take two weeks unpaid leave as well? Depending which country you live in you may also have to take another two weeks unpaid leave to quarantine yourself when you get back home. I love my holidays but travelling this year is just too much of a risk imo.
"Each will have a different tolerance to risk and measures in order to travel or not. It is a personal choice. Most will likely wait until things are ""safer"", some may decide to travel regardless and even wear a mask at the resort. Again, personal choice."
