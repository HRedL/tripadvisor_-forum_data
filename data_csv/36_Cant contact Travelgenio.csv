"Hi there,I cant get through to travelgenio at all anymore. I have called and waited on the line for a total of about 4 hours now, and every single time now, the calls drop. I have gone on their website, made a request, haven't received any reply whatsoever, and there has been no feedback.We are trying to get a refund for our tickets (we booked on the 11th of November) since the area where we were supposed to travel to is now under lockdown because of the government's rules. Therefore the situation is out of our hands.I am waiting for a response from travelgenio, but if anyone has any help/advice, please let me know.Thanks!"
"Look down. Many threads with the same question. You gave your money to a bad company. Why did you pick them?Edited: 5:04 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Thanks for that. I do know that there are many threads with the same question. I too, can read. I have asked for ""Helpful"" information, so, if you don't have any, please don't waste your precious time in letting me know what I ""could have"" done, let me know what I can do now, going forward.Thanks!"
"Going forward then, you’ll just need to keep trying to contact them."
"""Helpful information""? OK here goes.Unless you are travelling this week, stop trying to contact Travelgenio for now. You will be dealt with. Eventually."
>> We are trying to get a refund for our tickets <<firstly I would have a look at the airline website. If your flight is not cancelled you need to see what waivers the airline are offering. In many cases this is a reschedule without change fees or possibly a travel voucher for future travel. Few airlines are offering refunds for non-cancelled flights.Travelgenio can only pass on what the airline gives them. No point asking them for a refund if the airline are not giving themIf airline not refunding you probably want to be looking at your travel insurance documentation to see whether you may be able to get a refund that way.
Helpful info: research before you give your hard earned money away to bad companies
"Every travel-related office and call centre, anywhere in the world, is in meltdown right now. Have some realistic expectations about the level of service you are likely to get from a cr@ppy outfit like Travelgenio."
"Thanks, I appreciate this :)"
"Thanks Carol! We were using Emirates, but they haven't cancelled the flights as of now, even though the area where we were planning on flying to is under lockdown, including the issuing of visas, so I think I'll wait and see if they can be of any assistance as well. Thanks again!"
"Hello Victor. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking and your doubts so we can review your case and give you an answer? Thank you, regards."
I have already sent an email to that customer service address. My ticket number is #3351101
Thank you Victor. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days.

Thanks I'll be waiting for The contact.
I also have the same problem. My transaction was failed but my balance was already deducted. Booking code 17830778Be careful. It's a SCAM. They are collecting it again and again.
"Hi Yogi, you will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days. Best regards."
Called so many times in the past two weeks and filled in the web form for a call back but nothing has happened since 6 March.I would like a response from them regarding my cancelled flights that I wasn't notified of and of the current travel restrictions.Full refund please due to a lack of customer service and transparancy.Booking Code: MU4NL5.
">> my flight is on saturday. I want to cancel and get a refund <<whilst you wait on your callback, you may want to check what the airline is offering if the flight is still operating. Very few airlines are giving refunds unless the actual flight is cancelled, it may be a change fee waiver or possibly a future travel voucher.You may decide (assuming that your policy covers your situation) to claim via travel insurance if the airline is not issuing refundsTravelgenio is an intermediary in the transaction, they gave your money to the airline and can only refund if the airline gives it back."
Thank you for contacting us Karin. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days. Best regards
"When i can get the answer? My flight is on saturday, i need to know the answer."
"Hi Frescious, one of our agents will contact you shortly. Thank you, regards."
I have been trying to contact Travelgenio about changing my booking details and multiple times filled in the form and tried to ring the customer service but everytime I have been cut off. I need an agent from Travelgenio to contact me ASAP. The airline is offering a change of flight but I can't speak to an agent.Booking code: THGQEPI live in UAE and need someone to contact me ASAP
"Travelgenio has rotten service at normal times, and now is far from normal. The call centre will be overwhelmed, and you will be lucky to get a response in the next week,"
Thank you for contacting us PeteErrigal. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days.
"Hi I receive information from you that about refund I should contact directly with JAL becouse they're the owner of the ticket but they send me to you beciuse you was a part responsible for payment process so you're supposed to refund money for my cancelation due to closed border, changes in Japan visas policy and JAL refund policy due to COVID-19. I send you an e-mail with information that I received from JAL so expect you to sreturn y money."
"Hi Aneta, thanks for your email and info. One of our agents will contact you in the next few days. Best regards."
"No one has gotten back to me ""in the next few days"". I have repeatedly tried to contact Travelgenio via phone and email, and still nothing. Not pleased at all."
If they haven't gone out of business by now they will soon be out of business. Unless you have some new information to add there is not point in new posts about Travelgenio
"Hello Victor, please tell us your booking number and we check it and contact you in the next few days. Best regards."
This is all the info:Travelgenio code for this booking: 16502889 Booking code: QMTX6UI will be waiting for an agent to contact me. I have already provided my phone number to travelgenio twice with the online forms.
"If Travelgenio has indeed gone out of business, which would be wonderful, it would be really nice if someone could strangle that annoying bot."
"I have also tried contacting travelgenio, have rung all phone numbers around the world and none of them work. i have sent many emails going back 2 weeks and no reply. They seem like a shady company"
"Hi Victor, you will receive a reply by mail during next week. Regards"
"Hi Tony, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Please contact us via customer.service@travelgenio.com if you have not done so, write your booking code and flight date in the subject line, and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
Thanks for your reply. The emails i send keep bouncing back.
Tony.You have been answered by a Bot. It is their new stock reply!There are no humans from Travelgenio reading the posts on this forum.I'm not surprised your emails are pinging back!Travelgenio are bad at the best of times. Now they are sinking under the weight of circumstances!
"I guess bots don't catch COVID-19, because i's been extremely busy over the last few days. Obviously hat's a reflection of just how many people are trying o contact Travelgenio here, and that is just the tip of a huge iceberg."
"Tony., please check there is not a mispelling: customer.service@travelgenio.com. We are receiving mails without incidence"
"Roj.Maybe, just maybe....they might fold under the weight of this?"
"Hi travelgenio,The airlines we were supposed to fly with has finally suspended their flights to where we had booked our tickets to.My ticket number is 3477147. Please contact me as soon as possible (I have been waiting a few weeks to be contacted) as now it is the airlines that have cancelled it and not us. We are requesting a full refund and your assistance as soon as possible.Kind regards,Victor D'Cunha"
>> We are requesting a full refund <<you need to note that a third party cannot give you more than the airline are giving.Emirates are not offering refunds (rightly or wrongly) it is rebooking or voucherhttps:/…3515
Thank you for contacting us Victor. One of our agents will contact you within the next few days. Regards.
"Hi Travelgenio, You have been saying this exact thing throughout the post and no one has contacted me. The airlines that I booked with has cancelled the flights and the booking completely and I am still not getting any customer service from Travelgenio. Not pleased at all.Regards,Victor D'Cunha"

"You picked a bad company to give your money to, Brian. We have threads here going back quite a few years warning travelers away from them.Suggest you document your attempts to reach them and file a dispute with your credit card company, or be prepared to wait for many weeks/months to hear from them. They have bad customer service in normal times. Now they have tens of thousands of folks all looking for refunds now"
Sorry Brian but all that will happen for your efforts is a bog standard stock reply from the Travelgenio bot.You will then have to send all the details to them again.
"Brian, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Hi,I did as said and I recieved an email with a new link seperate to the normal on the website I left my flight booking and recieved another email from your company stating another issue is this some kind of never ending loop?Regards"
"Eric, once you receive first link you are sent to a platform where you register your petition. Thanks for following all the steps in order to register it correctly. Regards"
I also have not receive any reply from Travelgenio yet.I would like to cancel my bookings and wanna know the refund status.I already requested many times from the form but no reply....Please let me know the refund status.

Travelgenio won’t reply to me either despite sending them several emails!! If any of the Travelgenio employees see this can you please message me on this regarding the airline canceling my flight? Thanks.
"Rosie: They will tell you to email them at the address listed in the prior post and then you won't hear from them again.We have had 2 posters claim they got refunds from TG. that's out of over 1000 folks who have posted here complaining about them.They have been a terrible company based on posts here for many years, and that's during normal times. I expect if you are made whole or even partially compensated it will be many months from now"
"Hi Rosie, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
I already requested many times from the form but no reply. Please reply me about my refund. I need to booking new flight soon.
"Châu G - this is a public chat forum not TG's customer service dept . However, I think that most of the posters on here would agree that you need to amend your expectations drastically about seeing any refund any time soon You should certainly not rely on getting any response from TG in time to book new flights if your travel dates are imminent and in all likelihood you will not be offered a cash refund anywayWhen was your flight due to operate and when exactly were you told it had been cancelled by the airline? Most airlines are only cancelling flights a week or so before departure dateEdit - I just noticed your earlier post which said your flights are not until July - I would be highly surprised if the airline HAD cancelled that far ahead - who are you flying with?Edited: 2:43 pm, April 28, 2020 "
"Even if the Travelgenio bot replies here, i don't think it will make much of a difference. Things will take as long as they take.I don't know whether TG are still prioritising flights within the next 72 hours, but I would assume that they are still working by flight date."
"Châu G: DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANYWe have thousands of complaints here.I hope you get your money back from them for past purchases, but I doubt you will. Do not throw good money after bad. STAY AWAY"
"Hi. My flight is on 1/6/2020. I have booked tickets since January 1, 2020. After I checked the booking code on the Vietnamairline's homepage, I could not find the ticket. I contacted the airline directly. Their answer is a refund for Travelgenio. And they told me to contact Travelgenio to ask about the refund."
"Good luck, Chau. We have had thousands of posts here complaining about them. 2 people have reported getting money back.You picked a terrible company to use. We have been warning about them for YEARS!! Did you research them before you gave them your money?"
"Hi Châu G, if you send us a mail to the provided address following all the mentioned steps you will receive a link whith all the instructions to register your querie in order to get contacted. Regards"
"Travelgenio has been promising me a refund since January, which they promised would be in in less then 10 days that was 3 months ago!!! called multiple times and emailed so many times and can not get through ... getting TIRED of this ! Booking reference: MZF5O5"
"Have been promised by travelgenio to be refunded money since January! They said it would be in my account in 10 days ... well it's NOT...Have sent countless emails to the email address they are posting, called multiple times without an answer, no RESPONSE... getting TIRED of this . Booking reference: MZF5O5"
"Sorry Mads, but 10 days is very optimistic for a third party even before the virus caused huge problems with illness, isolation and lock down of staff.They have to get the refund from the airline first, then they have to process it back to you. This may have been done, and TG have overlooked it, or they may never have actually asked for the refund at all.Equally, it may have taken them a long time o actually request a refund, and the airline hasn't paid them yet. All we can say for sure at this point is that TG are not quick. Judging by what people have been saying for a long time, even in normal times refunds could take several months."
"Mads O, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase.Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"hi travelgenio,when I called several months ago, you confirmed that you had ALREADY RECEIVED the refund from the airline - Oman air and that's why it would be in my bank acct 10 days later.....I have already sent countless emails to that address and have never gotten a reply. This is even before all the virus began so there's not really a good excuse for ignoring me. more than one of your agents said it would be 7-10 days later because the money was already in your account. what is happening?"
"Mads, a quick question, was it yourself or the airline that cancelled your flight? If it was yourself and it was a non refundable ticket, this is what they normally sell, it’s very likely that the airline just refunded the taxes and that has been eaten up by Travelgenio’s charges. If it was the airline then you are due a full refund but again Travelgenio will deduct their costs.Hopefully it will be the latter and you at least get some money back."
"Mads O, We have informed you previously how to contact us to register your petition. Once done as you say, our agents will contact you as soon as the actual situation allows. Due to the actual amount of petitions, reply times have increased. Thanks"
"Dear Travelgenio I have been trying to reach you via email many timesand have not received any responses back. my booking is TTTHCG.(The airline has cancelled my flights already)Please answer my email and let on of your agents contact meBest Regards,Kanmanee"
"If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
