"Many countries now require all person arriving (from the USA) to perform covid-19 test w/in 72hrs of departure. With the new rule to have covid-19 test w/in 72hrs of departure to HK (from say USA), all passengers require to be tested negative for COVID-19 (with their HKID / Passport # printed on the test result, AND the HKID / Passport printed on the doctor's report). I called around for the Covid-19 test centers, they ALL said there's NO way the result will be ready w/in 72hrs (more like 6-10 business days!!! Not to mention they may not be able to include HKID / Passport number ON THE TEST RESULT document! That's ridiculous and is there anyone here who has done such test and successfully received the test result (w/ the HKID / Passport # on the document) w/in 72hrs prior to departure? (HKGOV also requires the clinic / hospital / doctor where you get your covid-19 test from to include a letter also stating the same thing (that you ddi you COVID19 on this day and that you are tested -'ve WITH your HKID / Passport # on)."
At this time foreigners (esp US residents) are not allowed into HK.
HKID holder...
"I cannot address the question of whether the doctor/clinic will include your HKID info on the report but I recently had a test, the results of which were delivered, as promised, within 24 hours. I did this because I was entering a 'surgery center' which was requiring that I be tested within 48 hours of entering the center and required me to self-isolate within those 48 hours.The test procedure was straight forward: I made an appointment, drove-up to an appointed location, was swabbed and drove off. The whole thing took 30 seconds. Message me for the info. There was a fee associated with this test -- something that isn't common for the state, county and city-sponsored tests.Contact them and see if they'll provide the info you need. Good luck."
"I thought HK only requires a mandatory 14 days quarantine, not a pre flight COVID test?"
"Yes....the Gov just added it not too long ago:https:/…high-risk-places.html""1: the test report in English or Chinese issued by a laboratory or healthcare institution bearing the name of the relevant traveller identical to that in his/her valid travel document to show that:the relevant traveller underwent a nucleic acid test for COVID-19, the sample for which was taken from the relevant traveller within 72 hours before the scheduled time of departure of the specified aircraft;the test conducted on the sample is a nucleic acid test for COVID-19; andthe result of the test is the relevant traveller was tested negative for COVID-19; and"""
OK I did not know about the test requirement.
"The text you cited doesn’t say HKID or PPT # have to be on, just the full name as it appears on documents.I would not expect California testing facilities to have forms fitting HK form formats."
"The question really is, is there any testing facility that can give OP a test result within 72 hrs?"
"Just heard from the local Chinese news that Chinese Hospital SF and Stanford Hospital both can get this test done for your travel document. You'll have to call and make an appointment of course, as hospitals are not allowing visitors. Cost varies between $200 to $600."
