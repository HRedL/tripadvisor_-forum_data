"This is important information, informing & affecting every potential traveller's decision.Please feel free to add any factual info, updates, changes etc that you think are appropriate, in order to help holiday-makers decide whether to travel to Crete this summer, & understand what their arrival will entail.https://travel.gov.gr/#/Click here for the obligatory PLF form: https://travel.gov.gr/#/form"
"Please note that the Greek Government has slightly softened its 'self-isolation' request for the first day at your destination - after pressure from airlines the request is now to restrict your movements as far as possible, while you await the test results."
"There are more discussions on the topic here: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…Without aiming to duplicate that, I felt it important information that should not be lost on deletion of the 'big' thread that went downhill. To have the facts in 1 place, solely about arrivals, will I hope, help travellers to Crete."
You’re right - it is important Steve - there was a lot of thoughtful information and advice on that thread (amongst a lot of unnecessary flippancy) to help people decide whether or not to travel and what would happen on arrival. I’m sure any updates/info will be shared here!
"Excellent thread, just what we need for posters to be able to make an informed decision."
"The PLF form is to be completed online, by 48 hours before your travel time. However, until 6th July you may complete it in paper form at the airport.It is important that you include the country from where you are starting your journey, & if that is the UK, your chances of being tested increase. & you must list any other countries you have recently visited/ are travelling through."
"From 4th July, Greece will be on the excempt list of the UK government's directive of no non-essential travel,ie Greece has been assessed as no longer presenting an unacceptably high risk to British people travelling abroadhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…HOWEVER, The Greek Government does not yet allow direct flights from the UK. The next review of this will take place Mid-July."
"28 new covid cases identified today in Greece, 13 of which were from positive tests from arrivals.These 13 will be taken to the designated 'quarantine hotel' in the area, where they will stay in a bedroom for 14 days.Food will be delivered outside the door, using all disposable plates, cutlery etc.Clean bedding etc will be provided in the same way.After 14 days, a further test will be performed, & they may leave once tested negative.Also for each of those 13 people, track & trace procedures will have started, to identify 'close contacts' who may also be quarantined for 7 days, then tested again.The Greek Government will incur these costs."
Any information on where they arrived at and departed from - or does that remain confidential?
"Greece's Tourism Minister, Haris Theocharis was in Chania today, at meetings regarding the start of the tourist season. He referred to the existing plan underlining “if we win this wager (the opening of tourism), if we do it with safety and prove to any potential tourist that there is safety in Greece as we have proved it all these months, then we will be able to consider the possible extension of the tourist period and to gain some of the lost time. Now is the time for us to cooperate to manage this opening in the best possible way”.He also characterised tourism rather esential in Greece in July as “it is a very crucial month for Greece to prove that it can do many things and do them right and to open its borders with safety. This will allow all to see they can spend their holidays in Greece and it would become the basis for the return of the tourists at the former levels, something that will come gradually”."
"I haven't seen that detail Deb. Someone earlier had published a list of all the positive cases found within arrivals these last 2 weeks, but I don't have that detail.If anyone does, they'd be welcome to post it."
Re Haris Theocharis’s statement - It’s not about proving to tourists there is safety in Greece - we know that!! Most are more worried about the potential for spending their holiday in quarantine! Was there any mention about the tourists who are having to spend their “holiday” in quarantine - or is that just considered “tough” - I’m getting more annoyed by this protocol by the day - as you can probably tell!
"I guess the Tourist Minister wants to keep to the 'good news' as much as he can, y'know how it is with governments !"
"The WHO today tells people around the world to 'wake up & join the battle', as this virus will not magically disappear. ""We must join the battle now. We need to stop this virus now, Countries face difficult choices but absolutely have to break the transmission chains,"" including adopting quarantine measures ""if there is no alternative,"" Mike Ryan stressed."
"Hope it's OK on this thread to try and seek clarification on the possible outcome if someone on your flight tests positive if selected for testing on arrival. I had read on the deleted thread - and possibly elsewhere - that passengers on a flight where someone else tests positive would/might (?) also have to isolate and need a negative test result before then being allowed to travel home. It also mentioned this on gov.uk for UK entry requirements into Greece.I have mentioned this to the owner of where we stay in Elounda - and she doesn't believe this to be the case. She understands that it's only those that test positive that will need to self-isolate.From what I've seen over the last 24/48 hours, this whole situation is rather fluid. Does anyone know what the actual position is at the moment?"
"#11, Deb's spot on as usual, Every man and his dog, Already know Greece have been Amazing in their control of Covid, but potential Tourists are Extremely worried about these Random tests at the Arrival Airports in Greece and the potential 14 day Quarantines, in a Small Bedroom in a Hotel. What about visitors that have only booked 7, 10, 11, 12, night holidays, they would ALL miss their flights home and with the Travel Agents reporting a massive surge in Flight bookings, how do these Visitors get home, if the Aircraft are all full. The Greek Government, though protecting their Citizens, are wanting the Tourist Euro and not interested in their Visitors Holiday experiences."
"Martin, of course this is the place to seek clarification.I can tell you that the official government stance is that you may be required to quarantine if you are selected as a 'close contact' of someone who tested positive. They have said they may select people from the same flight to isolate.At that point you would go to the 'quarantine hotel' for7 days then tested again. I think they are purposely not being too clear or prescriptive about the 'rules'."
"So this is the thread for clarification and yet the person who started it has just used the words in post 16 ""you may"" then ""they may"" and then ""I think"".....I wouldn't call any of that clarification at all. To be honest to say for clarification and then include the words ""I think"" is pretty conceited. It would be so helpful if posters could stick with facts rather than 'it may' 'they may' and 'I think' as all that does is cause confusion.Edited: 6:12 pm, July 03, 2020 "
"EXACTLY, Jock, found Zero Clarification , hope or encouragement, from that post or the Greek Government,"
The term 'they may ' is a direct quote from the government's statement.
"The term 'I think' was yours and given that your were saying that your post was clarification when in actual fact it was just speculation isn't helpful to anyone. Even quoting the term 'they may' and 'it may' no matter where you took the words from is hardly clarification.Edited: 6:41 pm, July 03, 2020 "

"SteveSitia - as you say, the government are obviously giving themselves room for manoeuvre with the wording they use!I find some of the remarks directed at you rather insulting and unkind when you are trying to help clarify what is a fluid situation - please be kind everyone!"
Oops ... I appear to have stirred up a hornets nest!My question WAS looking for any factual confirmation regarding the possibility of other passengers on a flight having to self-isolate when another passenger tested positive on arrival.When flying on easyJet I usually sit in rows 6 or 7. So would I need to self-isolate I’d someone in row 25 tested positive ... for example? Flights are already arriving in Greece and people are being tested. Is there a procedure to follow when someone tests positive - or are they making things up as they go?These are the things that travellers surely need to know. So ... I agree with Jock that comments based on guesswork don’t actually help the situation. If no one knows the answer - then best not to say anything at all. I appreciate people wanting to be helpful - but this information needs to be accurate. Hopefully we will get some answers soon.
As clearly stated in post #16 - the government are keeping their options open.
So as clear as mud then!
"As I said Martyn - it’s a fluid situation and as I believe you are not travelling for some time yet there is every chance that whatever the protocols are today, they will have changed by the time you travel anyway."
"""23 Martyn , Great post, Just now people/visitors only want Facts and precise information and don't want ifs or maybe. The Greek Government are now acting like Westminster, with not enough Clear and Direct Information and rules.One thing I have found in this Covid Crisis, is that people require Guidance and Rules that are Clear, Direct and issued in a manner, that requires hardly any Clarification, e.g. you understand the Rules easily.Before this Covid, I was never really a Nicola fan, but as our First Minister, she and her Advisors, have given Clear Direct information and won't be swayed away from their Plan's, that's a lesson for the Greek and Westminster Governments,"
"I might not be travelling until late September Deb R - but others will be and my question is as much about those travelling tomorrow ... next week ... as much as it is for me. Everyone needs to be clear as to what might happen to them if they travel and someone else tests positive. Yes, things might be fluid ... that doesn’t mean they can make it up as they go along. Have a policy for NOW ... that can change as and when more information is available on how things are working!"
"As SteveSitia correctly quoted, the Greek Government statement says, or said, ""may' in respect to isolating people of flights where a passenger tests positive. They did not say 'will' or 'will not'. I asked a question about that on 'the other topic', so it's nothing new.I know it's very early days for international flight arrivals in Crete, but is there any sense yet of how much the arrivals process is affected by the additional checks?"
"It would be wonderful for the new new process to be that clear, Martyn, but as of now it isn't.There will need to be flexibility - eg if many people from 1 flight test positive there is a higher likelihood they will call the whole flight into quarantine. If just 1 test is positive, less likely.Experience over the next 2 weeks should inform this further."

As Steve already mentioned Mike Ryan from the WHO made a statement. To see the whole statement which is about making your own choices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddefsWzxWjIReally interesting for this forum!
"Let's face it. Greece wants the tourist money without the risk of infection. Cake and eat it springs to mind. Why would anyone risk a family holiday to a destination where the family could be split up and one or more members placed in quarantine which is akin to a prison. They seriously expect UK holidaymakers to risk spending thousands with that prospect?Personally I would rather they outright ban the UK or allow us in without testing, like the rest of Europe. Then at least we can visit a country where we are welcomed reciprocally. This middle ground helps no-one, other than perhaps those with holiday homes who will be there for months.The wording on the Greek PLF site is appalling. There is mention that molecular tests taken 72 hours before might be accepted, subject to evaluation. What evaluation - at the airport, an internally by the greek gov? Where is the list of test types that will be accepted? This should have been done before they opened their borders for something so important.Personally I'm disgusted with the way the greek government are dealing with this. We have a child with special needs who would not be able to comply with an airport test, never mind the potential isolation. I'm also concerned about these reports of locals treating the English like lepers.If things don't change by the time we fly we will write off the holiday costs and go to Spain."
Eaglesrest2 - I echoed your sentiments on the now closed “Crete...now” thread - I don’t believe that Greece can have it both ways....
"Yet to see the form as the link does not seem to work for us yet. Personally am not bothered about a potential test on arrival. The current advice from the Tourism Minister is for us not to move around too much rather than strict isolation until the results come through. Social distancing should do it but more needs to be done at our end to prevent those who are potentially symptomatic from traveling. This change has come about because of pressure from the airlines. Its a little ambiguous but was planning on spending the day after arrival quietly anyway. If I had been confined to the hotel for 24 hours then where I was staying would not have made it an ordeal. Its got a pool, a bar and grounds to relax in. They also serve bar food. The current situation is constantly changing but at least there is a good chance that they will let us visit after July 15th so looking forward to my trip in September. The molecular tests are those who can prove that they have antibodies to the virus. I know people who have but the 72 hour requirement would be difficult as no one knows for sure."
#34. Eaglesrest2. I have nothing to add. Agree with every word you say
Phillip D - what about if your test result came back positive? Apparently 50% of those infected don’t realise they are and can be asymptomatic. You would have to spend the next 14 days in a quarantine hotel - you don’t mention how you would feel about that?
"One of the articles stated that it's 14 days or longer if after 14 days in quarantine you still test positive. It's WHO and CDC guidance to not release people from quarantine unless they test negative twice within space of 24 hours. Greece has either adopted the guidance exactly or developed some local version if they are doing only one test at the end.The problem with those end tests is that many people keep shedding the virus for longer than two weeks and the virus genetic material is detectable by RT-PCR tests. Some people test positive up to 6 weeks! And that is how long they stay in quarantine. Can you image that? There is a lot of ""small print"" regarding testing and quarantine no one in Greece will officially tell you about. You only find out when you do a great deal of digging on your own."
"I saw this in a Facebook group which refers to Rhodes, but may still be of interest.- All 500 tests conducted at the airport last Wednesday (1/7) came back negative according to local press. Same for Kos, 300 tests, all negative."
"#34 Eaglerest2, Agree with your Post 100%, Greece can't have it both ways, I have already, stated this before, My wife and I have followed the rules in Scotland, to the limit, only going out twice a week, to the Supermarket, wearing Masks and Gloves, but we could both have Covid, nobody really knows, when we go to Crete, we could, be playing Greece's game of Russian Roulette, when we arrive, no other Mediterranean Countries are putting their Guests/Visitors, through, this Extremely Worrying Ordeal."
phytochemical. If you have done that digging please let the rest of us know what is in the 'small print'.
"DarkBlueDundee. If you have been wearing gloves you haven't been following the rules to the limit. Medical advice is not to wear gloves but to wash hands regularly. Gloves lead to a false sense of security and can actually lead to more spread of the virus. I know it seems counter intuitive but it has been repeated many times.I would stress though that I'm not criticising you for the attempts you are making, simply pointing out the actual position."
"Sad news just reported in Crete today:""The first confirmed coronavirus case of a foreign tourist vising the island of Crete has been identified on Saturday. Health authorities are on alert.""It needed the help of local police to locate the woman who is in one of the hotels in the Hersonissos Municipality."
"#40 - that’s great to hear Keith but the way I see it is: 800 tests carried out at Rhodes and Kos airports - out of how many passengers? If that is 10% of arrivals that means 7200 tourists on those islands and maybe further afield that haven’t been tested - even at 20% that’s still leaves 3200.... it just seems to me to be an exercise in smoke and mirrors.....Steve - sad news indeed from Crete.Edited: 9:30 am, July 04, 2020 "
The last sentence seems to imply that she was difficult to find?
"The 'small print' relates to the specifics of the diagnostic test (RT-PCR) used to detect the virus RNA, practical experiences how long people test positive, and guidelines regarding quarantine adopted by a given country. None of it has been clearly communicated by Greece to potential visitors so perhaps you should ask the Greek government, not me, to clarify these issues for you? At the end of the day, you will be spending thousands of euros in their country so they should at least show some respect for you.My opinion is based on experiences in Poland (not tourists obviously, tourists are not tested and/or quarantined unless they fall ill while in Poland). The short summary is that I cancelled Greece because there is no way I'm willingly putting myself in that kind of situation.Edited: 9:31 am, July 04, 2020 "
#45 - sad news indeed :(Interested to know if any information comes out as to how the authorities subsequently deal with fellow travellers of the person that tested positive - and indeed anyone else she may have come into contact with in Hersonissos.
"Well in our own country you would have to self isolate as well. However, a little more comforting being at home rather than a thousand miles away"
"Sorry but what Greek governemnt is doing is really bad. They want tourists'money, but don't accept the risk that someone could be positive. At that point it would be better to let borders closed to tourists this year. Here in Italy, as you know, we had a really hard pandemic emergency, but we don't control and test and quarantine tourists entering the country. Note that I'm not ""nationalist"" at all, I'm trying to manage a trip In Greece and I'm not promoting Italy, but I find the measures of Greece hypocritical and inappropriate for an holiday, I think I will choose another country"
"#49@Yiassas Many times you have been the voice of reason. I agree with your every word.I hope that you will reach some ""brains"" or, at least, ears (in the absence of the first mentioned).Edited: 10:30 am, July 04, 2020 "
"#49 - as previously said - Greece can’t have it both ways - even with the figures mentioned above - that is 1100 arrivals not tested at one airport on one day. The testing protocol is not protecting the country and it’s people - it’s just a gesture. It’s a strategy that is likely to backfire on both economic and health fronts and yes, I am annoyed by the strategy because it neither protects the population nor encourages tourists (especially those with children) if they risk being quarantined on arrival whilst others who COULD be infected walk out of the airport to enjoy their holiday and potentially pass the virus on to the local population and other tourists.Edited: 10:35 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Health Minister Vasilis Kikilias today in Crete stressed that tourists must observe the security measures against corona virus. "" I wanted to beg, encourage and ask, as we Greeks have observed medical protocols these months, listened to the experts and we have undoubtedly achieved a very great success, to have a safe country, so must our tourists. After all, that's why they came here, because we are a beautiful country and Crete is a beautiful island, but because we are also a safe country"", noted Mr. KikiliasHe advised that health care improvements have been made, thanking the Stavros Niarchos Foundation for donation & support of the additional ICU beds created this year. & noted that more ICU beds are yet required ""At the end of the year we will have 25 more ICU beds in Crete"""
"Yiassas - I do get it and it appears from comments on here - including anero127, DarkBlueDundee, phytochemical, maggie m, eaglesrest2 that others also get it.Edited: 11:23 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Yes - you are right Yiassas - and some will bring the virus, some won’t, end of."
">>Health Minister...today in Crete stressed that... more ICU beds are yet required. At the end of the year we will have 25 more ICU beds in Crete""Now, I'm stressed too!!!Once again - follow the rules and recommendations of your governments."
"Thanks for your post, Yiassas. You said ""I understand it’s concerning for your holiday if it all goes the wrong way for you, but have some concern for the country & people most of you profess to love!""Quite.I've felt from the start that the Greek authorities, who at first did so well to protect the country and its people from Covid-19, would be very unwise to allow tourists in - certainly from countries that have failed to bring the virus under some level of control. (I say ""some level"" because we know that this insidious virus is going to be with us for some time: there is no such thing as fully ""under control""; and the danger isn't over anywhere.) I've also felt that I don't want to take the risk of being part of the problem for Greece, and that therefore I won't travel to Crete, although I long to, while the situation in the UK is as serious as it still is. The shilly-shallying around ""bridges"" and reciprocal agreements, and around the date when visitors from the UK are or aren't going to be allowed in, is deplorable. If the Greek government were really serious about wanting to prevent transmission, the UK would be on the list of countries whose citizens are not allowed in, along with the US and Brazil; and when the next review happens on 15 July, I hope that for the sake of the Greek and Cretan people, it will be.Of course measures to prevent transmission are necessary, but my heart sinks at the inadequate ones that are being put in place now to identify visitors who might be sources of infection; and I've fully agreed with Deb and others who have commented that the Greek government is trying to have it both ways. And while I have some sympathy for people who are concerned about the possibility of their long awaited, expensive holidays turning into the nightmare of quarantine, I agree with you that your not being able to visit your mother is more serious. I hope you'll be able to before too long. :o)"
"With the current low number of arrivals, Greece is able to test a very high proportion of arrivals. At present that seems to be around 1 in 3 which will certainly give a very good snapshop of the current situation. If they can continue with high percentage testing for a few weeks, and continue to have a very low positive test rate, it may encourage them to drop testing completely. Testing one or two from a flight would, in my opinion, not be worth doing.As has been said previously, on many forums (fora?), at some stage it is going to be necessary to allow things to return to something much closer to the old normal. We cannot go on like this forever. I'm not suggesting a timescale."
"To many if's but's and maybe's for my liking, the prospect of self isolating or at worst being refused entry onto your flight is NOT a holiday experience I'd be looking at,I'll be giving Crete a miss this year ,hopefully things will be better next year for everyone concerned"
"25 new cases in Greece today, 11 of which were 'imported' by travellers.Tiny numbers of course, compared to many other countries, but when the nations' case numbers have been this tiny, it is significant when very nearly half today have come in from abroad."
"Worrying indeed SteveSitia. We had already cancelled our holiday to Crete this year before information about testing came out. If we hadn't already cancelled, we would now. The risk, small as it is, of being caught up in a situation requiring isolation just wasn't something we were willing to risk.Crete will still be there next year, and hopefully we will be in Crete."
"As well as the 25 new ICU beds promised to Chania hospital later this year, there is going to be a molecular analyser arriving soon, so covid tests can be done in Chania."
"Greece MAY be ready to welcome British visitors from Mid - July.Not yet confirmed, but here is the Tourism Minister giving a clue that the long-suggested 15/7 date could happen. (report in English)chaniapost.eu/2020/…I have heard nothing to say at this point Greece is likely to stop their current protocol to test & quarantine positive cases on arrival. Do report to the thread if you see that as it will make a huge difference to the numbers of people who will risk a trip this year."
"It is hard to believe what nonsense the Greeks will do, prohibited risk (term of insurance). It would be absolutely logical to test every newcomer.Relying on common sense among those where such a thing has never been noticed or recorded is ""ab asino lanam"" and tantamount to temporary blindness. I say temporary because everyone will regain their sight due to the slap SmackDown that will inevitably follow. I am very sorry for the locals. Especially those who have nothing to do with all this lunacy. Compared to encountering some individuals, covid-19 is a blessing."
">>I have heard nothing to say at this point Greece is likely to stop their current protocol to test & quarantine positive cases on arrival. <<As far as I know the PLF is there to remain till (at least) 31 August. And as the testing is based on the data filled in on the PLF, it seems logical to me that the random testing will be there for the same period.And all of this assuming there is no new spike or 2nd wave before that time."
"Thanks Nicksy, exactly my understanding too.I was a little concerned that Brits who get excited by the thought of their flights coming soon might not know about that possibly devastating blow to their trip."
"I find the greek system for tourists'incoming very ambiguous. They permit to come, but randomly they can turn your holiday into a nightmare. I will travel with a couple of friends, we are families with younger kids, what will happen if one of our group would be found as positive (asynthomatic of course, everyone want to travel safely and healthy)? Maybe the greek government doesn't want to forgo money, but want to show they take adequate measures, but if tests are random is pretty unnecessary.Then I can see a total lack of reciprocity, the other UE countries don't make any test to greek people, two days ago I went to France without problems, and the same would be elsewhere, including UK.Last but not least, I know the person who will be tested is chosen by a software, and the barcode of PLF the traveller gets already contains the request. I think this should be declared to the person BEFORE the departure, in order to choose if leaving or not to Greece, and not at airport: that's not fair, and it seems a way to let people leave at any cost"
"People from the north of Italy and people from Crete, related to the perception of corona, have absolutely different optics. I'm surprised that you don't understand them. Remember Bergamo? Greeks should not forget that either and they certainly won't risk such a thing happening to them.I agree with you on ""loose"" precautions. They must be strict and also strictly respected.Edited: 9:54 am, July 05, 2020 "
"https:/…Check the message from David in the comments (David 3 July 2020 at 14:40), someone in his plane tested positive and now they are tracking the people in two front and back rows to put them in quarantine! So even if you get tested beforehand and it's negative, you still can get end up in quarantine! I was already hesitating to go to Crete with my family begin august because of these protocols, but this message took all the doubt away. I am cancelling!"
"Yes, his message should be compulsory reading for anyone thinking quarantine does not apply to them...There is one more important message buried in those comments: the definition of ""close contact"" (all the people they will be tracing and quarantining when someone tests positive)Close contact is defined as: --A person living in the same household as a COVID-19 case;--A person having had direct physical contact with a COVID-19 case (e.g. shaking hands);--A person having unprotected direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g. being coughed on, touching used paper tissues with a bare hand);--A person having had face-to-face contact with a COVID-19 case within 2 metres and > 15 minutes;--A person who was in a closed environment (e.g. classroom, meeting room, hospital waiting room, etc.) with a COVID-19 case for 15 minutes or more and at a distance of less than 2 metres;--A healthcare worker (HCW) or other person providing direct care for a COVID-19 case, or laboratory workers handling specimens from a COVID-19 case without recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) or with a possible breach of PPE;--A contact in an aircraft sitting within two seats (in any direction) of the COVID-19 case, travel companions or persons providing care, and crew members serving in the section of the aircraft where the index case was seated (if severity of symptoms or movement of the case indicate more extensive exposure, passengers seated in the entire section or all passengers on the aircraft may be considered close contacts).The epidemiological link to a probable or confirmed case may have occurred within a 14‐day period before the onset of illness in the suspected case under consideration.Edited: 10:21 am, July 05, 2020 "
"Thank you so much Wim D, very important & useful info.Here is an account of a family recently arrived in Crete, not tested on arrival but then called into the quarantine hotel as 2 people on their flight had tested positive.It appears - only from a comment - that at least 2 rows each side of the positive tested person have been quarantined. Also 30 people on that flight are mentioned.To read all comments; scroll to the bottom of this link:https:/…"
The Greece-Serbia borders have been closed due to the epidemiological situation in Serbia and given that many Serbian tourists have tested positive for corona.Serbia was 1 of the countries allowed to travel to Greece from 1/7.The situation will be reviewed again in mid July
"Thanks Phytochemical for copying the text, so although this is duplicated on other threads, I do feel it is important enough that we should do so. Below are the comments from a healthy family now in quarantine in Crete, as described in the above few posts:""David 3 July 2020 at 14:40 ReplyIf we knew it before, I had cancelled our trip to Chersonissos area. We arrived on 1st of July and everything went fine on arrival. After scanning our QR’s we were all directed to the baggage belt and proceeded to our rented house. Yesterday evening I received a phone call,that two passengers on the same flight have been tested positive and today a shuttle arrived for our mandatory relocation to a quarantine destination. We are now really p* because that means, that even if you are not a risk candidate with full health they can quarantine anybody at any time. Our host tried to help us because we rent the same house since over 10 years and during this time Mikos has become a real friend. He said, that he fullfills every condition from the greek government including a dedicated doctor, but he couldn’t assist us in any manner to avoid relocation. We are now trapped and I’d like to share our experience to other people. I understand the security concerns to protect the local people, but they should inform about all possible scenarios in advance. We thought everything is fine, if you can leave the airport directly but that’s sadly not true.""David 3 July 2020 at 19:33 ReplyI have heard that at about 30 passengers from my flight have been relocated.. Don’t know whether it’s true, but this might match if the two rows rule is correct. If that’s true, every positive tested passenger also puts the next two rows in front of him and also the two behind him in a really absurd situation.David 3 July 2020 at 19:40 ReplyIn a dedicated hotel nearby Heraklion. I have heard that there are also hotels in Lassithi and Chania to sit in. Sadly the Wi-Fi is not really working and my cellphone data volume is soon at zero. With some sarcasm I can say that the sit in is at least donated by the government"

Do you know where the David's flight came from?
"Thanks for the posts on this thread. Mostly informative.It really is a binary decision now. If the Greek protocol remains for UK travellers post 15/07 then we will not travel. That is 100% certain. I would hope our carrier, Jet2, would do the honourable thing and cancel all flights to Greece until the protocol changes, but if not we will lose our money than risk the alternative.I can understand the locals being apprehensive of UK visitors, but I know for a fact our friends in Crete will welcome us with open arms. Such a shame we could all suffer both financially and emotionally because of this test and trace protocol. Theo talks about reciprocity - I hope he understands what the word actually means and revokes the quarantine protocol for UK travellers, or just extends the ban until the end of August.Edited: 2:21 am, July 06, 2020 "
">>I would hope our carrier, Jet2, would do the honourable thing and cancel all flights to Greece until the protocol changes<<I can't see anything honourable in blackmail."
">>I would hope our carrier, Jet2, would do the honourable thing and cancel all flights to Greece until the protocol changes<<I can't see anything honourable in blackmail.Nicksy, who are you accusing of blackmail? Jet2 have treated passengers far better than most tour operators / airlines to date."
>>>I can't see anything honourable in blackmail.I don't see it as blackmail. By cancelling the flights they will be saving people from having their holidays turned into the nightmare of quarantine and financial loss. I wish Polish government would ban flights to Greece while this testing and quarantining is going on. That would allow people to get refunds or change their bookings without extra charges. The flights going to Greece are reportedly only 20-25% percent full anyway. Anyone who could already backed out of travelling to Greece. Those who are travelling are not waiting for their trips with the usual joyful anticipation.
Im probably in a minority of one but I think the Greek system is a good one.Its not the Greek Government causing this its the virus and they need to do all they can to protect their country and their visitors.Just allowing free travel as normal is reckless.We have loads of testing capacity now in the UK. Anyone travelling should be tested before travelling a few days before. It would reduce the risk slightly.Im more concerned about tourists developing a cough or symptoms and not getting tested and quarantined while abroad.The chance of being quarantined is minimal. But id rather be in quarantine than walk around spreading this virus.

"There is a really simple solution:1) allow free travel like the rest of the EU - its business as usual2) close the borders for all but essential travel3) implement an agreed protocol of test before flight with the proof of negative result shown at check-in, or uploaded with the the PLF. Do not test on arrival, and do not impose quarantine under any circumstances related to air travel.At least with option 3 the Greek government are not ruining holidays, don't have to fund testing or hotel stays, airport queueing will be reduced, everyone knows where they stand.There will be a small increased risk of transmission, but it's a more sensible approach IMO.Edited: 4:22 am, July 06, 2020 "
"Just wondering if this story from “David” is true? I can’t find the original post anywhere, just copy and pastes on different forums. We don’t know where the flight originated from and I can’t find this story in the press anywhere. Also, I can’t find any info from the official Greek site that says that you could be put into compulsory isolation if someone else on your flight tests positive. Not trying to stir up a hornets nest here but without any further evidence I’m really wondering if it’s true. I’m due to travel to Rhodes next week and am genuinely worried."
"There is also one more possible approach that would be fair4) since people are selected for testing 24h before arrival in Greece by an algorithm they should be informed whether they are selected when they get that QR code. Those who are selected would be free to make their own decision if they are going to risk it; those who are not selected would travel with peace of mind.Frankly, anything would be better than the random testing on arrival."
@eaglerest totally agree with you

We don’t know where the flight originated from and I can’t find this story in the press anywhereThere are two people being quarantined in Heronissos, there was story in one of the local media (I'll post a link when I find it).

Some questions which there may be no definitive answers on:- What are some of the criteria for the arrivals testing decision? i.e. - is it likely that everyone arriving indirectly from the UK are to be tested? Does it depend on age group? - What happens if you want to just go home in the case of testing positive? I wouldn't want to hang around that's for sure....- Is there somewhere to track the numbers of people being tested daily on arrival?
"Another 'imported' Corona virus case in Crete.A young German is the second case of coronavirus brought by a tourist into Crete. According to information, the young woman has already been transferred to the quarantine hotel in Hersonissos where she will remain in solitary confinement.Apparently investigations are underway to locate a friend of the 20-year-old with whom they traveled together to Crete."
"It's simple: If you have a problem with rules and protocols set by a country, don't go. It looks like most of the posters complaining are from a country that hasn't dealt pretty well with this pandemic and still has high figures in both infections and deathrate (even if they don't count all corona related deaths). When I've seen the images and pictures about the behaviour when the pubs were reopened, I hold my hart when I think that some (or a lot) of those irresponsible persons will be travelling around in the near future. Not only to Greece but also to other holiday destinations. If they can't even comply with some rules in their own country how can one expect they will follow (mostly more strict) rules in another country. Look at it from the Greek perspective. The whole country has made tremendous efforts and sacrifices to keep safe. Why should they take the risk of having a big spike in infections by not sticking to their current protocols?"
"Hi Jatt,The Greek Government have not, as far as I am aware, given exact details of how the algorithym works (can't say I blame them, it would make it easy for people to lie on their PLFs; just my opinion!). but their statements have said that people coming from countries with higher R ratings, such as the UK, are more likely to be tested. Age is another factor, I have read. & on the PLF you must list which countries you have visited over the last couple of weeks, that's another factor.Going home wouldn't be allowed, as you'd be at high risk to infect others on the flight. If you test positive, you don't have a choice but to go to the specified 'quarantine hotel', or stay in your own hotel room if that's not yet up & running, as happened a few days ago! After 14 days a further test is done & you may leave once you test negative. The Greek authorities are paying for the quarantine but you would have to make arrangements if you couldn't catch your booked flight home.I'd be interested if you do find a list of the no. of tests daily per airport, I haven't seen that as a regularly issued news item yet. The plan was for 275 at Chania & around 850 at Heraklio as a standard."

Jatt- I’m not sure if it works like that. I am pretty sure that you would be whisked off to a quarantine hotel if tested positive.

As far as I can tell just like a normal QR code.Let us know how your journey goes!

He added that Greece is among a handful of countries that ""continues to carry out targeted inspections on travelers."" """
"Damn :( Of 43 news cases today, 36 of them were from arrivals testing positive."
"Disappointing to see the quick increase, so hope it's not the start of an upward trend. Wouldn't it be wonderful for all of us if the numbers were zero."
What an awful thing to say Elaine p☹️
That’s very sad...as Yiassas says fingers crossed it’s a one off bad day :-(

Most of those arrivals were not tested....
"You have to also add their ""close contacts"" as per EODY's definition... That's a lot of people whose holidays are being ruined."
Just to clarify.The new cases. Greece as a whole or Crete?
#117The good news is they will be isolated and the Greek authorities can hopefully keep it in check.
36 tourists in Greece as a whole

Yeah cheers. Found an article now.
"So 18,000 out of 94,000 arrivals tested?"
36 cases as a percentage of 22000 arrivals is actually very low.
"OK, I read that of the 43 cases was it yesterday, that 36 came from the border at Bulgaria."
"paulaf - 22000 may have arrived but according to what has been posted on here, 6000 are tested - so you have 36 positives out of 6000 tested and 16000 arrivals not tested...."
This is all very concerning. Is anyone actually still planning on going on their holiday?Everyone seems to be cancelling.

"I haven't been following this thread but had a look earlier and so many posts were deleted by the ""community"" so I was struggling to follow it. Good to see the deleted posts reinstated as I can now make sense of the last few pages and all the posts made. (I tried to edit my earlier post but another post had been made so I couldn't edit)."
Here's an informative link ......atoz-guides.com/coronavirus-in-greece-update/ The vast majority of people testing positive came through the northern land border not at airports
Thanks for the link.
"According to https:/… 36 new CV19 cases were from border crossings from Bulgaria, as mentioned by #127 Paulaf.The same article says ""The data released daily by the Greek National Health Organization are not always complete and therefore kind of frustrating. For example, they release tests conducted at the airports only, while tests are being carried out also at the border-crossings, and there is often confusion with the tests.""which explains why numbers tested, numbers detected etc. are at odds.The argument seems to have moved on from the pious 'protect the poor Cretans, don't travel', to the selfish, 'I might be quarantined if I go, not acceptable!' We have had a flight booked since last October, with Easyjet 12th-25th July, now cancelled. We re-booked with BA 12-25th, then moved the outbound, for more money, to 17th after the extension to flight ban.So, we are going Friday week, 17th, unless BA scrub the flight for some reason. We have only 8 days now. Our various accommodations have been fantastic, moving dates, refunding, being extremely welcoming in all their responses. Are we worried we will be importing the virus? No, we're healthy, as are 99% of the rest of the UK population. Are we worried about quarantine?, No, tiny chances, if it happens, it happens, all part of life's rich manure. We are optimists and fatalists; life, meaningful life, has to continue. We cannot keep hiding from the virus or it has won, and, life or death, there'll be precious little future to look forward to.PS, I'll post when we get there, feel free to say 'I told you so' :)PPS. Kids are out of work now, I could be soon, might not be another chance (soz, not v. optimistic:)"
Okay I will make one more post on this thread for now but if I could I would make post 140 a sticky on the forum I would as it captures my thoughts far more succinctly than I could ever put them. I really hope you get there and so look forward to the feedback when you do.
"I think the risk is worth it. We had our honeymoon cancelled in May and my wife has been stuck at home throughout the long Welsh lockdown. I've been working in homeless hostels without a break since September. We have flights booked for the end of August and it seems to me that if there are any real problems they will be evident before then. So, for now, Sougia and Loutro flood my dreams. Stay safe and happy trails."
"Jonathan C brilliant post, BA have no reason in their control to cancel your flight, mine on 19th only has 2 seats left for sale, yes please can you post when you get there letting us all know how it went. Enjoy your holiday."
"UK has a population of 60 million of which currently 30k active cases. So, 1 in every 2000 people have active Covid in the UK.You take a flight to Greece with 200 other people, the probability a single passenger has is 10%, but less than this if they are asymptomatic. Let’s say Greece tests 1 in 10 (10%) of passengers, and then quarantines 20 (5 rows) out of 200 passengers, i.e. another 10%.So, if you don’t have Covid (1999 out of 2000), the chance of being quarantined because of another passenger has been tested ad positive for Covid is 10% x 10% x 10%, or 1 in 1000. This is likely to be highly conservative as most areas with Covid prevalence are socially deprived, and therefore unlikely to be taking flights to Greece. Also most cases will be symptomatic and therefore will not even board the plane when temperature checked.So, I’d say the chance of being quarantined in Greece will be one in several thousand, if not smaller than that if they apply the rule to less than 5 rows of the aircraft.So, stop worrying and crack on with your holidays. Someone will be quarantined, but 1in 5,000-10,000 is probably a tolerable risk."

">>>Someone will be quarantined, but 1 in 5,000-10,000 is probably a tolerable risk.You are looking at it from the wrong perspective. You should ask yourself the question ""what if it happens to ME?"" rather some anonymous ""someone"". Chance of winning the lottery is one in several millions yet lottery wins happen all the time and are life-changing experiences for multiple people. If you can image -being tracked by police and carted off to an unknown location by people in hazmat suits-being locked up in a room in a quarantine hotel for 2 weeks (or longer if you keep testing positive) -you can't go out of the hotel even for exercise-you can't just pack up and go home-you have to follow orders from the authorities or face fines of up to 5 thousand euros-you can't tell them to f*ck off-your embassy won't help you when the Greek state declares you a threat to public health-you lose all your bookings (hotel, car rental, etc)-you lose your flight home and have to buy a new one at the full walk up price -you face complications for being absent from work due to getting stuck in quarantine abroadIf you can image yourself in this kind of situation, and you are OK with all that, then there is no problem. Go."
"The experiences of the Romanian woman now in quarantine are amusing, but not to the authorities - she was tested in Heraklion on arrival, went to her hotel for the 'be careful, don't have contacts' 24 hours required. But her hotel was closed, so she booked into another, did not report the change of location to the test team then spent the next 72 hours travelling around Crete, whilst the authorities tried to find her as her test was positive. When asked why she'd gone exploring around the island, she said she hadn't wanted to spoil her holiday.The report concluded that eventually police presence 'convinced' her to go into quarantine!"
Why didn't they simply call her? They are collecting phone numbers on those locator forms
"Good morning everyone, I am a bit late to the party with this thread; I have skim read most of it but have to confess to skipping a few pages, as there is an awful lot here, very useful info.  We don't currently have a holiday booked but I do have a deposit with a villa near Almyrida and some cancelled Ryanair flight vouchers from a cancelled June trip. We are thinking to take a family holiday late August/early Sept as our two kids don't go back to school until 7th Sept. Our thinking was that we would isolate at home for 2 weeks before we head out (we work from home, can get shopping delivered etc), the transit arrangements in airports and on flights seem sensible, then we would be in a private villa with our own pool when we get there (I'm not suggesting we would want to avoid mixing with other people at all but we have the option if places seem crowded to be very comfortable at our accommodation). We have a pre-existing insurance policy that covers most eventualities. We had taken the likelihood of becoming unwell and ending up in quarantine to be very low (however some of the comments here about people being quarantined after others on their flight test positive have given me pause and we need to think about that). My main concern at the present is if my kids got randomly selected for the testing, they are 10 and 12 so not tiny but having read about the testing procedure, I think it would be pretty unpleasant for them. My 12 year old is (undiagnosed) on the autism spectrum and I think would find it very distressing and I can see us having to physically restrain them both to get it done which doesn't feel great... So I guess my question is (and it may not have an answer at the moment!) what would happen if they couldn't be tested because they physically resisted and is there any leeway around distressed kids? I completely get why the testing would be necessary, and I am not suggesting kids *should* be exempt, I am just trying to work out if this is something we would be prepared to take a chance or not, and if it might be something there is a little room for manouevre on or not... I know there will probably be some people who will say the kids should be ready to do as they're told but it can be a very primal reaction in them when they are frightened and uncomfortable... Thank you!"
">>Why didn't they simply call her?<<Who says they didn't. Maybe they called 100 times. But if she didn't answer because she didn't want to ""spoil her holiday"", it's back to square 1.Edited: 4:23 am, July 07, 2020 "
"""My main concern at the present is if my kids got randomly selected for the testing, they are 10 and 12 so not tiny but having read about the testing procedure, I think it would be pretty unpleasant for them.

I showed her the video of the test and she ran off crying. She is a very nervous flyer and would not comply to an airport test which would mean she would be taken away I guess, and that would be the end of the holiday. Insane. We did the only thing we could and cancelled and rebooked for another destination. If the protocol changes and becomes compatible with a family vacation, we shall return to Crete. We have family in the area and visit regularly.What people don't get on here, or anywhere, is perspective. They only see things through their own experiences. Accusations of people being selfish for not wanting to risk quarantine on holiday. I expect nothing less of people as has been exposed throughout this pandemic, but don't hold it against them. It's hard to consider all perspectives. If we did not have children we would probably get a test in the UK to prove we are negative then travel and take our chances. With children we cannot in good conscience do this. The risk is too high. They have been through enough with the lock-down, being away from school and friends for months. Even if the odds are stacked in our favour, the intense worry would replace the usual excitement. I know Greece will be around for many years, I fear that some of the businesses we know and love will not."
Unfortunately this topic seems to be moving the same way that so many have gone. Should we go or shouldn't we? Are we being selfish if we do/don't go?..... There is no right or wrong answer to these or the many other similar questions which have been asked. It's entirely down to the individual to see how THEY feel about the current situation and make what they believe to be the best decision for THEM.

You should also remember that the chances of your family being tested, since you come from the UK, are probably considerably higher than the average: I believe the algorithm is taking provenance into account.Since you know that your children would be distressed, and might need to be restrained, it sounds to me like a risk too far - but of course only you can decide that."
"Many of our concerns are also echoed here. We visit Crete every summer and are due out this year at the end of July for 4 weeks - we have our own self contained property and were planning to pretty much self isolate at home for two weeks before we came so that we knew were as ‘safe’ as we could be. If we were travelling alone it might be different but we have two children (6 and 10) and know that our 6 year old would really struggle if selected for random testing. On that note, does anyone know if they conduct the nasal swab or the mouth one? On top of that, the fact that it now appears that we wouldn’t be able to isolate at our own property, and that we could potentially be quarantined in a hotel room simply because we ended up sitting close to someone on the plane that subsequently tests positive, means that unfortunately it looks like we won’t be coming. As flights can now resume from 15th it also probably means that we’ll lose our money as I don’t see Ryanair cancelling now that they’ve been given the go ahead to fly. However, the thought of a minimum 14 days quarantine in a hotel room in Chania with two youngish children means that we have no real choice. I understand Greece wants to keep its COVID cases down, however, I think that a lot of people that are planning on travelling are not aware of the situation that potentially awaits them. I think this needs to be made much clearer so that people can make more informed decisions before they travel."
"Em69:I believe it will be the nasal and throat swabs. Not the deep nasal one, based on videos I have seen."
Thank you!
"Yiassas, that's interesting - and strange, since one of the things that is known about Covid-19 is that children, though they rarely show symptoms, can, if they've been exposed to the virus, be carriers. It wouldn't make sense not to test them. (But then, so much of what's happening makes no sense!) It would be very helpful if you could confirm it one way or another: the answer might mean that Allison and Em59 and doubtless many others would have one less thing to worry about."
"If you could confirm , that would be great. I scoured the PLF website and there is no information. Also submitted a query to Visit Greece- no reply."
I read that from July 9 to August 31 th PLF form can be completed 24 hrs before your flight as opposed to 48 hrs previously. Its in the greek press today
"Thank you for the replies, Yiassas, that would be really helpful to know if it would be the adult selected for testing. I think over the course of the morning (I only found out about the testing situation last night!) I have come around to: this is not something I would personally put my kids through (based entirely on my knowledge of my own kids and not to judge what anyone else would decide). But I would be happy if we knew it would only be an adult selected... then we would just have to think about the possibility for getting quarantined if someone on the plane tested positive, though I guess that could happen anywhere if someone on your flight developed symptoms...?? Thanks again."
"Re post 146 >>>you face complications for being absent from work due to getting stuck in quarantine abroad<<<I doubt any employer would want someone back at work while they were still testing positive, so they would have to quarantine wherever they were. Obviously, finding out that one's Covid +ve before one travels and having the option to quarantine at home would be preferable option!"
A pre holiday test would be ideal but in England at least you cannot access a test without having symptoms. I suppose you could lie of course
Unless youre a key worker etc etc
"Can anyone confirm how, in the worst case scenario, quarantine would work? We will be travelling as a family of 4, but with adult children of 18 & 20. In the event that one of us (or someone close on the plane) tested positive, would all 4 of us be quarantined and would this be in the same hotel room? My understanding is that the Greek Govt. pay for the hotel, but that the individual would be required to sort their own flights back to the UK (given that quarantine is for 14 days, we would miss our scheduled flight back). I would be concerned if there was a chance that my son or daughter were quarantined on their own and had to arrange flights and fly home on their own."
You can buy testing kits online for about £100pp... I am not keen to spend £400 to test the whole family personally but the option is there...
"I can confirm that they test children too at Athens airport, even very small ones, toddlers. Does someone no, do they contact the tested person if the test is negative?"
If you have a child and are not prepared for them to be tested or they wont allow themselves to be tested then sorry dont leave the UK and stay home.Here child gets a cough/sore throat. Stay home for 14 days.Abroad they come down with symptoms what are you going to do? Get a test and isolate while you wait for a result.? Hopefully negative carry on with holiday.Or Its probably a cold carry on as normal dont tell anyone but possibly put lives at risk.?This of course doesnt just appply children. Everyone travelling abroad should be prepared for a test and be prepared for the same isolation process as at home.Ive no problem with the Greek Testing system. The huge majority travelling will be fine.
Thanks Alison. I'll have a look
"I decided to message my hotel in Greece (which is open) to ask them a few questions in the hope they would know a bit more with actually living in Greece and one of the questions I asked was regarding children being tested at the airport, as I'm worried about mine, and they said anyone can get tested as it's random testing. So unfortunately yes it's a possibility."
Paul blues.. I dont have a problem with the testing per se. But I would not be best pleased if my holiday was ruined because Joe Bloggs 2 rows back tested positive.
">>>I doubt any employer would want someone back at work while they were still testing positive, so they would have to quarantine wherever they were.That's not what I had in mind. In Poland many employers effectively blacklisted Greece and other countries which test people with no symptoms so that their employees can get stuck in quarantines for unpredictable periods of time. They will not be paid and may face other consequences."
#167 - my understanding is that if just one out of your 4 tests are positive it's your choice if just the one person who is positive quarantines on their own or with 1 other or 2 others or all 4 of you. This is based on a family with children. As your children strictly speaking are adults I'm not sure if this will still apply but I'd be incredibly surprised if they didn't at least let one extra person be with them.
"I don't think, that they will insist to test kid with autism spectre (idk if they will ask for ""proof"" document, though)Just say it and they will probably will take You or partner of yours"
I work in the NHS and the policy at our Trust for those staff testing positive is:If asymptomatic or mild symptons then only 7 days off and back to work.
"The rules in the UK seem to be more relaxed than in Greece, and this is probably why so many UK posters fail to grasp the severity of the random testing and quarantine issue."
"Post 170 - I absolutely would have no problem getting my kid tested if I tested positive or if they had symptoms. I certainly wouldn't pretend we are well if we are not. One of the issues we have looked into thoroughly is the possibility of ending up in quarantine but I mostly feel I have all the info I need to help me make that final decision as to whether that's a risk we are prepared to run - our insurance covers us for this as well as the backup from the Greek government; I'm self employed and my husband has a reasonable employer and the ability to work remotely so the small possible chance of that happening feels ok-ish. I also don't disagree with the testing approach, I'm surprised (or am I really!) that more places are not doing similar. Absolutely the point of my original question is to decide whether the possibility of a test and the impact it might have on the kids is a deal breaker. If I don't want them to have to have it we will of course stay at home - but that's what we are trying to decide, and the information people are sharing here is very helpful in approaching that decision. We like presumably most other people are trying to weigh up the likelihood of various things happening against their impact and see what we can put in place to mitigate some of it. The ultimate decision will either be to go or not go, but we're not quite there yet..."
"We are due to visit Crete in Mid August which is still about 5 weeks away, a lot can happen in 5 weeks at the moment so just sitting and patiently waiting...."
"We are due to fly to Crete August 8th. We wouldn't want to end up quarantined. Just hard to know what the right decision is.Edited: 9:34 am, July 07, 2020 "
"At this rate, I'm thinking that if the risk of being quarantined for 14 days is too big a risk to take - then holiday should be off. Not worth the hassle."
"Post 175 these rules don't seem consistent if you can elect not to quarantine with someone in your household testing positive but they might contact trace upto 30 people on a flight? Doesn't make sense as other household members would be way more likely to have it. Can anyone clarify please?Edited: 9:58 am, July 07, 2020 "
#183 - that's what the Greek Tourism Minister said in an interview last week - listen at 5:45 in the below linkhttps://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/soci…Whether it's because the risk is lower because you've had the test - whereas in the scenario of a stranger being positive near to you you're not tested immediately.
"I don't think it happens the way described in #175. If one member of a family tests positive others are also quarantined but for a shorter period of time (7days?) and then tested. The rationale behind that is that the authorities do not know if the infected person infected other members of his or her family. PCR tests up to 4 or 5 days after exposure come back negative as the virus needs time to replicate. One possible scenario that the infected member of a family got the virus more than 5 days before arrival in Greece (thus tested positive) but the rest got it later and on arrival in Greece still tested negative.My understanding is they can't be in the same room unless they choose so as if they were not infected on arrival in Greece, by staying in the same room with the infected member of their family, they all can get infected! In practice, it often happens that about 50% of people living in the same household do not get infected. They are in close contact, share the same spaces but nothing happens.I also wish the Greek authorities were clearer about various scenarios. Quarantine rules are different in different countries and people need to know what to expect in Greece to make an informed decision whether to travel or not.Edited: 10:23 am, July 07, 2020 "

"But what about the people who booked their holiday many months ago and stand to lose a lot of money if the tour operator doesn't cancel? Yes, you can say whats more important , money or health, but life isnt so simple for some who save all year for their annual holiday and to end up with nothing"
Interesting research here:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53320155
"The major issue in my view is not that there is a test and trace protocol with quarantine, it's the way the Greek government has implemented it.All flights require the use of masks - what's the point of travellers wearing masks if the government ignores that fact and insists on quarantine for everyone near/on the flight of the infected passenger? As I've said before, fully publishing the criteria for pre-testing and accepting those tests in lieu of an airport test would improve the situation for everyone. They would probably end up with more testing completed as I can imagine most passengers would want to remove the uncertainty, even at their own expense. No point doing those tests if there is a dependency on random stranger passing their own spot check.The website should be improved to clarify all scenarios. Details on testing of children, pre-testing, quarantine possibilities due to indirect passenger positive tests. None of this is clear. The frustration is we want to travel to Crete. The Crete tourism industry wants us there. With some common sense and pragmatism, a more efficient T&T protocol could be implemented that allows tourist to travel without risking an increase in infections."
"#193 I couldn’t agree more with you. I’m very happy to be tested as I will self isolate myself and family to protect ourselves as much as possible 2 weeks prior to our travel date.Also, if all travellers had to test prior to the flight no poor innocents would have their holiday ruined by having to self isolate due to being in close proximity even though they are wearing a mask.A sensible and pragmatic approach is needed indeed!"
I also would much prefer to bear the cost of a test if it gave me peace of mind of being able to enjoy my holiday if tested negative.
"The 2 rows story does not sound realistic, as Cretan newspapers are saying only 3 people are in quarantine hotels from flights. They never mentionned all the people in the rows (only the two positive and a friend of one of the two). There are only 3 or 4 quarantine hotels in Crete. If 30 new people of the 2 rows were in quarantine each time, the quarantine hotels will be soon overflown. To my mind it is not possible.Edited: 1:50 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"For me it's not about whether I ""like"" the rules or not, but that I want to understand what they are and what that means for my family. Rules is rules and whether I personally like them or not is immaterial. The potential for quarantine because someone on the flight tests positive is now emerging for me as the main reason not to travel - I thought I had that part clear in my head: we would protect ourselves as much as possible by isolating before we travelled, we were satisfied that the requirement to wear masks in the airport and in flight reduced the risk of infection in transit along with our own hygiene measures (hand washing, wiping down tray tables etc). Some people might not be happy with that risk, it's to a large extent a personal decision. But I hadn't considered fully the aspect I can't control: that someone else might test positive on the flight and land me and mine in a 2 week quarantine so I'm very grateful for this discussion for that. The issue over testing of children - having the information for that brings the decision fully into my control, which may be that we are prepared to accept that as a necessary step to our holiday, or we may not. It's about having as much info as possible to make decisions based on a fairly complex set of criteria, not a simple ""like it or lump it""."
This is so true eaglesrest! Not sure how people can make decisions without this information. We also need clarification for people with their own private holiday homes. If quarantining becomes necessary can this be done in your own private property or will you still need to go to the specified hotels. I’ve also read conflicting information on this today!
"So we flew today to Heraklion. It took about 20 minutes to go through passport control , they checked also the PLF forms and then we directed towards baggage claim. Near the baggage claim everybody from the flight stayed in line, on the left side, for testing. Only one person in a family was tested. My husband was the one who was tested. In my opinion they didn't use the QR codes to make a selection. Every passanger went to testing, and then they chose randomly one person from each family/group (travel companions written on the form) to do the test. My husband's PLF was on top and so his data was written on the test . We were not told to isolate for 24 hours, just ""thank you, have a nice stay"" .Tomorrow we will go ahead with what we have planned, and hopefully the only phone calls we'll receive will be from family and friends.Now this was for a plane that arrived from Romania, I don't know if they have the same method for other countries."
I wondered about that too. What is the capacity of these quarantine hotels on smaller islands like Kos for eg? And they are all at the Greek authorities' expense too which can't be good for them as they finally look like they are coming out of their crushing austerity measures. Can't see it myself...
"Thank you Ioana for sharing your experience. Enjoy your holiday!!Edited: 1:58 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"Thanks Ioana for reporting back, I hope you don't get the dreaded call tomorrow so you can enjoy your stay."
"It will be interesting to keep hearing about people's real ""on the ground"" experiences. Thank you Ioana."
193 and 197 totally agree with your comments. It is the lack of clarity. Info given on one official statement often seems to contradict that of another and then that of official spokesmen.More than happy to follow the instructions and protocols but just need to know what they are.Ioanna - thanks for the update and hope you have a great holiday!
"Alison, Em, Eaglesnest & anyone else asking for more detail about how people are being identified as 'close contacts' to people testing positive on arrival in Greece & thereby instructed to quarantine: In case this info can help you make your decisions.Close contact is defined as:--A person living in the same household as a COVID-19 case;--A person having had direct physical contact with a COVID-19 case (e.g. shaking hands);--A person having unprotected direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g. being coughed on, touching used paper tissues with a bare hand);--A person having had face-to-face contact with a COVID-19 case within 2 metres and > 15 minutes;--A person who was in a closed environment (e.g. classroom, meeting room, hospital waiting room, etc.) with a COVID-19 case for 15 minutes or more and at a distance of less than 2 metres;--A healthcare worker (HCW) or other person providing direct care for a COVID-19 case, or laboratory workers handling specimens from a COVID-19 case without recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) or with a possible breach of PPE;--A contact in an aircraft sitting within two seats (in any direction) of the COVID-19 case, travel companions or persons providing care, and crew members serving in the section of the aircraft where the index case was seated (if severity of symptoms or movement of the case indicate more extensive exposure, passengers seated in the entire section or all passengers on the aircraft may be considered close contacts)."
Thanks for the feedback to the forum Ioana great to hear from personal experience. I hope you have a great holiday.
Thank you all very much for your wishes!
Would be great if you could report back on how it goes!
"Please keep us updated with what happens on the ground, it's very helpful and will help others to make a decision. We are still undecided what to do. Wouldn't want to go all that way to quarantine, just want to go and have a nice holiday. we are due to go August 8th from Luton with easyJet."
Post 196 unless the press aren't reporting the close contact passengers being put in quarantine as it would be very bad publicity. Surely if someone on here lives in Crete it shouldnt be too difficult try and verify?
"Thanks Yiassas, that helps a lot. A x"
"Anyone got any stats? No of tests? No of positives? Number of people quarantined? There us no way we can make decisions without some numbers to estimate risk of quarantine.Edited: 4:39 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"Also wondering the same.The thought of being quarantined because someone on my flight tested positive, whilst understandable, might make me push my September trip out to next year."
Ooh and of course number if passengers.

Sorry if this has already been asked or mentioned previously but there are a lot of questions and answers to keep up with. Regarding the test at the airport does anyone know for definite if its nose and mouth swab or just mouth?
"I think my kids and I could handle just the mouth/throat swab, it's the nose swab that worries me as my son suffers from heavy nose bleeds and I'm worried it would set him off. Do you know this for definite?"

So are you saying other passengers unknown to a positive person but sitting nearby in the plane are not traced to put in quarantine as previously suggested 2 seats away? This would make a huge difference to people's decisions to travel. Thanks

"We have decided we are still going to continue with our trip. We have no problem with being tested, it's just the uncertainty if someone in close proximity is positive and we become close contacts and end up quarantined. If that's the case it will just have to be put down to bad experience. I think it could happen to us anywhere, we could end up having to quarantine at some point even in the UK for being in contact with someone. So it's just the risk we will take."
"Nicola and Dave, we have decided the same thing. The chances are there but they are slim. We are looking after ourselves here and avoiding the pubs and shops etc so I’m happy for us to be tested too.Let’s hope we all get there and manage to have a safe and enjoyable holiday."

"Nicola and Dave, Kranky80 - I’m sure others will take your balanced views of the risk although for some the possibility of being quarantined in a hotel room rather than their own home may be a step too far."
One thing that bothers me about the whole quarantine thing - Is the Greek government sure that tourists they are planning to imprison for two weeks (or longer) are in mental health good enough to survive it without any problems? The epidemic and the restrictions have already taken enormous toll on people's mental health. They go on holiday to relax and recover and where do they land? In a quarantine hotel unable to leave their rooms even for exercise. Can you image what that experience can do to someone who is already depressed?
Sorry one question.I don't find any resource on official Greek websites about the fact that you can go in quarantine also if you are not positive because you have travelled in the aircraft near a COVID-19 positive passenger.Is this an hypotesis ?Is this official from Greek Embassy?
"The info comes from UK government travel advice, Greek National Health Organisation (EODY) definition of 'close contact', WHO's advice what to do with 'close contacts', and comments from a person whose family was called by track&trace staff and removed from their booked house because someone on their flight tested positive.All links have been posted in this thread. Perhaps you should read it from the beginning?"
"I have read the thread but I'm asking if it's something of local and valid only for UK passengers or for all the passengers, I'm not from UK but from Italy .For this I'd like to know if the source is from Greece or UK."
There is no clarity from the Greek gov on this and on other issues. You have to decide what you believe yourself.
"Rob Fiorelli It's official & for all EU countries currently allowed to travel to Greece.After completion of your PLF form, 24 hours before travel, the algorithym will select people for testing. Once their tests are complete, if positive, track & trace will identify their close contacts."
"HI Steve, I exactly know the procedure that you have described and it's for all.I was only asking if it's official or not the quarantine in case of a ""Close Contact "" with a positive passenger in your same flight, also in case you are not COVID-19 positive.Edited: 5:14 am, July 08, 2020 "
"Regards possibility of quarantine it will again be very personal. I have a trip to Italy on my own in September and I am probably willing to take that risk for myself. But to end up in a small hotel room unable to leave for 14 days with 2 kids feels unfair on them, they have been cooped up enough this year... And some people will be in a position where they won't get paid for missing work for the extra time, which may be unaffordable, and some people in less secure employment might even lose their jobs. The risk profile will be so different for everyone, it doesn't feel like a matter of some people being sensible and balanced and some being a bit hysterical... I think we are going to wait till next year. Might take a driving holiday to France though maybe!"
"Hello, apologies if this has already been asked. We are travelling Gatwick to Santorini 25th July with easy jet. Can anyone confirm that if you provide a negative test taken within 48 hours of arrival you would not need to be tested. I understand this doesn’t negate the risk of other passengers yet would protect people as much as possible.Thanks"
"Fair enough, you must evaluate your own levels of risk tolerance. I imagine this would be a deal breaker for an awful lot of people, particularly those with younger children, despite the unlikelyhood of it happening.From Greece's point of view, it is all they can do to maintain the admirably low levels of infection, short of continuing a blanket travel ban. Imagine how Boris would have been lauded if we'd had something similar going on from March?Any travel is going to put you in 'harms way' , but if you can bolt for home should the worst happen, I see it will make the risk level more acceptable."
"I absolutely think Greece are doing the right thing, and my opinion of the UK govt handling of the whole thing is not high, but I think that's a separate discussion. I'm not annoyed about it or think they should change the rules, I think they are eminently sensible. Really any country should be implementing something similar to allow visitors, it just makes travel rather tricky but I don't think there is any way round it. Post 237, I think this issue got a mention earlier up and it's one of the things that's unclear. The ""rules"" say something like subject to verification, but it's not clear what that entails, what tests would be acceptable etc. And it also doesn't save you from quarantine if you get track and traced after someone near you on your flight has a positive test which is another risk you have to evaluate for yourself. I do think it's incredibly hard, and I wish everyone well with their decisions and their holidays if they decide to go."
Greece is doing very well. Other nations must do the same. No free entry without a minum check.
"My issue with travel to Greece is not about what the local government are doing - they are quite entitled to take whatever measures they deem to be appropriate.I am however taking issue with TUI. I had booked a trip with them back in January to Zante, 14 nights departing 30/8. Last week TUI cancelled the trip and offered me their usual refund voucher with associated incentives. I decided to look around for alternatives and was surprised to see the same holiday I had originally booked was available to book albeit at an additional £30 and 2 days earlier than the original.I had seen the TUI Promise regarding the impact of Covid and quarantining which says ""QUARANTINE-FREE HOLIDAYSWe promise we'll only take you on quarantine-free holidays. This means we won't travel to places that will ask you to self-isolate on arrival.""and I also knew that if the rebooked holiday was cancelled I was protected. I decided to accept the rebook.I was not aware of the Greek arrival protocols and I do feel TUI should have specifically highlighted this for anyone booking holidays to Greece.Knowing what I know now about the arrival protocol, I feel that the situation means there is a breach of the TUI promise. Whilst Greece are not testing and quarantining travellers en masse, it is surely the case that as I stand in the queue at Gatwick I can be pretty sure at least one of my fellow passengers will be tested once we arrive in Zante and it could be me - hence my view of the TUI promise.I have phoned TUI but the person I spoke to didn't seem to have any knowledge of the protocols - she thought there was just temperature checks at departure and arrival airports. She also said TUI were keeping things under review.I said I was considering cancelling but as I now have a new contract I will lose at least 50% of my holiday cost. So I am in a quandry - do I cancel and cut my losses or wait to see if the situation improves and the protocols are dropped or even see the holiday cancelled as infections increase in Greece? Really don't know. I would like TUI to offer me a voucher again so I can book something with it for 2021"
"Jimmy273: the PLF website states: ""Can a visitor provide the results of a molecular test (conducted up to 72 hours prior to arrival) to avoid being tested?Subject to evaluation, such tests can be accepted.""Make of that what you will. This is really key information but the information provided is vague and ambiguous. This is where the Greek government are really letting themselves down. They need to confirm if tests are 100% accepted. Which tests exactly they are - PCR, antibody or both? That tests are accepted for all incoming passengers regardless of departure country. With this information the passenger can start to mitigate risk of quarantine, not travel at all if infectious, and the key point for us - not require a test at the airport, which our daughter would not do.You still run the risk of quarantine due to other passenger infections, which again could be a couple of rows, or could be the whole plane in quarantine, depending on the infected passengers test results. Mitigating this is tricky other than picking seats with no-one near, front or back rows, etc."
"Hi, our flight is in 17 hours and we still have not received our QR codes.Dont you know ho to proceed ?Will they let us in with confirmation of PLF only ?"
"My airplane lands tomorrow (9th) and I haven't received the PLF QR code back? Is this normal? It seems the poster below is having the same issue.Edited: 8:11 am, July 08, 2020 "
It seems they're sending them close to on the day. Likely it's manually being processed so they're processing the ones for on the day first.As long as you've completed it. wouldn't worry about it. They'll either choose to test you or not when you land if you haven't got the QR code and have applied.

Thanks for the reply regarding the 72 pre travel test. I will keep an eye on this forum and await any confirmation. If this becomes well known you would hope majority of passengers on your flight would do the pre travel test to save any ‘surprises’ a day into your holiday
"Jimmy273:They were originally talking about making the pre-tests mandatory. If they had done that then this wouldn't have been an issue, but at £100 a pop its quite an expense on top of everything else. Plus there will have been a risk of fraud without some kind of reciprocal database checking. Get you healthy mate to do your home test kind of thing."
">>>>Can anyone confirm that if you provide a negative test taken within 48 hours of arrival you would not need to be tested.They say it's subject to evaluation but they don't say evaluation by who. The guy who scans your QR code and directs you to the appropriate queue? The people who do the tests? They are not even medics, just trained to to take swabsWhen countries like Austria or Czech Republic required negative tests before entering they issued detailed instructions including not only what types of tests are acceptable, but also provided templates for the labs to issue test results in German/Czech/etc so that was understood by border staff. And the results where digitally signed in compliance with the EU digital signature directive.There is nothing like that coming from Greece so expect that nobody at the airport will know what to do with your tests. You may do them for your own peace of mind, though."
"@robinG, after you’re settled in Greece, can you please send me a private message on your experience arriving in Greece was like and what you had to do? We are from Toronto, Canada are have a trip scheduled for September - arriving in Athens then catching a flight to Naxos. I’d greatly appreciate any insight you can provide to me on your experience travelling to Greece during Covid (were you tested at the airport, how long it took? What was it like, Etc) I’d be really grateful."
"There are a couple of small lifting of restrictions today:The use of protective masks by customers inside shopping malls will no longer be mandatory. However, staff will still be obliged to wear a mask.Previous rules allowing no more than six customers per table at bars and restaurants have also been withdrawn."
Still no QR code and my plane leaves Canada in 6 hours... Getting a little worried. I filled it out 7 days ago.

Thanks for the translation Jock. I admit I'm surprised they're easing restrictions but hopefully it all bodes well for the coming weeks.:-))
Yes but social distancing remains in place so all in all good news for people visiting as well as Cretans wanting to go out to socialise.

"Not sure what to make of this news ....https:/…https:/…""The lifting of the quarantine is accompanied by the decision that if a tourist is infected with coronavirus in one of the two countries, they will be able to return home for treatment, as long as the medical protocols set by the authorities are met.""Could this mean a relaxing of the 14 days enforced quarantine for positive tests, replaced by 'get out of here'?"
"Yes, that would be much better if infected persons could return home rather than be imprisoned in Greece for two weeks or longer. What Greece is going to 'discover' this year is that there a loads of asymptomatic cases that do not need any medical treatment. There really should be a protocol for the return of such persons to their countries."
I have just found out that our hotel won’t be opening this season. It’s hard to re-book because you just don’t know what is open and what isn’t.

"@ Nigel B reply #240There has been some discussion regarding the TUI promise in this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…I read the promise as TUI will not take you to a country that has blanket quarantine rules - which Greece doesn't have.If you test positive or have been seated close to a person who tests positive, you would not be ASKED to self isolate (the wording in TUI promise), you will have no choice."
#262 - hehe - I wonder how many positives you could fit in one loo? - 4 or 5 at least!

"I suppose that's where the "" as long as the medical protocols set by the authorities are met."" comes into play .....Impractical though, as you say ...... special corona riddled repatriation flights?"""
Kranky it would be worth staring a new topic for the area you are looking for and I am sure you will get suggestions for places that are open.
"Nothing on this article to say they traced the close contact passengers from the plane of the Greek doctor who flew in, only further down contacts within the group of 20 people who travelled together.https:/…"
"""Yes, that would be much better if infected persons could return home rather than be imprisoned in Greece for two weeks or longer. "" That may be, but how would the infected person(s) return home. Their normal airline wouldn't carry them. Will their insurance provide specialist medical transfer?"
"Not long ago airlines were flying no one, infected or not. With the epidemic likely to go for months if not years, the sooner they develop a protocol for flying covid the better for them and all of us."
"#260 Steve, Absolutely Brilliant Post, you just couldn't write it, they are Yet again, not Understanding their Visitors Fears/Worries."
"""Greek authorities say they are ready to re-impose public and travel restrictions next week, warning that safety guidance for the coronavirus is being frequently ignored. Stelios Petsas, the government spokesman, said authorities were ""determined to protect the majority from the frivolous few,"" adding that the government was likely to announce new restrictions if needed on Monday."" This could be referencing only the Balkan countries, but worth watching for those considering travelling next week.Source: https://www.ekathimerini.com/254537/article/…& I found this an interesting read, about a business tourism marketing survey:https://www.ekathimerini.com/254461/article/…A few of the notable findings:Only one in four appears willing to travel between July and September but even they are feeling discouraged by the unprecedented travel conditions.re Greek tourism: ""achieving 15 percent of last year’s tourism revenue will be a success""""key markets like the United States, Britain and Russia are basically out of the running and will be that way for some months to come""Two in three respondents, meanwhile, said that Greece has successfully managed the health crisisThe possibility of ending up in quarantine appears to be the key deterrent."
"Paula C #261I'm not sure I agree with your interpretation. This is what the Promise says (taken from the TUI general email sent 19/6)""QUARANTINE-FREE HOLIDAYSWe promise we'll only take you on quarantine-free holidays. This means we won't travel to places that will ask you to self-isolate on arrival""The text goes on to say""If we know a destination or hotel is asking people to self isolate when they arrive in the country, for any length of time, we simply won't go there""The latter part is written in terms clearly designed to assuage any customer concerns and intends them to be able to book without ANY fear of quarantine. Nowhere is there reference to automatic requirements to be quarantined.This is a consumer contract and as such will be heavily weighted in the customers direction. Also remember TUI's latest marketing is clearly designed to encourage travellers back with an assurance that they can now enjoy a worry free experience.I am hopeful that the Greek authorities will soften their approach as UK flights begin because I can't see any Brits wanting to visit Greece with the threat of quarantine hanging over them. I have a holiday booked with TUI to Zante on 30/8 but I will not travel if the current protocols remain and I shall expect TUI to honour both the letter and sentiment of their Promise and offer me a refund along the lines they have been up to now.Edited: 10:28 am, July 09, 2020 "

Hi NigelIt's OK to not agree. I don't mind if people disagree with me. You may have noticed that the 2nd reply on the thread I linked to had a similar opinion to me.I think it's just unfortunate that a 'promise' to customers seems to be interpreted differently by different people.Or is causing some degree of confusion.And it's a shame that TUI didn't answer Kelloulack's question (reply #6).
"Nigel B, The Greek test & quarantine protocols are in place until 31/8 at least, according to the Greek Gov't."
"Yes I saw that, but let's wait and see what happens post 15/7"
"Paula C - I spoke to a customer services person at TUI yesterday and as pleasant as she was, she had no idea about the Greek protocols. She said she thought there was just temperature testing at departing and arriving airports for trips to Greece.And on the issue of how the Promise is interpreted, it will be by the letter. I don't doubt TUI might have had a different intention but that's too bad on them I'm afraid. I have discussed this wording with my lawyer son and he is in little doubt that the Promise is broken if the Greek protocols remain in placeEdited: 11:32 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Paula #274. I've read the second reply to your linked thread. The Promise and its associated explanatory notes make NO mention of automatic isolation and this was part of my son's argument. The Promise talks about ""any person"" and hence lacks specific definition. It's poorly worded but if challenged will be construed against the drafter (TUI).You can probably tell I'm pretty ticked off with TUI but I'm hoping they are buying time until 15/7 in the hope Greece relaxes the protocolsEdited: 11:41 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Steve #275. Note also the Greeks seem to have just relaxed some of the rules in relation to Egypt which bizarrely has one of the worst infection rates.It's politicking just like BoJo and his ilk. As Lord Melchett said in ""Blackadder"" governments ""twist and turn like a twisty turny thing""!"
"Increased covid testing at the road borders with immediate effect, with approx 90% of the travellers arriving through Promachonas tested.There are now more imported cases of coronavirus cases in Greece on a daily basis. Health authorities are on “red alert” due to the imported cases that have been located on several islands in recent days.government spokesman Stelios Petsas said on Thursday that Greece may temporary halt entry to certain countries if necessary.At the same time, he stressed that “the biggest danger is not from abroad, but from inside Greece,” and spoke of “unacceptable phenomena of relaxation,” obviously referring to crowding at fiestas, bars and entertainment facilities."
Nigel. I'm inclined to agree. I've no doubt that when TUI made their promise they intended it to cover any mandatory 14 day quarantine but I think they may have shot themselves in the foot somewhat. They are promising me ' a holiday as relaxed fun and memorable as ever before'. And 'a brilliant holiday just like always'. A ridiculous promise to make with or without Covid19 but that's exactly what they've done.
"I’ve just received a “promo” email from Jet2 holidays promising the same “There’s no need to worry - we’ll only take you to destinations where you don’t have to quarantine, so you can really enjoy your time away” then further down the email you come to “Country entry requirements” with a link to the gov.uk foreign travel advice page which outlines the current quarantine requirements for Greece if you test positive on arrival! It’s all very misleading IMO."

"These companies going on about no need for quarantine must mean automatically quarantine.They cant say you wont end up in quarantine if you get Covid , Covid symptoms or been in close contact with someone with Covid.That should be standard for any country.You simply cannot have a risk free holiday from quarantine while this virus is about."
"#284 But the UK along with many other countries allows people in without mandatory testing, even on a randomised basis. Of course there is risk involved in all things we do in life, but we seek to minimise those risks. Like choosing a holiday from a company who ""Promises"" you a quarantine free holiday as opposed to a company that doesn't. It's called competitive edge and if TUI are hoist by their own petard then so be it. They are a big firm with access to high quality legal advice. I will have no sympathy if TUI lose out because of this ""Promise""."
#284 - That’s why phrases like “there’s no need to worry” and “so you can really enjoy your time away” are misleading when used in the same sentence as “you don’t have to quarantine” but no doubt a tag line of “we’ll only take you to destinations where you don’t have to automatically quarantine but if you are travelling to Greece and are selected for testing on arrival and the result is positive you will have to quarantine in a hotel room for 14 days” wouldn’t attract as many takers.
I haven't wanted to be 'taken' on holiday since becoming an adult. It only leads to disappointment.
"I agree.TUI shouldnt be advertising quarantine free holidays to anywhere. Thats not possible even with countries not doing random testing.Just seen the bars in Spain temperature checking customers. I really hope the next step for anyone who has a temperature is a trip to the nearest testing centre.This virus has to be controlled. The chances of quarantine are minimal.Greece seems far more in control than other holiday destinations.Edited: 3:22 am, July 10, 2020 "
All very misleading perhaps.It seems to be a bit of a surprise to lots of people that to travel to Greece that a PLF and QR code is needed. It also doesn't seem to be overly common knowledge that you may get tested on entry to Greece. Perhaps this is mainly the responsibility of individuals but also travel companies should be aware of this and pass the info into their customers.No where/no-one can promise that you won't get quarantined during this pandemic.
"Tightening of controls at the border with Bulgaria, to try to reduce the number of positive tests entering Greece. Those entering from Bulgaria by road are required to show a negative test carried out up to 72 hours in advance."
"What about the new rules ?Is the 72 hours in adavance only for Promachonas or for every one ? https:/…Edit :I'm relieved : here they say it is only for Promachonas : https:/…I hope the first page wrote too fast and the second is the right one !Edited: 8:28 am, July 10, 2020 "
"Yes it's Promachona only, as I have seen it reported today"
"Hi,I will be flying to Crete next sunday 19th of July for 5 days.I have not dared to book any hotel room or transport as Covid rules are changing frequently.Does anyone know if a 24h isolation period is mandatory if the passengers are tested upon arrival to a greek airport, please?Seems that the official website has been updated and I understand that it is no longer necessary:The test results are expected to become available within 24 hours. During that time, passengers who are tested are advised to practise social distancing according to local guidelines and self monitoring for symptoms that could indicate COVID-19. In case of such symptoms, medical advice and/or contact with the National Public Health Organization (EODY) Operations Centre should be immediately sought. Only in case they test positive, the authorities will contact them and proceed with the health protocol in place. Otherwise, they may continue with their holidays, adhering to the general public health safety guidelines.If travelers plan to have multiple stop-overs in Greece, they must declare this and report their initial destination and their travel itinerary for the next 7 dayshttps://travel.gov.gr/#/"
"That's correct Nuria. Complete a PLF form 24 hours before you travel, & you should receive a QR code. If you are selected to be tested, while you wait for the test results you are expected to be careful & not travel too much, don't go to lots of bars, clubs etc, but it's OK to go out to get some food etc. You don't have to completely isolate.Tests should usually take 24 hours, but sometimes it has been 2 days.IIf you test positive you will need to go into quarantine for 14 days. It is very quiet in Crete, so you will find a hotel to stay at easily, a lot but although not all are open."
"The new cases went up again today, up to 60, with 40 from travellers, increasing each day. Let's hope the new regime for the Balkans land border, requiring a negative test done before arrival restricts this from the 14th when that starts.Edited: 1:09 pm, July 10, 2020 "
Thanks so much :)
"SteveSitia, thank you for your updates. I’m always looking to see what you have to say, it’s very helpful. You mention that Crete is very quiet, do you know what Rhodes is like?"
"Thank you Kranky that's kind of you.I don't know Rhodes well at all, haven't been there for a long time, sorry. But I hope you have a good holiday if you get there."
Post 28 on this thread says so much and is well worth posting the link on this thread https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
"More news from Greece, https:/…"
" What have you heard about a new lockdown being announced next Monday, someone on the Rhodes forum mentioned it? Thanks"
"Hello,I'm sorry, but I didn't have the time to read all that has been written , so I don't know if I might repeat things.At the airport in Heraklion there is no air conditioning, but we arrived in the middle of the day and it was all right, not uncomfortable. The testing is inside, not outside.The waiting was not long , when they test only one person in a family. I don't know if they changed this selection method in the meantime. For example they announced in the news that all romanians and bulgarians need to do the test on their expense, before traveling. My husband was tested and so far nobody called us, which means the test was negative. I don't know if all the persons tested from our plane were negative so I don't know what to make of that post from last week of David, that said he and his family were quarantined because someone in the plane tested positive. I know from my personal news delivering person (my mother:)) ), that indeed romanians have tested positive upon arrival (thus the change in the testing requirements that I wrote above) but I don't know if any were from our plane. Day by day I see more tourists, but it might have to do with the place we visited. Yesterday at Falasarna there were quite a few , but i can't compare with other years because it was our first time on this beach. Everything is open and running wherever we went.  I don't know if this applies to all hotels, but at ours is like this: - they do the check in without your presence needed, they only ask to send them pictures of your passports on whatsapp - they minimize all contact and all comunication is done through whatsapp  - they bring to your cottage (we are staying at Stone Village) breakfast and dinner. They send the menu on the phone and you choose from there whatever you want. The food is brought in plastic one use casseroles. There is good and there is bad in this method. The good is that I can ask for breakfast to be brought the evening prior when we leave earlier than 8 (we choose things that we can pack and take with us) and we can ask for dinner to be brought and left on the table in our room if we get back later than 21:00. The bad is all that wasted plastic and also the fact that it takes us longer to have breakfast and be on our way (when we eat there in the morning) , because we also need to clean up after ourselves and wash the dishes (which I don't mind, but it eats up time)  - they don't clean the cottages , which is fine for me, I don't need another person to make the beds and arrange our night clothes, but the floors however, I don't know what to do about them. They get dirty even if we brought inside slippers.  Breakfast is here, need to go. Have a good day all!"
"Thank you so much for the updates Ioana.I am so pleased that now you can relax & enjoy the rest of your stay.It's so sad about the plastic; last year Greece was just starting to understand the need to reduce plastic waste, people were trying to use less, some places offering different straws etc, now this has totally stopped, everything is packaged in lots of plastic, disposable cups with plastic lids, plastic straws in plastic wrapping [sigh]. Hopefully next year we can re-start that environmental journey. You are lucky to be seeing beautiful places like Falasarna without too many people!"
Great update Ioana!
"Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences Ioana, have a great holiday."
Fantastic Ioana and thank you for taking the time to share your experience to the forum. Thanks for mentioning that everything is open and running wherever you went (as someone has posted on the forum a few times that apart for the large towns only half of places are open). The UK is also opening up in terms of hospitality and almost everywhere is having to use disposables for food and whilst compostable options are available in these financial tough times when businesses are struggling to survive the can also be cost prohibitive. We love Falassarna as well and wishing all the best for what I am sure will be an amazing family holiday :-)
Thanks Ioana for taking the time to post your experience ...especially at the airport.......Good to hear that places are open :-) have you been eating out ? as you only mention eating in the hotel? Again I would be interested to hear about the tavernas and whether they are all open yet ? Enjoy your time in Crete
That’s interesting - only yesterday evening we were informed via someone who lives in Chania Town that more tavernas in the villages would be opening on 15th July so it would seem that not everywhere is yet open.
The above post is referring to information about Almyrida and the surrounding villages. In Plakias the majority of places are open and Ioana is also reporting that many places are open where they have been visiting.
Thanks for the post Ioana.Hopefully over the final months of this limited tourism season and into 2021 we get more of theses updates from travellers.Have a great holiday.
"Maybe some clues on the pre-travel tests that are accepted in lieu of an airport test:https://travel.gov.gr/#/Not specific to air travel but some highlights:- nasal or throat swab tests accepted- certificates need name and passport/id on them. This would rule out the NHS testing options in the UK?- Public reference and health labs- Private health labs that are accredited. Not sure what accreditation this refers to?Even with the above, still subject to random testing."
"Just spoke to Greek Embassy and they told me if my elderly parents can’t produce the QR code from the PLF they will be fined 500 Euros each. I explained they didn’t have smartphones nor can we print it off anywhere on day of travel and how absurd it is they are only emailing it then, but the answer was tough! Not very logical from the country that gave us logic apparently!"
"Did you fill out one form per adult or one per family? I am still wondering if family members are only kids or adults as well.Edited: 12:15 pm, July 13, 2020 "
One per adult as only Under 18s within family
"We are travelling this week, 2 adults and 1 child. I filled out one form only as it asked for the details of other people travelling in your party. I hope I did the right thing!!"
I may have read that wrong so I’ve now filled in a form for the other two as well!!
"Help !I fill the form to go on Greece. I'm sur to have written teh right age but in the summary at the end, may age was not the same. Are they putting the age rank instead the right age ? Who can confirm ? I'm sure having written 41 and there is 40 in the summary."
"I just read they are considering making them compulsory in all public places, far too hot for that! Do you think this is likely? Thanks"

"An update from Greece:Infectious disease expert Charalambos Gogos told Greek TV on Tuesday that the country was experiencing a spike that could require new restrictions. Among the measures being considered are the reimposition of a limit of six people at cafe and restaurant tables, and making the wearing of a mask obligatory in all public places.“Masks can be an important weapon against the epidemic at this phase,” Gogos said, expressing particular concern about overcrowding at beach bars, nightclubs and village festivals, the so-called “panigyria.” The latter have been banned until the end of the month, prompting dismay in some local communities.While opening up to flights to the UK on Wednesday and to Sweden next Wednesday, authorities are boosting inspections at Greece’s land border, demanding negative Covid tests from visitors following a spike in positive cases from Balkan countries last week. And if necessary, new restrictions will be introduced, officials say."
New info for Crete shows the total cases is up to 30 on the island.11 since the direct flights started. https://www.apokoronaslife.gr/?p=75071
Hello!I’m supposed to be flying in this weekend with family. I was just wondering whether anyone had any clarification on whether the PLF needs to be done individually (I.e for each adult) or whether it can be done as a group? The form gives options to add family/non family members in the travel party but it’s unclear if we need individual ones...
"Uk visitors checked. Wed 7/15/2020 6:01 AMKoronovirus: Scanning checks on English tourists - It will be judged whether the borders will remain openAlmost all of the approximately 6,000 Britons arriving in Greece today will be tested for the coronavirusThe result of the sweeping checks that will be made on the approximately 6,000 British tourists who arrive in Greece today will determine whether or not the Greek borders for Britain will remain open.According to the plan, almost all the tourists who arrive in Greece will be checked and if the number (and the percentage) of those who will be found positive is low and will be limited to less than 30-40 cases, then with careful and continuous epidemiological surveillance checks the Britain's tourism market will remain open. However, if things turn out differently and the cases that will be confirmed are much more, then the government is determined to close the border again, weighing that the costs of the risk of dispersion are far more important than the benefits for tourism, in a year that is considered largely lost.Meeting in Maximou - Experts suggest stricter measuresExperts are trying to put a brake on the possibility that the course of the coronavirus in our country becomes uncontrollable as the spread of cases such as e.g. in Paros and Lesvos. In this direction, they suggest the taking of even stricter measures that will concern the domestic population, at a time when from today the controls at the land border are intensified and the flights from Britain are opened."

"<< too much spin by people trying to spoil it for others.>> I don’t think anyone would want to spoil it for others John, we might have different views that’s all"
It says every person entering has to complete one so I’ve done one for each of us just to be sure.
"Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. yesterday said ""The increase in cases are due mainly to the arrival of tourists, but also to the relaxation of the implementation of protection measures. The message, in order to avoid the country going into a second wave, was clear: Retain the tight controls.He said Greece must focus on protecting the health of workers, especially in tourist areas, but also on avoiding parties and gatherings, especially in enclosed spaces, where signs of relaxation have been observed. the Prime Minister calls for greater participation by local municipalities to control the implementation of the measures. He asks everyone to wear their masks & to socially distance, to avoid crowds & parties.To protect the Greek people as well as other tourists."
"It's extremely sad that this is happening, but it was entirely predictable. We have to hope that everyone follows advice and that cases will be kept to a minimum."
"Heraklion Airport was a breeze, aircon working, very polite medical staff took a swab from about 15% of our flight, arrived in resort, have not seen anyplace closed up yet (except the fur shops) no masks being worn outside but social distancing seem evident, weather is fab, cicadas a little noisy though."

Thanks Lucy. Sadly I can’t speak Greek. Can you translate please
"# John, you can copy and paste the Greek text in Google translate. Good luck!"
"It isn't possible to translate such a long text via Google. I only got a translation of the first two paragraphs, which didn't say anything about what ""Plan B"" is. Plan B for what? Links to newspaper articles in Greek aren't helpful without at least a summary of the contents."
you can get the translation on a laptopBasically the scientists are worried with over 500 new cases this month and the doubling of hospital cases fear that they will have a second wave by the end of August. There is talk of using masks indoors and the closure of beach bars and gatherings to stem the number of cases.I could copy and paste but it has copyright
"If a person tests positive for covid-19 after being tested at the airport, are they forced to go into quarantine accommodation provided by the Greek authorities or will they stay at their original accommodation? Also, will the person be split up from their family?"
If you put the forum on tablet or laptop you can use camera on google translate to read the article. In addition to Dellboys post 355 the article states the R rate is currently 0.3. There will not be another lockdown as the economy could not take it but there may measures taken in local areas that have spikes. Also said it testing will be particularly strict with UK travellers with a review if covid numbers high and border may be closed again. Second wave expected end August/ beginning Sept. I am hoping to visit first week Oct but may not risk it if testing lottery continues or second wave happens in Crete or here in Ireland. There is still some hope!
"Sorry to point out the obvious here, but the whole thing makes absolutely no sense. The government will quarantine passengers on the aircraft who were sat in the vicinity of a person who tests positive, yet they would let the negative family members of a person who tests positive stay in the hotel in resort? That just makes no sense considering the family members will have been with the positive family member and live with them and will have journeyed to the airport with them and will have likely kissed them etc. Is it just me that thinks the whole system is nuts? I agree with the testing at the airport but to quarantine negative people is crazy. At least those who are quarantined because they were sitting near a positive person on the plane should receive a follow up test within 7 days and be released to go on with their holiday, that is, if they have booked two weeks."
"Thanks for tips on using a tablet or laptop, and for explaining the contents of the article. I do hope there won't be a second wave. That would be terrible for the Greeks who have sacrificed so much already. And people like me and you Shuvly, who are wondering now whether to travel this autumn or not, will probably decide to wait until next year. Which would mean a loss of income for all of the people who work in the tourist industry."
It is indeed difficult to know what to do re booking flights etc. Ireland will be announcing our air bridges on Monday. At the moment flights are quite reasonable but I expect that might change from Monday. I will be so disappointed if I decide not to travel but it's a balancing act between the desire to travel and desire to be safe and keep others safe...
#360 Coupled with the fact that the authorities could quarantine a person who is negative because they sat next to a positive and poor Mr/Ms Negative is despatched to a hotel for 14 days which is stuffed full of positives!
"#360,Totally agree with your thought process .My partner is a chemotherapy/cancer nurse with NHS Tayside. Because she treats very vulnerable people who have a very low immune system she and her colleagues now get a weekly covid swap test. She has had negative tests up to now and by the time we go to Corfu in the middle of September she will have had 12 weekly tests. Hopefully they will all be negative. I think she would be a bit p*ssed off if she had to go into isolation because someone sitting close to us gave a positive result considering she has had all these tests and has worked all the way through lockdown etc."
"Mussye, Yes, people who are quarantined because they are 'close contacts' with someone who tested positive would be in the quarantine hotel for 7 days, then tested. If negative they may continue their holiday. Another quarantine hotel in Crete was announced yesterday, that's 6 now.The Hoteliers federation is calling for mandatory testing now that British are allowed to fly & with Sweden in a few days & talks of opening to the US very soon. & a Greek newspaper reported this morning that airlines would, from today, be instructed to check whether passengers have completed the PLF form, apparently in reaction to complaints at Heraklio of German passengers being fined when they did not know about it."
Airlines being required to check the PLF of all passengers has been confirmed as announced by the Aviation Authority. (Thanks to Nicksy & Twinkletoes) https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…

"Post 373 implies that the people who report on the seriousness of the pandemic, and the worsening of the situation in Greece, for the benefit of people who are trying to decide whether or not to travel, are thinking ""negatively"" and are therefore ""abnormal"".When ""positive thinking"" is based on denial of reality - in this case the rising rate of positive cases in Greece - it ceases to be valid. In fact, it is hiding one's head in the sand."
The feedback I am getting from people who have traveled this month (including yesterday) is still very positive.
unlike you Dimtris telling everyone its only a flu virus and will be over by Spring
HiAlabastron i totally echo your sentiments.On another note i am absolutely sick of a couple of posters on this forum thinking that they can insult anybody who has a difference of opinion to them. Such a shame as it used to be such a friendly forum.
<.< Such a shame as it used to be such a friendly forum.>> Yes totally agree smilee......Dimitris your comment in #376 really was totally inappropriate...let’s be kind !

"Thanks SteveSitia for starting this thread. I am sure many people were finding this info very useful.However, the arguments that are played out through this thread are unbelievable and totally unhelpful for the forum users in general.Such aggression and passive bullying is what has made other Crete DEs leave the forum in the past - a great loss to the Crete forum. Please be nice or take your arguments elsewhere!"
"Dimitri, I didn't attack you. It was you who attacked others, by implying that people who don't ""think positively"" are abnormal.Nor did I ""analyse"" you. I made a statement: that so-called ""positive thinking"", when it is a denial of the reality on the ground, ceases to be relevant or helpful.I could write a book about the fallacy of positive thinking (and in fact have). I believe that it's best to see things as they are, reality as it is. The reality now is that there is a global pandemic of a virus whose rapid, deadly spread has been caused very largely by air travel and tourism, that the revival of air travel and tourism is likely to lead to more cases, more deaths, more devastated lives; and as we see, is already doing so. It's lovely that people are able to have nice holidays, but I feel desperately sorry for Greece and Crete."
"The €500 fine is big but necessary, https:/…"
.So this is the 3rd thread that is about to get shut down due to arguments. Even though most people have stuck to giving the facts. It does make me ponder whether that is the agenda of a couple of people. It's as if they believe people shouldn't have the facts at their disposal.
"I have been followings this crete forum for a while and am sick of seeing these little arguments between people. I continue to read, as in between these disagreements there continues to be valuable information which is what the majority of us are wishing for. So can you please keep your little arguments to private messages and leave the forum open for those of us who wish to read the information and not the fights. Happy Friday. Namaste."
"Agree Shuvly. I am flying to Crete tomorrow and I have to admit that this forum and chat has done nothing but add stress to mine and likely other folks days before travelling. I am not going to look at it any more. What bewilders me is why there are so many folk on here making negative comments and breaking their backs to post information from websites and news articles to frankly freak people out. These same folk have also made it quite clear that they have no intention of travelling to Crete or Greece so what value are they actually adding or what benefit are they getting from adding stress to others? Are they now regretting cancelling their plans? It’s almost like they are getting enjoyment out of any negative news. As Dimitri said in an earlier post, it’s now like a ‘not to travel forum.’ Just let folk get on with their plans. What will be will be. We have heard positive stories so far from the Brits who have landed in Greece. That’s all we need. Let’s stop the sniping and debating over what could happen. If you have no intention to fly don’t make the start of holidays for others more stressful that it already is in these unprecedented times. Folk deserve a change of scene after the last 4 or 5 months and don’t need to be flying off a bag of nerves after reading the negative comments on here. Also, why post details from the FCO website or the Greek website on Covid? Aren’t folk intelligent enough to have done their own research. Sniping and trying to justify the negativity. If you aren’t going away then let folk enjoy their holiday preparations and journeys without fear, post positive and helpful comments with manners OR get out out the house and make the most of the nice weather. Keyboard warriors. It just puts people off even using these forums. It doesn’t matter how many years you have been using the forums or how many times you have been to Crete or Greece, a forum is a place for everyone to have their say without fear of being attacked by the know it alls. It’s like a classroom."
"Thanks Mussye, a great post and have a wonderful stay! Enjoy Crete!Edited: 6:51 am, July 17, 2020 "
I agree Mussye. Well said :-)
Well said mussye yeah some people can’t wait to knock people down if they have anything positive to say
"Hoteliers want every visitor tested, https:/…"
“A forum is a place for everyone to have their say”Yet you say you don’t want certain views a d information aired on this forum?
#393 I give up.
"#394. Yes of course I do, however the views being posted are largely through speculation and rumour or from untrustworthy newspapers / websites. The proof so far, from the people who have been through it is largely positive. What will be will be. I’m not going to engage in an argument. I put my views across. Your post unfortunately hints that you are. Have a good summer whatever you decide to do."
I’m not sure how querying an apparent contradiction is asking for an argument but FWIW I think your comments do Steve a disservice who lives in Crete and has given balanced updates rather than simply applauding the growing number of flight arrivals each day. Thanks for your good wishes.

Great post Mussye and have a fantastic holiday. If you have any questions at all the ask away on the forum (worth starting a new thread) and I am sure the friendly forum regulars will be happy to help out.
"I read all the links posted on this thread (and most of them posted on other Greece boards on TA) - even the Daily Fail ones.I've learned a lot.I decide whether to believe what I've read or not.I think the link from Lucy Lane (reply #393) about hoteliers wanting covid checks before travel is interesting and valid, even if some posters may deem it negative.I think that people should have as much information as possible before booking or before travel to allow them to make the decision that is right for them."
"Thanks Paula C. It wouldn’t be a big deal if people were to have to test prior to departure. I received my covid results this morning, having tested yesterday, just to put my mind at ease before flying tomorrow and of course to ensure that I won’t unknowingly be spreading Covid to others on the aircraft. I guess the article about hoteliers demands was interesting. The issue is, as is usually the case here in the uk, what the people want or demand is not always granted by the government. It would certainly make everyone feel safer if everyone took a test prior to flying. I know it’s not a requirement but could be an option. That way, people on the aircraft would feel safer and there would be less cases imported into countries abroad.Edited: 7:47 am, July 17, 2020 "
"Negative or positive..... all posts are welcome ....And I have found many of these links helpful, and thank you to SteveSitia in particular for your balanced and informative posts, it’s good to have someone posting who lives in Crete, but who isn’t connected to the tourist industry.But whatever your point of view there is no need to be rude and insulting just because others don’t agree with your views.Please be kind !"
"I agree with you again Paula, we need this information to make our own balanced decisions, I also believe everyone should treat each other with respect and that we all have the right to an opinion.Edited: 8:11 am, July 17, 2020 "
"Great post Mussye #389. Would appreciate an update on your return as we are are due to fly to Crete from Edinburgh On 15/9. I’m looking at the positives of flying from one very low Covid area to another, as having worked as an NHS nurse through this crisis I really need to look forward to Crete."
Mussye - Can I ask how you went about testing yourself and how much it cost? I'm considering doing the same thing.I also think having a test 72 hours before you leave is a far more pro-active way of dealing with travellers.
"In Scotland you can only book your test via nhs on the day of the test. I did it through the covid 19 page on the uk .gov website which has a link to nhs inform for Scotland. I booked it at 1pm yesterday and had the test at 6pm at Edinburgh airport. The results were in by 8am this morning.Edited: 8:24 am, July 17, 2020 "
">Where do I actually write "" are abnormal"" ???????? at the follwing text ""For someone who thinks positively as most of normal people do,<You didn't use the word abnormal. But when you say that most normal people think positively, you imply that those who think differently from you are both negative and abnormal (there may be a language issue here). But the forum members I believe you have in mind as being negative are actually those who think it important that people be of the facts and the seriousness of the pandemic, and of the possible effects of the revival of air travel and tourism, on the people of Crete.>Maybe you come many many years in Crete<How I would love that. But it is unlikely, as my age and health issues have put me squarely in the clinically extremely vulnerable group; and I don't intend to travel anywhere on a plane until it is completely safe for me to do so: right now, it's a risk too far. And given my age, ""many many years"" aren't available to me - though if they were, I'd want to spend as much time as possible in Crete. (Please don't anyone accuse me of sour grapes. I can't go to Crete myself, but I hope everyone who does tests negative if tested, avoids quarantine, and has as great a holiday as possible.)>and one might expect that you know more about our culture!<That is a fair comment. I would like very much to, and I hope to. I know a little, and you apparently think I should know more by now, but I don't know as much as I perhaps should. I'll say, though, that the Cretans I've got to know best have all been pretty realistic men and women, who try to see both the positive and negative side of things."
Safe travels partygirl when you travel and thank you for being on the front line. Any questions at all about Crete just ask away on the forum (worth starting a new thread rather than on this one) and I am sure the friendly forum regulars and not so regulars will be happy to help out.
"407 and MussyeThese pre-tests are also supposedly accepted in lieu of an airport test if in the right format. It's unclear from the PLF site what tests are accepted and how they should be presented ""Can a visitor provide the results of a molecular test (conducted up to 72 hours prior to arrival) to avoid being tested?A: Subject to evaluation, such tests can be accepted.""However, there is some detail on the requirements for pre-testing for those crossing the border via Promachonas. I'm thinking if we get a test, best get one as per those requirements rather than the standard NHS, so that we potentially do not need an airport test.Has anyone found any further info on what constitutes an acceptable molecular test? There are some private companies that may be able to provide them but I'm not wasting £400-£500 if they ignore them.We'd have to lie to get an NHS test and even then I dont think the results would be accepted by the Greek authorities as they will not be in a certificate format with passport number."
Why would you have to lie to get an nhs test? The form asks if you have symptoms. I said no. I didn’t lie. Anyone can get a test at the moment.
"Also the point of my test was not so it could be accepted by the Greek authorities, it was so I know if I get a test in Greece tomorrow evening I have nothing to worry about."
"Mussye. I cant speak for Scotland but we are told we can only get a test if we have symptoms. Although i realise your test was for your peace of mind.MaggieEdited: 8:52 am, July 17, 2020 "
It’s the same form as in England as the form you fill in is through the gov.uk website. The question about where you live comes at the very end after you have said no symptoms.
Thanks Mussye. I'll look into that!. :-)

Not read a single report from anyone confined to a 'quarantine hotel' as of yet - which is a great thing and let's hope it stays that way .

">>>>Not read a single report from anyone confined to a 'quarantine hotel' as of yet - which is a great thing and let's hope it stays that wayThat's because until recently those in quarantine were not from English speaking countries and Tripadvisor forums are not really popular in other countries.

I can't believe that TA is allowing this thread to continue with all the nastiness and back biting on here.Thanks Steve again for starting it with the thought that it would help people.Non of the later threads have anything to do with PLF.
You are very welcome Mussye and I look forward to hearing all about your trip if you get the time to post :-)
"><< You are an old member and you can't hide behind excuses like I am old or sick etc.>><Dimitri, I didn't see this post before it was removed, but I assume it referred to what I said in my post 409 about my age and the health conditions which make it risky for me to travel abroad. If so, it was an unspeakable thing to say, a real affront, and I am not surprised it has been removed. That is what I would call call a truly negative post, and I always regret the removal of such posts, because they make nonsense of the discussion, but also because they show the poster in a not so flattering light, and that can be useful.And now your post 429, which I did see and was equally shocked by, has also now been removed. That is, the one in which you said that I had been the only member of the ""clique"" you had respected, the clique you referred to in your extraordinary, uncontrolled post to Deb R. Dimitri, there js only one clique here on this forum, and I think you know, as well as I do, who belongs to it."

"I filled in the PLF 2 weeks before flying and again 2 days before (just to make sure!). I put my kids on mine and did not do separate forms for them. I got 2 QR codes at midnight and 00:03 on day of travel. Both were the same code anyway.We flew from Birmingham UK to Heraklion this morning. Flight was half full. Everyone (apart from the row alongside me who wore them as eye masks, under their chin, and not at all!) wore their masks throughout.On landing, they glanced at QR code and sent pretty much everyone into the queue to be tested (after passport control and before baggage collection).They took details from QR code, wrote it onto a sticker for a sample vial which you then gave to someone who took a very quick and painless throat swab. No nasal swab. They did not swab my kids (10 and 12). Took about 45 mins from leaving plane to getting on coach.Note that Jet2 did tell a Greek national (who had booked flights night before) that he could not fly without a QR code as airlines are now responsible for ensuring everyone has one and it is checked at boarding gate.They did not issue any guidance other than continue to social distance, no rule about 24hr isolation was communicated. 24hr wait for test results so fingers crossed for that.Masks on transfer coach. And that's it. No masks in hotel needed (different hotels, different rules) or in shops or bars.Hope that helps alleviate some fears as I was very worried before travelling.Edited: 3:27 pm, July 17, 2020 "

"Mussye, I never said anything about why you got your test. I was asking for information about how we might get a test that will kill two birds with one stone - peace of mind, safety, and addresses an issue with my special needs daughter who would really struggle with a test in an airport. This is supposed to be a thread for information. Everyone is so damn prickly. You'd think we've all been living in lockdown or something ;)You are wrong on the NHS test requirements. The only people who should get tests are those with symptoms, live in Leicester or about to go into hospital. Nothing to do with getting tested on the NHS to travel on holiday, hence my comment about lying. Not judging just stating fact. It's stated here: https:/…We all know why the NHS tests are provided, and at this time they are not for travel purposes, though with all the testing requirements and risks associated with it, maybe they should be some formal system in-place."
"eaglerest, Mussye was talking about how to get a test in Scotland and not England."
"Goanjock:The link to the NHS site states for England, Scotland, Wales and NI"
"All I want to know is if anyone has managed to get a test that would be accepted in lieu of a Greece airport test. Even if the NHS tests were formally allowed without any criteria, the current format probably wouldn't work for Greece, although that requirement is ambiguous.I've tried emailing the Visit Greece site, contacted the tour operator, like getting blood out of a stone."
eaglesrest2 I really don't know about England Wales or NI but I do know that I/we could get a test in Scotland if we wanted to.
"goanjock: How, on the NHS?I've just followed the form through for Scotland and it states:""Who can have itYou can get a test kit for yourself and up to 3 other people you live with who have coronavirus symptoms.In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a child can have a test whatever their age. In Scotland, children have to be aged 5 or over.""Can you point me to anywhere official that says you can get a free test without symptoms, as if it applies for Scotland it should also apply for the England?Edited: 4:56 pm, July 17, 2020 "
I am really sorry but out of Scotland I really don't know (with devolution it varies throughout the UK).
https://www.nhs.uk/ask-for-a-coronavirus-testWhen filling in the form it asks if you have symptoms. I replied no. Still allowed me to book a test.
"Musseye/goanjock:Thanks both. Guess they don't really care as long as they keep the test numbers up.What format did the results come in? Text/email, letter? Did it have your name, address, DOB and an NHS stamp etc?"
"Eaglerest2, I certainly wasn’t being prickly. I realise the tests are not for travel purposes. However, I felt I was being responsible taking a test prior to flying. If the form let’s you book a test you can book a test, I have tested twice since the tests have become available. It might be because of my job. The form does ask about your job. Each time I have stated no symtoms and it has allowed me to proceed with the booking. I sent a link in my previous post. Let me know how you get on. No questions are asked at the test centres. If you have an appointment you are tested."
The test results come in a text and email with the NHS logo and your date of birth. I am keeping the booking confirmation too in case it becomes useful.
"MussyeThanks again. We’re going to get tested one or another. Like you say peace of mind. It’s a bonus if the Greek authorities will accept it too as it avoids our nightmare airport scenario.They really should be as clear on the airport test rules, as they are on the land border, then travellers could take steps to reduce the risk."
