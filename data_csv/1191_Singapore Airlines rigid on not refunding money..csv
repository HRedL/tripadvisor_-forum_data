We spent thousands of hard earned money for tickets to Singapore. The airline flat out refuses to refund money due to the coronavirus. Shame on them! We’ll never fly on Singapore Airlines again!
"you might want to search google for what else you can do to try to get a refund if you have been refused once.I recall one person who didnt give up, escalated and got it. Check threads.Updated Travel Waiver Policyhttps:/…Good luck"
We’ve called numerous times with the same response.Thank you
So sorry Anne.
As you have not given all the info it is hard to comment. Were they non refundable tickets ? when is the trip for ? Have you tried claiming from your travel insurance.I don't think you are the only one in this situation but as Travel to Singapore has not been banned then it's down to the discretion of the airline themselves sadly .
"Terms and conditions apply,You must have signed for your tickets accepting the T&Cs during the booking process. If, in the unlikely event, SIA have done something wrong, then you will have a legal case against them."
"If your own country has not put out a Travel Advisory saying US citizens must not/can’t travel to Singapore, and the flight has not been cancelled by the airline, and its a non-refundable ticket, and this is just your disinclination to travel because you have concerns or fears then most airlines wouldn’t give you a refund in those circumstances.Airlines seem to be refunding if they (the airline) have cancelled the flights. I read on the TripAdvisor Air Travel forum that Singapore Airlines has cancelled some specific flights and they put out a list of those. People who had booked those specific flights will get refunds or be shifted onto operating flights.People are still travelling to Singapore and enjoying their holidays. They of course are monitoring the situation. Singapore has not been shut down.Why do you want to cancel and get a refund? Is this concerns/fear of catching this virus or do you have a reason you could claim on your Travel Insurance Policy?"
This topic written by one of your fellow Americans might be useful to read as they continued with their trip:- https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29…
Hi I'm sorry you are having trouble getting a refund but it does depend on what ticket you bought in the first place. If you bought a non refundable ticket then they have a right not to refund the money. I'm in the same situation having bought non refundable tickets to Singapore next month. My companion does not want to go now with the corona virus but we have looked at other options rather than cancelling and losing our money.we have bought another ticket onwards from Changi and going to Kuala Lumpur instead! Changi is a major hub and I'm sure you will be able to find a connecting flight onwards..the other flight was a lot cheaper than cancelling our tickets and we are still having a holiday.. keep looking at your government website for updates. The foreign & commonwealth office(FCO) has not advised against travel to Singapore so we could not claim on our insurance as it was our decision not to visit.
"Hi Helen,Just to add. on current evidence the FCO, *IMO* is unlikely to declare against travel to Singapore for 2 reasons:1. Compared to the rest of the world, containment and quarantine in Singapore is actually about the best standard in the world.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coron…2. Increases in cases have actually declined since Feb 14 to date - see graph of daily confirmed cases here:https:/…7e30edc490a5441a874f9efe67bd8b89Under these circumstances, in my opinion, unless the situation changes dramatically in Singapore, and i doubt it will, FCO advice will *probably* remain the same.Edited: 7:09 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"Anne, there was a woman from Australia who posted on one of these other threads on the CV maybe a week or so ago who said she got a free cancellation on non refundable tickets. She said she contacted the airlines and it went to escalation, her flights were cancelled but she had yet to see the refund. She hasn't been back on the forums. Not sure if it was legitimate. I am trying to find the thread where she posted. Maybe her post has been removed as many seem to have been. If I find it i will PM her and ask for details."
"Indian government issued an advisory on 22 Feb to defer travel to Singapore. I have booked my flights thru travel agent, a non refundable one. Is any possibility they can refund the money."
Hi Satish I think you will have to contact your travel insurance. If the Indian government has issued an advisory against travel there then you would have a good claim for refund..
"Hi Bill I quite agree with you! I have been reading all the posts and accessed the information links that Minxbaby posted, except I keep losing her post. Singapore has a very high standard of cleanliness and health and if visitors keep good hand hygiene then traveling there should not be a problem unless they have underlying health problems. It's not the mild flu like symptoms that are causing the deaths but the antibiotic resistant pneumonia.Singapore is doing its best to protect its population and visitors. The FCO would have advised against travel there if there was any threat to visitors."
"Well its everyone's risk. So happen you book a ticket coming to spore and the Covid case scares you off, life here is as usually. Hotels are operating as usual, I happen to be staying in Orchard Hotel past few days due to my house renovation, breakfast time, I can see almost 60% to 70% full.....Take it easy, Spore govn operates differently from the rest , you see numbers a bit high past weeks (as of today its 89 case with 51 recovered and discharge), thats because local govn dont wait till you fall sick and you turn up in hospital and than they say you have been hit by the virus.Once you have a case they will work round the clock (like detectives) to trace all your previous contacts and at the same time immediately quarantine your family members and your colleagues. That way the containment will be more effective (but not guaranteed). Those confirmed cases for the past 1 week or so are not those walking on the streets but those already under surveillance or quarantine.If you are still very worried, than change your SIA ticket to another date (but likely you have to pay some fees...Look at South Korea, 2 weeks or 3 weeks ago the confirm cases is very low, now its scary. Confirmed cases as of today 883. Another country : Italy, use to be 1 or 2 cases , now it ballons to 152.So the only country in Asia that is zero will be indonesia..... can you trust their numbers...."
"Google winter flu death, scary numbers reported. And annually reoccurrence in USA."
"I was one of those who canceled my trip and received a full refund from Singapore Airlines. They actually already issued the credit. As others have noted, the key was to call the airline and just stay on the line until they agreed to give the money back. Email was not effective. Ironically, my son and I wound up catching some sort of respiratory illness here in the US, so it worked out that we canceled. I can only imagine the reaction we would have gotten hacking and wheezing our way all over Singapore."
"Jess, sorry for you and your son. Hope you have both recovered (are recovering) well. Well done on your refunds."
"We flying end of March to Singapore. I was worried for start but not anymore. Was thinking doing the same - flying to Kuala Lumpur or Langikawi from Signapore, but more i read about Singapore cleanliness - high measurments that they been taking againist coronavirus - you couldnt aks any thing better then that. Also received email fro Singapore airline about their disinfection policy - how they removing all the magazines from seat pockets, planes it self been disinfected , all the head rest single used ect ect. My partner still not excited as me :-) ahahah i even bought new bikini today lol literally cant wait :-)"
"Thank you Bill. We are recovering, but would have been ill for most of our trip had we gone.I continue to appreciate the great service we received from Singapore Air and the hotels we booked with. As a result of their help, we can afford to rebook for next year."
"We have a similar problem. We have booked 2 cruises leaving from Dubai in a couple of weeks but we are flying there via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Even though all is well at the moment, the cruise line could add Singapore to its banned list. Other countries we are planning to visit could also do this.We have been so worried that we have actually booked a second flight directly to Dubai as a back up as this is part of an extensive holiday, ending in Istanbul. We contacted Singapore Airlines to ask them would it be possible to not use the first 2 legs (Australia/Singapore/Dubai), and, with their permission, return on the last two sectors of the original ticket (Istanbul/Singapore/Australia). They will not allow us to do this. We would have to totally cancel, and rebook a very expensive one way ticket from Europe home.It would cost them nothing. We are not asking for any refund. They could resell our seats on the first legs.I fully understand that we booked under certain non refundable conditions, but feel some good will could be offered as this is not of our making. We would much rather fly via Singapore. We have hotels booked in both directions and at our age, do not enjoy 14 hour flights. We obviously cannot make any decision under these conditions till closer to our leaving date. It is all incredibly stressful.Has anyone had any success in negotiating with the airline in similar circumstances?"
"Hi Vikutska,I hope you will put your newly bought bikini to good use if you visit Singapore. Beautiful blue sky, even if it rain suddenly it will usually pass very quickly and sun returns. So I don't really check our weather here cause will not cause too much disruption. Many indoor area for you to hide too. Cheers!"
"Just to update on the ground situation here today. Went for a nice walk, followed by a cold beer and a great lunch...."
"@enjoying_retirement1, normally it is not allowed but when HK protests were worsening, someone posted in the HK forum that they decided to buy new tickets to fly earlier to Singapore and asked SQ to allow them to use the final leg of their original booking, so I guess it is up to your negotiation skills and the staff you speak to.https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…https:/…102769908"
"Thank you minxbaby for taking the time to reply. The more evidence we can gather, the better our chances at improving our bargaining skills.Our route has had more cancellations but not for our flights so far."
"Jess_S,What did you say to compel them to refund you? What words did you use?Hold times are lower now and I got thru to a seemingly more sophisticated agent. She is going to call me back after reviewing my file. But I'm not sure how to compel mercy or get a company to change its policies.For those thinking on going to KL, I thought Malaysia closed their borders to outsiders."
"Suffering the same fate.It is a hypocritical airline - they said they would offer ""free rebooking to all passengers"" when in fact they are not allowed to fly to most places due to wide-raging travel bans. Instead of refunding affected customers (which most other airlines do), they refuse to refund.What's worse - they increased the ticket price by 80% under ""rebooking"" section online - and then kindly offer you a ""free re-booking"".Any request for refund is rejected outright.Do not be misled by their advertisement."
"This is a black swan event and times are difficult for airlines. You can see from here SQ is not the only airline offering credits for cancelled flights. https:/…You have until 31 March next year to rebook so maybe wait and see when the pandemic abates. When flights resume to normal, fares should come down."
"It is understandable that SQ wants to conserve cash for their own survival, but charging customers more than double for the same flights on same dates on exactly the same fare class for their “free rebooking” is outright lying."

Yes I did just that. Rebooked existing booking (K) class - $650 vs making a new booking (K class) $370. On exactly the same date.
">> charging customers more than double for the same flights on same dates on exactly the same fare class<<Why would you rebook the same flight on the same date? Are you just using that to check if the airline is overpricing? Even within the same class, there are different price buckets; when the number of seats allocated for the cheapest bucket are sold, the fare moves to the next bucket. Tickets with less restrictive terms and conditions tend to be in higher price buckets. Fares are also determined by supply and demand and airlines use computerised systems running complex algorithms to set the appropriate price. You cannot expect the price to be the same as when you first made the booking even during more normal times."
"Yes I did just that. Rebooked existing booking (K) class - $650 vs making a new booking (K class) $370. On exactly the same date. Booking were made less than one minute apart, same/different devices, for several times. Same results."
"Then I suggest you contact the airline to get an explanation.Edited: 10:44 am, March 27, 2020 "
I did. And they said no refund. By the way Cathay Pacific put up a web link for refund for all bookings. Understandably if hundreds of customers ask for refund at the same time Singapore Airlines might not be able to cope. But this trick is a disgrace.
Did you ask them why there was a difference in fare?
"Thanks BILLUK32 I’ll try. I understand the challenges facing many of us are unprecedented and I am not against customers “lending” to airlines to help them through this extremely tough period (didn’t claim refund from Cathay Pacific on my another ticket). What I wanted to point out is it is not right for Singapore Airlines to take advantage of the kindness of customers.And after this episode I really have no confidence in them - maybe they’ll increase the fare 200% after flight operations resume, for us to have the privilege of paying extras (again) so as to use the “retained value” of our old ticket?"
There could be a system issue or some other more reasonable explanation. Please ask them to explain the reason for the price difference between rebooking and making a new booking if you haven’t done so.
"Received a call back from Singapore Airlines today - the woman at the customer service was indifferent, rude and incapable. She insisted that I pay S$300+ for rebooking to a fare class that will not incur additional change fee.And she confirmed the rebooking is NOT FREE - passengers will not be rufunded the fare difference (if your new fare is lower than what what you paid for); but will have to pay extras if the new fare is higher than the original ticket price.I also asked the Singapore Airlines customer service representative whether the offer of a ""free refund"" was hypocritical - she could not deny it.Rather disappointed as a loyal customer.Edited: 11:14 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"After reading the waiver policy, it appears that the rebooking fee is only waived for those with tickets issued before 15 March 2020 for travel up to 31 May 2020. Does your ticket fall outside that period?https:/…20Policy"
My ticket was issued in February for travel in March. It’s become quite clear that the rebooking isn’t free - they called back this afternoon to discuss - and again Singapore Airlines will charge $100+ for rebooking. Will try again to get a refund in voucher instead - hopefully it’ll close the case. Will update.
I find their retention of my money as unethical.I flew Sydney to Singapore on SIA and then onwards to Langkawi on Scoot in mid- March. Non-refundable tickets purchased in November.Whilst In Langkawi Malaysia went into lockdown.Scoot stopped flying to Singapore and cancelled my flight. SIA cancelled my flight to Sydney.Trapped on Langkawi my only out was an expensive one-way ticket home on Malaysia Airlines via KL.Now home I am told that I can retain the value of my ticket for when my plans firm up. When airlines cancel all services to your destination and offer you no assistance in getting home I find it shameful to not be offered a refund and only to be offered a credit for a return trip that I have already made with another airline.Non-refundable should apply when the passenger cancels their trip NOT when the airline cannot provide the service offered. That is theft.
"Anne SFirst of all they must refund the money for Covid-19 cancellation,if not then you ask them to get re-schedule for next year trip."
"DIPEN N - I think so too. But Singapore Airlines refused to refund. Yesterday I was quoted additional S$120 for rebooking on the same fare (ECONOMY LIGHT) - and the reason was: I had a K+N original booking, and the new itinerary I requested for is “N+K” combination.I think they are going to overcharge every unsuspecting customers with this kind of tricks. Still don’t know why I should bail out Singapore Airlines by allowing them not to refund and by being overcharged for helping them out."
Markymark69Sydney - you should call them and if it still doesn’t work - write a complaint to CASE SINGAPORE (consumer ombudsman) and Singapore Small Claim Tribunal ($10 admin fee). It’s ridiculous that they dumped you and not offered a refund. They are essentially stealing money from every customers affected.
update: singapore airlines call centre lady just called and said they have escalated the case and full refund was approved.

"Pompom, thanks. It’s mixed feeling on my end - on the one hand I understand it’s just like how banks operate-if everyone goes to the bank to withdraw money the bank will fold, but on the other hand Singapore Airlines is being too rigid - insisted on charging extras for rebooking, just because my original booking was N+K and the new one is K+N. It came as a surprise. Am nonetheless glad the case is closed."
"@Anne S,Did you get a refund ? It's a shame what the airlines are doing. They should ask their respective governments for support and not bother the individual traveller."
"You do realise that governmental support will ultimately be paid by the taxpayers? Considering the number of industries that need support during this time, how many can a government bail?"
So you think I should not claim a refund out of sympathy for the Singapore taxpayers ?
To William. Well done mate and congrats on your little victory !
"#50, my reply was in response to the suggestion in #48 that all airlines ask their governments for help to give refunds to all their affected customers. It is a worldwide situation with an untold number of jobs at stake.You should do whatever you feel is right for you. I read somewhere that under Australian Consumer Law, a voucher in lieu of a refund is acceptable.Edited: 2:36 am, April 05, 2020 "
"markymark69Sydney, I'm afraid that I don't have any sympathy for you. You have to take responsibility for your decision to travel at that time.On the 13th March, the Australian Government advised Australians against any non-essential travel overseas.On the 18th March, the Government issued a ""Do Not Travel"" order.You said that you traveled in mid-March, and even if it was in the days prior to the 13th, anyone could have seen that the writing was on the wall that travel plans could be disrupted.If your travel was for essential reasons, then I apologize, however if it was just for pleasure, then you must bear the consequences of your ill-advised decision."
"New updates to the policy. Singapore Airlines Offers Bonus Flight Credits and Processes Refunds: https:/…Edited: 8:51 am, April 09, 2020 "
"Singapore Airlines changed refund policy and now offers refunds - that should conclude this discussion. Understandably SQ, just like almost all other airlines, has been struggling with liquidity and hence trying to conserve cash. An unwise decision IMO is SQ still insists on matching old fare class with the new one, resulting in customers having to pay extra to rebook in many cases. Even though both bookings are on, e.g. Economy Lite. In these cases customers are left with no choice but asking for a refund - even if they'd like to rebook (and leave the money with SQ). But again this is an unprecedented situation facing us all. Will still travel with SQ in the future."
"Will SQ extend this new policy for the travel date up to 8/31/20? Our flights to Surabaya is not until August. Most likely I will reschedule for next July/August. I looked at Covid 19 Assistance Request Form, there is an option for"" I am ready to change/ re-book my flight"". I enter departure date, return date, number of passengers, class, destination. It is also said that SQ representative will contact you. Will they contact by phone/email? Does this mean if the new ticket cost is more, we will pay the difference?(The current booking change policy for my ticket is I have to pay $50 to change, and value of new tickets has to be equal or more)."
"Will SQ extend this new policy for the travel date up to 8/31/20? ==> No one here can tell U that - U need to refer to Singapore Airlines (SQ) Website for the details. So far SQ only published up to June 2020.Will they contact by phone/email?==> Via Ur original Email address when U did Ur initial booking (If U did not provide in Ur Covid 19 Assistance Request Form.)Does this mean if the new ticket cost is more, we will pay the difference? ==> Yes definitely.Edited: 1:53 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"I was due to fly tomorrow & they cancelled the flight. I called the agent up & SIA are giving me a full cash refund. I wasn’t expecting this at all and thought they would just ask me to re-book another time. Sorry this isn’t the same in your case, but it doesn’t seem to be the rule for everyone"
"My trip to Thailand in June, will highly likely be cancelled too. Best thing, the airline doesn’t even allow us to refund our flight as they feel that it is still early (I think they are hoping that things will get better by then, which I highly do not think so.)But anyway, I Google-d and chance upon this interesting website for Singaporean people to rant about all sort of things.. https://knn.ninja Even the name of the website is hilarious :D"

"Anne,I find this complaint absolutely amazing, in all my years of flying with S.A. I have never had a complaint of any sort or type or heard of one until now---but these are unusual times for us all at the moment and lets hope it is a moment in universal time for everyone. I have never been refused flight changes/2 cancellations/1 late arrival where they put me onto a following flight on one occasion had to return home at very short notice and upon contacting S.A. the quickly organised my travel out of a different country involving 4 flights and got me home in 20 hours--a record of customer service for which I shall always be grateful. But after reading your complaint I have to ask myself what are the full terms of your ticket, {did you read all the small print} and ask relevant questions at the time as to your coverage in all events. You are receiving lots of advice and not all of it good---mostly knee jerk reactive. If you are no longer in possession of the terms and conditions of you flight contact the agent who sold you the ticket[s] and read it carefully through every word of the small print as well--very important this as many things are hidden here and some parts need to be read twice or more to understand the legal phrases of entrapments as I prefer to call them. You need to move this complaint forward in a methodical and factual way and not on a public forum. Do it methodically and you will succeed. Move up the chain of S.A. step by step, it may seem daunting but you will achieve. Good Luck and believe you can do it"
SQ has cancelled many flights until end June and has grounded about 200 planes. That number of planes would translate to hundreds of flights with thousands of passengers. It would take time to process the refunds. Singapore is still in its “Circuit Breaker” period to break the chain of Covid19 infections. Many businesses not deemed essential are closed. Businesses deemed essential are functioning with about 20% of their total headcount.
