"Hello,We are young couple landing in Naples this August. We will have a full week to explore the province or even more of Campania Region. To do this, I'd love to get recommendations of where to stay, what to do in Naples province or somewhere not too far from the province (reachable by public transport). What are your best experiences from Naples?We are really interested to see as much as possible around, to do some sightseeing, but also to have some lazy days by the sea, or having delicious foods&drinks at some beautiful spots. We prefer coastal towns/cities/villages.Anything would be helpful! Thanks!"
We would suggest that you visit Caserta and the music school there. Naples with its size and various layers of cultural complexity can readily overwhelm you. There is enough there like archeological and art museums and many famous buildings including churches and cathedrals to occupy much of your time. It is not a small town in any way. Lazy days by the sea are not in abundance. Public transport will transport you to Caserta by train. Campania region is within reach also. Cilento National Park can be found in the southern part of the same region. Rail line south of Naples will stop at Agripoli near the coast to lead you by bus to the park that is more inland with the town of Giugano located at the bottom of a cliff inside the park to greet you. A full week can be easily consumed with only a full week in Campania. Amalfi coast does not not have a train line for transportation to many or most of the places that travelers want to see. Lazy days near the sea are available to be visited The Amalfi coastal landscape is beautiful to admire.Villages and small towns are within reach. You can travel by train to Salerno and then further south to Paestum to see the antiquities. North and south of Naples there is a train line that goes along the coast to the border with either Lazio or Basilicata or Calabria. Delicious food and drinks are available in many locations. Many beautiful spots are to be found in the area inland and near the sea coast. Our preference is to visit Caserta and Salerno and Paestum by train. Pompeii and Herculaneum are there also for this stretch of travel. For us Pompeii has limited value as we prefer to deal with contemporary Italy first. Coastal towns and villages canbefound on the Amalfi peninsula. Ravello has many panoramic vantage points to occupy your time. Two or three days visiting Naples can take valuable time from going to many other places that deserve a visit. Unless there are particular attachments or reasons to bring you to Naples we would leave it for another voyage when you can devote as much time as it probably deserves in its grandiose dimensions and size. Naples has too much to handle comfortably in more than one large basket of places to visit. In other words in Naples there is much to miss or not find time to see because of obligations to go elsewhere.
"Hello, naples needs some day to visit all: museums,churches, monuments online you will find all. What I suggest you is to spend two or three days in Ischia where I live because is the perfect beach solution and also a trekking destination, thermal bath and much more. If you will decide to come here I could help you to visit everything."
"We are not really interested in visiting indoor spaces this time, more to do outdoor activities, outdoor sightseeing, seaside activities and so on. What are the recommendations?"
"If you’re wanting outdoors activities/sites and beaches I’d suggest some combination of the amalfi coast, islands and the ruins sites south of Naples.We love Naples and there is plenty to do (indoors and outdoors!) if you stayed there. We did a kayaking tour along the bay which was amazing.South of Naples you can hike up Vesuvius (though a bus takes you most of the way, you’re at the top for about 90 mins and it’s not exactly a big hike - still worthwhile!). You can also do horse riding tours on the slopes of Vesuvius. In that area you also have, of course, the famous ruins sites which are all outdoors - pompeii snd Herculaneum are the best known but we also loved villa oplontis and are keen to visit stabiae and boscoreale.Continuing south you get to the amalfi coast. We loved hiking around the coast - there are so many options. Plus the villages are super cute and you get some beach time (but note the beaches are pebbles, not sand). You can also do boat trips, kayak tours etc. The sorrentine peninsular is also meant to be great for hiking and coast, but I can’t speak from first hand experience. South of the amalfi coast are the temples at paestum, accessible by train from salerno.In terms of the islands, we live Capri (again for the walking, generally exploring, boat trips and the Roman ruins at Villa jovis). Capri has some lovely beach clubs, but be aware they are stone not sand - maybe google these to get an idea of what I mean. I can’t comment on ischia or procida as haven’t visited either.With a week, you could pick a single location from which you could do a combination of day trips and more local activities or two bases - one for coast and one for day tripping? I would go for the amalfi coast or one of the islands for some beach time, walking etc and either sorrento or Naples as a base to do more in the way of site seeing."
Thank you so much! Your tips are really helpful!Anybody knows how is the situation with COVID-19 in the region? Are there many restrictions now?
