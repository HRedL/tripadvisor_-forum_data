Any idea if we can get our money back for our multiple lift tickets purchased?
No - you will only get that info from where you got your ticketsBC has not yet shut down so do not expect to get your money back.
"Well as travel between provinces has not been stopped, don't expect any money back."
Incorrect!Just received full refund from Whistler Blackcomb.
Excellent - good on Whistler for coming through!
“12:12 p.m. Any idea if we can get our money back for our multiple lift tickets purchased?”“2:12 p.m. Just received full refund from Whistler Blackcomb.”Is impatience a virtue in Ottawa?
T4timYou really need a hobby.
Lol...I have one and you're it.
"I’m in Whistler with my teenage boy for our annual ski trip. We flew in on Thursday from California. According to the US department of embassy and consular, travel to Canada is a level 1- nothing of concern. There is nothing happening here that should concern travelers. If anything, US tourists are the risk to Canadians as we have many more cases of COVID-19.The hype in the US is out of control. While the situation is serious, some of the response and measures being taken by my fellow citizens are based on news media outlets competing with each other for who can come up with the most sensational headlines. The information on CDC.gov gives straightforward advice and data.I’m not saying I was right coming on this trip or anyone is wrong to cancel, I just hope people consider their choice to travel or not, base it on their situations and not influenced, sensationalized data. Cheers, Brie"
"“US tourists are the risk to Canadians as we have many more cases of COVID-19.” And that is the issue. Why risk exposing others just for for their own pleasure? This is how the virus keeps spreading around the world.“base it on their situations and not influenced, sensationalized data”So your department of state and all expert advice against unnecessary travel is sensationalized data? People have to start acting responsibly to limit the spread of the disease and not just think of themselves. The attractions will still be there, just visit them later when things have calmed down.."
#9 Brie: do you realize that the BC Provincial Health Officer Dr Bonnie Henry has indicated that all persons coming across the Canadian border into BC should go into self-isolation (self-quarantine) for 14 days.Doesn't seem like you are doing this.
"The best protection we can get is by not having those from high risk areas arriving. To any others considering the trip because Canada is a low risk area, please be mindful that for Canadians, Americans visiting are high risk. Take care of your neighbours, don’t expose them."
"@ #11 Agree. sadly too many people say “not me” and ignore all recommendations made by authorities...and the disease keeps spreading. Selfish.Edited: 3:13 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"For those visiting Whistler (indeed, Canada) arriving from outside of Canada during COVID-19 pandemic... Self-isolation:https:/…covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html"
"Anyone coming from the US, on a nonessential trip right now, is putting themselves in a potentially hostile environment, so why advertise your presence? Saying “There is nothing happening here (Whistler) that should concern travelers,” is not responsible, is tantamount to inviting others and ratchetting up the resentment.Here is why; Seattle vs Vancouver:https://youtu.be/lksdfnKEpTwEdited: 5:19 pm, March 14, 2020 "

"What about accommodation booked through Boooking.com with a non-refundable clause Booked from overseas in January Due to no cruise ships no flights into the country do you think the ""Host ""should refund the $900 or keep it ? If they accept anyone arriving from overseas into their accommodation they must self-isolate for 14 daysI'm sure many people will loose money over this lack of reasoningEdited: 11:22 am, March 17, 2020 "
"You really should be going to the source for the answer. Asking a dozen strangers on here , will get you two dozen answers."
"satrowe ~You say you are from Vancouver. Are you asking for a friend of yours who is overseas?Booking.com is who the booking was made with. They are the online travel agent. The cancellation must be made with Booking.com.I found this statement: << Every Online Travel Agency has their own policies on cancellations. Some, but not all, are making special exceptions due to coronavirus. >>in this page: https:/…index.htmlI don't see anything about refunds due to the Corona Virus in the booking.com website.Booking.com, along with some other OTA's offer cheaper hotel rates and flights but they don't offer very good customer service. Some customers who are trying to get refunds from Booking.com are waiting on the phone for hours to speak to an agent.The Corona virus, including the need to self-isolate, seems to have made it possible for non refundable accommodation costs to be refunded. Booking.com ask that you call about 72 hours before your stay..@Brie ~You arrived quite legitimately to Whistler on the 12th. Vail did not close their NA resorts until the 12th, closing their properties on the last check out on March 20th. Trudeau did not restrict the border until the 16th. You might even have returned home by now, if you were staying a week. I'm petty sure no one has been hostile to you. I expect you have been taking the same precautions that we are all taking - social distancing, not joining in groups of over 50, hand washing. Whether you are here or in the States, the same health advisories apply to all of us."
