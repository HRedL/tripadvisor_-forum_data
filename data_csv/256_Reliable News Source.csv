"Hello,What is a reliable news source for London news? Asking because I have an upcoming trip and I see so many conflicting reports. The number of affected people is low; but, some ""news"" outlets are reporting temporary morgue setups and others are reporting a ""lockdown"" similar to Italy's.Thank you!"
Well....you could carry on with Fox or use the BBC.Where do you get this garbage?
"Stay away from the Daily Mail, Daily Express, Daily Star and The S*n and you should be okay!"
"Some ""news"" outlets are reporting it is spread by 5G and 8% of Americans believe they have been abducted by aliens. I'm still struggling to find a table for one in Fitzrovia tonight so I guess the Zombie Apocalypse hasn't arrived yet."
"Bear in mind that every local authority in the UK will have an emergency planning function. Things like how to deal with more than the usual numbers of deaths are included in these plans and yes, there will be one for London but it won’t have been invented solely for this crisis.Here is the official government information site. https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…"
"If you are wanting specific information about Coronavirus and government/ public health England then this link provides the up to date infohttps:/…coronavirus-covid-19-list-of-guidanceOr the BBC news page is a pretty good source. For newspapers would suggest the Guardian online (no subscription for this) some of the other papers have a subscription element.Basically you want what is known here as the broadsheet papers as opposed to tabloid press. Names based on size of the paper. The tabloid press mentioned are Daily Express, Daily Mail, Sun and Daily Star. Would also add the Mirror to this list."
"BBC,Temporary Morgues?"
"""Temporary Morgues?""Blame the Supreme Leaderhttps://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/one-in-f…"
"The local London newspaper is the Evening Standard, and another more reputable newspaper is the Independent.https://www.standard.co.uk/https://www.independent.co.uk/The TV news outlets also have websites (Channel 4 News, Sky News).https://www.channel4.com/news/https://news.sky.com/ukBBC News has a specific London page.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/england/london"
"Ive been looking at the sites below for updates, advice and figures. Dr John Campbell Channel. (Gillianuk linked this recently)https://www.youtube.com/watch…Worldometer https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Edited: 4:34 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"The number of deaths so far is not relevant to your trip planning, so don't waste your time looking.Lockdowns, closures, etc are based on projections of of the *future* spread of the disease, not on what's already occurred.You need to keep an eye on Google News, as individual closure decisions have been made with minimal notice, and this is likely to continue.You should also keep an eye on your own country's official travel recommendations and on any action taken where you come from, as it's quite possible at this stage that some form of check or quarantine will be forced on you when returning home."
"Unfortunately there is no ""one"" reliable news source. Read widely and check against other sources.Government, of any country, websites will give you official information. Whether you choose to believe that is up to you.The BBC is no less or more biased than other organisations but is still a pretty good starting point for UK info. Social media is, in general, best ignored."
“ The S*n”—-That reference will probably be lost on anyone outside the U.K.
"""That reference will probably be lost on anyone outside the U.K.""Yes, seems odd to miss out a letter.For anyone who isn't aware it is toilet paper with writing on it."

"GoTigahsFinding a newspaper or TV station giving true unbiased news is virtually impossible in most countries including your own . This is because news is generated by human beings who all see things from a different perspective and put a slant on it to suit their own views ( often political)To say the Independent is any better than any other paper is wrong as they report things the way they want to. Many UK papers and the BBC are having difficulty reporting Government successes because they wanted the other guy and his party to win.as for the virus, every Council has always had emergency plans for epidemics which always include a worse scenario"
Many UK papers and the BBC are having difficulty reporting Government successes because they wanted the other guy and his party to win.—————————-So which papers were these then? I think there’s a very good reason why not many government successes are being reported.
The Evening Standard is available free at bus and train stops.
"Most of the news media here is sadly owned by Rupert Murdoch and have their own agenda.I avoid the Daily Mail, extremely bigotted and one sided, appeals to non thinkers and sells well. It's like Fox News. Main news media on telly is BBC and Sky News. Watch both. Haven't heard of the morgues, sounds like Facebook stuff to me.I don't think you should travel if you're genuinely that worried, I wouldn't. A good friend from Rayleigh, Essex cancelled coming into London last Saturday as she didn't want to catch the coronavirus. I said I would travel to Essex and meet her in Southend but she declined stating that there had been a spate of stabbings in Southend and she declined my offer.My point is, if you're so petrified of travelling to London, don't come.Edited: 11:25 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Every sensible country has a plan in place for a pandemic of an infectious disease. This has long been known as a top risk for economies and societies.
I think we’ve all assumed the OP is referring to Coronavirus but maybe s/he means mass shootings or terrorist attacked or abductions by spaceships from other planets.
"brittraveller.Getting Brexit through and winning the election to name the main two successes.The BBC and the ""quality"" papers never supported these actions because they felt they knew better than the electorate"
"Avoid the Dailies Sun, Mail, Times, Telegraph, Express.The BBC is the best place to begin, they have a London section.The Guardian is the best online UK website it is free. It is on the left politically, though I know many on the right who read it to get an accurate picture of the news, But Coronavirus is not really a political issue."
"You can try here for the UK covid-19 infection map:https:/…f94c3c90da5b4e9f9a0b19484dd4bb14Edited: 4:36 am, March 11, 2020 "
">>The BBC and the ""quality"" papers never supported these actions<<It's not the BBC's job to support government policies, still less a political party's election campaign."
"Getting Brexit through and winning the election to name the main two successes.The BBC and the ""quality"" papers never supported these actions because they felt they knew better than the electorate————————————————————-Really? The Telegraph and The Times didn’t report on the outcome of the GE? Which of them was supporting the other one then?Also, winning a GE is a success for a political party. Success in government is a different matter.Edited: 5:42 am, March 11, 2020 "
"The most reliable news sources - and none are perfect - are those that involve scientific opinion. All news media exaggerate. We dont yet have lockdowns, they may happen if cases increase so rapidly our health services can not cope. At present that hasnt happened but it may change any day.We have emergency plans based on the worst possible case - no-one actually expects that to happen because supplies of hand sanitiser are selling out as fast as they arrive, people are mostly taking this seriously."
It would be very surprising if the US government does not have plans to deal with any number of emergencies. The item about setting up a morgue in Hyde Park was merely a part of the UK government's emergency plan should the virus situation cause a vast number of deaths.
>>> Many UK papers and the BBC are having difficulty reporting Government successes because they wanted the other guy and his party to win.<<<Initially I thought this was posted with tongue firmly in cheek but was dismayed to see the follow up post #21.
The bid advantage of reading the tabloids is that they are a lot more entertaining and cause less worry about world events. You still get all the important information about obscure members of the royal families trials and tribulations.
"The BBC certainly gave de Ppeffel Johnson as easy ride at the general electionSo many questions not asked about his lying past, failures as London Mayor and Foreign Secretary"
"My point about coverage was being ""unbiased"" and the BBC and Channel 4 could not say they did not lean towards the Labour party.As for newspapers perhaps the OP should look at the sales figures of UK newspapers. That might give some indication as to which newspaper the UK population thinks gives the best coverage."
"I avoid the BBC, extremely bigotted and one sided,"
"""I avoid the BBC, extremely bigotted and one sided""I don't find it to be that, I just think it is not as good as it likes to think it is. What do you recommend?"
"What do you recommend?Read everything, even The Sun and The Guardian, the truth lies somewhere in the middle"
">>As for newspapers perhaps the OP should look at the sales figures of UK newspapers. That might give some indication as to which newspaper the UK population thinks gives the best coverage.<<Of the cat's litter tray, maybe."
Read everything but avoid the BBC?How does that work?
"I avoid the BBC, extremely bigotted and one sided,———————————Indeed they are. They even had Farage on Newsnight this week, giving his opinion on Covid19."
"I have subscribed to The Guardian for about two years. Really enjoy their Culture section and read all the news of theatre openings, museum exhibits, etc. Political coverage seems fair enough IMHO (as I lean a bit left anyway) but I read most of it each morning including some of the pretty wacky and no-holds-barred pieces. I like knowing there is so much more happening in the world beyond the D.C. Beltway. Also, I am a huge fan of the BBC. For theatre reviews, I read most of them in all the major papers if it's a show I plan to see. The Guardian has ""live"" pieces throughout the day some days which I tap into when time permits. When I am visiting, I read whatever is on hand. Love the British press as it is such a departure from home."
"""I avoid the BBC, extremely bigotted and one sided""And yet they were accused of bias by both the left and the right which IMHO suggests they must be doing something right.And to lighten the mood a bit, here's a classic clip from the BBC comedy, Yes Prime Minister about who reads British newspapers.https://youtu.be/DGscoaUWW2M"
"Basically, everybody is recommending media outlets that reflect ther own views."
Thank you Mick for bringing a bit of light relief with that clip.If you really wanted to get an overview of political news in this country you'd need to read papers which have different political leanings and understand as you read them all have their own spin on the stories.To get the latest info on the Coronavirus situation then the mainstream news channels BBC / Sky / Channel4 will have the up to date situation.
ITV news have an interactive map showing the number of cases reported in Health Board Areas.https:/…

"On the virus issue the BBC is fine. Their reporting of it has been generally impartial and informative. That’s because there is very little difference between the political parties on the virus response. Generally speaking (even Corbyn’s) Labour is supportive of the government. When a genuine emergency hits, the British pull together. Next year could be very different and back to bias (depending on your political leanings). But on this issue the Beeb is doing well."
>>the British pull together.<<I wouldn't be so sure of that.
"When a genuine emergency hits, the British ̶ ̶p̶u̶l̶l̶ ̶t̶o̶g̶e̶t̶h̶e̶r̶.̶ ̶ fight each other over toilet rolls."
"after the initial anger over toilet rolls (when they were freely available a short drive away) my local area now has people volunteering to collect medication for, deliver food to and generally help the elderly. Went shopping recently and a large pile of toilet rolls inside the supermarket entrance. We didnt fill the trolley. Food bank box was full last week, although not with toilet rolls, as unfortunately the need for it is increasing. Visited our favourite pub for lunch and it was as busy as ever. Parts of Britain still pull together."
"<< Their reporting of it has been generally impartial and informative. >>Although the ""Health Expert"" on Question Time last night showed the BBC's true bias."
"For someone avoiding the bigoted BBC, you sure do seem to love watching it!"
">>Although the ""Health Expert"" on Question Time last night showed the BBC's true bias.<<Meaning...? It may have escaped your notice that Question Time isn't an editorial comment by the BBC but a collection of people with different personal opinions."

"Strange for me to agree with Amos but much of what he has said is true.The balance of the audience on QT has generally been claimed to be left wing sided . On the odd occasion I have watched it I remember one guy on the panel pointing out that out of the 5 on the stage he was the only pro Brexit and at the time that was ""the topic of the day""I think that this post has run it's course as all it has proved is the diverse opinions of where to get accurate news"
And that one person was probably Farage who has never offered any resolutions to the problems of this country.
"Plenty of other QT guests (especially the ""celebrity ""ones ) have never offered any resolutions to the problems of this country."
