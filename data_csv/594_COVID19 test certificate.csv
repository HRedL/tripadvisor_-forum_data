"We plan to travel to Mykonos at end of September 2020 after spending 2 nights near Rafina. After 3 nights in Mykonos we travel by ferry to Santorini for 3 nights before flying back to Athens. In the event that a negative COVID19 test certificate is required for Santorini by this stage, is there someone that does this in Mykonos? Any idea of cost? Hoping it doesn't come to this, because after paying for a certificate to access Mykonos plus another certificate to access Santorini would be problematic and could be expensive."
"A COVID19 test certificate is £200 (€222) per person for us. I'm not sure we can proceed with our trip now. It's a pity the COVID19 test certificates were not more reasonably priced.Edited: 2:08 am, August 11, 2020 "
"DollyWhy do you think you need to produce a negative test to get into santorini, or indeed into anywhere in Greece? You are tested on arrival in Greece, not at each island. If you are travelling from the U.K. then at this time you don’t need to provide a test result. You will complete a form before you travel and the Greeks will test you at their expense on arrival if they choose to."
"DollyAre you entering Greece by some means other than air, or not directly from the U.K.?"
"VegasShowgirl, I'll be entering from Ireland. I'm fully aware at present the certificate is not a requirement. I'm wondering down the line, when I'm travelling at the end of September, if the negative COVID19 certificate requirement will be extended to other countries including UK and Ireland. Just sussing out our options."
#5. Hi Dolly. My thoughts exactly. We're hopefully going to one of the other islands mid September and if the PLF business is not extended after August 31st and the infection rate keeps rising ( which is more than likely ) then I think it equally likely that the negative test approach could easily be extended to the UK.If so I dont think my other half would agree to the test unless the cost comes down considerably.All conjecture atm. Fingers crossed :-))
"Hi Dolly, I am also prone to speculation and thinking three steps ahead but I think you might be hasty ruling out the whole trip on this basis. The end of September is a long time away in pandemic terms. Even my trip at the end of August is also. Lots of things can change in that time frame. All you can do is book things that are fully cancellable until as late as possible and be prepared to wait for a refund when/if an airline cancels.My own speculation is that if the UK figures got bad enough for Greece to want covid test certificates ( as opposed to targeted testing like now ) , then our holidays are pretty doomed anyhow. As in airlines cancelling and UK closing borders in and out. So I wouldn't make decisions based on the cost of a possible covid test certificate. For now, keeping positive and trying to get the balance between not getting hopes too high and looking forward to the holiday is the best state of mind. Not easy and I know it."
"""My own speculation is that if the UK figures got bad enough for Greece to want covid test certificates ( as opposed to targeted testing like now ) , then our holidays are pretty doomed anyhow. As in airlines cancelling and UK closing borders in and out. ""I wouldn't say this is necessarily the case.In Belgium, f.ex., the second wave is slowing down since a few days - meaning infections are still on the rise but at a far slower rate than say two weeks ago, and infections in the main COVID-hotspot Antwerp are actually starting to decline. So one could say things are 'starting to get better' - however relative.Yet it is only yesterday that Greece decided we need to present a negative test result when travelling to Greece. And there has been no talk yet of closing borders or airlines cancelling their flights.So basically: it is what is is. I don't think it's possible at all to predict what's going to happen."
"UnaW, I'm trying to stay optimistic. Unfortunately my flights, which I paid £800 for are with Ryan Air, booked prior to the pandemic. Ryan Air will fly despite any FCO advice. I don't meet criteria for rebooking without change cost. Accommodation is all free cancellation. Fingers crossed it all works out."
"I think it is very unlikely to require a negative COVID test to move from one island to another . More likely is to require it in order to move from one country to another (eg from Greece to Italy). As far as I known there is a clinic called Mykonian Hygeia Polyclinic that is operating two molecular analysers on the Island. They give certificates to many tourists traveling to Italy , Dubai. They charge 150€."
