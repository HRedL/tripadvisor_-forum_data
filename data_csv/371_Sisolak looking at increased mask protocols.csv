"Per Sisolak Facebook page today-“ Nevada Health Response has repeatedly urged the use of face coverings when out in public as one of the strongest methods of mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and directives signed by Gov. Steve Sisolak mandate the use of face coverings by employees who interact with the public. As the State evaluates the latest COVID data in Nevada and around the country for potential next steps in the state’s phased reopening plans, Gov. Sisolak is asking the Medical Advisory Team to evaluate potential options for enhanced face covering policies in Nevada and provide any recommendations for consideration to strengthen Nevada’s response to this global pandemic.”"
"I figured as much which is one of the reasons I booked immediately. When crazy CA does something, the surrounding states tend to play follow the leader. Worst case I'll check out early or if it happens en-route, just head to Harrah's AK-Chin again."
I thought they renamed it Harrah’s AK-Mask?
Probably not a coincidence that yesterday California tightened their mandatory mask requirements.
"i figured it's just a matter of timeif people who were old and/or immuocompromised people who know they're going to be around those populations, and people with any symptoms would do what they're supposed to (not travel and self quarantine), draconian measures like this wouldn't be necessary. ibecause of their stupidity and the stupidity of crazy people who think the entire world should cater to their stupidity, hundreds of millions of us citizens have to pay even though the WHO has made it very clear that people who are asymptomatic have a beyond infinitesimal chance of spreading the disease at all. ianyway, i doubt sisolak will implement any new protocols in the next few days while i'm there, and i'll still go in august if i have to wear a mask anywhere."
Is there any recent evidence that shows that wearing a mask is either less effective or no more effective at slowing the spread than not wearing a mask? Especially when people are indoors or in close confines?
"@goodbeerThere are studies that show both sides. The problem is that studies can be easily manipulated to get a desired outcome. It is very easy. That is what happened with the IHME numbers that originally scared people so badly. The data was basically garbage, this was admitted. If what you put into it is crap, what comes out can only be crap. We aren't in a world that values true science anymore but marketing, PR, and sales."
"What’s the point fighting it? In California, you must wear a mask going to any stores, banks and restaurants, or else you cannot go in. You must wear mask. You can keep on debating, nothing you say mean anything nor influence the rules. You only choice is to stay home. It’s special time in a global crisis, all you are asked to do is to wear a mask in the public. You are not to fight a war, or risk your life or money, just wear a mask. You can’t even do that?"
"Well I do believe in science based medicine, it’s how I make my living. I havent followed the mask clinical trials but do believe there is validity behind the reasons people suggest to wear masks in the situations I state above. I know it doesn’t hurt. Kind of like locking my car door when I park, the car easily can still get broken into but locking the door is a deterrent.I’m not one of those that thinks this virus jumps from one person to another like fleas. Just by walking by someone who is infected. We have had dine in restaurants and bars open for 5 weekends now, tonight and tomorrow will be the 5th straight week that I’ll be out enjoying them, presumably around people that were infected. A few weeks ago I had a couch delivered, a few days later the company sent me an email informing me that one of the delivery guys had tested positive, he was in my house for 10 minutes tops with a mask, I was pretty confident that exposure would be very hard to infect me so didn’t think twice about it.With all of that said I have no problem wearing a mask when I’m near others indoors and think it’s a good thing. Of course at the bar or restaurant table I remove it while seated. When I’m Outside exercising each day I carry one in my hand but don’t wear it unless I’m in a situation where another person looks uncomfortable with me not having it on. Walking by someone a arms length is more Than likely not exposing anyone long enough, especially out doors."
Draconian lol.
"Mac,My objections are not based on any difficulties or challenges wearing a mask. I flew for the first time since this ""crisis"" began and willingly and without comment put on a mask for the duration of the four flights.I've put on masks at the request of nurses when visiting people in the hospital or ill relatives at home. But those instances were not a legal requirement but a reasonable request. My objections are based on being told I (or anyone for that matter) must wear a mask.It's my view the we as Americans are subject to a limited and well define set of ""musts"" which I have done my best to adhere to but in my 56 years on this planet none of those ""musts"" included wearing a mask (and in my view never will).If a casino chooses to make mask wearing a part of their policies without the government (governing entity) requiring them to do so, then I would don a mask without objection. It is the government's involvement that I object to."
"“ We aren't in a world that values true science anymore but marketing, PR, and sales.“You forgot “ liability “. Or trying to avoid it."
"Nope Mac I can't unless I absolutely cannot find a way around it and even then half ass it so my nose isn't covered. I don't give up. If there is something I want, I eventually acquire it. Something I don't like I fight against it. What's the difference between a Californian wearing it and someone from South Dakota not? Politics. Or maybe science works differently there."
@Goodbeer I'd actually enjoy providing a thoughtful and detailed reply and to continue our conversation. It will probably be tomorrow sometime.
"For some science is hard. Then again the earth may be flat.

"I wear mask when needed, bank or markets, now restaurants are open, I will wear it. Same reason I wear seat belts, because it is the law. It is my duty to be a responsible citizen of my community.I don’t wear mask at home, in car or in my office, but I put it on when I step out in presence of other people. The mask I wear often was homemade by a staff, cloth mask, which we all know doesn’t really block much. Works or not is not important to me, I do it because I must by law and as a social obligation, and just being polite and considerate, what a gentleman should do. I even think it is patriotic, I do it for my country, the great country. It is not hard. If you don’t, fine with me. I am too lazy and too old to care or judge others."

">>the WHO has made it very clear that people who are asymptomatic have a beyond infinitesimal chance of spreading the disease at all.<<sorry, that's incorrect. thanks for playing; we'll send you a copy of our home game, which we recommend you actually play at home, where you'll be safe.there's an amazing amount of foolishness and false patriotism in this thread from the mask defying crowd. apparently, wearing a mask is believed to be some sort of sign of weakness or a violation of fundamental freedoms. hmmm.. i wonder why people think that. and if i actually read what i thought i read, it has been posited early on in this thread that the spread of the virus is due to older people (who may be well) and people with compromised immune systems who travel and don't stay home... if i'm reading this correctly, the spread of the virus is not because people who are asymptomatic and not wearing a mask may be spreading the virus. no, it's because others may be in their path to catch the virus. that is one astonishing piece of twisted logic: it's not the people spreading the disease, it's the people catching it that are the problem. wow! if only those asymptomatic disease spreaders were left to roam free, what a wonderful world this would be, as long as people were smart enough to stay out of their way. (also, it should be noted that it is not only older people and those with compromised autoimmune systems who are susceptible to COVID-19 or who die from the disease. )and, again, just in case you weren't following along in your hymnal... the people who catch the virus are being branded as ""stupid"" and selfish, not the people who refuse to do - literally - the simplest thing one could be asked to do... wear a mask.remarkable."
"Yeah, look at all the cool guys that wear masks: Spiderman, Darth Vader, V, Iron Man, DTC, Rorschach, Jamborino, UKstages.C'mon.. wear a mask."

"@ ESPN,Re your claim that: ""if people who were old and/or immuocompromised people ... would do what they're supposed to (not travel and self quarantine), draconian measures like this wouldn't be necessary.""What they are supposed to do? And according to who?... You and your wish to travel unfettered by any such limitations, while others stay home? No such order has been given by the government. The most common guidelines that states have introduced are to maintain social distancing, and to mask when social distancing is not possible, or in crowded indoor spaces.And re, your claim that: ""because of their stupidity and the stupidity of crazy people who think the entire world should cater to their stupidity, hundreds of millions of us citizens have to pay even though the WHO has made it very clear that people who are asymptomatic have a beyond infinitesimal chance of spreading the disease at all.""What stupidity? The stupidity of needing to go and buy groceries, and following guidelines by masking and social distancing when doing so? The stupidity of following such guidelines when travelling? No. what you are talking about is the fact that you just don't want to look around and see masks around you when you visit Vegas for your third or so trip, or have anything feel less than completely normal for your holiday. But I've got news for you. Things are not normal yet, and won't be until adequate precautions are taken and start to have their effect. And ""beyond infinitesimal"" is a complete self-serving exaggeration (as you often do) about what the WHO actually said. Cite a source if you want to make such claims.And continuing to call people who go about their life while following guidelines, ""crazies"" or ""look at me look at me's"" or saying ""politicians aren't people"" won't make the situation better. It will just make the actual underlying situation worse. But hey, what do you care... You're only ever focused on you, and your next Vegas trip. And you fellow citizens don't matter. They are just ""crazies""."

"New York had a full scale outbreak in March. Arizona wasn't hit hard at all. Since then NY has been cautious about reopening, follows the guidelines and the majority of people wear masks. Arizona opened up while ignoring the guidelines and mask wearing was ignored as well.Yesterday New York had a positive test rate of 1 percent.Yesterday Arizona had a positive test rate of 20 percent."
"I should note, I was quite anti-mask myself as little as a week ago. Who knows how well they work? But the numbers don't lie. I'm going to wear a mask now and not complain about it."
