"HelloWith every country’s health insurers rewriting coverages, federal and private with respect to travel.Airline unprecedented layoffs, routes essentially continuing to be scaled back to even essential routes suspended..Governments telling everyone not to travel.Our travel club with large physician and attorney membership, prediction is at least 24 months.Mexico hesitated much too long to organize a sufficient protection plan for the country.What is your prediction?Be safe everyone.Regards"
"Mexico will probably be sold to Guatemala in exchange for a bottle of hand sanitizer and a dozen face masks for lack of preparation.That's my prediction.Edited: 9:28 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"“ Mexico hesitated much too long to organize a sufficient protection plan for the country.”We would like to know which country did not wait too long. Mexico has come down very strongly on staying at home and social distancing. Even the police in Huatulco are advising and encouraging the elderly and medically compromised folks to do so.We are hoping that the recovery in Huatulco will be quick, especially now that evidence is pointing to hot and humid weather having an impact on COVID19’s ability to be transmitted. Time will tell.CH"
"Thanks CasaHoffa I'm impatient sometimes. I don't think there's a single success story in this pandemic. Every region has a tragedy, every life lost is for nothing.There are heroes sacrificing life and limb in order for others to live and then there's us, sitting at home doing nothing except pointing fingers and bickering with ignorance and intolerance, thinking we know better than everyone and thinking we could change the outcome with a smartphone.I don't know what's gonna happen, but one thing for sure, none of us do. That's really my prediction."
If only we knew. But I do hope things normalize fairly quickly because I have so many local Mexican friends that want to go back to work. Only time will tell...
I am not very optimistic for the next winter season. A vaccine is 1 year minimum away from being put into use. That is too late for this coming tourist season.

"HelloI agree with Mike. China basically hid the outbreak for 3-4 months that should have been the benchmark. Hopefully not, there is a high probability that Mexico may have scattered hot spots for years to come. 24 months may indeed be a wishful hope. Here in the USA airlines are now suspending basic regional flights.The virus doesn’t travel on its own, people traveling spread the virus. Be safe everyone Regards"
"I know you agree with Mike :) Pat. And I know that your post is not intended to ask when people want to resume their vacations or how they feel about this horrible tragedy. This is one of many posts to speculate not what the pandemic will cause in terms of damage to humanity, but who can we blame, and while we're at it why not blame the Chinese and their global hegemony, and why not blame the Mexicans and that incompetent clown they have for a president?People are more transparent than you think, Pat."
"HelloMiguel A I am doing what I can for stopping this outbreak, I am helping others retrieving essential necessities such as groceries prescriptions etc. this is not a blame game. It is simply a conversation of what has led up to our fight to stop the outbreak.I only hope the best for everyone. People need to examine their daily and future plans and to get through this without incurring any further suffering and inconvenience casualties.Be safe everyone.Regards"
"@Mike:) Ok let's take this a step at a time. ""There was a straight forward question with a straight forward answer.""Can you please point out which question you answered?""If the truth is something that upsets you, I am sorry.""If you can't see the sheer arrogance of this statement, you may need to take a moment and reflect on what exactly makes whatever you say, a truth just because you say so. This is a fascinating conversation Mike :) Stay with me."
"@Pat, I may have misjudged your motivation. Then again, it's funny you decide to just reply to my posts, when people in the thread have pointed at similar problems.I sincerely appreciate what you say you do, I just want to point something out to you:I'm Mexican, I live here and my family lives here. It's not like we come here for vacation. We will live with the consequences of our actions or lack thereof and yet, we stand by the decisions of our Health Secretary not out of blind obedience, but because we don't have to wait for them to tell me what to do. Me and my family self-isolate since the beginning of March. However, we don't feel the compulsion to denounce other countries' handling of the contingence because we're too busy taking care of ourselves, and any energy directed to judgment or criticism is more politically motivated than anything else. Finally, having Americans, Canadians or what have you, who don't live here and just come seasonally or maybe not even that, seems like a misdirection of energy. I would recommend both of you to find your home countries' Trip Advisor forums and try to contribute your opinions and perhaps they will be better received there.Other than that, thank you for your concern."
"HelloMiguel A, most everyone appreciates and adore visiting Mexico. Many often carry needed supplies and donate to their destination of choice. Your president appears to be making many wrong decisions. I find it outrageous with this virus outbreak his last visit to Sinaloa, he took the time to greet El Chapo’s mother. With continuous corruption within Mexico including every country, you have to ask yourself is the Mexican president owned by some unruly group.Also I read the Mexican English news, with the link below hopefully you can understand what everyone sees.https://mexiconewsdaily.com/Let’s all work together.I hope the best for you and the entire world.Stay safe Regards"
"Hey you guys thanks. Yeah you both have a bone to pick, and it's politically motivated and if you can't see that I'll have to quote our epistemologist-in-chief Mike :):""If the truth™ is something that upsets you, I am sorry. "". That is a fact.""~Mike :)Sorry guys, that was fun but I gotta go tell my president to stop being so soft on the 'rona."
"For what it is worth, I don't think it is safe to travel anywhere these days. Italy, Spain, and more recently the US, especially New York, are brutally unsafe. Travel in Canada is not advised either. I may be overly pessimistic about COVID, but I don't see a real solution until there is a vaccine. The travel industry has been hit with a ton of bricks. I didn't realize that TripAdvisor was investor owned, but I did see it come up while watching a business channel. It showed that TripAdvisor stock is down 50%!"
"Predictions at this point ,would be better described as wild guesses"

"I heard some pretty scary statistics in the US presser today. It was stated that in New York 35% of tests were coming back positive. And states that were considered low were in the range of 10% positive. This compares to Alberta in Canada where testing has been coming back consistently at 2% for some time. I have to conclude that this outbreak is very serious in the US, and is even worse in New York. New York would be about the last place in the world I would go to today. They are in a mess. In Mexico we just don't know what is going on. In the absence of testing things tend to look much better than they really are."
"Because of a limited number of tests available, my area has only been testing those with symptoms. In areas where more people can be tested, the percentage of those infected will be lower."
"Forget the ""test"" data, it is being skewed by a number of factors, mostly though by the estimated 20-25% of folks who show no symptoms (and are not being tested) but are infecting others. We say, assume you are infected and change your behavior to not infect others: social distancing, stay home if you are in a high risk group....CHEdited: 8:09 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Hola Miguel A. Just a quick note to say that most of us agree with what you are saying. Sometime ago, we realized that having a rational discussion with (anonymous) irrational folks is a waste of time. We block those folks and have nothing to do with them.Good luck to you and yours in MC!CHEdited: 8:21 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Yeah thanks CasaHoffa that's nice of you. I see the discussion moved on to the subject of testing, which I know very little about so I'll try to do some reading. The problem with information is very simple: we believe what we want to believe. The Dunning-Kruger is strong.Anyway has anybody noticed something mind blowing? In Mexico there's almost as many 'recovered' cases as there are 'active'? 559 recovered vs 782 active:https://bing.com/covid/local/mexicoOh I forgot Mexico is doing nothing about the matter, sorry."
"Unfortunately our politicians (and the medical people under their direction) have not been willing to recommend masks. I believe the reason is that they know they do not have enough for just the medical people treating COVID cases, let alone the general public. We are now in a state that I would be highly resistant to wearing a mask for fear of the social stigma. Some would be quick to think I had hoarded a supply of masks that should have gone to the medical people more at risk. And others would think I have COVID and would call 911 to turn me in. I tuned in to the US presser today because the rumor was that Trump was going to announce that all or virtual all US people had to wear a mask to go outside. When asked, he skated around the question and passed it off to his doctor who did even more skating...I think will we not be given the facts until there really are enough masks to go around... and that could be months away. I think Justin will not get much sleep tonight in fear of what Ford is going to reveal tomorrow with Ontario's projection of COVID deaths."
"My prediction is ""uncertainty"". Doesn't take a genius to arrive at that. Can we all commit to reading CDC, WHO and reliable local news at least once per day? Social media is not a reliable source.The Coronavirus is expected to ebb and flow for up to 24 months. And ebb is is the best outcome. Rip off the bandage and get it over with fast may seem most desirable economically, but that is a devastating scenario. No nations heath care system can deal with a huge spike. SLOW the spread, follow official guidance. Ask yourself this: If I were infected and had severe symptoms (unable to breathe without a ventilator) would I want to be in a calm hospital with few cases or an overwhelmed hospital? Don't add to the overwhelm!Yeah, it's uncomfortable now. Deal with it. Discomfort now is a prettier picture than discomfort later if we don't comply with preventative measures.I too have dealt with trip cancellations. It stinks. But it is what it is. Let's stop CV19 together."
HelloMexico president still oblivious to threatening virus outbreak.https://mexiconewsdaily.com/President Obrador please look after your citizens!https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/ame…Be safe everyRegards
"Nothing to see here, folks. Just another spammy post from the revered Mexico News Daily. Pat Y, I did convey your deep concern for the wellbeing of the Mexican people to President Obrador and he assured me that he will look into the source of your anguish just as soon as he's done with his brunch. No need to contact any further, he received all your frequent messages.PD: Folks, don't bother clicking on that link, it's last week's news and it's just a political editorial."
Back to the 'return to normal' prediction I understand that without a clear timeline for vaccine herd immunity may have effect sometime later in the decade.
"Unfortunately AMLO is unable to balance the economy with the threat of the virus just like Trump. You are living in Mexico city and will likely see a New York type scenario in the next 4-6 weeks or sooner. I flew into Mexico City March 13 (out on 3/19) and looking at the density of the city I thought there is a huge potential of a bad scenario with this virus. I hope I am wrong. I love Mexico City and have spent time there a couple of dozen times. Best wishes for you, your family and the residents of Mexico city!"
Would you rather have EPN or Calderon of maybe FOX or 70 more years of the PRI? Although I disagree with AMLO's handling of COVID-19 he has been popular with the majority of the Mexican people. In some ways he reminds me of Bernie Sanders here in the USA with his heart in the right place.
"Hi @JohnPCrow that's nice of you. My point really is that I prefer to keep the predictions to scientists and politics to politicians. A lot of people here use this forum as their little bigotry Facebook soapbox instead of focusing on travel. It's funny really, except there's a lot of toxic threads. It's the demographics of Mexico tourist industry. Have a nice evening."
"Oh my, all this speculation about what may be or not in Huatulco, and mostly by folks who are not even here. One thing is very real: Huatulco will return to normal this Sunday morning at 2 am when our CLOCKS WILL JUMP ONE HOUR AHEAD!!!In the mean time, wash your hands, stay at home, and practice social distancing when you need to go shopping!CH"
"HelloIt is sad that visiting friends and visiting vacation locations may never be the same. Many airlines are falling into bankruptcy. Leisure travel routes will take years to rejuvenate. Hotels are closing. Great to hear that many in Mexico are taking the needed precautions, even though their president sees things differently. Hope the large gatherings will not continue.https:/…Be safe Regards"
"Travel worlwide will never be the same. I read Trip Advisor shares have lost 50% this month.Then midsentence: ""even though their president sees things differently."" I think you're inlove with him Pat ;)Be safe out there."
I am hoping that this will result in a reduction in the number of cruise ships. They do a lot of environmental damage and they seem to be making bigger ones all the time.
"Hello Here is a news video that shows some parallels to the Mexican President. And look what happened to New York. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tNflR2Ia7HcWith Semana Santa, this week will be a tell tale of what Mexico is in for. Hopefully there will be no gatherings. People don’t like the fact that their chances of survival is linked to the common sense of others.Be safe Regards"
"The very best information and measure of this world outbreak are the grim statistics on death rates per million people. The number of cases in a country is a poor measure because it is highly influenced by the amount of testing and who is tested. The link below is to a graphical representation of this statistic. Italy is often used as an example of a worst case scenario. However this graph shows that Spain is much worse. Sweden has tried to ignore the virus with minimal to no controls and is on a trajectory that matches Italy. The US and Canada are not that much different, and are following a trajectory of deaths doubling every 3 days. Not good.So where does that leave Mexico? Mexico either due to inaccurate reporting of COVID deaths or a delayed outbreak is in the early days of the epidemic. Because this graph is logarithmic it does not start at zero, but instead starts when there are 0.1 deaths per million people. Mexico is only 7 days into this window, while the US is at 23 days, and Canada at 19 days. However the bad news is that Mexico seems to be following the same doubling every 3 days trajectory of the US and Canada. If there is no change in trajectory, Mexico could be at 100 deaths per million in just a month from now. That would be a cumulative number of 13,000 deaths. Not good.So how long does it last? It seems based on the experience of others, although some of it is considered suspect data, the curve seems to flatten out at 60 days. So perhaps in about 2 months for Mexico. Will it be over then? Not really. A vaccine is still probably a year or more away.Notice on this graph that there is a link in the bottom left corner. You can use that to turn on or turn off your choice of countries to be highlighted on the graph.https://tinyurl.com/t5vbxb7Is there any good news in this? Yes, I think so. I think the death numbers being thrown around in the US (100,000 to 200,000) and Canada (6,000 to 30,000) are much too high. I suspect the US will level off in the 120 per million range, and Canada possibly a bit lower at 100 per million. That is more like 35,000 for the US and 2,000 for Canada. I sure hope this is correct and our governments are not. In any case those are my predictions. We are not counting on being able to go to Mexico this coming winter unless there is a big surprise in the development of a vaccine.Edited: 1:29 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"Thank you for your analysis @RonAKAFor every one thing that we know about Covid-19, there's twenty that we don't know. You can say that in two months we'll be sorted or we'll be dead, it doesn't matter. The statistics and analysis available are very preliminary. If you choose to take these numbers and run, that's ok, at least your sources are legit.I recommend you post this kind of ""predictions"" on FB, where you can find a captive audience.

Read somewhere that home deaths in Italy for example are not included in national Covid reports. Guessing that home deaths in rural Mexico which include about 20% of population will be similar.
"While some people find this kind of debate informative, I for one am sick of this being a platform for people who, preciously have never contributed anything to the Huatulco TA forum beyond complaints, judgement based on no experience, outdated and inaccurate info, etc and yet still manage to contrive to get responses from normally usually contributing posters. Find a new forum, email AMLO, call your member of parliament or house representative of wherever you are from, but get off this topic and allow for for legit posters to report on the day to day issues of Huatulco, of which this forum is for. We have a great community in Hux, and these people are struggling now and in the future even more so, Practice distancing, wash your hands and everything else recommended and look to a positive further here."
"Responsible travelers are not in Mexico today. Responsible travelers are looking as to when it would be responsible and safe to go to Mexico. The US and Canada are currently highly infected with COVID-19, and if we act responsibly we will not go there and put Mexican nationals at risk."
"We agree with you, Teddy. This forum is rife with threads and posts having nothing to do with Huatulco. We would hope the “destination experts” ask TA to intervene.CH"
"I think you both have a point. What @teddy is saying is that there's travelers and residents in HUX that have more pressing issues at the moment than arguing with strangers over politics or speculation. These are expats and regular visitors instead of us who just pass by and don't have roots there. We still have a right to post, but it's not necessarily welcome cause these folks are saturated. What @Ron is saying is that foreigners should stay put in their home countries until the coast is clear. Fair point.However, some of these posts are just exhausting. Back and forth with the same whiny bickering to get attention. I'm leaving this post for now, stay safe out there!"
"HelloIs there any check points stationed on entry roads into Huatulco? Communities need to divert the traveling infected to hospitals for population protection Here is another piece showing an example.https:/…Watching our country (USA) battle this pandemic. Lets face it Mexico will soon be in deep trouble. Changing the topic to who serves the best taco and where to stay, now is not the time.

Still not as bad as the Zihua forum. Sheesh.
"Hi Pat.We are here in Huatulco and as we have already reported, the police have road blocks set up in various places. Yesterday, we got turned away entering Santa Cruz from Bahia Chahue...until we told the cop (through our masks) that we were delivering groceries to “viejos” in Ocean Park. They gave us 5 minutes to make the delivery and return to our place in Chahue. There are very few people out-and-about, mostly delivery people, cops, and folks who work in food markets.CHEdited: 10:12 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"Its great that the ""area ' around Huatulco is so tightened down. I wish we could do it so efficiently in the NY area. The Machete is mightier than the sword apparently"
Who do you think is running the roadblock? The Mayor?
Giovanne Gonzalez is the President of the Gobierno de Huatulco (City Council). The Council gives the instructions for the safety procedures and the police are responsible for enforcing the actions. They work quite well.CH

"I can appreciate the fact that Mexicans handle their affairs differently than the rest of the world, that's one of the reasons why I like Mexico.We vacationed there the first week of January. We had several conversations about what was going on in China, and when would this virus hit Canada. Most countries did not prepare properly. I think we can agree on that.To me the biggest hit on Mexico will be it neighbours with the US and that it houses many travellers. I hope the Huatulco area closed down in time.My prediction is that in Canada most of these measures will last to Christmas. We'll see the gradual reductions of these measures, but the Christmas season is busy and the officials will have us avoidling large gatherings until the new year.Mexico seems to be behind us as far as the virus spreading goes. Next winter will be a write off. I'm hoping to visit by 2022."
"Hello Hoping everyone is doing the right things to curb this virus.Thank you Casa Hoffa for the important information.Unfortunately with the global travel restrictions destinations like Huatulco airport will be very difficult to get to. The holiday leisure airlines are not expected to receive government assistance only airline giants that service the bread and butter routes may get help. Booking a direct flight to Huatulco may not happen for 2 or more years, other than limited flights out of Mexico City, most airlines are scaling down some as far as 90% all airlines are parking planes.

"Front line health care workers are subject to this infection throughout the world, including Canada and America. I have watched the progression of this post and am curious about the finger pointing at Mexico while America has been among the leaders in dropping the ball on recognizing the severity of the pandemic. Get your own glass house in order before throwing rocks at others. I hope Mexico as well as the rest of the world recovers, but it probably won't be until a vaccine is made available."
"There already were so many afraid to go to Mexico, now there will be even more afraid to travel period. I don't see this coming back to normal levels for a couple of years at the minimum. If this goes on for much longer you will be able to buy your own cruise ship for $1.29 plus tax. Sorry to answer the OP original question and not get into some debate but it was entertaining."
"Apple Vacations had a smoking hot deal for right before Thanksgiving, non-stop out of Chicago, 7 nights at Secrets for $1180. I’m not a Secrets person but that’s a pretty good deal. But I don’t have a crystal ball to know if we will be able to travel by then. I sure hope so, tho."
Air Canada and Westjet are returning some employees to their payrolls by taking advantage of the CEWS of 75% wage subsidy.Those that are recalled to active duty status will also receive full benefits.

"Until there is a vaccine or until I contract this virus and God willing recover, I have no desire to step foot on a plane to fly anywhere."
"My evolving thoughts on this question is that Mexico appears to be only 2 weeks into their outbreak, and are following a very similar trajectory as Canada. Based on the trajectory of other countries further into the outbreak, it appears the death rate does not flatten out until about the 60 day mark, and even then significant deaths are still occuring.. Seems to me that things may not settle down until mid summer. I am thinking however that it is going to be unlikely that travel companies will offer packages until a vaccine is available and a significant number of the population have been vaccinated. That pushes things into 2021 at best. I know I will not travel until I have either been vaccinated or have been tested positive for immunity. This is a good indication where things stand now.https://tinyurl.com/yx5mm9v4Edited: 5:14 pm, April 11, 2020 "

"Trip Advisor is not the best place to get predictions regarding when it will be safe to travel to Huatulco. Lots of uninformed opinions here and even the experts haven't done a great job with predicting what is going to happen with this pandemic.The journal Nature is one of the top science publications in the world and a recent article states that a vaccine might be available in 12 to 18 months if everything goes well. However, a vaccine will not be required for travel to resume again. It also depends on how things progress with respect to the persistence of the virus in the population, and the development of rapid detection devices and effective anti-virals. Don't forget that a vaccine was never developed for SARS or MERS along other viral diseases that you might encounter in Mexico (e.g Dengue and Chikungunya). It's a shame regarding that taxi driver homicide but I'm not sure that's got anything to do with COVID-19. We will know much more over the next several months as to when a trip to Huatulco will be ""safe"" again. Even then, ""safe"" is perceived on an individual basis."
"We don't know everything about COVID-19, but we do know that it is much more contagious than SARS. COVID is only now being contained due to an extraordinary world wide lockdown. All of the efforts to ""flatten the curve"" just keep people from getting in contact with the virus, which means nobody gets any immunity. Unless the lockdown is lifted in a very controlled and slow manner, we will go into a full blown epidemic again. Flight attendants are demanding masks, visors, and full body suits to work on a plane, and I don't blame them. I don't see insurance companies providing heath insurance that covers COVID, or general travel insurance until there is a vaccine. And, I don't see the likes of WestJet, Sunwing, and Transat offering packages either. I still think January 2021 is being very optimistic for normal travel to resume. I hope I am wrong!"
"Agreed. Very hard to predict what is going to happen. Our trip is booked for the first two weeks in November but I'm guessing it won't happen. However, I remain cautiously optimistic."
I always appreciate your posts!
Meant for Ron.

"If these forums were properly moderated all posts by Pat Y would be removed given her/his use of multiple screen names, harassment of others on Trip Advisor and many posts that are not travel related. It's a shame that he/she doesn't have anything better to do with his/her time."
Call me callous but the only comment I care to hear about on this forum about COVID is what is going on in Huatulco at the moment and how we can help. I get it that it’s a pandemic worldwide but I can get enough of that info on the news.

Pat Why? Why are you so obsessed ? Santa Barbara and the rest of your own country is struggling as well. Citing Fox news and other unreliable news sites on this form does little to further your xenophobic views. Hopefully the reason for your rants is a symptom of your cabin fever and not a deeper issue. Stay safe and take care of your little piece of paradise.

"HelloWell, unfortunately many predictions may be not far off. Winter leisure season 2021? Not a peep or even a thought from the insiders on the board of the air charters, with respect to point their jets towards Huatulco this year.https:/…Be safeRegards"
"HelloJust announced. If the medical researchers can work at warp speed a vaccine for the coronavirus will not be available to the public for 1 1/2-2 years. Right now it’s up to the citizens of every nation to respect and follow all guidelines necessary to contain the virus, including their own personal precautions.Mexico (and many other countries) must implement strict laws, to achieve containment. Unfortunately leisure travel in and out of Mexico is a substantially far, far reach. Predictions of federal governments, imposing restrictions to protect their citizens at home, from incoming or returning travelers may vary from country to country. But again nothing set out, these rules are a long way off.Insiders in the travel industry, see no sign of charters landing in Mexico for any non essential leisure/vacation travel.Be safeRegards"
The development of a vaccine is not the only thing that will allow for safe international travel again. It could take 1.5 - 2 years to develop a vaccine or could take less or more time. A vaccine may never be developed. No one knows for sure so to state this like a fact is misleading and incorrect.
"We agree with both Pat and Keisha: it may take 1 1/2 - 2 years (more or less) to develop a viable vaccine for COVID-19, if ever. To our knowledge no successful vaccine has ever been developed and distributed for any of the corona viruses.Going forward, in our humble opinion, the best hope for folks coming to and being able to travel in Mexico (without destroying the people here!!), are viable medication(s) available to everyone. Several are being investigated and trialed (we attended a very interesting Webinar today). Barring that, it would be tragic for international travelers to come here. IOHO.CH"
"Agreed regarding international travellers being allowed before it is safe for everyone. However, the biggest risk to Huatulco at the present time is domestic tourism. Hopefully things will remain closed for quite a while. In the interim I will keep donating to the food bank and individuals in Huatulco."
"Thank you so much for your kind contributions, Keisha!CH"
I wish I could do more. I remember buying groceries at Chedraui last November and noticing that a lot of the prices weren't that different from Canada. I'm sure life is very difficult for many people in Huatulco these days.
"I was curious about your reply CH..does this mean that you have no plans to return to NYC,or the USA in the next year to year and a half?"
"That could be Suze. We are permanent residents of Mexico and have no limit on the time we can be in Mexico. Further, unlike Canada, we have no requirement to return to the USA in order to maintain various eligibilities.We love NYC and do miss our family and friends, but for right now we feel safer in Huatulco: less population density, no shortages, more accommodating weather, easier to avoid infection.CH"

You hit the nail on the head with less population density CasaHoffa. Smaller centres with reduced populations will have much smaller rates of infection. A very good and safe choice to stay in Huatulco and avoid the problems that befell New York and many other large metropolitan areas.
"HelloMexico still has a long long way to go, as like many countries. Still no signs of strategic corralling and stamping out the virus. We all want this to just disappear, but a fight is essential.

Agree suze
"A few other words need to be ""swapped"" as well. There is not general agreement that the 2020/21 leisure travel season has been abandoned. I, for one, do not agree with this. Second, few things in life are guaranteed and we are unlikely to hit a 100% safely requirement for COVID-19. That hasn't happened for most other viral diseases (with few exceptions such as Yellow Fever). Third, airlines and governments in places like Mexico and Spain are already trying to develop mechanisms to allow tourism to resume.Funny how some people like to present their own personal opinions as fact."
"Unfortunately, it it not funny at all!"
"KeishaT  I can think of a dozen viral diseases that either have vaccinations for or have excellent treatment that exists way beyond Yellow Fever off the top of my head, so your personal opinions might also not be facts.Otherwise I agree with your statements above.Edited: 11:48 pm, May 26, 2020 "
I'm not sure what your point is. I just used yellow fever as an example of a disease that travelers might encounter that does have an effective vaccine. There are others as you have stated.
"You said...""That hasn't happened for most other viral diseases (with few exceptions such as Yellow Fever).""My point is it has happened for many viral diseases."
"Whatever, There are lots of viral diseases without a vaccine that a traveler might experience on a trip to Mexico including Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya. And yes, of course there are vaccines for many diseases. And regarding your other point, most things that you read on the internet (and particularly sites like Trip Advisor) should be taken as an opinion, a guess, etc. unless you can verify and trust the source."
"HelloAirlines, airline charters destined to face strict paralyzing fines if the Covid-19 is brought back through international ports.

Not much new about that. Every time your passport is swiped you are in a government database. Can't see getting too excited over this.
"Well, in regards to PatY, friends just flew back on Sunday, Hux-MC—VCR and to their final destination, and non of that occurred, outside of the usual passport check."
"I doubt that the airlines will receive ""paralyzing fines"" either. It will be very difficult to prove the source of COVID-19. The Mexican and local government are already working hard to restore tourism in the Riviera Maya and Cancun."

"Covid 19 is.certainly not “out of control” here in Canada. By adhering to suggested safety protocols such as maintaining physical distancing, wearing masks where physical distancing isn’t possible, and frequent hand washing, we have effectively flattened the curve of new infections. As a result, many parts of Canada are successfully re-opening and relaxing restrictions. It is expected that there will continue to be isolated flare-ups of the virus in various parts of the country but with diligent contact tracing they should be quickly controlled."
"Well, at least one Oaxaca media has not dramatized it. This morning's El Imparcial has the same number as cited above for cases in the state, 6924. Perhaps more telling, new cases between July 6 and 7, for the state capital 83, and for Salina Cruz, Juchitán and Tehuantepec together, down the coast from Huatulco, 35 new cases in that 24 hour period. Given that of the total number of cases, 1308 are of people in the healthcare sector (i.e. doctors and nurses), does anyone really want to end up in a state hospital or clinic, be it in Huatulco, Puerto Escondido or Oaxaca de Juárez? Alvin Starkman - Mezcal Educational Excursions of Oaxaca"
"As per John's post, suggesting that COVID-19 is out of control in Canada (i.e. by grouping us with the US) is ridiculous and stupid. We are a separate country and for the most part are handling COVID-19 quite well. We have been very conservative with respect to managing the pandemic and in particular have not reopened too early. It has been a long 3.5 months with no end in sight unfortunately."
"Is anybody going to miss PatY and all her alias friends, including the “travel club” in Huatulco? Maybe we can finally get back to informative, authentic, helpful, knowledgeable and beneficial information , to Foreign travellers and Nationals to Huatulco. There are websites one can access for if needing Covid -19 information, regarding the world travel situation. Not PatY, etc, etc........where are you CasaHoffa, did you go home? Stay safe and check in when you can. PS- Canada is doing brilliantly, because we are Canadian!"
"Alvin, we are in an unprecedented time with Covid. I have always felt that you can get adequate medical care !in many areas of Mexico such as Oaxaca City, Mexico City , San Luis Potosi, Merida, etc. My concern is that a hospital in Mexico does not have the same requirements as in the USA to at least stabilize or treat a patient. I believe that a person could find themselves in Mexico without health insurance and without adequate effectivo or cash or credit card be denied medical services. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks, John"
"John C: I’m not sure what you mean that ""a person could find themselves in Mexico without health insurance"".Someone will just wake up one day and magically be in Mexico with no insurance? Nope.....doesn’t happen.If someone is stupid enough to willfully travel anywhere during a general pandemic period without adequate insurance, then they not only threaten themselves, but also others they come in contact with.Also, you are stating the obvious that medical and hospitals have different standards in separate sovereign countries. That’s no different than Canada and the US. However, the way the US has been going, if I, as a traveller, had to choose between being there or Mexico, I would choose Mexico for many reasons, *including* the medical situation."
"For optimum confining control ending transmissions of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic 1 or both both below must transpire to expedite success. 1A) VaccineOr 2A) Every country strictly abide by same set definitive rules/laws for everything from masks, distancing and travel with zero evolve or differentiate protocols.  2A) will never happen. Countries, republics, states, provinces worldwide are all over the map with respect to rules, laws, ideas, standards to end Covid-19.Factual examples are Texas and Florida, each state opened up for social and economic reasons and that has become a disaster.We will unfortunately see, for economic reasons, places re-opening and airlines reinstating, first, high profit destinations. This re opening and flights most likely be halted after a causality count.With the incubation time of covid-19 depending ones health and immune strength, cases will seep through. The 14 days has now increased in some countries.Until a vaccine is proven, all travel and especially leisure travel has changed forever.Seeing resorts and others reopened in Huatulco is great to see, but they are focused on attracting guests living within the country of Mexico, that are not expected to quarantine 14 days.International travel to Huatulco scenario.,.1. Arrive at airport(s) travel on plane(s) most of the day and many next day stop over. All passengers in close quarters wearing masks. Many worried or suspicious that someone may be infected. (We all see it everyday attending supermarkets etc)2. Arrive in Huatulco and go directly to a private residence quarantine for 14 days as you have entered from another country. Have a person deliver all provisions required for your quarantine 3. If successful with quarantine enjoy your stay in Huatulco, always being focused on the rules and respect for yourself and others.4. If you require any type of medical assistance in Huatulco, Covid-19 or other, be prepared to be at high risk of exposure to Covid -19 at the hospital. AND have a a mile of room on your credit cards or a large tap on your ATM access.5. Returning home... Arrive at airport(s) travel on plane(s) most of the day and many next day stop over. All passengers in close quarters wearing masks. Many worried or suspicious that someone may be infected. (We all see it everyday attending supermarkets etc) REPEAT 14 DAY QUARANTINE.6. If ones does not follow the above, you have failed yourself and 2 countries and have assisted in the spread of Covid-19. See above 2A.7. Ultimately, if you wish to spend 1 WEEK to vacation in Huatulco, the amount of time needed is 5 WEEKS.Edited: 2:22 pm, July 11, 2020 "
What's the best place in Huatulco for tacos?
Keisha....where would we be without humour?!Salud!!
Humour is usually better than frustration!
Love a taco talk! So many great places!
"For folks thinking about returning to Canada, please see this information:https:/…coronavirus-covid19.htmlCH"
Transat announced today that they are cancelling all winter flights South out of Western Canada.https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/transat-canc…
I suspect they will be back flying many of these routes again in the 2021/22 Winter. For Canadians the most probable vaccine availability date appears to be the summer of 2021. That along with lifting the 14 day isolation requirement for Canadians returning from out of the country should make travel in the 21/22 Winter possible again.
"Prior to being inoculated with a proven vaccine, we do not understand why anyone would consider vacationing in Huatulco and spending 14 days in quarantine, the need for wearing masks and social distancing after the quarantine, and the possibilities of being infected on the air flights or while eating in restaurants, and spreading the virus to local folks....not to mention another 14 days in quarantine when you return home.CHEdited: 5:59 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"CasaHoffa, and Alvin Starkman thank you for your unwavering integrity and truth. International vacation travel is not even on the radar or in the thoughts of governments or airlines.A big warm DE NADA! To all the people that have thanked me. I can not even fathom going out of my way to push, hint, induce, sway or cajole anyone to visit Huatulco. Examining the horrible pandemic, the enormous amount of earthquakes, one must have a ulterior motive to coax or temp others to plan a trip to Huatulco. Bayside Real Estate/Own Mexico design effort to beg for business is appalling and dreadful. Greed over human safety is 100% wrong and always unacceptable. (See for yourself arrogant and horrible). It has never been a worse time for foreign investment, especially vacation travel destinations.There is only one primary factor that will solve vacation travel, and revert to normality and we all know what that is,Immunization Vaccine.Call me all the names you wish."
"I can't resist...if I can call you all the names you wish, how about Alex and Pat as well? I think you would respond to those. Bayside is encouraging people to come to Huatulco and downlaying the risks which I have to admit is disappointing. However, your childish attacks on Bayside are also disappointing. International travel is very much in the minds of many US airlines as they continue to take lots of American tourists to Cancun, the Riviera Maya and other places in Mexico. I am really hoping that they don't add flights to Huatulco from COVID-19 hotspots in the US. I also hope that the US soon puts in place a 14-day quarantine for returning international travellers like most other progressive countries have done. However, I am not holding my breath to see that happen."
"Marcus, it is our understanding that the USA (CDC) already has a 14 day quarantine for international travelers. For more infomation, see:https:/…after-travel-precautions.htmlCHEdited: 9:00 pm, July 31, 2020 "
I saw the low virus numbers in Huatulco and I suspect public schools here in Texas and my main employer could be shut down by September or October. Since I have about 5 months of personal and sick leave I would consider a Huatulco trip. 14 days of quarantine would even prohibit a solo bike trip to La Entergra?
"Marcus, there is a sparsity of testing in Huatulco (as with all of Mexico). Consequently, a reasonable multiple is suggested by local experts somewhere between 20-50. For example, recent statistics suggest that pulmonary complaints and appointments are 50 times greater in the past year, so as much as 50 may be a reasonable multiple.Again, we do not understand why anyone would consider vacationing in Huatulco and spending 14 days in quarantine, the need for wearing masks and social distancing after the quarantine, and the possibilities of being infected on the air flights or while eating in restaurants, and spreading the virus to local folks....not to mention another 14 days in quarantine when you return home.CHEdited: 9:54 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"CH - unlike Canada, the 14-day quarantine is merely a suggestion for the US. It is not mandatory in any state that I am aware of (perhaps 1 or 2)? Thus it is pretty much meaningless.I think your second email was in response to John's but I agree 100% with what you have said. Reporting the number of cases in Huatulco means nothing when there is very little testing going on. There should not be any tourists going to Huatulco at the present time in my opinon. If I lived there I would be really, really concerned with the influx of tourists from elsewhere in Mexico."
"Marcus, we don’t know what you mean by “suggestion”. Most folks we know are required to quarantine for 14 days when returning to the USA from international travel, as well as from many states. Of course, some folks who don’t care about infecting others seem to misconstrue information to fit their own ideas.CHEdited: 10:28 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"The decision to have a 14-day quarantine is determined at the state level and thus the CDC guidelines on their own are not enforceable and are a suggestion more than anything. Some states require the quarantine, others do not. Even if a quarantine is in place, a lack of enforcement will be a problem. This is one of the reasons that COVID-19 is out of control in many states with things getting worse in general. Policies, enforcement, contact tracing, etc. is all done at the state level. As an example of this, COVID-19 is out of control in Texas but many Texans continue to like to travel to Mexico. As per the Texas Health and Human Services website (https:/…travel) the Texas regulations regarding the 14-day quarantine state: ""the CDC advises that anyone who has traveled internationally in the past 14 days stay home for 14 days and monitor their health"". This is meaningless and such lax policies are contributing to current problems in Texas (and elsewhere in places like Mexico which have few restrictions on people coming from Texas).Edited: 12:35 am, August 01, 2020 "
"Actually, Marcus, as far as we know, the Mexican border is closed to nonessential folks coming by land. Further, we don’t know how you define “meaningless” as most folks we know who do not quarantine when required are subject to legal consequences.CHEdited: 9:01 am, August 01, 2020 "
"Check the Facebook site called ""On the Road in Mexico' re: travelling from the US to Mexico by car. Hardly a closed border. By ""meaningless"" I mean that the CDC advisory regarding a quarantine on its own means nothing. Take a look again at the example that I provided for Texas. All enforcement is done at the state level and this will range a manditory 14-day quarantine to a suggestion/recommendation that you quarantine as per the CDC advisory."
"Marcus, FYI, the entire state of Oaxaca is now classified as “ red” with regard to COVID restrictions.There is a sparsity of testing in Huatulco (as with all of Mexico). Consequently, a reasonable multiple is suggested by experts somewhere between 20-50. For example, recent statistics suggest that pulmonary complaints and appointments are 50 times greater during the past year, so as much as 50 may be a reasonable multiple.That said, we do not understand why anyone would consider vacationing in Huatulco and spending 14 days in quarantine, the need for wearing masks and social distancing after the quarantine, and the possibilities of being infected on the air flights or while eating in restaurants, and spreading the virus to local folks....not to mention another 14 days in quarantine when you return home.Staying healthy is difficult enough at home as opposed to the additional stresses and anxieties of trying to stay healthy at hotels and unknown apartment rentals.BTW, FB is not our primary source for factual news.CHEdited: 3:09 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"I wasn't suggesting FB as a source for factual news. That site demonstrates the number of people crossing into Mexico from the US on land. I agree 100% that this is not the time to be travelling to Huatulco or anything where else in Mexico. Unfortunately, it is far too easy for people to be doing so."

"HelloReviewing several of the recent posted messages, somewhat interesting.Many southern vacation destinations commence their high season In October.Ask yourself, do you seriously think that vacation leisure charters, airports, take off and return, will somehow magically be instantly prepared, instantly staged or have a proven solution for safe travel to Huatulco? Or to Mexico in general? Covid-19 is no where near the “infancy” of control in Mexico. (Yes many nations are the same).Casa Hoffa offers valuable facts, guidance and instruction, very appreciated. Leisure travel may be seen as a reckless foolish endeavor. If you travel for leisure into Huatulco you are not doing anyone any good, including yourself. It appears there are only 2 solutions to harness this pandemic.-stay home apply the safe guards, wear a mask, keep your distance wash your hands.-Proven Vaccine.The crass, pathetic and insulting attempts one “MAY” see on social media, to dupe and trick people to travel to Huatulco, exemplifies, only exploitation and profiteering.
