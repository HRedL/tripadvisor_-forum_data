"Hello all,I am wondering if anyone has any information regarding Covid-19 test results not being received in time. My wife and I are traveling for our honeymoon this Sunday, July 19. We got our test done on Monday, July 13th and were supposed to receive the results in 2-5 days. Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience as us, we are getting quite nervous as the time to depart for Antigua is quickly approaching. Thanks in advance for any help!"
"I know you're in my birth town of Akron, but I heard that in Florida, its taking 14-18 days for results! It all depends on area that you live! Nothing is consistent ANYWHERE! Hope you receive yours SOON!"
This is the exact reason why many if not most people are not booking a trip to Antigua as there is no guarantee that test results will come in within a week. Right now it takes almost 2 weeks for the results to come in due to increase in testing.
"We are set to leave Sunday July 19th and still waiting for results, I called JetBlue they told me they will let us board the plane but if we do not have them by time we arrive in Antigua they will test us there."
"@Gol - Just keep in mind that according to this website:https:/…You will have to pay $100 USD for a test on arrival and quarantine for 48 to 96 hours until Antigua officials receive the results of your test. And @Andy, please let us all know what you experience at the airport in the United States (allowed boarding or denied boarding without test results in hand) and once you arrive in Antigua."
"We just pushed our trip to Monday, that will be the latest that we can fulfill the 7 day requirement for the covid test. If we do not receive the results still we will have to push back to a later date. I did see that, but not willing to risk being quarantined for 48-96 hours. Frustrating being in the hands of the testing labs/government. But what else can we do?! God forbid I test positive and i've been spreading it to people for a week awaiting results."
"My fiancé and I are in a similar situation, took the test Thursday for a flight out this coming Thursday. No idea if we can get our results in time. Have you received your results? We’re concerned modifying our trip last minute could be problematic"
"So u are saying people without tests results who may be positive will be on a plane for 5 to 8 hours depending on where they are flying from and then tested at their destination?No thank youWe are in a pandemic Now isn’t the time to travelEdited: 1:42 pm, July 19, 2020 "
"Unfortunately, we still haven't received them. Waiting until around 6pm tonight before we have to reschedule again. We're working with a travel agent and staying at Sandals so luckily she has been able to transfer everything so far. I called the testing lab, the state, all with no luck. I hope you get your results in time! I was told 2-5 day wait time, but the lab must be backed up where I'm from in Ohio. Best of luck to you!"
"@Canadasunny53 - That may not be the case. Take a look at esale's post over on the ""what are the protocols for arriving in Antigua from the US?"" thread. Travelers without test results in hand are being denied boarding by American Airlines."
Thanks weathermanThat sounds much safer for travellers who have their negative results
@Canadasunny53 - I agree. I just wish the other Caribbean nations would follow Antigua and Barbuda's lead. Having to have test results in hand 48 hours to 72 hours before you get on your flight is difficult for travelers like myself.
"I arrived in Antigua on Sunday with my Covid test results in hand. We flew through Miami on AA and no one checked our Covid results or asked any questions in Miami. Others posted about the process in Antigua and they are very efficient. At our resort all guests are wearing masks as they walk around. At dinner, beach or pool you take your mask off. I would say 100% of the people are following the rules very closely. I highly recommend Antigua during this difficult time...but have negative test results in hand."
We were going to book for Antigua but have been hesitant for this exact reason. There is zero guarantee you will get the results 7 days prior to leaving. That is really stressful!
"@Lori S - Imagine the level of stress if you're trying to visit Aruba, especially if you're from any of the 24 states that they've listed on their webpage:https:/…traveler-health-requirementsA negative COVID test within 72 hours AND upload the results AND no testing on arrival for folks from those 24 states? No thank you.Edited: 10:38 am, July 21, 2020 "
"No results yet, today is really the last day we’re willing to wait for them With our flight being first thing Thursday morning. Thinking about switching to Jamaica later tonight."
"@kinasmithI am curious as to how you make out, as I am in a similar boat - from CT and have a flight to Antigua 8/1. When I called testing in the area they said 2-3 days for results, which I am hoping is accurate.."
"@RBJ Not sure where you are in CT but we had ours done at DOCS Urgent care which went from 3-5 days for results to 8-10. These are using big labs like Quest (CVS uses Labcorp). Some small labs like Yale are able to do their own results in 2-4 but these are typically reserved for surgery patients. We have a friend who we are traveling with who got their primary to call them one in for travel (mine is only doing this for symptomatic patients). They also aren’t leaving until Sunday, not sure what their outcome will be. My mom also got one for work in New Hampshire and it’s day 8 with no results.Jamaica’s requirements are limited to specific states and since we’re staying at Sandals we can just move our trip to one of those properties."
"@kinasmith I am in central CT, I saw DOCs as one of the options - good to know the 3-5 days isn’t accurate. It’s seems you are right about the big labs being delayed, I have been trying to find a place that is not outsourcing to the big labs. Unfortunately we are not doing the hotel route, so we are a bit limited on our options."
"I am curious if anyone has attempted to use a test that was taken more than 7 days prior to entry to Antigua but the results came back within 7 days? For example, if I am tested this Friday (24th) and the results take a full week to come back (31st) , and I fly out next Saturday (Aug 1st) , will my results be accepted? I'm just wondering how closely they're looking at the results. Like, if the paperwork states July 31st and my flight is on August 1st I'm curious if they'll actually look to see what date the lab test occurred. Seems pretty impossible to time this thing right and I'm trying to avoid having to reschedule a 2nd time."
"@brooklynrunnerIt sounds like we may be on the same flight, if you are flying Delta on 8/1 from JFK. I was considering getting tested on the 24th as well, as the extra day may be needed."
"@BrooklynRunner - Great question, especially when you consider what Christopher Pugh had to say over on the ""what are the protocols for arriving in Antigua from the US?"" thread. I would think that if your COVID paperwork doesn't have a date the test was administered but only has a date for when the results were obtained AND the fact that the test was negative for COVID, you'd be okay to enter Antigua. Since the tourist Dollar is so important to Antigua, I wouldn't be surprised if some Antigua officials were more lax than others with the COVID entry procedures. On a personal note, I called my doctor's office today and found that COVID test results are taking 5 to 7 days to be returned to the patient, with a lab in Houston doing the testing once the tests are received from the office. Results are only available Monday through Friday, and that's a little too close for comfort for me for Antigua. Looks like it might be Mexico for me or another country that doesn't require testing before arrival."
Does anyone know if they accept the Rapid COVID-19 molecular test results?
"They do not. It has to be PCR. But man, how much easier it would be if they did accept the Rapid test!"
