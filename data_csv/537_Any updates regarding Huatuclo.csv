Great answer. We are also booked for November and I have been following COVID-19 very carefully (and also have a lot of knowledge from my job). At this point I have no clue if we will be able to travel in November or not. More time is needed to see how things evolve with COVID-19 (in Huatulco and Mexico in particular) over the next 2-3 months.
Great answers. Also booked for November. Will follow all the updates. Thank you
"There was a meeting today including the Huatulco Administrative Council and representatives of the restaurants to discuss when and the safest way to reopen. FYI, the current President of the Council is a physician. The President released a statement on Facebook indicating that next week more information will be forthcoming.CH"
"I do know that Westjet is offering some pretty juicy prices right now,.. added plus is if booked before June 30th they have a one time cancellation due to COVID not subject to hefty fees etc,"
"We are older and prime candidates for the COVID grim reaper. No plans to travel without a vaccine, and that seems very unlikely before January. If an accurate immunity test becomes available, then I might reconsider. While our Premier in Alberta was promising immunity testing a while back, it seems to have now been put on the back burner. This of course is not specific to Huatulco, except that I suspect the local hospitals probably have no ventilator capability. And the equipment they do have should be used on locals that may need it, not on us tourists.Edited: 11:55 pm, June 12, 2020 "
"Ron, so you won't travel without a vaccine?? I hope they develop one, but you do recognize that healthcare experts have yet to develop anything for the Norovirus, which has been plaguing the cruise line industry for at least the last five (5) years; probably significantly longer. Just asking, not trying to pick an argument. ¡Diviertanse!"
"I too hope that a safe, proven vaccine will one day be available, but until then I will add Covid 19 to my list of risks that need to be carefully managed. There are a host of other, just as dangerous viruses that exist without vaccines, as well as the risks involved with air travel or automobiles. We all have to be slightly more observant and take different types of precautions when we travel as a result of Covid 19 and I am willing to do so. My wife and I (both in our 60’s) were fortunate to have survived our bout with this disease in April without hospitalization or lasting effects. While there is talk that having the virus once will impart a degree of immunity, no one knows for sure and we are certainly not going to assume so. If Mexico will take us in February we are going."

"The interesting thing about this virus is that it seems many can have it and the case is so mild that they don't know they have it. As one doctor explained it the virus is able to penetrate the body cell to the point of replicating itself with destroying the body cell. This apparently is why they don't show symptoms. However they can still spread the virus to others. Some estimate that up to 40% of the cases are of this type. It also probably explains why we got so much of the virus into both of our countries, as temperature and symptom checks are useless in detecting this type of the disease. These people tend to be the younger people, and as a result feel the disease is way over rated.However for those that are older than 70 and have underlying conditions like diabetes, blood pressure, excess weight, etc.. The risks of adverse outcomes are much much higher. I would estimate based on data that I have seen that risk of death for my personal situation is probably about 1 in 6 if I contract the disease. And that would be with the very best health care. In other words no better than playing Russian Roulette. This all said, I am extremely confident there will be a vaccine. This virus is not mutating very much. I think at worst it will be a once a year vaccine like the flu, not a one time vaccine. The trials have so far shown generation of immunity antibodies. What is not know and will only be known with time is how long the immunity will last. There is a remote chance we have had COVID already, and if so, we would have gotten it in Huatulco in January, probably from resort guests from Spain. We sure had all the symptoms except the fever for myself, although my wife said she had fever. But until there is a good immunity test we will never know. I certainly would pay for one, if they became available in Alberta. We can get tested on request for COVID, but that is kind of useless unless you are sick. In any case we are taking a wait and see approach and are certainly not planning or booking any vacations. I am not even prepared to fly domestically. Seems to me that if one is going to travel it would be good to think about an emergency return home option if the worst happens. I believe there are options for a medivac plan that flies you home, instead of providing medical coverage in the country you are in. The issue would be whether or not they would exempt COVID from the coverage."
"Unfortunately, no vaccines have been developed for SARS or MERS, not even the common cold which is also a human corona virus. We are not aware of any vaccines for any of the corona viruses. (Anyone know for sure?) A viable treatment may be our best bet. In any case, at our advanced ages, we are resigned to face masks, social distancing and small group gatherings outside in the fresh, hot, sunny, breezy (and currently humid) air of Huatulco.Anyone who thinks they have had the virus owes it to themselves, their loved ones and neighbors to get tested!Stay Safe, Be Well....and Wash Your Hands!!CHEdited: 12:08 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"A good,reliable antibody test would be very valuable for many ,many reasons, the current one is like flipping a coin apparently"
"Actually, the antibody test is reliable and provides info about the infection. However, no one knows if having the antibodies provides someone with immunity nor for how long a person may have immunity. Though, getting the test does provide information about one’s physical state.CHEdited: 12:16 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"PM away. We booked our flight and condo in February (before COVID-19 was a ""thing""). I haven't checked my insurance but will soon. Would I book now for this November/December? Only if I was very clear what my insurance covered (or not)."
"Here is the announcement from the Huatulco Council for the reopening:https:/…gaceta_5ee8501f5e9c1927d268f51f.pdfIt is in Spanish and 10 pages in length, and spells at the reopening dates (15-18 JUN 2020) for those business that can reopen, including the beaches and beach restaurants, and the ""sanitary"" regulations that will be enforced (for example 30-50% capacities). Also, it includes the many businesses that may not yet reopen, for example bars, spas....Stay safe. Be well.CH"
"If the link in our previous post is not functioning, please use this one:https:/…We have posted Huatulco's reopening plan on the TA website for permanent access.Stay safe. Be well.CH"
"I am so tempted to jump on the deals, however I think November will likely be an extremely risky time to travel with high infection rates. I also got quite ill for the entire month of January with a respiratory illness and lingering symptoms through February. I got my antibody test through a local lab, and it was negative. No chances of me saving the realm :("
"We don't know what the infection rates will look like in November or whether improved screening or treatments will be available by that time. As mentioned, I would only do a booking for any time this year (and early next) if I was sure that everything was refundable and if I was covered by insurance if I decided to go. Even insurance won't help if the health care that you require isn't available.We will potentially know a lot more over the next couple of months. Or not."
What about July 1st? Do you know any current updates we are traveling fromCalifornia with kids to our usual spotAnd have tickets to leave July 1st
"If you come here, you would need to be in quarantine for at least 2 weeks.CH"
