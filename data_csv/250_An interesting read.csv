A very interesting article to explain how Greece dealt with the Covid-19 threat. https:/…
"It's amazing how a rather small country that was ridiculed by many other countries about it's economic policies, socialist thinking and corrupt government is now being praised on how it has handled the virus.Since I don't live in Greece and don't know everything about how things are it appears the new leader of the country is a no-nonsense guy that has taken the virus seriously and acted quickly and decisively resulting in low infection and death rates.Greece has much better leadership, integrity, discipline and compassion than what we have for leadership in the USA resulting in my country leading the world in infection and death rates and is becoming more embarrassing each day."
"Thanks for that Nicksy.Another interesting read is this, highlighting the effects of Covid 19 on tourism in Greece despite handling the situation so well.https:/…"
"The difference with the economics, compared to 2011, is that all countries in Europe are now in the same economic mess. And because of that the European Commission seems much more willing to help."
"Thank you Nicksy...I knew Greece had done well with Covid 19 and that is a great summary Also, as mentioned, a blueprint that other countries should have followed in general. Now will be the even tougher times...as has already been seen opening up too fast and without very strict guidelines or allowing tourism too soon can effectively wipe all of this out. Many of us will be watching to see how Summer and Fall go in 2020 and sure hope to return next summer."
