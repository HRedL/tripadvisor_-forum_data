"Japanese Government have just approved Remdesivir of Gilead Sciences for the first drug for Covid-19 disease. The decision was made since its emergent use was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 disease in the U.S.A. on May 1. These decisions were based on the results of its 1st RCT for severe Covid-19 disease in the U.S.A. and Japan, but the RCT also showed serious side effects, such as multiple organ failure, renal failure, and liver dysfunction in @20% of patients taking the drug. Thus, it seems that its use is now optimal only for severe Covid-19 disease. Further RCT for patients with mild and moderate Covid-19 disease are going on in the U.S.A. and Japan. Anyway, this is a great news for people considering future travel to Japan. They probably have to find a travel insurance now which covers Remdesivir for Covid-19 disease, so that they can receive the treatment when infected with the virus in Japan. Avigan (Favipiravir) of Fuji Film will also be approaved in May in Japan, and will be used for mild Covid-19 disease at first, since it is an oral medicine without any serious side effects except for fetus and is relatively inexpensiuve, unlike Remdesivir, which is a intravenously administered relatively expensive medicine."
"So far, it seems that Remdesivir will be free of charge in Japan.https:/â€¦There was an article on the COVID-19 medical bills.https://blogos.com/article/455684/I thought I read somewhere that all of it will be covered by taxes but it doesn't seem so."
"Yes, Global715255, it's true that Remdesivir is still free, and the stock of Gilead Sciences is and will still be low, unless they show its efficacy by the on-going RCT for mild and moderate Covid-19 disease, although I bought their stocks a month ago. If they cannot show its efficacy for mild and moderate Covid-19 disease soon, despite its side effects, Gilead Sciences cannot have any profit by the drug and I should sell those stocks and buy the stocks of Fuji Film again. Then, we also don't know when the drug becomes unavailable."
"OMG, investment matters more for you, Dr. Abei. It sounds like that Avigan is more effective and with less serious side effects for the mild and moderate patients. Well, the best thing is to avoid personal contact as much as we can, which is impossible for doctors.Stay safe!!"
"BTW, did you also buy the stocks of Shimazu Seisakusho?"
"No, why do you think the stocks of Shimazu Seisakusho is good? Is that because of their PCR machine? I remember one of my friend suggested me to buy their stocks in March.Anyway, I agree with you that it seems that Avigan is more important for mild and moderate patients. I haven't bought any stocks until this time when I bought the stocks of Fuji Film and Gilead Sciences. The reason why I was interested in these drugs in March was because I thought they would become important for travelers coming to Japan. Then, I thought I should do something for myself, and thus I bought the stocks of Fuji Film. But, I learned that the RCT of GileadI's Remdesivir would be earlier, so I sold the stocks of Fuji Film and bought the stocks of Gilead. As a clinical hepatologist, I knew that Gilead Sciences is the best company for anti-viral medicine in the world because we could successfully treat many patients with viral hepatitis C and B by their great medicines. In addition, gene therapy for cancers using many different viral vectors was my main research project for more than 20 years in our University, so I knew basic virology and thought that Avigan (Favipiravir) was the most promising drug for the Covid-19 visus."
