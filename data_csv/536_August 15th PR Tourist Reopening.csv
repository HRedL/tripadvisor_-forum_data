"PR was supposed to reopen for tourists today (August 15th). The link to the travel advisory has been dropped from the main page at Discover Puerto Rico, though you can still find it if you do a search. It has not been updated. No one I know there seems to have heard anything. Does anyone know the current status?"
"The governor announced yesterday (14 August) that her executive order regarding COVID restrictions (curfew, closures, etc) from 31 July will be extended, as is, for an additional week -- until 21 August.Changes to restrictions (to go into effect on 22 August) will be announced on 19 August."
Thanks. That's right there is a primary this week.
"is there going to be a major difference in one week? I interpret this to mean the governor will keep extending the restrictions. Sounds like a safe plan.Edited: 3:30 am, August 16, 2020 "

Everyone is required to wear face masks or face coverings when in public, and are subject to a fine, if not. Changes and updates to this Executive Order will be announced on August 21st."
"Im seeing people are beginning to grow tired of the apparent missteps by the government in pr and its back and forth policy. I see people outside at the beach all day long same as before the july 16 reclosures. I believe things will not get better by closing be beaches or gyms anyway, quite frankly the numbers are up so slightly it isnt anything alarming to me when compared to other states like Florida. The high risk should quarantine but other people that would like to visit the beach and gyms will hopefully do so safely and soon.Edited: 5:37 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"True, we have fewer cases than Flordia (using your example).But we were doing REALLY WELL with ""flattening the curve"" until mid-July when we re-opened ... then all hell broke loose.It's not enough to have fewer cases than Florida. We need to have fewer cases than we had back in March/April (which we have surpassed with flying colors)."
Has the update announcement been made yet?

Will swimming pools be open?
"Except for residential/private pools, all shared swimming pools are closed.Edited: 11:58 am, August 20, 2020 "
"The simple answer to almost any question on any of these forums is that things change daily, covid19 is in 213 countries, it's no time to travel for fun. People living on the Caribbean islands don't need visitors bringing the virus to the islands, many of which don't have the facilities to deal with a major outbreak. It's impossible to understand why people can't simply cancel and go when everyone can be safer and have an enjoyable time. Stay safe!"
"You do know the virus is already on the island. It's everywhere. Traveling for fun is a no no. Yet traveling for work is okay because the virus only attacks people trying to live life and enjoy it. Don't think so. Maybe instead of telling people what you want them to here, you should just answer their questions on what they asked. Our Vrbo host is overjoyed that we did not cancel our trip. He has been in contact with us, and has even given us a list of places that will gladly take our business and welcome us."
"Of course your vrbo host is overjoyed. Which business owner you know is happy to lose money? But did that host tell you that the restrictions have just been made stricter?We’re here to answer questions. And yes, we are happy to encourage visitors to enjoy the island. But this is just not the time to visit visit PR. For many reasons: COVID-19 and a very fragile infrastructure, business restrictions, non operating tours, very fragile infrastructure; closed beaches, restricted alcohol sales, very fragile infrastructure.... Did I mention fragile infrastructure? Sorry if this is not what you want to hear.Edited: 8:06 pm, August 21, 2020 "
"Yes, we are aware of the restrictions. They will not cause any issues with our trip. We don't party at bars. We keep to ourselves. We stay close to were we like to snorkel, and only take our snorkel gear and bottle water. We have our own pool were we stay, fully equipped house with everything we need. We will make one shopping trip and stock up on needed items. Will follow all restrictions. Eat at places with outside seating, if and when we go out. The airlines are still flying. The hotels are still booking. Stores and businesses need customers. Starving people to stop a virus is not the answer. Stress causes issues and lowers the immune system. I couldn't imagine the amount of stress not knowing how to pay bill's or feed my family because everyone is more afraid of the virus."

"Good luck snorkeling then. If you're lucky, you might even leave the beach without being fined."
"Dana is just one of the many people who have been sucked into the disinformation vortex in this country. That, or just a bad faith partisan, or maybe just a troll. Either way, it's probably best to ignore those types. They seem to feed off of the conflict presented in these threads. These people are the sole reason that we can't get the virus under control. They refuse to accept reality, and verifiable medical fact. We are living in the dumbest time of my life, by far. I hate it so much. To all of you who are being responsible human beings; thank you!"
"""These people are the sole reason that we can't get the virus under control. They refuse to accept reality, and verifiable medical fact. To all of you who are being responsible human beings; thank you!""Exactly. Very well said."
"Dana: You have every right to your opinion. But...... if you travel to PR you are imposing onto us your opinion. So.... please, please, please, anybody with that opinion, vacation at you home state or take your business elsewhere, preferably a place where they have your same opinion.. Do not come to our island to vacation. Don't worry, we will not starve. Thank you."
"ii cancelled my trip to P.R. in march and was hoping to come back in the summer, now I'm hoping around christmas time but I doubt it. Anyways, I always see this TIMMMAAY guy crying about covid19 and spreading fear. It's guys like him who are ruining the world and not allowing people to go back to normal live (with some extra safety precautions)."
