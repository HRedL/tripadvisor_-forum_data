"The mask's use will be mandatory.Four strategies: one referring to Flores, Corvo and Santa Maria, with no cases registered since the beginning of the pandemic; another to São Miguel, the island with the highest number of infected people and the only one with a record of deaths (13), with chains of infection identified but with restricted transmissions; another for Graciosa, 12 days without new cases; and one last for Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Terceira, almost all of them for 28 days without new infections (Pico will reach this number on Tuesday). For the covid 19-free islands - normal resumption of health services; resumption of maritime passenger transport between the islands of Flores and Corvo; the opening of several establishments, namely bars or gyms, and the opening of bathing areas, always complying with the rules of social distance; Thursday opening of various services of the regional administration; maintenance of the teleworking regime in all cases where this is possible; Thursday opening of nurseries, kindergartens and adult day care for seniors; on the 11th, there will be a ""resumption of face-to-face classes"", with a mask and disinfectant to be used by ""the whole community""."
Thanks for the update. Wishing everyone a safe gradual opening.We have flights booked end of June so your updates are very helpful!
"Thanks. Hope that you'll be able to come, but probably not... the news are that the region's strategy is going to be something like this “First, in an even more protected phase, the plan points to the regional market; followed by the national market; and, only later, and depending on what is possible and recommended, open to international markets.”S. Miguel is the one with more restrictions:May 4 - circulation on public roads will no longer be prohibited, but will only be limited to essential situations - on this island, for example, animal walks or physical exercise outside are not allowed.From the 22nd of May, the opening of commercial establishments, industrial infrastructure and some services will be authorized.May 25th - the services of the regional administration will be opened, but maintaining the teleworking regime “in all cases where possible”, especially for professionals who are included in risk groups. The face-to-face classes will be resumed in São Miguel, but only for students and in subjects with a national exam. On that day they will open gardens, museums, libraries, nature reserves and bathing areas.May 29 - Restaurants and bars, however, following the “restrictions on seating capacity rules and all others that will be determined by the Health Authority”"
"Thanks a lot for this useful information. Our trip to Pico, Corvo and Flores is scheduled to begin on the 9th of July. I wonder, if it will be possible to make it...Could you please provide also link to source of your information (even if it's in Portuguese)?"
Azores has a site for Covid19 evolution https://covid19.azores.gov.pt/ and you have the news on the national and local newspapers.
"Great, thank you very much :)"
Hoping everything is ok! We have been trying to stay informed. We have a trip booked in the beginning of November to Sao Miguel.. hoping we will still be able to come without issue. We really enjoyed other islands and have been looking forward to this vacation.
