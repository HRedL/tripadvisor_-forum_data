"I spoke to someone from Jet 2 today on the phone to see where I stand if I cancel my Benidorm holiday which is for Sept 11th. My options were to amend my holiday date with no admin fee but I would still have to pay any difference in price or cancel my holiday and lose 70% of the holiday cost as it's now less than 70 days to departure. I don't want to cancel and lose 70% so I'm hoping either they cancel if things get worse and I'll get a full refund or if things get better they take Spain off the quarantine list. Even if it was quiet, I'd rather go if it's safe than lose 70% of my holiday money."
"I'm going on the same date and I feel as safe in Spain as I do in the UK, but I suppose it depends on your lifestyle."
It is very uncertain times.I just can't understand why anyone is booking holidays abroad this year with cancellations and Covid etc.Steve
"Hello tebo,Many no doubt will have booked long before covid 19 worries, some will no doubt want those holidays still even though its maybe going to be different, equally many will be relieved to get a refund, peoples outlook and circumstances will be different.Atb steve"
"It's alright for you tebo, you are there.I'm coming in a while, because I want to be there as well.Covid is everywhere, I feel safer in Spain."
Just sit tight and do not cancel it will work out in the end no problem. Benidorm will be safe and if they call it off you get your money back. No reports of Brits being ill in Spain. The 14 day rule is what you have to worry about.
"Sorry mally, benisteve and everyone else, didn't mean to sound glib.....Hope everyone who has booked for Benidorm this year has a great time without any hassle from airlines and booking companies. SteveEdited: 1:04 pm, August 10, 2020 "
"Hello tebo, i don't think you will have upset anyone ☺.Atb steve"
I have already had one cancelled by the holiday company. Got two more which were booked well in advance. Think I would agree with Simon. Just wait and see what happens. Not worth getting too worried about as even boffins cannot out think or predict the coronavirus.
Nothing wrong with a good altercation :)
"Everything is moving so quickly just wait it out as people have suggested. I would feel more confident in Spain as they police their rules. I had to visit a local shopping centre yesterday, in the west mids and I would say a good third of the people in there did Not have masks on. There is certainly no social distancing happening. The UK, come Sept may be in a worse place with the virus than Spain. But I digress another important factor to consider if you travel to Spain. If the UK govt still have Spain on the FCO advice list for nothing but essential travel then if you travel your travel insurance is void. Specialists also seem to no longer be offering cover either. Jet two thus far have been responsible though and have not being travelling against FCO advice. Let’s hope the numbers are back under control by Sept and you can travel & enjoy yourself."
"^^^^^ Good sensible post that.In the past I would have hung back, but now I can go with how I feel personally.I only have myself to worry about."
If you holiday in Spain will your insurance be null and void?
"#13, most travel insurance will not cover trips to countries the FCO advises against visiting.Spain at the moment is advised against.You can get some medical care on an NHIC card, but possibly only until the end of December.There is also a possibility, maybe only in my head, that the companies who are flying you over at the moment could stop, for whatever reason, leaving you high and dry in Spain."
"Battleface no longer covering for Covid 19 if bought after the 2nd of April.Edited: 6:00 am, August 11, 2020 "
"Yet members on the Tenerife forum are saying they are purchasing. Cut off age is 59. This was posted on the 8th August, Tenerife, who is still traveling. See below. >>>On a separate note re. Insurance - you can get specialist insurance for travelling against FCO advice - we bought through a company called Battleface. There is even COVID cover included - for medical and repatriation, not for cancellation due to COVID <<<"
I've read their statement 3 times Jenny and they won't include Covid in their policy if taken after the 2nd of April for any reason. This wasn't second hand info but from themselves.
"https://www.battleface.com/travel-medicalSeems to say they cover some Covid, in some circumstances. Also seems to say they cover up to age 80.I won't be testing it for a while."
"This is taken off the Battleface Webb site ""Does battleface cover for COVID-19?Yes, our benefits include cover for medical expenses caused by or resulting from COVID-19. Claims will be paid for medical expenses up to the amount shown in your schedule of benefits and subject to the terms and conditions of your policy. The COVID-19 cover is available with this product for policies purchased from July 17th, 2020 for travellers up to and including age 59 or under. We do not include cover in relation to COVID-19 expenses for trip cancellations, curtailment of a holiday or lockdowns"""
"They have a few different policies , it seems. Lot of chat about it on various threads Tenerife. However, the Canarian government is making arrangements with AXA insurance for some holidaymakers. Also others saying Saga will now offer cover. Not read anything, just read another poster saying.Just typed Battleface into Google and this came up first on their site.>>July 17th, 2020battleface is now pleased to offer travel insurance which includes cover for medical expenses caused by or resulting from COVID-19. Claims will be paid for medical expenses up to the amount shown in your schedule of benefits and subject to the terms and conditions of your policy.

Tui are offering some Corona add on insurance if you book with them. Hope I don't heed it.https:/…covid-cover-terms-and-conditions
"Have not read this either but posting it because it may be of use to some who haven't already bought their insurance.See link to this is money. https:/…Edited: 7:17 am, August 11, 2020 "
"Could we perhaps see a senario where after the traditional spanish holiday month is over, along with British schools going back the government may change its stance on travel. I certainly hope so."
"Think that may be in the hands of whether or not Spain can bring their ""R"" rate right down. At the moment it seems to be going in completely the wrong direction.Think we have learned that if we allow countries with high ""R"" covid19 rate to enter the UK, it will very likely increase our ""R"" rate and then will be out of control here again. Last thing we need here is another lockdown. Enough people here are already suffering for all different reasons because of this pandemic. So many people waiting for different life changing operations and treatments. All of those waiting for treatment on the nhs also need to be considered.Holidays are a luxury, health is more important."
