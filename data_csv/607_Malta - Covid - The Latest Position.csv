"Due to an evident increase in Covid cases over the last few days, it is considered that all Covid related matters be condensed into one active thread. Hope visitors to the site find this approach helpful.Edited: 1:54 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"This comprehensive article from the local paper gives a good summary of the live position, as at 29Jul20.https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/covid…"
"It’s just a fact of life that this virus will pop up when restrictions are relaxed. It’s not going anywhere and it’s something we’ll have to learn to live with, whether there’s a vaccine that works or not. If people want to hide away for the rest of their days then that’s up to them but I certainly won’t"
"Looking forward to visiting Malta next week. However, I will be respecting social distancing etc and do hope the government ban these mass gatherings as it seems ludicrous they are still permitted. Why haven’t they learned their lesson after the Radisson incident??"
We will try and keep you informed each day and would also like feedback from t/a people who are visiting the island and also ones who live there.
"9 further 'local' cases today, plus 19 immigrants at the Hal-Far compound. (Total = 140). A few days ago, it was just 3 in total.Planning travel is sadly increasingly difficult. Our friends in Ireland booked last week for a September trip but like us all they are concerned about the European trend.Edited: 7:20 am, July 30, 2020 "
From the 04th July 2020 Malta is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.Until the UK government’s advice change’s then we shall be travelling to Malta on Sunday as planned. Philipa
"We've also booked for September, though had we known about all the music festivals now planned, we may have had second thoughts. Still, all our accommodation is booked as fully refundable until mid August and we can change our flights for free so we will keep an eye on things. Really hoping we can make it but time will tell."
"We have our flight in 10 days. 2 weeks ago when o booked our flight there were no new cases in Malta, 4 active alltogether. Now something has changed however in 10 days it can be better but even much worse. That's the problem,nobody knows! So, thank you for updating infos!"
FCO have changed their advice and warned against mingling with dirty people at hotel parties and village fiestas! https:/…coronavirus
"A friend just returned back from Spain and told me that - because of the spread of the virus - they always had to wear the mask, actually everywhere, also outside in the streets, in the hotel bar...etc. Policemen are shouting at you to take it on all the time. He found the whole holiday quite unpleasant. I would like to avoid a holiday like that. I have chosen a country where I can feel safe and at the same time with a responsible behaviour we can make a happy holiday. Without anyone would shouting at me and reminding me of the virus the all the time. Exactly as we did in Sardegna at the end of June. I don't want to isolate myself but for me it is normal to be informed and to be careful accordingly."

Pls close the airport..we need to stop tourists
"iv just cancelled my holiday,dont want to take the risk mixing with dirty locals!"
“ Pls close the airport..we need to stop tourists”And take away 27% of Malta's GDP - great move - see other thread on here.Elsewhere Guy you say you want to leave Malta - how are you going to do that if the ports and airport are closed? Swim?
"One of the things that might help matters is if people wore masks properly.Arrived this morning. I was really unpleasantly surprised at the stupidity of many of the passengers. If you are going to wear a mask - wear it. Having it below your nose is like wearing only the left side of a crash helmet.......How dumb are people? Easyjet staff tried and then gave up.Wore ours from car to car.Wore gloves in the supermarket and have sanitized ourselves and any surface within reach.I have to say - much like the UK, there’s a large proportion of locals not really distancing or taking precautions - and a fair few who seem not to understand the concept of a face mask and why it needs to cover both airways.As far as ‘closing the airport’ - it was barely open. Very quiet. I think if you look at the majority of the posts from that individual, it suggests maybe some deeper underlying issues."
"Interesting to note that airport passengers were also not adhering to such rules. I recall reading an article that passengers felt safe at the airport. In general many are not adhering to social distancing or mask wearing. But there's only so much you can enforce. However with the rise in cases many locals are once again weary and so we should hopefully start seeing masks being worn properly and maybe more attention in general.Edited: 3:39 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"Lots of local tensions this evening so hopefully places will sharpen up on mask enforcement. EU have advised Malta that the migrants must be included in national numbers and declared correctly; so stats as from tomorrow will start at 140 cases.Doctors are planning a strike from Monday in response to tonight's attempt by the health authorities to manage mass gatherings going forward. You may ask what has this got to do with my holiday? I still repeat that Malta is tiny, think of all of this happening in one UK city. It's real shame after a commendable track record in low virus numbers. The Prime Minister here, Abela, continues to bleat ""business as usual"". See if you can work that one out."
According to the Google virus tracker there was 94 new cases for 30th July
"9 locals and 85 migrants, who were previously being counted separately as they were isolated upon arrival to Malta. I recall XD posted an article relating to these cases. Official figures can be found on Facebook - look for ""saħħa"" which is the official health page.Edited: 1:06 am, July 31, 2020 "
"the irish government are considering removing malta from their green list,they have basically said its too dangerous to travel to a small island overun with covid infested illegal immigrants!source independent.ieEdited: 1:28 am, July 31, 2020 "
"Thanks Ole,Seems Ireland's Green Travel List will be reviewed on 4th August 2020:https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/cov…The greatest difficulty is the risk of booking due to the uncertainty of position over the next few days / weeks. Last minute prices for most are prohibitive. Staycations seem the wisest strategy this Summer."
"‘Staycations’ at the Radisson are, essentially, what kicked this all off again!Parties, events and gatherings need to be completely stopped.It needs to be a boring, quiet meal and a pint for a while to stop this spreading."
"staycation means stay in your own country and stop ruining my retirement!Edited: 3:17 am, July 31, 2020 "
"Just found this article, it seems mass events are over for a while also in Malta:https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/fearn…"
"Szofi, that's not the case. Mass Events can take place and will do so based on the parameters lined out in the article. That is why the Doctors are planning to strike from Monday as in effect mass events will still occur, based on numbers / size of venue.Malta has had very few restrictions on anything since early July, way ahead of other European countries.It's a case of watch this space."
"Our green list is less than useless if you look at the countries that are on it. I can go to Gibraltar oops they do not have an airport as theirs is in Spain and that is not on the list.I can go to iceland now I am not that stupid, Italy now how this got on any list is beyond me, Estonia Latvia Lithuania half of their population are living in Ireland.The only country on the list is Malta as that is about the size of Dublin and has less cases than we have in a week of Sundays.If you are unemployed or laid off your job the Irish Government is trying to stop your payments and the Green List they did produce half of them have more cases than Ireland."
"There are rules / laws for holding events like this, where there has to be a certain number of paramedics present and ready to assist.All it will take to scupper these events is for Maltese paramedics to say they're not providing medical facilities. Whether there's the possibility for organisers to recruit 'private paramedics' at ridiculous pay rates to ensure it goes ahead, I don't know. But, if not, it just takes action on my first point for these to be a non-starter."
"10 new cases today (31 st),we are doomed!there was 158 in Luxembourg to give some context.Edited: 6:50 am, July 31, 2020 "
"10 new cases today, correct. And bringing to total to 150 ongoing cases.On the face of it, not a lot. But when there were only 6 - SIX - outstanding cases a matter of just over a week ago, that increase is massive.Remember, in virus terms, the number 7 in Malta equates to 1000 in a country like Italy."
"@Wrappido - Half of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are in Ireland.No they aren't, catch yourself on making comments like that. Irish people emigrated around the world for years so can hardly criticise others for doing the same to try and better their lives.Edited: 10:50 am, July 31, 2020 "
"Wrappido Gibraltar do have an airport it's the main road that runs by the beach, they put barriers down each time a plane lands or take off its terrifying especially take off as people are stood near the fence and you can see there almost blown away, it's amazing one of them hasnt being blown away or worse into a jet engine.My cousin was based there for quite a few years we use to go visit him,I'm too much of a chicken now too even think about going on a plane that'll land there. Lol.Edited: 7:42 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Guy Malta you come on travel forum for Malta which is mainly tourists asking questions about Malta to say close the airport bla bla bla what reaction do you expect, you do realise that tourism is Maltas main income, what else does it have to offer, its not like you export a lot is it, gozo salt maybe."
"Goak long swim for him to sicily or north Africa, hope he's a strong swimmer. Lol"
My money’s on the sharks Eileen But if he doesn’t like being out when tourists are about he should stay home with a box of kleenex....
"gOak I can see his point to a certain extent as tourists do mean more risk at the Momrnt, but this guy was making similar posts before covid about anti tourism occasionally, He obviously really dosent understand that without it Maltas economy would shrink by over half."
"Jonathan,I am not complaining about them actually they are lovely people who are very hard working a bit like the way the Irish were before the Celtic Tiger and all that rubbish.I have at least 9 invitation to go to Latvia and the others by ex staff who worked for me and am looking forward to going there some day.Eileen where have you been hiding locked up in Burnley ."
"""gOak I can see his point to a certain extent as tourists do mean more risk at the Momrnt, but this guy was making similar posts before covid about anti tourism occasionally""Indeed Eileen - any movement of people or human activity present more risk - however I'm not convinced that tourism to Malta from the UK, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands etc. is the problem. The first and subsequent people to be tested positive in Malta were apparently residents, including an Italian family living in Malta, who had returned from Italy and elsewhere in the EU, including two coming home from the UK.The data is shown on Wikipedia and elsewhere on the internet;https:/…COVID-19_pandemic_in_MaltaThis vindicates the decision of the Maltese Government to control entry and impose quarantine requirements previously. In this new 'phase' the issue seems to be more around mass gatherings, including parties, and clearly shows the need for the recommended protocols.Many Maltese and expats depend on tourism for their income - to pay rent, bills and put food on the table. The money then goes into the wider Maltese economy. They have been really struggling. It seems inappropriate therefore to stop tourism at this time as it would be disproportionate.Some of the comments here on TA are trolling, nothing more.Edited: 6:19 am, August 02, 2020 "
"After reading all posts on this thread, I can see that most of them deviated from what the OP intended (to keep a Corona placeholder / status update). So pardon me to go back to that.I was looking for a 'safe' destination to spend 6-7d (since all of my other plans were cancelled).I can find cheap flights towards mid-AUG, and since from what I ve read Malta is a promising destination, I m seriously considering it. I m a conscious traveller, adhering to social distancing and wearing masks *indoors* for contributing to overall safety (despite wearing cheap masks offer no protection to myself whatsoever - FFP2/FFP3 class masks are nowhere to be found here!)On a previous post I ve read that measures in Malta are relatively 'loose' - does that mean that most/all sites are open? Will I be able to visit most iconic places (based on current government info!)? Or am I likely to miss important landmarks due to closure?Will I be able to *not* wear a mask outdoors (since that makes no difference anyway) and not been shouted by the police or threatened by locals? These are the things that are the minimum requirements in order to be able to 'enjoy' holidays, I m sure most will agree. As I mentioned earlier, I am a conscious person, with basic common sense and have no intention to jeopardise mine or anyone's health.Due to the covid situation, my intention is to rent a small car, even though under normal circumstances I would opt for public transport, especially for such a small geographic area.If I m to receive some positive input on my concerns, I d prefer it to come from a local or someone who lives there at the moment, with real/actual knowledge of the situation. No pun intended!I understand that situation can chance from one day to the other (e.g. surge in number of cases), but I m asking this info bases on *now*"
"With population density what it is, most beaches are too full to truly social distance. Mask wearing where it is needed is also very sporadic. If those facts are going to cause you anxiety might be best to stay away?With 185 cases today, levels are higher than when Malta was under lockdown. That is a concern as the number of sporadic cases is inevitably on the rise."
"""Will I be able to *not* wear a mask outdoors and not been shouted by the police or threatened by locals?"" many people were barely bothering with wearing it indoors let alone outdoors (although this may change as many locals are once again weary). no one will shout or threaten you so that will definitely not be an issue! we were never required to wear it outdoors to begin with.Edited: 1:10 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"Thank you both,185 cases in a single day is record-high given the total population. But I guess it's inevitable in a way, as tourists are flooding in. Same here in Greece. It was all under control with single-digit numbers (of daily cases) till recently. That was until the International flights resumed. People are not bothered taking measures when they should.Btw, I m not likely to go for swim if I get there. I rarely do (even here). And I certainly wouldn't be even attracted to it if it's crowded as you say. That's even before the Corona crisis - now, I d probably go nowhere near such places.I ll prob decide within next few days.Edited: 2:48 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"Solocation - it's only 15 new cases today, taking it to a total of 185 active cases - not 185 new unless Times of Malta has its into completely wrong. I'm heading to Malta on the 10th, so long as the UK Government doesn't take it off the exemptions list in the next week, and having been reading the info for a week, I have mild concerns but get the impression they have far better track and trace type facilities than over here, and are trying to contain the new cases. From what I've seen in the last week around 80 or more of those cases are relating to boats of immigrants which were quarantined immediately - and many of the others relating to a specific big mass gathering and some others to feast celebrations. - They are announcing new restrictions on mass gatherings, the music festivals have been cancelled and so have the feast celebrations. I'm getting my info from https://timesofmalta.com/ - which I'm reading more frequently than any UK news based site at the moment to try to get fairly accurate info."
"Gilbster is right, that figure is the total reported covid figure which is high due to the migrants which were immediately quarantined (over 85 cases). However such figures have now been included in Malta's totals after previously being excluded, so you may note that there seems to be an incredible ""spike"" which is mainly due to the change in reporting. Sahha on Facebook is the government's official page where daily figures are presented. Action has been taken to limit mass events and indeed many events have been cancelled. (more info here: https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/fearne-to-hold-press-conference-amid-calls-for-limits-on-mass-events.808473)Regarding swimming, i think it depends on where and when you go. We visited 2 popular Gozo beaches this weekend (in the morning) and everyone was spaced out and it was definitely not crowded. But it seemed to be an overall quiet weekend in Gozo and the same will most probably not be the case for mid-August. 15th August is a public holiday and many workers are on shutdown for 1-2 weeks, so beaches will probably get more crowded than usual (especially as many locals may be opting for staycations). Additionally some Maltese beaches are very popular so it is expected that many flock to them, especially during the weekend."
The emerging issue is it's now 10 days here to get a Covid Test and this means individuals are likely to remain in circulation for at least a couple of weeks prior to securing an appointment.Doctors have deferred any strike action until Wednesday and are demanding a Government response should new cases remain in double figures over the next couple of days.It's certainly a challenging period in Malta's journey with the disease to date.
"drama over,new cases down by 1,although XD will be along shortly with some bad news:)"
"The objective of this thread is not to create a running commentary aimed at myselfSadly 14 new active cases today, increasing the overall number to 199. Have some understanding please that it's getting a real challenge to book a flight anywhere in Europe presently. I have no issue with tourists aiming to travel but I consider it re-miss of them to travel 'blind'. We recently saw travellers complaining in Spain that Governments acted quickly, impacting on their much needed (but non-essential) travel plans. Today Lithuania & Estonia have joined Latvia in enhancing restrictions around Malta. Things have moved so quickly. Please move over this thread if you are tired of the subject matter, which I was hoping would be based on factual numbers rather than sarcastic banter. Yes, the increase is of course bad news, for all."
Your unbiased updates are appreciated XD.Thank you.
XD I value your views greatly.I am in the same position as Solocation with the exception I already booked flights and villaI figure if travel from UK is still allowed at the end of August we can enjoy the villa and site see historic sitesBeaches less an issue although clearly if we see the chance for a safe picnic one day it would be greatIf the position worsens I will take the hot and just not come - clearly if travel between UK/Malta is banned again the decision is made anyway
"Dear wigwam,I don't envy your position. Best you can do is keep an eye on things and take it from there. With your own villa you can 'control' your exposure to crowded places.Latest news reports here keep talking about clusters (the Hotel Party cluster, the nightlife zone Paceville cluster, the migrants cluster). The main issue with Malta is its size. Clusters at one level may be irrelevant as locals travel the island over both for work, leisure and indeed beach visits. Tourist attractions in themselves should be quieter due to the lower number of visitors. The issue to me is the lack of discipline in social distancing and mask wearing where needed. Our Prime Minister is constantly mocked for his post lock-down speech, ""Business as usual"". It's far from that currently. Each traveller must make their own decision based on the latest facts and their own risk assessment.Edited: 9:24 am, August 03, 2020 "
XD - keep up the balanced reporting. Good idea to have a single thread based on fact.
"Update for 4th August 2020, 16 new cases.https:/…16-new-covid-19-cases-reported.809439I urge visitors to avoids group gatherings."
"i hope guymalta hasn't been banned,hes funny!"
"Not surprised !! Arrived here on Sunday, Mellieha beach absolutely packed no social distancing in place and represented the photo’s in the tabloids of Brighton UK beach.We checked into our hotel LABRANDA Riviera Hotel only to check out the same day due to the huge mass gathering of local residents. We thought we were in IBIZA at some club beach/pool party as to the amount of people in the water !!Checked into a bayview room at near by Paradise Bay Hotel only to find exactly the same mass gatherings and over crowded pool by locals !! No social distancing or temp checks in place either.Meal times are just a joke you need to get there early as you will be lucky to even find an ‘Olive’ left let alone anything else.Today totally packed again I witnessed a grown guy blowing his nose in the pool WTH totally disgusting.I get the hotels are struggling due to the lack of tourists and filling the hotels daily with locals but they need to employ more staff to cope with the local demand.Have raised our concern about health and safety with the hotels customer relations awaiting their response. In the mean time we are just distancing ourselves Where we can.Hope this helps any one visiting this area soon ?"
"When I've mentioned this I've been labelled doom and gloom but the reality of what your seeing is Malta's new normal. Large hotels are seeking local custom and hotel based weddings of 500 guests are still taking place, even with the new guidance.It's a consideration when booking, a smaller hotel may suit best."
so we can agree its locals spreading the virus and not the influx of tourist!
"We barely have any information to decipher who is spreading it to begin with, plus no testing at the airport so we have no insight as to whether any tourists are infected. It has been reported that an infected tourist visited numerous Paceville establishments (as is expected when one is in Paceville afterall), and cases from a Paceville cluster have been reported daily, but as far as I know there is no insight as to who was patient zero.https:/….XymHkCgzZPYI think we can all agree that the sensible thing to do would be to test all incoming individuals, like migrants are being tested upon arrival. If we keep on increasing in cases we'll soon be back on the prohibited travel list, and that won't do anyone any favours."
https:/…
"Today's reported figures will again be higher as they will include more positive migrants (which were quarantined upon arrival and so not technically part of the ""local"" transmission) https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/16-ne…Edited: 12:38 am, August 05, 2020 "
On the BBC todayhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53642430
same Szofi76
Ireland has removed Malta from its green list of countries that are safe to travel to
Now aint that just great we have at least 45 cases a day and yet we take Malta off our list might have something to do with it being a great earner for Ryanair.We can still go to Latvia.
"Overnight, the increase in cases was 36 (20 local & 16 'contained' migrants).The Prime Minister is meeting tomorrow with social partners as he claims the 'situation is under control'.At the start of July Malta had 3 active cases but now has 249. Something to think about if you are considering booking a flight."
This was always to be expected once testrictions started to ease. The virus is never going to go away so are people expected to lock themselves up for the rest of their days? They still haven’t found a vaccine for the flu after all these years
"if you are considering booking a flight,keep in mind you are a lot safer in malta than the uk or mainland europe!"
"Hi there, I have a flight booked to arrive on the 16th. Is there any chance that the government will impose a lockdown based on the number of daily cases? I need to book accommodation and the best rates are non refundable but I don't want to do this if there is any chance this might happen?"
without a crystal ball its impossible to predict although its highly unlikely.you may want to wait until a couple of days before you depart to shorten the odds further.you are probably aware irish travellers have to self quarantine for 14 days when they get home?
"Dear Amolon,I regret nobody here can give you the assurance you are seeking. That said, the Maltese Government have proven since early July that they are keen to keep open the economy as much as possible. There is currently a debate about mass events which the Prime Minister is aiming to manage. This small island relies heavily on its tourist footfall and hotels are running at low occupancy.I'd be surprised if we see any form of mass lockdown or indeed, closure of the airport."
Thank you. Yes I am aware but I am happy to self quarantine on return as I work from home.
"Hi amolon,Try www.getawaysmalta.comfor holiday apartments .They only ask for a small deposit upfront and the rest on arrival so at least if you have to change dates or cancel, its not big money."
"HiOur son is planning to visit Malta in about 4 weeks time. I've just seen on the TUI website that you have to have a negative test within the previous 7 days in order to be admitted to Malta:https:/…Can this be right? It's not mentioned on the FCO guidance, but it seems such a basic thing for a company to get wrong...EDIT It's at the end of the PLF sectionEdited: 6:26 pm, August 05, 2020 "
TUI are re-commencing flights and packages to Malta from Saturday 08/08/2020.We arrived Sunday with EasyJet from Manchester and the mandatory requirement for entry were face covering’s along with the passenger locator/health forms to be completed which are available at immigration if unable to print off.No thermal temp checks were taken or required.If the above is due to change then the FCO will update ?
"ignore tui,you dont need a test certificate to enter malta.as for the FCO they could change the advice at any point at any time,its all political,there were travellers in the air when they changed the spanish advice,the science that they follow doesnt make any sense and it appears they are making it up as they go along!"
Apparently we are at risk on being on UK's red list for quarantine. I truly hope that this news will force Malta into reconsidering its actions to ascertain that it doesn't lose such a popular market.
"Today's position, 20 new cases including 4 children and 8 from the 'Paceville Nightclub Cluster',267 cases in total are active as 2 cases recover.Do consider what you want to do once here as local crowds are really impacting on beach space, hotel swimming pools etc. Some hotels are cramming pool areas to capacity with local deals to supplement the reduced resident guests. This is understandable in relation to the economy but a real worry in relation to health."
Hi I'm booked to stay at Bella vista hotel in Qawra do youhave you any idea if it's among the overcrowded hotels.I'm too late to amend or cancel .thanks
"Hi there, that hotel certainly does not have the most desirable pool area (I'm not being unkind but it's true). That itself may be a blessing as it may make it less desirable to locals who will gravitate towards the Qawra Palace, Sea Crest & Sunny Coast with their seaside locations.I would imagine the hotel is only 50% occupied which seems to be an average figure across the island.Enjoy your holiday."
Thanks so much for your help I appreciate it I'm more reassured now
Decision by the U.K. government to be made on Malta and Belgium within the next 24hours which means Malta will be put on the red list and quarantine brought back
"I'm due to fly Monday, I really hope the UK government doesn't put Malta on the red list, I desperately need this holiday. I'm at the stage where if I have to quarantine on my return I'd accept that, just want to be able to get away without it being against FCO advice and invalidating travel insurance."
The fact they’re talking about it means it’s inevitable that they’ll bring back quarantine
"That's what scares me Gavin, too much to hope they will allow non essential travel but with quarantine in place, as that at least would give people an option. Where have you seen they are talking about it, I can't see anything?"
"""ignore tui,you dont need a test certificate to enter malta.""I suspected that was the case, but it doesn't show TUI in a very good light if they can't get something as basic as that correct!Edited: 11:52 am, August 06, 2020 "
"There’s various reports in the Maltese press and the U.K. government are making a decision tonight or tomorrow as part of weekly review.

It’s worth remembering too that the Maltese government are also pleading with the U.K. to take into account that half of cases were picked up in the Mediterranean and are now in refugee camps so weren’t caught on the island itself
"#86 I am really hoping that the UK government do take that into account, as the numbers aren't that awful and unless the whole world stays in lockdown until everyone is vaccinated there is always going to be an element of risk. And I'd rather spend 2 weeks on an island with 20ish cases a day than my island with what 900ish cases a day.Edited: 12:23 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Not sure how the UK government is considering our cases, but if it's in line with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia (link below), we're in trouble. I can only hope that something is done before it's too late and we keep on rising on that EU list.

The Welsh govt have just made an announcement that is supposedly agreed by all 4 UK nations and Malta remains on the Welsh safe list.
looks like malta has escaped for now!Belgium Andorra and the bahamas not so.
"All mass activities have been banned apart from weddings.Masks are compulsory on public transport, Gozo Channel, the airport and shops, or a 50eur fine applies."
"Dear MT-avid traveller;I'm not convinced the 8 hour meeting last evening concluded as you outline. It seems the Doctor's are still on strike today and the issue of mass events, including weddings etc remains unresolved.It does seem that the EUR50 fines relating to mask wearing in shops & public transport will indeed be implemented.Seems we may be advised later of an outbreak at the hospital, 19 new cases.

However it seems that the strike is still set to go on as it wasn't an outright ban. Very confusing situation at the moment.Edited: 3:46 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Agreed, VERY confusing. The most obvious statement is the rapid rise in Coronavirus cases and the Government's current stance to maintain 'business as usual' at all costs."
XD - an official figure today could be make or break - especially if the figure of 50 new cases Malta Today are indicating is right.
"Some concerning news for all , 50 cases likely to be confirmed, along with an R Factor above 2:https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/50-ne…What a worry for tourists, locals, travellers, every one!"
"Indeed 49 cases have been confirmed with an R above 2. Events can occur with restrictions depending on whether they will be inside or outside (300 people max).TOM states that ""dance floors have been shut down"" but I honestly don't know whether that refers to. TVM linked the dancefloor point to the events (and that such events cannot have a dance floor) - not sure if this includes Paceville clubs.Edited: 1:27 pm, August 07, 2020 "
Asked and answered - TOM reported that some Paceville clubs are open (although the byline of the same article reads that dance floors have been shut down...)https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/clubb…
guymalta will have coronary reading that report!
"40 new cases down 20%,half of them clustered,or do just post it when it goes up?Edited: 8:01 am, August 08, 2020 "
"I’m due to fly tonight. Is there any talk of the country locking down?Being in the U.K. the virus doesn’t overly concern me as we have been hit extremely hard with it since March, but, I don’t fancy spending all that money on my hotel only for the bars, restaurants and beaches to be closed"
"no chance whatsoever gavin,go and enjoy but stay alert and i would avoid nightclubs even though they are open with limited occupancy!"
"A full lockdown would be an economic and political disaster for Malta, so it is unlikely. However, you might find that they now try to enforce measures still in place and strengthen the rules on mass gatherings. As mentioned, definitely avoid Paceville clubs - the TOM report mentioned in an earlier post seems to indicate that not all clubs are sticking to the rules. I also wouldn't discount the possibility of Malta being removed from the quarantine free travel list in the near future as their rate per 100k population is now up there with the likes of Belgium even with the infected migrants excluded.Edited: 8:52 am, August 08, 2020 "
"I don't think the thread's point was to post daily figures but 49 cases were honestly a surprising surge for many of us. I personally don't consider today's 40 cases (half sporadic) to be that much of an improvement considering that 2 days ago we were at 20 cases (almost all cluster-related). But of course I understand that people see things differently and that some of us (especially locals) may have a different view on these things - indeed the first thing I heard as soon as I went to work on Friday was that 50 cases shall be confirmed, and it hadn't even hit any news portals yet! But I'm sure that to other people that's barely noteworthy news. The country will definitely not be locked down. It is still pretty much business as usual. The only issue is if other countries start putting us on the quarantine list."
"Not sure if I should ask this question here or elsewhere feel free to redirect if needed. Our 'maybe' holiday from 2nd Sept is Malta-Gozo-Malta, is there any talk of the Malta-Gozo ferries stopping again? I've read there seems not much chance of a lockdown, just wondering if there's any talk about the ferries. Thanks for this topic, really helpful to read through."
"If you're referring to the Gozo channel, it stopping is as unlikely as a lockdown occurring - many Maltese use it to cross to Gozo to holiday."
"The chances pf lockdown imminently are nil. What is often overlooked is the small nature of Malta, people travel everywhere here, it's like a large city. There are zero restrictions in place other than limits on mass events and a limited mask policy.This article shows the reality of how the virus is not limiting itself to 'Maltese clusters':https:/…"
"This thread is super useful so i’d like to say thanks for that. I’m due to visit Malta for a week on the 15th Aug. I just want a genuine opinion, should I still come and will it be safe to?"
"it depends what you mean by safe,you really have to do your own risk assesment.everytime you leave the house there is risk involved.at the moment the uk government say its ok to travel to malta and there are no restrictions in place either side,this could change at anytime.if you are a healthy 30 year old i wouldnt hesitate to travel.if you are a obese 70 year old with type 2 diabetes,i wouldnt even leave my house. you have to decide yourself,thats my opinion!iam travelling on the 18th,the only thing that will prevent this is if malta goes back into lockdown!Edited: 1:54 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Nowhere is safe - if deciding to travel here, you need to assess the risks yourselves. Please don't rely on simply the information in this thread.The most notable issue is the daily increase which is naturally concerning."
Excellent information on the correct wearing of masks on TOM today.Really wishing all those going on holiday well. Follow the rules not what others do to flout them.Stick to commonsense.
iNews are reporting that Malta along with the Netherlands and Iceland are being closely watched by the UK Govt. as infection rates are now well in excess the rate Spain was at when quarantine rules were imposed. I'd be surprised if the Maltese Govt. can talk their way out of it a second time.
"Seems to be an issue with the virus exploiting youth gatherings:https:/…https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/the-w…Personally I suggest travellers avoid the night club and bar scene in Paceville, often dominated with young persons."
if the numbers arent down by thursday malta is going on uk naughty list according to sources!today is a start i suppose!
"Truthfully figures are unlikely to go down enough to keep us on the good list given the business as usual mantra. I've been told that this weekend Paceville, Sliema and Bugibba were packed. Photos of Comino and Paceville being completely packed were circulating. This weekend is Santa Marija, so one can expect even bigger crowds. My hope of the authorities pulling their socks up to keep off the quarantine list is unfortunately not as strong as it once was.Edited: 12:01 pm, August 10, 2020 "
We’re supposed to be coming from the UK on Friday afternoon ☹️ Was praying that we might squeeze through!
"Jess, sorry to put a downer on your excitement but 20 of today's cases were sporadic. Malta is really struggling to identify the source of numerous isolated outbreaks. I sadly predict it will be days before the UK FCO updates its travel advice removing Malta from its safe list (although I see you are from Ireland and need to quarantine on return anyway). It's very hard advice but should you travel do so with open eyes. The lack of social distancing here is bordering on alarming and as in most of Europe, the youngest are leading the infection list.It's going to be a challenging week.Edited: 12:24 pm, August 10, 2020 "
Looks like Malta will be added to UK quarantine list Thursday according to papers.And Air Malta appears to have cancelled our return flight. Not that it has notified us...

"The total reached 440 active cases today as Malta sees an all time high; what a sad situation.Hard to comprehend that on 17th July, there were just three active cases. The rise in sporadic cases is of greatest concern.This trend is making any form of travel planning nigh on impossible as it's likely Malta may be classified as 'un-safe' shortly."
"The Superintendent of Public Health stated that if numbers don't decrease, it is possible that more measures will be reintroduced."
"Mt such a shame Malta is not doing so well, but then neither is the UK we have flare ups with cases rising in certain areas, I'm in East Lancashire who are under special measures, most aren't listening here neither.I go to work, come home go nowhere else, except once a week do a weekly shop, wearing a mask of course and trying to keep my distance from all the idiots who won't social distance which is 90% of the people in there.It's the opening of bars, restaurants, shops etc I think it's made people act as if it's allover even tho it's far from over."
"malta is now on the dutch naughty list and maltese visiting puglia have to quarantine for 14 days,basically stopping visitors to southern italy!"
I'd ask anyone planning to travel to check with their country prior to their trip as it seems that we have been added to several quarantine lists but some exemptions may apply.
"After much deliberation we have decided not to travel to Malta, which unfortunately means we have had to ask for a refund/voucher on the hotel, although they would be under no obligation to do so. This has been a difficult decision to make, but have done so - considering the increasing cases of sporadic infection on a small island, the impending threat of quarantine and an apparent lack of social distancing in public settings,"
"We are often accused of being the doom & gloomers on here. This thread exists in my view to relay current, factual information. Today Malta has hit the highest numbers of active cases since the pandemic began, 486 with a continuing increase in clusters spread across the island.The Government are resolute that things are under control. That is the biggest worry, believe me.The Tourism Minister is weak and opened too much, too soon.Edited: 7:21 am, August 12, 2020 "
"According to many, UK are expected to announce quarantine on Malta soon. In such a case I don't know what would apply for refunds. I'd wait it out until then to take action."
"in general you wont get a refund for being on the uk governments quarantine list,you might get a refund if you have booked a abta covered package holiday and the FCO advise against non essential travel.and the the only way you will get a refund out of ryanair and easyjet is if they cancel your flights and the only way that will happen is if malta goes into lockdown and they close the airport!the airlines are still flying to spain,belgium etc!still early days though!"
"We have booked Malta for October but already the flight booked is not showing at all for the whole of October for our airport , the balance of our apartment was due this week, the payment time for the apartment balance has been extended but I think it unlikely we will be going if the flight is no longer operating. We have not been notified by the airline though.We were also due to go to Italy in September I noticed that the flight was not operating but it took 5 weeks before we were notified I applied for a refund yet I still keep getting e-mails about my upcoming trip! Now when I log in it is showing completely different details to what I had booked, yet I rejected the alternative and asked for a refund. I assume if they are only flying at a different time from a different airport we would be entitled to a refund and not expected to automatically change and that it is a glitch in the system that it is showing as if we accepted the change. I do not really fancy sitting on the phone for hours to the airline but that might have to be the case."
Over the coming days the Health Authorities will make it obligatory that passengers arriving from certain countries or cities considered to be high-risk Covid areas will have to present certificates that in the last 48 hours before arrival they tested Covid negative.Those who do not present a certificate will have to undergo a swab test and if they refuse they will have to be quarantined.https:/…
"A completely meaningless procedure! Having a negative test 48hrs before arrival will not guarantee that an incoming passenger is not positive on arrival and will not develop symptoms during their stay. This can be no more than a distraction to try and cover up the failures related to mass gatherings and the enforcement of the regulations in force. How do they expect cruise passengers, which are due to start calling in Malta from next month to get a test - the health authorities already have a backlog of testing so it will be interesting to see how they expect to cope with a full cruise ship with a couple of thousand passengers. as well as any testing at the airport. Might all be a it academic as more and more countries take Malta of their safe lists and tourists just decide to stay away."

I'm still going Malta on Monday this is just crazy 300 test positive at a factory in Northampton nothing from government saying self isolate for 14 days if we travel there
"Dear Condeb:Britain introduces quarantine rules on travellers returning from Malta. Warning against all but essential travel:The FCO now advise against all but essential travel to Malta based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. If you're returning to the UK from Malta, you may need to self-isolate on your return. What part of that do you not understand? Is a holiday here really essential travel?"
"Hi XaghraDreamReally appreciate you keeping us up to date with COVID-19 travel information.As post #143 states they will be travelling to Malta on Monday - this obv isn’t essential travel.I booked to come to Malta on 23rd August a couple of weeks ago when the infections rate was very low. Again this is not essential travel, was meant to be a quick getaway. However with U.K. now imposing quarantine, I guess travellers that have booked are in a dilemma. Unless the airline cancel there will be no refunds of air ticket. I paid a fair amount probably as it is classed as peak period. I don’t really want to lose my money so thinking might as well just come! I guess if we’re being ‘safe’ and ‘alert’ all we can do is hope for the best? Or do I have the wrong attitude? I’m not sure. Anyways, I hope everyone on the island is keeping as safe & well as possible. R x"
"Whether to continue with a holiday to Malta is such a difficult dilemma. Each individual needs to make there own decision. None of us like losing money of course.Personally I do struggle with this concept of 'being safe', safe travel corridors etc.Malta is one of the most highly densely populated places in the world. Over 500,000 on such a small island, around I recall 3900 persons per square mile. Each must assess their own risk."
"Travellers have to understand that people in another country may not be behaving as how people in their own country are behaving. I don't know if people in the UK are adhering to social distancing etc, but a lot of tourist destinations were still busy here - as I had posted earlier on, there are now pictures to show it:https:/…Comino and Paceville are touristic hotspots so it had to come from each individual to try to act diligently. One would have to carefully plan their holiday to avoid such instances, such as avoid places which are known to be crowded. Perhaps they shall be less busy as we continue to be added to country's quarantine list, but I guess time will tell..Edited: 2:08 am, August 14, 2020 "
"i will be travelling against FCO advice,i need an eye test!the only way i wont be travelling is if ryanair cancel my flight or the maltese government say iam not welcome!"
Everyone still intending to travel from the UK should be aware that their holiday insurance will probably be invalid due to the UK FCO announcement. There may be a few exceptions if you bought your policy prior to march 2020 but everyone should check with their insurance provider before taking a risk to travel uninsured.
"you can still use your EHIC card until december 31st,it doesnt include repatriation services."
Once the money is paid the decision does become an issue but if someone has only booked in recent times they were surely aware that this situation was likely to arise.
Air Malta are offering an extra return flight today for those wishing to return to UK before tomorrow. https:/…
Easyjet Holidays have announced that they are cancelling all package holidays to Malta. Good news as far as refunds for those involved - even if the have a wait to get the cash. No announcement as to whether or not they will still operate flights.
"Due to travel on September 14th from UK, so a month away. Do you think there is any chance quarantine will be lifted by then?"
"Things change daily so as things stand it's a long way until September. For our sake I'm hoping the numbers will start dwindling down soon leading us to be considered safe again. If not, additional measures may be taken to bring the numbers down.On the other hand Malta is still to release the ""high risk"" countries which will require a negative test upon arrival.Again, it's hard to tell from now what September will hold."
Doctors have ceased their 'strike action' for one week aimed at giving the Government the opportunity to bring in measures to attack the continuing trend of infections. I expect we will see additional restrictions but something tells me we will never return to the pattern of lockdown earlier in the year.
"no cancellations by ryanair and easyjet to/from the uk so far,although the prices have come right down on ryanair!guymalta was seen on the lash in paceville celebrating the uk announcement!"
Easyjet has cancelled packages until end Augusthttps://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/easyj…
"It's a truly worrying situation here now, record number of cases overnight, 72.I seriously think visitors should weigh up very carefully their need for a holiday in the current climate.Malta seems to have committed a grave error in opening up everything far too early, there are calls for the Tourism Minister to resign. I'm not convinced if she goes it will make any difference! That said, her conduct has been questionable, especially that ill-considered BBC interview claiming Malta had managed the virus in an exemplary manner."
New meaures will be announced tomorrow to limit the rate of infections
It has also been stated that mandatory testing will be introduced at Malta’s airport.
Supposed to be getting married in Malta and due to fly out on 24th September. What is in place in Malta at the moment?
"Best focus on the new measures to be issued today. I'm sure you appreciate things here have changed fast and the local culture of business as usual is having a very real impact on infection numbers.I'm hoping some strict measures are introduced, most importantly underpinned with enforcement all aimed addressing the 'spike'.Meanwhile our Prime Minister is on holiday in Sicily!"
New measures which may impact on your trip. Clearly more detail is needed but this will take a while to arrive:https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/fearn…
"Haha prime minister for 5 minutes and already taking holiday leave, just like all the celebs in countries where we have all been advised unless essential travel !!! Let’s hope they are all staying in quarantine on arrival back ??"
"dont forget boris,s dad travelling against FCO advice,nigel farage posting from his local pub whilst in quarantine,not to mention good old dominics eye test.malta have until 9am tomorrow to put the uk on the red list or ill be on the way!!!"
"As per ToM The countries in the new 'amber list' will be announced shortly, and comes into force on Friday. The list will be reviewed every week. Malta will also maintain a 'red list' of countries from which travel is banned, and a green list from which travel is not restricted. The main restrictions that have come into force are the closure of bars and clubs and the use of masks in all closed public spaces."

Stath face masks are fine if worn properly. So many don't wear them or take care of them correctly.Worn under the chin or neck or with noses showing are useless. Paper masks have to be disposed of responsibly every four hours. It is no good stuffing them in pockets or bags to be brought out when needed.100 percent cotton masks should be washed every day. There looks an interesting development with graphene masks which give a high degree of protection.If everyone stuck to the rules with regard to hygiene and distancing things might be different.As it is I see no hope with so many people ignoring what is going on in the world and acting as though nothing is going on. If everyone cared and respected their fellow humans life would be different.
"Can't speak for other countries but cases have increased here because it's business as usual - dining out, going to the office, and everything in between. We couldn't even find a table to watch the game on a Saturday night. In march everyone was wary and staying in when possible. Now many are reasonably fed up, especially in this Mediterranean heat. Mask wearing and especially social distancing truly wasn't that enforced (as many have pointed out here)"
From Wednesday nightlife will be locked down on the island. Bars and discos are to shut unless it’s part of a restaurant and masks to be worn in enclosed places

Plus they should be removed by the side loops and not touched on the front.Cobblers? If you say so Stath. Lol. I
The Baron Bar in Bugibba is doing a €1 a drink blow out on Tuesday before the lockdown
Wonder if that's still on as the bar got a lot of backlash since the health minister had just said to not try to find loopholes in the recently announced restrictions. The bar has since closed their Facebook page!
"Hi all,I'll be traveling to Malta on August 29th. I noticed a Birgu fest was listed in the events calendar for August 30th. Are these small fests still being held and what should I expect if I plan to visit?Many thanks!"
"I'm pretty sure all feasts are off - I currently would not recommend pursuing any group gatherings . There were well over 30 coronavirus transmissions linked to a recent feast in Santa Venera.Social Distancing is a real issue in Malta, with an evident lack of discipline and you may be better to plan other 'safer' activities for your trip."
"So can someone please explain to me quite why any post that challenges, and that's all they are, offering an alternative point of view, the current international propaganda that is the scamdemic, deleted?I won't be silenced.So i will offer the argument again.For months now, certain countries have been very draconian in their rules regarding the wearing of face masks.Fines and all sorts. Threats , bully boy tactics you name it.These very same countries namely Spain, France, Malta and certain parts of Italy are locking down again and also find themselves on international quarantine rules.So can someone explain to me, what is the point in wearing face masks if, quite clearly the wearing of them makes absolutely no difference to the spread of the bug?#awaits posting deletion as it dares to challenge the current brain washing antics of those in power#Edited: 2:55 am, August 18, 2020 "
"We just came back from Malta and I have to say that social distancing is absolutly not exisisting there. More and more people are wearing masks but if in the properly way... I am not sure. I have seen so many times how grey coloured were the originally white masks because these were used who knows for how a long time! And please don't forget: Malta has allowed actually all kind of nations to arrive to the country, apart from the spread of the virus in their original coumtry. Yes there is a so called green list but do you know what does it mean in reality? You have to fill in the declaration form that you spent 14 days in one of the greem list countries listed on it. Then the stewatdess in the plane, just before the arrival collected it. Nobody checked what you have written on it. You can write what you want, won""t be controlled. Well, tourists will arrive without any controll, part of them already have the virus. They are spending a week in Malta then go home and 2 days later they say they have the symtomps and were infected in Malta. Really? As I know in most of the cases symtomps of tbe virus appear within 10-14 days. So much more probably they already had the virus when they arrived to Malta...."
Szofi this has been a concern of many locals. Then people say they got the virus from malta! As if they can say where they got it from given they had travelled and met numerous people along the way
"Welcome to the ""new normal"".Until a vaccine is found, and i sincerely think that it will be a political game as Russia recently announced they had a workable vaccine (indeed Vladimir Putin tried it on his own daughter) but that has since fallen off the radar, there have been others. But until they allow a vaccine to be used (don't hold your breath i dare say we will be the last to know) or indeed THE RIGHT COUNTRY PRODUCES THE VACCINE then this is how it is...Unless you are saying that all international travel is banned? And that is totally at odds with peoples freedom of movement. There will be people that will be diagnosed with the bug in other countries they travel to particularly those that have tourism as a major source of income.But fret not, 98% fully recover with no long lasting problems. (a fact that has been largely forgotten by the media....but misery sells airtime/newspapers)."
"Wearing a mask would be useful if people would wear it properly and at the same time keep distance and wash their hands regulary, using desifection regulary. But that is not the case. Many people think if they wear a mask everything is done, they are untouchable. In my country it was always told that the mask won't protect you to get the virus. Just think about that your eyes are not covered... But they say it will prevent to spread the virus if you are the person who is infected. That's why it is compalsory,you can never know if you have it or not."
"But you have cooked your own goose with that argument.If for most THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE BUG OR NOT......then really, can it be that bad?I mean the old adage of those that proclaim to have flu when they have in fact a cold.Someone says there ""there is £100 in the garden in used £20 notes it's yours"".If you have a cold you will go and collect.Real flu? You won't be able to go and collect.So my argument and it is very old ground as we are 6 months in but really....for 98% of people that do contract the bug it represents a few days of feeling dodgy.That is why i rebel against draconian measures and economy wrecking tactics.There simply must be a hidden agenda."
Repeat #169
"No Taffy what you are describing is splitting hairs, or indeed it could be conceived as clutching at straws.So the lock down brigade are not happy that even with the silly mask wearing rules being by and large adhered to the numbers are still on the increase indicating to those that possess even a smidgen of common sense the wearing of masks makes no difference whatsoever.So to counteract that fact some people are saying ""but they are not wearing the mask properly"". Really? I don't think so. You are either wearing one, or you are not. Most do, when and where required, numbers are still on the increase and we have a situation Malta finds itself in.Just doesn't make any sense Taffy. Fact is wearing a mask has not made a scrap of difference as countries that enforced the wearing thereof are having problems with numbers."
We will never agree Stath but I will carry on being as hygienic as possible.There are plenty iof people who do not use soap and water after using the toilet and they would argue that washing hands doesn't make a difference.If all the guidance we are given is followed things would be different.
"Indeed.I agree with hand sanitisers particularly the gel but again that is thwart with problems.Use it too often and you will end up with dry skin. Use it and attempt to put in/take out contact lenses? All sorts of problems.Fact is we are not immortal. We will all die at one stage or another. There is a wealth of things out there that could ,and will, get us. Taking on mother nature? You will never win.....We should all just try and live our lives as if it was our last day because one day.......it will be!"
"For reader's info, 48 new cases declared today, thankfully lower than the last couple of days. In a month, Malta has increased from 5 to over 600, with the rate of cases per 100,000 being among the highest in Europe.If planning travel, please be vigilant. Later today it is claimed the Government will issue revised safe travel lists, categorised into red, amber & green. Cyprus banned travellers from Malta today which does not impact Malta arrivals, other than to indicate how others are viewing the situation here."
"Can't you just publish the death figures?I mean, they are the ones that folk are truly interested in.And they have to be entirely Covid caused deaths.

Sad to report that the Baron Bars €1 a drink night must didn’t go ahead. I went round with a tenner euro note and was disappointed to see it was closed
Was due to fly to malta on the 17th august when the announcement came last friday about quarantine we had a decision to make as to cancel everything or go well we decided to go and what a brilliant decision that was everything over here is as safe as anywhere I've been in england over the last few weeks masks in shops masks on buses social distancing obeyed everywhere yet you are still able to enjoy your break .Took a bus ride to sliema yesterday halfway there police cordon and police come on bus and check everyone is wearing a mask perfectly friendly but nice to see at the same time would this kind of thing happen in england no and yet england is suppose to be safer what a load of tosh .My advice anyone in the same boat as we was deliberating over whether to come I'd say do it you wont regret it
Can't find it on my Samsung Stath.
Unless you have downloaded one of the Covid tracking apps such as the one being developed by various governments/health authorities switching it on/off makes no difference this is the bluetooth interface between 2 phones for these apps.. All android/IOS phones can track your location and a lot more without this - just turn location on!
Thank you that explains it as I haven't downloaded it.
You should have the exposure notifications tab without an app download as it is part of a Google update - your auto update must be off and will appear next time you update manually. The Google part only works if you download a tracking app and that can only be done manually when the nhs release it (only on the Isle of Wight for now). All above board and publicly visible so nothing for the conspiracy theorists.
"That's sneaky,didn't know that was there!"
"Has everyone I know scratching their heads.Suffice to say mine will say ""off"" and remain as so.Quite where this will end I know not, but it is getting rather spooky and straying way too far into invading ones privacy (freedoms have already been robbed).Scamdemic.Edited: 10:26 am, August 20, 2020 "
How about all the cctv cameras around to follow us?All the more reason to wear a mask to foil them. Saw someone today with one on his head. Made me smile but of course totally useless.
Some things truly show what a small world we live in - saw someone wearing it on their head here too!
"CCTV is an interesting one,about 25 years ago when cameras went up in our town centre there were the usual rumblings but their appearance coincided with a marked drop in crime in the area which was,of course,very welcome!"
Like Malta has loads of policemen and women nah but they do have access to nearly every camera on the island.Skylinewebcams and all the traffic cams plus a whole load more and the ones on the drones that Malta police use all the time.When they had the presidency of the EU they got millions to update all their systems and motor vehicles never seen so many bullet proof black limos new police bikes and cars.Also when you arrive in Malta and your phone says welcome to Malta before the customs man then you know you are been tracked by Google Goverment .com
"36 new COVID cases in Malta today is the lowest number for the last few days. Hopefully we will see this ongoing trend, hopefully to be followed by an eventual easing of international travel restrictions."
I feel like many are exercising more caution than before. In fact I seldom come across anyone without a mask inside shops. And I've noted more people wearing it properly too. Hoping that this will help drive figures down.

"Not sure where you're getting your info on their effect - or lack of - from, but anything is possible as a lot of information has changed over the months given that nobody knows anything about the virus! If masks work then good for us. If they don't, then oh well, at least we tried to do something about it, plus it avoids people spitting on me when they talk which I never favoured :-)"
STATH MASKS WORK IF WORN PROPERLY. Not shouting just informing you.Most people do not wear them correctly.
Any chance of restrictions for Malta being lifted before 17th September?Is the R rate going down at the moment?
Really impossible to predict. Some measures were put in place last Monday and the Police have stepped up monitoring of the new rules this week after a pretty slack period.The last couple of days have seen lower case numbers but they are still ten-fold on 4-5 weeks ago. It will take about a month of 'control' to see much more reduced occurrences I fear.Things change quickly so let's hope Malta makes good progress in the next month.
"Poland is considering introducing restrictive measures:https:/…Locals here are saying that the Maltese Government is intentionally keeping things relaxed in Malta so as not to upset owners and big business men the tourism sector, they can then say ""we tried to keep you open but everyone else shut us off"".Edited: 1:34 am, August 22, 2020 "
"i wouldnt worry about tourists XD i was out in sliema last night and it was crazy packed with locals in all the bars,resturants and the promenade and there wasnt any social distancing.its not tourist spreading this virus around the island its the local population!"
"Was in St Julian's yesterday. We had to make a reservation for a table just for drinks. Couple before us (young tourists) were waiting for a table and were not carrying a mask on them. I'm assuming they weren't up to date on the latest news of needing a mask when you're not sitting down at the restaurant, or else they're just plain rebellious. The hostess immediately made them purchase a mask from her - now that's one smart way of handling the situation and making a profit from it!"
"It's very interesting to see differing viewpoints. On another thread a tourist praises the behaviour here and above we read about a different experience in Sliema.I personally consider that rushing to behave as normal, without effective social distancing will have implications. It's a tough one but I see far too many mixing far too closely for my personal comfort. Each to their own but it makes an individual's social network huge, which this virus exploits."
""" Each to their own but it makes an individual's social network huge, ""Must be an age thing but I can't decide whether that sounds painful or just disgusting,whatever I haven't got a clue what it means!"
"just been to starbucks in sliema,counter service,no masks,no social distancing no sanitizers!"
That's odd! I recall visiting Starbucks early on when shops were opening again and I was impressed with their behaviour - all with visors and stickers to maintain distance. Passed by last week and the same could still be said. Quite odd to hear you say that as authorities are being more strict on masks now.
"Sorry to be blunt...but those wandering about noting ""nobody wore a mask""....""no sanitizers"" ""oh those ghastly youth they were no social distancing""...I'd pay attention to where you are walking. More people have been killed on the roads since all this shenanigans began...Last thing I would want is for someone wandering around taking note of what everyone else is doing to get run over by a Maltese lass in a Fiat 500 bombing about speeding and chatting to her pals on her mobile, while eating a slice of pizza!! Now that would be terribleIn other words....do what YOU want to do, and leave everyone else to do what THEY want to do...and don't jump to conclusions...There are medical reasons some don't wear the regalia..Personally i am a paranoid schizophrenic......so as a consequence I do not wear one (funny when i say that to folk that moan at me for not complying....social distancing is never an issue also!!).To be forewarned is to be forearmed!"
Now if you would not socialize with most of these people before covid why would you want to go near them now.We all know that getting on a bus in Malta is suicide anyway so getting on a bus with all them people that might have covid is the theme tune to MASH so dont do it.As Stath says he is a paranoid schizophrenic who can spell would you hang around with him in a pub in Qwara Malta so dont do it.I am a Paddy and we are all mad so would you social distance with us nah but I would like to see Maltese lass in a fiat 500 darting in and out of the traffice in Sliema as it would be the only car moving in that place.and if you think the woman are bad dont get me started on the blokes I know who drive with their eyes closed.
"Reminds me of our first time in Malta,the driver who picked us up from the airport warned us to watch out for cars being driven on pavements,he was half right,it was a bus that nearly got me!"
"There has been an increase in positive cases overnight after a few days of declining numbers; 55 new persons declared today,. This increases the number of active cases on the islands to 680.(Proportionately 55 cases daily equate to around 8,000 new cases if applied to the UK)Please remain vigilant as it's a mixed bag here regarding social distance."
If you are arriving from Coventry where it is 20th on the UK list and rising up the ladder I think you would be much safer in Malta.Plus you can go out in the sun unlike this place rain rain rain.
"Google ""Riot squad raid a bar in Paris as innocent folk watch champions league final"".Some truly HORRIFIC scenes. All it needed was Darth Vadar making an appearance and you would have whatat best be a scene out of a 12 rated action film.At worst a scene from a George Orwell novel directed by Stanley Kubrick.Watch that, come back on here and then tell me that this plandemic and the draconian guidance thereof, is not a scam to simply control and dominate the population.Have a look, then comment."
The Czech Republic and Tunisia have been added to Malta’s amber travel restriction list.Arrivals travelling from these countries will need to produce a negative COVID-19 swab test 72 hours before arriving in Malta or else be subject to random testing upon arrival.
To put another view Stath the virus is spread by people who refuse to take notice.I was in a shop today and a notice was outside requesting people to take care and only three people in the shop at a time.It was a small shop. I obeyed the notice but did others?It was totally ripe for virus spreading.We know what to do but do we do it?
Now Usain Bolt has covid.He knew what the rules were but went ahead with his birthday party. Now feeling a bit sorry! Too late.

"If planning a trip, currently Malta stands in 2nd place in the EU for the number of infections per 100,000 of the population.46 new cases today. It seems recent measures are insufficient.The main island with over 450,000 persons is only 95 square miles, so avoidance of others is a real challenge."
Hi XD where do you get this information from please?
The source data is:https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaMy concern is travellers often seem more worried about losing the cost of a budget flight than understanding the picture in Malta is of real concern.I certainly understand the desire for a holiday but would not travel against Government advice (that said I'm a more mature person than some!)
I really want a holiday too but wouldn't consider booking one anywhere right now when the situation is so changeable.
Thank you I have not seen this site.I agree with you. i am never happier than when I am away on vacation but instinct tells me now is not the time.Things change and life changes.
"good job we don't all have that attitude....By the time folk emerge from hiding behind the settee there would be no such thing as Ryanair, Easyjet, Gatwick Airport, Manchester Airport, Hotels.com, As they would have all gone bust...So its a case of use it, or lose it!!"
Been out all day Stath sitting ON my settee at the moment!! Out tomorrow too.Best wishes.
"I am meant to go end September to Malta and I think I will go, people I know have said they won’t go this year but will go next year on a holiday either way I don’t know what they think is gonna change between this year and next...somebody mentioned battleface insurance will cover for COVID in non essential travel countries I went to there site and put in I was travelling from and returning to Ireland but it would not let me proceed to quote if I was travelling from Greece for example it would....anyhow I have been thinking about this for a while now should I stay or should I go and I think I will...."
Excellent John. Hope you have a great time.Be sure to post a great witty trip report.Been a while since we had some fun stuff.
"dont forget john f ,while you wont have any travel insurance,you will be covered for medical expenses (repatriation excluded) with your EHIC card and the health service in malta is very good!"
Hoping to go in October - looks unlikely at the moment - but if the position changes and fingers crossed the numbers go down and we don't have to quarantine - we will be there!
Let's hope so! It's got rather worrying as the current restrictions (which are light) are not decreasing the transmission rate. I predict due to the lobbying by health professionals stricter restrictions may follow & I very much doubt the border will be closed again. It's possible all arrivals will need to have a negative covid certificate prior to arrival.With transmission rates as high as they are I'm surprised people are still opting for Malta. The last 6-7 weeks have been pretty disastrous.
"Personally I look for the death rate and it doesnt look out of control 10 people out of 0,441M is like 1000 out of 44M people. Most countries are worse than that.I hope I can go from 10-17 September. Only need the current situation in my country Portugal and Malta - no quarentine or tests and no mask to walk in the streets.Went to Paris and Nice last July and everything was just fine. Today I wouldn't go to avoid walking the streets masked up. I've only used it indoors so far.Edited: 5:37 am, August 28, 2020 "
"That's right Green Lioness (love the name!!)You go and enjoy yourself....But those low death figures don't fit in with the master plan.....Doesn't look great to say factually that ""more people are dying from foot fungus than are dying from this Covid""...sling on the infections numbers, and be sure to use the word INFECTION and not CONTRACTED. Fear is power. I will not obey.Hope you get to go....and hope you have a blast!Edited: 6:35 am, August 28, 2020 "
Thank you! I always like to see that around the world there are still people trying to enjoy their lives. They want us all sad depressed and stuck to too many rules.Most people died because of lack of assistance not the virus. in most countries general medical appointments are over the phone or with zoom. Some emergencies were delayed because they wanted to know the outcome of covid test before treating the patient. elderly people neglected at care homes...
"Most if not all died through an already frail body through either old age or a severe underlying health issue.Pneumonia has long been regarded as the death nail of many . My Nan among many others was frail and ill, contracted pneumonia and it was Good Night Vienna. Sad, but inevitable.Covid is a respiratory illness which is similar.Here in the UK death certificates were stamped ""covid"" despite no investigations being made.A road traffic accident? ""possible covid"". Reason? Nobody would check a ""possible covid"" infected corpse.Easier all round for the registrar and all concerned.Just recently 7 or 8 footballers have ""tested positive for Covid"" (Paul Pogba naming one)....there is more concern of the ""upheaval of the squads concerned"" or ""how it might effect the squads come the new season"" than anything else.No mention of any potential for tragedy for those concerned.There is indeed an underlying reason they are tackling this situation in such a draconian way. Slowly, but surely the truth is emerging.But the media are trying their hardest to keep us all suppressed.Don't let them Go on that planned holiday, have fun and enjoy yourself.#awaits posting deletion#"
I have a friend who has had the virus. Thankfully recovered but the experience was not pleasant and the effects lasting months.It is the people who deny that this is a hoax that worry me. Many people do not distance and I was grateful I was wearing a mask the other day when someone coughed without a mask as he was passing me.Enjoy your holiday but obey the rules. They are there to protect you not take your liberties away.
"Sorry, people that say this is a hoax I meant!"
"Tatty mate...You need to get a grip...People ""cough"" for a multitude of reasons...Its a natural reaction. You seriously going to spend the rest of your life, for that is what is likely to happen, jumping every time you are near somebody that coughs or sneezes....and ""thank god you had a mask on""?Blimey you may well live a long fruitful life, i fully hope you do but mate.....living a life like that? Certainly won't be a fun one will it eh?Seriously...."
"Indeed in the days immediately prior to lockdown we had to make a longish bus journey,the symptoms for Covid had been well publicised,I suffer pretty badly with sinus trouble,this was one of my worse days,about half way through the journey the tickle started at the back of my throat & that was a coughing fit which lasted some time during which I could 'feel' my fellow passengers moving away(all except for my ever caring Wife who said 'for f***s sake shut up!),made for an easy exit as everyone waited for us to get off at the end of the journey!"
"I can imagine alsnaefell lol.I enjoy life Stath don't worry. I have never enjoyed people coughing in front of me nor sneezing into the air on a plane, spitting in the street and talking whilst eating with food flying out of their mouths.Seriously!!"
"Hi, does anyone know what the rules are around a wedding out in Malta during Covid 19?"
Please can people stop discussing various views around COVID. This forum is used to discuss what is going on in Malta. Saves me trawling through pages of sh!te. Thanks.
