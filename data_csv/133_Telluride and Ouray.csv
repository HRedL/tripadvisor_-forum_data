What is your opinion about coming to Telluride and Ouray in the middle of September. We are also thinking of going to Silverton. We will be staying in our rv and wearing masks and social distancing as much as possible. We want to see the aspens change color and do nature activities. We do not plan to eat in restaurants or excessive shopping.
"Mountain towns have been overrun and busier than ever as everyone is thinking like you. Covid rates are spiking now in Colorado. 15 counties have been put on notice by the state if rates dont go down their opening variances will be revoked and they will have to roll back opening. Many of those are mountain communities. Campgrounds have been full. Dispersed camping areas are busier than ever.I live in Eagle county and local residents have been asked to return to safer at home status. Our schools are not opening on time. How crowds will be in September who knows? But lots of people are asking here.Edited: 11:04 pm, July 31, 2020 "
The “middle” of September might be too early for fall colors. This link has a map with the average dates: 9news.com/article/weather/weather-colorado/f…
"If you need to make any reservations, do it now! Everyone and their dog is coming to CO these days. :)"
Mid-Sept will most likely be too early for fall colors. The campgrounds are overflowing. The pandemic is surging right now. Consider this.
"Please let the good folks in Colorado get back to normal so they may still have a ski season. The responsible thing to do is stay home. Ray and Mike at the New Sheridan told me not to come, and I didn't."
"My opinion, now is not the time to visit."
"I think you might find the Durango CO forum posting about tourism in Durango, another mountain town in CO interesting - https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g33397…While in a pandemic where every stranger might be a danger we really wish you would postpone your trip to another year. The leaves will be there then and you can hopefully enjoy the view without worry that the welcome mat has been pulled out from underneath your feet."
"If you do decide to come, it sounds like you have realistic expectations regarding Covid restrictions and constraints. Are you familiar with mountain driving in your RV? In particular, the road to Silverton? It is not a route for the inexperienced mountain driver, especially in a large vehicle. Will you be towing a car for sightseeing? That would make scenic drives much easier. You might find a Ouray (or Durango) campground, then make day trips from there, leaving the RV parked. I wouldn't count on finding a place to stay in the RV in Telluride. Campground space is very limited."
"You will be just fine. Take normal precautions, just like you would anywhere else or with any other potential risk."
"Once again....Are you familiar with mountain driving in your RV? In particular, the road to Silverton? It is not a route for the inexperienced mountain driver, especially in a large vehicle. See video below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atn506YFK8I"
Good point Eric - - mountain driving is a much greater risk that contracting or spreading covid.
"Really ? I am really tired of the Covid19 deniers. https://www.9news.com/mobile/article/news/he…""47,968 cases, up from 47,716 day prior6,487 hospitalized, up from 6,474 the day prior.1,844 deaths among those who tested positive for COVID-19, the same as the day prior.1,710 deaths due to COVID-19, up from 1,691 the day prior.""Pretty sure that COVID-19 is worse than mountain driving"
"Yes, really, specifically as it relates to the OP."
"Skip Telluride. We just returned from a trip to that area. We visited Durango, Silverton, Ouray and Purgatory. We basically focused on eating most meals at our condo and doing hikes away from people. We were very disappointed by Telluride. It was crowded and it focused heavily of tourism. The food was not very good, there was no character to the town and it was a true disappoint. We thought we would would really enjoy it, driving 2 1/2 hours just to get there and it was awful."
"Fall colors may be a disappointment this year due to the drought I'm afraid. According to the scientists the word is that it will cause the colors to change early and drop very quickly. Hot Sept. days may mean less intense color also. It's been record breaking temps this month so who knows about Sept. but the entire state is in official drought now. I think I incorrectly said on another post that the colors would be late, sorry.https://rb.gy/y5mkko"
"@Laura I used to live and work in Telluride and am sorry you had a poor experience. I was also planning a trip throughout Colorado this summer and cancelled due to the fact I knew that my visit would be compromised. Please plan a repeat visit when things return to normal and you will find the town totally different.Edited: 9:04 am, August 10, 2020 "
"What a disappointment to hear about Telluride! Looking into going to the same area in a couple weeks, would you recommend staying in Ouray or Durango? How was it with the COVID concerns there?"
"You might want to visit the Durango forum here. Doesn't sound like the locals are excited about more visitors, especially from hot spot states. Maybe time for a visit to Flagstaff or Sedona?"
"Have visited both recently. No particular Covid concerns, locals overwhelmingly welcoming and grateful for the business. The only rude and nasty folks are the serial fearmonger posters here."
"Please read the post ""What is open in Durango now, and what isn't?""Before you decide to travel.Thanks!!Edited: 8:00 pm, August 10, 2020 "
Thank you. Almost went up to Vail and then was told Texans have been driving out here to quarantine (but were asymptomatic of course). I can't make this stuff up. Please don't come here in the middle of a pandemic. It is selfish and disrespectful to the people who live here. This is a public health issue and not about politics. Please don't be so selfish. Talk to a board-certified infectious disease specialist before you get misinformed by a news anchor or politician.
Agreed.
"On 8/10, post #19 indicates and overwhelmingly positive tourist experience. Yet their negative hotel review on 8/5 from their Telluride trip starts with ""If due to COVID complications...."" and states, ""staff was very indifferent at best (everyone walking on eggshells).""I'm sure there's an explanation of why ""indifferent"" and ""walking on eggshells"" has been described here as ""overwhelmingly welcoming and grateful"" just five days later. While their credibility has been lost with me, perhaps there are others eager to hear more about this seemingly dramatic contradiction."

"As I said, I'll leave it to others to draw their own conclusions about the contradiction, but I do not appreciate being harassed with rude names and am disgusted by the culturally offensive term used to describe this global pandemic on a family friendly travel site. Seems like a pattern, but I'll leave it to others to decide.From what my friends in Telluride and Ouray have told me, visitors are out of control this year and the situation is indeed tense, so the eggshell comment seems to agree with what I've been hearing this summer."
