"Hi everyone,We are travelling to São Miguel in mid-June, for 8 days. In your experience, is it normal for car rental companies in São Miguel to require a deposit when you book online? I'm looking at Micauto and Autatlantis, and both of them require about 20% deposit paid now by credit card. I'm worried about regretting this decision if we are not able to travel because of COVID-19. Thank you!"
"I'm worried about regretting this decision if we are not able to travel because of COVID-19 - it's simple, considering the situation hold your plans till end of April, by then we may have an idea till when the Covid-19 will have impact on our plans."
