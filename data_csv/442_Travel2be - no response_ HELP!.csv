"Hi - I booked a return flight from Newark to Goa, via Mumbai. The fight was cancelled due to Corona Virus outbreak, the airline confirmed this. However, I can get no response from the agent I booked the flight through and the flight was cancelled over 3 weeks ago. Any suggestions anyone?"
You'll just need to keep trying. There are thousands of passengers in the same situation at the moment.
"There are dozens of threads here about this company and their patent TravelGenio. Check those threads for replies from their agent about how refunds are proceeding.They are processing customers in order of travel date, so what matters most is when the trip was scheduled for, not when it was cancelled"
"Contacting Travel2be/Travelgenio is pointless at the moment. If the airline has notified you that your flights are cancelled, at some point they will get the refund to Travel2be and and some point Travel2be will forward the refund (minus their fees) to you. Just don't expect this to be a quick process."
"Hi Keith:Please, check this information regarding Covid-19:…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…Best regards."
