"Where exactly are you staying and where will you need to get to?Edited: 7:07 pm, August 09, 2020 "
Unclear where you need to go - we don't take ferries much except to go to Provincetown on Cape Cod so that's a bit confusing. Are you looking for suggestions for places to relax or a place that has wi-fi where you can work?

"Most of us have not spent a lot of time downtown recently. In East Boston, Piers Park is nice. In Boston proper you have the public garden and Boston Common as well as the Commonwealth Ave Mall and the Esplanade on the Charles River. As for museums, you need to check their websites. Museum of fine Arts is closed. The Institute of contemporary art is open but you must buy tickets in advance and so on. The water taxi dock is behind your hotel. I do not know if the MBTA Ferries are running but there is always the silver line bus.Are you aware of the COVID restrictions Mass is imposing on out of staters?Edited: 10:06 pm, August 09, 2020 "

"Coming from Illinois in the next many weeks you are required to quarantine in your hotel. Touring is not allowed, I am afraid."
"""attending a meeting""Please inform whoever is holding this meeting and flying in people to attend how stupid they are. Perhaps they intend to test everyone 72 hours or less before they go to make it 'legal' but that's still really foolish."
I hate when people delete their post after I take the time to answer. Now this thread is pretty useless to others
