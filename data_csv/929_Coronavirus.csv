I saw that the incoming planes were going to be met by health officials That way we having everyone answer a questionnaire before anyone was able to exit. Has anyone experienced this yet or had any delays because of it?
We flew down Feb 4th. Forms were given out and filled in on the plane. Someone was waiting inside the arrival area to collect them. No delay. While there we heard they were hiring people to take everyone's temperature upon arrival. Do not know if that is true.
"We came in yesterday, no forms, no temperature takers, no extra delay"
"In just a slight expansion of this subject.....When returning to the US from the island of Bonaire a week ago, as we went through the Global Entry line in Immigration, the agent there only asked each of us one question: ""Have you been to China recently?"". Since we had been in Bonaire 3 weeks (and have never been to China) we quickly answered ""definitely not"".I suspect that question is being asked a lot these days."
"I just left the island yesterday. When checking in for our flight home, the agent asked if we had been to China within the past two weeks. ~Happy Travels"
"Friends came in over the weekend, yes they had a form to fill out. Don't know what they do with the forms because they were collected randomly and some people's weren't even collected. One of the questions was ""have you been in a country were coronavirus is present?"" So all passengers from the USA would be answering ""yes""."
This is updated daily from the US Center for Disease Control: CDC. https:/…cases-in-us.htmlAnd the World Health Organization: WHOhttps:/…
Just traveled to Provo last week. Had to fill out a form on the plane and a lady took it when we landed. That’s it.On returning to the States nothing was asked.
"We were in the Turks from feb 16-22nd from the US. Once at customs line they give you a form to complete and then some random person takes it from you while you are still in the line. NO ONE even looked when collecting them to see if anyone answered ""yes"" to any of the questions that would put others at risk. It was a joke. We stood in the customs line for over an hour, with no AC in 85 degree heat and at least 600-700 other people. The line was out the door."
"edelingroup: Gotta love it. Feel bad for the 85 degree temp in the airport. T&C needs to get it together at the airport. My personal feeling, let the resorts pay a fee to Fortis (electricity company) to purchase more a/c units for the airport. Their livelihood is tourism. They all are part of a national tourism group.This would be part of marketed luxury and for us from America, basic.Edited: 3:48 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Sorry, about the virus. Seems they are disinterested. Again, got to love it. Fill out the form and no one looks at. Maybe the staff are speed readers?Edited: 3:51 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"edleingroup....wow, thanks for sharing your experience and info. The government has to take a much more serious response on the Coronavirus. Staff not even looking at the forms collected is truly unacceptable.Hopefully as more info keeps coming out, hoping they will. Just look at how much it’s affecting the stock market.As far as the long lines, we book Fast Track to avoid them for Saturday arrivals."
"Numbers you always talk nonsense, the airport has air conditioning and when I flew home on Thursday it was beautifully cooledLess of the nonsense and more of the facts"
Seems like numbers is on 'vacation'
"Not sure what the staff would be expected to do. The forms really are a little silly, there has to be a better way. One question, ""...are you coming from a country with any cases of the coronavirus..."" Every person from the USA(i think Canada also) would be answering , ""yes"". Who knows where some of those people came from if connecting in the U.S."

"No confirmed cases, no quarantining. Business as usual. The islands tend to be more reactive than proactive."
"I'm guessing they don't even have test kits in Turks and since they aren't really checking the forms, won't know if there are cases there until it becomes a large issue."
We are due to arrive March 29th to Grab Turks. My husband and I are mid 50's and our son is 7. Does anyone know if the cruise liners are still docking? We have 6 flights to and from the island and have been told we'd have to do a Medevac off the island if we had any issues. I'm concerned about being held on the island if a case shows up. Any advice?
"We are due to arrive via plane to Turks in March 22. I’m flying from New York with my husband and our 2 year old and 4 year old. I’d appreciate others thoughts on safety of making this trip and potential considerations of being on the island with 2 young children given Coronavirus. There are no known cases in TC and while we have some in NYC, they have been quarantined but I’m a bit concerned about the flight and just being in such an international airport. Any thoughts are appreciated!"
I read a news article that cruise ships are still going to Grand Turk at this time.
I'm traveling with a small child and would like to understand possible quarantine scenarios upon arrival into Turks and Caicos? And then again back in the US.
"Keep an eye on the news , it’s difficult at this moment in time with all the news, personally I would stay at home till it settles"

Dr Jim please forgive me for a correction:4 Bahamians were quarantined in Canada on a domestic flight in Canada that had a confirmed flyer on that flight. Bahamas has turned away cruise ships and currently there is no case of anyone with coronavirus in Bahamas. https://ewnews.com/coronavirus-four-bahamian…
"Well, I’m 99% sure we will not be going to TCI this year. Our 25th anniversary is this year. We originally wanted to go in December, but since bookings weren’t even available and the cost would be $$$, we started looking at other times. After seeking information here, based on our available windows and water temp etc. we had almost decided on early June, but I wasn’t quite sure (due to some issues at work). Well, now with corovavirus news getting worse by the day I don’t want to spend thousands for a trip that we won’t even be sure we can take. I did see that a lot of airlines are waiving fees if you book this month but it’s not clear whether that’s true if you book thru Costco which is our plan (their website is vague and I haven’t called yet).So...it’s wait and see for us. Maybe the world will get a handle on this and we can go after all and get a decent deal close to when we’d travel.And we had grand plans to also visit Disneyland and Grand Canyon this year as well. May be a stay home year for us.Stay healthy everyone."
Does anyone know the expected projection of this virus?
How do you book fast track for airport? I presume this is for when you arrive in t&c
We book Fast Track for our Saturday arrival and departure through Island Arrangements.https://www.airportfasttracktci.com/

"This Coronavirus thread is a lot like the recent crime threads, lots of people putting WAY too much emphasis on this when planning your vacation.Is the Coronavirus out there. Yup. Are there criminals out there. Yup.Here in Minnesota we have 1 Hospitalized case of Coronavirus.So far in 2020 we have had 3,254 people hospitalized and 95 people have died, FROM THE FLU. There are prevention measures out there and yet most still don’t get the flu shot. The at risk population for dying from the flu is the same for the Coronavirus. Didn’t get your flu shot? Why are you even worrying about the Corinavirus???You are much more likely to need the hospital just by driving on Provo’s roads."
"Big gg. That is very true, but the fact still remains that the CDC, WHO, airlines, being quarantined are all focusing in on this virus. I thought I had time to purchase my travel insurance now I am finding it excludes pandemics and epidemics unless you purchased it in January. Maybe cancel for any reason will cover it??? I have thought about cancelling my stay at Royal West Indies which I have free cancellation until March 17th and rebooking at OCW which gives me 24hr before my scheduled trip free cancellation."
"Vacay, cancel for any reason insuranceBigGG. perfectly said"
“but the flu”Known death rate for covid19 is at least 20x worseNo vaccineNo treatment to lessen symptoms (at least for flu there’s tamiflu)Not nearly as much known about covid19Woefully inadequate response/testing in US
"Shcheepmom- Media hype mostly. Businesses (cruise companies, airlines, etc) are way overcompensating because their lawyers and front line employees are telling them to, not because Of anything from the experts at the CDC. I have a health care provider in my family. Her advice, if you are generally healthy, ignore the hype, wash your hands, and don’t sneeze on people. On the CDC website today.Should I cancel my trip?CDC provides recommendations on postponing or canceling travel. These are called travel notices and are based on assessment of the potential health risks involved with traveling to a certain area. A list of destinations with travel notices is available at https:/…index.html.Warning Level 3: CDC recommends travelers avoid all nonessential travel to destinations with level 3 travel notices because of the risk of getting COVID-19.Alert Level 2: Because COVID-19 can be more serious in older adults and those with chronic medical conditions, people in these groups should talk to a healthcare provider and consider postponing travel to destinations with level 2 travel notices.Watch Level 1: CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to destinations with level 1 travel notices because the risk of COVID-19 is thought to be low. If you travel, take the following routine precautions:Avoid contact with sick people.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.Level 3 - China, Iran, South Korea, ItalyLevel 2 - JapanLevel 1 - Hong KongEveryone else is a level 0.They don’t even recommend cancelling trips to Hong Kong."
"We're on our way to NYC for St. Patrick's Day and to pub hop/site see for a couple of days. Call us crazy. We're also on our way back to T&C soon for a quick trip - call us crazy again. I booked T&C with cancel for any reason travel insurance, just in case. But I usually do anyway as we have elderly Moms. Wash your hands frequently, travel with Clorex wipes, wipe down all surfaces, use anti-bacterial soap, warm water and scrub/dry thorough, use hand sanitizer. Cough into your elbow. Say a little prayer. It all helps. I'm not making light of this at all - but at this point, I think the ""panic"" being driven by the media is a little much. And for anyone wanting to follow what's actually going on with COVID-19, here's a good link: https://ncov2019.live/dataAnd if you want to follow along with who has the ""regular"" flu near you, here's a good link for that: https://flunearyou.org/?campaign=FBtime#!/"
muylinda can you still get the cancel for any reason if you made your deposit back in Sept as I did? I think it has to be done within 21 days of your initial deposit??? Lesson learned. I have tried calling them but so far can not get through to talk to someone.
"Hi Vaca567 - My policy specifically says this, but with everything going on it would probably be best if you called your insurance company to see if they've made an exception for what's going on now with COVID-19. Or if there's an additional rider you can purchase. Good luck! COVERAGE CCANCEL FOR ANY REASONIf You cancel Your Trip for any reason not otherwise covered by this Policy, benefits will be paid for 75% of the Prepaid, forfeited, non-refundable Payments or Deposits You paid for Your Trip provided:a) Your Payment for this Policy and enrollment form are received within 21 days of the date Your initial Payment or Deposit for Your Trip is received;b) You insure 100% of the Prepaid Trip costs that are subject to cancellation penalties or restrictions and also insure within 21 days of the Payment or Deposit for those Travel Arrangements the cost of any subsequent Travel Arrangements (or any other Travel Arrangements not made through Your travel agent) added to Your Trip; andc) You cancel Your Trip 48 hours or more before Your Scheduled Departure Date.These benefits will not duplicate any other benefits payable under the Policy or any coverage(s) attached to the Policy.COVERAGE DINTERRUPTION FOR"
"Thanks Muylinda. It does read that you need to get it within 21 days of your first deposit. What I have decided to do is book with OCW that gives me more flexibility with the cancellation. This way, I will not be worried."
Well... we were supposed to go 4-24. Things seem to be developing rapidly with the ban on European flights in the usa.
"Is anyone else afraid if the US extends this ban to the Caribbean, specifically Provo? this is all happening so quickly"
Definitely following this thread as I will be going mid April...also wanted to ask about fast track arrivals..has anyone used them..I have 5 of us all arriving on the same flight and would like to expedite if possible
We have decided to cancel our trip. My friends in the medical field were quite adamant on this front. I hope those that get to go have an amazing time. So bummed.
"NBA canceling their season, that is big, still a media hype? No virus as of right now here, but suspected cases of virus on island? media hype? I am paying attention now. Thought seriously about staying on this rock, but this island is not prepared for this."
"How many folks have cancelled or postponed your trip? We are due to leave for TCI on March 14. Not afraid of the virus, just would suck to be stuck in a situation we can't control.., like travel ban or mandatory quarantine due to proximity of a sick person."
"Hey Jeff, Where are you flighting out from? I would be alarmed if it was anywhere within the US as cases are growing rapidly and anything can change in a matter of hours/days, such as flight restrictions, travel bans and like you said, you would not want to be quarantined on a island with minimal health care. If you are flying directly from Canada, I would say it's a bit safer for the time being as there are significantly less cases there and any travel bans or flight restrictions would occur in the next week or so if there is a rapid increase in cases. And then there are individuals who want to do there part in preventing the spread of the virus by not travelling at all....at least for the time being. Especially through airpots and airplanes (both of which are places known to carry multitude of germs)Ultimately, it's a decision you have to make for yourself. Will you be able to enjoy your trip, stress free or will you be worried the entire time you're here? I am flying out tomorrow from Canada for 4 days and have tried my best to prepare for any outcome!"
Right now I’d be more worried being on a cruise ship....or being at a mega resort like Atlantis or Beaches...all three I’d never do
"We canceled our trip too, so sad as we would’ve been there this week. We didn’t want to deal with travel restrictions etc. Weather has been beautiful here in Maryland this week so that has been a blessing!"
We canceled our trip this week for the exact same reasons. FYI we canceled three weeks ago! Didn’t even think it would be this advanced by now. Best to you whatever you decide to do. We have been to the Island twice and absolutely love it there.
Cruises are not docking in TCI.
Where did you hear this?
"My airline is giving cancellations for people traveling up to May 1. I am not traveling until the middle of May but if they offer it then, I will then decide not to travel."
We wait all year for our trip to TCI. Booked for 3/23 - 4/1 out of JFK. Cuomo better not shut down the airports or I will be a raving lunatic! I have plenty of Lysol wipes and my masks for the trip - I used to wear a mask on flights even before this virus so if we end up getting stuck in TCI for a month .... oh well. That's what credit cards are for!
Small delay but nothing to crazy
"We flew in from Boston MA on 2/29. We each had to fill out a health form. It was collected while we were line at customs. My husband was recovering from a cold and had a cough which her reported on the form : That was his only symptom. We were not stopped & nobody contacted us the 2 weeks we were on the island. But that was a few weeks ago, so..."

Perhaps you can trade it for a block of cheese.Edited: 12:20 am, March 19, 2020 "
"JamesB,You obviously didn't read in the other thread where I posted that once TCI made the irrational decision to close its schools for 30 days, I postponed our trip. Because even if the airport doesn't close, the odds of crime going through the roof and civil unrest in TCI, just increased exponentially. Of course, I was accused of being a racist and a fascist for pointing that out, so be careful you don't draw the same ire in TA. Just sent hubby out to Stop & Shop for early senior shopping. Wait, just got a call from hubby - Stop and Shop is PACKED! (6:24 AM). So he's going to wait for our local IGA to open and be one of the first ones in the door. This is terrible. But thanks for your concern and compassion. I hope Provo doesn't have a run on food next week. At least they can always eat fish."

"Lisa M,You can certainly block individuals. Very easily. Just like it’s easy to report someone for repeated posts that aren’t relevant for travel and annoying."
"Click on the persons name. It will open their profile where you can see their contributions and reviews. On my iPhone, at the top across from their name there are 3 dots, click those and you can elect to block the person."
"# 69..,you do realise that blocking doesn't apply to forum postings , don't you ?"
"I do....but I was assuming they were getting direct messages that bothered them. Either way, my message was trying to imply nonsense postings are tiresome. I tend to just skip past irritating posts. But sometimes I’m shocked at how much time people have that they can flood a forum with junk. In my opinion, if you are feeling the need to block someone you’re part of the problem."

Has anyone heard about what procedures turks will implement when the airport opens up on July 22nd
"Yes, you will need to get a test for Covid-19 72 hours before you fly and bring proof that test with you, on arrival you will have to complete a health questionnaire and finally you will have to showProof that you medical incurable that’s will cover any COVID related illness you might bring with you"
