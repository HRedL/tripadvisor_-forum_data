"Some rumblings on Twitter that masks may become mandatory in all Vegas casinos, Gambling Control Board will be meeting to discuss. Will you be more likely or less likely to visit if this is the case?This sounds like a nightmare to enforce, especially with everyone drinking and some people smoking. Touching the mask constantly to take a drink is a terrible idea."
"Since I mostly play slots, a mask requirement wouldn’t deter me from returning. I tend to look for empty slot areas to play so I should be able to keep my mask down when I have a cocktail but have no problem putting it on when people congregate near me. I think it would be difficult to enforce people keeping them on every second they’re in the casino."
"The issue I have with what you described is how frequently you'll be touching the mask after touching the slot buttons, the chair, cocktail glass, etc. You'd be better off without the mask and just staying 6ft away from others."
"There's rumblings on Twitter? Oh, that's unusual, must mean something."
"Credible rumblings, expect to hear more later today."
"I will go nowhere were I have to wear a mask for more than 20-30 minutes. I will not likely return to Vegas or anywhere until there are no ""rules"". Too many people go to CNN for their science."
I would like to bet $50 on its going to happen and casinos that do not enforce it will receive a fine and eventually lose their casino license.
MrNiceGuy - what's the odds on that bet?
"I agree , in the near term, masks should be mandatory. That said, I won’t go anywhere when it is required to wear one for any length of time.."
"I would bet that if masks do become mandatory, casinos will argue to allow more than 3 people at a table. Many gamblers won't come to Vegas if they are required to wear a mask, or they won't play very long. Casinos are already hurting due to capacity limits, they should be allowed to have full tables if masks are required."
"I doubt very much this will ever happen. Have you been reading the live reports from folks in Vegas since they reopened? Doesn't sound like too many folks are wearing masks besides staff. And as for physical distancing, sure doesn't sound like anyone is taking it seriously. Certainly not in the videos I've seen. Strictly from the reports I've read, sounds like the Cosmo is the worst offender. So not sure mandatory mask wearing is the most immediate problem. What's interesting - in all the debates regarding masks / vegas, I see next to nothing mentioning actual safety concerns. It's like the majority of folks just want to pretend this pandemic never happened."
Then my reservations are all cancelled. I'll make sure to let the hotels know why. Don't care if MGM gave me a Mansion for $500 a night. I have no problem going somewhere other than Vegas.
"I have no doubt it will hurt the casinos, since many people will simply not play or limit their time playing. But the Gaming Control Board is meeting to discuss, and it's likely to happen."
"Agree with PNS.This will cancel my September trip (and October ?), and I too will let them know why."
"I dont think it's people pretending this virus didnt happen. Im sure they are well aware that its here. I suspect people are just sick and tired of living in a cave and are willing to take a chance. They are adults and are weighing the odds. My reservations are made for August and Im going. I guess if I am forced to wear a mask,I will. But it will be as little as possible."
"I think voicing your thoughts to the hotels is a good idea, vote with your dollar. I would hope cooler heads will prevail, we shall see."
How long until upstate guy and FLWfan explain to Austin that wearing a mask doesn't substitute for social distance.
"Steve M, my point is the majority of people seem to be doing neither. :-("
"Something that isn't mentioned much, is the wearing of face shields. I get that this is full face coverage, hence maybe unacceptable to the casino even though the face visor is transparent.A face shield won't restrict breathing, and gives eye protection. They would also discourage touching the face.I've seen some Vegas dealers wear a face shield, and I think they would be preferable for cocktail waitresses since they are walking around a great deal, hence less breathing restriction would be a plus."
"I like the face shield, I've seen some pictures of the dealers at The D wearing these. Seems like they'd be much more comfortable over the period of a shift, and would discourage touching of the face."
I'll throw my 2 cents in. If masks are mandatory visitor count will be so low that most hotels and casinos will simply close again since it's financially not sustainable. Pretty simple math.
"Make it mandatory to wear a shield or a mask... and see what happens. Will the people who have refused to wear a mask/shield, but really love Las Vegas, relent and wear one so they can be in their ""Happy Place?"""
"This will most likely happen, and not just in casinos. As the numbers inevitably soar , and they will EVERYWHERE, this allows the politicians to say ""See we are doing something about it."" This will ,allow them to take a simple action without them having to consider more drastic measures. After all, they will try a number of things to avoid another shutdown. In many areas this mandate won't have much effect. Where I live no stores will allow anyone in without a mask already. You think chains aren't concerned about class action legal suites? They have to be able to walk in a court room and say ""We did everything possible to avoid this."" So it will happen.Edited: 12:44 pm, June 15, 2020 "
It could happen at one point for many of the reasons kt mentions.This post about rumblings with no sourced link reminds me of the post about Battista’s Hole in the Wall closing. They reopened btw.
"True, people love to feel like they're contributing by wearing masks everywhere. It's easier for politicians to urge people to do that rather than focus on contact tracing and massive testing pushes."
"I don't see a source for this info. I'm here on the strip at the Cosmo pool, and I've asked several people including employees and guests. No one that I've talked to has heard of this."
"The average person touches their face thousands of times per day without even thinking about it. So smart to have everybody wear a cloth on their face that is basically a sponge/petri dish for all of their droplets and microbes, so that they'll touch it about 15 times an hour, and then touch surface after surface as they gamble. And unless you're a complete moron, you know that people aren't washing their masks for weeks on end. Disgusting and stupid. The reason the WHO and CDC both recommend against handkerchief use applies directly to this. There's a reason they recommend one-use tissues instead, and it's exactly why this would only make sense if people were handed a one-use mask at the door, and then were required to wear it and dispose of it as they leave."
"@espn, Some casinos are offering the one use masks at the door. Perhaps if this ends out coming to fruition all casinos will provide them."
"Vital Vegas and Las Vegas Locally both mentioned it on Twitter. Apparently there is a meeting today to discuss, who knows what will come of it."
I know some casinos are offering masks. I'd be onboard with wearing a mask all the time in casinos if it were through the use of one-use masks that required throwing away upon exit. It would be ludicrous to do it with personal face masks for the reasons I said. They're basically just handkerchiefs that rarely get washed attached to people's faces. That only spreads respiratory droplets and microbes since people touch their damn faces so much without even thinking about it.
It's true about the face touching. I always push the elevator buttons with my face. Sure there are some strange looks but who knows where my fingers have been.
Think about the mask issue the same way that you do security in the Hotel/casinos. There are 2 real reasons for hotel security:#1 To protect the hotel and especially the casino. The top level security is not what is visible on the casino floor.#2. To provide the PERCEPTION that the hotel/casino is safe for guests. It's comforting that security check room keys at elevators. But does it really prevent anyone from committing crimes or causing problems?Making everyone wear masks will at least provide the perception that the casinos are safer.
Field of Shields. Build'em. They will come.
i'm going to vegas end of july and if masks are mandatory i'm cancelling
"If Trump said, ""I want everyone to wear a mask. I'm going to wear one,"" there would be so much red in Vegas.Edited: 1:48 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"I am close to booking the 4th of July at the Wynn. I'm holding off a few days until this is clarified. Having the pool, restaurants and gambling as the only three major options is already cutting it close for me, but i'm still excited to go. Having to wear a mask while drinking & gambling is a no go."
"As an FYI nothing is on the gaming control schedule re masks. If it is, they hid it from everyone."
"Are we actually debating information that came from ""Twitter ramblings""? Seems even less valid than those here who sometimes cite what a valet or dealer told them."
"I don't think we are allowed to post links, but the Las Vegas Review Journal just posted a story that masks will remain ""encouraged"" for now, but could change if Covid cases start to overwhelm hospitals. Good news for now."
"The Review Journal link on this:https:/…The infection rate for Nevada continues to decline (now 5.2%), and more consideration is being given to hospitalizations, that the medical services do not become overwhelmed."
"“ I don't think we are allowed to post links”Sure you can. Links are posted every day on all kinds of threads. The Review Journal is behind a pay wall, though. You can only read a couple free articles per month. So it’s nice to show the first couple sentences of the article to give some sense of what it’s about."
"Bear something in mind about the rise in hospitalizations, you have to take that with a grain of salt. Many people are finally coming into a hospital for a previously scheduled procedure or something that was put off for months. There is a backlog. I'm sure some are COVID infected but asymptomatic which would still count as a COVID admission."
This will repel a lot of people. I wanted to come from Socal to get a break on the masks. Should be strongly recommended but not mandatory imo
"It is and still will be ""strongly recommended"". Anyone who steps into a casino knows exactly what they are risking now and anytime. For a masked gambling experience, all one needs to do is go to any CA casino or Harrah's Cherokee, New Orleans and a few others."
I would rather have to mask to allow things to stay open over shutting things down again because of a surge/spike in cases. Medical masks are not that bad as they are less warm than the homemade cloth ones. Stay safe.
"Finally I understand! ""Strongly recommended"" and ""encouraged"" are like all of the questions on this forum regarding restaurant dress codes. When asking about dress codes, the person really wants to know ""What is the absolute minimum I can wear and still be served?""So what you are asking is ""What is the absolute minimum I can do to protect myself and others, and still be allowed to play in the casinos?"""
"KT,I like the “dress code “ analogy.Yes, “bare minimum.”Hunt"
ktinca nailed it.
"@Ktinca""What is the absolute minimum I can do to protect myself and others, and still be allowed to play in the casinos?"" - It's a good question, but not really asked by many. Based on some local videos and reviews, the question is more ""what virus?""Also, the casinos have not enforced the safety minimums (masks, distancing) except from their employees. It's been up to visitors to express their own level of consideration (or none) to guests and staff alike."
"Back in my late teens I went ""bare minimum"". It did not go well. That was the last time I chose ""dare""."
"Lol, it's not the same.The minimum dress code is ""something"" and the minimum safety precaution in casinos is ""nothing.""Edited: 5:14 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"I wouldn't call the protocols nothing. The employees sure generally hate them, barriers, constant cleaning, hand washing stations are all something. Everyone has a different standard of what acceptable is. All I'd really want to see is hand wash/sanitizing stations, automatic doors, and staff wiping down things often. Others want face shields and masks on all employees, masks on all guests, no pools, no in person check in, etc."
"It's only a matter of time for dress codes, anyway.Naked guy's money is just as good as anybody else's, right?"
"We have a trip planned for October but the more I read about safety precautions not being heeded, the less likely we are to go. I get that people are sick and tired of being at home. Me too but health comes first. I wouldn't find it too cumbersome to wear a mask if it would make me feel safer but, without everyone else doing it, it's a moot point. Safety precautions like wearing a mask, social distancing and hand washing have saved countless people from getting the virus. We'll go when selfish people can think about others' safety as well as their own."
I think people have already voted mask compliance is very L O W !
"it's selfish to travel at all if you know you'll be around people who are old or immunocompromised. if you're not old or immunocompromised, and if you're not going to be around those demos, then your risk of serious complications from covid-19 is infinitesimal. it's not my job to think about your safely if you're stupid enough to be traveling when you shouldn't. crazies like jgt219 need to exercise some personal responsibility. try being an adult just for a few minutes.Edited: 7:30 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"“ crazies like jgt219 need to exercise some personal responsibility. try being an adult just for a few minutes.“I think you’ll delete your post, or at least apologize, if you go back and read jgt219’s post again."
I agree everybody should stay away from you espn.
Some of those old people in Vegas may not be travelling. Some of them may be Vegas residents who are still working for a living in casinos and restaurants there.Some of them may even be military vets who have put their lives on the line to defend those same freedoms that the anti-mask people sometimes refer to justify their stance. Aren't they and all working people in Vegas who just happen to be of a higher risk age group worth protecting by the simple measure of wearing a mask?
"The thing is many immuno-compromised and elderly people want to travel, and also don't want to wear masks. Saying, I'm doing this for you is bs when they don't want what you are giving. If someone who is 80 with lung problems wants to enjoy a trip to Vegas with smoking, drinking, gambling, and no masks, who are we to tell him or her no? They know the risks, these people aren't children."
There is a lot of fear here. One of the big unspoken fears is that if you are around a lot of people who won't make the very simple gesture of wearing a mask----what other common sense measures aren't they taking?

"I made a post about this too but I guess your way of stating was more enticing as I didnt get as many comments as you. Lmao. Anyway, I knew they were going to go this route with everyone seeing the videos and crying about it and then all of the Vegas ads emphasizing mask wearing. However, like I said weeks ago, implementing alot of these precautions were not practical and that in that case they should just stay closed, which is not realistic tho, because they'd really go broke if they did that. So, yeah, now they'd have to deal with ppl trying to ""Vegas"" while wearing masks which would defeat the purpose of the masks. Not practical at all, huh? But they have to do these things to make the fearful happy so...In any case, if I'm happy with the progress of Vegas by the time my trip dates come and masks are mandatory, I will wear a mask."
"I'm guessing a lot of people here kept flunking their ""help an old lady cross the street"" badge in Boy Scouts."
"ktinca, I know a handful of people who rarely wear masks (unless it's required by a business or on public transit), but they do an incredibly job of washing their hands every 30 minutes, always having sanitizer, cleaning, etc. I wouldn't assume that someone who isn't wearing a mask isn't being careful in other ways. It's funny, the city of Phoenix posted a photo on Instagram of several city employees posing for a group photo wearing their masks. So here you have a large group, pressed closely against each other, for a photo op to promote masks. Pretty ironic."
I wish King Fauci would have proclaimed masks for all at the very beginning. If he proclaimed it maybe every Governor would have as well. Prince Sisolak never forced masks in Nevada. Hopefully Emperor Biden will take charge in January and lead us to greatness. For now people everywhere are doing what they want.
"Thought-provoking post, Professor In_Seeno."
Thank you Jester Cruiser.
"""ktinca, I know a handful of people who rarely wear masks (unless it's required by a business or on public transit), but they do an incredibly job of washing their hands every 30 minutes, always having sanitizer, cleaning, etc.""Actually I agree that there are a handful of people like that. But the vast majority of people act like themselves most of the time.Again I will say that NOTHING that has happened in the last two months has been a surprise to me. I am not a genius, most thinking people should be able to see what would happen, and where. Which groups and areas will take this more seriously than others, and which will have a different POV.Arizona did not react the same as California. But no one would expect them too. Unfortunately we all know what is coming too. I don't need anyone to show me that numbers are increasing. Nor do I care to hear any reasons not to take this seriously. Because it is what it is. I won't pick on you for being in Arizona. Anymore than I would say ""I told you so."" based on current Arizona results. It's not as if I'm happy about it. And FWIW, for those who may not realize it: The numbers will now go up EVERYWHERE."
"@SplittingI'm very passionate on this subject. However, I don't like the tone some people take towards each other on this and other subjects, especially here where we all kinda/sorta know each other. We do spend a lot of time with each other. Common courtesy is key. Whether you disagree on this or anything else. How you say things matters often just as much or more than what you say. Like I think I used the example of the car salesman this weekend vs my visit to Morongo two weeks ago. I'd wear a mask if one of the people on the forum wanted to meet me in person and I knew they were concerned about the virus out of kindness. A place mandating that I do it and being rude when I question why then is x employee allowed to touch his mask then touch everything in the room is better than me walking around without one just sets me off. Here are the latest numbers from the CDC which I think are still grossly inflated per Dr. Birx by at least 25%. Even in the 85 and older category, deaths are way way down from almost 5,500 a week at the peak to just under 200. This is despite red states reopening massively and every single county surrounding LA now not requiring masks just strongly recommending them.  https:/…index.htmEven though I trust the CDC as much as I trust a guy selling Rolex watches in the Stratosphere, true story BTW, the numbers are still a good reference point.Edited: 10:16 pm, June 15, 2020 "
I didn’t read all the replies but a vacation and masks aren’t correlated for me. Our lazy PM here in Canada I think wants to keep the border closed until a vaccine is readily available.
"People need to be told what to do, if recommendations or suggestions are no use, adult supervision is needed, make it mandatory."
"I work as security in a casino in Mn.and masks are required. You are right, almost impossible to enforce when people are smoking and drinking. Becomes frustrating at times. At the tables strictly enforced, plus no smoking at the tables. Only 3 at a table. We are going to Vegas the last week in July playing it a little safe and staying at Palace Station. Wearing mask is not a problem I wear one all the time."
"@MacUnfortunately people don't tend to have enough sense to do things on their own, and love having others tell them what to do as it makes life easier. That is why tyrants get into power.

Yes, life won't be great but it will be stable. I'd rather be wrong, fall on my butt a dozen times but learn from my errors then have someone just tell me the way to do things all the time. Through overcoming adversity we become stronger."
"I think masks make my anxiety worse. I probably won't be wearing one next time I get on a plane..after all, we don't ""have"" to wear one if we have a medical reason."
"I am not saying we are there yet, and it might subside. But at the very least the trends in several states that re-opened are quite worrisome. The lock down clearly suppressed transmission of the virus and without it we may be nearing the dreaded ""exponential growth"" stage in places. And unlike early March where it was mostly confined to a few areas, now it is everywhere. Again, maybe it will subside but you'd have to be in denial to say there's no danger. And wonder what it portends for states that opened later, like Nevada.So I guess my question for all of you who are so set against masks is what then should we do? Should we just ignore it? Pretend it's not happening and simply hope for the best? If it does turn out that re-opening under the current condition results in significant spread, please tell me what measures should be taken? Help me out. If masks are asking to much of you, what is your alternative.Because I've got some bad news for you, if SOMETHING doesn't change in our newly re-opened country of ours, in a few months we'll be faced with a choice of either locking down again or enduring several thousand deaths a day."

">>If masks are asking to much of you, what is your alternative.<<It's ableist to assume that everyone can wear a mask. Many people have hidden health issues that you or I can't see.

"""It's ableist to assume that everyone can wear a mask.""You've got to be kidding me. How many people in Vegas this weekend had medical conditions that precluded them from wearing a mask? 0.0001%?

"Hi everybody! Everyone playing nice in here? I usually like to look at statistics and then look at some more statistics. For example, on an average day in the US about 7700 people die. About 10,200 people are born. Now I could be off by a few here and there, depending on where you look. So that tells me that the population is rising in the US by about 2500 a day assuming no one leaves and no one comes in from another country. That's not the point though. The point is that people are dying from COVID, but how many more than die every day? 2.8 Million people died last year. From everything. How many more people will die this year than last year? The number is tracking about 66,000. 34k COVID, and 32k other. SO, if 2.8M people die every year regardless, 1.21% more death due to COVID is occurring, and about 2.36% more death is occurring due to everything. Is that a lot more death? Well, the death rate in 2019 is 8.782 people per 1000. In 2020 it is 8.88 per 1000. It has steadily climbed from 8.124 in 2008 to 8.369 in 2015, to 8.580 in 2017, to 8.685 in 2018.The point? This is higher than normal death year, but not by much. Those are facts. It's not my opinion. So, do with that data as you wish. I will wear a mask where required by the property owner and no where else. There's not enough risk to me based on the data. As far as being selfish, you are entitled to that opinion. But, you are not entitled to your own facts. Stop letting the media feed you crap, and do your own research."

"Jamrobino, I guess I don't know what you mean. There's more death this year than in past years, but a little bit, but it's been trending up slightly since 2008 anyway. The virus kills about .5-1% of the people it infects. I'm good. I'm not trying to convince you that you should be good with it, that's up to you. I'm not interested in being convinced. I'm not interested in convincing others. I don't need a herd to feel okay with the choices I've made and will make. I'll do me. I'll follow whatever laws and rules that are in place. OR, I will choose to not partake. If Vegas goes to all masks, I won't go. And they won't miss me. If I miss it that bad, I have a choice to comply with whatever they say because the casino is their property and I have to follow their rules. Or, I can stay home."
"I got the number in how many death were COVID on the total increase year to date on total deaths from last year. About 60k more people have died this year from everything than last year. 34k of them were COVID.So one can conclude perhaps, that fewer died of some other things since the COVID death number is over 100k, or that people that died of COVID might of died of something else anyway. But I'm not drawing that conclusion, I don't know, or really care.Edited: 8:50 am, June 16, 2020 "
"You presented your facts as having meaning, but without any context it's difficult to understand how they are relevant to a discussion about masks in Vegas.Masks may be only marginally helpful, but I'm sure the casino employees who need to work would appreciate you inconveniencing yourselves slightly to help protect them and their families. Or you can do what I do, which is not go because I don't want to wear one on vacation. But I won't go and thumb my noses at them. Quite a few people now from a certain segment of the country are using words like ""afraid."" They are doing that because they know it's about civic responsibility and not fear, but they can't say ""I don't care about other people"" even though they clearly don't. The reality is that some of you here would rather endanger employees -- and further, you're happy to communicate to them that you feel this way -- than inconvenience yourself on vacation. That's sad."
"No, what I said is that I'd follow whatever rules were in place. If rules mandate masks, like you, I'll stay home. I also didn't say I didn't care about other people. The facts do have some meaning. They are relevant insomuch that there is a perception of risk, and the reality (for me at least) is that there is not much risk."

"""Is it not concerning to any of you how easy it has been for the government to convince you to set aside you personal freedoms?""I hear this a lot, and must admit that I am not clear on this. Exactly what freedom am I giving up by wearing a mask? Freedom of Speech because the mask muffles sound? Freedom of Religion? Do some churches not allow those wearing masks to worship?The Right to Bear Arms? Possibly you are treated differently carrying a gun while wearing a mask?I could go on, but fear overkill might dilute my question. Exactly which freedom am I giving up by wearing a mask?BTW: Do you thing the old standard ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service"" takes away any of your individual freedoms?"
"How about the freedom to assemble.How about the freedom to practice your faith with like minded persons.How about the freedom to move about the country unimpeded.How about the freedom to participate in our economy without a mask.How about the freedom to practice a ""non-essential"" trade in exchange for money.How about the freedom to access our public lands."
I can tell you this: Masks required at tables. They were not required around the resorts-just recommended. 90% were not wearing masks
"#113, ....your right, just toss the constitution. Give the executive unlimited power and just rest in the assurance that they will willingly give it up when things ""get better"".That's a good plan."
"I've got some bad news for you Bob S. There's no such thing as an absolute individual right. Never was, never will be. You see, no matter the right, there will always conflict with another person's inviolable right. That's life. We've formed governments to try and give order and primacy of some rights over others but even then none are absolute. Heck even each Bill of Rights has many exceptions. They in fact come in conflict with each other. That of course is why we have courts, judges, and lawyers to deal with these conflicts on a case by case basis. The real world is complicated!You listed a bunch of important rights in post 111. I agree with all of them. Problem is, they in the short term are in conflict with a rather important one too, the right to life. For 70 million people that right is under threat. So is finding a balance between protecting the lives of 70 million people while protecting the rights you mentioned going to be difficult? It sure is! Will it require sacrifice? Yes it will? We've got work to do. But quit trying to say to efforts are somehow un-American when really the opposite is true."
It all started with Stop signs if you ask me. Show me in the constitution where it says Stop signs.

If you are going to change mind., you are going to have to give me something besides...I can't do certain things without a mask.BTW: Are you going to sue Costco because they won't let you in their stores without a mask?

"Some of you have really surprised me with your anti-mask statements, and I feel like a disappointed father when their kid does something stupid... A handful of non-partisan, really smart scientists and Nobel Prize winners have concluded this...""By analyzing the pandemic trends without face-covering using the statistical method and by projecting the trend, we calculated that over 66,000 infections were prevented by using a face mask in little over a month in New York City. We conclude that wearing a face mask in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent inter-human transmission. This inexpensive practice, in conjunction with social distancing and other procedures, is the most likely opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.""I realize people have different ideologies on this, but it is my opinion that if you don't wear a mask, you don't care about anybody but yourselves."
"SFGCMP:First off, nobody has ever said the lock down was intended to last until we find a cure. Not one doctor or scientist, not one politician. The lock down had 3 goals. 1. Slow the spread while we got our bearings and learned more about the virus. It worked! Numbers is most places met the low end of projections. Plus we now have a much better understanding of what does and doesn't work in fighting the spread of the virus.2. Enable our medical system to have time to prepare. A mixed bag here. Yes we have more PPE for health care workers. Supply chain issues have been sorted out. But after not needing them in March, we stopped expanding hospital capacity at all, which could prove disastrous if a major outbreak occurs.3. Create a more economically efficient system to replace the lock down while still suppressing the spread of the virus. This of course is the big one and we've failed completely. This is where people's rage should be focused because we've had 3 months to get a system in place and we have none. The rest of the world does and they are now re-opening with a high likelihood of keeping Covid contained. We have re-opened with literally no plan in place. The scandal isn't that the federal government has chosen a faulty plan. The scandal is they have no plan at all. One of the greatest threats ever to face our nation and our federal government simply quit trying a month ago. It is astounding and disgraceful.As for all your numbers and figures, more power to you. You know what? I might be true that ""only"" 118K deaths wasn't worth the tremendous costs of prevention. Maybe your numbers are right! But let me ask, at what point then, using your percentages, will prevention efforts be worth it? You do understand that's what it's about, right? 300,000 deaths? 500,000? A million? Because absent any measures all will be in play before this is over."

"“ I realize people have different ideologies on this, but it is my opinion that if you don't wear a mask, you don't care about anybody but yourselves.” - This is the truth!13"
"Thanks for the feedback Upstate. I appreciate thoughtful discourse As you know, you and I disagree on how significant the threat is, but the more or most concerning thing at least to me are the serious constitutional issues at play here and I don't think that people are nearly as concerned as they ought to be.As far as my examples specifically.Assembly, I believe ultimately the courts will agree with me.Worship: Linked closely #1.Traveling across state lines: I think the interstate commerce clause has me covered and I think the courts would agree.Participating in economic activity with additional burdens not imposed by the legislative process. I think the courts will call this taxation without representation.The right to earn a living. I don't honestly know how this might play out, but our executives have chosen who may and may not earn a wage in this country.Access to public lands. The executive will be required to show how limiting access to public lands has not done more harm than good.The court (not Wisconsin) has so far been reluctant to insert itself into this, and that's fine, they too understand the extraordinary times that we are living in, but though they have stayed out of it they too have not commented on the constitutionality of all of these issues that we as citizens are dealing with every day. These cases/issues will eventually be heard but it will be years before we have conclusions. In the near term we are left to argue these topics on travel forums and apparently questions peoples patriotism (though I don't recall doing that).I have three friends/acquaintance up your way that have joined a lawsuit with hundreds (maybe thousands) that says that the governor by requiring a mask to participate in commerce is essentially imposing a tax, and that his emergency powers do not give him the right to impose taxes. I don't know the specifics, I think it is being handled by a firm in Rochester. But even if it gets past the first level of the courts, its still years away from resolution.You can go back through my comments and see if I have called anyone's efforts un-american, I don't think that I have but there is a record so feel free to do so. Just as I don't take issue with those that choose to wear mask, I don't feel that I should be compelled to do so.Of course I could take the easy way out and just say that I have a medical condition (I don't), and as you know the ADA does not allow anyone to ask me what that condition is.I'm certain that there are a number of persons on this forum that are for more knowledgeable about these issue than myself, most of my information is second hand from friends and acquaintances that are more closely involved."
"KT, I guess I'm disappointed that you don't find my issues at all compelling. I give you credit for being one of the more thoughtful members of our little virtual community. No I would not sue Costco for requiring me to wear a mask but let me ask you this, would Costco require me to wear a mask if they weren't being compelled to do so?"
"Upstate, using my percentages? They weren't mine, they're facts. I didn't say the prevention wasn't worth it. I think we are in disagreement when the prevention ends, or at least subsides. I understand that while we are preventing COVID spread that people are going without cancer treatments, stem cell transplants, surgeries, annual breast exams, teeth cleaning and repair, AA meetings, church, and many other things. We are finally getting some balance here, but it needs to be a balance. Dying of anything is bad. I lost an acquaintance to cancer that would have probably died anyway, but his clinical trial was cancelled due to the lock down. I understand many of you think it's a civic duty to wear a mask in public, and many of you think it's selfish if someone doesn't. I don't have an opinion on this, truly. I simply said that after I evaluated the risk, I'd continue to wear a mask as I have for at least 5 years when in an enclosed space like a train or plane, and that I would wear a mask other places only if required by the property owner."
"KT,Sorry, my last post was incomplete. I do not have any social media accounts and I do not watch any of the cable news channels. As I told you in a previous post, I do not belong to a political party (never have) and try my very best to be as objective as I can.As far as the assembling that has taken place recently. I has been pointed out that was breaking the law though it didn't seem prudent to enforce it. But try to get six people at a Black Jack table and see what happens. If the blackjack example doesn't work for you, substitute restaurant and make the number of people fifteen."
"After all this discussion, I think we all agree- wear a mask."
"SMGCFP-I also will not go if masks are required and it is not because I am stubborn or any other names I have been called on FB. I just cannot breath well with a mask on, Tried it at our local MN casino a couple weeks ago=lasted 30 minutes. If I am spending money for vacation I'd like to at least be comfortable. I had to cancel our April trip, re-booked for first week in Sept. If I have to cancel that then I will wait till next April."
"""they're facts""Posting a bunch of percentages without context is not factual at all. It gives the appearance of fact and that's why people do it. But by it's very definition a fact is something proven to be true. You're not posting facts, you're supplying data, that is all. Without study and context data is a long long way from being a fact.If you want to have a debate about how we should proceed post-lock down there is a reasonable one to be had. But don't start it with a straight up falsehood that anyone ever intended the lock down to continue indefinitely until a cure is found. That's a dumb strawman argument that people who deal in actual facts shouldn't use."
"""...your right, just toss the constitution.""Nonsense. ""your"" Yeah, let's throw out homophones, too."
Thanks for pointing out my error DTC. I hope people didn't misunderstand.
"It's not a straight up falsehood. Unless you are the governor of NY or another state and know for sure it is. I don't they knew how long depending on what state government you're interested in studying. And they are facts. 8.88 people in every 1000 are dead in 2020 in the US. It's a fact. And it's data. It's both really. And I don't want to debate either. The find a cure comment was my feeble attempt at sarcasm that was trying to insinuate that the governments in a lot of states are making it up as they go. It was very frustrating to me to have Cuomo say 14 days and then decide on April 15, that we needed another 30 days to see what happens. Now, you think the facts are wrong, or you don't care about them, that's cool. I like to go by feel most of time. I stand by my comments. I think I've had enough interweb for one day. I'll check in tomorrow maybe. Or maybe not. Restaurants open for real sort of here tomorrow....super psyched. And I'll wear the mask when I'm not seated per the order."
"Bob S, I do agree these issues will play through the courts for years to come. I do think those who are trying to circumvent the lock down by filing suit are bound to be disappointed overall. I guess we'll see. No use arguing about it now.I haven't heard about this ""Masks are a tax"" lawsuit. My only question is, will the judge burst into laughter when he tosses it out of court, or will he be angry and sanction the lawyers who brought the suit for wasting the courts time?Although as a bar owner I'm interested in the precedent set were it to succeed. If protecting the public good is now considered an unlawful act by the government when it comes to imposing restrictions on a business does that mean I can now get 8 year olds drunk? I might have to start advertising in elementary schools, Free Jagerbombs during Recess!"
"I'm sure you are right Upstate. Constitutional issues, especially taxation don't really get the courts attention.It is funny though, I said the same thing about the lawsuit when I first heard it but apparently (and remember this is second hand) since the government is not providing a mask there is a burden placed on the citizen in order to participate in commerce. Apparently that's the argument (dumbed down so I can understand it).I agree that we have given our governors a lot of latitude to ensure the health of the citizens. Now it will be time for the courts to do what they do and define the limits of that power."
"Perhaps closing the toilet lid before flushing will become mandatory too? :""Flushing 'can propel viral infection 3ft into air' "" https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53047819"
I don't know jamrobino. People are already enraged that masks intrudes on their freedom so flushing with the lid down may push them towards armed revolt.
"So it makes more sense to touch the toilet lid that hundreds of others have touched, which now contains fecal matter urine, and apparently virus, followed by touching the door which hundreds of others have touched vs just flushing the d**m thing. And that is if the person before you was kind enough to raise the lid before they left. If not, you get to touch the toilet one more time, plus probably your pants, toilet paper and possibly private areas. Smart!!!!"
"""It was very frustrating to me to have Cuomo say 14 days and then decide on April 15, that we needed another 30 days to see what happens.""It was frustrating to me as well! To millions of us. But what was the alternative when dealing with a brand new virus while attempting preventative efforts we had never even imagined just months before? You want to know what else is frustrating? Cuomo and many others made some mistakes along the way. But again, what's the alternative? Are you saying because we weren't perfect we should stop trying altogether?You want to know what is more frustrating? My bar has been closed for three months and counting. I am certainly frustrated. BUT, guess who is even more frustrated? The families of the 118,000 and counting who have lost a loved one. So I guess you and me can suck it up and do our part."
They are going to have to adjust the timing on that auto-flush.

A friend of mine opened his bar in NY last Friday. Had a huge weekend apparently.
# 140Lol. That makes TP the devil's scroll.
"Bob, several did here in Binghamton too. Most got creative and had great weekends while still meeting requirements set by the state. A few opened full bore and ignored them. One of my neighbors packed in 300+ people with no restrictions. I am not happy to put it lightly and have let it be known. Setting aside whatever ethical considerations one might have, this will backfire badly. In NY most people are taking it seriously. So to see a packed bar is going to cause quite a backlash. It already has. Cuomo justifiably threw a fit over it and is threatening new restrictions on areas not enforcing the rules. He has the political will behind him to do it too. This isn't Alabama. Specific to bars and restaurants he's also putting the SLA on it. Trust me, you don't want to get in their crosshairs. More areas in the state are entering Phase 3 and re-open restaurants this weekend. It'll be interesting to watch.As for me, I technically could've opened in a fashion as I do serve food. But there's no money in it. I'm really Phase 4, entertainment, bars, and nightclubs. That's why I'm so p*ssed off. I want to get there. But if we screw up Phase 3 as bad as we did last weekend we'll never get to Phase 4. I did temper my anger a bit though. They're in a tough spot and I get it. I'm however a college bar, my busiest months March-May were wiped out and that hurt a lot. But June-Augest are slow anyways so I'm not pressing right now. I already got screwed. But for many bars and clubs June-August is their peak season and I get the urgency. But still, that's no excuse to be stupid."
"Another point to note. There's another place I know of that opened and essentially ignored the restrictions. Problem is several staff are in open revolt, saying it's unsafe to do so. So what do the owners do? Fire them or force them to quit? Over refusing to break the law? My god that would be the easiest lawsuit ever. And no, willful negligence isn't covered by liability insurance. They are in quite a pickle."

I'll be facing the same difficulties myself down the road. I've had the same guy clean my bar for 15 years. He has chronic leukemia and thus is high risk. When I re-open he obviously won't be able to. So I'll be ready to grab a mop. Lot's of places will be faced with this.But let's differentiate between unfortunate situations like that and the one I previously described where they are flagrantly disobeying the rules in place.BTW, I hope your friend is making some bank. I'm also thrilled to see a lot of my friends open and making some money. I just hope the idiots don't ruin it for all of us."
"If masks become mandatory I will still go but I will likely go less often. It will really be hard to drink and smoke with one! I only play slots. My husband plays poker and he will not go to Vegas if wearing a mask becomes mandatory during poker play. With mask wearing now being optional in the casinos, if I were to visit Vegas now, I think I would opt to wear one but I would practice physical distancing more so."
"“ Not spending my hard earned $$ to vacation in a mask in the heat ...”Have you been to Las Vegas before?If there’s a casino that doesn’t have frigid air conditioning, I haven’t been in it yet."
Yes I have . Many times in 100+ degree heat. Have you ?Air or no air I’m not wearing a mask everywhere I go on vacation .
