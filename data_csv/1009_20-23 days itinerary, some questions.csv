"Hello,Will be going to croatia 5th september to perhaps the 27th (Not set in stone)Since we will have a lot of time, and we also like moving around A LOT, we want to see as much as possible during these days.The itinerary so far looks like this:5th-9th Dubrovnik (Trip to Montenegro, some islands perhaps.. tips are welcome)9th-11th Going to Korcula (Ferry?) spending 1 whole day and 2 nights here (Thinking of renting a Scooter?)11th-13th Going to Hvar (Ferry?) and possibly renting a scooter here too13th-16th Split. Havnt really decided on what to do here yet, tips are welcomeThen the days after this are all up in the air. I'm thinking of renting a car and then just going our exploring by ourselves, all I know is that we want to go to the Plitvice lakes, but other than that I think we would love just driving on our own along the coast until we eventually get to Rovinj, or Pula.Now to the questions:1. Im a little bit worried about parking. How bad is it to find parkingspots in lets say... Somewhere around Zadar, Plitvice Lakes, Rijeka, Pula and Rovinj?2. We are going early september and leaving end of september. Is it wiser to go from the North to the South, or vice versa? Thinking of the weather."
the weather in the south is perhaps more reliable. I agree re Montenegro.
Tarik / Jude - do you discourage Montenegro because of the covid-19 risk to health or because the logistics of entering/exiting may be difficult? Thank you.
"Ok I will hold off on Montenegro, seeing Croatia is the taget anyway.With the weather being more reliable in the south does that mean you recommend beginning in The north and ending with Dubrovnik?"
Thank you :)
