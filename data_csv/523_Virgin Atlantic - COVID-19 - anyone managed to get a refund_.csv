"I have a return flight for the end of the month booked.Virgin have cancelled the outward portion (not sure how they expect us to travel back from LAS Vegas if we didn't go in the first place?)Tried to text, go a stupid message saying contact us when your within 72 hours of travelling? Makes no sense - clearly I'm not travelling?Can anyone confirm if they have received a refund for their flights and if so how did you do it? No-one answers the phone?I can't book another flight as there's no availability for the dates - and who knows if they are going under - so not worth it."
There's a recent conversation about this. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…
"I also got a message saying my outbound flight was cancelled but not connecting flights or the return. I contacted them on WhatsApp on Sunday and they came back to me Wednesday stating I was entitled to full refund, including extra paid to reserve seats. They said I would get an email confirming the refund within 21 days and the refund within 90. Hope this helps?"
"Sorry Dayton, must have been typing this reply as you posted the link to my question!"
"SJP - interestingly, I got the promise of a refund in 90 days, but no promise of an email confirmation, and my chat with VA was on 03/23...still no email or refund fwiw."
"Dayton - the lady on WhatsApp asked me to confirm my email address and that she would forward everything to the refunds team, but on closer inspection it actually states that the refunds team would “aim” to send confirmation within the next 21 days so let’s just say I won’t be strictly counting down the days for any of it!"
"thanks - that's great, will try WhatsApp"
An update - received an email today stating they received my refund claim.
"thanks DaytonJGVirgin still refusing to do anything with my request for refund - when was your flight scheduled for? Mine 28th, so they won't consider issuing a refund until after Saturday 25th - which to me seems like delay tactics. Presumably if they go under I won't get anything and I just think that's wrong.T&C's on the flight booking doesn't say anything about 72hrs before flight departure."
"I did have my flights cancelled by Virgin Atlantic and they said I was entitled to a refund and I would receive confirmation in 10 to 14 days, that was on the 7th of March, so far..... nothing. I have gone back to them and response to this was a standard message saying unprecedented bla bla bla. My feeling is they simply do not want to pay out"
"I dare say they'd rather not pay out, Michael, but to be clear did they say they'd confirm you'd be refunded within 10-14 days or did they say that the refund would be in your hands by that time?If it's the latter then I think it's a very ambitious target. Given the number of refund requests and the fewer staff available to handle them, even airlines are prioritising customers by date which means that refunds can take months rather than days."
"If they are anything like Virgin Holidays then you'll be waiting between 90-100 days...thats their current timeframe...both companies are a complete shambles, god knows what will happen when they merge into one."
"03/23 - refund promised via text chat - told 90 days04/21 - email received confirming refund05/08 - still nothing, but not 90 days yet, so why panic"
"We’ve been waiting for a refund from our cancelled holiday package since the end of March. First we were told it would take 10 days, then 14 , then 45, then 90 and now they cannot tell us when we will be refunded instead they keep sending us messages asking if we’d like a voucher instead! Has anyone received a refund?"
"As with the above, our flight was cancelled for the 28th May on 11th May. At no time was a refund mentioned in the alternatives and it is impossible to apply for a refund through their website. I have texted and now WhatsApped Virgin and I am still waiting to hear. This is disgraceful, it may be unprecedented times but they have had our money since November 2019. How companies such as Virgin Atlantic can flagrantly break Article 8 of EU legislation 261/2004 is beyond me...."
"My flight was cancelled mid April for our May. 1st Departure.. I spoke with a rep on April 14th after an hour hold. Finally got a Email confirmation on May 4th that our refund was in order and would take about 90 days to be credited back to our credit card. Think Virgin got some funding this week , so it’s looking better. However, They would not return our upgrade money."
"Puritans - did VA actually say they will not refund your upgrade fee - if so, did they say why?Thanks"
"Hi, I got through on WhatsApp to the team after a while but I went through general enquiries rather than CV option. My flights have been cancelled for July departure. I said I wasn't able to travel any other time and they were so helpful. I haven't had a refund reference number or email however ... it's only been a week. I checked my flight ref and that isn't there anymore so i'm hopeful its being processed. The person I was messaging with was so helpful. They must be swamped so just a waiting game in unprecedented times."
"We were due to fly out 19 th March. Cancelled 72 hrs before on 16 th March. Was offered to rebook but chose a refund. Told it would be with us 7-14 days. I have WhatsApp chatted at lease a dozen times , have emailed, telephoned, still haven’t received a penny. We were frequent flyers , and the refund is for £4900.00 Same response from Virgin Holidays for car hire. Except that they have told me to stop messaging them!"
"Scooby - your cancellation was well before ours, so I would be interested to hear when you do receive your refund. I know they are saying (and have said this for most of the time) 90 days.Did you pay VA For flight only and VH for the car hire Only or all to one or the other?"
"We are currently on day 63 of 90, fingers crossed"
Hi. Yes we are. On day 66 since cancellation. Booked flights direct with VA and car hire direct with VH
"Puritans #15Our holiday was booked with VH, they will be refunding this to us. I reserved (directly with VA) seating in the bubble and paid that extra money to VA.I have now received a message from VA to say they will also be refunding our fees paid to them.Obviously I know this won’t happen immediately but at least it’s on record refunds will (hopefully) happen."
"The latest reply from Virgin Holidays. Never read anything so ridiculous. - can’t process a credit card credit due to money laundering ! Never heard that one before. Good AfternoonUnfortunately, for our Accounts Team to process a refund it is a long manual process which includes many checks that need to be made prior to any money being refunded, this can involve money laundering, internal cross checking and so on. Added to that our 4 offices are currently closed and the staff are working remotely, which again is meaning the process is taking much longer than if we were working in the office surrounded by internal support. Due to these factors as much as I would like to be able to give you a firm date for your refunds I am unable to do so and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you further. What I can do is confirm to you that refunds are being processed by the Accounts team and I want to reassure you that your refund will be coming back to you and will be with you as soon as humanly possible. Thank you for your understanding during these unprecedented time."
We booked last August. I have tried to get in touch about a refund. They just say message. When you do refund is not even covered
Please could you let me have their whatsapp number
There is a group on facebook called Virgin No Refund Support Group. There are helpful numbers on there and many people sharing their experiences and frustrations.
03448747747 is the WhatsApp number for virgin
"Yorkshire - “ we booked last August” - it’s not when you booked, it’s on what day you are meant to fly they are looking at. They should contact you circa 14-16 days before that date giving you options, I,e, refund/rebook/hold. You really need for them to cancel the flight wIth you to get a refund - which could take 90 days or more .I think the WhatsApp # is 0344 874 7747. Text 07481 339184It’s on their website. Follow the top red strip headed Coronavirus....."
Was scheduled to fly on 1st may 2020. Flights got cancelled on 17th April. Have 30 emails exchanged with virgin Atlantic team. They just say we hve accepted you refund request but no concrete reply by when can we accept the refund.
"Sheetal, please read the other reports, it can be at least 90 days before a refund. It might even change as time goes on."
Sure we are all hopeful for that. Thanks
So reading through this - no-one has actually had a refund yet ?
Doesn’t look like it.
No. We were one of the first cancelled flights and we haven’t received a refund.
"I find it quite strange that VAA are still playing this game of not giving a reasonable period of time for refunds. I think if they explained the problems (magnitude of refunds to process , lack of staff in the office, inability for those working at home to access or process financial data etc) and placed a reasonable time frame on refunds then people would in many cases show patience. Just saying up to 100 days and then customers taking to social media and forums finding no refund success stories is concerning and will be counter productive.My flight for last week was cancelled 16 days before departure. Refund request made via their WhatsApp service yet they won’t give a refund date just “at the moment refunds are taking longer than usual and we do not currently have a time frame for processing these”. If they acknowledged the regulations but said with everything going on it will be delayed but we will process refunds for original departures xx day on w/c xx/xx/xx (perhaps in 30 or 45 days) I’d be okey with that. I can see this stance of non commitment, talk of at least 90-100 days and no positive payments coming to haunt them in many ways. I suspect many will get fed up and take the simple route of waiting for departure date + regulations 7 days then if no refund simply instigating a bank chargeback or (in the U.K.) a section 75 claim from a credit card. VAA then have to defend these, placing resource on responding to claims by banks and I believe take a penalty fee on successful ones. All this no doubt will take staff resource from processing refunds. The cycle of madness revolves.For now I’ll wait as I’d like to think in some way I can help them and the aviation industry get through this. However take the P* too long and I’ll hit them with a chargeback. Come on VAA get this working better."
I agree post 35 - I will wait until mid-summer and if I haven’t heard anything back I will look into a chargeback.
"I will try to keep this as brief as possible (Though sadly it isn't) ... My flight with VA to USA was cancelled on April 27th. I requested a refund via Whats app which I was told I could have but they would not give a time frame. Further requests via whats app for a confirming e-mail and time frame got nowhere. Phone calls went unanswered. I therefore used VA complaints process available on-line to complain that they had acted illegally by failing to refund me within 7 days. At least from this I got a response via e-mail which was sorry, we are busy, you will get a refund, don't know when! After three attempts my complaint remains unresolved but I have now given them 90 days as they requested me to be patient.Therefore I questioned my insurance company regarding flight cancellation, who stated I am covered but they wont settle a claim unless VA refuse to refund, so I would have to get that in writing from them. They suggested I contact my credit card company who I paid with.This i have now done (All banks are different so you would have to check). My bank were very helpful. Told me to file a claim under Section 75 and do it now due to them having a wait time on claims of about 8 weeks. They said they were inundated with claims particularly airline refunds.The process to claim was simple. One page form available on the banks website and attach associated documentation, e-mails etc.I did ascertain that if the bank pays you out on a charge back they claim back from VA. Clearly VA are stalling paying out refunds. I doubt they have any cash available and are hoping for a buyer to bail them out with a cash injection. So that's my story. Insurance won't pay out. My claim with bank credit card gas gone in. VA have been poor in responding, failed to resolve my complaint, and will not give a refund time frame. They always say on the bottom of an e-mail - 'We hope to welcome you back on board soon'.I have flown VA may times, but will I again - I doubt it !"
Ho Scooby hope you are well - Could you tell me the date your flight was cancelled ?Thank you
Check the virgin no refund group on Facebook. A few of them have got their refunds. Handful though.
"After 72 days passed since being promised a refund within 90 days, I was curious enough to text them back about it. Here is what I got texted back: ""Unfortunately we will not be able to meet the 90-day window for every customer, but we assure you that the refunds will be paid once sorted.""I'm reminded of Wimpy's quote: ""I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today."""
"Was due to fly on 22nd March. Flights cancelled on 20th March. So 76 days down the line, no refund yet. Have chased numerous times and had the same replies others have stated."
Hi Cancelled on 17th march
I have been waiting since the end of March for a refund they are so slow with any response and no idea when they will give me my refund getting really p off now
"5 pages of replies and still a no then! We had 2 separate flights booked directly with VA - for the 20th March and the 3rd April 2020. Both were cancelled by VA and refunds applied for online on 15/03/20. So far, no refunds and only an email to confirm that the refund request was received, not that it's actually going to be paid or anything concrete. In respect of the current difficult conditions, i have only chased it twice despite having heard nothing further, but I feel we're being strung along, as no real information being supplied (and in theory, we should be fairly near the front of the queue). I am tempted to claim through my credit card, but we partially paid with lots of air miles, so assume we would not get those back if we do that. Therefore hanging on for now, but they are not handling it well. Other airlines we had flights with have stated that the refund is confirmed, but will take 10 weeks (or similar) to come through, whereas VA have not even actually confirmed if we will get a refund or not, which makes it more difficult in deciding whether to try and claim through travel insurance etc. Not impressed."
There is a facebook group called - Virgin Atlantic Refund Action Group (Not Virgin Holidays) with some useful info.
A recent survey of people on FB got 260 replies. Not one had received a refund from VA.
"Originally we were told our refund for two return flights to New York would be paid within 14 days. Then they notified us it would be 90 days. Well, the 9 day period since our flight was due to take off has been and gone, and no refund yet. Just received another email from them today that it will be paid within 120 days !!!Given the fact that we paid for the flights 6 months prior to departure, they will have had our money for a year without providing the service offered. I'm beginning to worry we will never get our refund, so we are now trying to get our credit card company to refund the payment. Either way, I for one will NEVER fly Virgin again."
"I was meant to fly on March 27th; flight cancelled and I was promised a refund with “90-100 days”. Today (10th June) I have just received the following message:“ As a direct result of the crisis and the global travel restrictions imposed, we have been forced to make significant cancellations to our flying programme. As a result, we have been inundated with a quickly escalating and unprecedented volume of refund requests, which our teams are processing from home, with limited infrastructure.Unfortunately, this has meant we have been unable to provide the clarity you’ve needed regarding when to expect your refund - and this falls short of the highest standards we hold ourselves to. We are continuing to train and rapidly increase the size of our teams that process refunds, to enable us to accelerate the processing of all requests. With regards to your refund specifically, we commit that you will receive your refund within the next 50 days, but we are making every effort to ensure your money is returned sooner.”50 more days! That will take it to 4 months since I was meant to fly. Presumably Virgin is using my cash to finance its ongoing operations as nd unless air travel resumes soon it will go under with all of our money."
No its impossible
"I was booked on flight Cuba to Gatwick 2.4.20. The flight was cancelled. I sent various e mails to them as thie office in Havana. In the end they replied saying stop sendingUs e mails ,as were very busy and evertime you send an e mail you go to the back of the queue.Finally i received an e mail asking for a 6 digit number.I never have had one. I replied and have heard nothing further.My opinion is they are sinking.Alec Smith aleccuba2003@yahoo.com"
"Virgin are now saying it's 120 days...https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/12/virgin-atlantic-tells-customers-refunds-will-take-up-to-four-months#:~:text=Virgin%20Atlantic%20tells%20customers%20refunds,BusinessTime for a section 75 on the credit card I think."
"Just tried to make a section 75 claim on Halifax creit card, told that need to wait 30 days after email promising refund from Virgin Atlantic, which I got on June 1st.Not holding my breath on Virgin Atlantic refunding me by then."
"I was booked to fly Manchester to New York on 25 May. Requested refund when VA cancelled flight then similar story to those above with no clear response to my email to Refunds.HQ@fly.virgin.com. No answer after long periods on hold to Customer services. No refund reference number, and no refund status available when querying the VA website. This item in Guardian says VA are refunding people but estimate at 120 days now. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/12/virgin-atlantic-tells-customers-refunds-will-take-up-to-four-months#:~:text=Virgin%20Atlantic%20tells%20customers%20refunds,Business"
Nope. They confirmed we were owed a refund as they cancelled our flight for June. That was May 12th and they are “processing” it which translates to the don’t have the money and are hoping to get enough revenue to be able to pay refunds. I know I won’t ever book with them again
82 days and counting...
"Virgin are finished, they just don't know it yet.They've hardly made a profit over the last few years, that's why the government wouldn't bail them out as they did with EasyJet, who are making a profit.They're holding onto the money so when the inevitable comes there's something left for the shareholders.90 days turns into 120 days etc. - it's all to delay the inevitable.Section 75 on the credit card, chargeback or travel insurance claim if you're lucky.Don't accept a voucher, toilet roll is worth more..."

"Virgin Atlantic appeared to be using delaying tactics in answering emails, I was told that it would be 60 days, then 90 days, then back to 60 days after they sent me an email in June, So it would appear that after 2 months of attempting to get my money back it would take a further 60 days, They also stated it could take longer to get refund if I kept on asking for updates. Meantime I contacted my bank by phone explained everything gave them relevant flight details, cancellation, date I paid etc. I was to contact Bank again on the date of the cancelled flight , this time I had to wait an hour to get through to bank but they started to action my refund using ""chargeback"" told it would take a few days and the money would be in my account and could be used. But VA had 45 days to challenge this and the money could be taken out of my a/c . I received into my a/c the money on the date of the cancelled flight was due to fly! Meantime counting down the 45 days which should be Monday, will confirm with bank then that I can use this money and that VA cannot get their hands on MY money"
"Why not ask bank to try ""chargeback"" you should get your money back that way in a day or two and can use that money BUT VA has 45 days to challenge the ""chargeback"" and then get that money back into their a/c, so If successful with ""chargeback"" leave the money in your a/c for the 45 days."
Need to wait 30 days after the refund email from Virgin before the bank will look at a section 75 claim.Virgin won't challenge it.Need to get on this as Virgin aren't going to be around much longer...
https:/…www.virgin-atlantic.com
"Tomorrow will be my day 90, and I will contact Citi to see if they can reverse the charge."
"Its been only 30 days since Virgin cancelled my flight. They have refused to give any time frame of the refund and refused to send any refund emails either. They just say that my refund is been sent to their 'refunds team'.So if Virgin goes bust, can I still chargeback? Am I in legal rights to chargeback now, since they are supposed to refund within 7 days?"
Can’t hurt to inquire
"In the next few days you should get an email with a reference number on.When this arrives, contact your bank.Different banks have different criteria.Usually they make you wait 30 days after the refund email, but it's better than 120+."
Thanks @SandJ and @Northern_Traveler00
"What I suspect is you will get an email with refund reference number then they will contact you again at a later date with an email stating that this refund reference number will allow refund within 60 days or 90 days or 120 days with whatever they have decided. BUT it will be from the date of the final email you receive that the 60 or 90 or 120 days will start. Contact your bank and ask for chargeback and state that Virgin Atlantic are stalling and giving you the run around. I got my money back same day as plane was cancelled from the Bank in early May, I eventually received an Email a month later in June from Virgin Atlantic stating it would be another 60 days but money was already in my Bank using chargeback method."
...Really well done!First refund I've come across anywhere on any forum - credit to you.
"Congrats on getting your money back. Also your bank was good not to ask you to wait for x days.Edited: 3:42 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"Virgin have agreed to paying me a refund on a return flight to Atlanta, they have stated this may take four months to issue the refund...I complained and the said ""sorry you feel that way""..."
"What they meant was they might refund you by the end of October, if they've not gone bust by then."
I was due to fly out to Orlando from Manchester on 5th April but obviously it was cancelled. By law we are entitled to out money back within 14 days but realise this is an unprecedented time for everyone. I am waiting for a refund of over £8000 . The Travel Agents JTA Travel Group have not had a refund to pass on to me. They have managed to get the money back for Disney and the Villa. We have been in contact with Virgin Atlantic and have a reference number but we keep saying will be 100 days the now 120days. Not sure if anyone has actually received a refund .
I've spent a lot of time looking into this and I've only come across one person who's actually had a refund.All the other refunds seem to come from chargebacks on bank cards or section 75 refunds on credit cards.After 30 days of refund confirmation notification from Virgin you need to initiate one.The Virgin refund was to someone who runs an influential travel website.Coincidence? You decide...
"Virgin atlantic cancelled my return flight on april 1st FROM india so i was stuck there for nearly 3 months !!!They were no help whatsoever, was just left to fend for myself. I am safely back in the uk now via an air India repatiation flight. But no guidance or refund yet from virgin . I booked my flight through STA Travel who were excellent but they are awaiting action from virgin in order to refund me !!!!!sorry I couldn't give a more positive response !"
"Had a number of flights booked with VA March 28th and return June 28th and return still no refund, no email. Have tried to claim from VA credit card and they say upto 90days and cant claim till after the date of the flight...no response from them either....Seriously out of order, I dont think they have the cash to honour the refunds and are playing for time time to do refunds with money from new bookings when flights resume...hmmm is that not a ponzi schemeEdited: 7:15 pm, July 03, 2020 "

OMG just woke up and checked my text messages and had received one at 10.15 pm from Virgin informing me my refund had been paid back onto the credit card I used to pay for my flights. Just checked and sure enough after 105 days of waiting 70 text messages and 30 emails I’ve now got the £3500 back I paid for flights to Jamaica. A really poor customer experience with Virgin but very happy and relieved it’s all over.
I got my £2000 back from my credit card yesterday after 75 days. Still not a word from Virgin. Question is will you ever book a flight with Virgin again ?
"IanR - I haven’t received my refund yet from either Virgin Atlantic for upgraded seats, or VirgIn Holidays for our holiday - but we’re not beyond 45 days yet - but in answer to your question “ will you ever book a flight with Virgin again” my answer would be Yes, definitely.We’ve been with them for circa 25 years and have always been very happy. Hopefully all will be ok for them in the future."
Right now I’m not sure. Always had good flight experiences with them and love their Upper Class seats and priority lounges but they have really let themselves down with how they’ve dealt with their customers and the ridiculous length of time to refund money
"My flight was cancelled in March 2020 - it is now 11th July - I am patient, but really thinking this is not going to happen - I would urge anyone not to fly with this company again."
"So we were due to fly back in April, flights outbound were changed, not cancelled, so we took a voucher, hoping that we would be able to use it in the future. With the UK and EU still banning travelers from the US (I don't blame them), at this point I want a refund. Who knows when it might be safe to travel again? (Which makes me so depressed.) What are people's thoughts on actually being approved for a refund at this point? It can't hurt to ask, but I'm not sure if anyone has experience with this."
"jse107, if you requested and received the voucher not sure if you can now exchange it for a cash refund. The EU law says that a customer has to be offered one or the other. You can try contacting Virgin and see if they can honor your request.Refunds are taking the longest in general it seems for all airlines. Our situation's different as we did not book with Virgin but with Air France for a May holiday. That went out of the window and I had submitted a refund request since May. No way did we want vouchers seeing as how the virus was spreading so quickly. Anyhow, AF promised a refund finally after haggling back and forth for a month. I just called up and they told me it takes at least 90 days. Other airlines like Lufthansa had been lagging and the EC got involved since so many customers were complaining of not receiving refunds that they're ordered to pay up asap. Hopefully you can get your vouchers exchanged."
"The EU law says that a customer has to be offered one or the other. - Incorrect the EU law (EU261/2004) gives the customer the right to a full cash refund if the flight is cancelled but some airlines are just ignoring the law by only offering vouchersjse107 - I believe if you have not used the voucher by a certain date you can get it converted to a cash refund, contact Virgin for advice"
"I contacted VA and they did--without hassle--approve a full refund. I know it will take forever, but it's not as though I'm going anywhere....I hope they survive this pandemic."
TomC97 I was referring to the recent (as of March 2020) EC ruling specific to the COVID-19 cancellations.https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/passen…
"Flight cancelled March 18th to USAAfter contacting bank for section 75 to proceed, This was done on 23/06/2020 have now had money returned to the original account as of 13th July.The only other positive news possibly is that VA has had a bailout so many may get refund sooner than later but don`t hold your breath.Customer service has been seriously damaged ."
I don't think that the new money Virgin (VS) is getting will be enough to cover all the refunds that haven't been paid yet. They need to get flying again before that happens and their biggest markets are currently not open for business.
"TomC97 I was referring to the recent (as of March 2020) EC ruling specific to the COVID-19 cancellations. - The EC ruling did not change the passengers right to a cash refund if the airline cancelled the flight""In case of cancellations the transport provider must reimburse or re-route the passengers. If passengers themselves decide to cancel their journeys, reimbursement of the ticket depends on its type, and companies may offer vouchers for subsequent use. ""The airline can legitimately offer vouchers if the passenger decides to cancel the flight but the airline must reimburse or re-route the passenger when they cancel the flight and the choice remains with the passenger."
"""I don't think that the new money Virgin (VS) is getting will be enough to cover all the refunds that haven't been paid yet. "" - The bailout was specifically intended to keep them in business for the next 18 months or so with the hope then can get back in the air shortly generating income to meet liabilities including refunds."
Hi Did you get your refund from Virgin Atlantic? We requested a refund on 7/5/2020 and so far have received nothing except 1 email after we contacted them numerous times.
"I booked with an online travel site. When provided the option to take the refund or credit toward future flight, I opted for the former. I received confirmation of a refund on 5/30/2020 and since then it's still in the processing phase. I've contacted the travel agency and they gave me the response they are waiting on their travel partners to release the funds to complete the transaction. I'm hoping it'll get processed before our planned departure date of 7/30/2020. So no, I have not received my refund as well. I read online it may take 4 months for Virgin Atlantic to process the refund."
"We were in the US when travel to the US from the UK was stopped and flights to many US airports were cancelled. We were unable to get any response from VA at the time, spending many hours on hold on the phone (the WhatsApp and text services did not exist at this time), so had to arrange and pay for our own replacement flights home. We made a refund claim for our original flight back to the UK on 20th March. We were originally told we would get a refund in 40 days, then 90 days, then definitely within 120 days and probably sooner(!?!). The 120 days from the date of the claim were up on Friday, but no refund. I did get a reply to my WhatsApp message to say that the 120 days was from the date of the acknowledgment of the refund request (23rd March) so that is today and, guess what, still no refund. My credit card company will not do a charge back as Virgin have told them they will be paying a refund, so I have an open dispute call with the credit card company too, but this will apparently take up to 90 days to resolve and could not be initiated until VAs 90 day window to refund had been reached. My insurance company will refund the cost of our replacement flights home (£5.5k) but will deduct the amount of the refund that VA will pay, but we are still waiting to hear from VA how much the refund will be. Until we at least know this we cannot progress the insurance claim.We also have another flight at the end of June which has been cancelled, we have lodged a refund claim for this too, but have been told VA can give no idea of timescales for this refund, so am not expecting this one anytime this year!We keep being told that refunds are being processed in order, giving priority to those from March - ours must have been one of the earliest so if we are still waiting I don't see later requests being paid anytime in the near future"
Eyore - fingers crossed. Let us know if you do receive your refund.
"Had September Vegas flight cancelled by Virgin Atlantic, told to wait 90 days for a refund, then 120 days.Unlawful and unacceptable.After 30 days of getting refund email from Virgin Atlantic, contacted credit card company and made a Section 75 claim.Virgin Atlantic are penalised by the card company for this - contacted them (Customer(dot)Services@fly(dot)virgin(dot)com) and informed them I had made a S75 claim.7 days later get an email from them, refunded.Just a coincidence???Good Luck!"
"Boycot the bad companies,people will look at reviews before booking."
people will look at reviews before booking. - Some will but many wont based on the number who continue to use awful OTAs despite hundreds of bad reviews.
"Indeed. I've never used the online ticket floggers, so I have no need to avoid them, but despite their lack of my custom they continue to trade. That can only be because there's enough people who do give them money.I agree that bad companies should be boycotted, but it seems to be easier said than done."
Yes got my Virgin Atlantic flight refund a few days ago for cancelled flight in March
It would appear that the processing of refunds is now moving along.My May flight was cancelled 11 May. I instigated a refund request the same day.Email from VAA on 22 July saying that they are processing the refund and it would reach my bank shortly (it has not as yet). 70 days from start of claim to confirmation it was being processed.
Refund arrived in my bank today.Was due to fly last Saturday and cancellation was confirmed on 4 July.
Update on my cancelled flight from March - received the refund last week for the outward leg only - went back on text to query and it turns out that the return was never submitted! I have been promised it will be processed as a priority but no signs yet!It really doesn't take 4 months to process a refund and the fact that they can't even process the tax element quickly I think makes what they are doing illegal. I've had a bigger nightmare with Easyjet than with VA but at least they refunded the tax pretty much immediately! Good luck everyone!
"EstelleB, a lot of people are quoting laws about refund times, but I always say that enforcing laws is the difficult part. A the present time, things are what they are. Companies like Virgin are struggling to cope because of the incredible number of flights and bookings that have had to be cancelled. It's not so much a question of how long it takes to process a refund, it's more of a question of how many refunds are waiting, how many staff are available to authorise the refunds where that is required, and in what ways the company is trying to organise dealing with the backlog."
"Hi. Flight cancelled in May, was due to fly to Orlando 3rd July. Like everyone else, I contacted Virgin for a refund and was panned off. I’m happy to wait for a reasonable time for the refund, not 4 months. Contacted my bank for a chargeback 3 weeks ago. Checked the account this morning and a refund has miraculously appeared from VA. Coincidence or my bank has speeded up the process. Either way just glad the hassle is over."
I made my original request for a refund on May 26 via text message for cancelled round trip flights from the US scheduled for June 30 . Got a text response on Jun 3 saying they were processing it. Then no additional communication till July 22 when i received an email saying that I would receive the refund in next 2 weeks. Refund deposited back to my CC on July 30. I did file a complaint with Virgin Atlantic customer service (not sure that did amy good as I never got a response). Also filed a complaint with US DOT as Virgin took so long with the refund. By some strange coincidence I got a response from the US DOT a day after the refund was deposited.
"Let's hope they do as they say, or perhaps better if they can get the money to you in a few days rather than a couple of weeks. Maybe they have cleared some of the backlog now?"
