In today's Riviera Maya News:https:/…2020.html
Thanks Joan! It is sad that as a society this is even needed. Hopefully it will help to enforce the guidelines.
Sad perhaps that it is necessary but its a good thing if it leads to increased compliance.
"Joan- you know this is cool, and uncool that people can’t comply and be courteous to others lives. Here in MN I’ve been wearing a mask everywhere I go even when it wasn’t mandatory. I hope tourist get on this right away! I heard in Tulum they have a speaker or was it a banner in English and Spanish stating all should wear mask but I hear most visitors are not. Ugh! They said today we got 2-3 more years of this. Let’s be good to one another. Have a blast tomorrow and next week Joan! You’re a beauty!"
"I dont plan on leaving the resort, that seems to be the best way to vacation right now."
"Have no issue with the covid police, but am I the only one seeing the irony of mask enforcement with all the other crime issues that Mexico has, lol"
Hello Uoftn. I don’t see the irony at all. Especially in the heavy areas where tourist are. I guess I’m not aware of the “crimes” in Cancun. Maybe you could enlighten me?
"Refer to ""how to deal with police if stopped in rental car"" thread in this forum."
"Uoftn I tried that but Ive been stopped in a rental car and nearly thrown in jail. I’ve been stopped and bribed a few times in several different states of Mexico. However I guess I still don’t see your point. I still visit and I still rent cars. I still drive through the borders when open. It hasn’t stopped me yet. You must use basic sense while in any country, Mexico is no different."

"Lolol. Given the great concern these police show to the people in their region with bribes and shakedowns, I can see why one would obviously see their great concern for the health and welfare of others when it comes to enforcing other policies. To each their own - I'm amused.Edited: 7:17 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"the virus is destroying the tourist economy that is why it is taken so seriously,the murders and corruption have always been there and the tourists kept on coming..if any tourists are worried about the corruptionGO SOMEWHERE ELSE....."
"Police here in Cancun are one of the group's of individuals that have suffered a great number of deaths from Covid within their community. I don't care if they're enforcing the rules to protect themselves from being exposed or why they're doing it. But the evidence points to the fact that they are doing it. Fines are being given out and arrests are starting to be made. They are doing what we were told they would do. I'm seeing it for myself when I go out. Like I said, I don't care if they're doing it to protect their own community. I'm just glad their doing it."

Wearing A Mask Could Be Even More Important Than We Thoughtgrowing observational evidence suggest that a mask could protect you from developing a serious case of COVID-19 — by cutting down on the amount of virus that takes root in your body.
“The covid-19 Gestapo HURRAY!“The Gestapo murdered 6 million Jews and 6 million others. Careful with your casual metaphors.
"Babaloo, I did just that. After 15+ years and trips to the region, I finally decided to take my money elsewhere several years ago after a visit to the RM and the town of PDC. Shakedowns, scams on the streets by vendors, being ripped off at gas stations, being insulted by vendors when you do not stop at their store...I decided to take my money elsewhere. Shame really, some very nice people and beautiful areas but throw in all the scams with the drug violence, it was time to go elsewhere. I am not scared, just annoyed and feel other places/people are more deserving of my business."
"#18 You make sense. You were not happy visiting Mexico so instead of telling the world how bad that you thought it was you decided to go elsewhere. I think that shows intelligence. No one has a tag on their toe that says go to Mexico or else. Places change. What at one time appealed to some no longer appeals. No reason to bad mouth it, just go somewhere else or find a nice place close to home.Personally, I still enjoy both sides of Mexico."
"Agree wholeheartedly with post 14! We need to protect society (ourselves) from those who don’t believe in this pandemic, are too poor or ignorant to comply, or simply too arrogant to comply. As we know, compliance and enforcement in some areas of the US and in Canada and EU has been very effective, and tourist areas like the Riviera Maya need an even higher level of compliance and enforcement for public safety...I’m reading that the highest infection area of Cancun is in the nortH among local residents. Joan if that is accurate, is there evidence yet that these people work around tourists and the spread started there? Or is the spread mainly in the tourist areas?"
"Bluewater, I'm not sure what you mean by accurate evidence but I can tell you the areas that have the highest infections are all areas where housing is small and generally cheaper than other areas. As a result, it a VERY popular area for resort workers and restaurant wait staff to live. There's no way to know whether these workers brought it into the hotel zone with it whether they took it home with them after interaction with tourists at their places of work. My guess would be it's a little of each. And unfortunately, these are areas where there's a high instance of people not wearing masks. And in fairness, it should be pointed out that once at work and masked, they are around unmasked tourists all the time as many resorts do not require them after check in. I have a good friend who runs a taqueria where the buses pick up employees to take them to work. His customers are probably 90% resort workers and they've told him that practicality every day someone shows up to work with a fever. Each resort handles that differently but clearly there's an issue. Who's bringing g it to who though is the million dollar question. Like I said, I believe it's a little of both."
"roxian,,,thats great to hear you have made a decision and moved on,,maybe this is the wrong forum for you ?,,,,,,,unfortunately theres some on here who complain about mexico and they seem to not understand that theres a whole world out there and if they are unhappy then go somewhere else.....we have been here many years and we know these things go on but we have really had not many problems....Edited: 11:33 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Yes Joan that is what I was trying to ask, thanks.Edited: 1:11 pm, August 07, 2020 "
