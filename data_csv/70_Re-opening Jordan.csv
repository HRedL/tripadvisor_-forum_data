HelloDoes anyone know when they are talking about re-opening international borders to tourists?Thanks!
"i dnt think Australia allow citizens to travel abroad before end of this year.,so i understand.me too waiting to go back to jordanraymondamman pasha hotel"
"Thanks! I am actually currently based in Europe, and borders within the EU will re-open on June 3rd.Borders ex-EU are rumored to open 15th June, which is why I am wondering whether Jordan is starting to talk about them opening theirs?Thank you!"
"Wow sure that is another matter .i believe the country is dying to reopen for tourists cos so many people livelihood depends on tourism .i follow few facebook Expat groups . talks about ""Jordan reopen borders "" .check them out for update.cheersraymondamman pasha hotel"
"The Jordanian government has done and is doing a lot to ban COVID-19 from the country. Thank God COVID-19 did not get a real foothold in Jordan. Most of the country is COVID-19 free, and the lockdown is softened within most governorates. Currently, the government is focusing on repatriating Jordanian nationals. They go in a 14 days quarantine at selected hotels upon arrival.Although tourism is essential for Jordan's economy (10-15% of GDP), I don't think the government is prepared to take too much risk. Therefore it seems unlikely that the country will open its borders soon for countries where COVID-19 still is very present. I heard about Jordan considering opening safe corridors with countries with a similar level of control over COVID-19. I understood that they currently think of 16 countries. As far as I know, there are no dates mentioned when these corridors might open.Raymond, Australia, is also on that list. So who knows, maybe traveling between Australia and Jordan will be possible sooner.Sunny greetings from Wadi Rum,Bianca AbmaWadi Rum Nomads"
Bianca good to see you back on forum.during the Covid 10 crisis.i cnt wait to get back to Jordan.lets hope not too far away inshallahcheersRaymond
"Bianca, and Sweden, is also on that list??? Probably not, or? Sweden is ""expert"" on fighting corona, -:("
"Hello Khamlia,As far as I know, Sweden is not on the list probably because Sweden took a different approach and, at the moment, has many more cases of COVID-19 than Jordan. So, no good news yet. But Jordan is not going anywhere. So, be patient. Better times will come for all of us.Sunny greetings from Wadi Rum,Bianca AbmaWadi Rum Nomads"
"That I had assumed already from the beginning when I saw how ""our dear epidemiologist took care of us"". That other countries would refuse let us travel into so we not spread the corona there.He and the government are so scared that the economy will go bad here, so they would rather sacrifice health. It's awful after all. But people here are also so stupid and ruthless so it's not wise. Many people do not adhere to the restrictions we have received, go out even if they are sick and crowd in restaurants, cafes and the like. Not strange then that it is as it is here.If I could I would escape, but impossible, no flight, by car impossible also, neither by foot. I feel me like in the prison."
"La_eli87, the Jordanian government has not provided any information regarding when it anticipates removing the COVID-19 related restrictions and returning to normal, however, it sounds as though it wants to meet some benchmarks before it does so. Last Friday, a spokesman said that meeting a goal such as zero COVID-19 cases for 3 weeks in a row in Jordan may lead to the ultimate goal of “normalcy” which would include opening the borders. Getting to the zero cases benchmark will be interesting considering some of the inconsistencies in reporting the daily number of cases. For several weeks, one online source had not been including the number of Jordanian truck drivers testing positive at the borders in its daily totals, or the number of repatriated Jordanians testing positive when entering the country. For example, on Saturday, this online source provided “a summary of the coronavirus cases in Jordan:” as it does daily but in the breakdown did not include the 6 Jordanians (1 repatriated from UAE and 5 Jordanian truck drivers) in its “cases confirmed today:” tally. Numerous readers commented online on the story wondering why Jordanians who were entering the country as positive and being quarantined in the country would not be counted. The running joke was that the border was no man’s land with no country taking responsibility. This kind of number crunching would also provide some readers with a sense that the number of positive cases in Jordan is lower than they are. Anyway, at least the total number of cases to date that is being reported daily is consistent across news sources even if the number of positive cases confirmed daily is not. I think that that one particular online source started counting the repatriates and the truck drivers as of Monday (yesterday). I suggest you keep an eye out on some of the English language online news in Jordan – they are pretty good at providing up to date information and may even post something about opening the borders before any of the ministries do."
I found now this article from 20 May - https://en.royanews.tv/news/21064/2020-05-20
"@Bianca, where I can find some information about the list, I cannot find anything.I looked at Jordan Times, Roya news, Al Jazeera but nowhere is anything about.I want to know how it will be for us, already a couple of countries in Europe deny us. And I am afraid that it will be more and more.But what can happen if I manage to arrive to Jordan and have some certificate or so that I am corona free? They should not send me back, or?"
"Hello Khamlia,Currently, the government is working on the plans for when and how the country will open up. I use the same sources and, of course, the information that I get from other reliable sources. I am not sure when they will present the plans. As already mentioned in a press conference, the country will not open up before the 1st of July. So, for now, we have to be patient. Hopefully, they can present the plans soon so that we all can start preparing.Sunny greetings from Wadi Rum,Bianca AbmaWadi Rum Nomads"
"Thanks so much Bianca ☺I will watch the news and please, if you - one other also - hear something, let me/us know. Thanks one more time."
Hopefully soon we can travel safely. From Argentina we have a trip for January 2021.
This week I received a notice from the US Embassy that QAIA would not be open to commercial traffic until at least July 1
Are there any news on the reopening?
Not yet unfortunately. They are working on a plan at the moment and I think there could be quite some restrictions at first. We'll have to wait and see. As soon as there is a date surely it will be posted here. Patricia (Petra Bed & Breakfast - Horse Riding Jordan)

No news yet for reopening thw airport for allWe wish it will be soon
"Dear Partners,Good day from Jordan Experience Tours.We are glad to finally be in contact again after a pause in communication and a disruption in business. We hope your family and loved ones are well.Kindly note that we successfully prevent the spread of coronavirus, prevent loss of life and to reopen our economy.The tentative date for the reopening of our airports has been set for mid-August allowing for travel to and from Jordan to countries that have performed similarly with regards to COVID-19.The countries classified as green countries with direct flights to Jordan – Pilot 1st Week of August as follows #Austria #Canada #cyprus #Germany #Denmark #Italy #Lithuania #malaysian #Malta #Switzerland #Thailand The list of approved destinations will continue to grow overtime as in the coming weeks and months.Travelers from these destinations will not need to enter quarantine so long as they have undergone a COVID - 19 test 72 hours prior to arrival.We look forward to welcoming you back to Jordan.Thanks,Sally"
Flights to Amman Jordan from To recommence from August 5th. Above listed green countries can enter without quarantine.We have created a webpage with all relevant information so that anyone planning to visit can find everything in a single location. Will do our best to keep it current as new information continues to come to light.
"I was too planning of visiting Jordan, once they resume International flights.But I m seeing now that Greece was removed from the 'green' list. And I can't understand why.e.g. Italy (green listed): ~250000 cases, ~35000 deaths (!)Greece (not green listed): ~4500 cases, ~200 deaths...Even latest stats (over last 5d) for new cases:Italy: ~350 per dayGreece: ~35 per dayHow exactly Jordanian government evaluates 'low risk' countries?Will there be a re-assesment anytime soon? Heard there's one every two weeks - so when is the next one coming up?Edited: 3:27 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"At this stage they are still undergoing the categorisation of countries. The list is intended to list all countries as either green, orange or red. Orange and red countries have not yet been announced and additional requirements have not yet been communicated. Hopefully you will have some more clarity for Greek visitors over the coming week."
"Solocation, Jordan has been negotiating with other countries for several months regarding what requirements to put in place to allow travel to each country. While it sounds counterintuitive (per the stats you provided) to remove Greece from the green list, the number of COVID-19 cases and related deaths is not the only requirement/factor Jordan considers in its assessment. For example, one of the requirements negotiated is for a traveler to prove to the airport and/or airline that they downloaded the contact tracing app and that they have travel health insurance (not all of this takes place when you arrive in Jordan but in the departure country). While this sounds easy, for some countries and national airlines there are legal issues associated with some of the requirements that would preclude them from carrying out a specific function. (Not saying Greece cannot do any of these functions - I am speaking in general terms.) Hopefully Jordan and Greece will finalize their negotiations soon and Greece is placed on the green country list and not the orange or red.Edited: 5:20 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Solocation, you may want to keep an eye on the following official Jordanian government Ministry of Health sites:COVID-19 overall: https://corona.moh.gov.jo/enCOVID-19 and travel: https:/…Together-to-Reopen"
Thanks for the info and clarifications. Fingers crossed then.The plan is to reach Jordan via air (Aqaba Airport - Ryanair). Are there any indications that this airport will re-open of the 5h?
One more thing - I ve read somewhere that proof of a PCR covid19 test (<72hrs before arrival) will be required. Does that apply to 'green' countries as well?Cost of the PCR test here is at least 150EUR...and I don't think its covered by insurance.
"Yes, you need to show your COVID-19 test results at the airport (taken within 72 hours of your flight). The requirements for green countries are in the second link I provided. You also need to show proof of travel health insurance and that you downloaded the contact tracing app. You should check the MOH website periodically to see if Greece’s status has changed. Anything can happen in the next 5 days but I doubt the list will change now as the JO airports (AMM and Aqaba) have been preparing for the countries that are currently on the green list. Maybe later in August or September. According to the news, JO conducts its country assessment every 2 weeks.Edited: 7:55 am, August 01, 2020 "

"Solocation, do not forget the requirement to fill out the online health declaration form 24 hours prior to departure from your country. The cost is 40 JD. You mentioned you are flying to Aqaba so your visa fee (40 JD) is probably waived if you stay the requisite nights but this health declaration fee is not waived.In a nutshell, these are the requirements for green countries at this time:- online health declaration form 24 hours prior to departure (40 JD); can be found at www.visitjordan.gov.jo; you will receive a QR code within 24 hours- negative PCR COVID-19 test 72 hours prior to departure- testing on arrival; can't leave airport/terminal until you receive the test results- proof of travel health insurance- download Jordan's contact tracing app (Aman.jo ... yes, that is only with 1 ""m"" in ""Aman""); it can be found here: https://www.amanapp.jo/en this will be checked by airlines before you depart and by immigration or border control at the airports in JO- a visa if you are not eligible for VOAEdited: 8:27 am, August 01, 2020 "
"Thanks for all this concise info LegalRoverI can fulfil all items on this checklist - all but the PCR test, which I find totally unacceptable to have to pay in excess of 150EUR. My accommodation/stay would cost as much and I try to be on a certain budget. Yes, this is a leisure trip alright - but I m a budget traveller. Not all travellers can afford to spend $$$ here and there.You also mention ""testing on arrival..."" - what's the point of me paying the hefty cost for a PCR when I m going to be tested anyway upon arrival. I ve spent 50EUR to do the IGM/IGG test couple of months back (negative). I have no objection to be tested if they want it, but they should cover that cost.Unless I can get insurance to cover for the PCR, and they insist of having it as a prerequisite even for green countries, then I ll seriously consider if I ll be travelling there. They want to have strict rules, to minimise covid cases - I get it. But for me, it's a lot of money down the drain. It's disappointing really, if it comes to that."
I understand it's a lot of money but I'm afraid these are the rules at this moment. Depending on how things go in the next few months there may be changes to the requirements. Patricia (Petra Bed & Breakfast - Horse Riding Jordan)
"Solocation, I’m sorry these requirements are making it more difficult to travel to Jordan. Jordan has very low COVID-19 transmission and death rates. I believe it implements cautionary requirements to ensure outsiders do not significantly increase these rates. Jordan does not have a strong public health system and a significant stress on the current system could have an adverse effect in-country. I just wanted you to be aware of the current requirements and additional costs for green countries flying to Jordan so that there are no surprises when you actually take your trip."
"The negative test prior to departure is intended to ensure that people arriving to Jordan do not have the virus. The testing at the airport is a secondary test to ensure this. The approach is intended to ensure Jordan remains virus free.The prior testing needs to be arranged by the traveller and the cost will depend on your circumstances and the process established by your home government. The testing at the airport in Jordan is included along with the JOD40 online declaration required for entry.As such Jordan is providing that secondary testing without cost to the visitor. From the announcements made by those governments who are opening for tourism it appears that these types of requirements will be in place for many destinations dependent on a number of factors including their existing infection rates. It is unfortunately going to prevent many people from travelling at this time, but once there is a vaccine or robust understanding and procedures to contain the virus there is every indication that normal entry requirements will return.Jordan is in a very fortunate position of being a location where currently there is almost no risk of contracting coronavirus during your travels In the country. We believe that the government is hoping that this will appeal to many people and allow restrictions that will ensure the local population does not need to be unnecessarily exposed to the virus while recommencing tourism which is so critical to the Jordanian economy.In the interim Europeans are in the fortunate position where many countries within the continent are reopening to one another and they can visit within the region until the situation improves and other destinations become as easily accessible as they have been in the past.Hopefully there is some benefit in this difficult times for both;- the Jordanian economy, and - visitors who are willing to fulfil the requirements to travel and take advantage of the relatively uncrowded sites at Petra, Wadi Rum and Jerash.The government has indicated that they will be reassessing and making adjustments to the requirements over time so good luck that the process evolves to better suit your needs. Hopefully precautionary testing will become increasingly available in the countries with low transmissions which will allow them to take advantage of these reduced travel opportunities."
"I am coming to Jordan from Canada next year February 2021. By then, we may have an effective vaccine in place. In the meantime, a couple of small but signficant questions (as we are dealing with government). First, I can get a corona virus test here locally in Canada (Montreal). Do I need to have the test results 'in hand' prior to departure (it takes 2-5 days via e-mail).And I do NOT travel with electronics (computer nor smartphone). So how exactly do I download a tracing app? Does this prevent me from coming to Jordan? (as per current rules).Thanks to everyone."
"Jennifer, you will need the PCR test results in hand when you arrive in Jordan, so, to answer your question, yes prior to departure. It may not make sense since you are being tested at the airport in Jordan but the theory is that you could have contracted the virus in transit at the airports in the 24-72 hours prior to your arrival - after you got your initial PCR test at home. The airport test is an additional safety check. As for the contact tracing app, you will need a smartphone device to download the app. The app is a requirement and you won’t be allowed to enter Jordan if you do not have it. This is so that the government can trace your movements if in the event you develop the symptoms and the epi folks try to figure out who you have been in contact with so that they can monitor them as well if they become symptomatic. Unless you purchase a burner phone (Huawei and Samsung run about $65) - one that you will only use while in Jordan - then you will not be allowed to enter the country. Contact tracing is very important in Jordan as part of its effort to curtail the spread and quarantine those who are infected.Edited: 11:47 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"Hey Jennifer,The current requirements is that you will need to upload an image of your negative test results to the online declaration to be completed prior to boarding and you will need to show the negative test when you check in to your flight.However it is expected that these requirements will evolve significantly over the coming months - some countries that were early to open have already relaxed some of their requirements and some have strengthened them. Additionally the accessibility and response time of testing in your home country will likely improve over time. As such it is more practical if you check the situation in December when the situation will be further developed and you will have a better indication of requirements for your travels.Jordan has stated they will review the situation every 2 weeks and has already indicated that if there are no anomalies between pre departure tests and airport screening that they may remove the requirement for airport testing on arrival.Hopefully by February the process is far less restrictive."
"Thanks to everyone.Visiting the Middle East (Jordan/Israel in this case) is never an easy task. Now made more difficult because of corona virus. But it makes the trip that much more memorable. And I 'll be able to say, 'yes, I did it'; virus and all.They are talking about vaccines so maybe by then, I'll be able to show the authorities 'proof of vaccination'."
Another great advantage will most likely be that you avoid the crowds in Petra. I'm sure not too many people will travel so the ones that do will be lucky to find themselves pretty much alone at most tourist sites. Good luck and enjoy your trip !Patricia (Petra Bed & Breakfast - Horse Riding Jordan)
