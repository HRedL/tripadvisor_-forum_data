"The CDC has recently offered visitors an Advisory to help decide whether, when and how to travel to NYC and elsewhere in the US during the Corona situation.Given its importance (and usefulness), the AdvisoryIs provided here. Your comments and experience will be very helpful to many others.-""Should I travel within the US?CDC does not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the United States. However, cases of COVID-19 have been reported in many states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19, if there are other travelers with COVID-19. There are several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel.Things to consider before travel:Is COVID-19 spreading where you’re going?If COVID-19 is spreading at your destination, but not where you live, you may be at higher risk of exposure if you travel there.Will you or your travel companion(s) be in close contact with others during your trip?Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 may increase in crowded settings, particularly closed-in settings with little air circulation, if there are people in the crowd who are sick. This may include settings such as conferences, public events (like concerts and sporting events), religious gatherings, public spaces (like movie theatres and shopping malls), and public transportation (like buses, metro, trains).Are you or your travel companion(s) at higher risk of severe illness if you do get COVID-19?People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions (such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes). CDC recommends that travelers at higher risk for COVID-19 complications avoid all cruise travel and nonessential air travel.Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you get exposed to, or are sick with, COVID-19?If you have close contact with someone with COVID-19 during travel, you may be asked to stay home to self-monitor and avoid contact with others for up to 14 days after travel. If you become sick with COVID-19, you may be unable to go to work or school until you’re considered noninfectious. You will be asked to avoid contact with others (including being in public places) during this period of infectiousness.Do you live with someone who is older or has a severe chronic health condition?If you get sick with COVID-19 upon your return from travel, your household contacts may be at risk of infection. Household contacts who are older adults or have severe chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Is COVID-19 spreading where you live?Consider the risk of passing COVID-19 to others during travel, particularly if you will be in close contact with people who are older adults or have severe chronic health condition These people are at higher risk of getting very sick. If your symptoms are mild or you don’t have a fever, you may not realize you are infectious.Depending on your unique circumstances, you may choose to delay or cancel your plans. If you do decide to travel, be sure to practice precautions to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases during travel.

"UK citizens at banned from visiting USA from 4 am tomorrow, UK citizens are also stranded in numerous Spanish islands and mainland resorts. To me, it's like the whole world that's infected should self isolate for at least 1 week to let this virus run it's course."
"I think self isolation for a week is a good idea. 2 weeks is even better.60% to 70% of the world is projected to become infected anyway. That's a lot of people, and when you consider the mortality rate, well, gulp."
"If a significant part of the population becomes infected here, the need for testing and immigration controls become less important. These are important at the start of an epidemic to reduce spread, but less so if it goes on."
"""Herd immunity"" is the stance that the UK government is taking. Once you factor in the potential infections and deaths, plus the stress on the healthcare system, this strategy is not acceptable to the general population.Self-isolation is a good way to flatten the breakout rate and put less stress onto the healthcare system."
Thanks for sharing!
"A commentator over the weekend here in USA had some advice that I think it good ...don't count on the government to help you out here....everyone needs to do what they feel will keep them safe and healthy (paraphrased) . That is sort of what is happening here...I am hoping that stricter enforcement and shut downs are mandated from DCA but realize politics is really getting in the way here. Not sure I buy into the ""herd immunity"" but at the end of this crisis we can look back and see what worked and what did not.Edited: 7:55 am, March 16, 2020 "
Herd immunity is when there are vaccines available. This is not the case now and the only ones that may have immunity are those who have survived the disease. There is actually a question whether you can get this twice. We are all like the Native Americans and Pacific Islanders when new European diseases first arrived.

"""Herd immunity is when there are vaccines available. This is not the case now and the only ones that may have immunity are those who have survived the disease.""Good idea to boost up inmune system with Vitamin C as well as fruits and vegetables for now."
There is no scientific evidence showing that vitamins will make a difference. I guess they don't hurt but it appears that they don't really help either.https:/…coronavirus-vitamin-c-myth.html
"If you felt the CDC travel Advisory was helpful, you may wish to consider this article (citation in next post).If so, you may feel it desirable to await a date certain (after which attractions which interest you will be open and operating) before booking your reservations."

"I would also mention that it is possible that some people are genetically resistant to the virus. Humans are not uniformly the same. One estimate is that there are 5-10 undetected persons with the virus for each sick person identified. This will not be the end of the human race, but older persons, as myself, may suffer. I see there are officials in Washington now repeating what a local health commissioner said that the virus may last the whole summer. This will be economically devastating to many businesses. I belong to a small historical society in Ocean Grove, NJ, and their main annual fundraising event is a summer house tour. This will likely have to be canceled. The head of the group mentioned to me yesterday that there is a 8 pm curfew in effect there."
