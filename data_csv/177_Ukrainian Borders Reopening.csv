Well this sucks - 14 day quarantine if you came from US? I don't see much international travel in Ukraine this summer.
"Interesting list, especially the break-down by regions, with even Saint-Pierre-et-MiquelonBorders within EU/Schengen zone are now reopened, but travel from and to part of the outside countries still is restricted. So many people will spend their summer 2020 vacation in their country or within Europe rather than traveling to other continents. Around 95% of the visitors to Ukraine are from other European countries, relatively speaking not really many from the USA.Edited: 2:28 am, June 16, 2020 "
Im from Turkey. Do i need health insurance for coming to Ukraine?
Bloody paywall What countries have the 14 day quarantine
"The list/MOH's way of thinking is definitely curious. The govt has prolonged the quarantine till the end of July and has opened national borders to everyone (hasn't learned anything from the UK grim statistics), even to the most affected countries in the world, meanwhile the infection rate has been steadily on the rise (with the same number of tests) and in several days Ukraine has already moved into its own red zone. MOH is constantly shifting goalposts in different epidemiological criteria to lift the most affected areas in Ukraine from the red zone, to decrease the number of active cases. Looks like a public health disaster in the making.The list is perplexing. E.g. Iran and India are in the green zone, Singapore is in the red zone, which is of little practical value in terms of safeguarding your population from the currently undesirable tourists from the most actively affected countries. Keeping in mind that your own population have already statistically become undesirable for the purpose of internal tourism as well.As for international tourism, it has created this pandemic. Apart from a number of South East Asian countries whose sanitation and hygienic habits turned out to be superior to the rest of the world, there seems to be few desirable sources and destinations of international tourism at the moment. Neither the West (apart from New Zealand and Australia which are geographically Asian - do they have common sense in the air there in Asia?) nor Ukraine are among them."
My wife's flight on July 3rd has been cancelled.I understand from Austrian airlines that all flights to Ukraine have been cancelled due to the Lockdown being deferred to July 31st.Anyone heard any other news??
"You know Taurean,I thought that would happen. I looked at Austrian site last week and there were no flights available in July.I thought odd, I was going to share with you.I wonder if you will get same deal on a rescheduled flight."
Hi BeamsSpoke to Austrian earlier and it was them who told me about the lockdown . They did tell me that we can re-book at a later date
"Taurean, what is your plan now? Are you re-booking to August? Do you think it might change next month? There are some flights arriving to Odessa now: Wizz Air is flying from Budapest and IsraAir as well."
Natasha not sure.Austrian couldn't give us any dates that had 100% certainty Not sure what the position will be as LOT and UIA have no dates showing for the immediate future

">>> I think everyone coming from abroad needs to have a heath insurance that includes Covid19Hmmmm, you 'think'???"
"Hi,Can someone help me and provide me the latest information from Ukraine?I am planning to visit in July 2020 Odessa for 4-5 days. I am not sure if I have to stay there definitely 14 days quarantine or can I flight back on time before ?Thank youMichail"
Michael welcome.Everything keeps changing. My wife's flight to Odessa has been cancelled for July 3rd and Polish and Ukrainian airlines have no flights that we can see. Austrian told me that the quarantine had been extended til end of July.We have seen information from the UK Government that you will need proof of Insurance and a Ukraine phone to down load an app. If you don't have it then you may be sent to a centre to test. This may change and may be only talk.Look back on here and the other post and there are some links as to what must be done
"There is almost no insurance that will cover Covid-19. The only exception I know of is a government employee plan, and they are not even offering that any more."
