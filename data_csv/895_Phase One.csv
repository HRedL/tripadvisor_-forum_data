Asking those following Maui COVID-19 status: What is your feeling of the new Phase guidelines and is Maui anywhere near meeting Phase 1 or 2?
There is an article on Maui Now with a story about Phase One and Hawaii
"makes no sense, putting money before lives. think about it-first west coast came from someone coming back from se asia and the east coast got theirs from people coming back from europe and now you're going to open up certain parts of the country but people can still travel there. until they get more testing and a vaccine, it;s ludicrous."
Gov said yesterday Hawaii needs a downward trend in new cases for a 14 day period before thinking about doing anything. That isn't happening as of yesterday. 11 new cases yesterday. More test results pending.
"Shared for interest purposes only... here in Canada ... our provinical public health doctor for BC just announced today that there will be no non-essential travel in our province for the rest of 2020. She is not planning to lift her public health order. She stayed travel MAY open up in 2021 if we have adequate testing and public health tracing capacities or of course a vaccine. I am not sure what the US will do but Canada is being very cautious. Our borders remain closed with the closure extended yet again today.My province has done an outstanding job of minimizing cases and hospital pressures so can't really argue with the approach.Just sharing as an FYI. I know I am not booking any travel till late 2021.Edited: 4:16 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"Can you link to that info, westcoastvic? Thanks!~ Colleen"
Hi Neighbor: Here is a link with entire video as well as written info! Hope this helps! Be well & keep well!!https:/…
There's been a lot of drive-thru testing the last 3 days on Maui. Potential spike in new cases as those results come in.
"Nope. Maui has had drive through testing all week, in various locations-and Moloka'i also had some.We have increased cases on Maui--we are at 102 today, with thousands of tests still outstanding.Schools have been officially closed for the rest of the school year (through May); Courts have just stated no trials until at least June 1st.Nope....nowhere close for any ""reopening""."
"#4. ""... here in Canada ... our provinical public health doctor for BC just announced today that there will be nonon-essential travel in our province for the rest of 2020.""  Gulp. Just gulp."
Gov said yesterday Hawaii needs a downward trend in new cases for a 14 day period before thinking about doing anything. That isn't happening as of yesterday. 11 new cases yesterday. More test results pending.That is what you have to see to even consider a phase 1 limited opening. Since Hawaii’s industry is Tourism there is much rush to get back to work. They would probably need to be in phase 3 to even consider visitors. They would probably still need the 14 day quarantine for returning residents and visitors.
"Thanks for the link, KubaKrazy, but it doesn’t verify what westcoastvic stated earlier. (Sorry for the aside with regard to the original topic!)~ Colleen"
"Westcoastvic, jpirk and Kuba, thanks for bringing this up. I must confess to not being overly impressed with BC’s response - too much wishful thinking in my view - so I’m glad to see the comment about no non essential travel to the end of the year. That hasn’t made the headlines on CBC or the Vancouver Sun. Will watch the video now! I was just about to re-book Maui for Spring Break 2021, as we cancelled this year on Mar 4, 9days before departure, but now I’m rethinking that ...Edited: 10:05 am, April 18, 2020 "
"Think the Mayor just announced water activities only on the beaches, no walking or jogging allowed"
"Just to clarify my earlier post...In BC we have a public health order restricting all travel to only essential I.e. goods and services. This order is also duplicated across Canada. Yesterday,at a press conference Dr Bonnie Henry was asked what possibly might be relaxed or lifted going forward. She stated elective surgeries may start up again and schools may open in the fall with children rotating in batches throughout the day. She stated travel restrictions would not be lifted in BC for likely the entire year and she did not see travel of any kind commencing till 2021 at the earliest. You need to watch yesterday's press conference to obtain this information. Basically we already have the order in plac, she just said it would not be lifted or changed till 2021 at the earliest. Interestingly, she did provide her opinion on broader travel and spoke of Italy stating they were ""still reeling"" direct quote and went on to say she felt it would be a long time before international travel resumed likely post vaccine. Just her opinion but she is pretty plumbed in and respected by her international community.Our Prime Minister announced today an extension of Canada's border closure with the US. At his press conference this morning he went on to say it will be significant period of time before he considers reopening it. Months for sure.I share this just as a perspective to consider...sharing what is happening in BC. We have bent the curve. Our hospitals are managing. But it sounds very much like our public health officials will not be opening up our province for quite some time and are looking at a very slow and calculated opening of essential services only at this time IF cases continue to drop in the next 3 to 4 weeks.I too desperately want to travel again but I sure as heck will not be giving anyone more of my money till I feel I have some hope of actually getting to my destination safely, not impacting local needs and having amenities available. For me ...that is likely 2021 given everything I am hearing. But just my thoughts!"
"I watched the press conference, westcoastvic, and had a different takeaway. There wasn’t a hard & fast decision expressed, which is why it isn’t being relayed in news sources. As far as the US-Canada border, the closure to non-essential travel has been extended to May 20.Having said that, I agree that travel the remainder of this year is a gamble, and perhaps not best practice, big picture. Masses of increased moving about as we ease back into normalcy stands to set us back. ~ Colleen"
Politicians can say things like this because laws and rules never apply to them. How many weeks pay have they lost?
"Throughout this entire deal, I cannot understand anyone restricting more than 2 weeks to 1 month out. How can someone possibly predict beyond that. For the state of Hawaii, that we love, for your sake I hope this gets better soon. Tourism is your bloodline and without it, I cannot imagine all of our friends and their businesses making it very long. For BC to shut things off for that long is flat out insane!Edited: 1:52 pm, April 18, 2020 "
Ok ...bowing out of this thread. As I said just sharing what I think I heard and interpret as the immediate future. Time will tell! It will be interesting to see if what some see as alarmist is actually what is required. Stay well.
"Back to Maui......as I said, we are nowhere near ""reopening"". Here's an article from yesterday about the huge cluster at the hospital-which is getting bigger:https:/…Not only is it going to get even bigger *at* the hospital, it's already been found at Hale Makua (our largest nursing/rehab facility) and at the Wailuku homeless shelter. Classic example of community spread.....and to 2 very vulnerable places/populations.There was drive through testing in Hana, Moloka'i, Wailuku x 2, and Lahaina side this week alone. Those results won't be back for around a week.Because of the lag time from test to result AND the increasing number of cases......I can't see Maui lifting anything for at least a month."
