We’re planning to spend a night at Surat Thani and go to Samui next morning. Which ferry service is the fastest and which ones provide transportation from hotel to port?
"You may not get much of a choice, but get your hotel to arrange pick up at the hotel, if there are still any choices to get to a ferry. It maybe limited services on some of the vehicle ferries (Seatran or Raja) from Donsak. They all look like a skeleton service is now in place ...I read that Lomprayah have stopped all crossings, but can't verify that... there seems to be no announcement on their web page.All ferries usually offer hotel drop off, but with the way things are at the moment, don't count an anything be normal, there are lots of places closed or not offering usual services."
The ferry drop off service was available yesterday on samui
"I would not count on anything, being what it was yesterday or even today.... Total lock down is supposed start in Surat thani province starting tomorrow (April 7th to April 30th)No doubt many other provinces alsoI just went to Lamai, this morning, the roads are extremely quiet... most things at the Tesco mall, were shut down. Most shops and restaurants also closed.Nothing is going to be normal for a while yet."
"If think of it, next time in Tesco Lotous or Makro, check out the dairy (milk) section, along with other perishables, and see how the stock is.Locally, PKK municipality, mild supply was a bit thin. Maybe just an off stocking day, or supply line a bit slow, and saving more for Krung Thep.Or worse, they are expecting the 24 hr curfew, and a plan to minimize future losses.Be Safe over there. Shouldn't be too hard, minimal cases, same as here, supposedly none.....reported."
"Tesco Lamai was very well stocked with most things, I was very surprised... Fruits, veggies, chicken pork, milk expiring on the 17th... Lots of it. Still two lanes stocked with TP!!!!Perhaps others can comment on other food stores around Samui.I just talked to a friend on Koh Phangan, everything is pretty much shut down there too.It is not going to be much fun for the next while. Stay safe ! Wear a mask or make one if you cannot find to buy."
"in bangkok i have found the supermarkets oversupplied. lots of 75% off bargains on milk, fruits and other fresh food. i suppose that's a result of many people leaving the city."
#3 where did you see that? Not doubting you just interested in the detail
"https:/…koh-samui-lockdown-from-tuesday"" Koh Samui will impose a ban on people entering the resort island from Tuesday until the end of the monthConfirmed Covid-19 cases, six of them on Koh Samui. according to the Provincial Public Health Office.""Edited: 4:57 am, April 06, 2020 "
Cheers
"Not Me, is Hua Hin too boring these days?Stop spreading fake news.There is no ban to come to Ko Samui (or leave the island) and there won’t be one.Those few people left reading this forum should not rely on posts from people who are 500 or 5000 km away and just copy and paste what they find on the net."
"Did you read the news-blip, as I thought it was self explanatory.Unless BkkPost is putting out Fake News, then you better take it up with them. Not me.... or look, a funny 'NotMe'Or do you not want people to know to get a health cert before trying to enter the island.Thought that might be helpful information for any idiot an their way there.Geez, wish you people would learn how to read & comprehend before replying. 3 or 4 in 3 or 4 days. Damn contagious.........Edited: 10:29 pm, April 06, 2020 "
"Not Me, yes the Bangkok Post article was Fake News.There is no Mandatory Quarantine on Arrival in Ko Samui when coming from other parts of Thailand. No health certificate required either. Translation of official announcement here:https:/…"
A FB - blip by someone with a vested interest ???OK ... may be mistaken but didn't you say to stop believing crap on the internet / social media as untrustworthy ???Again ... direct you attention to BkkPost...NotMe
The link I posted actually includes the announcement by Tessabaan Samui that the news of a lockdown of Ko Samui (as reported by Bangkok Post and others) is fake news: https:/…
"Any reason why the so called 'unsigned letter' isn't posted so I could do my own translation. And see the lack of signature.Or why there's no follow up news-blip saying it's not official policy yet.Until something official comes out (not FB) or I see it in writing, I'll let people know what they may or may not expect, if dumb enough to even travel to Samui, which would be silly, since now no hotels.See what happens why you cry wolf / U & R, now your credibility, if ever having, is lost.Have a nice day."
Are ferries running in the opposite direction?
https://www.tatnews.org/
"As said and this is the paragraph that is relevant:""Hotels currently occupied, which are to be closed immediately after the last guests have checked out, must report the details of all guests to the local authorities. Any guest deemed at risk will be isolated and transferred to a designated hospital for quarantine or treatment"".People are not being kicked out on the streets if already at a hotel."
Nobody said people are getting kicked out of their rooms. Not sure why you object to perfectly legitimate and informative links from being posted. No need to cyber-bully
"Well too many of the usual people implying things that are not true or posting crap from afar, when they have absolutely no idea and reading and posting false reports, which are misleading.Stick to Toronto 7Craig and Not Me should stick to Hau Hin...You guys are the ones misleading people."
Walked to Chaweng on Monday forgetting it was a national holidayBut a couple of places were open and some big hotels advertising long stay rates
"@Jim people are posting links that are current and reliable sources. Very little added commentary.""stick to Toronto"" no Jim, this is a travel forum and I will post where ever I like. There is room for more than just arrogant ""destination experts""."

"#16 kennytaylor, yes ferries between the mainland and Ko Samui are running in both directions."
Thanks Chris Just keeping options open in case we need to hot foot it to BKK
"Best to either get your resort phone the ferries or check web sites'No Lomprayah ferry running to the mainland currently, I just checked several dateshttps://www.lomprayah.com/Looks like on sailing a day to KP. But nothing for BKK... I tried a few days ahead.This message comes up.""Looks like the route for this date are unavailable or sold out. Please select another date.""Seatran saying no trips available on their web page when doing a test booking. https://www.seatranferry.com/Raja ferries, look here and see if you can make sense of it! Sounds like some ferries are running.https://www.rajaferryport.com/"
"Jim P, there are 8 - 10 Seatran ferries each way between Donsak / Surat Thani and Ko Samui. All ferries can be booked in the coming days."
"It's getting weirder yet Jim & Chris with different info, who would have thought.Add to that, another vested intersted person stating on FB, he left & returned. Though, IF true, & if living there, would a tourist have the same freedom to use the ferry.Also, how the hell would you get to the ferry, say from Bangkok, with 1 train running (schedule ?) to Surat Thani, and iffy at that, and many other transportation services suspended.Along with Prachuap Khiri Khan supposedly only letting people that live & work here in. And they do have check point with large bottlenecks (southbound) as I passed one today.Why would anyone want to be a tourist in Thailand now ???Edited: 9:46 am, April 09, 2020 "
"I based my post on checking out the ferry websites. I can't add more than that... People need to try bookings for themselves and see how it works out.Edited: 10:27 am, April 09, 2020 "
"Those not a fan of ferries, if even able to get one, might get some relief mid month. From Richard Barrow:"" Bangkok Airways is reportedly preparing to re-open Samui Airport with two flights per day on the Bangkok-Samui route from 15 May 2020 ""Got to be a better option than rolling the dice with the ferries, that may or may not be running, then a 'slow' train out of Surat Thani.Edited: 3:46 am, April 28, 2020 "
I think there are 3 airlines flying from Surat Thani from 1st May
"That's correct, but I figured if anyone hasn't taken the ferry over already, to take the train, then they had no intentions of leaving anyway....or are simply idiots.From RB ... again: "" Official announcement by Surat Thani Airport that three airlines will be operating from their airport during 1-31 May: Nok Air, Thai Air Asia and Thai Lion Air. Nok Air and Air Asia will be daily and Lion Air will be weekly on Fridays ""Edited: 4:15 am, April 28, 2020 "
Try Phuketferry. They have ferries departing Surat Thani to Koh Samui. Some of their trips are still operating. I've been in touch with them a few days ago. You could go to their website to check those trips. Cheers.
"Phuket ferries does not operate ferries to the gulf islands, they are just a booking agent site.To check which ferries are in service, check directly, look at Seatran ferries:https://www.seatranferry.com/or Raja ferries https://www.rajaferryport.com/or Lomprayah ferries:https://lomprayah.com/timetableDo test bookings to see what is actually running or phone first."
