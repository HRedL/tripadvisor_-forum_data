"do anyone know if the buffet open for breakfast-lunch in fiesta americana, please?"
"I readied that buffet is not self-serving, but with waiters due to COVID-19 requirements"
"I got completely confused with all the changes due to COVID) just wonder how it may look like a buffet with waiters? waiters will bring small portions of everything?) usually, I put different food on my plate and do several trips to different stations! I don't think waiter would be very happy to go back and forth for my food...just wonder...trying to make a decision where to book, but I guess this is same for all resorts now?"
"They might be serving travelers from behind a sneeze glass. Then you would go back and get a new plate and they would serve you again. Just a thought, I have no idea what they're doing though. Otherwise I can't imagine handling the same serving utensil everyone else is handling during self serve/covid.Edited: 4:02 pm, August 10, 2020 "
Love a good buffet! Are they still allowing that in Mexico? I thought they werent??
I have been following fiesta Americana in Cancun on Facebook. Buffet is open. Less options. You walk the buffet but servers put food on plate from behind plastic. Fruit and cheese are on little individual plates and are wrapped with plastic that you take for yourself.
"I am copying and pasting this from another post regarding buffets at all-inclusives, I’m sure this differs from hotel to hotel. ‘Most’ all-inclusive with buffets are now offering pre-portioned self serve options as well as cafeteria style service, made to order cooking stations and ala carte options served by waiters; ala carte restaurants at most are also requiring reservations where the didn’t before, with limited seating to provide social distancing. In addition to room services you may also find food available to go at some AI hotels."
