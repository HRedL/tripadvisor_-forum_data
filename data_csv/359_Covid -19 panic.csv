"So i know there has been threads on this but I’m starting a new one . I’m pretty level headed , been pretty positive with traveling to Cuba from Canada. We leave in 10 days - but is anyone else freaking out ?! I’m finding it quite difficult to focus on my upcoming holiday - which by the way is very out if the norm for me, I’m pretty excitable! Of course like all of us the media is going wild with this story and rightfully so - but hoards if people are tell the prime Minister to shut down the airports , stop international travel , close the borders ...do you think that is in the near future ? ( I know ....and the lottery numbers are lol ) just want some feedback and someone to talk me down from my ledge . Are you cancelling ? Cheers"
If I am a survivor of this virus I am going.Only you can decide what you are going to do.More people survive than die from this.

"Hiya, Hereandthere043. My husband and I are scheduled to leave for Varadero out of Toronto in 3 weeks and yes I'm getting a little nervous. I'm curious to see what happens over March Break as it is a pretty busy time for travel to if there is any cases reported in Cuba - Varadero then I may reconsider but as of right now we are still going.Edited: 11:58 am, March 11, 2020 "

It’s quite stressful - I’m on a direct flight from Newfoundland to Varadero. I’m more concerned with what the airlines are going to do - I wouldn’t want to be in Cuba and left behind because they shut down airports / flights. I hate that my mind is even wandering there - I just want to pack my bikinis and look forward to it !
"""covid-19 is the same group of bugs as the common flu""Common cold, not flu. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoronavirusI'm reconsidering travel in the coming weeks and months for two reasons:- the possibility that a quarantine will be initiated during my trip, and I'll wind up stranded somewhere I don't want to be long-term- I don't want to catch the bug at all (elderly and immune-compromised relatives), but realistically there's a good chance most of us will get it sooner or later. IMO later is better than sooner, because if you have an outbreak that grows very quickly you put a large, sudden strain on the healthcare system. As many of us as possible should be doing what we can to slow the inevitable spread. Among other things, that means postponing non-essential travel.Admittedly I was relatively cavalier about this just a week or two ago, but this is a nasty bug that spreads pretty easily. Reconsidering past positions..."
"No, never thought of cancelling, this might be out last vacation anyway, if the stock market keeps going down...so it better be great."
"We go in 2 weeks. I think as long as Cuba remains off the travel advisory list we will go. However, at present we are booked for Cayo Largo and will maybe switch to Holguin due to large numbers of Italians seemingly still in Cayo Largo. Watching to see and will decide. We can switch up to 3 days before as we took the Hola Sun cancellation safety ring plan. My husbands place of work did send an email saying they don’t recommend travel and all travel has to be registered with them. However if your country is not on the advisory list you do not need quarantine on return."
It has just been declared a pandemic by the WHO director
"Holawe are going also...only wish it was direct from Vancouver, instead out of TO... Once back my wife and I we will hang round the house for 2 weeks also.....so a controlled panic...lolcheers."
"@8, I saw where the Italian planes were still doing their regular Cayo Largo flights last weekend, any word on whether they're still going this week? That would seem to be a big hole in the Italian ""lock down"" if so. We haven't definitively decided to postpone. Going to wait and see what happens in the next two weeks..."
"hola. WHO is kinda late calling it a panademic, triste. probably for the reason of world ecomonics, triste. they say the WHO is a skeleton of what it use to be because of financial cut backs, triste."
Some countries are taking these matters more seriously then others .Spain has banned flights from Italy and to Italy till the 23 th of March .We are on vacation a bit later this year it will be in June this time around and to be honest i would like to go on vacation but if i have to cancel not a problem i always can go later health is more important then a vacation .Today i went to a Hospital in Montreal never saw the Hospital so quiet not many people around usually its packed . I guess many people are taking this virus seriously and just stay home .
"hola. worried about planes from Italy? what about Canada? is there not the possibility that Canada today maybe is a Italy a month and a half ago. what is happening in Italy must be a wake up call. 'Italy appeared well ahead of the curve when the coronavirus outbreak began to spread outside China.After detecting three cases, including two Chinese tourists at the end of January, patients were isolated in a hospital in Rome. Contacts were traced, and the country became one of the world’s first to cut transport links with China. The sense of confidence was palpable. “The system of prevention put into place by Italy is the most rigorous in Europe,” the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, boasted on 31 January. In reality, as would become clear in February, the virus had been circulating unnoticed in northern Italy via other local chains of infection, in all probability since mid-January' look where it is now, no bueno. ps - if i was Cuba i'd also be worried about Canada and other parts of the world."
My guess is flights from Italy might continue to retrieve those Italians in Cuba.I am sure that WHO is calling it at pandemic because it now meets their definition. I doubt that budget cuts affect that.
"I just booked for end of April. My biggest worry is that our trip will be cancelled, or worse, cancelled when we're already in Cuba."
"""is there not the possibility that Canada today maybe is a Italy a month and a half ago.""That certainly is a possibility, and a reason we're seriously considering postponing our upcoming trip. In other words, not only concerned about what we might catch while travelling but also what we might unknowingly spread.But what's puzzling about Italy is that on the one hand they ""locked down"" first a major region, pop. 16 million, then the whole country, and yet apparently Italian tourists (departing Milan, no less) were still going on their trips as recently as last weekend. I'm no public health expert but that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, does it?"
"hola. and lo siento to be like this, it might of and i'd say, probably was a week ago, but, world ecomonics, money, triste."
"hola. reply #17, money."
"hola. no reason, to panic, yet. Sars, 2003, 8,000 cases world wide 800 deaths. a hang nail."
"I think people that don't have compromised immune systems and are younger shouldn't be worrying so much about contracting this nasty bug. The odds have it that if you fit into that demographic, you'll survive the coronavirus. I fit into that group myself, so am I worried? No! I know I'm going to get it eventually and survive it without too much trouble.But it's my parents I worry about... both 84 years old. I just spoke to my father last night on the phone and suggested that he not make any nonessential trips outside the house now... doctor's appointments only. I suggested that he call me if he needs anything else, groceries included... I'll buy it, put it in a box, set it on their doorstep, ring the bell and back away. My father laughed at that suggestion... but I truly believe that within a week or two, nobody will be laughing about this very serious situation anymore... especially when it involves our senior citizens.Back on topic... I'll be traveling to Cuba without any worries. Unless you're within that other demographic of more vulnerability, I don't think anyone else should be worried about continuing to travel to Cuba either.TerryEdited: 1:24 pm, March 11, 2020 "
NOW that it is classified as a pandemic will regulations with air travel for Canadians change? I know it is predominately on an entire different continent and they are hugely impacted - but what does it mean for us?
"hola. i'm a smoker cigs(28 years) and weed(43 years,lol). i'm 58, and i feel good, happy, but will my lungs allow me to survive that 1% chance i get it. i have a feeling not. reality, maybe."
"The northern Italy lockdown started on Sunday, extended to the whole country on Monday. It is possible that the flights in question departed before either order, not the kind of digging I'm inclined to do right now..."
"@24 :) No wonder my keyboard gets a vibe when I'm reading/trying to get you :) We have a lot in common/age...I gave up the cigs 20 years ago...the other since grade 9 :) I know its off topic but since we all could be getting sick, I made a lot of changes not just 20 years ago but this last year as well...it's about extending life, feeling good, and extending the partying of course :) To answer your question...no, you don't want to get the 1% right now...at least not until you quit the cigs and try the exercise thing...I keep it simple :) and dance/run/walk fast/sometimes jump around the kitchen to some music that nobody else would like...you can always have a few puffs before you begin :)"
HaremmistressLMAO!
I meant I've been doing that since grade 9....can you tell? :)
AC has halted flights to Italy...I'm sure the rest will follow.
hola. lol reply #30.
"I feel your pain/confusion. I am from U.S., leaving this Friday (3/13/20) for Cuba. As a healthy 68 year old woman, I think I'm gonna chance it. My only worry is getting back home in two weeks time- and what the state of the world will be by then. I hear Cuba's health industry is good."
"hola. what is our Canadian government doing to reduce the risks of a Canadian on a plane taking the virus to Cuba. Toronto airport, say for example? one would think that the international loco(i was only there once on my way to Cuba, loco) lineup at customs would be the number one spot in Canada for possibly spreading it, like many large airports in the world. My Canadian government just announced $1 billion, but it is for after people might get sick, that sounds out of whack, weird."
what's k doing on a non canadian plane? rofl carol e
"hola. reply #33 pamela, as some long time members here on TA say, take some of your own medical supplies. yah, i know, sounds weird. safe travels!"
I feel your confusion/determination/attitude Pam :) That American spirit should be the contagious one :)
@34...A billion Canadian eh :) Sounds like they know more than we do ? :) ?
"Completely understand how you are feeling, we are due to come to Cuba soon from the UK. We are monitoring the situation day by day but we know we could go into lock down as Italy has done at some point as cases keep on rising... Our current position is that unless we are advised against travel by the foreign office or our flights are cancelled we intend to go; obviously this would take account of it we were exposed to the virus or developed symptoms. I am concerned about ending up in quarantine in Cuba with 2 kids, and if that looks increasingly likely to happen we would reassess. We are fortunate on the one hand that our airline is offering a range of options if you choose to cancel and will fully refund if an area is advised against travel or we can't travel because of lock down. The unfortunate side to this would be that this airline has changed its route to Cuba after we travel so it will involve 2 stops and a 30 hour journey time so we wouldn't want to take up their rebook option; we have the option to take vouchers and book something else within 12 months but this would mean a different destination. In short, if this trip doesn't happen I don't see us making it to Cuba in the foreseeable and it's a real one-off bucket list trip for us. We are watching and waiting, trying to be patient, trying not to freak out. All the best whatever you decide."
"holala. yup kookoo, i just called the my provincial and federal Liberal Party. yup, kookoo, that they are droppin the ball at our airports. sad, to see and hear. no entiendo. and lo siento to say, it is kinda to late, but they gotta, one would think, pull the head outta the poop shoot. ps - lo siento, as i say, it is easier when one removes the ears first."
"Just had a text from my nephew, him and his wife got home last night from the Royalton CSM. He said everyone is starting to panic...whatever that means, and we should really think if we should go or not, right now."
Lori. Only you and your husband can decide for you.I would keep thinking your perfect room is waiting.
"I'm set to leave in 2 weeks... I personally want to go. The bigger question is whether the airports will remain open. For the life of me, I cant imagine Cuba shutting out tourists... but weirder things have happened.Anyone on the ground know what is being said with regards to the airport? Potential closure at all?Edited: 3:10 pm, March 11, 2020 "
That's a crazy butt true one gerropato :) You're kinda helping my Spanish btw :) Here's another butt crazy one...how about another World forum... we're all eventually in this :) Let's here how the rest of the world is coping/panicking :)
Just texted my nephew and asked him what it was like at the airport coming home...waiting.
"@42) Diva, my cat sitter just left, just made my nail appoint....I have to go."
I don’t think airports will close realistically at this stage - unless it gets a whole lot worse . Hopefully we will see that coming and plan accordingly
"Cat sitter booked here too, and nail appointment made."
We're so sync...lol
Cat sitter and nails booked here too! Is this like a protective talisman that will ensure the trip goes ahead???? ;)
"hola. lo siento, sorry to be. if i were yous i'd cut or chew thoughs nails as short as possible. lo siento."
I was feeling less panicked with all the cat and nail bookings :)
We are supposed to leave saturday and I too am freakig out and not sure what to do!! I dont think there is a right answer just follow your instincts? No idea...first vacay/honeymoon and ofcourse this happens.
Let’s see how these 3 cases will be dealt with https:/…
Well yes ... there is no Force Field around Cuba . It is inevitable. Johnny C
Is that Spanish what I think it is...and at a University...not good.
Well it looks like they are reporting cases.
"As others mentioned, Cuba is not immune to the virus. What’ll be interesting to watch is whether they take more extensive measures than everyone else to “prevent” it from spreading. I can’t see too many countries shutting down airports, but with Cuba, you just don’t know"
"All of a sudden, things aren't looking the greatest, have a feeling we won't be going until later in the year. It's a wait and see right now."
The next few weeks will tell the tale...could be very disappointing...better than very sickening I guess...damit!
"Update, regarding airport, no one was wearing masks, except on the exit..? Not much cleaning...flight was 5 hrs late, that's just great. Those from Italy and Poland were in a panic. Now for the resort info....food was terrible (they have been there before), and running out of food."
I’m totally freaking out. I’m supposed to leave in a month. I’m Cuban and I haven’t seen my family in 8 years and they haven’t met my daughter. I am worried about the all inclusive With so many people visiting from everywhere. I don’t know what to do
"I hate posting right after someone, sorry to take those moments Mike :) I see you understand Spanish more than I do :) This is not so funny anymore...major sports teams are banning fans and we're going to airports...?"
See what I mean :)
"I’m freaking out, I want to go get some sun... lol"
I am pretty well resigned to the fact we will have to cancel. We were to leave for a 2 week trip on March 31. We have 3 elderly parents and my wife works self employed in child care. I think during the next few weeks the dominoes are going to start to fall. We are weeks away from a very bad situation. My concern is when to cancel and if Sunwing will honour the cancellation insurance. It could wind up being like a “run on the bank” situation where they just close leaving customers hanging.
That's a tuff one grapes...but in your situation the right one :(
"It's too bad, we are probably also going to cancel, husband picks up things quite easily. After being in a hospital for a week in Mexico, he is starting to question about going.Edited: 7:11 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"We are booked to arrive on April 7th...I have been following the worlds actions and reactions towards this virus for weeks now. Last week I was 100% going. This morning when I woke up, I was down to about 80%. Then by this afternoon, things changed drastically! Who in their lifetime would have thought that Italy would completely SHUTDOWN? That being said, I have started to ask myself a few questions all starting with “what if”...will Canada shut down?...will I get stuck in Cuba, and for how long?...how would I handle being quarantined in a Cuban hospital, and for how long? ...could my husband and I be split up while there?...Heaven forbid that one of us dies there...what then?...My parents are elderly and would not know what to do if there is a regional quarantine in Canada...who would be able to help them if I couldn’t get back?...Our daughter is 30 weeks pregnant at home and may find herself in a bad situation here if all hell breaks loose...who will she get to help her and her other two children if we are stuck out of the country? I fortunately purchased Sunwings “no questions asked” cancelation insurance were we can cancel up to 3 hours prior to our flight. At this exact moment, I have my mind set at about 95% to cancel....BUT...I think we are still going to wait one more week to pull the trigger just in case. So disappointed on one hand, but absolutely devastated for each and every human being going through this WORLDWIDE. I’m almost feel like this is a bad dream because it is not ever anything that I thought about happening even 2 months ago."
"Cuba will still be there once this passes. It hurts to cancel but no sense being reckless. This is turning out to be a once in a lifetime event that you can’t ignore anymore. I am also over 60 and I have had Legionnaires Disease....back in 1994. I don’t want to go thru anything like that again.

I'm trying to be positive and test positive...its not looking good but I wanna go so bad...damit!
"Kind of sitting on the fence....you're supposed to be excited about a vacation...seems to be shifting, wondering if everything is going to be alright. There is always another time, maybe in a few months.....lots of decisions to make."
"Grape nut...the way I am looking at things now is to think of the worst case scenario happening...and then make it worse. Those are odds that are just not worth it for me on a VACATION that is supposed to be fun! I’m not having any fun at all waiting for something that is supposed to be pleasantly “looked forward to” and “an adventure”. I don’t want any experiences in Cuba to help me write a horror story. Just is not making sense to me. Others may find this type of event in their lives as a learning experience, but for me...this is not the type of life experience I need at 60 years old.Edited: 7:26 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"At this moment in time, I'm still going...I've got the back up bubble suits ready to pack :) Just trying to ease the painful but wise decision with my silly keyboard grapes :) Tough things/decisions like this have a way of working out for the better...we could all be doing the same :)"
"Cuba will be there in 6 months or so...for me, I feel it is in my best interest to just stay put and wait for better times. I know that I will feel awful on April 7th when I see the planes flying overhead going to all the beautiful places in the world, but I know they aren’t going anywhere and will wait for me at a later date!"
I feel for you people that are going to Cuba this month or next not an easy decision but health is so precious good luck with whatever you decided to do .US is talking about closing the boarders to Europeans like they did for China and we all know what Canada will do if this happens .
"Grapes...Sunwing, since we are the same...no cash refund (darn), a voucher for the full amount. If you have upgraded seats, non-refundable. BTW, they are being swamped right now with cancellations.Edited: 7:51 pm, March 11, 2020 "
Lori....we upgraded our seats on Sunwing...are you sure they will not recognize this as a credit on future flight with Sunwing?
Lori I did not know the seats were none refundable. Who knows maybe this time around they will change there rules this is a serious matter and I'm sure they would not want any bad publicity .Credit Cards companies they have insurance maybe it can cover for the upgrade for seats at least .
"If you’re under 60 years old, you have a better chance at winning the lottery than dying from corona. This is hysteria created by the news outlets. Corona is the “sexy” topic and it’s what gets people to click on links and open websites. Essentially, corona propaganda = $$. More people are dying every day in car accidents and suicides. If you’re canceling you’re trip because of health concerns, I assure you that the country you’re in is far more riskier than Cuba. As I mentioned before, my bigger concern is that this hysteria causes some type of airport shutdown and I simply can’t get home... the disease itself is no where on my radar of concerns, personally."
Non refundable elite plus seats Lori ?.? . What’s their explanation for that . ??They will just resell them to someone else .That seems unfair .Johnny C

"So, for those of you who decide to continue with your travel plans and head to Cuba in the next while … here are a few things that you might want to do:- Make sure that you bring everything that you might need for an extended stay – including MEDICATIONS. Phone your pharmacy and explain that you need an extended prescription, just in case.- Extend your medical coverage NOW. Phone your insurer and extend your coverage for at least 15 days after your anticipated return home. - Register with your country’s foreign affairs bureau so that you can be kept up to date on any changes in your home country that might affect your return travel.- Ensure that your employer knows that you are travelling internationally, and be ready to accept whatever restrictions they might place on you when you return to Canada. When you arrive in Cuba, and when you return to your home country PLEASE do not joke about the situation. Many people are (rightfully, imho) taking COVID-19 very seriously."
"And another thing … stop bitching and complaining about what Cuba is or isn’t doing to protect you. It’s YOUR choice to travel to a developing country during a pandemic. Put on your big boy’s/girl’s pants.Edited: 8:20 pm, March 11, 2020 "

"I TOTALLY understand people’s challenge and questioning about should they go or not. It’s not going to be the same answer for everybody, no question. We all have different levels of risk tolerance for a whole variety of reasons. And (take me Jesus!) I agree with the duck, “a holiday is the gravy on potatoes. be happy you got potatoes”. LOL"
"I have cancelled my trip. Terribly disappointed, but it feels like the only sensible decision."
Dundastraveller .....who were you booked with and please explain the procedure and how it went for refund/vouchers....
On a diet right now...maybe I'll have my gravey on potatoes later.
"We leave for Varadero on Saturday - at this point still planning on going as the country still appears to be safe from the virus. Leaving from Hamilton airport, so that makes me a bit more at ease. May decide to cancel plans to Havanna though."

"@95) for some reason, that ""e"", just jumped in there."
We're not going til Apr 4th - so we'll see what happens closer to that time - but not worried. Hand sanitizer and mini liquid soap to carry. Also flying out of Hamilton so lower risk there than Pearson. Not worried.

Lori M a ban on travel in one direction also means an effective ban on travel in the other direction. No airline is going to fly knowing they will have to return empty.

With our families, from children to elders. What do we do? Less than 6 weeks away and I believe the covid19 will continue to escalate. Cuba also announced today they have their first 2 confirmed cases. It’s a tough decision to make!"
Thanks Dundas... I am booked with Sunwing ...hopefully it will be as easy when I call tomorrow night.....still trying to wrap my head around all of this. Went out tonite and bought a lot of groceries as a precaution.
"My situation is a little different, as I am looking backwards at our Cuba trip and not forwards.We were a group of 10 people visiting a resort in Cayo Santa Maria from Jan 29-Feb 8th. We flew out of Toronto and were all in good health on arrival in Cuba. Two days later, one in our group fell ill with runny nose, cough, fever and chills, fatigue and no appetite. Next day, her husband was sick with similar symptoms. Then it hit me - I spent two days in my room in bed, just drinking water as I had absolutely no appetite. By the end of our 9 day trip, 6 of our 10 had fallen ill. We were all in the same bungalow and at first thought it might be mold in the A/C causing our symptoms - or maybe we picked up the flu.It took at least two weeks after we returned home before the coughing subsided, our appetite returned and we didn't feel ""off"".So now fast forward to today, a month later and the rapid spread and panic over Covid-19. We wonder if perhaps that is what we all had a month ago. The good news, is that we have all recovered and are on the mend. But we all were very very sick. I don't believe we picked this up in Cuba. It had to be on the plane heading down from Toronto, as it took two days before the first person showed symptoms.I was hesitant to post this message, but wanted to share our recent experience. I always bring liquid hand soap on my travels and wash my hands as often as I do at home. I bring a travel mug and my own straw. But I think the planes we travel on are a germ fest and do not get cleaned or sanitized in between flights enough to stop the transmission of this type of illness."

Hola @108I would also have pulled the pin....take care
We have after much discussion cancelled out trip this week. Had the Sunwing worry free package and after a simple phone call to give our booking number and our cancellation request we have a travel voucher in the mail for the entire amt minus the cost of the insurance . This by the way included the upgraded seat package and the food ordered on the plane. We will rebook when the pandemic has subsided and most certainly will purchase that insurance package again

"It would be far too easy to just say F-it and go and do the 2 week vacay but it comes down to what your values are really about. 2 weeks on the beach reading a good book and playing in the water or ....doing the right thing.i value this community I think I belong to...the Cuban forum....I hope all you folk whom I have had the honour of glimpsing into your lives for these past 10 years.....I hope you stay aware, informed .....and be careful out there in the coming weeks."
Three cases confirmed Monday in Cuba. We are supposed to leave March 21st from Edmonton to Varadero. I'm planning on going just hoping Cuba does not stop flights from coming in. Flights from Europe are being stopped in certain countries now.
Geez.... no chance to watch the link. If that is hmmmm...sorry for the Shade lol. Walking backwards here....
Not sure if I mentioned this on another thread.... in 1994 I somehow contracted Legionaires Disease...the brits have health training on it right Diva? Anyways... until then I thought pneumonia was a bad cold. Getting legionella in both lungs pretty well shut me down for 3-4 months. I don’t want to go thru anything like that again nor expose anyone to that. So...I actually may be comprised...I really do not know.
"#122...Thank you for your Sunwing trip Cancellation information. We will be following suit tomorrow. We too purchased the same insurance and prepaid seat selection at the time of arranging our trip 3 months ago, and I was not quite sure what I would be required to do or receive back from Sunwing."

I'm going in 12 days too from Australia.My only worry is if they ban flights from Oz to America as we are transitting through LA.My friend and I are feel Cuba would be safer than many other countries to travel to right now.

"Best case, this plays out like Y2K: after a massive containment effort, the worst-case scenario doesn't happen.The naysayers say ""see? it was no big deal!""Everybody else says ""see? extreme measures worked!""Worst case, in a few weeks the US, Canada and most of the EU look like Italy today. At least I hope that's the worst case."
"I was reading an article the other day that referenced health officials predictions for Canada stating that it has been determined that up to 70% of the Canadian population will inevitably contract the coronavirus. And that's regardless of measures taken to try to thwart it's spread too. We'll see, but I think everyone should try to protect the elderly first. That's where the focus should be... the rest of us will likely have to ride it out and survive.Terry"
"""up to 70% of the Canadian population will inevitably contract the coronavirus. And that's regardless of measures taken to try to thwart it's spread too.""This is why ""flattening the curve"" is important. That means doing what we can to slow the spread so that hospitals aren't walloped all at once, as in parts of Italy. I dearly hope I'm wrong, but I think it's too late to avoid that in North America."
Cancelled our March31 trip this morning.
"Grapes....did you have upgraded seats, if so, did you get a voucher for that also."
"Should one cancel vacation travel as an altruistic response to a pandemic and eliminate unnecessary travel or out of personal fear of contact with strangers?Had my next trip been scheduled now, I think I would venture out. Small airport, direct to Cuba and back. I'm fit, can afford any additional imposed time away or at home. Understand basic viral spread and sensible precautions. My parameters seem selfish when I list them?"
"Since it's past the 14day mark Sunwing won't refund me my $4k if I cancel so I'm going - leaving on the 23rd. Blame Sunwing if I bring that back I spose. I'm more worried about being stuck there an additional 14 days, but I won't bankrupt because of it."
Lori....I will know soon hopefully what I get back.
"The virus is much more concerning as per the newest data. Stay home.Coronavirus can remain in air for 3 hours, live on plastic for days, new study sayshttps://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-l…"
"@157, not necessarily selfish but maybe a bit naive? This thing spreads about as easily as cold or flu, (almost?) no one is immune, there can be a long asymptomatic period, it has a relatively high mortality rate especially for those 60+, and the Cuban population skews old. So even with ""sensible precautions"" it's possible to spread it around quite easily. Spreading it at home is bad enough, spreading it in Cuba is potentially even worse. I also suspect that those who choose to travel in the coming weeks are going to find life on the ground in Cuba harder than usual, both on-resort and off."
"Grapes, just cancelled, my TA put in the upgraded seats....not sure if that will be in the voucher. Very disappointed, but will go in a few months...or in two week...it's a wait and see.Edited: 11:58 am, March 12, 2020 "

"It all comes down to this....if you want to still go...go, if you cancel and rebook later...your choice."
"hola. reply #168, because maybe the death rate is 160% greater than the common flu. ps - the 160% rate is my calculation because of what they say, they say flu death rate .1% they say Corona 3% and i think that number will climb because of the lack of medical treatments as the numbers possibly rise. and i still stick to the 6% world wide death rate."
"lol Mikethe CDC calls it the 2018–2019 influenza season. What would you like me to do?Here... I'll divide it by 12 for you:2,958,333 cases of the flu per month2,850 deaths per monthCompare that to the Coronavirus stats which arent month to month, but as a whole."
"The stats don't tell you a great deal about travel risks right now as we anticipate the number of exposed carriers of the virus is vastly higher than the number of confirmed cases. And we know that what we know about any given location may be very different in 24 hours. And of course it isn't really a question of the risk to any individual but rather of how many people a given individual may unwittingly spread the virus to. If I'm exposed and become a carrier in an airport, I can infect a great many people before I know I have contracted the virus. And some of those people may die. It is at this point socially responsible to restrict exposure to large groups of people as much as possible."

Professional Leagues iof soccer n Europe are shutting down the NBA along with MLS are doing the same and the NHL is thinking about doing the same .Are they doing this because it's only a little Virus as some of you may think better to do something now then becoming the next Italy in the next couple of weeks .When I read stories from Italy and doctors have to decide who they are going to save and who is going to die then I guess if will not be a problem for me to listen to the Gouvernment if they say I should not travel and will just stay home .
All the UK government are doing is to tell us to stay at home if we have the symptoms.Why on earth are they not taking more decisive action. They will have to eventually. They are trying to push it back to the summer saying things will improve when the weather improves.I am FUMING.
"Hi,Ken, I and others will know your personal circumstances, you old fart and we wish you well over the coming months during this pandemic. You say that the UK government is doing nothing but rushing around like a headless chicken will not help.Those in the vulnerable groups should heed the advice given to lower the percentage or statistical probability of contacting this virus. We don't know everything about it but surely these simple measures will alleviate pressures on medical establishments.The somber figures that will most probably affect everyone are worrying but please focus your anger on staying fit and well and not on something we cannot change.You keep fit and keep yourself warm.

"I didn't buy cancellation either Sunwing says those who booked before March 4th have up to 5 days prior to our trip to make a free change - as long as we book it to travel before Oct 31st for same resort etc. Unfortunately, those who booked after March 4th have to do this 14 days prior."
"Well, on the lighter side here's part of Sunwing's promise...Cleaning: The resorts that we partner with have also implemented proactive and precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

"hola. reply #190. Sunwing's promise. do they know what a promise is. how many of Sunwing's 'ceo-s' would go on a holiday to one of their resorts in Cuba today, tomorrow or in the near future? Sunwing should of never made that promise and Sunwing should remove that promise. it isn't a promise."

"I can’t say this for certain, but I don’t think Canada can technically leave you stranded on Cuba. your visa expires eventually and you’re a Canadian citizen with a right to come back to your country. Even if a specific airline closes, I’d try and find an alternative (even with a stop, if required). I believe Canada flew people back from China in the midst of a full out outbreak over there.... Cuba has a long way to go as of today to reach that stage"
"hola. and sorry to type this, Canada might be having enough problems at home to be dealing with and might not have the energy or resources to deal with the ones who left home to go on a holiday while they state there is a world wide pandemic going on."
Cuba is not on the list of countries with an advisory. They should help you home.
f 50 ·The was a video on global news tonight by a doctor talking about March break and thousands heading south - saying that risk was low to Canadians depending on where you are traveling of course - and they mentioned places like Mexico and Cuba are very low as they have less than Canada . I recorded it - but can’t post obv.

"they are still letting people from Italy into Cuba, 3 people diagnosed yesterday...they should keep them in their country if they are at risk. its not Canadian people that will bring it in, but those from other countries"
BC government is like Trump. They make this announcement with no clarification!!? What about people out of Canada now? Do they have to quarantine 14 days? How would their work know they were overseas. Is customs going to ask where you work and phone them? Will your employer have to pay you for 14 days if you go?Will airlines have to refund? They only recommended you don't go they didn't ban travel.This is ridiculous.
"I see the panic is alive and well :) Just because the entire world is panicking...we should try and remember that message we never wanted to live...""in a panic situation remain calm"" What!? :)"
Post 206.You are talking crap.If you know the magic tablet that stops canadians taking it in then let the rest of the world know.
Speaking of panicking...I think all non-important air traffic should be put on hold for 2 weeks. We just keep flying around with this virus...it flies pretty good on it's own :) Probably won't happen cause it's my idea...but its the only way to at least contain it at home...next you see who has it and put them away for a while until they die or get better.
My aunt works at the airport in moncton. This morning sunwing still had 173 passengers and airtransat had 183. Still lots going it seems.
"This week will be last chance, I think."
"Yes, there are lots still flying...my DIL and two grandchildren are flying from Flint MI to Florida today...I'm not happy."
"@213 Is it your opinion that flights from Canada will be stopped after March Break? We are scheduled to fly Air Transit from Hamilton to Cayo Coco April 5th, we have no insurance and at this point are really thinking we will not travel, flight cancellation would probably be the best for us!"
"gator, I'm watching the situation and all of my neighbors and friends who have cancelled or will cancel in the next week or so. Every one of them has cancelled or is cancelling. Timing is everything with cancellations and getting coupons or cash.Opinion? We all have those. Mine is that air traffic will stop for a while and I don't want to be stuck in quarantine anywhere but at home.Whether that's enough to get a credit card charge reversed? Probably not."
I'm a world travelor 30 plus years. The decision is not about whether one will survive the illness (very likely). Its about the geopolitical situation whereby travel from Cuba is very likely to be shut down in a heartbeat. Stay home.
"Thank you Spunky, I respect your opinion, even if we lose our $$$ for the trip it is making less and less sense to travel!"

#217 I tend to agree. The conditions on the AI resort are comparable with the ones on the Cruise Ship. All people going to the same buffet. It takes just one ill person to start it.
"Some people continue to down play the reactions by governments and organizations as if the problem is not serious and everyone is over reacting. The spread of the virus in countries like China, South Korea and Italy would have been far worse, actually unimaginable, if they had just treated it like the seasonal flu. The, what seem to be, extreme measures that they are taking are necessary to stop the spread. If you think the number of cases in Canada is low and nothing to worry about, it's because it's just starting over here. All of the precautions that are now being taken like the cancellation of sports and entertainment events and the closing of schools is a logical step to keeping this virus from getting out of control.Remember there is no vaccine for this and the death rate from contracting the disease is 3.5% while the seasonal flu is 0.1%. So the people who continue to act as if nothing is wrong are only contributing to the potential problem, as they will continue to act selfishly without concern for others.Edited: 10:10 am, March 13, 2020 "

"@225, if it was I doubt we would have this worldwide spread. Ebola tends to terminate its carriers rather quickly. This virus hides itself until the victim has spread it around, so it infects more people, although with a lesser mortality percentage, but like the flu, a low percentage adds up when you have many people infected.Also, Ebola patients are not infectious until they display symptoms. And it doesn't spread through the air.Edited: 10:29 am, March 13, 2020 "
Talking about panicking i just came from a grocery store in Montreal and i think many people are taking this very seriously .Usually on Friday morning its very quiet not today it was worse then boxing day and shelves are getting empty fast never saw anything like this .Soon i guess they will be doing what they do in Cuba and that is make people wait in line hope not but i would not bet on it .Just can imagine what is going to happen if they shut everything down like they did in Italy .For those from the other Provinces are you guys getting the same feeling or its business as usual .
"@223, good post. I would add that the people who are downplaying this, and especially those whose attitude is ""I'm young and healthy, I'll survive"" are ignoring at least three important points:1. What about those who are highly vulnerable? Thanks for not caring about them, champ. 2. Even young, healthy people may develop a severe case and potentially suffer permanent lung damage. Ask some SARS survivors, it ain't pretty.3. The cases of Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and China (after the initial outbreak) show that large-scale testing & tracing is a highly effective anti-epidemic measure, because it identifies asymptomatic and mild cases, which can then be quarantined. Without widespread testing, we get reassuringly low numbers while unaware virus-carriers go on about their business. Once community spread goes on for a while, numbers spike uncontrollably and you wind up having to quarantine almost everyone. Guess what is not being done in the US and Canada?"

"#241 don't forget that if the hospitals are treating more patients than their capacity, which in reality is probably already there even without Corona, everyone with any type of illness will be impacted and will probably receive much less care. This is not even counting the fact that health care professionals will also be getting ill so even less capacity in the health care system than now. Newly retired health care professionals are an option but how many will be willing to put themselves in harm's way especially when they are in an older age group where the illness is higher risk."

"His Nibs is very anxious about Covid-19, and concerned about the impact that it is having on so many people. I try to remind him that everybody isn’t in the same proverbial boat, and that people’s decision to travel or not is their own personal choice (as long as the flights are operating). But, along with the right to travel goes the possibility that things might change over the next few days or the next few weeks that might impact anyone travelling. Your vacation might be shortened or might be longer than expected. Canada has the right to impose restrictions on you when you return home. You might be quarantined, and there is no knowing at this time if that could be a “self-quarantine”, or if you might be mandated to spend time at a military base (for example).Also, if you decide to travel and if you encounter any challenges in Cuba such as loss of passport or wallet or an accident of any type whatever, there might be reduced staff at the consulates and embassy to assist you.These are some things that people must consider if they choose to travel. On the other hand, if you decide not to travel, you might not have access to any cancellation insurance, so you might be out big bucks. Santiago is shaking his head. He finds it very stressful, and is offering an afternoon of free “special” churros. Wash your hands first though.Edited: 12:49 pm, March 13, 2020 "

I wonder what the announcement by Canada’s chief Public Health Officer about cancelling all but essential travel outside of Canada will have on the validity of travel medical insurance ?Lenny
And who is to decide what is essential travel ? For instance I have to go soon as I have a very close friend who is not well. We all need to see each other before it is too late.
"HolaThe door is slowing closing on my next trip in a few weeks time. This one is out of TO. If anything were to change in that two week trip, we could get quarantined(like mad) stated, in Ontario for a few weeks...not liking that idea at all...would be bad enough here in B.C.We were already planning to do the self lockdown at home …. but perhaps a mandated one, not liking the sounds of that...I do not need another 2 week AI...lol.One thing, not boring these days...cheers."
Diva...you and your friends have to do what you should do essentially :)rrrichar :) The reason we cancelled was the thought of being quarantined in Cuba...home is where the quarantine is :)
"Holabeing quarantine in cuba, if we had no flue....perhaps they would put us on a section of beach with lots of beer& cigars...now that would be ok.Or say mandated on a military base in Ontario....yikes.Think I will work on my golf early at home...cheers."
That 1/2 hour per day on the beach would be okay I guess :) Ya lets think spring and golf at this point :) We can always binge vacation when things are good again :) I've been thinking about hitting some balls at the indoor range out here...I prefer working on the sand game in Cuba mind you :)
Look at this guy trying to be funny and guess what he got he tested positive 48 hour later to this Virus .https:/…
"gat0, here's what it's like here....I don't know...things are crazy, just returned from our usual Friday grocery shopping. First we hit Walmart, to pick up a few items....on the way in, this guy had a cart full of chicken, never seen anything like it, store was packed, carts piled high, it would have taken forever to check out...we didn't stay. Coffee break, why, we didn't do anything yet, off to the mall, it's between Walmart and grocery store. This not a prejudice comment....only ones there wearing masks were Chinese students..lots, maybe they're the smart ones,..who knows. Next stop grocery store...did I say crazy, shelves were getting empty, not one pkg. TP to be found. Bread just about gone, one person had so much rice, where do you put all that. People in front of us, had enough noodles to last a year...this was one stupid day."
"All the bravado from some people reminds me of ""whistling past the graveyard"". Or maybe just winding people up.....As far as the panic buying goes, monkey see, monkey do. But then you see the empty shelves and if they get restocked, you're the monkey!"
"@233) you spent $1500 on canned goods, that's a lot of cans."

"hola. reply #271, you might look back and think, maybe this was not one stupid day the way people were buying. i Hope Not! notice lately the media isn't talking about Italy that much. kinda eerie, but entiendo, maybe the less we see what is actually happening, reality, the less panic there will be. less panic, is bueno! reality."
"Funny, I was thinking the same thing...Costco is packed wall to wall people.....so much for not wanting to be in contact with anyone."
"@276) the only thing I'm watching is the stock market....that's my priority right now, not filing up my pantry....we have lots of soup...lol"
"hola. lol! thank you for the lol Lori! yup, that must be me. yup, $1,200(worth $1,600 easily because of sale prices) canned goods, mucho salmon and beans, pasta, rice etc etc . and checking expiry dates, bueno. $300 pet food and cat litter. like i told the neighbors and friends, i can live off of squirrel meat and oak bark tea, 90% of those items of food is for my family :) yup, i know poco loco, loco poco! no problema. my thinkin was that there is a 1% chance. es vida for me!"
"@279) yep, that makes sense to me."
gerropato It depends were you read .This is from a Fench newspaper in Montreal ….In the last 24 hours 250 people have died in Italy from the Virus for a total of 1266 and things are not getting any better .They also have another 1328 in intensive care which is not good at all .
"ps - don't throw out your old underwear, but if you do save the elasticated waistband, might need that elasticated part for home made masks. true. might."
"ps - there has been a few times that i WANTED! to YELL as loud as i could 2 words, while in a grocery store or store parking lot and that was a week and 2 weeks ago. my two perras are getting use to the word f_c_in, but still don't like the word f_c_ :)"
"Oh, gerropato, hola :) I think we all got that one...might have to tie a knot or two :) Our world is weird right now...not just the mask thing :) I mean its like a movie or is it just the latest Sativa strain :) I'm finding it easy to stay calm mind you :))"
Basically the same response @284 to @283 as well as the original 282 :)
"Want to get our usual TP buy, nephew said, we have to come to Costco early, because 1100 were waiting to get in today...sold out in 20 minutes. Think I'll just go to the drugstore.Edited: 4:19 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"@284 Indica works well too! I just went out and stocked up on beer and wine, got my bike repaired as that may be my main form of exercise in the next little while as I anticipate the hockey rinks will be closed soon and the snow has all melted here!"
"Not sure of the ethics of this, but this couple acted fast on the bulk buying and made a fortune! https:/… BTW Santiago are bidding on a contract to sell churros to military messes.where quarantined tourists are housed. We also hear the messes have cheap beer. A win win!Edited: 4:56 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Wondering about the motivation to hoard TP. I don't think COVID is a GI event, is it?"
"@290, maybe it's scaring the sh*t out of them??"
The Canadian government is restricting the number of airports that will be accepting international flights. Flying out of Moncton may end up getting you a return flight to Halifax or Montreal.
@287...I thought Sativa was the motivator :)
"My family and I are scheduled to leave on the 17th of March to Cayo Santa Maria, because of the reported confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Cuba within last two days, we have been trying to contact Manual Life,itravel2000, and Red Label Vacations to make changes to our reservation through out the entire day with out success. So, we end up sending an email to covid-19@redlabelvacations.com. We hope they will reply and help us prior to our departure date. We have been their customer since 2002."
"@296) do they have one of those call back features. Yesterday I had a call into Tugo, in the morning, hit that callback, that says you're in callback order....took until near 11pm for them to call."
Which company did they book you with?Here's a list of the policies from Canadian operators:https:/…Language choice is in upper right
"Hola Kelp T @296Now that the Canadian government has issued a travel advisory for all non-essential travel outside of Canada for an indefinite period of time, it is a whole different ball game with respect to travel insurances. Here's what I found posted on Pacific Blue Cross - and I suspect it will be similar for other insurance companies as well:Does my travel insurance cover me for emergency medical care if I visit a country where COVID-19 has been detected?Yes and no.Your travel insurance covers the type of emergency medical care you might need for a COVID-19 infection, but it is very important to note that you are not covered for expenses incurred for a medical condition resulting from an infectious disease or illness for which there is a travel advisory or health warning by the Canadian government and published or broadcast in the media prior to the your departure date.That's the final nail in the coffin for our trip...Cheers"
OK it is Friday the 13......still laughing...your post was great..cheers.
"rrrichar post 299...did u book thru SUNWING? If so, will u be re-imbursed to ur credit card the full price? Or do u need to go thru the cancellation insurance?"
"Kelp T.I too spent hours trying to contact Itravel2000. Finally after 2 hours of hold time, got through to an agent. We booked thru itravel and were sold an AirCanada Vacation package to Verarero. Air Canada posted on aircanadavacations that as of March 11 you can make a one time rebooking of your vacation due to the Covid-19 outbreak. You must rebook before Dec31st 2020. They gave me an email address to communicate to referencing my booking number. I am awaiting a response. Said could take 24hours for that.Just too risky for me to get stuck down there, or getting exposed to it and getting stuck there, or having to self isolate here upon my return. Who knows what other restrictions might happen in the next week."
"If you have S/W worry free cancellation insurance you still won’t get a refund to your CC but can rebook up until 1 year. If not you may rebook up until October 31/20. I have Blue Cross which is likely not going to cover us now but may still go in April if possible and buy Asistur online. Not overly concerned about canceling as I have S/W no worry for the land only and W/J plus for the flight so can do what I want. LennyEdited: 7:28 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Hola Mike @ 302Our vacation package is with WestJet Vacations. Based on past experience with WestJet, when it was WestJet that cancelled (Hurricane Irma), we were able to receive a full refund to the cc used in the booking transaction. Did not have to go through Travel Insurance in that case as WestJet did the refund.Was a different story if we wanted to cancel first - then it was option to rebook or get WestJet dollars.After Hurricane Irma, I believe Sunwing, and other tour operators, refunded travelers for the full amount back to their cc after Sunwing cancelled the flights - or they should have at least been given that as an option.Our trip is scheduled for 3 weeks from today. I will wait to hear from WestJet if they are cancelling the flight and package. If they don't, then I will make a claim through the annual travel insurance plan I have with Pacific Blue Cross that includes cancellation now that the travel advisory has been issued.Tour operators and insurance companies must be crazy busy right now...CheersEdited: 7:37 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"t/y rrrr. You've been around the block a few times or more. Great experience for us travelers when things go sour. Where were u headed in 3 weeks, PCSM maybe?"
"Hola MikeWas booked this time for 2 weeks at MCSM. Was there for a week in January - glad to have had that trip now, lol!Funny thing is, the last time we booked for a 2 week vacation at MCSM, it was with WestJet also....the one that got cancelled because of Irma. Not sure now if the jinx is because I booked WestJet, or MCSM, or MCSM for 2 weeks instead of 1.....lol! Cheers"
Been to MCSM back in 2010. Ricky still the beach guy there?
"I work on the waterfront here in Vancouver . Longshoreman Port of Vancouver .We have just been told ( official memo ) that anyone returning from overseas including the U.S will not be allowed to return to work until after 14 days of isolation .This is big . The world is going bloody crazy .The plot thickens Johnny CEdited: 8:02 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Thank you for your reply.It is a Sunwing vacation package and we booked through itravel2000 with All-Inclusive insurance from Manulife Global All-Inclusive Policy.The problem here for us is that none of them pick up their phone so we can make changes to our travel plan. Hopefully itravel2000 received our email and able to help us in time.Cheers.
KracyJoeDivolaThank you for letting me know I am not alone in this situation. My concern of the unpredictability with quarantine location and duration spoils my family vacation.Good luck to those who choose to go.Cheers.
My flight left today at 420pm from toronto to holguin. It was a 1 week all inclusive to Brisas Guardalavaca. My wife and I backed out last minute when the Canadian government announced the non essential travel advisory earlier today.We contacted selloffvacations and after many attempts we got through but due to the departure time of the flight being so close they could not move my date or give any sort of credit. We are obviously heartbroken and not sure what else to do. I put in a claim with my cibc aventura visa card because they have some sort of trip cancellation but I'm not sure if they will help.
"Live from my friend in Havana:Estoy mirando el noticiero de la Tv dice que están cerrados todos los teatros y todos los lugares bailables en cuba tanto casas de músicas, bares o lugares donde haya aglomeraciones de personas hasta nuevo aviso decido a las dolencias de la enfermedad del coronavirus y prevención English version:Bars, clubs, and major gathering spots are closed until further notice"
"Finally Victoria of itravel2000 picked up the phone and asked me to email her my request to postpone my trip or refund my payment. I was suppose to receive a confirmation within 24 hrs, else call back for another long day........."
Kelp T...what email address did they give to you to cancel. I spent hours on hold and had to finally give up. I travel needs to get more callers on to help us.
I find it strange that Canadians are cancelling their trips to Cuba because of Coronavirus.Cuba has 3 cases of CoronavirusCanada has 196 cases with only 3X the population of Cuba.
"I’m heading to Varadero on March 19th from YYZ. You have to live your life but remain vigilant and sanitary. 3 cases in Havana today from Italian tourists , other than that nothing. Just be smart but go. If people cancel you will have the plane and hotel to yourself . Not bad! Plus, Cuba is on the leading edge of the preventative medicines for the virus and their medical system is ready . Worry not. Go. See you there!"
"hola. #317, i find it strange that you find it strange that Canadians are cancelling their trips to Cuba. Maybe you have never been to Canada, but you have been to Cuba. ps - there is more to life than a holiday and there are some people with loved ones at home. strange?"
"Hello everyone, I totally feel the pain of the people who booked lots of months ago their vacations and now they are faced with this situation. We were once in the situation a few years back when we couldn’t go in our vacation and we had to rebook for a later time because of work related matters and it almost broke my heart(it was a last minute thing and I thought that everything was just against us). I was almost booking a trip to Europe to be with my father for Easter, when they started to show what is going on in Italy and all over Europe. So, we took a step back and said, no, we can’t go, no matter how much we want to be with my dad. What I don’t understand is why nobody is thinking or at least asking themselves this: what are the repercussions in a long term if you get sick with this virus. Personally, I wouldn’t want to be far away from home when something like this happens because you don’t know how your body reacts to the virus. We are all very different individuals, so there is no way to say how each of us will react to this virus, based on each person’s immune system, each we’ll react differently. There is nothing that they know for sure, “we are on an uncharted territory” the WHO is telling us for months, and maybe we should start to understand what that really means. I don’t want to panic anyone or anything like this, but I think that we should all analyze carefully the situation and despite all the negativity around us to try to stay as positive as we can. We will pass this too, but we must be smart about it! Going back to the people that have booked their trip months ago and waiting for a long time for their well-deserved vacation, it is a really sad moment because you really need to decide if you should get going with that well deserved vacation and risk your health or just try to rebook maybe? Based on what the Canadian officials said all day today “all non-essential travel outside Canada should be postponed or canceled”, so why should you take that big risk on you and your family. I know that it is easier to say than to do it, but just try to rebook and think that you’ll have a blast going in loots of vacations to come. Ba safe and stay healthy!"
"hola. worldometers, says Cuba plus 1, now 4 cases. true number? nobody here on TA knows if the plus 1 is true."
hola. rumor has it the plus 1 is Santi Spiritus.
"Not sure where the +1 info came from or where the world meter website gets their infoMinister of Public Health says no new cases: cubadebate.cu/noticias/….XmxfRCRE0lQThis virus will surely get around. My guess is that it will become part of our everyday lives — no different than how the common flu is. Some will catch it some years and some won’t... we’ll have more serious cases at times and others that probably are so mild they won’t even be reported. Not meaning to downplay the circumstances here, but the hysteria seems a bit much in comparison to what occurs on a daily basis within our planet and doesn’t get reported.Edited: 12:42 am, March 14, 2020 "

confirmed 4th case cubanews.acn.cu/cuba/10440-cuba-fourth-case-…
"Hola@ 325, 326, & 327 nobody here on TA knows.Knows what? Seems some people here on TA only want to believe what a very few people say about situations in Cuba, as being true. So why should anyone else bother to post anything? Seems I can say what my few trusted friends are telling me about what is happening where they are, in the moment, where they live in Cuba - but it won't really be true unless someone else, well known on this forum says it is so. I could say that a message my wife received tonight from a friend of over 13 years, mentions a Cuban man from Santa Clara who is now known to have the virus, was in contact with a teacher from the school where she works, and her child attends, during the same period. Child currently has fever (not so unusual in normal situations), but now there is fear because he was in the same place as someone who was infected. Same friend tells us it is a probably a good idea we don't travel to Cuba now.Many may not believe this unless there is a hyperlink attached to an article - or unless some other more well known/trusted forum contributor agrees - even without the hyperlink, lol.Have heard there are rumours of a tourist testing positive on a resort - but that is really only a rumour until it is confirmed. Cuba is a small place. With a lot of people - and it is peak tourist time with tourists from many parts all over the globe. Personally, I don't think the presence of the virus is necessarily a reason to panic, but to believe that there are only 3 or 4 positive cases in all of Cuba because that is what is being reported, is probably like believing in the tooth fairy.My opinion, but let's get real...Cheers"
"I have had two long chats tonight with people I have known for over 25 years.I trust them on everything they day.One has said a case if close by, they did not say where ,and because a member of the family has been very ill with an unrelated condition they are closing their business to protect them .The other friend has said a case near Santa Clara has been talked about.Their reaction is ""it is hard for us now we can not even hug or great our friends with kisses"".Do not know how my comments will help the talk here , I just thought it was interesting how two people are reacting."
"Thanks 331 & 332...things are about to explode in Cuba...I wonder if you're both talking about the same person in Santa Clara? Yes Diva, Cubans love to say hello with a hug and kiss, the perfect way to spread a virus...cancelling was indeed the right thing to do. Unfortunately everyone has to suffer for a bit, especially if your a sports fan :)"
"I have just been sent this, interesting, although 4 confirmed cases many in isolation including tourists. Wish I could speak fluent Spanish to watch the video but I can translate the written.https:/…"
"Oh boy, not looking good. Cuba needs to panic now and shut down :) Nobodies going anyway. My biggest fear was quarantined in Cuba...it's happening!"
Post. 335. What a load of crap you write.Just because some have cancelled that by no means nobody is going.
"Okay, it's not quite a load yet Diva but it's gonna be :) April will be like August in Cuba tourist wise...of course there will be some crazy ones going :) The numbers of infected will rise in Cuba as sure as the sun does."
Well so now you are saying I am crazy because we are going.No not crazy just thinking why not.
"That's precisely the way crazy people think Diva :) Brave, careless, daring, and stupid also come to mind :) I wish you all the luck you're gonna need Diva...some live reporting when you're in the hot zone would be nice :)"
"Larry, your demeaning harassment of anyone who doesn’t share your opinion is really not called for. Diva and others have undoubtedly considered the pros and cons of travelling at this time and have made their choices. Maybe it’s time for YOU to take a vacation and step away from your keyboard."

"I got an email late last night from my travel agent saying that the health insurance for most Canadians will now not cover COVID-19 and steps on how to cancel our vacation. Any thoughts of going now are stopped as can’t afford to go if not covered, plus I feel morally it’s not really the right thing to travel at present. The Canadian government has put tremendous pressure on travelling. Many provinces and work places have mandatory quarantine on return from any international travel. I know lots that are cancelling because of that. My travel agent said don’t call but email back as the phone lines to them and Hola Sun are jammed.Edited: 7:41 am, March 14, 2020 "
"You can get C19 in Canada or Cuba. The biggest risks seems to be 1) that borders get shut down and/or 2) you end up quarantined in a foreign country where it would probably be on your own dime. 3) Your medical insurance may not cover any expenses if you do get C19. Insurance companies may/will invoke the Act of God clause and not cover you. 4) You may be required to self-isolate in Canada when you get back, or heaven forbid, put in a military base for 2 weeks. 5) At least for Canada, you may not fly back to your original destination if it is not a designated entry point. However, I suspect your carrier would have to eventually get you back home although it may be a day or more later than initially planned. Don't forget people are doing less travelling within Canada and internal flights will be reduced too.There were two travel experts on CBC News channel last night and one question they answered was ""My parents are on an extended trip to Cuba. Should I tell them to return home immediately? "" The response was ""Yes, recommend they come home immediately."" I believe their response was from the potential border (either Canada or Cuba) shutdowns than anything to do with C19.Edited: 8:02 am, March 14, 2020 "

As predicted long ago Larry is slowly reverting to his real persona and we all know what that means. Travel to anywhere right now especially Cuba may not be what you want to do but as previously stated there’s no justification to harass others over their choice. It would be interesting to see once you get turfed again Larry if they let you back again ??Lenny
"Had not yet purchased medical insurance - this was on the site for Cumis ""Travel insurance is intended to cover losses arising from sudden and unforeseeable circumstances. Any claims resulting from events known to you when purchasing your insurance are not covered.""So I'm guessing if I go and get Covid19 I'm screwed!"

"To give you an alternative view:My flight is on March 23rd to Havana, and unless they cancel the flights, I’m going. As a personal decision — and as a young, healthy individual, the minuscule risk at this time is not warranting me to cancel the trip. In fact, I’ll probably feel safer in Cuba than in Canada (less chance of catching it on a per cases bases, right now). Borders won’t be shut down and regardless, Canada isn’t going to be leaving anyone stranded anywhere. Everyone is to make their own decision — for me, the statistics speak for themselves"
"Not only are you up the proverbial creek if you actually get Covid-19, but you wouldn’t be covered for any expenses related to an extended stay in Cuba, or of being rerouted to another airport on your return to Canada, or of being in isolation for 15 days after your return so you couldn’t go to work, etc."
"#349 OMG Diva I have just spat my lunch all over my screen, biggest laugh I have had for quite a while lol, gotta luv ya x"
"Hyru The Canadian government is recommending that Canadians avoid all non-essential international travel - for the health of the population. It doesn’t matter that you are young and healthy. You can pick up the virus on a plane, in an airport and bring it home and infect your community. It’s not just about you. Please, get informed.Edited: 9:17 am, March 14, 2020 "

"I'll put this out for discussion. The Government statement says ""recommendation"" no where does it say mandatory. It also uses ""non-essential"" but gives no terms of what that statement actually is defined as. Basically it is a very broad statement with no definitive meaning."
"I’m well aware of what the Canadian government is indicating. But at one point or another, everyone will make their own decisions. Some will take their risks on a half empty airplane and an island with 4 cases. Others will go line up at Costco with 3000 other people and make it seem like that’s fine because the Canadian government hasn’t said otherwise.No one wants this illness and no one wants to be spreading it within their community. But as I said previously, statistically speaking, I personally feel safer in Cuba vs Canada. It’s not as if we’re flying into the epicenter of this virus. Canada has 40 times the cases of Cuba and I’m watching these sheep go shoulder to shoulder trying to buy toilet paper. Give me a break"
"Our group of 3 couples is booked for Cayo Coco in early April out of Hamilton, the wives are mostly saying they don't want to go whilst us guys have been taking a wait and see attitude! Every day it looks less and less likely we will go with the Canadian Government's travel advisory and more reported cases, I wouldn't be surprised if the flight is cancelled which will make the final decision for us!"
"For cripe’s sake, give it a break Kelly. There is no need for name-calling just because someone doesn’t share your opinion.And ... please stop deleting his posts. It's good for people to see the utter lack of compassion that he has."
"Re number 356: And so what about the fact that our travel health insurance plans will no longer provide coverage for care due to COVID 19? And yet the Cuban government requires tourist to have FULL medical coverage as a condition of entry to Cuba? Is that not a concern if not a contradiction?Edited: 9:58 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Madge. Never delete his stuff. His "" fan club"" as he liked to think he had , do it ."
"@355 I am quite sure ""non essential"" includes vacations in Cuba! As much as my vacation I booked was a important event for all of us concerned it would be hard to make a case that this is essential travel!"
I'm leaving in 5 days to Cuba.

"I think everyone needs to reconsider in light of the Canadian government warning against all travel. Of course we all want to get down to Cuba, but if the government closes the border, then we are stuck. As well, can we really trust that the virus is only limited to 3 cases in Cuba? We have a couple of weeks before cancelling......just wondering what others in the same situation are thinking and doing?"
"You will never be left out of country. Wish you people would think about it as to getting left behind .Edited: 11:07 am, March 14, 2020 "
Some of you are seriously out to lunch. Closing it’s borders? And then what? Cuba is expected to keep you indefinitely? You have a visa that expires. You’re a Canadian citizen with a right to come back to your country. Air Canada picked up Canadians from China in the midst of the outbreak. No one is being abandoned in any country... sheesh.
"@368 We are in the same situation maple, a couple of weeks to decide whether to go or not, we are leaning towards staying home and rebooking with our Air Transat credit! I am not concerned about being stuck there as I'm sure the government will let Canadians return, possibly not to our original airport (Hamilton) I just don't like the prospect of being quarantined in Cuba or in Canada upon return!"
"Well, first time the government has issued a global travel warning.....they will be announcing shortly what airports will have international flights.....what’s next? With the situation being so volatile and changing minute by minute, there are no guarantees."
Yes Air Canada picked up Canadians from China but many more Canadians are stuck in other parts of the World because they can't find a flight to bring them back home at this moment .I also saw one of your posts that you are not worry about the virus as you are a healthy person.Should tell that to the soccer players and other athletes around the world who got the virus and im sure they also thought the Virus was not for them but others as they were very healthy they thought .
I also have a trip in June its the least of my concern if i have to cancel if things will not change by then I have a family and grandsons and i think they are more important to me then a trip down south at this time but hey its just my opinion .As for people at the Grocery stores people are crazy never saw so many empty shelves at th stores like i have seen for the last 2 days but i guess they need that toilette paper lol .
"Where have you seen Canadians that cannot get home right now, outside of Iran? And my reference to being a healthy person doesn’t mean I’m immune to it it simply means that even if I did get it (which is in no way related to being in Cuba vs Canada), the chances of me not recovering are minimal. Again, this is a personal decision. It applies with any illness.More people have died in Canada from fridges falling on them. Going to an airport, traveling to Cuba and coming back poses some quarantine risks which everyone will have to assess on their own personal basis. Personally, I don’t think I’m much less of a risk being in Toronto vs Havana, nor do I think being in an airport is any more dangerous than being at CostcoEdited: 11:32 am, March 14, 2020 "
Here you go use a translator its in French .https://www.lapresse.ca/covid-19/202003/14/0…
"Admittedly, it’s a tough decision. We don’t have kids or elderly parents to worry about and are in excellent health, so the prospect of being on a beach in Varadero is so much better than the prospect of catching this crazy virus at the local grocery store. Does anyone know where we can get reliable info as to what the Cuban authorities will be doing once we land on their soil? We need to share as much reliable info as we can so that we can all make a wise and informed decision with respect to our upcoming trips."
I found the same story in English …https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/ca…
"There is some useful information posted on here as well as some nonsense, I have just been trying to decipher through it! As I have mentioned I have a feeling flights will be cancelled as the virus spreads making the decision for us! It is very tough to cancel a vacation we all so looked forward to, maybe in a week or 2 things will be much clearer!"
Not sure it would matter. Things are changing too quickly to rely on yesterday's news.
"I agree. I haven't booked yet for my April 18th flight-only to Holguin... something I consider to be ""essential travel"" to Cuba for reasons many of you know... but even I'm now questioning whether I should book at all for that date now. Things are just evolving too quickly to have any confidence in anything. If I DO book for that date, I think I'll be waiting until the last moment to firm it up, reassessing the situation at that time. Pricing is now beginning to fall through the floor, so there's that perk to be had on the upside too.Terry"
"In this thread, the voices of calm and non-panic are:- a guy who takes any opportunity to remind us of his love for taking unnecessary risks, and who has now taken to spewing wilfully misinformed nonsense in the interest of ""playing devil's advocate"". Fast losing all respect for this widely beloved rogue. - a guy who takes reported case numbers at face value, completely ignoring the severe lack of testing in the US and to a lesser extent Canada, and who apparently assumes that Cuba is -- somehow -- just as reliable in this respect. And who thinks the whole thing is all about generating website clicks. Yeah, OK. Gentlemen, I do hope you enjoy each trip to the buffet, and that nothing bad happens to you, like getting sick or even just finding yourself under quarantine someplace you don't want to be."
"I posted this in another thread. I'm not sure how accurate it is so don't shoot the messenger. If accurate 3 Canadians at present have gambled and lost.149 people admitted to Cuba, including 9 from Cienfuegos. Only 4 cases of COVID-19 confirmed (March 13)According to information provided by the Minister of Public Health these people are under medical and isolated care, in specialized health system centers for showing symptoms of respiratory diseases or having had contacts with the 4 proven cases of COVID-19 in the country.Of the total number of admitted 65 are foreign citizens and 84 CubansItaly: 20USA: 13Canada 3China 3Germany: 3Spain 4Mexico 4Argentina, Ecuador, Sweden and France: 2Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Nicaragua, Panama, United Kingdom and Dominican Republic: 1Havana: 42Villa Clara: 17Santi Spirits: 9Cienfires: 9Santiago de Cuba: 8Killings: 5Granma: 4Camagüey: 3Mayabeque: 2River Pinar: 1"
"“ guy who takes reported case numbers at face value, completely ignoring the severe lack of testing in the US and to a lesser extent Canada, and who apparently assumes that Cuba is -- somehow -- just as reliable in this respect. And who thinks the whole thing is all about generating website clicks. Yeah, OK.”Lol. Ok. So let’s avoid statistics where it doesn’t favor your argument and let’s accept it when it does. “Severe lack of testing” ?? Have you, for a second, considered that there are likely 1000’s of people around the world who simply caught this illness and didn’t report themselves and simply got better? Which in turn means the death rate of this is even less than what’s reported? Tell me, what’s your take on it? Cuba is not reporting the real number of cases and this is all a sham? Yeah, ok!"
"https://youtu.be/kDFbN2PCMKEA YouTube video specifically about the topic at hand. Cuba is taking measures at the airport by checking your body temperature, as they should. People who’s temperature is a potential indicator for having the illness are being quarantined — As they should be.It goes without saying that if you’re sick, stay home."
"There are two distinct issues here that I think most of us can see. 1) I'm taking basic precautions for myself as I normally do but being more vigilant lately as I always do during flu season. I'm not paranoid about contracting COVID-19 as I'm healthy but I'd rather not get sick. Even a common cold is not much fun and COVID doesn't sound like a good time either.2) I have concern for others that are more vulnerable. My mom for example. So it's not just a matter of protecting myself from an unpleasant week, it's the possibility that I could infect others. It always drove me crazy when coworkers would come to work sick with the flu or would visit others that were vulnerable to serious issues if they caught it. This increased awareness of the second point is a good thing IMO. People shouldn't have needed this episode in order to think about it but perhaps it will change behaviour in the future.Edited: 12:46 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"hola. i wonder, how many humans around the world have passed away recently with flu like symptoms that caused the death and most of them elderly, but were not tested for this virus because tests were and are not available. i wonder. nobody knows."
hola. nobody knows tomorrow.
hola. i wonder how many breathing machines Cuba has and i wonder how many are being used right now by Cubans without the virus.
"Guys, we can go in circles all day long. Like much of life, there’s going to be differences of opinion. I wouldn’t want to convince anyone who feels they are better not going and vice versa. To each their own. Perhaps the best advice in this thread is simply that the situation is changing every hour. Assess your personal choice and go from there. Who knows, maybe tomorrow we won’t even have to make this decision. For what it’s worth, the latest info I have from Alamar, Havana, is that life is continuing like normal at this time, but everyone is a bit on alert.All the best to allEdited: 12:58 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"It's all about flatting the curve, not what percentage of cases will ultimately be deadly. If the health care system is overwhelmed, here or there, unnecessary deaths will result, either from the virus, or from other causes because there is no capacity for care."
"hola. reply #392, well said!"
The only reason we are going in circles is the extreme views at both ends of the spectrum; those that believe this is much ado about nothing and those that are hunkered down in their homes with a pallet of toilet paper and a six month supply of canned goods.
"Two articles; They are in Spanish but hopefully your browser will translate them.The first one is about Cubans asking for the border to be shut. https:/… The second is the posting to back up my post about people in Cuba in hospitals etc. https:/…Edited: 1:20 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"I asked a friend in Havana about whether he thinks it’s best if Cuba closed its borders completely... his response?“We will die of hunger.” Simply put, they’re under so much tension already. Cut out the tourism and that’ll probably push them even more so to the edge... they’ll have to compare that risk vs the potential of bringing in those who are infected"
All my friends have said come.We need the tourist.Oh and that is from all the ones that kelly apparently has said hate me and laugh behind my back.
I’m due there on the 23rd and will be there for 2 weeks. I’ll try and answer any questions anyone has while I’m there.
"A good friend would be more concerned about their friends , and others , health and not about tourists dollars  ..Just saying Johnny C"
Canadians on this forum may want to take a look at the latest developments as per link below:https:/…
"I'm in Cuba now, have been since Jan 11th,scheduled to leave May 5th, so far it seems business as usual.No one seems to be in a panic mode, actually joking about the situation, mind you, this is a small town and not everyone has easy access to world news. Everyone is still hugging, kissing and shaking hands ( although I'm trying to ease up on that myself).The girl in the corner tienda was wearing a mask yesterday, obviously didn't like it, no mask today...ha !"
"hola. 'We need the tourist' they need the tourist with pesos and goods. friendship alone won't put food on the table, unless it is with help harvesting it. but good friendship can produce good chemicals in the blood."
"hola. Chris probably similar to alot of very small remote towns here in Canada, not living condition wise but the thinking that they are in their own small world."
"hola. reply #400, yup. my friends in Havana, what me to come, but do understand why i'm not visiting. instead of me spending money to get there, i sent some CUCs."
"Returned yesterday from Vedado, as Chris said, business as usual there as well. Only ones I seen with masks where staff at Jose Marti and half of them had them down around there neck as they didn't like wearing them either."
What do you mean it's happening? Are people being detained upon arrival?
"#409, how are inbound tourists being treated?"
Hola A Cuban friend is currently on a flight now to Havana from Rome. Scheduled to arrive at 11:35 pm. Apparently it is only retuning Cubans on that flight.I will know later what happens with those passengers (not tourists) and how they are treated after arrival.Cheers
"From a friend in Havana:“We have been through similar many times with Zika and Dengue. Over here we are not worried but alerted. Everything functioning normal right now except typical shortages”On the plus side, apparently one of the Cuban made medications is at the forefront of assisting (not curing) with the virus."
#412....I would hope the government will impose self-isolation or quarantine as they are coming from a country that has been greatly impacted by this virus. Please keep everyone posted.
You had better look to more upto date numbers.
For those that are still thinking about going insurance through Asistur is still available. Lenny
Flight cancellations are already starting . Friend had upcoming package trip to Dominican and was told her vacation package has been cancelled. Suspect this is whats going to happen next and the decision will be made for me!
Told by whom ?Lenny

What I really want to know is which airline is cancelling trips ?Lenny
"At the top of the Pearson airport website:The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has assessed the public health risk associated with COVID-19 (Coronavirus) as low for Canada at this time. We continue to work in collaboration with PHAC and our partners to ensure that all proper measures are taken to protect passengers.Also, weren’t we already told that certain airports won’t be accepting inbound international flights? No where did anyone indicate a complete closing of Canadian borders. At least not yet...."
"Whereas it is possible that your fellow traveller was infected on the plane to cuba, given the quick incubation period it is more likely that he was infected by some other virus. Or he had contracted the covid 19 or some other virus before getting on the plane. The median incubation time for Covid 19 is 5.1 days, but, having said that, it is possible he contracted covid 19 on the plane. Did anyone see a doctor or report the illness in Cuba?"
Thank you Kelp T. Much appreciated.
"On Thursday, the Province Ontario Ministry of Health released new guidance for the health sector to follow regarding COVID-19 testing.Under the new protocols, individuals who travelled outside of the country and are exhibiting symptoms of the disease will no longer be tested because of limited supply of viral nasopharyngeal swabs. These excluded individuals have been defined as “probable” cases under the province’s guidance.As a result of the limited supply, the province will be reserving testing for vulnerable groups.“In an effort to maintain capacity and make better use of supply, and in recognition that anyone travelling outside of the country is being asked to self-isolate for 14 days, we’re prioritizing those individuals without travel history with symptoms”"
"Hello. I just cancelled my holiday to Cayo Santa Maria, Cuba with SunWing Holidays . Yes, I am disappointed but I also suggest that individuals be realistic. With the social distance of 6 feet; it will be hard in an airport and impossible in the aircraft. You and you loved ones could be infected. Then, you bring it to the destination where you are flying into. OR, you pick it up at the destination and bring it home. OR, because you were in a hotel with someone who contracts the virus, or in a bus; you DO NOT go home! You must remain in their medical facility and when you get a green light to return home; you will need to self-isolate. My question to you and others is this: Is the 1 or 2 week holiday really worth all of these risks? I also heard that there are some insurance companies who will NOT cover any medical claims related to Covid 19 since the non-essential travel advisory was in effect as of last week. You should be freaking out...this could be a very big mistake."
"427 — sorry to hear about your cancellation and hope you’ll return to Cuba when possible. Out of curiosity, will you be staying home mainly? Grocery stores, gas pumps, etc? There is no end to this in sight... so how long can one really live like that?"
"I am scheduled to fly out on the 21st of March from YYZ.. I am still on fence in regards to actually going..I feel as though I am more likely to get this germ here at home and at work then I am in Cuba.. That said, i am worried our government will close the border leaving us stuck.... or worse in quarantine when we arrive back home...Still unsure what my decision will be.."
"HolaFurther to my post @ 412My friend arrived back in Havana from Italy (after working several months on a cruise ship) just a short time ago. Plane only had Cubans on it.

I’m not sure why you would want to go now!? You are putting yourself at risk and also chancing the risk of bringing the virus back home. Don’t be selfish and cancel your trip.
Well it seems Air Canada and other companies sure want to make a fast profit anything goes during these hard times .Some Canadians are still stuck in Europe and other places around the World .Paris to Montreal $3.307Casablanca to Montreal $5.431 These are one way flights sure would not want to be one of the tourists trying to get back home at this time .Story is in French …https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/03/15…

The Canadian government is advising to not travel outside of Canada due to the pandemic virus. It is being selfish because you run the risk of catching the virus at the airport and airplane and then returning to Canada all because someone wants a vacation. There are lots of places to visit (vacation) in Canada. This is a global crisis and we want to stop the spread of this disease. At least wait until there is control of this virus. I hope Canada closes its borders!
"UHHH! Why do we need a government when it seems that policy is being made out of misplaced fear and panic? I'll listen to my government and wait for them to pull the plug if they deem it necessary. If they don't, then there's no reason not to go, other than what my company may tell me tomorrow regarding their policy, and that of my company provided health insurance policy coverage. Btw Kiki, I won't be vacationing... I'll be visiting with my legally married wife and family that live there.TerryEdited: 12:24 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Halting travel now is really a mute point. The virus has already spread.....virtually every country has it. It is no longer just airports and planes, the usual suspects, that pose infection. That being said, countries with large outbreaks should close their borders, only to minimize global impact. It’s happening now. What it all means down the road is anyone’s guess."
"All I am saying is that we need to listen to our government advising us to not travel. We need to close the borders in order to slow the spread of the virus at least for the next few weeks. Personally, I would not want to be in another country if I caught the virus. I’m pretty sure that Canadians with the virus today is due to travel. Are you not watching the news? Canada MAY close it’s borders. If anyone is still willing to travel knowing this then don’t complain when you are unable to come home."
"Kiki — it’s an advisory, not mandatory. Trust me, if it was at a stage that it was mandatory, the government would have taken action already and made it so. We constantly get driving advisories here when it snows... I drive, maybe you don’t?The virus is started in China so literally every case outside of China is due to travel. There are studies which show that traveling at this point doesn’t hurt and it doesn’t help. What are your concerns as a Canadian? That you’ll catch it from the cases in Cuba, which are 50times less than Canada’s cases? Or are you concerned someone would catch it at the airport or airplane going over? In which case, you may as well lock yourself at home and not visit the grocery store or gas station....Canada closing its borders doesn’t mean it will not allow its own citizens back in. Please don’t spread false rumors."
"Kiki, you worry too much. Personally, I only worry about finding my beer in Cuba... that's enough for me.Terry"
"Terry, where abouts will you be and when? I’ll be in Havana. Come by for a beer if you’re in the city"
Well said...
"Only problem with flying and airports is that you are in constant close contact with other people, far more than any situation that you can control at home. Airplanes are petri dishes for germs, no matter how much they say they clean the plane. Your neighbors on the plane are inches away from you. Seeing that the covid 19 virus is more contagious than the regular flu, that makes the chance of contracting the virus or you spreading it to others is even greater.Bonne chanceEdited: 1:22 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"HA! Thanks for the offer, Hyru. But I'll be flying into Holguin and then taking a 3 hour taxi to the city of Camaguey where my wife and I have our casa.

"@490, and empty flight for you will be a flight that is not going.....they might need to pick up people already there, but they will not want to commit to returning for one passenger in a week or two, so good luck with that. If enough people cancel I doubt the flights will still be happening."

The Globe asked them about offering discounts when the government is advising not to travel. They have not responded back yet. Read farther down the article for the discounting stuff. The first part is them parking planes and laying off staff https:/…
"WestJet is flying to Holguin (flight-only) for $339 now. That's an insane price! If I booked at that price, that would be the lowest I've ever firmed up at in 15 years of travel to Cuba.

"i notice the world death rate % seems to be rising. the good news is the serious/critical % rate seems to be dropping, for now."
i wonder if the death rate will rise or hasn't already because of a lack of medical procedures for the ones who don't have the virus. one would have to think it has.
lolWhat a loonie.
"@511, that has been the experience in other countries when the health care system is overwhelmed by covid patients. No ICU beds or ventilators available for ""regular"" patients. BTW, Ontario is closing the casinos. Now you know how serious this is!"
"@513Well yes, if the casinos are closing things really are getting serious.The whole point of many of the measures is not to contain it (that horse left the barn) it is to slow down the spread with the goal of not overwhelming the health care system"
"@514, absolutely. As you hear so often, ""flattening the curve"" is the goal here. And for those criticizing how this is being handled, politicians are not doctors. They are following the advice of the health care professionals, as they should.Edited: 6:13 pm, March 15, 2020 "
The UK put out an urgent request for ventilators today.

"reply #520, do you think our health experts have been doing the right thing from the start of this back in the beginning of January? TWO and a HALF months ago! March 15th today. i would call that dropping the ball a very very very big ball. lo siento."
"@522, do you think the population would have been open to strict restrictions at that time? Every country this has hit has had to adjust, none have managed to keep it out entirely. Some have done better (so far) at managing things, but typically those are countries where citizens do as they are told, e.g. Singapore, Taiwan, a few others.

"We returned from Cuba to Toronto today. I strongly urge you to postpone your plans. Everyone is nervous, including in Cuba. Number of cases is growing exponentially and the only way out is cutting exposure, not only to save yourself, but to save others you might infect.

I can see where killing off the old folk has some merit. Make room for some young blood. However at 63 I am not quite ready to make that commitment. The young folk will just have to wait for a bit longer.

"Well it seems the Federal gouvernment is starting to wake up and going to do something about people flying out of the country later on the day Only Airports that will be open will be Montréal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver and that will be for how long we will have to see ."
I should also say its for the International flights coming in to the country .
"The government is also strongly recommending that all Canadians now return to Canada from abroad ASAP. That's most likely a prelude to a further announcement that the government will soon be suspending all international flights to destinations outside of the country as well. Not looking good now for anyone anticipating their flights to Cuba within the coming days, weeks, and perhaps months.Terry"
I can see a total shut down myself. International travel will be at a standstill. People just aren't booking to go anywhere.
"Here in Ontario:Provincial Government Press Conference Government at 11AM, followed by Federal Government Press Conference at 1PM. Across the border in Michigan, all restaurants, bars, etc...have been shut down effective 3PM today."
"@ 386: ""Tell me, what’s your take on it? Cuba is not reporting the real number of cases and this is all a sham?""My take: Cuba has little or no clue what the real number of cases is. Coincidentally or not, Cuba also has a vested interest in low, reassuring numbers. And Canada and the US don't have much more of a clue.My point about severe lack of testing is this: with widespread testing, you can identify mild and asymptomatic cases and get those people out of circulation, slowing the spread. Not happening here. Not happening in Cuba AFAIK. And yes, the overall fatality rate will be lower when this is done. You say this almost like it's a bad thing. Well, I'd rather know a number closer to a true fatality rate than one inflated by failure to test anyone who doesn't need immediate medical attention. You know what else inflates fatality rates? Letting the thing get out of control until every ICU bed and every respirator are in use, with critically ill people waiting in line. Also: Cuba's population skews old. You are young, healthy and at minimal direct personal risk. Congratulations. Also, congratulations on being willing to potentially spread this virus in a developing country with a disproportionate number of elderly. A country where it can be impossible to find the most basic of first-aid supplies, even as a tourist who can easily afford them. A country that is overall ill-equipped to handle a significant outbreak. Lastly:Those of us who are healthy (aka potentially infected but asymptomatic) should do what we can to slow the spread.Edited: 10:24 am, March 16, 2020 "
I feel like I am living in the Twilight Zone reading some of your posts! Very disappointing reading that a vacation for some is more important than saving lives. Humanity sucks sometimes! For the few that are taking this crisis as a joke...I am lost for words.
"i was reading this morning the local paper tourists from this Province being stuck in Vietnam others in Morroco and some other countries and complain because they can't get back home .Why did these people wait for the last minute to get a flight back home oh yes i forgot they thought it was a joke and now some of these countries have no flights at all to Canada ,Did you not know about this before leaving i would say yes but i guess some people are thinking like this is a playing game a joke so go ahead go on vacation like many others are doing only thing is don't complain after if they can't bring you home on the dates you were suppose to and get pissed at the Airlines ."

"Vicki, where are you getting these stats? Okay, see it there....havana60.com......thanks for sharing such relevant information.Edited: 11:20 am, March 16, 2020 "
Someone posted an article on Facebook under the Ocean Vista Azul page with the complete article. I referenced it above...Havana60.comGo on the Facebook page and you will see it there.
I posted that on several Facebook pages and I'm posting the Air Passenger Rights there as well:https:/…coronavirus-how-to-get-a-refund
"Seems that lots of relevant information is NOT getting out. People really need to STOP joking and stay put at home. I’m sure since this information was published on the 14th, it is much worse 2 days later. I too am a person who had to cancel my vacation, so I get it. But come on people...this is a world wide crisis, and I for one am very frightened."
"Bizarre Events , that for sure .Johnny C"
"The Canadian Government has stated they will not repatriate any citizens who are stranded in other countries.I wonder how long before the flight attendant unions decide they don't want to risk the health of their members and refuse to work. What do all the folks in Cuba do then?CBC interviewed a couple in DR who were trying to get themselves, and I think 4 kids but maybe only 3, home to Canada early. They were having a very hard time getting back early. Air Canada said no way. They also said they talked to their hotel and still 60-70% of their bookings were still arriving."
@Spunky....do you think I cancelled too early to push for a full refund? I am assured of a voucher but....who knows when and if I get to use it.
"Hola @549It is your comfort zone, looks like many pulled the pin, perhaps a little early, the way things are going, it is anyone's guess. We all will soon find out, if they cancel the flights, then cash. I have not cancelled yet, but we are not going, waiting to see about what WestJet does, also have Blue Cross, so I have cash that way...."
"Grapes, that's what I'm thinking...did we do this too early...and when do we get this voucher, and how do we know we're even getting one...where is it....I'm losing it."
Tried to message you Spunky but my message sending ability is down for some reason.
I have not seen hide nor hair of this promised voucher...I have only dealt with travel agent. Only the 2nd time we ever booked online or thru remote means...not local TA. Both times now it has been problematic...
You cancelled at the perfect time grapes...we all followed :) Fair question...I'd rather have the cash back and book when or if I wanna book in the next 12 months. Strange btw how my post @532 reappeared after a few pages went by :)
"We might have played our cards wrong mind you....we should've waited until they cancelled our flights, damit! Thanks rrrricher! :)"
"HolaGuys, this is not normal times, why would you not get your vouchers?....give it some time, it is not like anyone is going anywhere? lolcheers."
I know that there is a high volumne of people cancelling. Just not impressed in what little communication there is.
"Canadian borders closed to all non citizens...Flights to Cuba and back are all good. If you get quarantined in Cuba, they will get you home.. minty....Everyone still going?"
"The thing that bothers me right now, we did cancel, got this voucher, but have never received an email or anything saying we did this...so how do we really know we did."
There’s no better insurance than this new news

Just read on memories jibacoa facebook page sunwing suspending all flights to Cuba
"I thought I'd jump into this discussion after monitoring it over the last few days. I am suppose to fly out to Varadero next Tuesday with WestJet vacations, and this is my dilemma:I understand everyone's concerns and most points of view. We all have our opinions and what we do or do not feel comfortable doing. Where I lack clarity is with our (Canadian) governments (seemingly) vague ""policy"" as well as airlines position. GOC advises against ""all non-essential""travel and today they said they will no longer accept non-Canadian travelers (aside from US & diplomats) to Canada. In the mean time airlines (WestJet anyway) seem to still be flying to Cuba... My frustration is with ""advising"", if they believe we shouldn't be flying out, why is WestJet offering flights to Cuba (and no there is no mention its only for Cuban citizens) and leaving it optional to cancel our trip rather than giving refund/credit? I hope I made my point with some clarity. What I look for from my government is clear and decisive action. If they state we should self isolate, and not travel outside our borders, then that is what I will do. BUT if the message is , we don't recommend traveling abroad (outside obvious COVID-19 hot zones), but you still can, essentially be cautious if you travel abroad and when you come back you MUST self isolate then I will do just that. I will make an educated decision given the information at the time.My second question, to which I hope I know the correct answer is: IF we decide proceed with plans and while in Cuba things change and our government says (for example) Canadians must return to Canada within 72hrs before we lock down all entry exits into the country, are the airlines we have return flights with obligated to bring us back?In the end, whatever your opinion may be, be safe, exercise caution , be kind to one another and don't give into panic. In time this will pass."
Sunwing still want us to use the Worry Free insurance. I want a full refund. The flight was cancelled.
@566.....we are also with WestJet Vacations and are scheduled to leave soon. We will wait to see if WestJet follows suit with Sunwing and cancels its flights down south. Strange that nothing about Sunwing’s decision to cancel southbound flights for the next 3 weeks has been reported on in the news.
Just saw it on CP24 news.
We have no choice but to Cancel ours as Sunwing has suspended all Southbound flights from 17 March to 09 April.We were leaving out of Windsor which has no further flights to Cuba after 02 April.It sucks but nothing we can do
"Update on my situation with Nash Travel: Despite Cuba announcing yesterday (3/20) that no tourists can enter the country and my having already provided Nash with written confirmation from the hotel that they will be issuing Nash Travel a FULL refund of $4560, Nash Travel is sticking by their policy and informed me yesterday that they are penalizing me $1140 for canceling this hotel reservation for me and my 90-year-old mother whom I was taking to Havana for the first time on April 1st for her birthday. Disheartening behavior at a time when so many people and businesses are supporting one another during these unprecedented and uncertain times. Shame on you Nash Travel!"
"#571 unfortunate that you continue to harp on about your own selfish issue. I'm guessing if you are happy to pay to stay in the Kempinski you are happy with the price & can afford it.There are much more serious goings on in Cuba / Canada / US etc etc that deserve attenion rather than a me, me, me approach you seem to have.Leave it until the crisis is over & take it up then.I think you'll also find that many travel organisations are not offering anyone cash refunds at the moment but credits etc against future travel.Edited: 12:55 pm, March 21, 2020 "
Omg thank you!!!
"#572: Yeah, perhaps you're right and I'll drop it for now. Just very angry with how I was treated by Nash. And, this was A LOT of money for us to spend on what was to have been a once in a lifetime trip."
"I would think a lawyers letter to Nash might be worth trying.I am more shocked at seeing that only a few days ago there were people on this thread still planning to travel to Cuba. AndEdited: 2:16 pm, March 21, 2020 "
Now entry to Cuba already is not possible: https://restrictions.info/tr/country/cu/ :(
Thanks Andrey....is that a deserted island you're standing on? :)
"Now that we are all home and long finished our 14 day self quarantines, does anyone think they got infected while away?"
Five Canadians tested positive in Cuba - it appears that they arrived in Cuba with the virus.
Curious to know if you went to Cuba? I flew in on March 05 to spend two weeks travelling around eastern Cuba. On the 21st of March I was ordered by Immigration to a Quarantine Hotel Near Holguine and later to another Quarantine Hotel near Havana for an additional 2 weeks on my stay (at my expense). My scheduled return flight on Air Transat March 25th was cancelled the day before it was to depart. I finally got home April 04. If you did go you may have had a similar experience?????
I didn't know that. Do you have a link to that story?
"Letmesay, #581, which post are you referring to?Edited: 3:46 pm, April 16, 2020 "
Yes Cuba will not let tourists in till maybe August 16th I have a house on my Cuban friends land and I will be seeing Cuba on the 4 th of August when my trip was planned for 3 weeks
"Jeff, you will be allowed to see the house when Cuba is in phase 3 and flights come to Cuba (other then repatriation). Cuba has not announced any date as to when phase 3 will happen. I'm somewhat doubtful that tourist will be allowed into Cuba beggining of August, especially if you are from the US. I don't know for Canada, but both Sunwing and Transat have no flights for beggining of August."
West jet is hoping to fly august 7th to cayo coco. Tripcentral has flights listed for end of July to Varadero. We will see...
Very optimistic
I think come 21st july and canada opens up their lockdown a bit more things will start to fly.Optimistic?No travel industry insistence or they go under.
"Better to be optimistic than the other option. Canada may be slow to reopen given the mess in the US right now. Over 60,000 new cases per day."
They do not need to open that border with trumpton.
"Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb"
"The Canadian travel advisory and the 14 days quarantine upon return to Canada are in place until at least August 31. I don't see any flights happening to Cuba while those things are in place, because very few people will want to travel. There was a flight to Cancun last week, apparently it was full. I would guess that the few people who want to travel will mostly want to take that option."
"Hola@591 - While I have seen a date for the quarantine posted at least until August 31 - the Canadian Government's official global travel advisory to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada (and avoid all cruise ship travel) is in place until further notice. Unless I missed something, there is currently no date mentioned regarding the advisory, apart from the effective date of March 13, 2020.Cheers"
"Rrrichard, I probably misread or assumed both were going hand in hand regarding dates. Thanks for the clarification."
"Rrrichar. Yes, I agree. Hasn’t there been a travel advisor in place for Mexico since, well, a very long time? The travel advisors are just that, advisories. I am planning a trip to Cayo Las Brujas in November. Upon my return I will quarantine with or without the federal laws in place. This is based on good science, not man made laws. Maybe the science will change by November. Even the WHO is now conceding that Covid may be airborne. Wear a mask. Watch your distance. Wash your hands. These three Ws will be with us for a long time.Gengen, sorry but I don’t understand your comment about going to Cancun over Cuba. Canadians need to quarantine upon return no matter where they have travelled. A lot of travellers, particularly retirees and those working from home, would not have much of an issue isolating themselves for 14 days. This is my belief anyway. It is for the common good."
Hola OceanblueThere are different levels of travel advisories that the Canadian government will issue for countries - or even specific provinces within countries:Level 1 - Practice usual precautions. Travel health notices advise practicing usual travel health precautions. ...Level 2 - Practice special precautions. ...Level 3 - Avoid non-essential travel. ...Level 4 - Avoid all travel.There is a difference between the 4 levels - and these are usually recognized with respect to coverage with travel medical insurance. It should be important to know the difference and what the implications could be before you decide to travel. It has to do with more than self quarantining upon your return.Cheers
"Oceanblue, I believe that the few people who want and can travel right now will mostly pick Cancun over Cuba because :1- They are sure to get he food and drinks they want. No one knows what the situation will be when the hotels reopen for international tourism here, but even before the pandemic, hotels were running out of some items quite often.2- In Cancun, they can venture out to towns, not in Cuba. It's just my opinion. But seems I'm not enough because there are no package going to Cuba until at least August."
"Mexico had almost 7,000 new cases of COVID-19 yesterday... meanwhile Cuba had only 7. If flying to Mexico from Canada was possible right now, traveling out to the towns in Mexico from their resorts would be the last thing I'd want to do there. The safe money is and will always be on Cuba when able. Nobody will go hungry at the AI resorts in Cuba either.Terry"
"Hola Terry @597I know what you mean about the high number of daily cases being reported in Mexico, and personally, it would be a pretty big concern for me also if I was planning to travel there. Which I am not.On the other hand, it might be interesting to think about where the international tourists are going to be coming from that will be sharing your hotel amenities in Cuba, and how that might impact your level of safety. Those fellow travelers could be coming from countries with much higher recent daily confirmed cases than Canada. For example, I have noticed a large increase in the number of Russian tourists at the hotels I stay at on Cayo Santa Maria. On our last trip to Cayo Santa Maria in January, our plane arrived at the Santa Clara airport after a Russian plane. I am not an aviation buff, but even I could tell this plane was huge. There were at least a dozen flight attendants waiting in the immigration line up next to us - which gives you an idea that there were many passengers that had already passed through earlier. Russia has been reporting over 6,000 new cases daily. I heard from a worker at one of the hotels on CSM that they were expecting guests from Russia some days ago, but the flight had been cancelled so no one arrived.My point is that the risk may be beyond what the numbers are currently in Cuba with the Cuban population once you arrive there, and may be something some may want to take into consideration.As for the comment about no one will go hungry at the AI resorts in Cuba..... that is likely true. But hopefully you don't mind eating hot dogs - creatively used in a large number of food options, and are not too picky on the other things available at mealtimes lol! Cheers"
"I agree Oceanblue. I also feel safer in Cuba then I would in Mexico. AND yet, there are flights from Canada to Mexico and none to Cuba. Also, flights landed in Cancun from the US (I heard 16) yesterday. I have not looked at the numbers now, and my data is too slow, but Mexico is big. How is Cancun doing number wise? I thought they were doing pretty good. In any case, I feel that most people who are traveling right now are those who really don't care if they get Covid and/or feel that it's not a big deal, like the Sping breakers kids. So their decisions are not based on where is the safest, it's best on where are they going to have the best vacation based on their criterias. Based also on the available trips right now."
"Interesting take on that situation @599, rrrichar. Even though tourism is now possible under Phase 2 conditions in Cuba, I wonder if the Cuban government has established a list of what countries it has deemed acceptable for travel to Cuba based on their current daily COVID-19 cases. I've not heard anything to that effect... has anyone else?Terry"
"Rrrichar. Thank you. Good points. Yes, I have been thinking about personal safety at resorts. Everyone should be. I wonder if masks will be mandatory indoors and how distancing will been enforced. 'Crystal clear' drunk people can't socially distance, say police in England. Read a headline in the Guardian. Really? I had no idea!The Cuban government is not going to want to have international news reports of Covid outbreaks. Not a good look. Nor is masking, but better than spreading the virus. I would certainly think officials have been working on lists of countries, even within countries, managing the virus well. Again, something I’ve been pondering. Temperature checks ain’t gonna cut it."
This is strictly my perspective ! Too many Cuban Americans in Florida wanting to come home for a visit Big Problema!
"i know shouldn't, but, i can't see, but i do wish them much luck, Cuba's phase 2 for turistas working, sooner or later, one would have to think, bang. Although maybe with turistas from New Zealand and Iceland, maybe bueno! ps - yup it seems alcohol and masks and 'social distancing' don't seem to mix well."
"Going from Canada mixed with others on the plane and at the airport won't be so much the problem for me... at least others on the plane will all be Canadians, with some semblance of confidence once Canada begins permitting flights again. Even when I'll personally spend my 2 weeks in Cuba as an independent traveler, I'll be very much isolated in our tiny barrio of Cam city with wifey and the family having very little to worry about. However it'll be my flight back from Cuba to Canada that'll be the most potentially threatening to me and to the rest of us on that plane too as I'll once again meet up with those same Canadians who will have now mingled with other people from other parts of the world at the AI resorts, just long enough that they could possibly be infected and contagious on the trip back. Am I worried? No, not worried, not at all. But it will be on my mind at the time as I pinch my mask down tighter around the top of my nose.TerryEdited: 7:10 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"That’s a good approach, Terry. To be aware but not ‘worried’. I will be wearing a face shield as well as a mask. Dress as drs and nurses do, save the N95. The virus goes for the, ahem, mucous membranes, which includes the eyes. I have also seen goggles sold at opticians. Basically, if you are wearing a mask and someone isn’t wearing a mask or isn’t wearing it properly and you are sitting closer than who really knows how many feet, you are at risk. Masks don’t adequately protect the wearer, we are told.You could fashion a visor nicely on your cap!Edited: 7:33 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"Can everyone imagine the panic when someone starts hacking up a lung on the aircraft during flight?? There's always one or two who do that... along with the crying baby... both just won't let me completely drift off to nap. But now, people will be freaking out when someone starts coughing.""You could fashion a visor nicely on your cap!""I have a better full face covering to wear...... Oceanblue, I am your father! jijiTerry ;-)"
Well said. Not a great virus to go through. Also give the front lines a break.
"Cancun? freaky, 25 international flights daily. It says hotel/resorts for now 30% capacity. The ruins closed for now. They say in the Cancun & Maya region 4,000 total reported cases 2,000 reported recovered. 5th ave. open. freaky! Should be somewhat easier for Cuba to try and control the turistas visiting in Phase 2 compared to Cancun area."
Darth!Nice one!
