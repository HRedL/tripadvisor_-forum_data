"This scared me because I have a cat & I live alone. On top of that, the news did a story where my local wine store had an employee test positive for Covid-19. Luckily, I was there 2 days before they said the ""danger dates"" were & I did curbside pick-up but it does worry me that if I get sick in the future not only would I have an issue with pet care but also, I could be giving my cat the same virus."
"Since the zoo is closed, the tiger may have been infected by one of the keepers, though they do not have intimate contact with the animal. If this is not the case, then it raises the possibility that Covid-19 can be spread by other means such as birds. When I worked at a medical school in the Bronx, one of the simians became infected with TB that was found to be from a staff member."
What I heard was that one of the keepers in charge of the big cats had come done with Covid-19 so they think that it was a case of human to animal spread although it was originally thought that the virus was species specific but apparently that isn't so.

"According to a report posted today on CNet, cats are more likely than dogs to be able to pick up the virus from their guardians. Sorry, but I couldn't copy & paste it but if you Google CNet cats & dogs, you should find it."
"In Hong Kong, a woman contracted covid-19 and successfully recovered from it. Her pet pomeranian tested positive for coronavirus and died, but it is not known if its death was caused by covid-19. A second dog in Hong Kong, a German shepard, whose owner contracted covid-19, has also tested positive for the virus. https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-firs…https://www.marketwatch.com/story/second-dog…"
Scary stuff with all these animal cases too.
Just heard on BBC that cat owners in UK are advised to keep their cats inside during the lockdown. There is apparently a concern they could pick up virus from being touched by humans they encounter while outside.

Domestic urban cats should be indoor pets. If they are they can’t get the virus except from you. If you stay safe so does kitty. The theory that it can be passed from fur to person isn’t unheard of but probably more likely from a dog. Because dogs are out and about more. I got poison ivy as a kid from a friend’s dog so that sort of transmission isn’t unheard of.
"There are 2 reasons that those of us who are cat guardians (& my cat is indoor only.) First, we don't want to be shedding the virus onto our cats for our own & our cat's health. Second, for those of us whose only companion is our cat, who will take care of our cat if we end up hospitalized?"
"There is a NYT article cited in the coronavirus thread which mentions the spread of the virus through animals. The Horseshoe Bat in China may be the origin, but it probably passed through other animals such as pangolins before infecting humans. This likely began in late 2019. Genetic sequencing has considerably improved our understanding of disease."
