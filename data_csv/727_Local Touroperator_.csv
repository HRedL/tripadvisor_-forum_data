How much to hire a driver for the day?
"For me no problem to go with a Russian tour or have a driver, who speaks only Russian. :-)"
Is it still actual? Maybe I could help
"Hi Nick. Just jumping into this thread to ask you a question. So, we really just want a driver for a day, with this following plan:Pick us up at the Kaliningrad airport at around 9am, on Thursday 21st Maytaking us perhaps via Polessk to look at a few sites around Sovetsk, and then Neman to see the castle and anything else you might think would interest us. ThenPerhaps heading back via Chernyakhovsk if the route is OK just for a different view?And dropping us back in the city (Kaliningrad )From Google maps, this looks like about 4.5 hours of driving, plus some waiting time while we look at things, so probably getting back to the city around 5pm or 6?Happy to consider suggestions.Thanks Darren"
"Hi, that's quite unusual route choice. I will reply to your personal message, so we could discuss it."
"Ok, thanks."
is there possibility to hire a coach for a small group (15-20 pax) from the border at Kybartai til Gusev? and some days transport in the neighborhood? area of Chernyakhovsk and Babushkino.somebody can help?thank you
"Sounds possible. Reach me closet to a travel date, I will try to help you with information.At the moment the border is closed due to the COVID-19 and all tourist industry is playing dead."
"the 1st or 2nd week in september. yes, here the borders are closed also until august 31 because of covid-19"
"We had a record confirmed-per-day number this week. Hard to say what to expect and when. As I believe, nothing official yet."
