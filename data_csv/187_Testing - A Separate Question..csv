Is anyone aware of the extent of Covid-19 testing being done on Isla?
"BTW, this question is in the face of the Mexican President's statement of a few minutes ago that Covid-19 is ""no worse than the flu"".It might be nice to find out if they're doing anything on Isla to further the investigation. I would think that would interest frequent visitors. On the other hand, I could be wrong."
I’ll reply so you don’t have to keep bumping your thread. Hi.
I will help too since no one else is going to reply.
Yeah me too. Did the president really make that comment. Someone else has stated in another post “the lack of testing”. ????

I agree. AMLO likely mention it in his press conference once he learns who is concerned about it.
