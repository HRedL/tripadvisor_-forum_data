"The first two Covid-19 cases have appeared in Zambia.A Zambian couple who went to France for their holidays have tested positive.https:/…I've heard, but can't confirm, they are from Chilanga, which is a suburb to the south of Lusaka, a little further south than Eureka Camp off Kafue Road."
"Update - they aren't from Chilanga but after a short period of self-isolation were tested, the husband was positive and they ended up in a quarantine centre in Chilanga - didn't know we had one, but there you are.They arrived back on the Emirates flight on March 15th after a time in France."

"Thanks Mark.I think we're all going to get it or have it. I can't see how we can avoid it especially knowing that some people carrying the virus will have no symptoms.I suspect the real figure is much higher than 2.Edited: 11:04 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Mukuma, and that is the conundrum. You have to be tested to say whether you have it or not. So as in many countries, there could well be many people who do have it but haven't been tested, so the figures don't show they have it. If you see what I mean.I know Zambia is quite determined in following up those who arrive in the country to see if they develop it or not in the first 14 days after entering and if you are showing signs then you go to an isolation centre to wait it out.All the measures used to mitigate the spread, like social distancing etc, I'm not so sure would have the same effect in the country due to practical reasons, tradition and the different way of living - e.g. self-isolation and distancing in the compounds? Hmmmm.....Then there has been a reminder for those who have staff/maids/nannies, that if they self-isolate, for it to be effective, their staff has to be with then and do it also. I can't see that happening."
Very true Mark.None of the NHS frontline staff are being tested here.There must be alot of cross contamination going on there. No one knows the true figure.
"Sorry to hear that covid-19 has (inevitably, I know) arrived in Zambia.The economic impact worldwide to contain the virus is going to be devastating in itself."
"Amongst all the negative issues, and I'm not diminishing them, but there is a positive for the environment. Satellite photos of less pollution and of canals in Venice clearing up and so on. It's no consolation for sure for those who have lost loved ones, but it is still there.But all I can say is that I'm waiting for it to sweep through Africa like a... well... a virus."
Third case announced today. A man returning from Pakistan.Just to keep you updated.
"The conundrum is/was, do I stay in a country that has only a few cases so far, but a poor health service and poor 'management' and hope it doesn't get any worse, or do I return to a European country where things seem a lot worse in regards to the number of cases, but currently has very good management, has fewer restrictions than many countries, a superb health service and a far lower death rate than virtually anywhere else to sit it out?My questions for staying are things like, how many ventilators has Zambia got, qualified doctors, hygiene in medical establishments, the practical ability to keep distance, the availability of getting food and medical supplies imported or otherwise, the question of Zesco and their 12 hour power cuts, how likely are any measures put in place to be effective in Zambia, how likely is there to be an explosion of cases in the first place anyway (probably looking so far, not too probable but nevertheless) and so on and on.So yes, I am of a vulnerable age and though having no underlying medical issues and fit enough I prefer to play safe and I've 'run away' and you'll find me/family digging out the warm weather clothes we've packed away for so long, in Germany.Hence my personal experience, being in the country knowledge, will be somewhat muted for the foreseeable future.Stay healthy."
"By the way, Zambia is up to 28 cases now, no deaths, but there will be extreme reluctance on the part of the government to isolate the country as it relies so heavily on imported goods and even though one measure is to only allow in cargo, the borders are very porous.All international flights can now only land in Lusaka for the passengers to be screened and any cross border bus travel is supposed to not stop until it reaches Lusaka to a dedicated bus station - well, obviously that's not working straight away. The airport thing yes, the bus thing, no way at all."
"Just a bit of an update - my last post above was 29th March and mentioned 28 cases and no deaths.Today, 17th April there are 48 cases and two deaths.I am pleasantly surprised at the lack of transmission/infection within the country and hope it continues. I don't really care if it is because of one thing or another, I just care that the figures stay as low as possible.A couple of days ago a returning resident, returning from New Zealand and an NZ citizen, arrived at Lusaka airport.The current regulations stipulated they isolate at home for 14 days as they showed no signs of being infected - otherwise they'd have been taken to a special quarantine facility.As it turns out, they were taken anyway. It was a miserable affair with no food, old dirty beds, no mossie nets etc etc.They appealed for help as this was unexpected and they had already arranged their food and so on to be available at their home.Various high up people were contacted by other high up people and a day or so later, they were released and sent home. Nobody admitted to knowing why there were originally detained.The point is - the rules have now changed a day or two after when yesterday an edict came out from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that anyone at all arriving in the country will be detained at a government facility, at their own cost, for 14days. Anyone, be they citizens, residents, truckers, bus passengers or whatever.You cannot isolate at home any more and this has been blamed on those that have arrived (various nationalities are supposed to be guilty of this and none Zambian) but not gone home and done it. They've gone about their normal business.Quite how the logistics of this, with the country having a vast number of border points, will be implemented, I have no idea. Nor does anyone know how long this will last for."
"Just remembered something else I was going to mention -""President Edgar Lungu has directed every citizen in the country to put on a mask as they leave their houses to go to public places.""https:/…"
"As of this morning the number of cases is 65. Seems to be growing quickly :(Are there stats on whether it's all known contact, or are they seeing community transmission?"
"In the last 24 hours or so up to the latest news, there were four more cases making as you say, 65.(There are currently 3 deaths.)Two were in Kafue and not yet known where/who it was caught from (but discovered during mass screening) and two were the nurses that were treating at Chilenge Hospital a woman who tried to commit suicide by drinking a herbicide. During her treatment she tested positive for the virus.The hospital at Chilenge has been closed to be disinfected/treated because of the two nurses becoming infected.To answer your question, there probably are stats, but finding them is a different matter."
"I'm still hunting for the official announcement of the following but I've no doubt to it's accuracy. It's been reported that for those wishing to enter Zambia -""Once passengers arrive in the country, specimen will be collected.Mandatory 14 days quarantine.For Zambian nationals, these are taken to either Balenge in Chilanga or Bauleni (Hospitals around Lusaka).For Foreign nationals, these are taken to Fallsway lodge or Wesu lodge and it will be at their own cost.Zambia Airports will arrange free transport to be taken to those areas.Fallsway lodge fees are: $100 per person per night for one apartment, $150 per night for a 2 bedroom apartment, $200 for a 3 bedroom apartment.Wesu lodge are charging $500 per person per night.They can only be released once they test negative and will be under home quarantine.""Clarification is needed as to the conflict between the edict of a compulsory 14 day quarantine and that people will be released if they test negative before that."
"Some further information and a correction - Wesu Lodge is Kwacha 500 a night, not $500.Also other official hotels are Cresta Golf View, Radisson Blue and the Hilton."
"Interesting. So they will do the nasal swab for all international arrivals, and then allow people to move on if the test is negative? Any ideas on what the turn-around is for the tests? Here in California the turn around was super long at first, but now down to 1-2 days."
"1) I have no idea what the method of testing is. If you say that is what it would be, then ok.2) Turnaround is I understand two to three days.3) I mentioned, ""Clarification is needed as to the conflict between the edict of a compulsory 14 day quarantine and that people will be released if they test negative before that."" - and no clarification is forthcoming so far so I have no idea if they are allowing people to move on with a negative test result when that comes in. I'm still waiting for something official on that. I'd expect so, but expectation and reality is often different, especially in Africa."
"Thanks, Mark for all those first- or second-hand information on the Covid-19 situation in Zambia. Yours are the most convincing and sound most reliable that I could find anywhere on the net. Keep us posted!"
Thanks.I'll certainly update things as much as I can when significant changes occur.
Up to 95 today :(Any more news?
So I found this article. Seems like the test/contact tracing is working relatively well....https:/…
"I think yesterday there were no reported cases at all. But today the total has slipped up again.Just let me make a couple of points though, points that concern me and unfortunately don't really have a good answer.1) China has donated just recently a quantity of medical supplies and PPE.I constantly now read about some nations that have bought supplies from China and had to send them back en masse because they are of poor quality material, the tests are only 5% accurate and so on.These occurrences are heard about, and what I don't know is how much is being supplied that is of good quality and with accurate testing devices. I hope a hell of a lot.The nations that have returned the items have tested them and found them to be wanting. My fear is that Zambia will not test these things themselves and accept that they are accurate and of good quality without anything further. ""Don't look a gift horse in the mouth"" etc. Plus possibly the fear of offence in rejecting them when Zambia is beholden to China for vast sums of money and cannot pay off their debts now, never mind if the loans are suddenly called in.So will the PPE's protect, will the masks be of a sufficient standard and will the tests be accurate?Answers I don't know.2) There is ""mass testing"", which is a good thing, but there are areas where there has been the virus detected and little or no testing has subsequently been done. Why? Because the Ministry of Health has not felt that that place is what they've called a 'hotspot'.Ndola for example.And this is the conundrum - without testing you have little idea of the extent of the infection - so you believe there to be little risk as there are few if any cases, thus it isn't deemed to be a hotspot and thus mass testing is not done and so you believe there to be little risk as there are few if any cases thus it isn't deemed to be a hotspot and thus mass testing is not done..... ad infinitum.Resources dictate the Zambian authorities can only be proactive to a limited amount and somewhere like Germany and other countries, who were able to test and test and test, showed the value of that, unlike somewhere like the UK who just couldn't seem to be bothered and to get their act together, I know many in authority in Zambia would love to do so, but a) they don't have enough to be able to and now b) are the resources/tests they do have, up to par?Questions, questions......."
"Good questions all. I've also read about these defective Chinese PPE/tests, but it seems that after the embarrassment, it's gotten better. According to US officials, we are all getting these things from China anyways.Do you know if the gov't is doing the diagnostic tests (nasal swab), or antibody tests (blood test)?And I'm assuming given current conditions, all safari operators are not going to open in May?"
I'll try and find out about the tests as I don't know. I just hear the word 'tests' and that's it.Safari operators - your guess I'm afraid is as good as mine.
The initial testing method is nasal.
"Zambia is up to 106 cases now, still only three deaths.There are 55 recovered and 48 active cases.Of the new cases, one is an Asian national who has come back to work and is in quarantine, three are truck drivers from SA, Namibia and Zimbabwe and the rest are contacts of known cases or people screened during targeted community and health care facility from Chipata compound , Chawama and Kanyama.Other news is that questions are now being asked as to the accountability of donated money, usually from other countries but an effort is being made to keep a grip on the spread by doing as much testing as they can - and it isn't just those associated with those infected or those entering the country. Teams are going into the Compounds and testing to the extent of the tests they have. For example yesterday 1780 tests were done in two of the compounds.Plus, another proactive action is 1st and 2nd May one of the designated hospitals is letting anyone come and be tested (yes, there will be queues but that is expected. Hopefully they will socially distance whilst waiting). Also the same at the following -1) Rhodes park mosque along Addis Ababa Road2)Airtel HQ car park3) International School of Lusaka Hall4) Kalemba Hall Church5) The Gallery office Park, car park next to cemetery, Lagos road6) Medland Hospital carparkI don't expect you'll know these places but I post it to illustrate what precautions are being taken. It does seem the efforts are all in Lusaka though and I do hope similar things are being done in other population centres.Other good news, but maybe bad news for some, is that Zambian Breweries (Mosi, Castle, Eagle beers amongst others) is and has reduced its production of beer to concentrate more on producing hand sanitizer.Edited: 5:40 pm, April 30, 2020 "
"Respect, Mark, for providing all these usefull info."
Well there are those that regularly go to Zambia and feel a connection with it so I felt a little more detail would be appropriate and appreciated.
"The Ministry of Health Zambia FB page seems very good for updates.I have to say that despite doom laden predictions from early on, Covid-19 doesn't seem to be hitting Africa too hard. Touch wood, I hope I do not speak too soon. But I have thought from the outset that it was very strange the virus didn't jump from China to Africa with the amount of traffic there is between China and Africa. Interesting article here on the subject-https:/…e9cf5ed0-a590-4bd6-8c00-b41d0c4ae6e0And a nice interview here with Grant Cummings, touching on the impact on the safari industry-https://www.instagram.com/p/B_cf1pVHwKY/…"
"Stokey and others as you may recall I'm an American physician. What would be called a GP I think in the UK. I'm of the opinion that sub Saharan Africa will experience quite a bit of coronavirus infection but relatively little death. Why? They're young. Only a small fraction of the population is over 65. In most countries deaths in the young are at nearly zero percent. Only 3.1% of Zambians are over 65 the highest risk group. Most are of an age where deaths are very unusual. I believe that is driving the lower numbers in less developed parts of the world. Lack of high tech health care is beside the point. The virus seems to kill who it is going to kill regardless at this time. And those people are the elderly and chronically ill almost exclusively. A demographic that is a tiny percentage of the population of Zambia and similar nations.Edited: 8:15 pm, May 01, 2020 "
"In my metropolitan area , Phoenix, 97% of those who have died from COVID-19 are over 65 or have a chronic illness(or both). The US percentage of people over 65 is 5 -6 times that of sub Saharan Africa and the rates of obesity related diseases like diabetes are much higher. Diabetics with heart disease generally don't become elderly in Africa. The demographic that is being killed just isn't a significant part of the population there. The younger people may have mild or no symptoms at all and likely are escaping notice.All just an educated guess to be sure and I hope it really does touch Africa lightly.Edited: 8:20 pm, May 01, 2020 "
"Yes, a young population is one of the possibilities mentioned in the article.If that's the case, it's entirely possible the disease did make it over from China months ago but has been making its way around undetected.Even in most Western countries, the statistics only show the worst cases of people who have actually had the virus- in the UK you only get tested and confirmed if you have it bad enough to be hospitalised, or perhaps if you are a healthcare worker or a celebrity. I know plenty of people who think they've had the virus (including me) and we don't form part of the statistics.All we can do is cross our fingers (or hold thumbs as they say locally) and hope that the low death toll continues."
"May 1st - 109 cases.May 2nd - 119May 3rd - 124May 4th - 137So it's gradually going up but as the first cases were on 18th March it's difficult to know if there are still many who haven't been detected yet by testing or there really are few infections. As it's only been in the last few days that the number of tests per day are reaching the high hundreds rather than three to four hundred and in comparison to many countries which are in the thousands per day, there is still that question.I am tentatively becoming optimistic because of the factors also listed in the last couple of posts plus after six weeks or so since the first infection and you would think that if there were a vast number of infected, they'd have been discovered by the number of deaths and hospital cases never mind from the tests.It does seem the majority who are known to be infected have come from the testing rather than what you might call 'walk ins' who were ill.We'll see."
"From a Twitter feed (#covid19zambia) -There are now 252 cases, a bit of a jump because of cases now known -Zambia's border town, Nakonde records 76 new cases of COVID-19 in just 24hrs.26 Truckers13 Sex Workers31 Immigration Staff and Clearing Agents02 Medics (Nurse and Clinical Officer)04 Contacts of positive.Fortunately still only 7 deaths."
"""Zambia sex workers praised for contact tracing.""https:/…world-africa-52604961"
I see they are closing the border with Tanzania today- it seems a lot of cases are being imported from Tanzania.
"Yes, at Nakonde.Presidential directive in effect from today.At the other end of the country at the Kazangula border post, the police made a convoy of 54 trucks and escorted them all the way to Lusaka so that the drivers were made sure of quarantining for 14 days.It's just that the country is so reliant on imports, closing all or some of the border posts, of which there are more than you can shake a stick at, is trying to be avoided, but as we can see, there is a cost and a risk to that."
"I have to say, following the Ministry of Health's FB updates, I am pretty impressed with Zambia's response to the whole Covid-19 situation. It all seems to be very transparent, with daily releases of figures and updates. They seem to be doing targeted testing and contact tracing. Bearing in mind they probably have more limited resources, they are putting some first world governments to shame.I am not surprised they have had to close the border with Tanzania- the Tanzanian government's strategy seems to be to stick their heads in the sand and pray."
Agree. I'm thinking cautiously positively (does that make sense?) about their actions.They certainly seem to have it together a lot more than many countries.
"It seems the latest positive tests could well be the thin edge of the wedge - in the same province there's been a bit of an explosion of infections. A further 126 in that province, 29 more in the Copperbelt and some others.Plus, the Ministry of Health offer the figure of ""174 COVID-19 cases out of the 338 tests performed on 9th and 10th May 2020.""What is somewhat startling is the ratio of tests to positives in that sample. maybe the tests were done only on those suspected or at high risk.Total cases are now 441.Edited: 11:48 am, May 12, 2020 "
"441! that's a big increase from last week!The test positive rate is very worrying. Going by US experience, in New York during the worst of the outbreak, positive rate was >25%. Supposedly it needs to be <10% to have an R (transmission rate) equal or less than 1. Otherwise you're in exponential growth.Best wishes to the Zambian people and everyone in Africa."
"For those who may have bookings in Zambia, the light at the end of the tunnel may well be the the President has issued a directive 'ordering' tourism operatives to open in Livingstone as he has ordered Vic Falls (Zambian side obviously) to be opened.https:/…"
"Mark- are the quarantine restrictions for arrivals from overseas still in place? I haven't seen any info about them being lifted. At the end of the article it mentions ""locals will start traveling now"" so I am guessing at least for the moment they are only expecting local tourism?It's a first step, for sure, and gives me some hope for my October trip."
"Yes, entry restrictions are still in place and the subsequent quarantine necessity.The choice they had is either to close the borders (as mooted now with Nakonde/Tanzania) or leave them open but quarantine those entering. The latter was chosen and even though it may be effective - though I'm still not absolutely sure but believe it to be so, that if you test negative you can leave the quarantine place - the main problem is not those people, but those who 'commute' between the country and Zambia - usually by just walking across to sell stuff either way. They are not readily being quarantined as far as I know.I have been a little busy the last couple of days and I need to get back to looking at the information more closely as to what is happening. I'll update if anything springs up.I also interpret what has been said as that locals will be able to book hotels now and stay and so on, but international travellers, as expected, will still have to abide by the isolation rules.I have no idea what percentage of 'stays' in Livingstone are purely locals but I can't see it really adding up to much and the money is made from foreigners.However, it is a first step."
"The explosion of cases at Nakonde (border with Tanzania) is still exploding.Now in total in the country there are 654 cases.There are 196 positives from Nakonde (from 554 tests) - truck drivers, port officials, health workers etc.There are 12 positives from truck drivers who entered at Chirundu (border with Zimbabwe and the most direct route from Harare).Cases -Nakonde now - 398Lusaka - 150Ndola - 22Chirundu - 22Kafue (town, not National Park by the way) - 20Kabwe - 16And then single figure numbers dotted around.As Stokey has pointed out previously, the Facebook page from the Ministry of Health is keeping a tally of the situation. Deaths fortunately still only 7."
"As I said, I'm still catching up with things but the Nakonde border has been closed."
....... and now it's open again.
"Hi, trying to get back home to malawi from zimbabwe. can anyone offer advice on likeihood of being able to drive chirundu to mchinji at the moment? Thanks"
"You have to undergo a mandatory 14 day quarantine on entering Zambia but there are no tourist visas being issued so one factor is what visa you'd need to get in. The border is open into Zambia and in simple terms -""Anyone entering Zambia, including returning residents, will undergo mandatory quarantine for a period of not less than 14 days at a government designated institution or facility at their own cost.Travellers to Zambia are not allowed to leave Zambia until they have completed the quarantine period. Quarantine is a mandatory requirement from the Zambian Ministry of Health.All tourist visas to Zambia have been cancelled.""No matter what the requirements/restrictions you may encounter to enter Malawi you may be able to argue you in in transit through Zambia and are a returning resident to Malawi, but I wouldn't count on that for being able to just drive through.Wearing of masks is compulsory when travelling, either on public transport or in your own vehicle.You'd also have to enquire individually regarding where to stay as many forms of accommodation are closed for now."
"Also, I'm sure you'll be asked at some point why you are going through Zambia when there are border crossings between Zim and Malawi."
@Mark604Thank you so much for your updates. I have a postponed trip to Zambia for next month and am waiting with baited breath for some good news on border openings. Need some dust on my boots.Take care all. Elaine
"Hi Elaine- I think we met in Kafue in 2018. Are you going back to Kafue?Regretably, I think next month (June) is over optimistic for Zambia. I am holding out some hope that my planned trip to Lower Zambezi in October might go ahead, but i've already moved a trip to South Luangwa at the end of June over to 2021."
"Now 761 cases.I've been looking from time to time at the reports from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. They are quite in-depth and informative but do tend to take a while to be updated.But, just to give you an idea of what information they are releasing, have a quick browse through the one for the 16th May.Yes, the figures are lagging behind, but - look at figure 4 on page 6. They are pinpointing within Nakonde where they have been testing and the result.I'm impressed with that in comparison to the waffling releases from some countries -znphi.co.zm/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/…"
"Also, there are maps of the infections in the country but they are somewhat vague. This is a bit better to give you an idea of the spread (hope the link works) -https:/…"
"Good morning @Stokeygirl.Yes, Kafue was the plan but it is not happening anytime soon. In Queensland we can only travel up to 150km from home and that distance does not even get me to the next town. Staying positive and hoping that Zambia and the rest of the world makes it through these times. Elaine."
Thanks again Mark604.
"Thanks, Mark for the great info! I check back daily for more.The map is reassuring. Looks like vast majority of the country has zero cases, and the health department seems to be doing a good job of contact tracing. Hope they can contain and crush the virus."
"""... Looks like vast majority of the country has zero cases, ....""Optimist - that's really good!Pessimist - maybe there aren't any because few if any tests have been done in those areas to detect them.I'm sitting on the fence."
"Yeah, but you'd think that people would notice if hospitals and clinics started filling up with pneumonia cases.It does also occur to me that perhaps the virus is more more widespread, but just not causing serious symptoms or deaths, so it is spreading undetected. This could be because of the factor of a younger population with some resistance to respiratory illnesses.It seems like a lot of cases are being found through routine testing at the borders and contact tracing. But I wonder how sick all those who tested positive actually are? The number of deaths still remains at 7.If it is the case that the disease is more widespread but not causing much harm then that's great news for Zambians, not so great for tourists. Let's face it, the demographic of safari tourists is skewed towards the elderly and they could still catch it from asymptomatic locals."
Not that i know of - it's zambia or moz - do you knopw if its possible to book a quarantine period at a lodge or hotel?
"Ruth, yes it is possible in Zambia.If you look back at my post at number 57, there is a link to a PDF document. The last page, page 15, has a list of approved places.There are others not on that list but I can't give you any details of them other than their names -Fringilla LodgeMilanga VillageKwitu LodgeFleur de LysWesu Executive LodgeFox LodgeFatmolsTecla Lodge and HotelsSkyway LodgeMika LodgeI tend to think a number of them are quite local places and may not have the facilities some of us are used to, nor possibly the catering side of things."
"Thanks, this is helpful. Does that mean we'd be allowed to drive through from Chirundu to one of these lodges in Lusaka?Do we have to stay the full 2 weeks, or only until our test results are shown to be negative/"
"In answer to if you can travel to Lusaka - no idea. I can tell you that there have been convoys led by the police of trucks ensuring they quarantine in Lusaka, but an independent traveller? Don't have a clue if you'd be allowed to or must quarantine at the border of entry, but as Chirundu is the closest border entry to Lusaka, I'd expect so.In any case, no matter what I say, I'm just some anonymous person on the internet and I suggest you contact directly the relevant Zambian authorities.As far as I know, yes, if you get a negative result, you are allowed to move on - but I am aware of many returning residents who have had to wait a week and more for a result.But that leads me to the big question as the answer to this makes the rest just moot points - what visa are you entering on?You are not a resident/citizen, so again, you need to find out from an official source if you are allowed to enter in the first place - all tourist visas are so far not being issued, but there are other types of visa - you'd need to find out. A transit visa is I think just for 7 days, but you'd need to commit to being in the country for 14 days - the length of the official quarantine period, no matter you may get an earlier test result, it's still a commitment of 14 days. So I doubt you'd get a transit visa.You need to research into that aspect regarding if you need a visa or not depending on if you may be one of the visa free countries allowed access anyway.By the way, my mistake in a previous post about Zim and Malawi sharing a border. For some reason I was thinking of Moz.After all that long answer, in a nutshell - my opinion counts for nothing when you are facing an Immigration official. Ask the right (official) people. If they reply in writing and it is favourable, print it and take it with you."
"Forgot to mention, there is a possibility for entry if your travel is deemed 'essential'. Officially the borders are closed for 'non-essential travel'."
"Plus eleven yesterday and plus sixty today - total now 832.Nakonde (50), Ndola (8), Chirundu (4), Kitwe (1), Kasama (1), Isoka (1), Mpulungu (1), Senga (1), Solwezi (1), Kasama (1), Isoka (1) and Mungwi (1).Edited: 2:50 pm, May 20, 2020 "
Thank you Mark for taking the time to update us.Zambia is landlocked and is heavily reliant on imports by road from Dar es Salaam and Durban. Closing the Nakonde borders is financial suicide. On the other hand controlling the spread of the virus is priority. I've seen the figures from Nakonde. A tough one indeed. We're still planning a trip for 2022 in the hope that things are better here in the UK as we do not want to spread the virus to others.Stay safe all x
"President Lungu to address the nation this afternoon at 4pm.I really don't know what to expect. Maybe further clamp down, or following Tanzania in opening up..........let's wait and see! This will be live on TV. Hopefully it will be live on the Ministry of Health FB page as well."
Interesting. We'll see what he has to say.
"Well, tried to watch it but maybe it's my computer, but couldn't make out a word he was saying. I've had to wait to see if there has been a report of anything of note.It appears the only item affecting ""us"" is that those who are asymptomatic (have it but show no signs) be allowed to continue their quarantine at home - monitored, but at home, instead of waiting the full 14 days to expire.He says it is so those aren't exposed to further infection.The first details I've seen are here -https:/…Again, if I notice anything else important cropping up, I'll try and get back to mention it."
"As from yesterday there are now 920 cases detected.Bullet points from the President's speech -20,011 testsAdvancement into cold season will see rise in flu and associated illnesses● Proprietors of lodges and hotels encouraged to open their establishments as long as they follow health guidelines including social distancing,mask,hand washing & sanitising.● Owners of Bars & Nightclubs have not been forgotten,your outlets will be open once consultations are finished on how to deal with guidelines.● Citizens tested positive but asymptomatic to be allowed to self isolate at home.Only those symptomatic & with underlying conditions must be quarantined.● Education & Health Ministers to adequately prepare for examination classes.● I urge digital service providers to make their products affordable● Public sector urged to operate at optimum level● K 10 Billion Covid stimulus package to assist SMEs● Thanks organisations including media houses for sensitisation.● Do not stigmatised those with Covid19 as it can affect everyone● MOH to hold press briefings on Monday & Fridays so as to focus on fighting the pandemic"
What about foreigners entering the country? Still no visa?
Still no tourist visas as far as I know. Not heard of a change in that yet.
"One thing in the President's speech is that from that date, updates will only be given on Mondays and Fridays. I had hoped they'd still release the day to day figures but with no other details.Well, it seems they don't even do that - or at least none that I can find.The last figures are from Friday 22nd May - 920 cases and 7 deaths. Monday came and went and as it was a Bank Holiday (Africa Day) no update was given. It is now Wednesday and it won't be until Friday then when something will be released.A lot can happen in a week."
"Yes, I'd noticed the lack of updates from the MOH FB page."
"Wow. New update today- 137 new cases out of over 4000 tests, but 443 recoveries!So they are now on 1057 cumulative cases, 779 recoveries and 7 deaths. Only 271 active cases.And the Health Minister has tested positive. Hope he's OK."
"I've just seen that.It's been reported that there is no longer a need upon arrival to quarantine at a government authorised hotel/lodge/hospital as the Chief Medical Officer has said a few days ago -*UPDATE: QUARANTINE* Self Isolation Allowed as of Monday 25th.1. You will be interviewed at the airport and asked about your home conditions to ensure that they are ""ideal"" for you to safely and totally isolate yourself away from other members of the household for 14 days.2. There will be spot checks.3. Those needing to leave Lusaka can *only* do so by road. Home conditions apply as well.4. Tested upon arrival.It is known that there have been flights arriving whereby the passengers are able to do this."
137 out of 4000 new tests is only 3% positive rate. That would be very good news!Best wishes for getting things under control. I hope they announce when they will start re-issuing tourist visas. Anyone knows if/when Proflight will operate again?
"They have a few repatriation flights running, Lusaka to Johannesburg or back, I think 5th and 19th June and a restricted service to Ndola but I think nothing much will be happening until the end of June.You just need to keep checking their website and facebook pages.That's as much as I know."
They have a declaration on a Saturday the updates will only be from then on a Monday and a Friday.They miss the next Monday because it is a bank holiday but publish some figures on the Wednesday.The Friday comes and no figures. Saturday they say they'll update on Monday.Oh dear.
"Latest update looks positive. Only 32 new cases out of 3,361 tests.133 recoveries. No more deaths."
Looking good then. I've not had time to check today. Thanks.
I was expecting a Friday update from the Ministry of Health or elsewhere by now.Like they promised but I think only once so far has it been on the day they said.We'll see later or tomorrow then.
"Nope, still no update that I can find anywhere.As an aside, there's lots of first hand reports and as usual, rumours flying around.Reports from those who have been flying back in to the country. The procedure is they are tested on arrival, go home to quarantine for 14 days and await the results. If it comes back negative they are allowed out. If positive they have to be taken to a government facility for isolation. If they do not display any symptoms they are released.Well yes, they are tested on arrival but nobody is getting a result back. Nobody has said they have had one back for many, many weeks. One man has been 39 days without a result. After 14 days he did decide anyway to resume 'normal' life. He and others still waiting after many days and weeks have contacted the health authorities and have been told there is a backlog. One person says they were told in confidence during a phone to call them that actually the tests are not being examined for a result to be obtained as they've no chemicals left or not enough left to do so.Rumours are that they are saving the tests for other areas and/or they've run out and the ones on people arriving are dummy tests plus they've no tests left because they've sold them all to someone else etc etc."
"That would explain the lack of updates on new cases, if testing has stalled due to lack of resources."
"Managed to track something down.The source is information from ""Lusaka Helps"" which was set up specifically to gather and disseminate information about the virus in Zambia. I have been looking at this for some time but not in the last couple of days.They do have a general update every week -""Weekly update on the epidemic in ZambiaNOTE: This week GRZ reduced the frequency of its COVID press updates. But daily figures are still being released in certain fora and Lusaka Helps is able to share these.How many positives?* As of June 4th total documented cases in Zambia are 1,152 whilst documented deaths have risen since last week, from 7 to 10. apparently all patients remaining under isolation are ""stable"".How many tests?  The number of test samples being processed has increased from around 800 per day to around 1,500 per day.  This is no doubt down to the opening of additional testing facilities (from the original two to eight now) and the use of new testing technologies.  Total number of tests processed is now above 30,000. That equates to about 1.6 tests per thousand people (although this does not account for the fact that some of the tests may be multiple ones done on the same person).How many deaths? Africa CDC and WHO show Zambia as having 7 documented COVID deaths, but figures released yesterday indicate there have been 3 more deaths this week, bringing the total to 10.  The CFR is the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases. In Zambia the CFR (prior to the recent 3 deaths) was 0.63%, considerably lower than the likes of Italy (14%) or Germany (4%) or even South Africa (2.34%). How many recoveries? Zambia has 944 recoveries according to MOH communique June 4th.""https:/…"
Thanks Mark.It doesn't sound like the situation is getting any worse.
"The testing situation sounds concerning. We went through a similar period in California where the backlog of tests reached 100's thousands and it took > 2 weeks to get results back. The issue was a bottleneck at one of the labs as well as a lack of chemicals. There were also reporting problems, as only positive results were reported by the labs, so those who tested negative never got an answer.This took California a long time to resolve, so I can imagine the challenges in Zambia. Thank you for the updates."
"111 new cases out of 8,805 tests in last 7 days.I have to say, I'm starting to lose perspective on whether numbers are good or bad. Especially when here in the UK, yesterday's figure of ""only"" 77 deaths (and over 1300 new cases) is considered a great result. But then we're doing 150,000 tests a day.My brain hurts."
You need to go on a safari and clear out the cobwebs.
"Does anyone have any news of whether road travel through chirundu is now possible - with testing and waiting in a lodge in Lusaka for the result I presume? What about crossing the road border if you already have a negative COVID test certificate?We are still trying to get back to Malawi from Zimbabwe - 12 weeks now......Edited: 3:49 am, June 11, 2020 "
I see that Emirates are showing flights from Dubai to Lusaka from August 29th. My dreams may come true or I still live in hope.
"Yes, I received a newsletter from Remote Africa Safaris a few days ago which included this: A two week quarantine is still required for international arrivals but we anticipate a change regarding this fairly soon. Ethiopian Airlines continue to fly into Lusaka several times a week and Emirates have announced a return to inbound flights into Lusaka from August.I'm actually seeing flights as early as 1 Aug- but not every day of the week- looks like 4 days a week to start with.So I'm feeling more positive about my October trip, but trying not to count my chickens..........."
"Chickens 1, 2 3 @stokeygirl"
It should be guinea fowl really I suppose.
"The President announced yesterday the re-opening of international airports. As the stated aim was to boost foreign tourism, then I assume they are going to have to start issuing tourist visas again and also drop the 14 day self quarantine requirement. Otherwise opening the airports isn't going to bring back tourism.https:/…In any case, things are moving in a positive direction."
"That's great news. I wonder if they will restrict travelers from certain regions. At this point, if I were the President of Zambia, I would definitely not allow anyone from the US, as our debacle continues."
"Well that’s interesting news ! Things are moving on at last.However, I heard today that my TA has postponed our August trip to the same time next year ( as expected) Also , my travel insurance company has decided to cover clients medical expenses abroad and repatriation if needed for Covid19 related illness, which is reassuring. Fingers crossed this virus disappears and doesn’t recur."
"Perhaps they are indeed considering which countries to let in and which not. There may be a further announcement about visas.The US does sound like it's nowhere near over the worst. But it's such a big country that the virus seems to be moving its epicentre around the country in the same way it did around Europe. So it sounds like New York is way past the worst and has it under control whereas in Florida and Arizona it's only just getting going. In Europe though, even the worst hit countries (like us in the UK) seem to be well on the road to recovery. But Zambia gets a lot of tourists from Europe and probably fewer from the US than, say, Botswana or Tanzania. So even if they only open up to tourists from Europe (and other places that are over the worst) it will make a difference. Due to the seasonal nature of most of the camps, they really need to get some tourists in before October for it to be worth it.Sarah- I think August might be just about possible but postponing is probably the safer option. You can always wait and see how things go and if it is possible and you fancy it you could try and move the trip to this October at the last minute. October is very hot in Zambia but the game viewing is excellent. It's worth considering.That's good news about your insurance too. Although I think flying to Zambia would be the riskiest part as far as catching the virus goes. In Zambia itself, the parks are in quite remote and isolated parts of the country- I don't think Mfuwe has had any cases at all. I suppose there will be other tourists and how risky that will be I guess depends on whether Zambia limits entry from some countries or not.But a lot can change in 2-3 months. It already feels like a never ending struggle, but if you think about it, lock down here in the UK only started 3 months ago and look how far we have come. In another 3 months, we could be home and dry or hitting a second wave. We can only watch and wait."
Does anyone know the current status of the 14 day quarantine? Is it still in force? is there any news when it will be relaxed? I am looking at when I can do a trip from the UK for business.
"I am a little bit confused at the moment because although they have re-opened international airports with the stated aim being to restart tourism, I haven't seen any official information that either the 14 day self quarantine has been lifted or that tourist visas are being issued."
"I've just seen this in a newsletter from a safari camp operator-""COVID-19 ZAMBIAOn the 25th of June, His Excellency Dr Edgar Chagwa Lungu, declared all of Zambia's airports open for business! Although the specifics of visas and quarantine protocols are still to be finalised, the country is being encouraged to embrace the 'new normal' and open borders while taking necessary precautions. We will share more news as soon as we receive it.""So I haven't missed something, they are still working on it. I wonder whether they are going to be selective initially about allowing visitors from different countries."
"I have been searching for anything more up to date, but nothing more than the statement from the 25th June. The Zambia Tourism web site has the article in their news section and the implication is that you will be tested and only need to quarantine if you get a positive result. it would be good to find something certain though."
"I just receive this from Smart Traveller (the Australian Government site) If you're entering Zambia, you're required to undergo mandatory testing and quarantine for at least 14 days in a designated institution or facility at your own cost. You won't be allowed to leave Zambia until the mandatory quarantine period has been completed. Face masks must be worn in public. All international airports are now open but tourist visa arrangements have not yet been specified. There are reports that land borders are being closed to non-essential traffic, with little or no notice. If you're in Zambia and wish to return to Australia, be aware that the Australian Government has placed caps on the number of passengers and flights into each capital city. You should consult your travel agent or airline for the latest information. The Australian Embassy in Harare continues to provide limited consular services.We advise:Do not travel to Zambia.Maybe next year."
"Elaine- yes that is still the current situation, although I am hearing from safari operators that they do expect this to change soon. After all, the President did state the aim of opening the airports was to restart tourism, and you can't do that unless you start re-issuing tourist visas and stop quarantine requirements. I think Emirates flights restart in August.For me personally, I've had a different spanner thrown in the works of my plans, in that Tusk and Mane, with whom I was due to spend 6 out of my 9 safari nights, have decided not to bother opening this season as they have so few remaining bookings. So I am working on rescheduling for next year anyway.I am still waiting for news, as if travel to Zambia is possible in October I will still go, but I will have to make a new plan."
"I have rescheduled my Zambia trip from early to mid September this year to 2021. Due to 2021 already being heavily booked, I had to move my postponed trip from early September (this year) to early October (next year), as September was already getting close to full. Obviously everyone is moving to 2021 due to Covid and availability at the camps is already sparse for next year (my camps were Shenton's and Chiawa/Old M). My operator did say that if things do open up, camps with availability this October would be more than pleased to move the trip back to 2020 at no charge. Of course, even if this does happen, there are still issues to be worked out. For example, in Canada at least, if one is returning from international travel, they will have to quarantine upon their return for 14 days at home. This will potentially create issues for many due to not being able to return to work in a timely fashion. So still complicated and 2021 is looking more likely..."
"1flagg- yes, I think this is becoming an issue for rescheduling trips with camps filling up.I would also have to quarantine on return from Zambia (for 2 weeks) under the UK's current rules. Luckily for me, my job is one I can do from home and I have been for the last 4 months! Even if we are back in the office by October, I wouldn't foresee a problem with 2 weeks working from home again. And the UK rules could change by then too.I know a lot of people like to plan ahead but it is amazing what can be achieved at short notice.In March, I could see the coronavirus situation getting worse and the likelihood of my planned trip to Tanzania in April decreasing. So I called my tour operator and asked if bringing my trip forward was a possibility. Two days later I was on a plane, and I just managed to complete my trip and get back home on the first day of UK lockdown. I am now in a similar position to you, in that my October trip will now be moved to 2021, and cannot be moved back as the camp isn't opening. But I do have the option of moving my June/July trip which is already rescheduled to 2021, back to October this year. And that is what I might end up doing, even if it's at very short notice."
"Thanks for your comments and information Stokeygirl. I am considering something similar, as I have the ability to work from home if needed as well. I am hopeful that things will open up soon in Zambia. October this year sounds so much better than October of 2021! My flights are with Emirates to Lusaka, and it appears they will be flying again there soon. So it's a watch and wait situation with the Zambian 14 day quarantine. If that is waived, then there could be options for this year, with a little flexibility. I'm hopeful that something can change, as the local communities surrounding the camps are struggling without tourism, and apparently poaching is becoming a bigger problem. It's such a complicated balancing act..."
"Well, if we both make it in October, I might see you there- my trip will include some time at Shentons."
Very worrisome situation in the whole of Southern Africa from today's WHO briefing.https:/…1285225893103796229
It does look as if things might have taken a turn for the worse in Zambia in the last week or two.
"Seems like it will be hard for Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana to escape COVID if it's growing uncontrolled in South Africa :("
"To be fair, Zambia is quite a way from South Africa and is not really considered to be in Southern Africa. Not by bird books anyway. Traffic between Zambia and South Africa right now is probably very limited, and I doubt South Africa is the source of the Zambian infections. The geographic distribution of cases suggests more has been imported from neighbouring Tanzania. Of course, their reaction to the virus has just been to pretend it doesn't exist, stop testing and issue no figures, so no one really knows the extent of the crisis there. But the fact Zambian cases are on the increase this way makes me think twice about going to Tanzania, even if right now it's about the only safari country allowing tourists in."
"I think avoiding travel just about anywhere is a good idea this year. The virus is likely to be quite prevalent in Africa. That would make it risky for a tourist. I still think per capita death and disability from the virus will be low for sub Saharan Africa because of demographics. More than 60% of the population is of an age that just is barely impacted by the virus. For the small part of their population at risk though it may be devastating due to the lack of healthcare infrastructure. I tried to find out what Zambia had in the way of ICU beds. I found one study from 2015 showing a total of 5 ICU beds in the country all in Lusaka. That's for over 17 million people. My state, Arizona with 7.4 million people has 1522 and the ability to expand that by 50% with surge capacity in emergencies. Fortunately we haven't come close to having to do that yet. The difference in healthcare between the developed and underdeveloped countries is shockingly stark and tragic. I hope I'm correct about demographics and that Africa and Zambia can somehow protect their vulnerable. They will not get adequate care if infected."
I should note that what I meant about risky for a tourist is because of access to care. We're as likely or more likely to get the virus in the US and the UK as we would be in Africa. The issue is should you be sick enough to need care you're going to have to be evacuated at least to South Africa if not home delaying that care. Always a risk anyway I suppose given the same is true for other illnesses and accidents.
"I've just received some info from a camp operator in Zambia that tourist visas are now being issued. There is also a requirement to have a negative Covid test result within ""the previous 14 days"" (for safety I'd assume before arrival). Sorry I can't link, as it was sent as a pdf document. But I am sure this info will soon filter down to things like the UK FCO advice (which has been pretty quick to pick up changes for Kenya and Tanzania).I believe Emirates delayed the start of flights from August to September but at least Ethiopian and Rwanda Air are currently operating. Not sure if Emirates will come back as a daily service or a reduced service to start with."
"Interesting news! Maybe things are starting to get back to normal a bit ? I had an email from a camp in Zambia to say they won’t be opening up this year after all due to Covid19 travel complications . They had been planning to open in September. Shame. Looking at the Emirates website, it looks a bit complicated getting the testing done in the right timeframe and certified etc. It seems to differ depending on the country you’re going to too. Not that Emirates are flying to Zambia at the moment anyway . Good Luck with your travel plans !"
"I've just had a chat to my TO and I think Zambia is just going to be too complicated. As you say, some camps have given up and won't open, but the main issue is Proflight- they're now down to 2 flights a week in each direction making it a scheduling nightmare.The testing requirement (14 days) is actually the least of my concerns. I've been looking at Kenya as an alternative and they require a test 96 hours before departure. That is a pain, but compared to Zambia it does have the benefit of being a direct 8 hour flight and the plan I'm considering requires no internal flights. So from a contact/safety perspective and a logistics perspective it's better."
"Thanks, Stokeygirl, for the update. And good luck with your next trip.I'm also looking now at Kenya as our next destination, but only at the end of the year."
"I'm looking at late Sept, and just going to the Laikipia area. Possibly Samburu.Proflight have released their schedule, or at least A schedule for next year, and even for dry season 2021 it's reduced compared to normal. I am hoping they are just being conservative and will add more flights when the situation becomes clearer because the schedule they have released is going to create problems with my deferred trips- the flight to/from Mfuwe that connect with Emirates are no longer every day. With so many deferred trips, if travel is back to normal by June 2021, then it has the potential to be a busier than usual season, so I hope an expansion of the schedule will come at some point.If anyone is still planning to try and get to Zambia this season for safari, I'd say it will still be possible but you'll have to be flexible, and any itinerary you already have planned is likely to have to change. Reduced flight schedules will make South Luangwa and Lower Zambezi trickier. Kafue by road might be the easiest option. But one other issue is going to be that I'm hearing an increasing number of camps say they are not going to open this season because they have so few (or no) remaining bookings. I was booked with Tusk and Mane who already made the decision not to operate this season a few weeks ago.  Someone I'm in touch with had a combination of Old Mondoro, Mwamba and Musekese planned for Oct and they've been told of those three only Musekese is going to be open. Chiawa is probably not going to open, and I'm not sure if Shentons are only opening Kaingo and not Mwamba or nothing at all. I've seen Musekese mention in their newsletter that they've been allowing their Busanga Plains bush camp site to be used by local self drivers for the season so I'm assuming they haven't set that up.So sadly, I think this opening up has come too late for many operators to salvage anything from this season. I'm seeing a lot of residents offers being advertised and the current Proflight schedule (Lusaka to Mfuwe on Sat morning, back on Monday afternoon) is obviously aimed at the local market.For me, I am hoping I might be able to get a green season trip to South Luangwa in March."
"Just popped in to confirm what Stokey said a few posts ago that tourist visas are now being issued.The PDF link is below.Tourists are allowed to go about their safaris, travels etc without quarantine period if they have a negative test result issued somewhere in the previous 14 days -https://www.zacl.co.zm/application/files/471…"
The changes have filtered through to the FCO advice-https:/…entry-requirementsAlthough I note they say you need to get a visa in advance. I can't see that anywhere in the announcement above.
"All the information I have and can find is that the visa on arrival system is operative. It has been that you had to apply in advance for an interim period, but I know of, for example, a travel agency who said the day before yesterday - ""our runner was turned away from MOH this morning when he went to do the normal pre-approval applications. They told him visas will be issued at the airport from now on."" and others who have arrived and just got a VOA.There is the off chance that an airline may turn you away because they don't know still that a VOA is ok.It would need looking into for anyone who is planning to arrive soon."
"Yeah, I'm not planning this year- hoping now for March.For anyone who is, the other thing I found out today is that Emirates is requiring a test for anyone on a flight to Dubai, even if in transit. So that means you'd need one on the way back as well as out. Not very practical for tourists.https:/…"
"Stokeygirl, in response to your concerns about the situation in Tanzania- I’m here right now, have been here since the country opened (1 July), travelled all over the place - big part of it was public transport - it’s much safer here covid-wise than anywhere in Europe god forbid the US.In Zanzibar it’s like nothing ever happened. Arusha is a bit more serious (good!), but still everything is absolutely normal.True, not a good idea on the government part to stop sharing the information, but what I’ve seen with my own eyes over the past several weeks is that it’s definitely safe.One park - Mahale - requires a covid test for each visitor to protect their chimps (fair point!). Temperature checks at most of the hotels, and compulsory hand washing stations.It feels good and safe here. Already planning the December trip, with overland you Zambia and Zimbabwe."
"Hmmm, I'm not really convinced that ""feeling safe"" and being safe are the same thing. Someone could walk through a field and say it feels perfectly safe, without knowing it's a minefield. There might in fact have been a 75% chance of getting blown up walking through that field, but ignorance and luck in combination made it feel perfectly safe. I am keen to go on safari this year, but that doesn't mean I am completely oblivious to the risk of travel.  I'd like to weigh up the risks and come up with a plan that minimises those risks. The problem with Tanzania is that there is no data or information to judge what risk there is. And one person's experience is not data it's an anecdote.I am not saying I wouldn't go to Tanzania, although for sure I wouldn't go there and travel around on public transport. I looked into options for going to Tanzania, but there are logistical issues- camps I want to go to being closed, flights that won't run for only one passenger, and a poor selection of indirect flights that will get me there. All that, in combination with the lack of information about Covid made me decide that in the end Kenya seems like a safer bet, so fingers crossed that is where I'm going at the end of September. But it's a carefully considered plan- I have a direct flight, private road transfers to and from Nairobi, and I am spending 12 nights in only two camps in remote areas. Those two camps will probably have very few guests, so overall I am comfortable with the risk. In the same way that I am comfortable going on walking safaris, which I would never tell anyone were perfectly safe because they are not, there is an element of risk.Everyone is free to judge what level of risk they personally are comfortable, and if someone wants to go to Tanzania and travel round on public transport, that's absolutely fine by me. But please don't tell other people it's ""definitely safe"".Whatever I choose to do, I wouldn't want anyone else to follow me blindly with no consideration for the risks. And that will be different for everyone. What is an acceptable risk for me might not be for someone 30 years older. I have been on several safaris with my parents and would love to again but I wouldn't encourage them to come with me this time."
"My August 2020 trip has been pushed to June 2021, with the Zambia portion June 29-July 6Have already been notified of a schedule change for ProFlight Zambia LUN-MFU both directions. Actually is convenient for the return but problematic for the outbound. Travel company is working on extending one day and awaiting hearing availability at one camp.Hopeful things will be safe enough for travel next June"
"Yes, the Proflight schedule even for dry season next year has not as many flights as normal. It's also not convenient for my rescheduled trips, but I'm hoping they will add in more flights nearer the time."
Has anyone entered Zambia recently? I am wondering what sort of COVID test they accept. Would one of the NHS emails (whatever that looks like) be adequate? Blagging a free NHS test would be preferable to paying £150.
"I've just rebooked my cancelled trip to Zambia for next May, fingers crossed. We had to change the dates slightly as due to the reduced Proflight schedule we could not get from Mfuwe to Vic Falls on the day we were supposed to, but it's all now rebooked. I really hope things are OK by then as we had been planning this trip for almost 2 years. We got to 7 weeks before, and Covid struck. We were all gutted. We don't like to get too excited about next year!"
