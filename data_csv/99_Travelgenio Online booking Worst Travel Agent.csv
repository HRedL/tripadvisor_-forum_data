"Worst travel agent ever. ! Travelgenio is impossible to deal with. They do not answer their phones or emails and basically ignore their customers. I am trying to cancel some flights with QANTAS and VIRGIN AUSTRALIA for a credit which is policy of both these airlines, but Travelgenio ignores my request (My flight is tomorrow !!!!!!. I have been trying to contact them for the last 3 weeks), which means that I will end up losing $4000 worth of flights. JUST DON'T PURCHASE ANYTHING THROUGH THEM. THEY ATTRACT THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH A LOWER PRICE BUT OFFER NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL."

"Caroline, they are not a travel agent. They are just online ticket floggers. They do not have access to cheaper tickets. Did you pay them using a credit card? Can you see your booking if you go to the Qantas web page?"
"Travelgenio is based in Spain, and that country is in total lockdown. There is almost nobody on their staff who is able to get to work."

If the operators have cancelled the flights then depending on the terms of the carriers she may be eligible for a refund, but that would have to be processed by useless Travelgenio, who may not get around to doing anything for the next three or four months.Given the impossibility of reaching Travelgenio, has Caroline thought of contacting her credit card issuer to deal with them? We may never know."
"Their prices may sometimes be less than with the airline but have you ever thought why? The don't have the overhead of a Help Desk or Support Staff, they don't always include luggage and buy if possible, the basic, not refundable fares, By buying through a 3rd party you are now subject to Travelgenio Terms and Conditions which mean s that you have agreed to them possibly charging you a high cancellation fee even if they get the full refund from the airline plus other hidden nasties. But you agreed to these terms and Conditions"
"Caroline, why on earth would you purchase domestic flights through a third-party ticket seller rather than directly with the airlines? All of the flights that I had booked with QF and VA (even Tiger) have been proactively cancelled by the airline and vouchers/credits issued without any dramas. I’d suggest checking your flights on-line to see if there actually still operating, given almost all flights have been cancelled."
Hello Caroline. Please tell us your booking number or send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your reference and explaining what queries you have so we can get you an answer. Thank you. INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"[Ticket #3439849] My journey from Indore to Muscat by flight number AI 985 [Ticket #3439849] booking Code N7RK5L on 17 March 2020 came to a steady stop at Mumbai Airport after Air India canceled the flight from Mummbai to Muscat, Oman. The airline has announced that they will provide a full refund of the ticket.However, upon contacting the airline, they have asked us to contact travelgenio to facilitate a full refund.I'd also like to add that my booking was completed with cancellation protection plan which costed over 3000/-Despite repeated reminders there is no assurance yet when the refund will be made."
Hi Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards

"I have been so disappointed with their service @travelgenio has such terrible customer service, it’s actually nonexistent as no one answers, all I want to do is get an update on my refund or just get a reply, I understand there is a backlog but I have been waiting forever and have am worried my money won’t be returned. Not worth booking with them even if you do save some money because you end up spending all this time and energy trying to contact them"
That sadly is the risk you took when chasing the cheapest ticket possible through a firm you clearly didn't research properly

"Jordana, I'm afraid it's unrealistic to expect much in the way of service and support from most of these online ticket floggers. Even without a global pandemic and associated lockdowns, they cannot afford to invest much in back office, non revenue generating functions.Add in the current crisis, and I think that Travelgenio's customers will be waiting months rather than weeks for anything to happen.It's too late now, but I hope you'll remember in future that booking direct means there's no useless middleman in between you and the supplier. This will inevitably make refunds quicker, and no doubt customer service will be much better too."
"I am waiting on someone from Travelgenio to contact me. I have called to no avail, no one answers, no one contacts me. I was meant to fly out on 17th March-22nd April. The website says that one of my flights is cancelled and the other is confirmed. How is this possible, if I haven't left yet and flights have been cancelled? I have requested a refund from the airlines, but because I booked through a 3rd party, Travelgenio, they said that it was Travelgenio that needed to refund my ticket. I was travelling with a friend so we both need refunds. I am extremely disappointed with the service we have NOT received at all...Please contact me asap as we have no idea what is going to happens with our refund."
"Oh, do read the thread before you post. For example, look at reply #17 and get some realistic expectations. Spain is in total lockdown, and there will be almost nobody in Travelgenio's offices."
"Sydney is right, Lilly. There are answers in this thread from TravelGenio as well as answers from them in the eighty other threads about them here.They’ve been a known problem agency here at TA for many years, but at least they are replying to their customers here, as opposed to most of the other agencies that are ignoring inquiries."
"Hi Lilly, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules Please contact us via the contact section of our site and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
