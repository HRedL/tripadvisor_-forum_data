"Is it safe to visit Bali? Who knows? There is much debate on some other posts in this forum that are worth reading. However, you should undertake some independent research, starting with the World Health Organisation , your government’s travel advisories and weigh up any predisposing risk factors re your own health. It might be worth a discussion with your own doctor as well."
"Your condition of health are number one. As common human flu, Covid-19 are also caused by virus. If you in good healthy condition, you will safe at least from common human flu. There are tend that Covid-19 will be as common human flu."
"As Bailey suggests, do not look to this forum for answers on safety. Look for reliable and factual information from the WHO etc."
Post #2 is not a medical expert. Please ignore this “advice “. Cheers
"while my country is still safe from the corona virus, so it's still safe to travel...happy holiday in paradise island :)"
"Hi PrakasWe are only ordinary travellers, just like you, so it would not be appropriate or sensible for any of us to give you advice about health issues. I can understand that you struggle to make your own decisions, but in this case that is exactly what you will have to do. Do be aware however that this virus is also in your own country, therefore you have to think about where you would be safest."
"Do not believe with who tell he/she is expert in tourism, maybe he/she has vested interest in tourism businesses."
"I don’t understand what you’re talking about, Sarwa. Please explain."
"Travelkat, Sarwa is just taking potshots because he dislikes his “advice” being questioned."
TravelKat is offering the best advice that you will get from this forum. Do not rely on information you get here to base your decision on safety.
