Hi.Hello again from lovely and quite lindos beach at the dolphins. Arrived yesterday no problems at either airports and just 98 passengers on flight from Stansted. So today we have as expected clear blue skies sand that is roasting. No breeze and a temperature of 38.2 at 1pm. Till tomorrow. Enjoy. Peter
Thanks Peter I always look forward to your reports. Enjoy your stay. Lyn
Hi lyn.Many thanks for that something covid-19 cant change is the wonderful lindos sunshine.Peter.
Great to hear your weather reports peter and now look forward to our visit next month and by the way it's raining here in the north east.Andy
"Oh wow that’s hot. Thx v. much for update, we’ll be in Pefkos next Monday. Presumed bars/restaurants are now taking card payment rather than cash??"
"Thanks for that, feels a little more like normality resuming with your weather reports!"
Cash still being widely accepted.
Hi.I only have cash and it's not a problem. Peter.
"Looking forward to your updates Peter having missed our visit in June ☹️. Hope the village isn’t too quiet and the local businesses are doing ok...til next year for us now.,,,"
"Oh how I’ve missed your weather reports! Sounds wonderful, have a great time"
Hi.So here we go for another update on the weather. So it's no surprise that we have clear blue skies once again. Main beach by dolphins is busy but lots of empty beds. Was talking to George my sunbed guy he would normally have 50 umbrellas but because of social distancing he is only allowed 15 and still some empty. So at 1pm with have a temperature of 35.8 oops 9 just went up.Thanks for your kind replies. Till tomorrow. Enjoy. Peter
Hiya Peter. Hopefully I will be using George's sunbeds in September. For my first day I will be on the beach on my own until my friend arrives the next day so will only need one bed. Were you charged for just the one bed or did you have to pay for the twoThanksAnnie
"Loving your updates, thanks Peter. We’re there 11th August and can’t wait, you have helped with the little anxiety we had."
"Lovely updates, thank you.We are heading to Rhodes town beginning of August. Our first time. Will take a trip to Lindos though. The dolphin beach you are referring to, is there actual dolphins to be seen? Is it worth a trip out?"
Hi Annieb. I only pay 5 euros for a single bed. But I've known them all many years like yourself so I would say youShould be ok as your there everyday. But I've seen single travellers get charged 10. See you September know doubt. Peter.
Hi kranky80.Sorry for the misunderstanding. The dolphins is a restuarant on lindos main beach where I do the weather report each day I'm here. Sorry no real dolphins but a couple of stone ones by the restuarant. Lovely sandy beach and a shallow bay. Lindos is worth the visit to see the ancient acropolis which stands above the lovely village. Peter.
"Ha ha. Thanks for clarifying. Lindos sounds good, will definitely do a day trip."
Thank you for that Peter. Hopefully see you in September. I should be on the same flight as Roy unless he has to change plans because of Sun Studios not opening.Annie

"If there are few places open, does it mean more owners are outside their restaurants touting for custom?Must admit I’m not keen on that"
