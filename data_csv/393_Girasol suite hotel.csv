"General rules for hotels in Madeira apply. That includes wearing masks on public areas inside. You do not need to wear a mask while seated on an inside restaurant or bar, however if you need to circulate you must put them on. You do not need to wear masks on the hotel outside areas like when sunbathing and swimming.Edited: 12:43 pm, August 14, 2020 "
Many hotels have their COVID-19 procedures on their website. If not try emailing them to request copy.
