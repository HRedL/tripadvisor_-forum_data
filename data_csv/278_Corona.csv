"I know that the situation relating to Corona is rapidly evolving worldwide, but I'm just curious as to the current situation on Cape Verde.We're booked to go to Boa Vista at the end of April, but I'm guessing that the inhabitants may not want plane loads of (potentially infected) tourists coming to the islands - despite the impact that would have on the economy.Do any of the Destination Experts have any local insights?Many thanks."
"At the moment there are no flights from and to italy, more info here; https:/â€¦"
This is now a Pandemic you are at risk anywhere I would not risk going anywhere in Sub Sahara Africa at the present time not because of the risk of infection but because there medical facilities will be unable to cope and we should not assist in delivering this infection to the local population.
Got to agree with post #2 I doubt they are equipted to cope. Having said that if you are young fit and healthy and would loose your money by cancelling I would prob go.
Was not going to post as i do not consider myself an Expert but i would point out that one of the latest Suspected cases was a Capeverdian from Santo Antao who had just been to ITALY ! The Virus will eventually arrive even if Brits do not go.
"This is my opinion:Everyone should be aware that the medical facilities in CV are very limited. At the moment there are no cases but the people there are at great risk from someone bringing it with them from Europe. Not only do you put yourself at risk, you put all the residents at risk if you bring it with you."
"Thanks for the updates.My personal guess is that (for financial/insurance/liability reasons), TUI will not cancel flights to Cape Verde unless the Cape Verde government ban incoming flights. I'm sure that wouldn't be an easy decision to make, but you would have to hope that they would put the health and safety of the inhabitants before the economic impact.The problem facing people who have paid for their holidays and are due to fly out shortly is whether to go (and risk (1) being ill on an island with very limited medical facilities and/or (2) carrying the infection to the island - even if you don't currently have symptoms, it doesn't mean that you don't have Coronavirus) or to stay (and lose the cost of the holiday, as it won't be covered by travel insurance).Everybody is caught between a rock and a hard place :-("
