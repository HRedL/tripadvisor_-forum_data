"Cuba is doing a remarkable job in controlling the virus it seems. Here is the latest data from Cubadebate:At the close of Wednesday, May 20, Cuba reported 8 positive cases to COVID-19, one deceased and 30 medical discharges were reported, Dr. Francisco Durán García, national director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health (Minsap) reported at a press conference. ).The specialist specified that 1,743 samples were studied for COVID-19. The country accumulates 89,031 samples carried out and 1,908 positive (2.1%).689 patients are admitted to hospitals, 11 are under surveillance, 455 are suspected, and 223 are confirmed. Another 1 697 people are being watched at home from Primary Health Care.Of the 8 new cases diagnosed: They are all Cubans. 7 (87.5%) were contacts of confirmed cases. In 1 the source of infection was not specified. 4 are male and 4 female. 3 were asymptomatic. Age groups most affected: four from 40 to 59 years old (50.0%) and two from 20 to 39 years old (25.0%) and a six-month-old girl.Of the 1 908 patients diagnosed with the disease: 1,667 (89.2%) are contacts of confirmed cases. In 69 (3.6%) the source of infection was not specified. 131 (7%) have a source of infection abroad. 975 (51.1%) are male and 933 (48.8%) are female. 50% of positive cases have been asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. 223 remain admitted, of which 218 (97.7%) have stable clinical evolution. One patient in critical condition and four in serious condition are reported. There are 80 deaths, two evacuees and 1 603 recovered patients (84.0%). 194 are children, of whom 166 are on medical discharge.Edited: 11:46 am, May 21, 2020 "
Yesterday’s death was the first in a week.The 8 new confirmed cases were 6 in Havana and 2 in Matanzas.
And no new cases in many parts of Oriente for quite a while.
"camaguey hasn't had a case in about a week now. Most provinces are dong really well. The only provinces who are reporting cases regularly now are Matanzas, Habana and Santa Clara. I agree with Bellagio that the Cuban government is doing a great job at containing the pandemic. Putting most infected person in a dedicated hospital, isolating anyone who was in contact with someone infected, having those who work with infected or potential cases to work 14 days, then 14 days quarantine before being allowed back home, and now doing random testing in areas that have no reported cases (some of the new cases where caught like that as they did not have symptoms and were not contact from any positive or suspect case). And also having everyone wear a mask. All that must have made a huge difference."
"Allow me to digress, but there is some relevance in what I'll put down' In the book World War Z by Max Brooks, a novel about the zombie plague and the responses to the pandemic by different nations throughout the world, which restarted a whole entertainment industry about Zombies ( The Walking Dead, etc). The USA doesn't come off so good and mirrors almost exactly how the US is handling Covid 19 today, ignoring the problem, fake cures, etc.An excerpt describing the US response from the book from Wikipedia, this was written quite a few years ago. _____________________The United States does little to prepare because of its overconfidence in its ability to suppress any threat, and the desire to not cause a panic during an election year. Although special forces teams contain initial small-scale domestic outbreaks, a widespread effort never starts: the US is deprived of political will by ""brushfire wars"", and a widely distributed and marketed placebo vaccine, Phalanx, creates a false sense of security.______________________This is how Cuba's success during the outbreak went:________________During World War Z, nearly every nation on Earth was pushed to the brink of extermination by the Zombie Hordes. However, some people, countries, and animals actually benefitted from the War by using large masses and terrain as profitable, vital materials. Countries such as Ireland, Denmark, Multiple islands in the Pacific, Tibet, Greenland, and especially Cuba actually thrived and became stronger than before the War, gathering large economic strength along with political reform. However, out of all of these, Cuba, which at one point was the second poorest nation in the Caribbean, actually became the richest country in the postwar world.Cuba provided an ideal refuge for many reasons. Aside from the surrounding Caribbean waters buying them time to prepare, their lack of diplomatic ties to the United States, their militaristic dictatorship, and their generally well educated populace (in addition to the millions of Cuban Americans returning to their country of their ethnicity), helped to resist the initial waves of zombies. Early outbreaks through transforming refugees were handled early and in brutal fashion. Their shorelines were quickly fortified. While Cuba was by no means spared the heavy fighting all survivor nations saw, their early success bred more success. The stability made it a beacon in a world of death. Cuba's warm climate allowed it to quickly switch from cash crops to sustenance farming - in contrast to survivors in other parts of the world who fled above the snow line, in places like Canada, Siberia, and Iceland, where starvation and cannibalism soon set in.Soon, it attracted more specialized workers and talent, while harshly screening out undesirables. Before long, Cuba was one of the world's most powerful nations.Edited: 12:43 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"Mike, I agree that it must have to do with the testing. Most of the kids who tested positive were asymptomatic, they were only tested because they were contact of a positive case.I don't know for the other provinces, but in Quebec, they only test you if you have symptoms and if you have a risk factor, like being the contact of a positive case. I read that most kids show little to no symptoms, so they probably are not tested as much. Quebec's décision to restrict the tests so much is, in my opinion, one of the factors that lead to how bad it is in Montreal right now. For example,"
"They keep promising to test more in Quebec, but nothing changes. There was a story on the news of a health care worker who wanted to get tested and they wouldn't test her, she worked in long term care facility that had one of the worse outbreaks and she was being transferred to another facility. She had to lie in order to get tested and she was tested positive, She said she could have started a whole new outbreak.. They should be able to test ANYONE who wants one. They will never get this under control.Edited: 1:23 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"I here you sssnake. I have a friend who showed symptoms and had been contact with someone who was showing symptoms too and who had been in contact with someone who tested positive. Since my friend had not been in direct contact with someone who was infected, and waiting for the ""middle party""'s results, they refused to test her. Not only that, but her boss forced her to go to work. Half of the 10 coworkers were infected... There must be tones and tones of stories like that. At least, Cuba is doing a lot of test, and about half of the cases they catch don't show any symptoms when they are diagnosed."
"Mike - regarding ages, I don’t think that I have seen detailed analysis from any other country."
"Cuba reported at the close of Thursday 21 May, 8 more positive cases to COVID-19, for a cumulative of 1,916 people positive to the virus; and 1 further death.At the end of May 21, a total of 669 patients are admitted to hospitals, under surveillance 3, suspects 464, and confirmed 202. Another 1,790 people are monitored in their homes from Primary Health Care.Of the 8 new cases diagnosed:They're all Cubans. 5 from Havana and 3 from MatanzasThey're all confirmed case contacts.5 (62,5%) are male and 3 (37.5%) of the female sex.4 of the cases were asymptomatic.The most affected age group was 40 to 60 years, with 6 cases (75%)The one death was a 56-year-old male Cuban citizen residing in Matanzas municipality"
"Cuba reported at the close of Friday, May 22, 15 new positive cases to COVID-19, for a cumulative of 1,931 people confirmed with the disease since March 11. No further deaths are reported Of the 15 new cases:They're all Cubans. - 13 from Havana 1 from Matanzas and 1 from Morón, Ciego de Avila province. 100% are confirmed case contactsNine (60%) were women and six (40%) Men.The most affected age group was 40 to 60 years old with eight cases (53.3%).60% (9) of the positive cases were asymptomatic.Edited: 10:15 am, May 23, 2020 "
"No doubt that Cuba is on top of the situation, Ken. Just goes to show what can be accomplished with a government that takes charge and takes responsibility for stemming the virus as grown ups.Terry"
I mentioned before in another thread - this site https://covid19cubadata.github.io/#cuba shows details of cases by municipio and allows you to compare provinces and municipios in their daily changes.
"Cuba reported at the close of Saturday 23 May 10 positive cases of COVID-19, plus one more death. Of the 10 new cases diagnosed:They're all Cubans. 5 cases in Havana, 4 in Matanzas Province and 1 in Granma Province.9 are confirmed case contacts and 1 has a source of infection abroadEight (80.0%) were women and two (40%) Men.Six (60%) positive cases were asymptomatic.The most affected age group was under 40 with five cases (50.0%), followed by 40 to 60 years with three cases (30.0%).An 85-year-old Cuban citizen who lived in Santa Clara, Villa Clara province, died during the day."
And yet all it could take is a dozen tourists planes landing to completely turn their good results in the other direction.
"Cuba reported at the close of Sunday, May 24, 6 positive cases to COVID-19, and no further deaths.At the end of May 23, 445 patients are admitted to hospitals, including 285 suspects and 159 confirmed. Another 1,996 people are monitored in their homes, from primary health care.Of the 6 new cases diagnosed:They're all Cubans. 5 from Havana and 1 from Morón, Ciego de Avila province.Five (83.3%) confirmed case contacts and one (16.7%) the source of infection is not specified.Three (50%) were women and three (50%) Men83.3% (5) of positive cases were asymptomatic.The most affected age group was 40 to 60 years with four cases (66.6%), followed by the child under 40 with two cases (33.3%)."
"And every day, when the government releases the figures, they provide in detail the underlying conditions the deceased person had and 99% had underlying symptoms ore were well over the age of 80"
"re 16 - something went wrong with the translation in the last line:seguido del menor de 40 años = followed by the under 40nothing to do with children.re 17 - though I don´t know enough to understand. Is ¨Antecedentes Patológicos Personales: Insuficiencia Venosa Periférica. ¨life threatening ?Edited: 10:15 am, May 25, 2020 "
"Cuba reported at the close of Monday 25 May 16 positive cases to COVID-19, and no further deaths Of the 16 new cases 13 were in Havana and 3 in Matanzas. All were Cubans, 11 were women and 5 were men."
"Cuba reported at the close of Tuesday, May 26th eleven positive cases to COVID-19, and no further deaths Of the 11 cases diagnosed all were Cuban, seven were women and four men,. 9 of the confirmed cases were in Havana, 1 in Morón, Ciego province of Avila and 1 in Bauta municipality, Artemisa province"
Thanks for the update Ken.Appreciate the Real time information . Unlike the cowboys Waltzing down Memory Lane! lol
I do wonder about the strong bias toward women being infected vs. the male population. My suspicion is that women are being forced outside to spend long amounts of time in line to buy food with the inherent wielding of social distancing.
"Although in recent days, there have been more women, I don’t know if that is statistically significant. In total, 51.7% of cases confirmed have been men. Since 1 May, there hace been 228 men and 189 women.(I have just discovered that the cubadata github site has tags which give more analysis).Of the deaths, about 2/3 are men.And one thing that I had not realised - of the first three cases, the Italian tourists- 2 were women, and only one was a man."
beardo: thanks for the clarification. My data came from only reading the recent daily reports. Good to see the overall numbers.
"Cuba reported at the close of Wednesday, May 27th, 9 positive cases to COVID-19, and no further deaths Of the 9 new cases diagnosed: 5 were male and 4 femaleThey're all Cubans. 8 in Havana province, and 1 in Matanzas province.The national director of Epidemiology of Minsap reiterated that the pandemic stage is not over, because this disease continues to affect several continents.According to Cuban experts, the island reached the peak of the epidemic on April 24. ""Since then we have been falling below the favorable forecast, regardless of the emergence of new cases,"" said Durán García."
"22 new cases of coronavirus reported in Cuba at the close of Thursday 28th May. 17 cases in Havana, 4 in Artemisa province and 1 in Matanzas province.They are all Cubans. 13 cases are female and 9 male."
"Cuba reported at the close of Friday, May 29th, 20 new positive cases and one further death, a 77-year-old female. Three patients are reported in a serious condition.Of the 20 new confirmed cases, They are all Cubans. 17 were women and three men. All cases are from Havana: municipality Playa 8 cases, Marianao 4, Arroyo Naranjo 3; October 10, La Lisa, Havana del Este, Centro Habana and Cerro, with one case each."
Hi Ken Hope you and yours are safe and well during this time .Thanks for your updates every day .Many thanks take care  Regards PAUL M
"Of the cases reported today, 14 were related to an evert in. pharmaceutical laboratory."
"Cuba reported at the close of Saturday, May 30th, a further 20 positive cases to COVID-19, and no further deaths. Of the 20 new confirmed cases, they are all Cubans, 13 were women and 7 men and all cases are from Havana. and 12 of whom are related to the event at AICA Laboratories which was the source of infection for 14 others yesterday as mentioned by beardo."
"With the latest, Havana has now had slightly over 50% of the total confirmed cases.This is only the third day this month when new confirmed cases exceeded the number dicharged. Cuba has gone from 778 active cases on 1 May to 151 active cases."
"My friends who live in Centro and in Cerro report that they have not been able to travel to see family in Ciego or leave the city at all, that food is scarce, but that they re staying indoors as much as possible and feel pretty secure that they will not get infected....... They also think that because I live NEAR NYC (in Vermont), that things must be scary for me and mine..... hard to describe the differences since the US is basically either Miami or NYC to them....."
All travel between provinces has been restricted for some time now. I heard that is was going to restart but I don’t know if that was just a rumour.
"Cuba reported at the close of Sunday, May 31st, 38 new positive cases to COVID-19, but no further deaths. Of the 38 new confirmed cases: They are all Cubans. 24 women and 14 men.37 cases belong to Havana and one to the province of Matanzas. Of the confirmed patients in the capital, 29 are related to the transmission event that arises in AICA laboratories and one is linked to the commercial transport company."
"Cuba reported 9 positive cases to COVID-19 and no further deaths at the close of Monday, June 1st.All are resident in Havana: 3 are male and 6 female. Five were related to the AICA Laboratories event."

"What is the ""AICA Laboratories event""? Sorry, I cannot find any other info. Is it somehow related to the La Epoca event? Was that just a case of community transmission from many people crowded into the shopping center?Edited: 10:18 am, June 02, 2020 "
"Does anyone know if the ""AICA Laboratories event"" with all the infected people was an accident inside the actual medical production facility or simply a case of community spread within office workers?This is more than internet chatter to fill time during quarantine to me. This is part of my continuing reassessment of validity of information from the Cuban government as I am holding an American Airlines ticket into Havana on 9 July. I do like to make decisions based on actual data."
"Cuba, like most of the world, expects a November wave:https:/…"
"Majority of the Havana's cases in the last week or so is linked to the incident at La Epoca, including the cases from the laboratory.There is one employee of La Epoca store, Centro Habana, who went to work even if he was symptomatic. He also failed to report his symptoms to the authorities. His bosses let him work despite the symptoms and the security mesures (social distancing, wearing the mask at all time, washing his hands) were not respected. Many of his coworkers as well as customers were infected as a result. His wife works at ... The laboratory!!! She contaminated many of her coworkers. Beardo, from what I have seen, most infected from the laboratory are women. A driver who delivered to the store was infected and brought the virus back to his workplace and neighbourhood. One person who does not comply with the rules, dozens infected... Cubans is lucky not to have had more incidents like that. For example, a neighbour and his wife who just came back from Habana. They should have gone to a center for a 14 days quarantine. They did not. They are visiting other neighbours, going to work, they even had a party last week when they came back. One of the person at the party is a nurse working in a clinic and going on mission soon. An other is a cancer patient. They also split their time between his house in our neighbourhood and her house in an other neighbourhood. When the med student come for the daily pesquisa, they hide and he neighbour (his sisters, one of which who's a nurse) say there is no one living in the house. Now, if they are infected, it could be catastrophic. Between their 2 houses, 2 workplace, the nurse's workplace, etc, they have been in contact with hundreds of people in the last week. Fingers crossed that they are not contaminated."
"Gengen.., sadly that is all it takes, just one person to not respect the rules. New Brunswick, a model province here in Canada with dealing with Cov-19, total 120 cases, all cured, no new infections in a couple of weeks I believe. Then one Doctor goes out of province to Quebec, and doesn't do the mandatory 14 day quarantine when he returns to NB, and doesn't tell anyone he went to Quebec. He gets infected and has now passed it on to patients, and other health care workers. Now that whole health authority area is set back with new infections daily , directly related to his indiscretion , and just as they were lifting more of their lockdown regulations. He has dealt that area, and possibly the whole province of New Brunswick a major blow. It only takes one.Edited: 7:55 pm, June 02, 2020 "
"Gengen #42: thank you so much for the information about the infected people at AICA Laboratories. While sad to hear that one irresponsible person was the cause to so many infections there, I am comforted by the fact that it was not a result of some accident within the production facility."
"The 68-year-old initial positive case in Gibara (now deceased) flaunted the law against inter-provincial travel and returned to his family's home in Gibara from his residence in Havana, infecting all six family members who, in turn were in contact with over 100 others, who in turn were in contact with over 200 others, etc. etc., leading to the six week long quarantine. Part of the problem in Cuba is that you are not paid for sick days unless you miss a week of work, although I do not know if that remains the case during the virus. So when you're living on the edge financially, earning very little to begin with, two days of pay loss means two days of going without at months end. But that is still no reason to disobey the law at the peril of the health of thousands of your compatriots."
"SWnova: You're right, it only take one. It blows my mind that a doctor would be so irresponsible. Sadly,many doctors think they know better then anyone.Bob, I too was reassured. At first, Like you, i assumed that it was an incident at the lab. And that made me doubt how secure we were in Cuba. Now, an irresponsible couple going to work can and did happen anywhere."
"Candy, one person causing the entire town to be in quarantine. Do you know if that family in trouble with the neighbourhood now? From what I have seen, entire neighbourhood can efficiently shunt one person or family. I hope it's not their case. That man died, it's enough of a burden.People who are put on quarantine at home receive 100% of their salary. People who are put on quarantine in a center or hospital receive 60% because they don't have to pay for their food, electricity, gaz, detergent, etc. People who are off work because of the virus received 100% of their salary the first month and 70% after. They all had the option to be transferred to an other type of work to earn 100% of their salaries. Same for the mother who had to stay home to care for the kids that are off school.I understand that for many, their salary represent only a small % of what they get from their work. But still, it's no excuse like you said."
Gengen:Many thanks for the explanation. I knew the La Epoca store was involved but I didn't know how it tied in with the AICA Laboratory outbreak until I just read your post.Let's hope it's under control now and there are no more infections because of this incident.

"According to the published statistics in Canada, there were 40 cases in Quebec traced back to Cuba and 14 from Ontario. This was until the end of April. I assume that other countries with citizens vacationing in Cuba would have similar results. The higher number of cases in Quebec represents the fact that spring break is the first week in March. People wishing to visit Cuba in the near future should think very carefully. There was a segment on the news with officials from the various sectors in the travel industry warning that while flights may be starting up and destinations advertising a return to business, the insurers will not cover for health insurance. This is a serious consideration and not to be taken lightly."
"I’d be curious as to what measures the Cuban medical system would even have in place that an insurer could dip into if they provided coverage. Seems like the main “medication” here is simply to go home, rest, and wait it out. Ventilators in Cuba? I’m not so sure about that.Plus, the medical system I’ve seen in Havana simply hovered around a bartering system... I wouldn’t expect much from an insurer when it comes to c-19 even if they did provide coverage."
This is how some in Havana are dealing with the situationhttps:/…
"Re 74 - where were those statistics published ? Is the insurance issue because your government still has a travel advisory ?75 - I don’t follow ? Barter ?76 - well, one anyway.Edited: 9:29 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"It was published in the Montreal Gazette. The number one transmission was from the U.S.A. for both provinces. In March, the Canadian government announced that all Canadians should return home. Insurers announced that there would be no health insurance after March 23. I had to contact several people who winter in Florida to advise them to get home immediately."
"The insurance companies will not cover any travel that started after the travel advisor is given by the government. But you are still covered for a trip that started before. Even if you decided not to go back home. Beardo, yes, the travel advisory is still in place, so most insurances do not offer to subscribe new insurances contract. However, if you are under a collective insurance (from work or other) then they might still cover. It depends on the wording of the contact."
"Gen, that's exactly right... at least it is for me. Under my company provided medical insurance group plan, I would still retain coverage for C-19 when traveling to Cuba... just another reason why I've never had to buy additional health insurance coverage when traveling. Terry"
"75 - barter as in a trade: I’ll give you X for Y.The handful of times I’ve had to see a doctor in Havana, we simply gave the doctor a “gift” — sometimes a specific item or less often, a small amount of money."
Hyru - that might be how local doctors are but I don’t think hospital stays are like that.
That very well may be true — Admittedly (and fortunately) I’ve never had to stay at a Cuban hospital.
"At the close of this Friday June 19th, Cuba reported 4 new positive cases to COVID-19, for a cumulative of 2 309 people positive to SARS-CoV-2; no further deaths were reported.Of the 4 new cases, They are all Cubans. Two are male and two female. All are from Havana (2 Arroyo Naranjo and 2 from La Lisa)"
"Hyru, you had to gift someone because you're a foreigner. The doctor should have charged you treat you, or even send you to an international clinic. Of course, Cubans do not pay to be treated. BUT... They offer have to give a bribe to see a specialist in an other province, or to get a better medication then the one usually available. My father in law had a cancer 5-6 years ago. He is from Santa Clara but went to Habana to see doctors there who knew more about his condition then in Santa Clara. He could get an appointment with the specialist because a family member worked with them. And he was given a special type of chimio that was rarely prescribed. When he came back to Santa Clara, the doctors where baffled that he could receive that specific chimio (and would received it every month for a year) because it was usually reserved for ""los jefes"" (the high ranked).Also, gifting your doctor or dentist usually ensure that you will receive proper local anesthesia before a surgery or dental treatment.I could go on... But my point is that, even though health care is suppose to be free, a few fielders here and there I sure that you receive better care. Many things in Cuba are like that. Of course, if you're a foreigner and are hospitalized in Cuba, you will receive the best of everything, because there is someone (you or your insurance) paying for it. In Camaguey (and probably in every province), there is even a special wings for foreigners in the provincial hospital."
"Yes, the special wing in the hospital in Cam city for foreigners that's actually in better shape with environmental aesthetics, new creature comforts, and proper full service care than my hospital here in Burlington. But one would have to pay for that extra privilege in Cam city... even with the PR status in their back pocket. Call it a ""user fee"". Nothing in this life is for free.Terry"
"Of course, and my message is for the majority of us on this forum; foreigners :)Point being, if you need to see a doctor in Cuba and you do not have insurance, it’s easily doable (and at my experience, rather cheap). “Money talks” is surely evident in Cuba.I’d be curious to hear from anyone who had insurance and used it while in Cuba — how much was the bill that your insurer had to pay?"
"I was hospitalized in Camaguey last summer for 2 nights and 3 days. I had Zika. They ran some blood tests to confirm it was Zika, and gave my some hydrating salt. I did not need anymore treatment.The tests were about 250cuc. The total cost was around 800$cnd."
"Insurance paid entire amount. Each doctor’s bill was $25 each and ambulance all came to $130.00. Once a man had a detached retina and he had insurance that covered medevac flight to Miami. Another time, a woman had severe gallbladder attack and the family was relieved and pleased that their insurance covered extended stay until she was stabilized enough to go home. I wouldn’t boast about having no insurance. Would you be happy if your family was left in a position to foot a bill in the thousands of dollars if the worst happened and they had to repatriate your body?"
"Hyru, it's easy and cheap to receive basic care in Cuba at a doctor's clinic. But if you need to be hospitalized, need surgery, need any special tests, etc... Then no, it's not cheap and cannot be done ""on the side""."
"Hyru - for a couple of x-rays, splint, consultancy, I paid 95CUC. Claimed after the fact.CCO - I don't think you would get put in the special wing if you have PR, unless you have insurance in addition. PR gives you same healthcare as Cuban citizens.Since having PR I've only had to get treatment at the polyclinic."
"Wow!! That's where and when you pay the big money... when you actually need to stay over-night in a hospital bed. Gen, you actually did well with that total amount based on your 2 night stay. Had a Canadian friend visit Cam city where he fainted (no booze involved)... and he needed 1 night in that foreigners wing for drip hydration... cost him 400cuc. But by comparison, when I visited to have blood taken and a chest x-ray, complete with certified report to support my PR application, the total was only 110cuc... and with me offering a bottle of Canadian ice wine as ""a gift"" to help speed the process too.Terry"
"Oh yes, forgot that - blood tests, chest x-ray, doctor's report - 110CUC. Just went to Cira Garcia when they told me to for the tests and back 2 days later to pick up results and report. No gift required."
"YaHez, staying over-night in the foreigner's wing would simply be a personal choice at extra cost. Of course with PR you can get the basics of treatment in the Cuban wing por nada, but still likely needing ""a gift"" to receive prompt attention. I've never needed any kind of medical care when in Cuba... thanking my lucky stars.TerryEdited: 12:38 pm, June 20, 2020 "
Hyru A first time tourist that goes tom Cuba or even the regulars that stay in Cuba will not be looking at a Cuban hospital or clinic but rather using the clinic they have at the resorts .My Grandson last year got sick in Varadero at the front desk they told my son to go to the International Clinic in Downtown Varadero cost $100 CUC to see a doctor and for the medicine .
"Even my wife there regularly offers ""a gift"" at the dental office or polyclinico to receive immediate and/or better attention for herself and our daughter. She knows the drill. That's just par for the course in Cam city. Terry"
"@96 Yes, most of the time the gifting is for queue jumping, but it can serve other purposes.I haven't felt the need to initiate gifting on the very limited occasions I've had to seek healthcare."
Terry Cuban friends in Cardenas also do the same as your wife when they want something faster at the local dentist or clinic .They say a gift goes a long way when they need something from these places .
"…""They say a gift goes a long way when they need something from these places .""No different than the car mechanic or electrician. It is engrained throughout the system. A small propina is expected to have the wait time shortened."
As I always say... capitalism is alive and well in Cuba. ;-)Terry
"My experience was in DR, so obviously different from Cuba, but I simply off er it as an example of how genuinely necessary it is to have insurance. I was hospitalized for acute anaemia...... in intensive care for four days and nights, with a further two nights in a private ward. During that time I received 3 blood transfusions, ultrasound, X-ray, echocardiogram, and innumerable blood tests. The care was excellent, and the hospital clean and well equipped. No one spoke English, which was a surprise, since this was a ''tourist "" hospital, but the nurses and doctors were just lovely, and more than prepared to keep things simple, and cope with my limited Spanish. The total bill came to almost $20,000 USD and had to paid upfront. (Thank the Lord for good credit !)I had an EPIC battle with the insurance company on my return, to get reimbursed. It took me a very stressful 3 months to finally get the money, and I could write a book on the excuses and prevarications they tried, in their efforts not to pay out. I had foolishly gone with the company that offered the cheapest quote......a valuable lesson learned.If you are not insured through your work, bank or credit card company, I would strongly recommend going through one of the major insurance companies. But please make sure that you ARE insured....had I not been, it would have taken me a VERY long time to recover from that debt !Barb"
And to bring it back to the topic of this thread - I wonder what the foreigners who were hospitalised with Covid were charged ?
"Beardo, After the borders closed, Dr Durand said that everyone would receive free treatment for Covid, including foreigners. But I don't know if it was the case before the borders closed and never say a confirmation of what's Dr Durand said anywhere."
"At the close of this Saturday, June 20th, Cuba reported 3 new positive cases to COVID-19, for a cumulative 2312 people positive to SARS-CoV-2, No further deaths were reported.Of the 3 new cases, all are Cubans and all females from Havana (2 Parakew and 1 Cerro)"
"Ken, hoping for a big fat "" 0 "" soon... I can see it happening. Hopefully that sticks when it gets there too. Terry"
Parakew ??? Weren’t they from Cotorro?
beardo:I'm posting what Cubadebate says in the English translation - (2 Parakew and 1 Cerro). Agreed the Spanish version does say 2 Cotorro y 1 Cerro.
I didn’t realise that there was an option in English. I guess that they use a machine translator.
beardo:The new version of Microsoft Edge does an automatic instant translation. It may not be 100% accurate but it's good enough for me.
"Hi,Why has this become pendantry retort forum?The simple posts by Bellagio are so useful, but to nitpick them, really!"
"At the close of this Sunday, June 21st, Cuba reported 3 new positive cases to COVID-19, for a cumulative of 2315 people positive to SARS-CoV-2. No further deaths were reported.Of the 3 new cases, they are all Cubans. 2 males and 1 female. All residents of Havana Province (from the municipalities of Arroyo Naranjo, Cotorro and Habana del Este)."
"We waked up this morning with the announcement of another 3 positive cases in our city. They are all contacts of previous infected cases. They were all asymptomatic (like the 80% positive during the last 15 days). We are testing around two thousand people daily so this means we are now testing apparently healthy population trying to find new cases non-related with previously infected compatriots.Havana and Matanzas still waiting to move forward to another phase like the rest of the country. It looks like Matanzas would get back to “new normality” next week. Havana? I must say I am not optimistic.We are all waiting for the special edition ( re: Tabloid) of Granma’s newspaper with the description of all phases and periods we have ahead and all measures, protocols, etc we shall take from now on. It was announced last week by the President."
Thank you for posting. Sounds like they have it under control.
Thank you for the update. Nice to see these low numbers. Surely Havana and Matanzas will be moving forward shortly... how much lower can your numbers get when you still have 3 phases left?
"Thanks for the update Voy. Compared to the UK Cuba has done a fantastic job. We have 42,632 deaths compared to Cuba's 85."
"From what I understand, they want the provinces to not have any positive cases for at least 14 days before starting phase 1. So for Habana, it can take a while to get there."
Matanzas enters phare 1 today or tomorrow depending on the source - juventudrebelde.cu/cuba/2020-06-22/matanzas-…cubadebate.cu/noticias/….XvEuDOd7nIU(It´s probably midnight tonight).
"The first link was later amended to say tomorrow, too."
"Matanzas will be “free” starting today.Havana figures until Midnight June 22nd:3 positive cases again in Havana (nothing in the rest of the country). We are averaging around fifteen hundred tests daily only in Havana.Gengen @ 116 is right ; but personally it seems to me that at some point our Gov. will have to re-think Havana’s protocols unless they plan to have the city “closed” during the summer entirely. Hopefully I am wrong as it will take Havana city government to bring to the city the entire Police force of Cuba entirely to be able to control the city that long. In reality although authorities insist in keeping strictly measures and discipline, people are starting to “relax” mentally and you can see the city “moving” in the direction of an unofficial opening decision."
Today report based upon the situation until yesterday at Midnight:Just one positive case from approximately two thousands plus tests. Fom these tests 50% (aproximately) made in Havana only. These are extremely good news!
"The one new case was a 43-year-old Cuban citizen, resident in the municipality of Centro Habana, 14 contacts are kept under surveillance."
Today’s report:Two thousands plus tests nationwide and two positive cases in Havana only.
What is the recovered numbers?
"Cuban Ministry of Public Health Facebook Account:2,171 recovered patients (41 medical discharges yesterday).Details of the two new confirmed cases:30-year-old Cuban citizen, resident in the municipality of Habana del Este, province of Havana. Contact of previously confirmed case, asymptomatic. 49 contacts are kept under surveillance.50-year-old Cuban citizen, resident in the Arroyo Naranjo municipality, Havana province. Contact of previously confirmed case, asymptomatic. 23 contacts are kept under surveillance."
Thank you. Cuba does have this under control.
It appears so. Their ability to cast a web of all the contacts of the positive individuals and get them tested as soon as possible is certainly in their favor.I look forward to seeing that big zero for a few days.
"Likewise, that big ZERO should happen soon... if not in Havana, then consistently throughout the rest of the island at least over a 2 to 3 week period. Hopeful details of Phase 3 can then be announced for those areas free of the virus too to help get things back to normal... or the 'new normal' for us independent visitors again.Terry"
"We will start with phase 2, that would be an improvement. We're all still in phase one, except Habana of course. Phase 2, at least in the Oriente and Centro where there have not been any cases in weeks/months would make sense.I'm thinking phase 3 (at least when it comes to letting people in) will be more about accessing the risk of the state of the world rather then the state of Cuba. Because if Cuba let's, for example, American and Brazilians enter anywhere without anything more then a Covid test at entree, Cuba will be back where it was 3 months ago in now time."
"I agree that stage 3 is likely more so what’s going on in the world rather than in Cuba. Less than 5 cases per day showing up on the entire island (and almost all in Havana now), how much better can the situation in Cuba get? That being said, I do think that economic pressure from the private sector in Havana that relies on tourism is something that will be felt and perhaps considered in going to phase 3."
"Cuba bueno! For now! Alot of the rest of the world, no bueno. ps - i no i shouldn't say this, but, i really don't believe Cuba's numbers. But they are doing muy muy bueno! For now!"
"Our governments can be selective about what countries they now want to interface with regarding new tourism. I agree, forget the US for now. But for the life of me, I can't understand what the hold up is with our Canadian government now making the much needed announcement that tourist flights to Cuba under their phase 2 parameters can now begin for sure on August 01st. I know that the airlines are advertising packages for sale for that date, but as far as I'm aware, there's still been no official announcement from the Canadian government that things can proceed with flights to Cuba and elsewhere within the Caribe and the world that now deservingly warrant their blessing to allow things to commence. Terry"
"Hola"" I know that the airlines are advertising packages for sale "" and in return they will give you a voucher after they say sorry no flight....lolcheers."
"The airline and tourism industry are lobbying, of course.This article was released earlier today by the globe and mail (accessible via free login):https:/…"
Have I read this correctly?Only 66 active cases ? WOW Cuba you are under control.
I find it hard to believe countries have low figures
Some countries have done the right thing - most including the UK have not!
Mixed emotions for me. I am both happy and a bit proud that Cuba has done all the right things to have such impressive stats. But then I must acknowledge that one of the right things they did was keeping people like me from entering the country because of the way our home government handled things so wrongly.
This morning:Two thousands plus tests (re: country has decided to average daily over two thousands tests) and four positive cases. Two of them contacts from previous infected people. Unfortunately three cases for Havana and now Mayabeque has its first positive case after more than fifteen days without one.
When I hear people in such a hurry to get back to Cuba I just shake my head How is your country doing probably not good at all by looking at the numbers of Covid cases .You just have to look from were the tourists that go to Cuba come from to understand its a no brainer to visit another country .Poor Cuba when they open the borders to tourists watch the numbers climb up because people all they care about is there vacation and could not what will happen to Cubans .
"gat0 @139, I don't agree. That's a rather simplistic way to look at things and I don't believe there's any truth to that at all. Most of us who are upwardly mobile and educated have a firm grip on our responsibilities in the face of this pandemic, and also completely understand what will be necessary to maintain compliance and success with the Cuban government's new rules of engagement during phase 2. The lot of use are just waiting for our Canadian government's new rules of engagement to be announced.rrrchar @132, like I had mentioned before, all the more reason why we need our Canadian government to officially give the green light to our airline industry to begin new flights to various destinations on a selective basis when looking at the numbers. Agreed?TerryEdited: 9:51 am, June 26, 2020 "
But unlike the UK most countries aren’t saying what their all cause mortality rates are . That is the reason the uk death rate is high
The UK is declaring deaths WITHcovid and not FROM.So hence numbers are higher.
"Hola @139""The true number of Americans who've been infected with COVID-19 may top 20 million, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""Our best estimate right now is that for every case that's reported, there actually are 10 other infections""if this is true for other countries also. Why would any country that is doing well , or province(like B.C. want to open up to the world or certain countries....just look at the disaster down south, which perhaps could of been stopped if someone was serious about stopping this bug.Terry,"" Most of us who are upwardly mobile and educated have a firm grip on our responsibilities in the face of this pandemic....now to me that is simplistic...and dangerous. People are people at times a collective group really not that smart. just look around many are not acting the way they should...imo.Lets just hope they have a shot for this sometime next year, and we all can start to prepare for the next one , and not put our collective heads in the sand. The next one could be way worse....Man that is depressing, off to my golf game this morning...lol.cheers."
"rrrichar, using new tourism to Cuba as the example with their extremely low numbers, I see that being no different than a trip to the supermarket here in Canada with, of course, all of the precautions of face masks and sanitation applied to thwart the virus as well. Now call that being overly simplistic if you must, but think about it... if the Canadian government wished to open things up now with giving thier green light, there are few other examples available where doing so could be so less threatening on a limited basis.TerryEdited: 10:30 am, June 26, 2020 "
"From what I recall, none of us have ran a country recently.There are various moving parts that need to be addressed. I don't think it's as simple as looking at the number of cases or potential number of cases. Governments need to look at realistic risks of this virus vs what the long term effects will be of a shut down (or half opened) nation. I believe the best answer is somewhere in between; that is -- a gradual and educated approach to a re-opening. Some of you sound like you expect the world to be shut down forever (or until a vaccine is found -- which may never come). Governments are accountable to their people, their businesses and livelihood. Their decisions to shut down their borders are based on their understanding at that particular time -- and the hopes of slowing down a virus which they know very little about. As time progresses, we get better info, statistics, and we also see the collateral effects of being shut down. We get a better understanding of whether our medical system can uphold the potential waves that are to come. These are sovereign nations and they will decide what approach they wish to take. But I don't think it's as simple as ""we fear an outbreak and therefore we will be closed until a vaccine is made.""As a matter of opinion; I think countries with very low numbers (like Cuba) that heavily rely on tourism need to gradually open -- as Cuba is doing. Put in whatever pre-cautions you can; airport tests, questionnaires, etc. For the departing country (in our case, Canada), I think we need to see how each country is doing and determine whether we want people returning from there.Edited: 10:35 am, June 26, 2020 "
"I think it's a little different if you're just a tourist wanting to go on a vacation, is it really necessary. On the other hand, if you have your family there naturally someone would look at it in a different way."
"Hola @146exactly short and to the point...would love to get on the vacations plans again, at this point it will not happen, and not to be a Debbie downer, second wave of this bug.....enjoy the day, off to golf.cheers."
"Hyru @145, very well said. And Lori @146... exactly right. There may never be a vaccine for COVID-19... this is true. Think of HIV Aids... it's now been decades and there's still no vaccine for that... only remedies for infection to limit the damage. The world needs to keep turning and functioning in the face of reality... we can't keep things on hold forever. TerryEdited: 10:44 am, June 26, 2020 "
"Hi, I thought this was a daily digest of the numbers for Cuba that Bellagio created to update us. Not a pissing contest on which country is leading the medal table in deaths! However you juggle your numbers."
Obviously you thought wrong.Terry
"We have had travel advisories to certain countries before . Why not have the same sort of thing , not allowing people from high covid rate counties in. Keep it down the middle , Ron!"
Hiv/aids has a therapy rather than a vaccineThere is a man called Professor Chris Whitty who is England’s Chief Medical Officer who did a lecture on epidemics. He said you either need a vaccine or theraputics( medicine) to get through a epidemic and so that was found for hiv/aids He said the same for covid
"I would think that for practically 95% of people, the therapy needed is ""go home and rest.""Most recover without being admitted to the hospital, and for those that are, only a small minority require oxygen/ventilation. Even then, I believe dexamethasone has been shown to reduce deaths by 1/3-1/8 for those individuals. Whether or not the above amounts to adequate therapy or not -- I guess that depends on who you ask."
Here´s the daily report from oncubanews - https:/…

"On today´s figures - the deceased was in Havana - she had been mentioned in the reports as in critical state in recent days.None of the new cases are in Havana. One, from Cienfuegos, had arrived from Mexico.The other four are from Mayabeque province."
"At the close of this Saturday,June 27th Cuba reported two new cases of COVID-19 but no further deaths.The two cases are from Havana (Cotorro and Centro Habana municipalities). One is a male and the other is a female."
"In terms of the future Cuba has already designed all the scenarios moving forward including when – and more importantly- how international tourism will be allowed again. This plan while following general guidelines established by WHO takes into consideration also Cuba’s own visions on things as per our experiences here within the country; and the experiences from all our doctors abroad.We have a Task Force presided by the President, Prime Minister and Vice-President controlling daily all aspects of this battle and taking necessary decisions. There is a Scientific Council meeting with this Task Force as well on weekly basis. We have worked not only to establish our own treatment protocols using a high percentage of Cuba’s Bio-tech medications but also we have three vaccination prospects in process. We must be optimistic about them.This morning we woke up with 8 positive cases as results of 2,210 PCR tests. Cases are from Habana; and 5 of them contacts of those positive cases from Mayabeque province. There are twp bordering municipalities involved: Cotorro (Habana) and San Jose (Mayabeque). Street rumor refer this event to an unauthorized Church gathering. No fatalities. NO critical cases on ICUs. We have only 41 hospitalized cases with Covid at the moment."
"2,246 tests nationwide. 1 positive case contact of a previous one from “EL Roble” settlement in Mayabeque. BTW entire village has been tested already. We have 39 positive cases hospitalized, no fatality and one in ICU."
7 new cases yesterday. Source: 6 from previous confirmed cases and 1 from abroad:5 in Cotorro1 in Mayabeque1 in Las Tunas
"June 30th at Midnight:PCR tests nationwide:2,272.00 (each province their own portions).Positive cases: 7 ( 5 from Havana-Cotorro), 1 from Mayabeque and 1 from abroad)Hospitalized cases: 146 from which 42 are positive.Patients at ICU: 1From March 11th up to June 30th :Total of tests: 173,063Total positive cases: 2,348.00Fatalities: 86Cuba plans to reach up to 5 thousand plus tests daily in the coming weeks."
The case from Las Tunas does not count at a provincial case as the origin of the infection was not within Cuba but abroad. All Cuban permanent residents arriving via humanitarian flights are taken to two week of quarantine where they are tested.
I note that 5 of the cases were 18 years or under. Only the traveller from the US and one other were older.
The protocol of the vaccine testing has changed abit from yesterday. Instead of only having eight weekly swab tests I now do 4 months worth
Like everything with this covid things change daily. At the end of the day we are all waiting to hear the good news that it works.
Encouragingly it’s showing in trials it’s giving people the right immune response
Fantastic .

Thanks! This is brilliant! Better numbers than here in BC.
Better numbers than most places but still leaving some of us biting our nails. Hopefully these numbers decline rather than increase. Fingers crossed.
Part of the Cerro municipality of Havana has been placed in to isolation because of recent cases.
"July 8:2,844 PCR test (2,205 in Havana only).4 + cases (all from previous + cases )No dead. No critical conditions patients.Still 69 + cases hospitalized."
"And of those in hospital, 4 are ¨grave¨ - one less than yesterday."
Thank you! Keeping us informed with facts. Door to door testing. More doctors per capita than anywhere else. Canada could learn from Cuba. Uruguay is also doing well. Citizens were told to stay home. They have. There numbers are manageable. The US and Brazil on the other hand...I wonder if there will be Covid free ‘islands’ in place. Like the EU not allowing Americans in. My heart goes out to all who cannot trust their leaders with implementing measures guided by science.

I would say “sadly” Gen They seem to be doing pretty good for a city that size.
I Wouldn’t say.....
I say sadly because almost all of the cases in the last month are link to a few events when people did not follow instructions and were reckless. The direct effect of those few people's actions is that the entire town just entered in phase 1 and is delayed to enter phase 2 with the rest of the provinces.I find it sad for all of those who are following the instructions and are punished for the actions of those few.
"It almost appears to be a double edged sword to have cases this low. On one end, it’s great news in comparison to the rest of the world and the general population. On the other end, anything except “zero new cases” seems to be a a disappointment (and maybe a barrier to phase 3?). Covid isn’t leaving us anytime soon... so even with zero cases and going into phase 3, I hope everyone understands this is something that you likely will not eliminate for the foreseeable future. Without that mindset, it’ll be disappointments all around.Edited: 2:20 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"Cuba does not need to have 0 cases to move to phase 3. There are 5 criterias to help the governers decide if their province can switch from one phase to an other. Phase 3 is not ""normal life"". They are repeating over and over that we are good by towards a new normality, and that things like face masks and distancing will be pet of that new normality. That being said, for our daily lives, it made a great difference moving to phase 2. And phase 3 will be so much better. I think everyone's short term goals is to move to the next phase. Then, being in phase 3, it will not matters that much of there are a few isolated incidents that are well under control. But right now, those incidents are what are preventing Habana from moving form 1 to 2. As for phase 3, who knows..."
"“There are 5 criterias to help the governers decide if their province can switch from one phase to an other.”What are these criteria’s?

You have all the details here:cubadebate.cu/noticias/…
"What a timely discussion. This just in five hours agoWorld Health Organization officials said Friday that it’s “very unlikely” countries across the globe can eradicate the coronavirus and may need to reinstate some lockdown measure as clusters of cases quickly become outbreaks that spread like “a forest fire.” While some countries and island states have been effective in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, there’s “always the risk” the disease can spread quickly when its imported from other countries, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program, said at a news conference at the organization’s Geneva headquarters Friday. “In our current situation, it is very unlikely that we can eradicate or eliminate this virus,” Ryan said. “We’ve seen countries that have managed to get to zero or almost zero re-import virus from outside, so there’s always a risk.”"
"Cubans are smart to start implementing phase criteria, considering the island’s economic reliance on tourism.Gengen, so well put! I love this quote from Rousseau:‘individual self-interest may speak to [a person] quite differently from how the common interest does.""We will be playing Covid whack a mole for a long time to come."
"<< “In our current situation, it is very unlikely that we can eradicate or eliminate this virus,” Ryan said. “We’ve seen countries that have managed to get to zero or almost zero re-import virus from outside, so there’s always a risk.” >>Here in the "" Atlantic Bubble "" we have seen that also. From 0 cases reported to 3,4, 5 cases, and I believe that almost all of those cases have "" Come From Away "" ."
thank you all for your information and updates. stay wellcarol e.we had 80 deaths in one long term care unit just a mile or so from us. and it was an Extendicare parent company which is not named in the news after giving them 10.7 million dollars recently which they gave to investors. we live in sad times in ontario
"Yes. Sad times indeed. Here, on west coast, our cases are steadily rising. Highest case numbers today since early May. Nobody can claim victory over this pathogen. It knows no borders. Arizona, which has the highest numbers in the world in a single day, is not that far away. Well, nobody in their right mind can claim victory..."

"Great work! I’ve never heard the number of contacts being kept under surveillance term before. Here it’s just, we are reaching out to those or if you know of anyone who was at the No 5 strip club on Canada day, please get in touch. As if anyone would!"
"Thanks, Bellagio for the update!We are all very interested as to what’s happening with our Cuban Friends"
With 4 of the confirmed cases today being travellers returning from abroad I can't see Cuba wanting to open it's borders to foreign tourists just yet.
"Yup, reply 207! In the states over 1,000 TSA officers, reported virus, with 'Over the past two weeks, TSA officers at nearly four dozen U.S. airports have tested positive for COVID-19,' Who knows what Canada's numbers are along with ever other country in the world. loco."
"We need to look at hospitalization rates as Bellagio is doing. We will never truly know the actual number of Covid positive people. But if the hospitalization cases are going down, thats a very good sign. If Cuba effectively segregates incoming people to the keys and tests tests tests Cubans working in the tourist industry, things could move forward economically. Covid is here to stay until the majority of the world is vaccinated."
Re 205 - I am sure that is part of why Cuba has been successful - they trace the contacts. Bellagio - indeed. A lot of the travellers (today three of the four) seem to be coming from Mexico. I don’t know if that is because there are more returning from Mexico or what.
"At the close of yesterday, July 11th, there were six new cases diagnosed. All are Cuban, 100% were confirmed case contacts. Of the total cases, 5 were asymptomatic.

"Beardo. Yep. Cubans are so on top of the science. I was really ill in March. I couldn’t get a test and I may have been exposed to Covid at a London Drugs that had been closed down temporarily due to a pharmacy worker testing positive. I never received a phone call. Another friend came back from a cruise to California. Could not receive a test even though she sat for hours on the phone! This was during the time California went into its first lockdown.This is in BC. The supposed success story of Canada. When people stop dying of this disease, that is success."
"Does any one know is Cuba opened their resorts for Canadian tourist? I am planning to book a 7 days package thru Sunwing in the middle of September to Cayo Coco. Are there any cases of Covid 19 in Cayo Coco and the surrounding towns? I heard that Cuba make some special arrangement. Tourist are not allow to go into populated cities, they are only allowed to stay in the resort , all the tours to the cities are not operated at this moment."
hola Billy! I would wait till the end of August to see whats happening and how it is going.
"It’s weird. Gerropato, I see your little dog facing left, even though he is facing right. Every time! A chihuahua facing left and a mini pini facing right. It’s like that famous cartoon, which animals are most alike? A duck and a rabbit. You see one or the other. I see a chihuahua!"
Billy - I am sure that Cuba would be happy to receive visitors from Canada but I haven’t heard of any flights yet.There have been no cases reported in the whole of Ciego de Avila province for over a month.
Billy @ 213:Cuba is already accepting travelers for beach-front all-inclusive holidays at most of our keys (including Cayo Coco). So on the Cuban side you would have no issues. Your “obstacle” it is on the Canadian side (re: flights) as mentioned by Beardo @216 post. I suggest you keep in touch with Sunwing contact on this matter; and once flights are rescheduled from Canada then may be to come back to this Forum to get an update on our situation with the pandemic.
"Up to Midnight July 13th:Tests: 2,978 (2,367 in Havana only)2 + cases only one from Havana (related to “El Cerro” event); and one imported (Cuban citizen living abroad).In Hospitals we have today 71 + cases. No dead, no critical conditions and just one in “grave” status at ICU.If we continue like this Havana will be taken to Phase 2 soon; and most of the country t Phase 3…I guess."
Should be getting worldwide attention with how they've managed the virus.Well done Cuba.
Voy.I dream for phase 3 like many others.I can see it happening sooner than many had speculated.
"Details of the one case relating to the traveller from abroad.This is Cuban citizen of 67 years of age, resident in the municipality Of Placetas, province Villa Clara. Traveller from the United States who arrived in the country on July 10. 19 contacts are kept under surveillance."
"I might be in a negative mood, but... My feeling is that phase 3 will happen early August, BUT without the opening of the borders. Most of the countries where tourists come from are not stable. The US is a nightmare, so is Russia and UK, and continental Europe and Canada are both getting better but no where near something that would be safe for the Cuban people.I hope I'm wrong."
"We can dream. In phase 3 we could fly into Havana and taxi down. Means and ways ,ways and means."
"It's a tricky one.Any idea when they may make an announcement, Gen?"
"While I didnt personally hear the announcement of what phase 3 entails, I was under the impression that it included easing up the borders and allowing international tourism to resume. I think (or rather, I hope) that would be a hard pill for the government and the people to swallow if they now say ""sorry, we've changed our minds."" It's certainly possible.... but I think if they're to do something like that, they'll simply say ""were staying in phase 2 for now but we will allow a lifting of these further restrictions."" Same difference."
"I know everyone wants to return to a near normal way of life and tourism all over the world has taken a big hit but I think further patience is required and opening borders in any country to places which have not been as diligent in ""flattening the curve"" would be a real slap in the face to those of us who have made sacrifices and played by the rules!"
"We Cubans need Phase 3 regardless of its impact on foreign tourism. Yes, of course, we need tourism badly as well. But first things first."
"Canada is in no hurry to resume flights to the Caribbean now because frankly, there's very little demand for that. Certainly while waiting for colder temps to return here in the Great White North, our new daily COVID-19 case numbers will (in theory) continue to move lower (wouldn't it be wonderful to get to "" 0 ""!). Terry"
WestJet adding 200 flights in general. I just checked their horrible website and only see Cayo Coco listed starting first Saturday in September from Toronto. That’s a pretty prudent approach in my opinion.
"Florida just blew past all records in the States with, what, 15,500 IN ONE EFIN DAY! Someone mentioned the Cubans living in Florida and the Miami flights. I’m assuming those have been suspended. Their must be many Cubans affected in Florida, tricking down emotionally and economically to their extended families in Cuba. No island ... is an island."
"I agree with Voy. People who are in Cuba need phase 3. And Habana need phase 2 more then anything, and hopefully phase 3 soon after. Hyru, from what I have seen over the years, and more during the last 2 years, the Cuban government does not have the same concern over the public's opinion regarding changing what was previously announced. We have seen it consistently over the pandemic: the government announced something, then something else happened a few weeks ago (with proper notice of course).And I'm glad that for the duration of the pandemic, they are acting like that. They are doing what is best for Cuba, no matter the public's opinion, no matter if it means contradicting what they said earlier. During this weird time, the information is changing daily. The risks too. And look at what happened for phase 2: tourism was allowed in the Cayos before any of the provinces where in phase 2. I don't see any problem with doing phase 3 without the opening to tourism on the main island. But we can only wait and see.Bellagio, my guess would be as good as anyone else regarding phase 3. But considering the 5 criteria , it should be soon for many provinces, especially those of the Centro and Oriente. But I also feel that they will wait a while to see who phase 2 is going, at least a few weeks more. But I don't see Cuba opening to indépendant tourism right now. As much as I wish to go back to Canada (or anywhere else where I could buy my meds), i don't think it would be good for the Cuban population."
"Terry, only to surge again with a vengeance come flu season. Or so predicted. Zero isn’t going to happen. Look at New Zealand. But managing and adapting is already happening, looking at Taiwan. And Cuba!"
"Well, for most of us in Ontario, the real test is about to start. Stage 3 is announced to begin next Friday in most regions outside the GTA/Winsdor/Niagara. Those'll go into stage 3 likely a couple weeks afterwards. Restaurants, movie theaters, bars, and a large majority of all other businesses will be able to open up."
"Until tourism to the Cayos has been underway for a while, reviewed and assessed, I can't see general international travel starting. We're almost two weeks into July and I don't think a single flight has come into the cayos yet. I check my Flightradar app quite frequently. To put in place similar measures across all arriving to the mainland airports would be a huge task, even assuming a much reduced volume of travellers."
I’m watching it now. Best of luck to our Ontario friends!
"230,000 reported Worldwide cases reported in the last 24 hours. triste and loco. Actual number maybe 500,000 plus, triste and loco."

And yet Cuba was not included on the UK FCO’s list of safe countries- I suspect that an important requirement for inclusion was that they speak English !
And how do you explain canada not on the list?
"beardo:Speaking English has nothing to do with it. Only a handful of countries on the list apart from several of the caribbean countries, speak English."
"Diva - Canada is on the list. https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi… What list were you looking at ?bellagio - as far as the Americas are concerned, the list does not seem based on how well the country is doing with the virus, and only a couple of countries are non-English speaking. (Why aren´t the Dutch islands included ?) Yes, I agree that Europe and Asia aren´t like that."
Beardo:Canada is on the list of countries and territories exempt from advice against ‘all but essential’ international travel BUT it is not on the list of countries and territories with no self-isolation on arrival in England.
Cuba really seems to take responsibility for the health of their citizens. Congratulations! It may pay off that Cuba does not have a toddler as head of state like the US...
Erwin @ 249:That’s exactly my thinking except that the adjective I would have used to describe “your toddler” would have been impossible to be posted here to avoid my post to be deleted by his fellow countrymen on moderator position. On my happiest days I would describe him as a clown. On my worst days as a….well…. use your imagination!
"Today statistics of the last 24 hours:PCR test: 2,761 with only 2 + cases in Havana.

One in serious (grave) condition at ICU.We have now 66+ cases hospitalized.Since March 11th we have had 2,440 + cases and today 2,285 (94%) are back home recovered fully."
"bellagio - oh, so there are two lists. And some countries are on the first but not the second, whilst others are on the second but not the first. (So you are not supposed to travel to Monserrat or St. Barts but if you do, you don´t need to self-isolate when you return ??) And Cuba is not on either list.Voy - sadly there was one death only 7 days ago. But only four deaths since the start of June."
"beardo:I see where you are coming from, but what it means is people flying in from Monserrat or St. Barts do not need to self isolate on arrival in the UK. However those countries are not on the list of counties that are exempt from advice against ‘all but essential’ international travel if flying from the UK."
"Nationwide PCR test during the last 24 hours: 3,179.00 (re: Havana 2,171.00)New 4 + cases. They are all contacts from previous + cases.Today hospitalized 55 patients. No dead.

Beat me to it too! Always behind in the news on the west coast.Let’s have a dance party! A happy day indeed! Well done England and Cuba!
"A little about the Oxford trials here..,https:/…"
Encouraging news. Does this study touch on whether any of those who received the vaccine also caught covid (or is it simply looking at the bodies response at this time)?
I have serology tests at regular intervals but I don’t get told if I’ve had covid as it would alter my behaviour
Anna. Thank you again . Regardless of if the placebo or not you have decided to help.
"Diva re 263 - of the 2,446 in total that tested positive, 38 are still in hospital."
"Seems all the Brits are talking about Oxford, not really in Cuba. Cuba has excellent health attention, maybe not up to EU or Canadian standards but very clean, and professional. Now ARE you covered?? Good question so check first. As soon as there is a vaccine that works everyone will be vaccinated and jump on a plane, so get ready to jump at the lower prices."

Three new cases reported today Two are female and one male. All three are Cubans.One is contact of a previously confirmed case.One has a source of infection abroad. He arrived in the country on July 13th and was in solitary confinement.The source of infection is not specified in one case Two belong to Havana (Arroyo Naranjo and Plaza de la Revolución- imported); 1 case of Artemis in Bauta municipality.
"It's concerning to see how many of these cases are arriving from abroad. Surely Cuba is taking note of that also. On the other hand, when you have such low numbers, your source of infection from abroad is going to attribute to a large portion of your new cases."
Remember that those coming from abroad are quarantined for 14 days.I am also concered about that case in Bauta - that is close to here.
Diva - the Wirral is good
"Lol. I have many friends there, or did have. They moved away now."
Obviously not good enough for the area lol. Half of Wirral is good . I’d say the west side of it is
Like all towns there is a good side and a make sure your hub caps are secure.LOL

"At least the cases in Artemisa are still only in Bauta - it will be a while before I can breath easily though. A week ago, Bauta had had a total of 12 cases in all these months, and now has had 23 more in less than a week.I do chucxkle at the place names getting translated there - Avila's Blind for Ciego de Avila !"
Beardo:It took only to violate sanitary regulations (re: a party in a closed facility) for Bauta to go back to problems.
"Covid loves them parties!It loves the three Cs Enclosed spacesClose contactCrowded placesFor a prolonged period of time — not a C, but still.If you shut it down, it will just go underground."
Oceanblue .. spoken like Dr Henry and Dr Hindshaw ... it will just go underground and cause bigger issues.
"I still feel very optimistic with 17 cases. It is important that 7 were in Bauta which I suspect were all related to one original source, 5 in Playa de Estes again probably another irresponsible group related to one source, 2 in La Lisa, and 3 in different provinces but all coming from Venezuela (wonder if one infected person was responsible for all 3) Most importantly it appears all of these were determined by contact tracing. You get the idea that the actual number was really only 17, not just 17 that we know about so far as is the case in so many places. And they are tracing everyone those 17 have been in contact with. Sure seems to me that Cuba has this well under control. Color me envious."
"I’m pretty much just quoting Dr Henry. Part science, party psychology. I like the catchy phrases. The 3 Ws. The 3 Cs. Bigger spaces. Fewer faces.But now it’s not working. You should see the crowds on the beaches here! People are just saying yeah, yeah.Yes, Bob, 17 actual cases, not just confirmed cases. Hospital rates are well under control in Cuba. No refrigerated trucks. I’m envious too. We are headed in the wrong direction up here too, just not as much a horror show."

"This is a bad result, the worst for a very long time. Let's hope it can soon be brought back under control."
"Yikes!It is going to be Covid whack-a-mole until we are all vaccinated. This thing is with us, as Dr Fauci says, a little more eloquently than I do.Ship comes in. Whoosh! More spread."
Now...a kitty cat in the UK has the virus.
No a cat does not have it. It is cured.Read all the news before you spread the rumour again.
"All the cases in Bauta, Artemisa, are linked to a party that the imbeciles attended last week in a closed, indoor space. Luckily, all of them and their contacts were put in quarantine the moment the first case texted positive.In Habana, all but 2 cases are related to a contamination in Lisa that seem to have happened in/near a medical clinic. The area is in quarantine now."
They are on it.If only covidiots would hear the message.
"Not according to the Guardian, unless they are behind on their site, Pet cat diagnosed with Covid-19 in first UK case of animal infectionhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/2…Gengen, there was a house party near Toronto with over 200 guests. The organizer is now facing fines of up to $100,000. That would deter a lot of partiers. I hope."
I assume that those on the merchant ship were in quarantine and so that is unlikely to lead to much spread - but us going to make them worried about opening the borders.
"sad to see. As the link says 78.3% tested positive were asymptomatic. More tests, possibly more cases. Like almost every country."
"The Covidiot in Brampton that had the party with over 200 people probably won't miss $100,000 fine. They paid to hire security, valet parking and paid to build a fence around the house so that nobody could see in. I think if you're putting out that kind of money $100,000 fine is no big deal . And that was just one of three parties in Brampton. Imagine how many other parties are going on elsewhere! They need to start fining all the people who are attending these parties to!"
"Cookie, that’s a great idea! You are on to something. Although legally it would be hard to prove. And then you have the anti-maskers, the drum circle enthusiasts, the Covid party goers - whoever gets Covid first wins a prize, other than possible early death.Covidiot whack-a-mole"

Looks like Cuba will never be opening up to phase 3 fully as long as this continues.
"Right now, the main problem is a huge party that happened in Bauta. All the cases in Artemisa are from that party. Since it's linked to one event, and as long as it stays confined to that event, it influences only one of the 5 indicators. More preoccupying (for the opening of the borders) are the cases in Habana, because they are spread within the town. There was one incident in La Lisa, from which many cases come. But the others... So that will have to stabilized for Habana to go to phase 2, then 3.We can only hope that all the Covidiots behave for a while. Many of you wants to come to Cuba to be with your friends and family. Many of us want to leave Cuba to be with our friends and family..."
"Yes Gen, it is the same desire for you to leave as us to come.Oh the basmatti market is waiting for you at home. Lol"
I'm sure your people are more eager to get their basmati then we are. I bought paella rice at the MLC store and it's a nice change. Not as good as basmati though... ;-)
Yes in Santa Clara that rice was bulking the shelf. They have returned today to buy more.
I like this term Covidiot. Unfortunately plenty out there still.The “party” in Bauta was a Santeria “bembe”. Seriously? Then one of them (re: a barber) infected some at his shop for not taking the sanitary measures and he has a girlfriend in La Lisa that got it as well passing the virus from Bauta back to La Lisa.Now many blocks at both locations are quarantined fully (nobody enters) and all inhabitants being tested.
"Forgive my ignorance, but what is a “bembe” ?"
Would it be what we call a baby shower?
"Sounds like the perfect way to spread a virus:BembéOne major ritual is a bembé. This ceremony invites the Orisha to join the community in drumming, singing and dancing.The Orisha may 'seize the head' of a person (or 'mount them' as if they were a horse), and cause that possessed person to perform 'spectacular dances', and to pass on various messages from the Orisha to community members."
It's a Santería ceremony:https:/…rituals.shtml

Spunky and G - thanks.

They have closed the beaches there and in the next municipality to the west. Also all bars in the province, not that that would affect me.Gengen - thanks.

"#349... it shows how the different approaches work in this world. Scotland is aiming to eradicate covid, England & many others to contain it.I'm sure Cuban policy is to eradicate covid rather than just contain it. An island like Cuba has a much better chance of eradicating covid ... it's an island but it also has a government & a public health system to support eradictaion and can tract & trace outbreaks & therefore cut the transmission chain.Look at the efforts to track & trace in England & the US... hived off out of the public system to private companies lining the pockets of pals of the Government... Scotland operates via local health authorities"

Quick update respecting the last numbers:the 3 cases in Santiago de Cuba are from Venezuela travelers. the 2 Guantanamo cases are travelers from Mexico.
And there is now one case described as critical - from Camagüey.
How many tests are they doing per day as these numbers look so low .
"Gato, they tested 3235 persons yesterday. Mostly in Artemisa and Habana since they are the provinces with actives cases. I'm surprised about the Camaguey case. Beardo, do you know if it is someone who just showed up to the hospital in critical condition or someone who has been hospitalized for a while?"
"Do we know if those returning from Venezuela were medical people?Edited: 1:02 pm, July 29, 2020 "
Gengen thanks for the numbers just as i thought not many people getting tested .Here in Quebec we had a couple of weeks under 50 to 70 cases per day problem was they were testing around 6000 people per day .Now they are testing around 15000 and what happens we almost triple and we have on average of 150 tested positive. .
"My Cuban brother told me that the new guy with the virus in Camagüey is a sailor who picked it up when abroad. He was immediately put into isolation from the moment he left the ship at docking, so no threat to the general population.TerryEdited: 1:16 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"Thanks Terry.Gato, Cuba test anyone who enters the country, anyone who was a contact of a positive case, anyone who has symptoms (when they are made ware of it) and they do random tests. I am not sure how much more tests they could do.Remember that many provinces have not had any cases in the last 2 months or more. And interprovincial transport was only allowed recently, and not to and from Habana. Of course, the neighbourhood provinces of Artemisa and Mayabeque likely had people going back and forth. But the rest of the provinces could realistically be Covid free. So I not sure it would be wise waisting money and ressources testing asymptomatic people in those provinces unless they were contacts of a positive case."
Thank you all. I wish there was as much care for each individual suffering here.
"I was quite shocked to hear on the BBC news the other night that 600,000 Brits are currently on holiday in Spain. Now they will all have to self isolate for 14 days on their return. I mean 600,000, they must be crazy."
Bellagio: it sounds like they may have been drinking the US Kool Aid.

Or perhaps testing their eyesight ?"
"Gato., but the good thing is, the percentages aren't really going up, they are staying close to the same. The frightening bit would be if those 15000 tests were showing 250-300 or more positives then that would be very worrying, but they are not.363, Canada is also not an isolated Island with hardly any access to foreigners, that would be expected .Edited: 10:00 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"Like Gengen explained we are testing nationwide an average of 2,500 daily (re: many days we go over 3,000). Anybody coming from abroad (re: plane or ship) goes directly to isolation for 14 days to be tested several times until proving negative. Then it is taken another 14 days to a home isolation and it is tested again at the end so it is considered fully negative. These positive cases while they count for the amount of Cubans infected (re: being abroad) they do not count in terms of understanding how we are controlling the pandemic internally.We test not only people in Havana but in all our labs nationwide. Whenever there is a local event obviously most of the tests go there. But we are not testing only looking for positive cases. We are also testing people in several locations in the country looking for those who may have already developed anti-bodies which will tell you that they were infected at some point fully asymptomatic. This testing system was developed in Cuba (named SUMA) to find HIV in our population; and the technology developed here it present in many hospitals and poli-clinics. The amount of these SUMA tests it is not included in the daily report of the tests looking for Sars-Cov-2 positive cases. Yesterday we had 3,455 tests and 9 positive cases all from Havana (re: three do not count as they arrived infected from abroad). The other six are contacts from previous positive cases."
"I note that with the two travellers from Venezuela, it says that they are watching 225 contacts. How can they have had so many contacts if they were being kept in isolation?"
Could it be other passengers on the aircraft or at the terminal?
Beardo - I think same as Bellagio. All on the flight/airport assistance and the isolation centre.

25 new cases. 8 arrived infected from abroad (re: 7 Cubans and one foreigner). All others ( but one) contacts of previous infected cases from Havana and Artemisa events. We have had no fatalities for more than fifteen days. One lady still in critical condition.There is a tendency of young people becoming main facts of transmission violating sanitary regulations. It looks like this is a Worldwide tendency.

These are all Cubans. All the six from abroad belong to Pinar del Rio province but again they “do not count”. The rest 7, six are from Habana (5 contacts of previous cases) and one from Artemisa (also contact of a previous case). There is still one which cause of infection has not been determined yet.NO fatalities in more than 20 days and today there is still the same lady in critical condition we have had for the last week at ICU.

Hopefully the measures they have in place will handle things and catch cases early. I think it’s a reality at this point that this virus isn’t going anywhere. It’s a matter of management.Thank you for the update"
Though the case in Artemisa province is in San Antonio - which is slightly worrying.I think those tourists arrived yesterday or Friday.

Do it all,” he said. “Inform, empower and listen to communities. Do it all.”Director-General of the WHO Tedros Adhanom speaks during a news conference in Geneva.

Keep strengthening the health system.Keep improving surveillance, contact tracing and ensure disrupted health services are restarted as quickly as possible.Keep safeguards and monitoring in place, because lifting restrictions too quickly can lead to a resurgence."
All the more reason to keep doing what Cuba is doing.

"#389, bottom. The very very bottom I did not include the US because most travellers on this forum are from the UK and Canada. endcoronavirus.org is the source. Sorry, I forgot to say."
We had yesterday 25 new cases:2 arrived infected from abroad2 with unknown source of infection21 contacts of previous infected cases of the events in Artemisa and La Habana.It was announced yesterday that there will be new regulations starting today. Such regulations have not been released yet.
Bauta has been put back to phase 1.
Bad news:Almost 4 thousands test and 49 positive cases:a- 6 arrived infected from abroadb- 41 contacts of previous cases that were already hospitalizedc- 2 unknown source of infectionArtemisa (mostly Mariel) and Havana with most of the cases.It was already announced that there will be new regulations released during the following hours.
Sad news . Let's hope all recover.
"Of the 49 new cases, 24 are from Havana from the municipalities Habana del Este, Marianao, Playa, La Lisa, October 10, Plaza, Cerro and Boyeros. From Artemisa, 19 cases; 18 of the municipality Mariel, and one of Bauta. From Granma province, 2 cases;Matanzas (Jovellanos), Mayabeque (San José de las Lajas), Villa Clara (Camajuaní), Holguin, report one case each.Of the 49 cases, 6 are imported (two from Granma, one from Havana, Mayabeque, Matanzas and Holguin)"
"Bellagio - not sure where you got that. The Minsap site says:Artemisa: 19 casos ( Mariel: 6, Artemisa y San Cristobal 4 cada uno, Bahía Honda: 3; Bauta y Caimito uno cada uno)Edited: 10:44 am, August 06, 2020 "

So how many actual cases ? I mean that have been declared in that advice.
"Diva - 276 *current* positive cases, 49 new as of close of 5th August.Is that the info you're after?"
diva:I was just detailing the 6 reported cases of those that travelled from abroad and tested positive..

"Thank you. It confused me, which at this time is not hard."
Just read this about possibly restricting movement of nationals into Varadero. https:/…
And that says what in English?
"Oceanblue:Here is a translation:The Minister of Transport of Cuba, Eduardo Rodríguez Dávila, reported at a press conference that assesses the decrease in the mobility of people between the five western provinces, including the movements to the spa of Varadero.From Telebandera,municipal channel of Cardenas in Matanzas, it was reported that within the measures (which have not yet all been formalized) of the Municipal Defense Council of Cardenas was oriented strict compliance with measures to prevent further regrowth of the new coronavirus in the west of the island.Among the measures is the country's willingness to limit access to Varadero beach for customers from other provinces, in particular the Cuban capital and Artemis. In addition to the mandatory use of the nasobuco under any circumstances.It happens that the capital has become a focus of regrowth and the movements of habaneros to Varadero, with high numbers, worries the province of Matanzas that is already in phase 3, while Havana is even evaluated to reverse some measures.The danger in Matanzas is dormant according to observations of the government of that province, especially on the beaches, from the constant visits of people from other territories to the beaches and recreation centers of Varadero, Ciénaga de Zapata and the capital city.According to the weekly Girón de Matanzas, the greatest danger is in Varadero, the main tourist resort of the country with the visit of around 1000 daily visitors from Havana.The governor of Matanzas, Mario Sabines Lorenzo, said that many bathers come to the Hicacos Peninsula, both in light cars, for private use, and in collective transport, which causes the risk of re-registrations in Matanzas to increase every day, thus the need to establish stricter measures regarding the limit of people arriving in Varadero.In particular, these limits will be affected by hotels on the peninsula that had already opened and were being kept afloat with national tourism, especially from the country's capital.Although Gran Caribe hotels, according to their managers, maintain strict control of vigilance, temperature intake, hand disinfection at various points of hotels and constant communication with customers in case they have any type of respiratory symptomatology.Cubanacán hotels open on the Peninsula (Bella Costa, Sol Palmeras, Tuxpan and Brisas del Caribe and Royalton Hicacos) also take on strict hygienic measures there that do not yet report cases in any tourist facility even though they have been maintained quite assiduously publicly.In the case of Havana, Cuban capital, according to the latest reports, it is even studied that measures before phase 1 are taken."
"Thank you kindly, Bellagio.Nasobuco, mask, an important new word for me. No nasobuco, no service!"
Re 396 - apparently the original report said that 18 cases were related to the outbreak in Mariel - though they are spread around various municipalities.
"Well, looks like many of the clubs have closed down in Havana again. They were running Friday-Sunday with masks on (and I’m sure some flimsy rules about dancing, etc). Have they released what the new measures are?"
Sorry @ocean ... the one I read was in English. My translator must have been working lol
Artemisa Province is returning to phase 2.
"At the close of this Thursday, August 6th, Cuba reported 54 new cases of COVID-1952 were Cubans and 2 foreigners. 27 Male and 27 Female.The residence by province and municipality of the 54 confirmed cases is:Artemisa: Four cases, two cases of Artemisa, one from Mariel and one from BautaMatanzas: a case of Jagsey GrandeVilla Clara: six cases, five from Camajuaní and one from Villa ClaraHavana: 43 cases, 18 east Havana, five from Marianao, four from Boyeros, four from Plaza de la Revolución, three from October 10, Old Havana, Havana Center, La Lisa and Guanabacoa, two cases each, one case of Playa"
The foreigners are two Mexicans resident in Havana.There are four Cubans where the source is described as from abroad but they don’t specify from where.
"There's some sort of event occurred in Habana del Este - 11 stated to have 87 contacts under surveillance. And two in Villa Clara - 184, 185 contacts. Not imported cases, so more worrying.https:/…"
Interesting the number of contacts per case.... average number of contacts reported by English cases to Test & Trace is something like 2.5...
"At the close of August 7, 2020:59 new cases. Many of which appear to have come from Venezuela.Details of the cases can be found here: https:/…Edited: 10:45 am, August 08, 2020 "
I'm counting 41 from Venezuela. Shesh.
"Yes, it says ""Los 59 casos confirmados fueron cubanos. De los diagnosticados 16 (27,1%) fueron contacto de casos confirmados, 41 (69,4%) con fuente de infección en el extranjero y 2 (3,3%) con fuente de infección no precisada.""All cubans, 16 had contact with a previously confirmed case, 41 imported, 2 unknown manner of transmission."
So I assume that those 41 - and their 180 contacts - are all in an isolation centre. Gordon - do you believe that 2.5 figure ??
Do we know whether these people returning from Venezuela are medical people?However the number of people returning from abroad testing positive doesn't auger too well for the opening up of the island to foreign tourists IMHO.
"Bellagio, usually, we hear about the returning medical brigade in the news. I don't remember anyone from Venezuela. But they could have been on a mission for other purpose then medical. Or they are just Cubans who were stuck in Venezuela and neighbouring countries. I agree with you: the number of people coming back from abroad with the virus is not good for the opening of the borders."
"I’m not sure if they’re a medical team returning. Venezuela has had an increase in cases recently but nowhere near what the top contenders are doing.Trying to be optimistic, but perhaps the officials are looking at these cases from abroad coming in as an indicator of the importance of testing at the airport upon arrival. It won’t catch all but hopefully it’ll catch most. I really do think testing is our best weapon against this virus for now. We just need more (and better) tests."
"I think they're likely to be medical people - there are more than 20,000 Cuban medics in Venezuela.Whether these returnees were a special covid brigade sent out in the last few months - no idea. I'm just guessing anyway.Gen/beardo - do you remember the last news re a covid brigade returning from Venezuela?"
I remember the last brigade from Mexico being back at the beginning of the week I think. But Venezuela does not ring a bell. But I have not watched every news reports this week.
Just heard from a friend that as of midnight Camajuani is being lockdown for 40 days.Waiting for confirmation.
"Oh dear, they've been in quarantine before."
"This Friday the Ministry of Public Health (MINSAP) had confirmed eight cases of coronavirus in Camajuaní . This city of Villa Clara was already under a strict quarantine for a month , between mid-April and mid-May. Now, according to the Minister of Public Health, he will return to that phase, particularly in two of his popular councils.""The forecast indicates that the situation is about to become uncontrollable if we all do not take the measures that have been defined by the country, therefore the threat (of the pandemic ) to continue growing is accentuated with each passing day,"" said Portal Miranda .The official also said that in the case of the Cuban capital, the pandemic forecasting model indicates that ""we are in a stage of exponential growth.""The Minister of Public Health attributed the increase in cases to the ""negligence"" of the institutions and the population. In addition, he reported that ""it was decided to go back to the phase of autochthonous transmission limited to the province of Havana, after having spent a month in phase one (of recovery)."""
"HolaSpoke with my friend a few minutes ago who lives in Camajuani and yes this evening Camajuani will be locked down, police check points will be in place...the 40 days could be more or less depending on just what happens with the outbreak.Now he is out buying food...Please do not shot the message if you disagree with me...this is what I have been told..and this is what he's been told.cheers."
"They announced the quarantine in Camajuany last night and this morning at the press conference. Sadly, some people from camajuany went to Habana some weeks ago, including an infant. That was the entree point. They, people not following the rules spread it. The lack of respect of some people is causing most part of a town to be in lock down. And that is something I would not wish on anyone."
"Holayes, heard that from a few friends also, foolish people in every country. cheers"
429. I have been on video chat with 4 friends in Camuguai and 1 in Vueltas. They are running around like nuts to prepare.Now let's hope they comply.
"My understanding is that, when a town or neighbourhood is put in quarantine, there are police officiers in every street. That makes it really hard not to comply. Ojala that it will solve the problem soon."
"65 new cases:Of the 65 diagnosed cases, 64 are Cubans and one foreigner. Of the total of confirmed cases, 38 (57.8%) were contact with confirmed cases, 20 (31.2%) with a source of infection abroad and seven (10.9%) with an unspecified source of infection.Of those not from abroad, 1 in Las Tunas, 5 in Santa Clara and the rest in Havana or Artemisa.Edited: 10:20 am, August 09, 2020 "
Things certainly not looking good in Cuba. It had been managing the outbreak reasonably well until these past few days.
This virus seems to just lie in waiting for people to let there guard down.Then boom another outbreak.It is scary how fast it can spread.
"But to put things in context, that is 24 new cases in Havana.Yesterday, Miami-Dade, which has a population similar in size to Havana, reported 1,808 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths. Hialeah alone reported 274 new cases."
"Reply #434, sad news but still hopefully manageable, unlike what could possibly happen if they open their 'Phase 3' to early for foreign turistas."
"Hola beardo @437Yes, your observation about the comparison of number of new cases offers some context. While I am no expert in this department, it might also be an observation on the differences between an area that is open to all - including air travel for tourists as well as out-of-state vehicles from all over the US - and that is not even getting into a discussion about the other differences in precautionary requirements mandated for Havana and Miami-Dade.But given the choice, it would appear Havana is a ""safer"" place - even when that similar population size is much more concentrated within a much smaller area.Sadly, in Coronavirus terms - there are no real ""winners"" in this kind of numbers game.Cheers"
That is the part that scares me.Allowing travel from countries that have much higher numbers to enter Cuba.The numbers will go up that is for sure.Will they remain managable depends on how you define it.
Hola 440it should scare all of us....then perhaps this thing will get locked down faster. It is kind of a no brainer....lolcheers.
"Meanwhile, up to 250,000 mostly maskless bikers attend their annual rally to drink and frolic face to face in South Dakota amid the pandemic. There's absolutely no hope for the USA.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j397mUAZL4oTerry"
They would be the no brainers.So many in one place covid will have a field day.The devil is back from Georgia took his fiddle to South Dakota
@442 UK is similar. Huge crowds at beaches.
"Taking a more morbid view of what the pandemic is doing for us (always a positive in a negative)... perhaps this is God's way of culling the stupid people from the herd. In evolutionary terms, this is survival of the fittest... and that means the fittest brains too. The intelligent shall inherit the earth. The others are just playing Russian roulette with a gun pointed at their heads... willingly!! It takes all kinds. I never thought there could be so many stupid people... and we're supposed to be the most intelligent species on earth! I'm embarrassed to be part of the human race now. And everyday is just one more filled with SNL skits being acted out in the US... only they're for real!!Terry"
@445 I can't believe you just typed that.
Survival rate is pretty high.You aren't going to rid of stupid that easy.
A lot of Canadian bikers privately quite happy they can't get to Sturgis while publicly complaining their government is blocking them. Ride Free or Die.
"You mean... ride free AND die! That's more accurate.Yahez, why so disbelieving? Don't mistake the tongue in cheek from the serious. Terry"
And the US government has issued a level 4 advisory on travel to Cuba.
"Terry, except for all of the doctors, teachers, nurses, paramedics, elderly, etc., so intelligent and wise, who are the casualties of stupid."
No IQ test required to put you six feet under.If you get it better to be lucky than stupid or smart
"At the close of this Sunday, August 9th Cuba reported 93 new cases of COVID-19, the highest number since the start of the pandemic in the country, last March.4,267 samples were testes and 93 were positive.Edited: 9:22 am, August 10, 2020 "
"We have been fighting this Pandemic for five months already. Today’s report based upon situation up to March 9th at Midnight:PCR tests nationwide 4,267 from which around 3 thousands plus from Havana and Artemisa. But we continue testing at each province daily.Positive cases 93 Cubans from which 10 arrived infected from abroad (they do not count as domestic endemic transmission) 61 are contacts from previous cases and 22 without info on their cause of transmission. We have today hospitalized 959 patients from which 496 are positive cases, 443 suspects of being and 10 under close medical surveillance.Although all positive cases are a concern in reality the ones that worry the most are the 22 cases we do not know how (from whom) they got infected. 10 are from Mariel (Artemisa), 72 from Havana and 1 (new) from Las Tunas. Our Havana province now back to where we were in April in terms of city lockdown."
Authorities now checking all contacts from the endemic 83 cases specially those form the 22 new positive cases with unknown source of infection.
"Voy, the unconfirmed cases is what preoccupies me too. It means that there is a possible contamination source somewhere that goes undetected.I would assume that the Las Tunas case is someone coming back from Habana and who do not want to say it... but still, it's worrisome that our neighbourhood province got a case."
What i can see on these figures that Bellagio and Voy have posted are the number of tests going up compare to what Cuba was testing before .The more you test the more the numbers of positive cases will rise and it sure is showing in Cuba .
"G - there was another case in Las Tunas yesterday - a child, describe as a contact of a confirmed case."

"sad news, but hopefully still manageable. Not long ago there was only 1 case, and now 20,000,000 reported. loco. f in virus."
"457 - gat0 - that is not the full story. Excluding those from abroad:3,000 tests in Havana and Artemisa - 82 cases1,200 tests in other provinces - 1 new case"
Beardo so how many are they testing in all per day .In the Province of Quebec we have a population of 8.485 million and they are testing over 13000 people per day .The lesser you test the better your numbers will be and that is the case for Cuba .
"Gato, it's not an absolute truth. Cuba has performed hundreds of tests everyday in every provinces for weeks without having one positive case in 12 provinces. It's then reasonable to not do random testing in those provinces.Cuba is a different reality from Quebec, Canada and most of the rest of the world. Here, they trace the source of contamination of every case. They isolate every one who has been in contact with someone who tests positive (sometimes meaning 30-40-50 people go to isolation). They test everyone who has symptoms, and everyone who come back from abroad (and they are in isolation centres since they arrive). Also, anyone who works in one of the Covid designated centre (hospital or isolation) in on a 14 days of work/14 days of quarantine/14 days at home shift. Limiting the possibility for contamination. Cuba doesn't find more positive cases because it tests more. It tests more because there is a surge in the positive cases in some areas."
Gengen Are you going to tell me if you test 4000 people per day instead of 13000 at the the end they will come up with the same numbers of positive cases .You guys had days they would just go over 2000 tests and of course those numbers looked great .This time they had double the numbers of tests and of course the positive test went up by the numbers Bellagio posted .Here in the Province we had days of around 50 positive cases per day and it because they testing a lot less under 5000 tests per day .
"gat0: Gengen is right on point with testing in Cuba and numbers of cases. I look at these tests results from the position in Cuba, in the US, and also with Canada. Cuba has very targeted testing. Actually is a great sign that when they used to do random testing that the results were so low, almost zero. That is the key. I do believe that if Cuba tested more, they would still find the same number of positives since their testing is so targeted. We in the US, especially Florida, have learned that the % testing positive is a key metric. Sadly we in the US are failing that test miserably. But Cuba is doing exceedingly well even before considering how targeted their testing is."
"Gato, I'm saying that it's depends where you do the tests. You could do 100 000 tests in Camagüey and probably get 0 positive.Also, like I said, it's not like in Quebec, where they only test those with symptoms and those who go get tested. You have no choice here: the moment you were in contact with someone who's positive (for the rapid test, not the long test) then you're isolated and tested does. Quebec does not test everyone who has been in contact with a positive case. And they cannot force someone to take the test. Also, the moment someone tests positive, they are sent to the hospital. Quebec only take in those who have complicated cases. And some of those who stay at home will not comply with the mandatory quarantine. The moment you are tested, you are already in isolation. It's not like in Quebec, where people do what they want. A friend of a friend has a beauty salon and posted on FB that one of her client went to have her nails done. What the owner did not know is that the woman had taken the test the day before. 2 days after, she received a text saying she tested positive and should isolate... That would not have happened in Cuba. In Cuba, that first woman would have been isolated when taking the test. And if positive, they would then go to everyone whom she had close contacts with and isolate them in a centre. They already test everyone who's at risk, and many who have no risk factor at all, randomly. Quebec is far from doing that. So it's normal, in the conditions that exists in Quebec, that the more you test, the more positive you get. The same logic does not applies in Cuba. So, when you can trace almost all the contacts of positive cases for months, you reduce the chance so of having random cases popping up everywhere in the country. So more tests in Cuba I'll not mean more positive cases."
Gengen for sûre i would not compare Québec with thé lawzy job they have been doing gère compare to Cuba.My problème is the amount of tests they have been doing which i think are vert low.Bob Canada vas been doing à great job if i compare to the US. Its not even close compare to the problems thé US is having. Canada has 2 Provinces that have most of the cases which are Québec then Ontario. Ontario by the way are doing much better with more population then Québec and thé rest of Canada you can Day things are under control
"gat0., Here in The Atlantic Bubble we're doing pretty good.https:/…"
"gat0 #467: I see the key metric about the number of tests in Cuba is that their rate is so low and their contact tracing so good that random testing of non-targeted people is finding no or almost no positives. I suspect that if they tested all 11 million Cuban citizens that they would find no, or almost no, cases. Quite different than almost all other countries. So the number of tests performed is not a factor. This is a Cuba forum. If you want to bash the US, I am sure there are appropriate Facebook groups for that."
"I agree Bob,Take it out side, other than topics de Cuba.But you must admit We watch florida Closely due to it;s relationship with Cuba"
Bob relax man im not bashing the US your the one that brough up Canada and US if you care to read your post..Seriously coming from you with all the shi# you wrote last week i guess you should join that Facebook group that you want me to go to .Looking at what i posted did i say something wrong when i said not to compare the 2 countries yours and mine which are not even close with the covid cases .Nova exactly you guys got it right from the beginning which is a shame the other Provinces that i was talking about did not do the same . did not do the same
"At the close of this Monday, August 10th, Cuba reported 47 new cases of COVID-19, but no deceased (for the seventh consecutive day)..This Monday, 4,054 samples were studied in the country's various molecular biology laboratories, from all over the nation.Of the 47 patients diagnosed on Monday, 46 are Cuban and one is a foreign resident in the country; 29 were asymptomatic."
"Those are 39 in Havana and 4 each in Artemisa and Villa Clara. This included 32 contacts of previously confirmed cases and 15 others.They have not yet tested all the workers in the Mariel free trade zone.Edited: 12:10 pm, August 11, 2020 "
New cases in New Zealand with no known source. Four members of same family. This thing is so sneaky. A virus without a brain outsmarting the best minds. What season are we in? Five? I have lost count.
"August 12:We have 534.00 patients hospitalized who are positive. From them 6 are at ICU; and two of them in critical condition. We have had no dead’s during the last 8 days.We implemented 4,256.00 PCR tests resulting in 35 new positive cases: 26 contacts of others and still nine with no source of infection known. Cses are 29 from Havana,2 from Artemisa (related with Mariel event), 2 from Villa-Clara (related to events there), 1 from Matanzas (unknown source) and one form Holguin (unknown source).Like Gengen correctly said these are the ones that worry us the most. Doctors friends of mine explained to me that many positive cases still lie about their contacts or how they may have been infected trying to hide something (like having extra-marital affairs). But authorities keep working on them because we do have already legislation for lying to authorities during Pandemic scenarios.In general terms about testing:Cuba tests those PCR tests reported daily which are applied mostly to contacts, suspects and those coming to hospitals with certain symptoms. There are other tests (PCR ones) applied to other subjects (like pregnant women, etc).There are also unknown quantities of rapid tests applied daily as well for a large number of reasons. These tests are not included in the daily report and while they are not as effective as the PCRs at least give you an idea of what’s happening in areas with apparent no virus. There are also tests (using our SUMA testing protocol) implemented daily in a number of others subjects nationwide. In the case of theses specific tests they are aimed not to find if you are currently infected but if you WERE infected at some point and your body created anti-bodies against the virus. These tests are also important considering that almost 60% of the positive cases in Cuba have been asymptomatic. So we have to consider the possibility that a number of people got infected and went through the sickness hassle free and they were never detected.Cuba is also applying daily what we call “pesqiisa” (search) when almost daily medical personnel or supporting teams visit people’s houses looking for symptoms. There is also a mobile application where you can provide your own symptoms online. I use this App every 15 days personally so authorities can save resources in coming home. Authorities urging Cubans to use the phone App. It saves a lot of resources to our country. But many prefer to waste their time and money on FB, and Instagram BS…"
"I do not think it is fair to compare what Cuba is doing with any other developed economy in terms of PCR tests. They are expensive; and Cuba needs millions of them. Take into consideration that hospitalized, suspects, contacts and those under surveillance are tested several times (not just once). We are also testing several everybody that arrives from abroad….and all others I have already mentioned above."
"At the close of this Wednesday, August 12th Cuba reported 46 new cases of COVID-19, and one further death.4,591 samples were studied on Wednesday by molecular biology laboratories across the country, resulting in 46 positive samples."
"Of the 46 cases diagnosed, one is a foreigner (Colombia) and 45 are Cuban.22 are male, and 24 are female.35 are from Havana Province, 5 from Artemisa, 2 from Pinar del Rio, 1 from Mayabeque and 2 from Villa Clara.The one death was an 82 year old Cuban citizen residing in Centro Havana."
"Had 2nd covid vaccine jab today now feel abit grotty with temp going up but that’s what I was expecting .Had interesting chat with woman in charge of Liverpool oxford vaccine trial. They know now that you can get it more than once with the 2nd time being a lot worse. I asked about people getting serology tests and if it comes back positive, people thinking they are protected. The woman laughed and said definitely not protected"
"At the close of this Thursday, August 13th, Cuba reported 56 new cases of COVID-19, Of the 56 cases diagnosed, they' are all Cubans.. 52 are confirmed case contacts. Two with source of infection abroad (one in Havana and one in Santiago de Cuba). 29 are male and 27 are female."
"Dr Durand explained this morning that yesterday's death was a false positive. The patient tested positif to the fast test. But when they performed the autopsie, he was negative. False positive happens often with the fast test because it can give you a positive if you have other types of infection."
"33 of the 56 confirmed cases were from Havana (including 15 from La Lisa). 19 were from Artemisa, 2 from Villa Clara, 1 from Santiago de Cuba and 1 from Pinar del Rio.4941 samples were tested resulting in 56 positive samples."
"The one from Santiago, as well as one from Habana, have their source of infection abroad."
"Anna,Thank you for the update. A bit discouraging if you can get it twice and you're not actually protected. I wonder what influence that will have on the need for a vaccine."
Conner's latest: https:/…
Conner has a great way of bring it home.
"Yep! Conner, as always, cuts through the crap and just says it like it is. Having to back up 10 and punt again is definitely harder than the initial pain. Hopefully they get it right at the end of this next go-round.Terry"
Hyru - it was explained that infections such as dengue fever does same thing . Ie 2nd infection worse Some other vaccines you need two jabs to be protected a hep one for example They said this virus isn’t behaving the same as others - my mother thinks covid was tinckered with in Chinese lab and was around since May 19
"Well!! If your mother says... than hey!! jajajaI have a friend who told me that his uncle said that his second cousin feels that his ex-wife knows that her father is adamant that Trump doesn't know that Fauci's god-daughter was visited by aliens and impregnated by simply thinking evil thoughts. Meanwhile, I'll just crack another beer and thank God that I'm alive and enjoying the sunshine on my deck. Buena suerte to all and have a great weekend!Terry"
"I’m far from being up to date on science, but if this is anything like dengue fever, where you can get it twice and the 2nd time is actually worse, then we are in for a long(er) ride. Last I checked, the reason why dengue is worse the 2nd time around is because of the antibodies... the exact thing which we’re thinking protects us."
My understanding is that Dengue is worse the second time if you get a different strain. That's why a vaccine for Dengue can be a bad idea. We simply do not know enough about Covid 19 to know what if any immunity prior infection gives a person or how long it lasts. And it will take time to know whether or not a vaccine is effective and safe.
"yesterday 13 August, two people who had just returned illegally from Havana were found to have high fevers after attending Fidel's birthday celebration in Biran, Holguin . Everyone is awaiting their COVID test results. There were over 500 people in attendance at the event including the local First Secretary of the Party and the Provincial First Secretary as well as the President of the Poder Popular and the President of the Holguin Provincial Assembly. Needless to say, the sheet hit the fan. I saw photos of the event and everyone was wearing a mask but social distancing was not good due to the size of the event. The two with fevers are quarantined but they are waiting for to decide what to do with 500 including all the power people. My wife is one of those.They have already revoked the license of the driver of the camion and are considering seizing the truck."
"Bob, fingers crossed that one of those was not a ""super spreader"". Hope your wife is O.K."
"Of the cases today, only two were from an unidentified source and 52 from known contacts - so I hope that the contact tracing is working.I get the feeling that social distancing is not as important in the open air.Edited: 8:23 pm, August 14, 2020 "
"i am postind as jacques royplease update status of coro0na virus I am a friend of cuba and have been many times.I will have my biography published in Havana ,Olivo Verde ,Is it too early to plan a launch date, grati jacques r.roy aka Quidado veteran Angolan and South Africa"
"Yeah, fingers crossed for your wife, Bob.Masks are the final layer of protection not the first."
I don’t think the person I spoke to meant exactly like dengue fever but they were certain you can get covid a second timeApparently the trials for this vaccine will end in nov
"Not asking thinking you know the answer, but how many are known as re infection ?"
"That's a crazy one @496 Jacques :) Self promotion is frowned upon here especially the weird kind and in your first post :) Btw...you can't even make a lunch date in Cuba until who knows when, never mind a launch date :)"
I don’t know the answer to that but I heard the stories about re infection about a month ago an American dr has said this. I only got it confirmed from a scientist. I think there is a lot about covid that’s not out in the media.
"At the close of this Friday, August 14th In Cuba 4,603 samples were studied by molecular biology laboratories across the country, resulting in 63 positive samples. Of the 63 positive cases, 60 are Cuban, of which 52 are confirmed case contacts, 3 have a source of infection abroad. Of the 63 confirmed, 41 are male, and 22 female."
Which area are they?
Still waiting on that information.
"From memory, Habana, Artemisa, Villa Clara (2 from Camajuani, 2 from Santa Clara).3 imported cases from 3 other provinces."
Thank you Gen.
"The residence by province and municipality of the 63 confirmed cases is:Artemisa (2)Artemisa Municipality: 1San Cristóbal: 1Havana (54)11 of the Plaza de la Revolución municipality8 of the municipality Playa7 of La Lisa municipality6 boyeros municipalityCerro, Centro Habana and Ten of October 4 eachSan Miguel and Havana east with 3 each2 of Guanabacoa municipalityParrot and Arroyo Naranjo presented 1 eachVilla Clara (4 cases)2 of the municipality Manicaragua.2 Santa ClaraCienfuegos (1 case)1 of Cienfuegos municipalityCiego de Avila: (1 case)1 of the municipality Ciego de AvilaCamaguey (1 case)1 of the Camaguey municipality"
Thank you bellagio.
Thé last 3 were infected abroad.
"Parrot = CotorroThe detailed figures show 3 in Artemisa Province, 2 in the municipality of the same name.There seem a lot of small children - 1, 2, 3 year olds.The foreigners are two French and a Colombian."
"Thanks Gen. I note in those cases 217 contacts are being kept under surveillance. Which country was the infection from, do you know?Edited: 1:01 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"Hi Bob. Yikes. Hope your family is ok. this is one of the big concerns here: ""had just returned illegally from Havana ""The economy is SO in the pits (something I didn't talk about in my latest post because it deserves its own and fits better in the next post abut Cuba Libro) people are taking all kinds of risks to get to Havana to stay or shop or sell - anything to improve their lot. Disturbing times here. Stay safe!"
"Don't know if this has already been posted but ALL the stats are posted here daily. Plus you can search and drill down to the provincial and municipal level, search by date, get information on transmission source for each case and how many contacts of that person are being traced. Very handy! https://covid19cubadata.github.io/#cuba"
Hi Conner! Love your posts by the way! Those green shades make me smile!
Photo is a few years old. Gotta update it. thanks for reading!
"Too funny! I saw what you did, changing your pic! Write us a day in the life in Havana during lockdown. That would be a fascinating post!"
"Oceanblue: If you want an interesting read about life in Havana, try Conner's blog https://hereishavana.com/ She has been writing it for many years. That will keep you entertained and informed for many hours. I would also mention her ""100 places in Cuba every woman should go"". Now that is a book you have to buy but it is well worth it for all the info it contains. I always mention that ""Conner"" is not an internet screen name, she's a real person. And ""Cuba Libro"" is physically at the corner of 19 & 24 in Vedado, a pleasant few block walk from Cemeterio Colon.And, if you want to see another side of Conner, read MEDICC, the Cuban medical journal where she is Senior Editor (her real job)Edited: 3:23 pm, August 15, 2020 "

I just saw this on Amazon! Well done, Conner! You are amazing!Sarah"
"You guys are like super fans/promoters :) Sure we all wanna be her, party glasses and all :) This forum could use some wow right now :) It would be great if she could drop in more often...not just to get complimented of course, but to share the reason why, her raw fresh perspective on Cuba and that keyboard of course :) ""Conner's Corner"" or perhaps ""Cornered ConnerGo"" a title for her monthly comment/thread? :) We all read/enjoy/compliment then f...it all up with our usual bad forum...maybe it's not such a good idea :)"
"@518) a few of us have Conner’s book, “100 Places”, best Christmas present I gave to myself."
Today’s situation of Covid-19 in our country looks like we may be getting better little by little. Due to our experiences in fighting the pandemic I am sure that within the following two weeks all provinces but Havana will go back to full Phase 3 and no cases. Today we had 24 positive cases and 22 from our city. Havana it is really complicated but it is a good sign the positive cases seem to be dropping again…fingers crossed!
"OceanBlue: This post about the Monkey Wrench started out so completely differently (OJO aspiring writers: even if its not going where you wanted or thought, keep with it and let it take you someplace else!). I actually sat down to write COVID in Cuba: Life on the Line, about the extraordinary and pretty wretched--although some extraordinarily funny--experiences about standing on line here for food procurement, banking, bureaucracy during COVID.I think a mash up of a typical day is a great idea though and will put it in the queue. Thanks!Edited: 9:25 am, August 16, 2020 "

"LuckyMe: I wish I could take you up on your suggestion (not a bad one!). But for a lot of reasons, I won't. Expensive internet, limited time (health journalist, Cuba Libro, resolving in Cuba...it all makes days fly by at bullet speed), social media burnout, and I have to marshall all my writing energy to hunt and peck for paying gigs. Or ones with ""cache"". Just pitched The Sun this morning. A terrific magazine we carry at Cuba Libro by the way ;)"

#526 Actually the season should be playing right now. Covid put a stall to that as teams were just beginning training camps in late March. Teams have now reported 2 weeks ago and have begun their training camps. Abbreviated 75 game schedule is to begin Sept. 12 running until year-end. Play-offs begin after New Year.
"Today’s statistics:We have 1,186 patients hospitalized from which 524 are positive cases, 626 suspects and 36 kept under surveillance.4,294 PCR tests finished yesterday nationwide (2,644 in Havana) resulting in new 44 positive cases (36 in Havana, 6 in Artemisa, I VillaClara, 1 Las Tunas). From the 44 new positive cases 40 are contacts of previous infected cases.

Air France are now cancelling mid October flights from Havana to Paris.... but funny enough not Paris to Havana yet..... strange days :)
"Gordon, was you booked on one?"
"Yep.... my outward flights from EDI to CDG to HAV haven't been cancelled, my HAV to CDG on 23/10 has been cancelled.... but is still on sale on the Air France website.... strange days"
"This Tuesday 4,990 samples were studied in the country's different molecular biology laboratories.

In 11 cases the source of infection has not yet been specified, and none had a source of infection abroad ."
"Something has occurred in Pinar del Rio, municipio La Palma. 22 cases. Seems also to have been an event in Arroyo Naranjo (Havana), with 12 cases.Havana still seeing high numbers - 47 today. https:/…"
Thé cases in Palma are linked to the event in the construction company in Mariel. It seems like Palma or at least part of it will be put in quarantine.
"Thanks, Gen. It's a long way from Mariel. Is it the ECM company?"
F in virus. No bueno! F in virus.
This just in! Could be a game changer!https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/aug/…Rapid test could replace quarantine?
"Yahez, I know they said something about which company it was during the news, but the twins were taking my full attention, one trying to escape true the window and the other one trying to jump on the counter to access our lunch... ;-)"
"OB, good stuff. I was also reading about this saliva test from Yale. Results available apparently in a couple hours. I believe it’s what the NBA is using on its players right now. FDA has approved it... hopefully it helpshttps://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/ne…"
Thanks H! Results in less than three hours?! Sure beats 14 days of isolation. 1000 Americans are now dying a horrible death every day from Covid! Just think about that. Gives me goosebumps.
The rapid test wasn’t approved in UK as It wasnot proved it is effective
"Ya right, and apparently Russia has a rapidly readied vaccine also...we could get it and forget it in like three hours and 10 minutes :) One thing that's rapidly happening for sure is the # of new cases/deaths...this could be the calm before the 2nd wave."
The Russian vaccine is administered by end of an umbrella
LOL - sad but true
"Y @ 536: La Palma municipality is not that far from Mariel. Take into consideration that there are a number of small townships that belong to such municipality. There were a dozen of workers at that Mariel construction brigade that live in La Palma municipality. Most of these construction brigades keep their workers week-days on company dorms right at their working sites; and they visit their hometowns on week-ends only. There are construction companies in Havana and Varadero with workers from “Oriente” for example.Like G said a couple of these townships are under total lockdown now (re: Sanguily, La Mulata and another one I cannot remember).Over here all doctors know that the existing rapid tests are good exclusively to determine if you need a PCR test or not. Rapid tests could turn positive even with just the flu. So if you receive a rapid test and it is negative in means that –at such moment- you were not infected by the Covid virus. But if positive you must need a PCR test which result could be negative to Covid anyway if what it turned up the initial radar was a different virus.I do not think there is a need to be skeptical to any new discoveries by any country. We are in the 21st century and this particular virus has put the entire World best scientist to work hard. Time will tell the effectiveness of any vaccines either the one from Russia or even ours which was approved a week ago to start its new phase. Skepticism about Russian vaccine seems to me to be also part of the US Media (encouraged by the US Government) propaganda against it. It is not a secret that if Russia was really capable to bring us a vaccine the level of embarrassment for Mr. Trump will be a lot higher so he was the first one to makes jokes about it."
"#546.... took sometime, but got there in the end :) :)"
"#544 Anna,This current rapid test wasn’t approved by the UK or a different one?"
"The point of these rapid tests isn’t to replace the traditional, more sensitive, testing methods. They are to assist with providing a fast and effective method for detection of Covid in order to allow a move towards normal functionality.Also, the Yale test still requires a lab to process it. It is not a point of care rapid test. These are really the tools we need to help better flatten the curve while waiting/hoping for a vaccine."
There was won’t muted but uk government that would give results in 90 mins but didn’t get green lightI was told when the first covid patient appeared the Royal hospital they swabbed every orifice and that’s how they found out nose/throat can give positive/neg tests but they are finding testing the stool of infected person may get a quicker result
Then the question becomes...how quick can you poop...better lay off the cheddar if you feel symptoms approaching :)
We have 83 new positive cases after 5 thousands (approx.) tests. 62 from Havana spread almost along all municipalities.

"At the close of Friday August 21st, 4562 samples were studied in all molecular biology laboratories in the country and of these 35 tests were positive.

Covid-19: ‘possible’ Oxford vaccine data will be put before regulators this yearhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/au…Could be exciting news! The Oxford group is moving at cheetah pace.
Unfortunately we had a fatality yesterday. It looks like positive cases are going down again. We had only 15 of them after 3 thousand plus PCR tests. 14 of them were contacts from previous infected patients. One still with unknown (or unrevealed) source of infection.
"Details:Artemisa: 3 casesHavana: 11 casesVilla Clara: 1 casehttps:/…Side note, my 83 year old grandfather tested positive for C19 3 weeks ago due to being a contact of a confirmed case. He had no symptoms and continues to be in perfect health. He isolated for 2 weeks (playing poker on his ipad). Now back to normal life -- knock on wood.Back on topic: If this pace continues, Havana should be moving forward to phase 1 in the coming week, I believe."
I reckon the oxford results will be out by Nov But they won’t finish the trials till June next year as I will still have blood drawn till then
"More survive than die from covid, no matter the age. A few 103 year olds survived here in the UK.Always good news to hear recovery story."
It’s worrying what people are left with . A woman in America who didn’t have underlying conditions had to have lung transplant after having covid
"While circumstances like those mentioned by below are unfortunate, they are far, far, far from the norm. Practically every condition/illness we know of has a potential for severe complication, if not death."
"Hyru, it's impossible for Habana to comply with the requirements for phase 1 within the next week. Maybe they will get there within a month, if they have only a few cases a day from now on."
Update my 73 year old mother has been called to take part in oxford trial
"Gengen,I don't recall the requirements from moving from 1 phase to the next. I thought it was 10 days of certain conditions?"
"Hyru, the 5 ""indicios"" (percentages) need to be within a certain rage for at least 10 days. But what they take into account are the numbers for the last 15 days. Considering that today's numbers do not even fall into phase 1 numbers, and considering that the numbers for the last 15 days are far from being phase 1... Impossible to be in phase 1 next week.Diaz-Canel said yesterday that they would increase the isolation mesures. So they are not foreseeing phase 1 for the next few weeks for sure."
"At the close of August 26, 2020:47 new cases.

The cases outside of Habana/Artemisa/Villa Clara are really preoccupying...
G - especially those with no specified source.They have announced new restrictions for Havana from next Tuesday.tribuna.cu/coronavirus/2020-08-27/violacione…
"At the close of this Thursday, August 27th Cuba reported 60 new cases of coronavirus from a testing sample of 5,002 .With no further deaths on Thursday, Cuba has accumulated a total of 92 COVID-19 deaths since March.Five patients are reported as critical and 18 as severe."
"17 of the cases are imported. Of the 43 others, 1 from Villa Clara, 3 from Artemisa and 39 from Habana.Beardo, I completely agree.I was absolutely appalled yesterday to hear that the case from Florida is a 27 years old who was sent to Habana for a seminar or some kind of course for work purpose. She had no choice but to go. Sending people to Habana for anything other then life threatening emergencies is just ridiculous IMO.Starting Monday, no one will be able to enter or leave Habana for at least 15 days. All non essential transportation and work within the province is prohibited. And they will have a strict curfew between 19:00 and 5:00. Fingers crossed that it will help get Habana back on track and stop the spreading to other provinces."
"At the close of this Friday, August 28th Cuba reported 59 new cases of coronavirus from a testing sample of 5,698. Two further deaths were also reported. Five patients are reported as critical and 17 as severe.Of the 59 cases, 36 are male and 23 female. All cases are Cubans, with 10 cases imported."

Still fighting in Havana trying to reduce the numbers. Another undisciplined behavior in Mantilla has complicated things badly. The responsible in Mantilla will be the first Cubans to face legal (curt) repercussions once they finish the neighborhood quarantine.Tuesday will start new lock down of Havana for at least the following fifteen days. Let’s see what happens.
"At the close of this Saturday, August 29th, Cuba reported 48 new cases of COVID-19, out of a testing sample of 4,591 . The 48 cases diagnosed were all Cuban, 23 female and 25 male.The confirmed cases resided In:Havana (39); Artemisa (7); Matanzas (1); Las Tunas (1)Edited: 10:01 am, today "
47 from confirmed contacts and only one from an unknown source.One more reported as critical but three fewer serious.One new case here in Guanajay - only the fifth.
