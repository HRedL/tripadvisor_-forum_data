"In response to COVID-19, at least 4 museums closed. I wouldn't be surprised if other museums do the same.https:/…Edited: 5:40 pm, March 13, 2020 "
The California Academy of Science is now also closed. Had to happen. Too bad. One of our favorite old codger walk destinations.But necessary. Only way out of rain forest is on an elevator in which social distancing would have proved difficult.
"SF/MOMA closed earlier. Once one goes, they all do. And FAM/SF is the city owned collection."
There was too much happy talk for far too long. I hope people are staying home and the people who need testing can get it.The 2-week closes are just a down payment.Fauci today talked about 8 weeks.
"I couldn't agree more with Chriskuo. Everyone needs to just stay home - and mentally prepare for this to last up to two months. I've really been ashamed of some acquaintances who have been posting photos of Facebook - ""Getting one more round"" at a bar before closures. The faster people take this seriously, the sooner it will be over."
"I agree and I wish institutions would get real with their closure estimates and publish them. The drip, drip, drip of extending closures will drive people nuts. Rip the bandage off and be honest. Or just say ""indefinitely.""When the library announced their closure last Friday (3 days ago) it was through 3/31 but they put 6/1 as book due dates. The symphony went from 3/22 to now through 4/30. I think the basketball season is dead.I posted this on another thread but an interesting simulation comparing an open society vs. social distancing in a pandemic. https:/…Edited: 12:53 pm, March 16, 2020 "
