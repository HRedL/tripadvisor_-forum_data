"got an email from BCL group that run the levante club etc , opening from july 1stmight be of instrest to some of you"
"The Dynastic opening 21st June but not much good with the 14 day rule from 8th June which will take us up to 30th June. If they renew it as expected you are into the back end of July. You cannot book a holiday till the government makes it's attentions known if you are still working. As I have said before October looks a good bet.Edited: 4:28 pm, May 29, 2020 "
"Simon Spain is open to foreign tourists from the 1st July, the u.k aren't the only ones to visit benidorm many other countries are accepting tourists as well. I am going to benidorm the weekend of the 12 th June it is just the brits who will not be here until Boris lifts the quarantine rule."
You may get some British who are totally fed up here come out on holiday and stay for longer. Some of the deals on accommodation are very good.
"Simon,this 14 day quarantine on returning to UK Wont be extended.It will last for 3 weeks, then we will make deals with each country to open our borders.Thats only if everyone still does what's asked of them and the R rate doesn't go up.Only my opinion by the way."
Mags....People doing as they are asked to do....Not a chance....You only have to look at local and national news and social media where people are crammed packed on our beaches all over the country..I know the weather here is gorgeous but the longer people ignore the advice the longer it will take to have this deadly virus under control...Shame on all those people who are breaking the rules...AtbTony
"I totally agree mag61. The UK government is already in talks with Spain and Portugal about creating air bridges or corridors, and may possibly be introduced at the same time as the quarantine on June the 8th."
#6. The Spanish government has said that foreign tourism will not start unti Spaniards can move freely around their own country which they cannot do until successful completion of the de-escalation plan which won't be until the third or fourth week of June at the earliest. Not a chance Brits being allowed to come in to Spain on 8 June.
"""All travellers coming to the UK will face two weeks in self-isolation from June 8""Dont think anyone in the replies has mentioned travelling to Spain from the UK that early.Edited: 3:48 am, May 30, 2020 "
"Totally agree with you micky60Edited: 4:43 am, May 30, 2020 "
"Sunseeker, i agree, its not only the brits that visit spain. It must be quite nice in Benidorm at the moment with no drunks, stags, hens, just like the old days, have a good trip."
