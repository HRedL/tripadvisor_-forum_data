Should/ will TCI consider doing the same? I would guess they would keep it in place until the situation in the US was under control.
"The problem is that “the US” is so vast and amorphous that it’s hard to rationalize blocking all of it. Of course, hard to trim down and say “these states are OK... but these are no good.”"
"When 90% of income is from tourism, and majority are from US, I bet they don’t"
14 days quarantine works for me
Partial ban would be like saying they would only ban travelers from Wuhan. Brazil and Russia are also under consideration as their situations are almost as bad as the US.

"There are 21 US States where COVID-19 cases are on the rise because people did not take the Corona Virus seriously and treated it ""just like the flu"". 21 states. Some Governors who rushed to open their states because they feared the economic impact of staying closed, are now regretting those decisions as it's clear that opening as if it was ""business as usual"" and not mandating the wearing of masks and social distancing allowed the virus to spread with little opportunity to contact trace.The above is not my opinion, read some news articles -- I have posted a few below. https:/…https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/california-a…Knowing just how reliant the TCI are on Tourist Dollar$$$ I am impressed and heartened that they worked against political pressure to open and they know exactly how to keep their population safe.

479 thousand deaths worldwide. 124 thousand deaths in America. Bad cold indeed.
"If some feel that the Premier won’t close borders to US citizens, then her only other option is to extend border closures to all and stay in shut down mode. With the major spike of the virus in the US, she can’t in good conscious allow in US visitors.Just as our PM is doing here in Canada. We’ve now extended our border closures with the US for the third time and I expect it to be extended once again. Some are predicting until the end of 2020."

I feel really bad for this Premier. She is caught between a rock and a hard place. Clearly they do not get the proper funding to support their people like we do here in the states while unemployed. The virus can kill but so can poverty. I disagree there are no weapons against this virus- I work in healthcare with many doctors in Manhattan hospitals but it is the early stages and they are just figuring things out. The island isn’t equipped. Since this virus will be in the picture for the very long term a plan needs to be in place so these people can function with tourists somehow. Certain states in the US ie: Maine require a mandatory Negative Covid test result 72 hours prior to entry into a resort. Nothing is fool proof but perhaps having something like this in place in addition to all of the other safety procedures for people who want to visit the island it could be helpful. I have been visiting for 20 years and I care for the people on this island more than a fleeting vacation. I want them to survive and thrive. I hope they figure out a safe and feasible plan that works for everyone.
Bad cold? Therein lies the problem.
"I have been very doubtful that the July 22nd opening would happen, however had a zoom yesterday with a few friends on island and it is plain to see they are opening because they simply don’t have any other optionI also agree it’s between a rock and a hard place and their will be no winner, let’s just hope everyone sticks to the rules and then the island has a fighting chanceEdited: 12:31 pm, June 24, 2020 "

"Polara2, Exactly.TCI should ban travelers from the US. Massachusetts should ban travelers from States with high percentages. As some states are now in the process of doing. Wear a mask in public,follow all CDC Guidelines.Look at Florida. Limited compliance does not work."
"@neapatriots they are not actually banning, they are imposing 14 day quarantines for people flying in from high risk areas.Edited: 2:24 pm, June 24, 2020 "
Certain states are not “ banning” . They are imposing 14 day quarantines from high risk state’s. I have to say I would be amazed how they plan to do this barring installing computer chips or programming iPhones to track people. I think people abroad have to realize the US is basically the size of Europe combined.
I hope Canadians will be welcomed...we are mostly healthy and continuing to improve our numbers. :-)
OK banning was wrong description. Don't get so hung up on one word. Point is they are trying to dissuade interstate travel in some states. And I'm all for it.
"Pepper4prez, that is not likely to happen. It is going to be a continuation of isolation or open borders . US will not allow a ban of flights from their shores while others can go. Can you imagine the pressure that will be placed on the TCI government if they tried to pull something like that. It would take one call/ threat to put that situation to an end"
"If the EU with the UK decide to keep borders closed for the US, then one can speculate if associated territories would also do the same.

Well this would have been our 21st year and I will patiently wait until they are comfortable having us Americans back in. Until then I continue to isolate at home safely with my family. I am curious -is the UK responsible for helping the people of Turks with finances to help them during this difficult time? I just can’t believe people in a British territory are left home alone without work and not financial support. I really hope these poor people receive more aide during this pandemic when tourism is their only income.

Looks like the EU is going ahead with the ban on US travelers . They will allow Chinese travelers if China allows EU citizens. Best of luck to Provo/TCI if they open to all on July 22.
Has it been officially confirmed? I certainly know that it’s been widely suggested and expected.
This post is in the wrong forum - TCI has no connection
"Maca, sorry, it is not official yet. I watch too much european pre-market and they talk about it as an already done deal. In my defense I did say, ""it looks like"" ."
"Referring to post by Dangy on page 1 of comments: The states which have opened businesses and yet still maintained the masks for places like hair salons where people are in close proximity to the customers have done pretty well. In my area (midwest), businesses are open, people still wear masks and there are less street demonstrations of any kind. This is due to people getting jobs back and food on the table and hat means less bankruptcies. There is a middle ground that must be considered because the longer a state's economy is shut down that of itself causes health problems. People can't stay healthy if they are struggling to pay their bills. There are studies which have found the great risks of remaining lockdown due to lack of finances and more suicides, drug use and violence. I now believe flying on planes is safer than ever due to mask requirements, extra sanitation and airports screening passengers. Before all of this, we end up sitting next to someone who was coughing and sneezing and not covering their mouth and nose, which even caused a number of people on one flight I was on from London earlier in 2019 to get sick. Now that person would have never been allowed on the plane (they had bronchitis. I agree with you that some people have gotten complacent in regards to wearing masks in populated places like grocery stores. Unfortunately, human behavior causes many to get used to things and not protect themselves or others. The islands need to open up or businesses will shut down completely and many will be without jobs and no way to make ends meet. It seems it's those politicians with plenty or an agenda who are more likely to keep things really locked up, but they must consider the working poor, and the working middle class who live paycheck to paycheck. They must find a way to open, but keep people doing the reasonable things such as wearing a mask in crowded areas and always washig hands. I'm in a family with someone with a compromised immune system, so I'm use to it keeping things sanitized.Edited: 11:21 am, June 29, 2020 "
Is that actually a place or are we talking time travel?
"Re: #48 You are preaching to the Choir. Look at the link below, now from almost 2 months ago. It provided tips and suggestions, on this forum, for keeping businesses and travelers safe and the ideas/suggestions were met with resistance:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14739…IF Americans -- in their own communities -- will not wear masks, social distance and appreciate and respect the deadliness of this virus (will not take actions that will protect their friends/families/neighbors/co-workers), how can a vulnerable country like the TCI take the risk that travelers will respect their rules and protocols? I agree that there are ways that communities/citizens/tourists can work together to minimize the risk of transmission, but those ways translate in to a loss of autonomy and personal-freedoms and, frankly, and sadly, many people are entitled and feel like their freedom to act like selfish idiots outweighs the public's right to be healthy. The fact that Governors in US states have demanded that Mayors of US Cities in those States Stop mandating mask wearing should tell you and others all they need to know.Stay and travel safe!"
Time travel of course! :)
"We are mandated in NY to wear a mask if we can't social distance. When we go to a restaurant, we can take the mask off once we are seated. If we get up for any reason, the mask needs to go back on. Everyone is complying. I think with us being the epicenter at one time has made people from this state take it seriously."
"Vacay567, I'm glad to hear that your state is taking it seriously. Most in my area are too, but I occasionally see families close to others without masks. For some, it has been the cost factor and not being able to properly clean a mask. I was fortunate to have purchased a very good UVC light device which helps disinfect. I had seen what was happening at the Cleveland Clinic before the news went widespread, so purchased the light online before they sold out. I'm already familiar with the effectiveness of UVC light due to having the Steripen which helps disinfect water in water bottles (when I travel). I found out the hard way that going without it for a single day in some places meant drinking water not suitable for me. UVC light absolutely works. Now that disposable masks are in stock, maybe more will use them or at least cut a cotton t-shirt to use as a mark."
"Absolutely no reason to go without a mask! I can't sew so I staple the elastic band.This works greathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH9LYh3HfiAAs a bonus ,it's a real chick magnet. You should see the looks I get in the supermarket"
licky...just saw on the news that officially the EU has closed it’s borders to the US.
"Thanks Maca, had not seen that yet,I hope that TCI Gov. pays attention . Look at this as a lab experiment!You have a large petri dish(let's call it US) which is full of the virus ( 6 X the world ) and they wants to inject a sample into a small petri dish (let's call it TCI) with virtually no virus and see what happens. What do they think will happen?"
"Question Dr. Jim, do you think that this is the list that should be adopted by the TCI?"
"For what it’s worth the UK is stillIn the EU, Brexit as it is known is scheduled for Dec 2020"
"I would recommend buying a reusable mask which allows inhalation and exhalation. With a specification that prevents most viruses and bacteria entering or leaving. One you can wash easily. I found one the Norwex website and there are others out there being bought and used by friends. My experience is that this type of mask is easy to wear and even with exertion is comfortable. It feels a bit strange at first to wear but you soon get used to it. It is now a habit to wear when shopping (as well as being compulsory in the UK). On countries with a ban on visitors residing in the US, the EU list covers other countries aligned with the EU through treaty eg: Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Norway. So they are also banning residents of the US.Edited: 3:42 am, July 01, 2020 "
"#61With all due respect Dr. Jim, I would take your experience a lot more seriously if you didn't assign the cutesy name ""Mr C-19"" to a deadly virus. It is not a human and shouldn't be given a human identity. In fact, there's nothing cute about this pandemic. I will be 64 in August and have underlying conditions so I have followed all of the recommended mask wearing, hand washing and disinfecting. I don't want this virus and I certainly don't want to infect anyone else with this virus. But the mental health of Americans and the economies of these small tourist nations are both in free fall. Secondly, 12% wrong? You do not mention any false negative tests, only false positives. If I were to get a false positive test, I wouldn't be allowed to fly, correct?"
"Apologies I wasn’t disagreeing with anything you have posted, I think the island should block any traveller from any country that does not have this virus under controlI do believe that the 72 hour test will have to be tweaked because anyone flying on a Sunday is going to have issues getting it done in time"
"Lisa, that’s just part of Dr Jim’s personality. Think of him calling it Mr C-19 as a Dr Jim-ism."
"We can only fly in on Saturdays and Sundays from Toronto and there is no way we can get a covid test done with results in 72 hours. There needs to be more than a ""tweak."" No one from Canada will be able to come. Not to mention the insurance. That is not happening either."
A friend of mine took the test and waited 5 days to view results on line. Not even sure you get a document here. His result just ticked a box: positive or negative.
We are also identified by our OHIP numbers here so I don't think it even lists your name on the test.
"Lisa...No need to go there. The doc is a quirky dude, never nasty or disrespectful. and gets a pass on that stuff. He is also the most competent DE on this forum, and has the medical street cred to back up his opinions. I don't know him personally, but read enough of his stuff. He means no harm."

Seems everyone is bored. None is traveling anywhere for the near foreseeable future due to all restrictions. Why banter on this forum?
TCI can not afford to block American dollars...the Island has suffered enough. The majority of tourist & home/condo owners are Americans. There are US states that have reduced their numbers ( NY for one)
"England Drops Its Quarantine for Most Visitors, but Not Those From the U.S.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/world/eur…"
To answer the question. Yes TCI should block all travelers from the US. Economic ramifications be damned. Until a minimum 50% vaccine is approved. No one should be going anywhere.

With a negative Covid test result, there is no reason to continue to destroy the economy of Paradise.For one thing, I'm sure domestic violence is up. A few of you are always going on about the crime on Provo, though we have not witnessed any or been witness to any in our 4 x there. Let's see what happens in NY and NJ over the next two weeks, if there's any surge in cases and deaths. Those two States will be a good barometer as to the path this virus is taking. Because I can tell you right now, all of the beaches were packed on Long Island and the Jersey Shore - temps in the high 80's -92. And I would say 99% of the people were NOT wearing masks.

I care and pay attention what has occurred during the past eight years after traveling down to Provo and speaking with everyone who lives there. My husband and I are sociable. Trust me, not destroying an island economy; no one deserves that. However, if everyone complains about prices and services for over eight years, I personally decided to check into. Yes, almost bought down there. Not now with what I know. Just go and enjoy. Those who travel, really, to paradise, have no problem telling them the deal before they arrive. I am a simple person and pay and do whatever. However, some of the banter on this forum is ridiculous. Nothing is free (too many pool conversations with everyone complaining about prices, not fun during holiday) and during this pandemic, no one is traveling. It is what it is.

"Re: #90 I'm going to try one more time to provide accurate and factual information. The quantity of tests (raw number) is not as informative as the percentage (%) of people testing positive. And, using Texas as an example, the positive rate in Texas a month ago was approximately 15% while the positive rate in Texas as of July 2nd was almost 25%. That means that more people are being diagnosed Not because testing is increasing, it means more people are being diagnosed because More People are Sick and Infected (community spread). Simplified: If 1,000 people were tested last month, 150 would have been positive. If 1,000 people were tested last week, 250 would have been positive. The only number that's informative is the rate of positive tests.... the test to positive ratio. News/Factual Link below:https://www.newsweek.com/1-4-houston-residen…You need to see actual hospitalizations rise? Houston, Texas was running out of ICU beds and had to send sick patients to other cities. News/Factual Link below:https:/…The TCI has no place else to send their sick and infected residents and visitors. There IS No alternate hospital with ICU beds available. They need to insulate themselves as much as possible from the virus.Hope this helps clarify the situation. Stay and travel safe!"
"Too late to edit #91 but I want to draw your attention back to the title of this thread. If EU Nations, with all of their resources, feel that keeping Americans out of their countries is the safest thing to do (knowing there will be political and economic fallout from that decision), how on earth are the TCIslanders expected to welcome Americans with open arms?It makes absolutely no sense as positive case percentages are rising in many US cities and states. The island does run on tourism, but if the virus starts spreading in the local community, the hospital system will be overrun rather quickly. Once the virus is widespread on the island, there will be no way to get the genie back in the bottle, and tourists will avoid the island anyway.Stay and Travel safe!"

"Dr. Jim, I did find a reference to testing. It seems , in Canada, if you get a test during your mandatory 14 quarantine and it comes back negative it will not shorten your stay in the penalty box but, if it comes back positive , it resets the clock from the date of the positive result. In other words, if you get a positive result on day 13 then you tack on another 14 days."

"Miami-Dade Florida, where the MIA airport is currently has a positive test rate of infection of around 25%. So 1 in 4 people walking around South Florida may have Covid19 and may not even know it or have any symptoms of being infected. The TCI civil service, who will make the decision of who if anyone is going to be let into the Country does not directly rely on Tourism for their daily bread and I am certain they will opt for safety over money. The sobering statistic from today's announcement was one person infected 12 people and they in turn infected 11 more people. If you have a Government job (and a lot of the voting population does) there is zero rush to open the Country up. I am also certain the Government will wait until the very last minute to decide what they are going to do. In the interim Tourism is talking to Health who is advising the Premier. Wait for an announcement from the Premier in the coming weeks"
Does medivac out of TCI if contacting Covid means being transporting to Miami? From my understanding most ICU beds are already full. Is there a secondary option? Does anyone know?
I was reading that the Wine Cellar has had to close as half of its staff have contracted COVID - let’sHope this does not hit the IGA as that would be an issue if they had to close
"Medivac depends on the need and the insurer's medical team as to where a person goes to. The insurer has arrangements with various countries / hospitals eg: Dominican Republic, Jamaica, or elsewhere. Ask your insurance company."
The USA is huge with much more population than Canada or England. It is only some of the states that are seeing an increase in cases. New York State is not one of those states.
"Vacay, I will be heading to your neck of the woods early tomorrow. Western NY is my home growing up and most of my family is still there. If I end up traveling anyplace in August most likely I'll be departing from Buffalo. It's been good to watch how well NY has been doing with it's numbers. VA/MD/DC is also doing well with numbers. I admit there were times I cursed the DC area under my breath for keeping us under ""lockdown"" for so long and so many things closed. VA was under Stay At Home orders until June 10th before even entering Phase 1. But seeing what's happening other places, I appreciate now that they did.Not sure of any of it matters for traveling though, at least internationally. The US will likely be treated as a single entity for admittance purposes."
"Very neat CT Breezes that you are from Western NY.Edited: 9:24 am, July 09, 2020 "
"OP: Good question. I truly bet you have not received a good answer. As for T&C, the govt. stipulates what shall happen and when with this virus. Yes, have to also deal with the airlines. Bottom line, stay in one’s residential country and enjoy. Who wants the travel hassle? Hopefully everyone on this forum are not giving any $$ out/ upfront as a deposit. Say what you want, trying to get $$ back and trying to rebook within the client’s timeframe can become burdensome. Definitely do not use a third party provider to include anyone on the island.2021 is another year. Stay fresh with your $$. Hope this helps."
"#110I seem to be getting the impression from some in here that Canada and the UK did such a fabulous job compared to the U.S.A. Not when you compare the death rates! https:/…Edited: 1:03 pm, July 09, 2020 "
That's still among the worst in the world. Sandwiched between Iran and Indonesia. An we're at the very top when it comes to cases per population (and rising).We have done a dreadful job.
@ 115...that's a funny name..do you speak Czech?
No jasne.
Cool:)
"#115>>We have done a dreadful job.>>I beg to differ. We've done far better than Canada and UK in terms of keeping the infected alive. I think that has a lot to do with our non-socialist healthcare system and as per the topic of this thread, I would say this data suggests that TCI should block those from Canada and the UK before the U.S."
"#119 4% of world population, 25% of world deaths. 60K plus new cases per DAY, 18% to 28% positive testing rates. Over 132K Americans dead. 50 million out of work. So much winning. Zero leadership on the Federal level.  TIs would be crazy to let 'Muricans in the Country."
"#120Meanwhile, China represents 18.2% of the world's population and you believe its Covid death count, do you? https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countrie…"
"Why would the TCI let in Americans when the USA never got out of the first wave? When we have one of the highest infection rates per capita in the world? The veracity of China's data has nothing to do with the topic. I am sure China's data is about as true as Pence telling us ""we have flattened the curve"". While Canada and the UK may have a higher per capita infection death rate they are both well past their peak infections. We haven't even gotten there yet. You can go to a pub in the UK. Their economies are much better off than ours will be. But when you get all your news from Fox I understand your point."
I disagree with LisaCanada is doing much better than the US...just look at Arizona Florida and S Carolina
"Canada has about 103K covid cases since January. USA has about 101K covid cases in the last TWO DAYS. So yeah, we're great again.Edited: 8:42 pm, July 09, 2020 "
"#124Your biased assumptions are not based on any facts. I didn't even look up the UK, but Canada has not yet reached peak.https://news.yahoo.com/canada-modelling-covi…TCI is geographically dependent on American tourist dollars. If TCI doesn't want our money with a negative Covid test, I for one will be happy to spend it in the Bahamas instead. In fact, I am already considering forfitting my deposit and doing just that. I read they have a 7 day window for test results."
"From your article ""The effective reproduction number in Canada, how many people have been infected by each new case, has fluctuated above one recently, but remained fairly steady below one for the course of the last 10 weeks. Dr. Njoo indicated this number needs to consistently remain below one to indicate a slowdown of spread.' The US is at 8 and climbing The USA is now the laughing stock of the world. But I am sure wherever you and your MAGA hat go you'l lhave a wonderful time. Right now I doubt the TCI will be an option but that's just my WAG. But we'll all have to wait and see what happens.Edited: 9:42 pm, July 09, 2020 "
"Lisa M , have you considered Brazil? Beautiful beaches and I hear the weather is lovely this time of year."
"#125 https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases was what I used for my ""assumptions"" A fact that is contrary to your opinion is not biased or unbiased. Nor it it an assumption. It's still a fact no matter how inconvenient to your argument. The article you sighted only adds to my position. The topic is will the TCI block US tourists? I have no idea but given the surge of new cases we have going on I would guess they might restrict entry of US citizens, Will this still be the case by the time you go in November? I have no idea. Currently there are only 4 Covid test machines on Island and testing in the States can be a long wait these days. I wish you well in your travels wherever they take you. Hopefully to Provo.Edited: 10:09 pm, July 09, 2020 "
Lisa Canada is doing very well . Most provinces have very few to zero new cases. Ontario has the most daily new cases today was 170 and 80 of those are migrant workers in Windsor area from out of the country. That leaves 90 cases for the entire province of Ontario. Btw most of our deaths occurred in long term care homes.
I'm not sure...but I think that the bulk of US Covid deaths were in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. I watched the numbers for NH closely. More than 80% of our Covid deaths fell in that category. ~~~allfins ><>
"We have only 4 active Covid 19 here in Nova Scotia which is the most populous province in Atlantic Canada. All cases related to travel in the US and 1 is a migrant worker from Mexico. No spread from them as they all followed the rules and self isolated for 14 days as issued by our Canadian government.We did just have a spread on a neighbouring province that had been Covid free since the end of April. Why? Because an American student tried to return and not follow the rules of self isolating. That was caused by just 1 American. I truly don’t know how TCI will weather this horrible virus. ( and no, it’s not the flu as was earlier stated by some)."

I would have to agree with the comments about Canada doing very well with the Covid situation. Here in Manitoba we have had 9 straight days with no new covid cases.
"Lisa, the U.K. health care system knocks spots off the USA model - why? Because everyone has access to it.It’s also interesting your stuck on the fatality rates and just ignoring the current ‘R’ which is out of control, it’s very frustrating for all who see the reports, we just wish common sense would prevail"

The discussion is whether it is safe to allow US travelers to enter TCI , under the current situation , and why. Please continue.Edited: 4:31 am, July 10, 2020 "
From #124 << but Canada has not yet reached peak.>>From the article she linked << Canada's deputy chief public health officer said there has been a “steady decline” in COVID-19 cases since the peak in late April.>>
"Lisa, LOL. Why would TCI (or any country) care about ""death rate"" when contemplating BANNING travelers from that country due to COVID? They care about infected people coming into their country. Not who lived/died when hooked up to a respirator 3 months ago. It's not even remotely relevant and the fact that that is what you hang your hat on speaks volumes.The US has become an embarrassment of epic proportions during this crisis. No other way to spin it."
