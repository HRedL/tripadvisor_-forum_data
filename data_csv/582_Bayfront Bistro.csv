Disappointed tripadvisor removed Bottomtime's post. Thanks Bottomtime for sharing that important health information with the community.
"It was removed because enough people on here complained about it. If you read it, it says something about the community finding it inappropriate. when Trip Advisor removes a post it reads different."
"I would think everyone would want to know where there is Covid-19, no one wants to get sick !"
