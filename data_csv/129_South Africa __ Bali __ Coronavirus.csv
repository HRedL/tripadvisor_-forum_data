Hi :)Will it be safe to travel from South Africa to Bali considering the coronavirus?any other Safa's travelling to Bali around 27 MArch 2020?Thanks in advance.Rudolf
"Hi Rudolf and welcome to Trip Advisor.Sorry. We’re all ordinary travellers, just like you, therefore none of us would have any more information about how the situation will be at the end of March, than you do. In fact, there are probably only a very few (if any at all) who would even know how things will be next week. Seriously, you are going to have to make your own decision as to whether or not to proceed."
"March 27, 2020 is more than a half month from today. In Mainland China itself the tend of new positive 2019-nCov patients are decreasing. And in outside of Mainland China are more decreasing.Until nowadays Indonesia have no positive patients and all suspected patients are negative. Besides Indonesia you must also monitor place(s) you will transit."
"I’ll ask Greg to get his crystal balls out. While he’s at it he can also tell me what the Corona Virus situation will be for mid May ..... and the lottery numbers for next Saturday.In both cases nobody, not even Greg, knows."
"Hi Rudolf and welcome to Tripadviser,In all the years of traveling to Bali twice a year l have actually never met another South African in Bali, other than my own family and friends and a few on the forum. Bali isn’t a huge holiday destination for South Africans.On my last flight from JHB to Singapore on Singapore Airlines with predominantly SA’s which were mostly going to Australia and New Zealand.However, l will also be in Bali mid March and retuning in April and again via Singapore. I am rather concerned with my travel in Singapore and will definitely be wearing a mask at the airport and on the flight to Bali. Depending on the status of this virus at that time l plan on going straight to Ubud and have already informed my driver that l won’t be doing excursions on the way to my hotel in Ubud if the virus is a threat. Other than taking precautions there isn’t much else l can do and definitely won’t be running away each time l see an Asian person.Hope you have a great trip and let’s hope the virus is contained by March."
"Rudolf,Keep monitoring the news and current status. Also, consult your doctor about travel. They say that the danger from the coronavirus is more for the elderly and/or people with medical issues.At the end of the day, no one can tell you what you will be comfortable with. If March comes with the pandemic growing and you want to cancel, do what is best for you.Janice, I hope you have a wonderful trip and I hope everything goes as planned."
"Hi cat s in regards about the reports of elderly being more at risk. There are currently 5 people in my local hospital with the virus there ages are 44,42,37,37 and an 8 year old boy. I arrive in Bali on March 12. Wishing everyone safe travels over the next few months. Richard."
"People need to stop thinking that the Corona virus is a “proximity to China” thing.Who knows. You might catch it from your neighbour, down the gym or in a restaurant at home.Would you be afraid of going on a skiing holiday to France?Now have reports of Brits on a skiing holiday in France are infected. Why? Because they were in a hotel with another Brit who had recently returned from a conference not from China but Singapore.Who else was on his flight or at the conference. Perhaps somebody from South Africa, even Port Elizabeth.So would you go on a skiing holiday to France."
No one knows what things will be like anywhere in the world regarding the Coronavirus. It is best to check closer to the time regarding travel warnings and make an informed decision. I am going to Bali in March.
"The disruption in flights is the bigger issue. Endless posts from people with cancelled flights and insufficient resources to book another ticket home. Ironically, the reduction in capacity is followed by a reduction in demand so flights aren't expensive. The medical advice is the same for the flu. The mortality rate is similar to the flu. And don't fly congested as the ears will hurt. I am off to Bali mid March and the prospects of staying an extra one or two weeks in Bali due to the virus isn't terrible. Bali is rather inexpensive. An extra one or two weeks in London would isn't terrible but expensive, as a contrast.Edited: 7:37 pm, February 08, 2020 "
I meant more at risk for dying. Reports say that those with compromised immune systems and/or the elderly at more at risk for dying from the coronavirus. I apologize for not being clearer.
"80 percent death of 2019-nCov is over 60 year old people, mainly with other degenerative disease. Only more than 2 percent patients with positive 2019-nCov will get fatality."
"Hi, Rudolf - if you are going to be worried, South Africa is obviously not an important vector ... but where you fly via might be. If you fly via e.g. Singapore where the numbers - though at 40 still low - have more than doubled in the last week, that would be a much more key vector, especially considering how many people pass through the airport daily. Do I think Singapore airport is a dangerous part of the journey, in other words? The answer, simply put, is how the hell would I know, I am not an epidemiologist. However, it seems like a damned good area to wear a mask simply to remind yourself to not touch your mouth, nose and eyes without washing. And also, it might be an area where you decide to hell with the free, potable, water fountains - better to convert some your pathetic South African Rands and buy your own bottle of H20 while there :-)"
"@ Janice, re reply number 4: amazing! As a bodyboarder my feeds are always riddled with info about fellow Capetonian bodyboarders and surfers who are going or have just come back from the surfing areas (during surfing season, of course)... the frst time I went to Sumatra, the place I stayed at was 50 percent full with Saffas (none of whom had arranged with any others to be there), and there were even two old Aussie surfers who had emigrated from RSA back in the 70s!"
"@Janice - I shoulda seen that coming (insert eye-roll emoji here). It was just an example: all those Saffas would have done at least their first trip or two on the Bukit peninsula before looking for less crowded waves. It's always the jumping off point, as it will be for me once more in June."
"Way out of line Janice - all I had been trying to do was point out that many other South Africans also go to Bali. As for your view on the quality of my contributions: perhaps I missed some small print about it being graded by others, but anyway thanks for sharing your disappointment."
"Hi Rudolf,I'm another Safa travelling to Bali for the fifth time. We will be there mid March, unless of course our airline cancels our flight. Its definitely a personal decision."
"Singapore nowadays has positive 2019-nCov patients in number second after China. And has made Orange Alert, one step higher than Yellow Alert means all schools, shops, offices, etc in Singapore must measures the temperature of all twice a day, morning and afternoon.Indonesia has made Yellow Alert only for who are going to Singapore means do not go to Singapore if not very important. Until nowadays Indonesia has no positive 2019-nCov patient.For who want to visit Indonesia, I think better go directly to Indonesia, or transit in Kuala Lumpur instead of Singapore."
"Thank you Sarwa, l think your information is as it seems. Unfortunately l will be flying Singapore Airlines and don’t have another option, yet will take precautions."
"Hello Rudolf, I am a South African living in Indonesia on the Gili Islands (about 2 hours by boat from Bali) for the past 4 years.At the moment there are no reported cases of Coronavirus in Indonesia which we all find a bit sceptical as we are a huge destination for Chinese Travellers and as mentioned above by other people, that this virus has already been carried around the world.I would suggest that you keep an eye on information being released through the media, not just local but foreign as well. (this is what we are doing here at the moment).On a positive note, we are experiencing amazing weather here at the moment and March is always a beautiful time of year to travel.Vriendelike groete, Josh"
"Hi Josh,Thank you for your post.I am travelling to Bali in May and I've been following the news as i am also surprised by the absence of positive cases in Indonesia. There are a few theories that suggest the good weather would make it difficult for this virus to survive, but it still lacks confirmation.Thanks again and if it's not too much to ask, please keep us up to date to the news from there.Best wishesAlex"
"Hi,Well finally the authorities have admitted that an infected Chinese National has been in Bali. But life here seems to be normal and not many people seem concerned. https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/…Cheers"
"Hi Rudolf, I am south African and will be in Bali from the 21st to the 30th March. We initially were due to transit through Hong Kong but had to make a tough decision and reroute through Dubai. Longer travel time but less perceived risk. From reports coming through Bali seems to be one of the safer destinations for now. Let's hope it stays that way. We will be exercising caution especially in Transit with masks and hand sanitizer etc. Also made sure that we have great travel insurance.Safe journey.Edited: 9:40 am, February 13, 2020 "
"are you still going? we are due to leave on the 21st March 2020, also via singapore airlines..but not sure whether we should cancel or not."
"Maxine there are 25 responses in this thread , many that tell you only you can make the decision to travel or not. Some members in this forum are cancelling or deferring, many are still planning on going this month. Weigh up your options and gut feeling and decide."
"Of coarse Maxine, lm leaving next week, coming back next month, via Singapore Airlines. You must decide for yourself as per #28"
"I think, Mac, the decision has to be based on risk factors that affect each traveller. As I’ve posted elsewhere, my Better Half has a depressed immune system due to medical issues. So, we wouldn’t travel even if it was *just* flu affecting Bali. Coronavirus would likely put her into an early grave. Folks in robust health without any of the defined risk factors can possibly reach a different decision."
"“Praying the virus away”. Yes Cat, statements such as that from anyone, let alone a senior government official, certainly is ridiculous enough to cause alarm."
"Two positive cases have been reported in Depok, Java brought back from Japan, this has just been reported on Indonesian / Bali news ."
"It's totally your call, Rudolf! We are booked for June and I am closely watching the trends. Indonesia has been slow off the blocks in terms of detected infections. It does not imply that infections are not there. Iran is a case in point. Also, a crowded tourist destination is high risk as the spread is happening mainly through travelers. And its no longer about being careful of people coming from China. S Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Singapore... By the time you travel, it might be 50 countries. The brighter side is that it has clearly reduced in China and travel is returning to normal within China. It might start reducing worldwide too. With hotter days, viruses usually disappear. Warmer countries like Indonesia and equatorial Africa are showing lower number of cases. Add to that, Bali is relatively warmer in March. So in terms of probability, Bali Belly is higher on the scale than Corona Virus perhapsCheers :)"
The COVID-19 virus has spreaded to about 50 countries already.
The coronavirus is now in 77 countries. https:/…countries
"Interesting that India is now screening travellers from 12 countries, Indonesia included."
"In the big scheme of things I am yet to understand the worry that everybody has about going to Bali.My colleague, who has never been to Bali, is booked for April and is starting to worry and questioning reporting of Indonesian cases but less face it with Ozzie visitors in the 10's of thousands still visitng Bali weekly if there was a big issue, Indonesian reporting aside, it would have already come up in Oz.Ironically Italy isn't far away from us, with cases in the thousands, open borders and ttravel and I have an Italian friend and colleague who goes home to Northern Italy most weekends. It would be probably less risky for me to go to Bali than stay here and drink coffee with him every day."
"I understand what you are saying NotaPigsty.Ultimately it is about assessing risk.What if you country of origin declares a do not fly to Indonesia.? How do you get home? In my case, there are thousands of Australians in Bali at any time, and I am not confident Australia has the means to evacuate so many.It is also about medical care. Could i afford to get sick in Bali? I can in Australia with Private health Insurance, but travel insurance won't cover covid-19 since 31 JanuaryWhat if my employer declares self quarantine on return? My employer already has for returnees from China, Italy, South Korea and Iran"
"I get what you’re saying 100%, Calla. One of the most concerning issues about all this is that in many places flights have been cancelled and stopped altogether. Borders have been closed or attempts made to do so, therefore who is to know what officialdom will dream up next which may leave travellers stranded away from home and without travel insurance."
"Firstly, travel has been severely limited in many countriesSecondly, it has been made clear by medical professionals that wearing masks is useless as preventative measures. They are only minimally useful for containment if the wearer is ill.Thirdly, what’s an “ur”."
"Talking about South Africa, wondering how Janice is faring or returned home."
"""In the big scheme of things I am yet to understand the worry that everybody has about going to Bali.""Guessing that the penny must have dropped by now.Cheers"
She is awfully quiet:)
"Hi,Isn’t SA locked down now?Cheers"
"If Janice go home to SA, she will be lockdowned.Lock down initial on March 26, 2020 00.00am. for 21 days.President Jokowi has announced there are no lock down for Indonesia.And IMHO this is the best for Indonesia, most Indonesian have no refrigerator, not usual for Indonesian eat canned food and it are too expensive for Indonesian."
Thanks for clarifying it’s not in lockdown now.
We’ll be in lockdown in 48 hours’ time. Has anyone heard from Janice? I’m feeling quite concerned about her.
"Hi Lucy, connected with Janice yesterday; she’s fine. Has been able to change her flight to Qatar leaving this coming Saturday cutting her holiday about a week shorter to take advantage of the Qatar flight; originally with Singapore Airlines. Her driver has been very supportive and helping her with everything. And Janice has been helping her driver’s village. Everyone in Ubud following the health guidelines. Cheers."
"Thats a relief that janice is well and safe and organized for her return to south africa, Wish all tripers to stay safe in these troubling times  Cheers vicki"
"""Everyone in Ubud following the health guidelines""Sounds like North Korean propaganda. Have you any actual evidence of this? From what I've seen out of Bali, social distancing is not at all understood.Edited: 7:09 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"I personally cannot verify that as I’m not in Ubud. Along with Janice, my personal Balinese family and an expat who has been living in Ubud for ten years have all stated that the locals are following health guidelines and practising social distancing. All crowd activities have been stopped, schools closed etc. A reduced Ogah Ogah parade only held in each village and tourists barred from attending. I know you find it extremely difficult Post#55 to appreciate any other input on the TA travel Forum beside your own. I find it offensive that replying to TA members asking after Janice you consider North Korean propaganda. I would suggest if you have factual information to the contrary to you post this source. “What I’ve seen out of Bali”. What is that exactly? Please be gracious enough to not remove my Post yet again."
Baliaustralia my friend lives in a small village outside Ubud and has said they have been told for the last couple of days to stay home and isolate. However he told me yesterday that as dangerous things are happening to the village all of them were going to the temple to get the blessed waters and a lot of people are lining up to get it. So religion and belief’s come before safety in this case.
Noted Glenn. I’m assuming they were indoors for Nyepi and I believe they’ve also been advised not to venture anywhere (shopping etc) today as areas are being “sprayed”. I cannot confirm this at this point.
Nyepi is today.
"Thanks Lynne, yes, of course. Glenn, I couldn’t find any information relating to this ‘“spraying” in Snookytraveltips Post."
"As I already mentioned on another post I have seen first hand video footage posted of ceremonies going on with literally hundreds of people gathering for religious purposes. I have also seen video of hundreds of people lining up for visa extensions. Then there was the tourist who died slumped over his motorcycle on the street. How many people did that poor man come in contact with.....Then this article for those who need more clarityhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/fears…in particular this ""Denpasar, Indonesia - Authorities in Bali will allow tens of thousands of people to attend Hindu ceremonies for the island’s new year, or Nyepi, celebrations this week in contravention of Indonesian government calls for social distancing, in a move that experts fear will fuel a dangerous increase in cases of COVID-19.Thousands of foreigners who cannot or do not want to fly home are also having to queue for hours in crowded buildings to renew their visas, creating another potential virus risk on an island that has no testing facilities""."
"Re spraying, i have also seen footage of that and reports from expats who have advised of this happening. Interesting article here on the corona situation.https:/…"
"Re the spraying. While it's not Ubud, one of my Tulamben friends shared photos of spraying there around 6pm on 23 March. They were using a small green cart attached to a motor bike. On the cart were two big black garbage bins and beside them a small (??Honda) motor. Besides my friend, who was in one of the photos, no one else was wearing a mask.He said it was ""spraying disinfectant""."
"If anyone needs more clarification of how deadly this disease is then they are lagging well behind the majority. No one should have to prove themselves or the source of information and may God help those who are still overseas after repeat warnings to go home. This is a world wide disaster. People are still refusing to self isolate and follow recommendations as they come to hand. There are people stranded in many countries, as it stands now and more people will be stranded. More and more airlines are restricting and stopping flights. Many countries are closing borders. It is well proven from statistics that most of the infected cases are from people coming from overseas, For any aussies who do not agree listen to the QLD premier who happens to be live at the moment. . For those that have to remain on 'holiday' or have chosen to do so I pray that you are not infected and get through this as medical facilities in many countries cannot cope with those infected."
"The self appointed forum sheriff reported every one of my posts over the last 2 weeks suggesting that people stop being selfish and get the heck out of Bali, even if it's with tail between legs. Regarding my earlier reference to Nth Korean propaganda, I'd like to retract that. I was wrong as the statement I replied too was more akin to the throw away lines of Iraq's Chemical Ali during the Gulf war.Edited: 11:35 pm, March 24, 2020 "
Cbimages I too have seen footage in Surabaya of men in hazmat suits standing alongside people in orange tops wearing face masks pulling motorbikes mainly go get riders over one by one and spraying a substance that I presume is disinfectant all over them.
"I have just watched video of celebrations taking place in Bali for Nyepi celebrations. God help them and anyone still in Bali. Thousands of people participated in celebrations last night. :(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcF7OwChTEE&Edited: 12:14 am, March 25, 2020 "
Here is another video of what is actually going on in Bali at the moment. Very evident people are ignoring authorities. https://www.youtube.com/watch…
"So, the TA member couldn’t be gracious and leave my Post which was commenting originally on Janice’s current situation which I was providing to those members who were wanting to know her situation."
It's a bit odd that these videos are actually people filming a YouTube clip on a screen. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a beat up...a pretty crude one at that.
"#70 This is footage is what is actually going on. Nyepi Day is currently happening NOW in Bali. I can 100% verify that this is not fake. If you do not wish to believe what I have put up as factual then that is your decision. The only way to share this footage was to do it the way you see it.Edited: 2:26 am, March 25, 2020 "
baliAustralia I have been talking with Janice through pm only. The forum moron police can’t take you down in there. However I guess this post will. Hope you get to read it as Janice is ok and everything you reported here is spot on. Richard.
#69Are you referring to post #53 where you mentioned Janice secured a flight to get home? The post is still there.
"I'm so glad to hear Janice is ok and heading home shortly, should flights enable her to do so, She is normally so vocal on these forums, I must admit I grew concerned when despite apparently being 'on the ground', we didn't hear a peep from her. I'm very happy to hear there must have been another reason she has abruptly stopped her posting."
"It's evident that the claim re everybody taking precautions and adhering to government instructions related to social distancing, is far from accurate, Those videos tell a completely different story to that of Janice's version."
Snotty Stalker :) Don't want to take responsibility for what you relayed to others? It's pretty simple. Did you say the words that baliAustralia attributed to you re everyone is or have been following government guidelines or is someone telling porkies? The reason I ask is that the Youtube videos posted in this thread from an Ogoh Ogoh parade last night appears to show the exact opposite of the assessment attributed to you. Look forward to your report. Stay safe.
"Hi BaliAustralia, thank you for taking the time to respond. I actually sent a whatsapp to Agunk (driver) last night & he advised me that Janice is okay and is leaving Bali shortly. I am very relieved.Stay safe"
Thank you Richard; chatting with Janice privately as you have been plus other TA members who were asking for information about her situation. Cheers.
Thank you Lucy. Everyone stay safe.
"Just out of curiosity, what date did you fly out to Bali Janice?"
It is safe to travel from africa to india on 29 th march 2020
"As I know in India has lock downed for 21 days,"
"Kavita you are on the Bali forum and ideally you should be asking this on either the India forum or on whichever country in Africa you are flying from...however, I think you need to contact your airline to see if they are flying into India on that date and also if you are able to enter India. I am thinking if you are an Indian national you will be able to...do check this out asap."
"To those hoping to get back to South Africa, note that the government have, overnight, mandated that all airports be closed for all aircraft & passenger movements during South Africa's COVID-19 shut-down. https:/…1243123413335638019Edited: 5:19 pm, March 26, 2020 "
I hope Janice got home. Does anyone know if she is home safe?
I might be wrong but didn't someone post the other day she was in Bali until her flight with Qatar airlines tomorrow (Sat 28th)
Post 53 on this thread from BaliAustralia re Janice's travel plans.
"Yes post #53 says Saturday (28th).It seems there is now no way into SA:https:/…coronavirusTravel RestrictionsThe South African Government announced on 25 March the closure of South African airspace to commercial airlines from midnight on 26 March until at least 16 April, as part of further efforts to contain the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). You should consult your airline and travel insurance company immediately to understand what impact this will have for your travel plans.All ‘non-essential domestic travel’ is also banned during that period. Internal flights will be grounded from midnight on 26 March and all public transport will also cease to operate.Land borders to neighbouring countries have been closed to crossings, except for goods trade."
"#89, that's a long time for the airport to be shut down. I suppose that there is no guarantee it will open after that date if the situation doesn't improve. I am sure the closure would be of concern for a lot of travellers trying to get home :("
Will Janice and any other travellers still be able to get their flights out today considering Bali is in lockdown.
"Dianne, I think it may have reached the point where South Africans stranded in Bali will need to wait for their own government to repatriate them. South Africa will need to make special arrangements with the Indonesian authorities for this to happen if indeed that is their governments intention. As has been shown in recent Australian examples, seats on those flights don't come cheap. Some people paid $5000 one way from Peru."
The fact that they haven't banned all flights yet I wondered if they would be allowed to leave their hotel and go straight to the airport for their booked flight.
No they haven't banned flights. DPS still have departures listed that aren't cancelled. The problem is that all airports in South Africa are closed so only the SA government can override their own ban in order to allow a repatriation flight.

"Hi Fresh Prince, I read just yesterday that the Peru mercy flight hasn’t yet gone ahead. And it was a private company looking to charter a flight, Buenos Aries was also mentioned. Still liaising with authorities for approval. Unless of course there was also a government flight that already went ahead, do you have a link for it?"
^ The Australian government are helping to facilitate these charter flights when airports overseas are closed. https://www.sbs.com.au/news/evacuation-fligh…
"This isn’t the article I read and this one mentions Montevideo, not Buenos Aries. https:/…1The article above is more informative than the one I read yesterday. Flights like that one will soon be the only option for stranded tourists around the globe. The people who went ahead with their trips despite so many warning signs because they didn’t want to “lose” their money will be regretting their decisions by now.Edit: I’m a bit slow today...... same article I just linked.Edited: 5:59 pm, March 27, 2020 "
And I really ought to learn how to spell Buenos Aires....
"""The people who went ahead with their trips despite so many warning signs because they didn’t want to “lose” their money will be regretting their decisions by now.""There's no precise word to describe the level of foolishness and pigheadedness."
Totally agree Fresh Prince. No better place like home with this disaster looming and affecting us all. Wishing everyone all the best. My thoughts are with the beautiful people of Bali who will truly struggle in all ways. Unfortunately this pandemic will change us and our world forever.Please stay home. Our health and emergency workers are depending on us to do the right thing so that can cope with what lays ahead. Take care and stay safe everyone.
"Read today that the closure of South African airspace to commercial services was extended by 2 weeks to April 30. I know some countries have been able to send repatriation flights in to SA to pick up stranded citizens, not sure if SA govt has done anything for stranded South Africans though?"
