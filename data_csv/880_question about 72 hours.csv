does the test have to be done within 72 hours of departure? Or as long as you get the results in 72 hours? thanks!
"the test must be administered no more than 72 hours b4 departure.it must be then uploaded to the ed card site 12 hrs b4 departure.so, bottom line is fro the time it is taken til the time it is uploaded...60 hrs.It is difficult at best to make this timing constraint."
thank you. So I need to ask the urgent care if they can meet these precise constraints upon scheduling the test..
"another point for clarification. Ok my friend is saying it can be any rapid test, for example local urgent care place offers one that gives results in 15 minutes. Does it have to be the ""PCR""?"
PCR.All info here https:/…traveler-health-requirements
"Here is what they are saying: The test needs to be a COVID-19 test, obtained from a nasal/oral swab specimen through PCR, NAAT or molecular testing performed by a certified lab, and the results need to be uploaded as part of the ED card process.Any other Covid-19 test (serological testing/antibody testing, antigen testing or any other blood test) doctor’s declaration or home kits will not be accepted for Option 1."
thank you I will make sure with urgent care it is PCR
