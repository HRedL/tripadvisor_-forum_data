"Last February before COVID-19 struck, I bought one ticket for an outward and return flight from Norwich to Amsterdam (KLM) via Expedia. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, KLM has cancelled my outward flight - but my return flight (at the moment) looks as if it's going ahead. Can I claim a full refund from Expedia for the entire price of the ticket. If I cannot fly on the outward journey, how can I use my return ticket?"
Did you purchase both directions as one transaction? Or did you do two separate transactions?
"I have one ticket number and one booking ID. Therefore, this is one transaction."

"""Can I claim a full refund from Expedia for the entire price of the ticket.""If the flights are on the same ticket, yes. It's worth noting that Expedia will sometimes book return trips on two separate booking although given KLM's pricing structure I doubt that would have happened here."
"KLM have probably sent you an email notifying you of the cancellation and offered you options for the next steps. I presume one option is to cancel your entire booking. However, you will have to organise that through Expedia and you can see there are many complaints about Expedia on this forum, so you may not ever see your money again."
