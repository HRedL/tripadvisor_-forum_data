"We're due to visit next weekend but going to make a decision on our plans over the next day or two. I've no reason to think we are currently bringing a risk ourselves but how are locals feeling about tourists? I've been reading about the cruise ship discussions and can well understand those concerns (I checked the schedules myself to see if any docking during our visit) but as well as doing a personal risk assessment of our travel plans I'm wondering how locals feel at this time about tourists pitching up. I understand the hotels will likely not want to see a downturn but we would only be postponing our booking for a few months, not cancelling. Thanks."
"I can’t speak for everyone, but as a local (in Caithness) I am staying home and avoiding unnecessary excursions to cities etc until the situation has settled down.Normally, I’d travel round the UK a fair amount. But with the global situation being dynamic I’m finding it’s actually quite hard to plan what to do in two weeks’ time."
"Currently, there are three territorial Health Board areas in Scotland that have zero coronovavirus cases:OrkneyHighland Western IslesHowever, in a fast moving situation, that may change quickly. Not sure if I am advocating OK to go, or rather better not to travel in case you bring infection in!"
"Just got one in Highland, literally confirmed in the last half-hour:https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/"
"The more people move about the easier it is for the virus to spread. The economic fall out of the virus will have an impact long after the virus has peaked unfortunately. Many people who are self employed or own small businesses have very challenging times ahead. You don't know if you are carrying, you could self isolate for 14 days and be fine then be in contact with a carrier 2 days later. It's very difficult to decide whether "" unnecessary travel"" which a holiday is, should be postponed. Dilemma."
"We travelled around the northern Highlands a week ago, before the situation really kicked off in Italy. People were very nice to us, just we had more questions/comments than usual about where we’d been.Edited: 10:56 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Thanks all for your thoughts, much appreciated. The more I've been thinking about it since posting the more it feels unwise, irresponsible even, to travel up for a holiday. Desperate heart still wants to visit but sensible head saying no!I've opted out of travelling for work meetings in the last week to cut down the risk so should apply those standards to leisure travel too, for both ourselves and all those we meet along the way. I really feel for those working in the tourism industry though, for their increased health risks as well as the serious financial impacts the coming months will bring.Take care everyone - see you in autumn."
"We should all reconsider taking any unnecessary trips and that includes holidays.Unfortunatley many small businesses can ill afford for people to stop visiting, its a real dilemma. Personally i have cancelled my easter holiday and am trying to apend my money at local independent businesses instead. Local butcher, greengrocer, bakery, restaurants, theatre, attractions etc. Ive actually ramped up the amount i eat out to try ans stay supportive.Im not too fussed about the large chains, they will just have to reduce share holder payout for a year or two."
"> restaurants, theatre, attractions etc.As of Monday, Holyrood is banning events of over 500 people. And it looks like Westminster might be changing its mind and about to do something similar.If you look at Ireland as not just a near neighbour but a country with a similar background and exposure, they are also closing indoor events over 100, plus schools and museums etc etc. I've read up on this and their response seems much more reasoned than what's coming out of Westminster. Not that Orkney can have all that many large events to cancel, I'd think, but I too am not a local."
"I'm supposed to travel to Orkney May 9th via Boston/Dublin/Glasgow. I'm waiting a bit before cancelling, since the situation is so fluid and changing almost daily. I've looked forward to this trip for months, so hoping we can get there."
I suppose you know that Trump is stopping all travel from the U.K. to America and at the moment our Government is advising against travel to the States. Best to check out if you can get here or not.
"I'm wondering how difficult it is for someone to take just the odd guest at the moment.I'm thinking of having to prepare food, putting on ovens, electirc lights and all the stuff required. Even knowing what to shop for, what to cook.Hotels usually can distribute such costs over a quantity of guests but one or two may cause more problems and cost than none at all."
"""If you look at Ireland as not just a near neighbour but a country with a similar background and exposure, they are also closing indoor events over 100, plus schools and museums etc etc. I've read up on this and their response seems much more reasoned than what's coming out of Westminster. ""To be fair to Ireland, their health service is not anywhere near as proficient as the UK's, hence I think they are going down a slightly different path."
"Please stop traveling, especially in regards to a small island community. Consider the Faeroe Islands, for example. Cases there have spiked in a matter of days. You can transmit the virus and not be symptomatic. Just please hunker down for a few weeks to a month and let the disease transmission be staggered."
"And you can still travel OUT of the USA, just not go back from an infected area!!"
"US citizens can travel outside of the US and return , however, we will be subjected to extra medical testing upon returning and a 14 day self quarantine. The latest ban by the US government is on foreign nationals from Europe traveling to the US. The press conferences about the new ban were super confusing and caused people to panic."
"Many of us here in Orkney have cancelled holidays and trips south, hoping to delay the arrival of the virus. Please keep in mind that, although we have a new hospital, THERE IS NO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. Considering how quickly this virus spreads, and how it affects people, this something to take jnto consideration. Personally, I woukdn't risk it (and I work in the tourism industry)Edited: 8:43 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"hi Belle, Thanks for your thoughts as a local. It was my original post but I have postponed my trip (decided that before the latest advice to avoid non-essential travel) after thinking about the bigger picture and beyond my personal disappointment over a lost holiday. But you dont get rid of me so easily and I'll be up as soon as safe to do so! :-)It must be hard for yourselves with the risk of the virus spreading to the islands v. the financial impact. I hope support measures are put in place for those of you in the tourist industry (and other industries)."
"when it comes to the highlands in general, Raigmore has just 8 intensive care beds to serve a population of over 350,000, the uk and scottish governments have advised against non essential travel. Surely a holiday is just that, by definition, non essential travel. We ourselves and a great many others will suffer financially over this, but is it not a serious situation?"
"PLEASE DO NOT COME!!! Our supermarkets have empty shelves, if tourists come there will be even less on the shelves.Our hospital is small. If tourists come there is the potential for them not to be able to cope with local demand.Our non essential shops, hotels, pubs, cafes, archaeological sites, museums, camping grounds, caravan parks, etc etc are all CLOSED. There is nothing to see or do. The police will stop you if you go for a drive and request that you return home.Our ferries are only allowing residents to travel on them.PLEASE, PLEASE,PLEASE, listen to the Government’s advice and STAY AT HOME, PROTECT THE NHS, SAVE LIVES. Do not travel ANYWHERE unless it is essential. Holidays are not essential at this time...When this is over we will be so pleased to welcome you to Orkney; but please, not now."
#19 - welcome - do note the original poster cancelled their trip two weeks ago - a hint is to check the dates on posts......
The sun is out and it's warm. I think people in many locations are fearful of visitors deciding to get out and about this weekend.
Really frightened.We had the virus bought here by visitors. It was the shops that got the brunt and where it started.
"I messaged an airBnB host, booked for early June. Non refundable of course. Asked her about the situation. She was super cagey and did not even remotely say we should not be going there. Of course we are not going there, all our trip is cancelled but flights and one other hotel. BUt I was intrigued that her response was not that we should stay away."
I would imagine that the B&B host did no want to suggest that you stayed away as that might open a discussion about you wanting a refund. If you came to the decision yourself you would not have as strong an argument.In the circumstnces why on Earth would a B&B host want to run the risk of being infected with a lethal virus?
"> In the circumstnces why on Earth would a B&B host want to run the risk of being infected with a lethal virus?If brain-dead, money might figure."
"There is no loss to me for sure, I can claim on my insurance. I was concerned enough to reach out to her. But based on her response I can see why tourists end up going on trips they should not."
"""Really frightened.We had the virus bought here by visitors. It was the shops that got the brunt and where it started.""Well, 3 and a bit weeks ago we had 3000 Atletico Madrid supporters descend on Liverpool for a little game of football!Hmmm, now what could possibly go wrong with allowing 3000 people from a COVID-19 hotspot in Spain into the UK!?Edited: 8:13 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"@1PDS - it appears your first post in the forums so maybe you dont read them often but its always a good idea to read the full thread AND STOP SHOUTING!!@Matt_pool, it was outrageous that was allowed to happen. But then with flights still landing daily from hotspots I dont understand much of the rationale these days.I live in a popular tourist area myself and hoping people will be sensible this weekend but not really confident."
"Thank you for staying home, please come back when it is once again safe to travel. Orkney is asleep just now, but we will look forwards to welcoming guests back when it is safe to do so. Please stay safeSincerelyMarleneMy Orkney Tours"
Matt that is terrible!What the heck are they doing here when we are giving up so much to deal with this thing and look after each other?They couldn't even do that in their own country.Money is the root of all evil is a phrase that died out. Seems it's now alive and well.
"It was 11th of March, so there was no problem of the supporters leaving Spain and getting to the UK."
We're watching a movie with four big names starring and it's called Contagion - it's a mirror image of the current Covid-19 outbreak.So freaky.
"How are locals feeling about tourists now? Orkney seems to have been relatively unscathed (comparatively speaking) by Covid, are the locals ready for tourists in a few weeks or is there a sense of trepidation?"
"Orkney Islands Council and NHS Orkney have issued a letter asking travellers for their help in keeping Orkney safe will be given to people as they check in with NorthLink Ferries, Pentland Ferries and Loganair.https:/…"
"Would be interested to know the general feel of the inhabitants towards tourists currently. I've got the option of coming for a week mid August, but i'm torn. On one hand, Orkney has dealt with Covid (as has Scotland generally) and tourism is such a key industry, but on the other hand - will tourists make people feel uncomfortable? It's great to do the right thing- I just don't know what that is!"
This video and page might be helpful to you from Orkney.com: https://www.orkney.com/covid-19
"Yes, a lot of people are upset about suddenly letting folk stream in from anywhere. It's a difficult situation, of course, for everyone. See this page for a more honest reflection of islanders' feelings at present. https://www.orkneyology.com/coronavirus-trav…"
"Many Islanders are un happy about the hordes of tourists streaming inThere has been such a mess left by so called wild campers etc Rubbish, toilet waste , and people disrespecting private land.the list goes onHave a read of the FB page "" the land weeps"",worth a read"
"We were looking forward to coming in sept...we staying self catering so would not mix with many others.we just want to exppore all outside sites that are open,now my wife is worried that we will be blanked and condemned about coming."
"In reply to Kevin, post #39, visitors from the US are currently subject to quarantine rules in Scotland. These may well still be in place next month. These rules state you must stay self-isolated at your final destination, in one place, not visit public places and not go shopping other than for basic necessities. Which is basically saying please don't come here on holiday. So if you do travel to Orkney while those rules are in place and go out and about then a) you will be in breach of the regulations b) therefore be deemed to be putting others at risk in a small island community and c) would be rightly condemned.If the quarantine rules are lifted for US travellers by the dates of your trip then Orkney asks that you bear the following in mind :https://www.orkney.com/news/coronavirusThe list of countries currently exempt from quarantine requirements can be found here:https:/…Edited: 5:28 am, August 11, 2020 "
We are from washington England.....so travel is ok...just dont fancy being treat as a total outcast.
"Ha ha, sorry Kevin! All I saw was United..... serves me right for not checking your profile. Not on Orkney myself right now so can't comment on current 'ambience' but I think the message on Orkney.com I gave link to is pretty positive while asking visitors respect others and respect barrier gestures."
Kevin - you might want to keep up to date with this situation before your trip. If you follow the Orcadian on Facebook or Twitter you'll see any developments you should be aware of.https:/…

"In reply to #44, who rattled your cage? Could you show where in this thread anyone has suggested that the people of Orkney are hostile to visitors? And point to which comment you are actually replying?A link was included in #36 to a rather nice video put together in Orkney to show that visitors are welcome but they are asked to respect any guidelines in place and all barrier gestures. If you had read the link in my post #43 you would have seen that there has been a local outbreak this week so your wee rant is both a bit out of place just now and doesn't reflect the discussion in the rest of this thread."

"#47 - there is nothing in my post to suggest I'm not perfectly calm. I wasn't the one that went off on a rant. It was you who introduced the concept of ""hostile behaviour"" into the discussion. Posters were seeking to guage how welcome they might be. Your comments and language could easily suggest to someone reading the most recent posts they could expect a hostile reception in Orkney - which is the place about which the question of welcome was posed and where the local tourist industry has worked hard to put out a postive message. If your comments relate to other discussions or places then go make them there. I didn't read anything in or into your post other than what you actually wrote."
