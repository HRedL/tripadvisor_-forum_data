"Hi, I was just wondering if Hvar town is open like normal now? I am looking to come to Hvar in August, so a little while yet. But interested to know if bars, restaurants, boat trips etc are now open? ThanksEmily"
Pretty much deserted. Been to the island today.
I have booked to visit Croatia in the second half of August. Do you think things will have improved by then? Was hoping to put Hvar on my itinerary.
"Please post how you get on in August , Iâ€™m due in September , have a great time !"
"Thanks for everyones comments, I am hoping things improve for Hvar now that places like the UK have done an 'air corridor' to Croatia. When I was looking at flights into split, most of the seats had been booked! I am also looking at the second half of august for booking, so fingers are crossed! xx"
"Hi, potentially looking at booking 5 nights in Hvar in August. Just wondering if there's any updates since the previous posted on here from 2/3 weeks ago? Wouldn't mind if it's a little quieter than usual but would still like ost of the restaurants and bars to be open with a lively atmosphere."
I was just there - quieter than usual but enough places open to make it lively enough - I had a great time
"Further update. I was there the last week. It's lively, there's people around, clubs are working.Hvar is usually packed so much you can barely walk around, so this change is actually a bit refreshing!"
"Great to hear , was Carp Diem open ? Clubs etc Thanks in advance"
"Yes, Carpe Diem is working as usual. Not sure about the remote bar on the island next to Hvar, but the club in the center is working."
