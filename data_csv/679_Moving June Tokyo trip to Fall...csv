"We will be moving our early June Tokyo trip and are trying to decide when in the fall to go. We want to give a few months between then and now for the pandemic to sort itself out, so we are thinking end of September or early October. Is there much of a difference weather-wise? Or anything else that would sway our choice between end of September or early october? We don't want it to get too cold. Of course - hopefully this rescheduling doesn't need to be rescheduled again, but who knows."
"Hi! I was in the same boat, I had travel scheduled for late April and rescheduled to late October - early November. Hoping that holds.I think that late September early Oct is still technically typhoon season, though the chances of one hitting are reduced, IIRC. From what I've read, it tends to still be a little warm then with temps around 70s or even 80s Fahrenheit.I think it also depends where in Japan."
Tokyo! For 6 days.
No kidding .. same here. I'm slated to travel to Tokyo for 7 days! I figure worst case I can't go late Oct I'll have to reschedule to mid-May 2021.
"The number of COVID-19 positive cases in the US is extremely slow to go down at the moment. I wouldn't plan any trip to Japan for a long time. Japan is not going to let people from the US enter unless the number goes way down. I go to Japan every December, but I'm not counting on that this year. As mentioned, if you're going to book a trip, make sure everything is refundable and cancellable without a fee."
"September can still be very hot (and October can be as well), but the temperatures and weather in October is nicer IMO."
"October is better than September. Both months still see a risk of typhoons but that's something you can't control. If you are from Florida, Tokyo should be more than bearable in the fall.As to chances of you being able to travel, I would rate it as 30%. As suggested, whatever you book, make sure it's 100% refundable. You don't want to be stuck with changed airline or hotel bookings that only allow you to change dates or get vouchers. Who knows whether they will still be in business a few months down the road!"
The autumn foliage in Tokyo is usually late November. I hope the medicines for COVID-19 proove to be effective by then.
