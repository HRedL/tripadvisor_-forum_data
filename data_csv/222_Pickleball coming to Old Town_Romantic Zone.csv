"Greeting to all!While we play at the Westin Hotel near the marina and other areas, it's time to introduce the game to the locals in Old Town! Also, there are so many tourists that love the game or would if they tried it. The game is a mix of several sports like tennis, table tennis, badminton, and racquetball. So, we need a nice flat surface of about 30 feet by 60 feet. A local tennis court or basketball court would be great but an alternate area will work. There will also be varying levels of play at the Westin starting mid-November. I'll be bringing the necessary equipment to play, who out there can help find a nice spot?WARNING -- This is a very addictive game for all ages"
"There’s a basketball court on Rio Calle in Colonia Remance just west of the tunnel road that doesn’t appear to be used much. I’ve seen the occasional exercise class there in the mornings, but that’s it. If you know the Red Cabbage restaurant, it’s east of that, maybe two blocks. There’s also a soccer court in El Caloso near the Rivera Cuale Condominios on Atmósfera. If you need help finding either suggestion, PM me."
That's awesome news I'm hoping the surface conditions are in reasonable shape -- I'll check them out once I arrive. I appreciate your reply and maybe others will chime in as well.
I am interested in playing. I wanted to take up Pickleball last year but the Marina was a long bus ride away.
Please be sure to update with the when and where as plans are finalized.
"We would love to play,November 27- dec 7"
"I’d be more than happy if the Sheraton, Canto Del Sol, Los Tules or someone other than at the Marina would convert a tennis court to a couple of pickleball courts. I refuse to go out to the Marina to play."
"Well not officially old town/ZR but closer than the Marina, have you checked at the Sports Stadium (across from the Sheraton)? Lots of different types of large flat surfaces there. Some even under cover."
"Pickleball used to be at the Canto del Sol, but the resort didn’t want it there anymore, hence now playing in the Marina area."
WWW8 & Suze2u -- thanks for the info -- I might need a little more data as I'm trying to find them on Google maps. If any others on this thread are in town and close by these places it would nice if I had photos of the surfaces etc. to make sure they'll work. Excited to get back to PV -- 4 times last year!We'll still be playing at the Westin as there's a nice set up there with varying skill levels and friendly players but it will be nice to have a place near Old Town too so we can introduce the game and have some fun play
"https:/…You can see the Sports Stadium location here. It shows as just one big green area on the map, but in reality there is a running track, basketball courts, various level surfaces (i've done Zumba on a large flat cement patio which is under cover). There is an office on-site near the rest rooms, that I am guessing is where you'd find about signing up for use of the spaces. It's a busy local place with young people sports teams practicing, cheerleading, runners, etc. so not sure how availability works."

"Pickelballers, Just for additional info, we play on cement basketball courts in Bucerias, going widthways we were able to put in 3 courts. Started with duct taping the lines at first. The surface isn’t perfect, expansion joints cause what we call the Bucerias bounce, but it’s equal for both teams, and it’s better than driving into PV, which we used to do. While a covered surface sounds good, it may be too low for play, lobs etc. Good luck in getting it started, we now had over 350 different people playing Bucerias last season."
Staduim courts are used frequently.El Remance court is rarely in use. A few morning fitness classes and kids playing right after school is let out.
"Alberta Traveler -- did you play at the Westin as I played there a few times and played in the last Tourney too. Nice set up there Bonnie does a great job! I'd like to come play with you in November and check it out.We stay more near Old Town but love the whole area. I'd like to go to a school in the area and show them this sport - I'd like to bring the game to the local school(s)and I'll have some gear with me. Perhaps some on this thread know of a good place to start. I have a paddle company that will help with paddles and I'm working on getting nets and balls.Edited: 7:45 pm, October 17, 2019 "
"Pickleballers, no we didn’t play at the Westin but know Bonnie well and we were watching at the tournament as we also know the Manta people who played. Bonnie also sells Manta paddles and equipment. You’re welcome to come play in Bucerias in Nov and Dec. after that it’s pretty full with registered members. PM me for more details. There is also the FB page which has info."
"I'm a 4.0 rated player and will be in the area in early Nov. 2019, if there are any pickleball games going on please send me a PM. The only weekly scheduled social games (meaning where anyone can drop in and play) that I'm aware of are weekdays in San Miguel de Allende."
"Umightaswell, go to the Facebook page Pickleball PV at the Westin."
Los Tules has aalready converted one of their tennis courts to pickleball.
"kcowan ... do you know if the Los Tules conversion resulted in one or two pickleball courts? Are they open to the public and, if so, any idea how much they charge?"
"I just now confirmed, no play at Los Tules - It'll start up mid-November at The Westin. Not sure about Melia or Bucerias perhaps others will chime in here. I'm bringing a net, paddles, blue tape and balls checking out a few places between Old Town and the sports stadium."
Hey all: just wondering if a new location was found in old town? With the Melia now shutdown due to COVID-19 wondering if there’s someplace else to play. Thanks!
"Kinder - What do you mean by ""with the Melia shut down due to COVID-19""?"
The organizers of PB at the Melia posted on Facebook that they are canceling effective today due to the Corona virus. My guess is it’s an abundance of caution to help stop any spread or foothold.
Thanks For the explanation kinder.
"I think the season is probably over, and would have ended at the end of March anyway."
