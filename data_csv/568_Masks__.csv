"I have been watching live videos on You Tube of the streets of Parls (yes, they were filmed within the last few weeks) and I am noticing that hardly anyone is wearing masks on the streets and hardly any social distancing is happening. It is a little concerning as the streets seem quite busy .. I know that masks are probably not ""mandatory"" because you're outside BUT oh my goodness, the amount of people I saw on these streets, not wearing masks or social distancing was alarming ..What are the rules in Paris right now for mask wearing and social distancing?"
"Watch for news, from France, in the next few days as ""mask"" restrictions may be tightened. How heavily Rules are enforced is something else again.Keep wellAnthony K"

"Masks are mandatory in all indoor spaces. At bars, cafés and restos you were them upon entry, take them off when seated and put them on if using the toilets. The rule has been extended to certain outdoor spaces/areas and further outdoor spaces will likely have mask requirements in upcoming days. The problem is lack of enforcement of mask rules. You may have seen people on streets without masks on youtube but IME ""most"" people wear them in indoor locations."
Barely anybody is wearing a mask on the street and people will definitely get in your personal bubble. If this will make you uncomfortable it is probably not the best time to come.I was at Fontainebleau market yesterday and frankly I was not at all comfortable with the crowd.
"In my own neighbourhood in Paris about 70% of the people are wearing masks at all times, and they ALL are wearing masks if they are heading for the bus stop or the metro station. In any case, they have to wear a mask to go into any shop for any reason.People in the suburbs are weird. Do not go there."
"Um, this poster lives in a suburb just outside Paris where everyone entering a store, or attending a street market or using public transport is wearing a mask. However, I have noticed a lack of mask wearers in bars, restos and cafés in my town the same as I have in Paris. Just sayin'."
YouTube: Berlin COVID-19 protests against masks and sort by this week... depending on who is reporting these city dwellers number in the tens of thousands.Holland is in the news too on tossing the masks in the Amstel. I'm walking in the center of Nice City right now where there is a mandatory mask requirement and maybe 5% are wearing them.Italy was the same this past week.
I will be happy to stay in my obedient neighbourhood most of the time. It looks like at lot of these places have a death wish.
"Off topic (sorry, it happens) but I read a news article yesterday where Dutch researchers said masks were inefficient. The main reason being that people use them improperly, so no one is wearing masks apparently. Not a single word about whether properly wearing a mask is effective."
"London is ablaze with more colour in fabric masks than you see in fashions. Most people have a tendency to wear them from their front door until home again, when going on, say, a shopping trip. As for London Underground and working staff I cannot say. London Overground is quiet with mask-wearing staff. The inclination is not there, in my local supermarkets, to enforce mask wearing ... this could be down to losses made during lockdown. I seem to get the feeling that the situation in Paris is masks off outdoors, masks on indoors ... as a general rule.One question ... Are there any daily reports of fines being administered to those breaking the Rules ... say on Public Transport?Keep well allAnthony K"
"""I seem to get the feeling that the situation in Paris is masks off outdoors, masks on indoors ... as a general rule.""I hope it stays like that. I will be in Paris for 6 days starting this saturday and wearing a mask outside will take away a lot of fun."
The rules are about to change for outdoors in a lot of Paris imminently.
"The outdoor areas that may be targeted are shopping streets, the banks of the river Seine, parks and gardens, open food markets and all areas where tourists or Parisians have to stand in line.Keep well allAnthony KEdited: 7:23 am, August 06, 2020 "
"Mask over your nose, mask down round your neck may well become like playing with a yo-yo.""No-one is yet wearing a facemask 100% of the time,"" from a friend in Nice. Anthony KEdited: 7:28 am, August 06, 2020 "
Hopefully very heavy fines will be given to people who refuse to wear masks when they should be wearing them. If people can't/won't wear a mask then they should stay away from places that require them. It is very simple and doesn't require a a lot of discussion.
"The best argument that I have heard supporting the wearing of masks is the case of two Belgian hairdressers who were tested (for reasons unconnected with their profession) and found to be Covid-19 positive. Between them they had had 139 clients during the risk period and all those 139 were subsequently tested, not one was Covid-19 positive. Having one's hair cut would seem to be about as high risk as it gets yet here we have a clear example of the infection not being passed on when both parties wear masks. The experts here say that if both parties are wearing masks, the risk is reduced by a factor of between 50 and 100. If one practises social distancing to the extent that it is practical (and certainly for any prolonged period of time) as well as wearing a mask, the risk starts to be reduced close to the level of the risk of being involved in a road accident."
"because ...Three weeks ago, to the day, I had my haircut, dramatically, and my beard trimmed, even more dramatically. For obvious reasons I could not wear a face-mask. Neither did the young Barber. I have no Flu symptoms.Keep well.Anthony K"
I'm still waiting for the official list of the outdoor mask areas for Paris. There is certainly quite a bit of haggling with the city council and the préfecture. Both entities are well aware that Parisians (and everybody else) are suffering from mask fatigue and shouldn't be pushed too far.
"k2Is there a worry about people taking to the streets in a ""no-mask"" protest. The French are not shy of demonstrating.CheersAnthony"
"No, there is not."
"The majority of the French understand the mask rules and support them. Of course, being French, there are occasions when they decide that they can be exempted from certain details. And so the virus is still spreading."
"Anthony, I am very surprised by your haircut experience. I have been to the hairdresser’s twice since lockdown ended. I wore a mask for the cut and the color, as did my hairdresser and the colorist. Hand gel was applied when I entered and the first time I went, I had to take off my mask and put on one of theirs. It’s a very small salon but I felt comfortable with the precautions that were taken.Like in Kerouac’s neighborhood, people around Alésia/Denfert are mostly wearing masks."
"I also wore a mask for my recent haircut, as did the person cutting my hair. Though if you're getting your beard trimmed that wouldn't be possible for that portion of a salon experience. But for the haircut itself (for guys at least) there is no reason not to wear a mask and there is never a reason for the person doing the hair cutting to not wear a mask."
"LynnThat was just the way it was. As my beard gave me a look of a haggard Ernest Hemingway, I felt that work on it was necessary. I went with it and, I suppose, I have been lucky.Keep wellAnthony KPS - I have a set of comfortable, washable, masks, now, and I will abide by all Rules when I visit, as long as no further restrictions are put in place during the next four weeks."
And what if further restrictions are put in place in Paris during the next four weeks? Further restrictions making masks mandatory even in some outdoor areas and streets in Paris are expected to go into effect within the next few days and have already been put into effect in hundreds of locations around France within the last few days.
"I would also think there is every chance of France being taken off the UK no quarantine list soon too unfortunately, Belgium gone today to add to Spain."
New outdoor mask requirements in Paris go into effect on Monday.
"I imagine that eventually from leaving home to returning home people will be expected to mask-up absolutely everywhere, except when consuming food or drink in a Cafe or Restaurant.I can't think of anything more horrific than sitting in a darkened Cinema, watching a showing of ""V for Vendetta,"" and as the movie ends and the lights come up, in the auditorium, you re-discover that you are surrounded by folk in facemasks.Anthony K"
Here is the map and list of areas where masks have to be worn outside from Monday:https:/…20liste1.pdf
The new mask rules do indeed start on Monday -- but the specifics have still not been announced.Who on earth would go to see V for Vendetta?
"Ah, I see that the announcement has been published at last! Thanks, Ally."
Wow that is a very complicated list. To my surprise my own street is not on the list even though it is quite crowded. But the cross street just downstairs IS on the list and also my market street. This implies that it will be safer to just wear a mask outdoors at all times.
"Looks like I will emerge from the Breakfast Room at my Hotel, mask-up and then remove my mask when I am alone later in my Hotel room ... except during Cafe breaks and Lunch.Any attempt to determine which is a mandatory-mask-environment and which is not is beyond me.C'est la vie.Anthony K"
"There should be signs posted in areas requiring them. Probably large ones similar to I or my family have seen rambling around France all summer.I had a magical time at a campground recently where no one was wearing a mask, no one. It was like it was pre COVID-1984. Surreal to witness as I carry my 3 masks in different pockets ready to strap on in a flash.Just be prepared Anthony.."
Sure. My holiday would be severely punctured if I got hit by any sort of fine.CheersAnthony K
"I'm feeling lazy. Has Macron suggested when he might review the current restrictions, and if things improve considerably lift some of them?Keep wellAnthony K"
"If President Macron does anything, it will be to generalise outdoor masks everywhere in France. Public opinion is not against the idea, and everybody wants the contamination numbers to go down."
"Things are currently not improving and I doubt they will improve by September. I also think if the restrictions change it will be toward strengthening them, not lift them.Edited: 2:05 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"""I carry my 3 masks in different pockets"" haha Adventure. Nodding in recognition. I start off all organised ""clean mask in clean bag in front pocket"" ""used mask in plastic bag in handbag"". But wait - oh no did I put a dirty mask in with the clean one? I should probably do the ""hook around wrist"" thing or the ""under the chin"" thing. The latter is hard in the current heat - like wearing a scarf."
"Mary Sawyer, I believe the mode for the trendy is just above a bent elbow crease, sort of like a lightweight miniature strapping pocketbook wallet.It was like from a Stephen King movie, I was scared to even mention about masks in fear of an entire campground going zombie on me. So I kept my distance, washed my hands and enjoyed the moment.Meanwhile.. another country joins the list of giving up on the masks, I can't recall but maybe Denmark or Finland..?I can't really estimate for sure but I think the south of France on the coast is/was more laidback about the masks, maybe the heat?It is 99 degrees in the shade here in France, have a look."
"Apparently, Londoners , forever fashionistas, are bucking the mask trend and the sale of vibrantly patterned silk squares has skyrocketed. https://www.loupiote.com/photos/red-bandana-…Comfort has overtaken any other consideration.Keep wellAnthony K"
"The requirement to wear a mask outdoors in Paris only applies on certain streets, since viruses are contagious only in certain spots. In these spots all must wear a mask, including people on bicycles and in cars. Children under 11 are exempt because they cannot become infected or transmit viruses. The police will impose fines at their discretion because of their expertise in virology, and may allow masks to be lowered by car drivers even on mask streets provided that they are alone and all windows are closed (with or without AC) and the car is not a convertible. People resting in hammocks at Paris Plage may lower the mask while seated but must put it back on while standing. Misters set up due to 100+ heat are to be used only by children because they are immune to disease whereas adults are immune to heatstroke. Masks must be worn indoors, except while eating, because the virus is killed by chewing. Gyms are also exempt because people cannot shed or contract a virus while sweating and exercising, except on a bicycle or scooter. Any mistake brings a €135 fine. None of these rules is a joke. And fans are not recommended in the heat because they might spread a virus with 0.3% mortality, whereas mortality of heatstroke is only 30 times higher with emergency treatment (300 times higher without)."
"It seems like we have a Paris destination expert with a rather exotic interpretation of the rules and the reasons for them, although to my knowledge, he is not actually a medical expert himself and has not been designated as such by Trip Advisor."
k2 - I read post 47 as irony.CheersAnthony K
#47 is pretty funny indeed!
"** Apparently, Londoners , forever fashionistas, ....**Anthony,Some of these photos are hellarious :-)Thanks for sharing."
"** It seems like we have a Paris destination expert ....**K2, it's always great to have an additional luminary on board :-)"
Repetition of irony can lead to it's being believed ... perhaps the author would like to comment.Good morningAnthony K
"Clearly most of you are newbies, because Parismanic does not know how to joke."
"k2 - Accepting your last comment, would lead to suggest that Euromanic should be removed from Destination Expert status.I may never achieve it, but I do my best to be honest and exact, even though I might never win a popularity contest.Keep wellAnthony KPS - Back on topic ... my Polyester scarves have just arrived and maybe later I will post a new avatar with a fashion statement.Edited: 5:42 am, August 11, 2020 "
"Simply a nod to the patterned bandana being worn by many Londoners, as I said elsewhere, also resembling 19th century American Cowboys.Keep wellAnthony K"
"Here in Ontario Canada, a mask is required indoors at all times .. Outdoors no .. Social distancing is helping when masks aren't being worn .. A lot of venues are still not open or allowed (Concerts, museums, Sporting events, etc.) . I think our numbers are pretty low due to these restrictions. But our schools are opening back up in a couple of weeks with safety measures in place but I imagine the numbers will increase then and we may go back into lockdown here in Ontario .. Who knows ... Time will tell for everyone ... Fingers crossed this is cleared up by next summer .. I want to see Paris!!"
"The Préfecture has overruled the mayor and has announced that the mask rules only concern pedestrians and not bikes, scooters, etc."
"Okay, last night I peered out of my window and saw this.https:/…mask-time"
K2: Interesting pictures. The one I'd like the most is the one resembling a white apparition with a pair of sunglasses :-)
"I just peered out of my window and saw three squirrels, a raven and a frog. None of them wearing masks.CheersAnthony K"
@63: All three are flouting the law :-)
"The rules I gave in #47 are real. The reasons I gave for the rules are my own speculation, designed to illustrate the absence of any rational basis for them. In fact, the authorities have not provided any scientific basis for them, nor am I aware of any such basis."
"The rules have changed again. As of Saturday morning at 8 AM, masks will be required in certain zones rather than certain streets. No word yet on what changes are planned for Saturday night or thereafter."
Here is the link for the map and list of areas where the mask must be worn from tomorrow morning:https:/…20OBLIGATOIRE.pdf
"The pdf file has only a list of streets and areas, the map can be found here : https://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gou…"
The first page of the PDF is a map.
"Great. The French government, like most other governments worldwide, is trying to compensate and save face now to cover up their lack of response months ago when the virus first showed up. The useless and archaic rules they have introduced will most certainly be widely ignored and there will definitely be no enforcement. Thank you to all the useless politicians who spent a lot of time coming up with this completely useless map."

"edefranSo do we come to a moment, in this discussion, where we move away from prevention, which is the topic, and debate the cure?It seems to be that a great many people, beach lovers in particular, in the UK certainly, have determined that masks are more of a hindrance than a help. Also if a vaccine is now the only answer to actually stifling the scourge then, surely 2020 is over vacation-wise and 2021 planning is all that we have.CheersAnthony K"

"Anyone fed up with masks, I am in Chartres this evening on the river for a concert at the La Guinguette and although you need a masks to enter it's freedom once seating.It's beautiful here, relaxing, they have the local craft beer on tap. And now a plancha mixte has arrived. The band is about to play. Cheers everyone!https://www.laguinguettedechartres.fr/"
"Everywhere in France, you can remove your mask when you are seated in a cinema, at the theatre, in a restaurant or café, at a sporting event or whatever.Nothing special about being in Chartres."
"Of course, once you remove the mask, any efficacy it might have had is negated, which further illustrates how much mask requirements are based on hysteria rather than science. Covid is much closer to the flu than it is to the Black Death, but the draconian measures being taken against it are more typical of those taken for plague than for the flu.Part of the public clamors for extreme measures because they’ve been frightened into hysteria by the media and governments, and most people do not think for themselves. Certain irresponsible and incompetent scientists who recklessly made dire predictions based only on biased, arbitrary computer models are also partly to blame.In time the severity of the impact of this hysteria on the global economy will become apparent, but it will be (already is) too late."
"Thanks Cosette, we left the concert on the river and now are walking the medieval town light show up to the cathedral. All good, just a couple mask wearers. Almost 99% normal here."
The French government is now contemplating requiring masks indoors even in private offices. The incongruity of requiring masks while mandating that employees return to the office is lost upon them.
"Um, ATF. You do realize you have just thanked a troll, right? It's the same troll who has called me a pedal pusher in profanity laced PM's I've received from them several times. I'm now looking forward to my profanity filled PM from Cosette. How do people on this forum not recognize when they're being trolled?"
"The government is now lamenting the fact that mask compliance is quite low among young people, who seem to believe that the Covid risks are too low to justify the extreme measures. The young people are right, but the government is interested in obedience, not science. Among people in France under age 44, only 105 have died of Covid over the entire course of the epidemic.In other news, the government is cooking up new complex rules for private offices. Masks may be required in conference rooms and open spaces but not individual offices, for examples. No scientific research justifies these distinctions, and rules are apparently being written by people whose scientific background is limited to a screening of Hemo the Magnificent when they were eight years old."
"Update. The outside area around the cathedral was a mask zone with most people obeying and not questioning authority. Thanks FM, someone wished me a nice evening in Chartres and I replied. It's summer holidays..)La Guinguette was packed, I will try for another concert soon. And the light show is/was excellent as always. Beautiful evening in Chartres.Edited: 4:08 am, August 16, 2020 "
