Booked a trip to Quintana Roo in January - what are everyone's thoughts on the Covid-19 risks? Thanks
"Obviously it is a question that would require a crystal ball. My opinion is that I would have no problem traveling in January. I don't think it will be any worse than it is now, and it isn't bad now. Of course it really depends on your health. If you are a high risk individual then it probably wouldn't be a great idea to travel."
"I am traveling to Cancun in Oct. I plan to stay at a resort where they have heightened sanitation practices & screen their employees for C19 symptoms. I plan to wear a mask when not at the resort and use hand sanitizer/Lysol wipes diligently. I think we all need to learn to live knowing C19 is active, there is no guarantee it will ever go away and it isn’t reasonable for most of us to stay home indefinitely."
"I'm going in August - booked a fully refundable trip because the prices were so good. About a month out, we'll sit down and decide if we want to go.It's WAY too early to speculate what will happen in January. Book a refundable trip now and make up your mind in December."
"It is difficult to know what will be happening with Covid in January anywhere. Lots of people are planning to travel before then so you will be able to read reports and information about their experiences. Resorts will be following very strict guidelines to protects guests and staff. It really comes down to each person, where they are from etc."
For sure it’s very safe to travel to Cancun and the Riviera Maya in January. Now all the hotels start open their doors. From day to day we have new openings. All the hotels that already opened follow all sanitary rules and protocols. Everything Is gonna be very good unless the second wave comes but I think it won’t happen.
"""For sure it’s very safe to travel to Cancun and the Riviera Maya in January. ""For sure? Really?Can I ask where you bought the crystal ball sunngod talked about? Because that's the ONLY way to know for sure. It's far too early to know what will be happening in January and everyone needs to make their own decision based on their own situation. Clearly you have a vested interest in people coming here. Your profile says it all. You are a business. You need people to come here. IAnd fyi, ALL the resorts are NOT open.Edited: 11:38 am, June 16, 2020 "
"# 7 is getting very close, but not quite on the line to advertising. I personally think that January will be good, but as everyone else I do not have a crystal ball."
