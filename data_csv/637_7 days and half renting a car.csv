"HI guys this is my first post, I normally use Italian Tripadvisor forum but the Panama forum is a bit death.Me and my wife will be in Panama from the 7th of March to the 22nd of March.Our plan is:8 and 9 in PC10 and 11 in San Blas12 in PCthe 13th we would like to rent a car for 7 days and an half (we would like to come bak to PC the 20th for noon, we have the flight the 22nd)We are thinking to go to Santa Catalina ,because we want to go to Isla Coiba, and maybe to Pedasì or Playa Vineo in order to go Isla Iguana.I read that from Boca Chica you can reach Isla Gamez e Isla Parida but I would rather prefer to not go too far away from PC (I don't want to spent most of my time in car)Is there any other place we could go?As you can understand, we enjoy tropical beaches but we would also like to have a trekking and hopefully see animals and birds.Where would you go in 7 days and an half?Thank you"
"Since you're going to Santa Catalina, you might consider Santa Fé. You'll have to return through Santiago, and Santa Fé is in the mountains just north of Santiago. It's great for trekking, seeing mountains and waterfalls. Contributor SteveB can recommend an excellent guide."
"Thank you GB.I hope I will be able to go, we are having some problems with Covid-19 in Italy"
