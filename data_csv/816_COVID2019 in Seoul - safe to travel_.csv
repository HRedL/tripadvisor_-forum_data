"Hello, me and my boyfriend are supposed to travel to Seoul mid-march. How is the situation there? I've heard of over 400 infected, but we are both pretty healthy and take vitamins every day. We have been saving for this trip for over a year now and we are worried to just not go, since so much money has already gone into it. We will of course have health travel insurance, but I'm asking just how much of a risk is it? We are not planning on any huge tourist activities, more like enjoying the food and shopping, maybe seeing a few Palaces, but that's all."
"Yes.ZERO foreign tourists have been positive during or after staying in Seoul.And you're well-prepared already trying masks on.Edited: 6:44 am, February 22, 2020 "
"Daegu is under quarantine from what I know, the rise had begun there."

South Korea declares Daegu 'special management zone' after COVID-19 death as infections surgequote from https:/â€¦.XlHkfGgzbIU
"News this morning is Korea has raise to highest alert level.I FB messaged my sister who lives in Daegu with her husband. She also works at a private school, so exposed to lots of children. I haven't heard back yet. I need to call them to see what they are experiencing. Unforutnately, my dad has poor health and goes to bed at 8PM and I keep forgetting to call until past his bedtime. My dad moved from Daegu, Camp Henry, to Pyeongtaek, Camp Humphreys last summer."
"Very distressing to see South Korea go RED. I thought this would happen in Singapore, but luckily it didnt. I do hope containment and quarantine has an effect soon."
"I have heard back from family and a few friends. I am happy my son and his girlfriend canceled their April trip. My dad says they expect thousands to be infected within the next couple weeks. My sisters school (she teaches at in Daegu) is closed for two week. Her husband was told not to come to work. So they are already staying in their apartment avoiding unnecessary trips outside. There are a few cases in Pyeongtaek too. Seems like the number is climbing daily.Personally, I would cancel any vacations to SK from to the end of April, possibly May.Also, my dad said they can only buy one mask per day, per person at the shop near him."
Sad to see the current situation in SK. We planned and booked our trip to SK in mid-March too and seems like we have no choice but to cancel everything.
