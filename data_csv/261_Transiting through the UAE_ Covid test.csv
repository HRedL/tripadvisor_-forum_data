"Just a quick heads up from August the 1st transiting through or be it that the UAE is ones final destination, which is basically DXB/Emirates and AUH/Etihad one will need a negative Covid test undertaken a maximuim of 96 hours prior to departure.In the case of Etihad you have to use their testing partner Pure Health which will set one back circa £150, this is all fine and dandy. But they don't have facility as yet in the Philipinnes so travel out of the Ph to AUH could be a bit of an issue.As far as I can make out and I stand to be corrected but Emirates are less pescriptive saying you have to use a UAE accredited lab. https:/…https:/…all-destinations-travel-guidesEdited: 8:13 am, July 28, 2020 "
"Etihad have issued more information re Covid tests, if there is no local Pure Health lab at your point of departure they have issued a list of approved labs, for Philipinnes they are:https://hfsrb.doh.gov.ph/?page_id=1729Edited: 4:14 am, July 30, 2020 "
Thanks for the above information mate. I hope we can get to PH soon.
"Yep.But, I'm sure it will be a bit more challenging post Covid."
"A slight digression if I may.Last year, in February I flew Emirates to Jakarta and back. Later in October I flew Etihad to Manila and back. Both airlines were similar in quality and service. Both flew A380s between London and the UAE. But then they both flew the butter 777 from UAE to the east. Those planes were jam packed and probably heavily oversubscribed by expats returning home. Why don't the airlines fly the A380 (more roomy and comfortable and more passengers) for the South East Asian routes.. ?? I know they do so to Singapore but not for Indo or PH. I did ask a couple of flight attendants this question. They just smiled and said they didn't know."
"@4The reason they fly jam packed planes is because empty seats cost money and in the case of the Philippines the OFW's who in their millions work in the Gulf and make up most of the passengers want cheap tickets not luxury. In any event A380's are becoming uneconomical on many routes and being replaced with Dreamliners, 777's and A350's"

">>> Both flew A380s between London and the UAE. But then they both flew the butter 777 from UAE to the east. Those planes were jam packed and probably heavily oversubscribed by expats returning home. Why don't the airlines fly the A380 (more roomy and comfortable and more passengers) for the South East Asian routes.. <<<======To answer your question in relation to NAIA and Cebu Mactan the airports and are not set up and can't handle A380 and its extremely doubtful they ever will be now.Furthermore, Etihad are taking their A380s out of service from September, this not permanent at the moment but could turn out to be. To emphasise what a dramatic move this is, the oldest aircraft is a mere 4 years old. If they reintroduce A380 back into service the are likely to be reconfigured in a higher density economy pax configuration and will only fly on the heavily trafficked routes. Had the Ph airports been able to accommodate A380 it is reasonably likely they would have been transferred to the AUH > MNL and rtn routing in this config. Its also worthy of note pre Covid the A350's that Etihad had ordered went straight into storage, therefore the writing was on the wall before the storm hit. Etihad have never operated the A380 on the MAN <> AUH route preferring the B.787-10, which in my opinion is a better aeroplane, expect to see this machine on the LHR <> AUH routing shortly. I agree, I find their B.777-300 they use on the AUH <> MNL route bit cramped, dreky and a little tired.Emirates have now started a programme of retiring their A380s with most going straight for salvage as there is no residual market for them, which is the case for most 4 engined machines in the post Covid World.I hope that answers your question.Edited: 12:02 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"Thanks for both the replies. Very insightful and make sense too. But I love the A380. Such a smooth and comfortable aeroplane. If the 747 is the queen of the sky, then the A380 should be the king I think. I hope I can fly in it again sometime.Regards"
">>> A380. Such a smooth and comfortable aeroplane. If the 747 is the queen of the sky, then the A380 should be the king I think. <<<=========Not a patch on Comet or Bristol Britannia which I had the privilege of flying the Atlantic in both, as well as shorter haul routes within Europe too. The Brit was so smooth it was hard to tell when it had taken off, it was not called the 'Whispering Giant' for nothing."
"Getting back on topic, EY have now changed their guidance and those pax *transferring* through AUH do not need a CV19 test carried out by Pure Health, but can use any Government accredited lab:""COVID-19 PCR test if you’re transferring through Abu DhabiYou may arrange a COVID-19 PCR test with any government accredited medical facility a maximum of 96 hours before your arrival time in Abu Dhabi. You must present your result for validation at check-in.If your test is positive, or you are unable to present proof of your negative COVID-19 PCR test, you will not be permitted to travel.""https:/…multi-step-form-wrapperhttps://www.thenational.ae/uae/transport/cor…Edited: 4:08 am, August 05, 2020 "
