"Does anyone know if rapid PCR Covid-19 Testing results valid to clear for airport entry at STT? In California, you can't get an COVID-19 testing appointment if you don't have the symptoms. The testings are limited for people with high risk. The only way we can get results fast is to pay out of pocket for a private rapid PC Covid-19 test."
"Yes. Scroll down to ""Travel Advisory"" first paragraph here:https://usviupdate.com/"
saw it. Thank you so much!
We are leaving on the 16 for STT? Did you find out if Californiaâ€™s need to have the test prior to entry?
Maybe you could call your local DOH in CA for that information.
"We are travelling to STT on 8/26 and are from Oklahoma. Our state is flucuating between 7.5% and 10%. We bought a test from LetsGetChecked.com and are taking the test on the 19th. We should have our results by the 26th. According to the USVI Website, the rapid test is acceptable. The government also notes that if your state is around or above 7.5%, it is recommended to get the test and have the results for your arrival, just in case spikes happen right before or around your arrival. FYI, the test cost about $135, but mine was covered by my health savings account."
Who did you speak with to verify that?
We arrived yesterday (8/9) and our rapid results were accepted. I would recommend filing the results online a couple of days prior to your arrival. We were a party of 6 and the screening process took less than 5 minutes since we pre-filed everything.
"JustineL, not sure what you want to verify but, to repeat from Post #1, all the information you need about traveling here is on this site:https://usviupdate.com/"
"We landed in STT on July 30th. California was at 7.5% positivity rate at that time. For the peace of mind, we did the covid testing 4 days prior departure and got the rapid test results a day before we flew out. The results were presented to the national guards when we exited the airport."
"Having to get the results within 5 days seems like a lot is left to chance on when you take the test and when you actually receive the results.For those folks that have taken either test prior to arrival, can you share the following?1. What was your arrival date?2. What date did you get your results?3. What date did you take the test?4. Who did the test - you (mail in for results), doctor, etc."
where are there rapid result test sites once in St Thomas in order to re-enter your state. Leaving St Thomas tomorrow and my state while I was away put US virgin Islands on the quarantine list. I now need a negative test result in order not to have to quarantine. Any ideas?
"You could check with Community Medical Lab which is behind the hospital in the Paragon Medical Building. They test by appointment 1-4PM, telephone 340-776-7444."
