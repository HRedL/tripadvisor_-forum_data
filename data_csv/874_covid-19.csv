is there any case of Covid-19 in the Yucatan Peninsula? Is there any travel or activity restrictions in place as of April 7th?
"Here's the link to a thread with updates regarding cases in the state of Quintana Roo...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…ADO buses are still running, but not going to Belize, and some municipalities have restrictions. Ferry services have been reduced. Look on the Cancun branch of the forum -- most of the updates seem to be posted there.Edited: 8:33 pm, April 07, 2020 "
"Are you also interested in the state of Yucatan?78 confirmed cases & 4 deaths.Edited: 8:39 pm, April 07, 2020 "
Yes to both of the OP's questions.
Beaches at Playa del Carmen are closed. Beaches are also closed at some other locations but I haven't kept up to date with that -- check the separate forums for each location you're interested in.
Do you know if the buses are still running from the airport in Cancun to Chetumal and if there are restrictions for taking them due to the Covid-19 pandemic? Thanks.
The ADO website shows no buses from Cancun airport to Chetumal for the next 7 days. I didn't check any further than that.
"You can still get an ADO bus from the airport to Playa del Carmen, then change to a bus to Chetumal. Buses are running less frequently now.The airport bus arrives in Playa at the ""Turistica"" terminal on 5th Ave, but the bus to Chetumal leaves from the ""Alterna"" terminal on 20th Ave at Calle 12 (12th Street). The terminals are about 9 blocks apart -- it's walkable but with luggage, get a taxi.Edited: 6:01 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"Re: Post #5I also checked for buses from the airport to Tulum, and none are listed up to the end of next week (I didn't check any further)."
Thanks. Do you tell me the URL for the website so I can check myself?
"ADO website: https://www.ado.com.mx/#/Here's another site in English, but I don't know if the schedules on this site are kept up to date...https://www.clickbus.com.mx/en/Edited: 9:44 am, April 10, 2020 "
Thanks. This is very helpful. I am helping an elderly friend who owns a house in Chetumal and has airplane tickets from Minneapolis to Cancun on May 2. He is not very mobile and I will let him know what is currently going on.
"If your friend isn't very mobile, consider getting the ADO bus from the airport to the ADO bus terminal in Cancun where it's an easier change to a bus to Chetumal.Going via this route means a bit of backtracking, so more time, but you avoid the termnal change & taxi ride at Playa.It depends on his mobility."
"Thanks. I talked with my friend and he told me he takes the Sun Country bus to Playa del Carmen and catches the ADO bus for Chetumal. Someone told him all the roads are now closed because of the Covid-19 quarantine, but looking at the Ado website, it appears that buses are still running. He has tickets for May 2. Do you know the current status of quarantine in Mexico and if the highways are now closed? Thanks again."
"So far, the highways are still open, but some streets in Playa del Carmen have been closed, and more closures are possible. There are more restrictions every few days. It could be complete lockdown by May 2 -- we just don't know.Here's a thread with more information about the latest situation in Playa...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g15081…"
Thank you very much. I will let my friend know.
