Hi has the dreaded Coronavirus affected tourism in the area? Hope to be visiting in May fingers crossed that normal service will be resumed worldwide.
Currently there are just 50 cases of Covid-19 in the whole of the Valencian Community.
"With only 18 in Alicante county, I really wouldn't worry."
"In reply to has it affected tourism, it will have a knock on affect.My neighbour who was to go on a pensioners subsidised holiday at the weekend has had it cancelled and will be refunded what he has paid. These holidays for the pensioners help fill the hotels during the winter months, his holiday was to Ibiza."
"It is affecting tourism massively, which is to be expected. I understand people of certain age or with underlying conditions prefer not to travel."
Yes and badly too all bars and restaurants have been closed. Loud speaker vans around my estate today waning people to stay indoors and avoid all contact that is possible. At the moment It is O.K to go for a walk but physical contact is a no no.
no the cases are in the thousands!
"It sounds ideal,,,it is not ...we have had flights cancelled, transfers to airport cancelled..taxis not always operating. Public transport limitations etc, shopping limitations . Its tough...being only allowed out one at a time.,and being seperated by 2 meters...only food shops open. No other facilities, and police checks everywhere. And no one is allowed on the beaches anywhere. We have loved this area of Altea. But we just want to get home now,,,if only we can get a transfer to the airport, good luck"
At #7 the situation has indeed moved on at great speed from the earlier posts dont think anyone could see just how much change happened so quickly.Hope you find someway to return home.Atb steve.
Though you would need to check it appears alsa are still running a service from altea to alicante (city not the airport)Atb steve
Hate to be the bearer of this news but information at Alicante airport is that there will be no flights out after this evening. Travel companies/airlines are not showing any duty of care to customers and very little information is being given out.
