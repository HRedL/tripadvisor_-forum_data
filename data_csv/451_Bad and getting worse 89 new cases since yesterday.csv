"August 6, 2020 – Aruba has 89 new cases of COVID-19 since yesterday. The number of active positive COVID-19 coronavirus has increased by 89 new cases following additional testing after a significant uptick in local transmission. This increase in cases was announced by Aruba’s Prime Minister.  At time of writing (13:40 AST), the Department of Health is yet to publish the latest statistics."
"I think the Prime Minister asked anyone who was at any of those establishments to come and get tested and they were waiting in line to get tested. so that is why there were so many in one day. It makes sense to me at least. I think this all stems from the bartender or person at the night club and gym. but its scary how quickly it spreads. the CDC issued a warning for US travelers to not travel to Aruba except essential workers, etc. Weird how the tables on that turned. but still Aruba has practically nothing compared to other places. I still would go. I don't go to nightclubs or gyms so as long as the beach is there, I am good."
I just saw this on Aruba Today. I follow it daily. I am devastated. Was really going to keep our trip September 12th but my husband and I are in our 60’s. I don’t think they tested enough in Aruba as it relates to locals! They are being so strict for entry and their locals are spreading it!
I am considering cutting my trip short. What if those who got infected have friends or family members who work in hotels or restaurants?
Carollm - so if the CDC issued a warning we can’t go right or will we need to be quarantined when we return? This is just not worth it anymore for September 12th. Thanks for your help.
"Colette, they didn't say we couldn't go, they just issued a warning. They have issued that same warning for months now but this time they specifically put Aruba. That is the only difference. I don't think they put you have to be quarantined, that is up to your individual state, I believe. Right now, I don't think NJ has Aruba on their list. That warning was in effect last month, too, didn't stop anyone. Truthfully, I feel safer going to Aruba then I would Florida.Edited: 2:35 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"I have to disagree with carollm about the safety of Aruba. So far this month, Aruba's had 142 positive cases (compared to just one positive case from late April to June). On a per capita basis, that's almost identical to what Florida's experienced this month. And Aruba's hospital and medical capacity is significantly smaller than Florida's. By any measure, this is a serious health crisis for Aruba."
"Thank you, Smithlack, but I have to disagree with you about the safety of Aruba compared to Florida. Most of the problem has been at nightclubs and gyms, neither of which I go to when in Aruba. But listen, everyone has to do what they have to do. I feel bad for those going in the next couple of weeks because alot of restaurants are temporary closing so their employees can get tested. I am not scheduled to go until November so I am doing a sit and wait and we rent a house so if all I can do is go to the supermarket, grill at the house and go to the beach with beautiful weather while our weather here in NJ isn't, so be it. But I will wait until mid-October to make my decision, flight is changeable with no penalties and we rent from the same guy every year and he and I spoke."
This is not good news. Every passing day makes it seem less likely that we will go ahead with our late September trip. Very upsetting
"I am here in Aruba now, and people are noticeably wearing more masks out. The locals working at places were always wearing it, but now its everyone for the most part while inside a hotel lobby, restaurant, or shop. We still see people eating indoors without a mask here and there, but that is a minority. Last night at dinner, the host was going to sit us inside and we asked to sit outside.We were supposed to leave this coming Sunday, but I just extended our trip by a week yesterday, since Cali is worse off than here. Going to be extra careful now and only eat outside or in our place. It was nice the first 6 days feeling a bit carefree, but now is the time to dial it back a bit."
"Did anyone really think that this was not going to happen, and it's going to get worse as more and more people come into the country. The only thing that will slow it down is the development of a vaccine or a treatment for those who test positive."
I will definitely cancel but will wait 2 weeks to watch what happens. Was supposed to leave September 12. Between all the stress you need to go through with testing and ED card etc (which I know is necessary) plus 92 cases just today I don’t know how we can feel safe with 12 Only ICU beds in Aruba. And let’s face it those of us who have done the right thing at home the last thing we want ‘is to put ourselves in jeopardy outside of the US. A vacation is supposed to be worry free. This really sucks. Smithlack you are right. I too have been watching since May. They had 0 cases then 1 or 2 and now look! And they are not testing enough like the US.
"Went to the supermarket today (Super food) and security is not letting anyone in without a mask. Two days ago, I'd estimate at most, 50% were wearing masks. Bars at the hotel are still open. The Renaissance is having an all you can eat outdoor bbq this evening."
hemlock...totally agree
"August 6, 2020 – Department of Health numbers show that today Aruba has had an increase of 92 new cases of COVID-19 – active cases now total 146.

The total positive cases to date is 263 (250 residents and 13 visitors – here there was an adjustment from yesterday when the total visitors published was 14). The total recovered is 114 (103 residents and 11 visitors – so 1 resident and 1 visitor have recovered since yesterday). The number of persons tested, including visitors, is now 9260 of which 5754 were persons tested at the airport, an increase of 706 total persons tested since yesterday.
