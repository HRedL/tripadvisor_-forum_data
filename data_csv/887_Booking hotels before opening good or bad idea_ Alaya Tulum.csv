I want to stay at Alaya Tulum in September and book online. The problem is I don't want to use my credit card to book the room only to have them not open and take my money. I tried emailing the hotel and calling them and can't get a hold of anyone. I understand if no one is working there if they are not open yet but it still makes me worried. If they are taking reservations than they are likely opening but it feels strange. Is anyone else having reservations about booking without knowing for sure if the hotel is going to open. Does any one know if the Alaya Tulum is open.
"I wouldn't make any plans until everything is open again.With increasing cases of covid-19, we could go back to a lockdown situation again."
Try booking through a site that offers free cancellation. Most are doing so now. I just booked a hotel through Orbitz yesterday that is scheduled to open next month. I'm scheduled to arrive the day after they open but can cancel up to the day before I arrive.
"Alaya is part of the Ahau Group of hotels, and they're a strong group, financially speaking (as far as I know). I would trust them to honor your booking, even if it means pushing off to a different date in the future. But I would (as always) recommend booking directly with the hotel and e-mailing with someone there to confirm everything. I know the third-party sites offer guarantees, but I still believe it's always best booking direct. I think the Ahau Group has been offering a crazy good deal, buying in advance and getting more than you pay for when you can actually go, worth looking into as I think that's likely only available direct from them."
"We booked through a place called Apple Vacations. They were actually cheaper than going through the hotel resort and making all the other reservations for everything else myself, and we purchased the insurance to cancel up til 24 hrs before the flight for any reason. Weâ€™re just hoping that things settle down and we can go. Good luck on your vacation."
