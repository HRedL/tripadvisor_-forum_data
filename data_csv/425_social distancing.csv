how can you get social distancing around 98% of pool;s in benidorm i could not see that working at the ambassador have you seen it first thing in the morning
A lot of pools will not be in use this year for that very reason. A long list of requirements needs to be adhered to for pools and communal areas to be allowed to open even in hotels. If you are booked into a hotel in the near future you need to check what facilities are open for guests.Steve
"It will stop those who get up early everyday to put their towels in the sunbeds and then don't use the sunbed for hours. Obviously the beds will be placed much wider apart and places will be limited. Hotels may have some sort of a ticket system and time may be limited, this would help give all guests the opportunity of a sunbed. Not a bad thing really as more people will most likely be out and about around the resort. Hotels may not be full anyway so it may all could be fine."
"Those who like sunbathing for hours or all-day, will most probably hire sunbeds on the beach. Could even see hotels like the hotel Mediteraneo and Deloix becoming more popular with sunbathers. Pelicanos and Melia have large outside sun terraces and so does the Terralta. Peoples choice of hotel may well change because of this.Edited: 4:04 am, June 08, 2020 "
"Out of interest, with social distancing the topic of this discussion How do you intend on getting their?Drive?"
Be a long drive to Goa. Looks as if OP has booked a trip to Goa. Guessing it's a flight to Goa.Hotels say they are ready for welcoming guests and have everything in place for social distancing.Perhaps they have put out more table and chairs and removed a lot of the sunbeds.This same social distancing question could be asked about bars and clubs.
germans have towels on hospital beds already
"Post #7, Bad taste that."
To be honest not worth going on holiday until there are no rules however long that may be.No point spending a lot of money and worrying about going in the pool etc. When we go we go just like old times not before.
"Zero social distancing in China, but they all wear masks.Same on a plane.No rules? I can't wait that long simon, I'll make the best of whatever I'm allowed to do."
"Hopefully there will be a vaccine before we go next June and this won't be a problem. We are also due to go in December , pool won't be a problem but lounges and restaurants will."
tintooo have you ever seen wot germans do with there towels JOKE
Yes I have. Joking about them putting them on hospital beds when people are dying of Covid19 is just not funny.
"tintooo punch line TOWELS not dying,not hospital. I DO NOT WANT ANYBODY TO PASS A WAY"
"I am booked in the Playmon with the kids, I too am curious if the pool will be open for the kids. Mid August I am due to go, I cant see it. Fair few beach days I think."
"Children are thought not to catch or pass on to any great extent. Plus education is a necessary part of life.I thought the class numbers were around 15, hence why many are doing part time or still no time.Teachers can wear masks if they wish, the teachers are kept to the same pupils if possible,and always social distance from other teachers.There is no magic potion, possibly never will be, which is why we have to try to make the best of things."
"From NHS website: “Children can get coronavirus (COVID-19), but they seem to get it less often than adults and it's usually less serious.” Face masks in classroom, transport or general life settings are more to do with not spreading the virus than not catching it. Our aerosol eruptions come from our mouths and noses and masks mitigate that by reducing droplet travel.Edited: 4:58 am, June 09, 2020 "
"50 children per class, thats a heck of a lot of younsters crowded into one room. Where is that, how many teachers per class? Thought there were supposed to be a limited number on return to school. Is a teacher allowed to wear a cloth mask if they feel threatened by the virus. Would suppose if they feel more secure it could be an option for them. Schools have been open right the way through this pandemic. I know a few teachers who have enjoyed the experience of teaching children of front line workers and others. Asked if they wore masks or felt in any danger, answer was no. Schools in Wales are due back quite soon, limited class sizes. So the children will have to take it in turns to attend. Think it was on the news this morning children in England won't be going back soon."
"50 Mally not 15, I work closely with China on a daily basis."
"Many countries now have a 1m distancing rule, few have a 2m rule like the UK and Spain and in fact, WHO advises that 1m is safe. So things will change, probably witin a month. So 1m. That's not really different to normal is it when sunbathing next to a stranger? Also, from my experience, Benidorm tourists seem, to put it kindly ""go for it"" more than other places I holiday in. I reckon they might be just a little mroe sensible than normal but am sure people and families will have just a good a time as they always do.Edited: 7:01 am, June 09, 2020 "
Jeny5 children in England went back to school part time on the 1st of June.
Apologies Jeny5 just seen the news and you are correct.
"Bobby C, whilst being very clear that I am of the opinion that our government has created a hodge podge of schemes, it isn’t really possible to isolate one rule (e.g. the 2m rule) without our seeing it in the context of the complete set, as they all interact to form a risk factor. Some countries, for instance, have a far superior track and trace setup which allows flexibility elsewhere in their approach."
Ah 50 o a class in China! I see.No concern of mine whatsoever.
I am sure you are not alone in your thinking Mally.
I like how so many blame the Government for everything as we have so many experts why were these experts not offering advise from day one instead of bleating about when they can have their next holiday.
"I’m not expert but pay attention to those that are, only refer to qualified sources (I may badly express the point of their findings though) and have never once grumbled about not having a holiday either. Our government has been poor with the exception of furlough and business support. That all seems fair enough to me. Take me task for off the point, poor humour: guilty."
"Sermac, should we have used this forum to give our advice to the British public ? Is that what your saying ? We took advice from the government and look how that’s worked out, highest death rate per capita in the world, yes, in the world. So being arsey on a travel forum because some posters have an opinion seems unfair on your part to me."
"The Spanish government have now agreed to what will be in the new decree once we enter the New Norm and leave lockdown on 21st June. One of the main points is that 6yrs and above will need to carry on wearing face masks indefinitely where 1.5m distance can't be guaranteed. So anyone coming on holiday will have to bring masks with them as you will need them from landing at the airport and for your onward journey to Benidorm.I do wonder how strict the police will be with tourists, and handing out fines for not wearing face masks only time will tell, it could be a good money earner for the pot."
"Hi sunlover, any indication how long the face mask regulations are liable to be in force, or is it open ended at the moment. Due to come on 7th July, still undecided whether to stick or twist. PJ"
"Thank you for your replies and to add we are all experts after the fact and if you check the UK has a long way to go to get to the 80,000 that died in the UK in 1968/69. This was Hong Kong flu which we all worked through. The problem now is the Government took the advise of experts 100 of them so please don't blame all this on the Government as in my opinion it has been the blind leading the blind. Enjoy your holidays if you are prepared to travel."
"Four things strike me about that statement Selmac. Firstly we are at around 65000 excess death now do not that far off really. Secondly, that is despite all the measures put in place (which could have been better). Thirdly, experts offer advice but our executive (it is their elected role) is and has been cherry picking it for motives that are probably political and self-centred. Fourthly, your thesis really concludes that everyone is just whinging, that nobody knows anything and that the best approach is to do nothing. So, I’ll congratulate our government where it’s due and heavily criticise its leadership in most aspects, especially around all those unnecessary deaths in care homes and amongst our carers. The job our executive have is to understand the competing voices of advice and relative perspectives, filter that and rationalise a justifiable (and evidenced) response - not just keep claiming that “we are following the science” which is tantamount to saying “we aren’t really doing our job.” It is notable that our government does not publish its evidence or decision making - despite being repeatedly asked for it."

No plans for holidays. All the best Sermac.
If I can put you right on care homes they are Privately owned not by the Government my Father was in a care home and we were paying mega bucks for him in there. So why did the owners of these homes look after all who they were getting mega bucks to care for that's why they are called Care homes. Enjoy your holiday maybe it will be Coronavirus free.
"Me and the Mrs could go abroad, on return I would have to quarantine for 14 days but my Mrs could go straight back to work as a midwife. Now where is the sense in that. Also if her antibody test comes back positive,she can still work. Lol world is a mad place."
"Sermac, your father was obviously a self funder in his Care Home and therefore the contract was between him and the care home provider. You can guarantee self funders pay considerably more than the majority of the residents who are funded by the Local Authority. Whilst the Homes are private, they are contracted providers to the Council LA and the contract is between them. Of course the Homes should provide excellent care to all but for the purposes of PPE, the homes should have enjoyed the same provision as the hospitals. It was an additional expense way beyond the fee the homes normally receive (and why some are now nearing bankruptcy). Jules"
"Thanks for the info sunlover, have bought 50 masks, will have a practise first.Then order some more if I think I can put up with them.on holiday. What do you reckon I need? 5 a day like veg."

No further discussion with you sermac. You are rude and utterly clueless on this subject I’m afraid! Jules
sermac42 my wife and i congratulate you on that statement 100%
https://www.thelocal.es/
"From that Dawn, it looks like face masks will be a feature in Spain for a very long time! From the article;‘Wearing face masks will be compulsory in Spain until the coronavirus epidemic is defeated once and for all, Health Minister Salvador Illa said on Tuesday.Illa said the measure would remain in force after the state of emergency ends on June 21st and will ""remain in place until we permanently defeat the virus, which is when we have an effective treatment or vaccine against it"".Jules"
"Everyone will have different opinions Jules but if I had to wear a face mask all day it wouldn’t feel like a holiday.It would actually stop me from returning to Benidorm until that changes.I work for a pharmaceutical company and all the big companies like GSK, Bayer and Genzyme to name a few are all working hard to manufacture a vaccine.Nobody knows how long that will be."
"Presently, face masks are compulsory in public areas where social distancing cannot be maintained and on public transport. You don't physically have to wear it all the time, but obviously have to have it with you."
Jules how many of your family have been in a care home if it's none please don't tell me I am clueless on the subject.
"#48 ,you will know more than most that a vaccine historically takes in the region of 15 yrs ,we still dont have one for HIV or SARS why would anyone suggest this will be any quicker,yes agree all the big boys are working on this, well they need to as they have been handed $8billion in donations since the global telethon of May 4th."
"Already in production (with caveats):https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/astra…I listened to a senior guy from AstraZeneca over the weekend and if (there’s the word) trials in Brazil (current epicentre) go well (enough?) they would be able to roll it out in the autumn. But (another of those words), whilst already in large scale production, he was keen to say that they may have to bin the lot - so it is still something of a gamble. We’ll see. Incidentally HIV is quite different from this virus in that HIV’s actuation and effect is extremely different from person to person. CV is relatively stable. This is fortunate for attempts to immunise us against CV."
"Social distancing,vaccine,14 day quarantine, whatever.All countries need to do is stop people arriving from countries that have high infections.We have at the minute,that's why Spain don't want us,Brazil have also.In a month or so ours may have changed,so we may get invited back and if Spain continued to have low rates the quarantine may be lifted.But Russia have said they will begin flights on 15th july,lots of them go to Benidorm,that's worrying."

"All pretty irrelevant, I don't think the Spanish are ready to welcome the Brits for quite a while yet, and looking at the irresponsible demos happening on a regular basis, can't say I blame them. If a second spike occurs, blame that lot."

social distancing pool it would have to be melia or pelicanos at this moment in time for us
"Theres a blo-dy great pool down the front that would have no problem with social distancing, how anybody could prefer a concrete hole in the ground, swimming in recycled urine beats me."

"The media is only giving one negative narrative, it has to at the moment, so your avergae person is fixated on death figures and the image of a Covid-19 patient struggling to stay alive in ICU on a ventilator. I work in hospital with these patinets and the truth is for every person like that, there are 1000's more that ahv ebeen ""fighting"" the virus by chatting away to another Covid-19 patient in the next bed to them and soon to be sent home. Not one bed set aside as extra space was ever used, the peak didn't arrive and I don't expcet the second wave will either.I don't think it is anybody's fault but I do think time will prove that a gross and unnecessary overeaction to the threat of a regular (and overdue) virus has been made by governments worldwide. The good news is that I think things will start moving fast and Benidorm holidays by Autumn will be pretty much as normal.Edited: 6:38 am, June 11, 2020 "
"To be honest Bobby, I don’t think anyone has denied that for the majority of people affected by Covid, the outcome is good. Trouble is, it’s game of Russian Roulette and even younger people have died. My friend’s son had one hell of a time at 22. This isn’t a seasonal bug with over 64,000 excess death over national averages.I’m not sure which hospital you work in but my closest relative is a Covid nurse and she’s had it badly herself as a relatively younger person. Her experience of nursing people with this virus is harrowing.Let’s be sensible but not complacent because even Spain registered a massive increase in positive numbers this Tuesday.Jules"
Yes a game of Russian roulette and if you are really unlucky you get to play the 50/50 survival chance but mess you up whatever version with the ventilator. #67 Summer weather possibly?
"Jules, absolutely, some fit & healthy people have tragically died, but they do every day, one way or another. The % is the important thing and when the dust has setlled I think we'll find 99.9%+ of us were unaffected and therefore the measures taken were disproportionte and may well cause more deaths than the virus.We'll never know the true death toll as most are ""last of days"" patients and any % increase on the 2020 death figures could well be attributed to people who, during this crisis, didn't get the medical help they needed or didn't try to get it, proven by the A&E figures.I think we'll go back to normal quickly through public pressure. I was scared during the run up to the peak, I am around virus paitents every day and I am 59, I thought I'd be certain to get it, all my colleauges felt the same. But I didn't, none of us did, the beds were not used, ICU never got busier than normal, we've seen this virus first hand and now the mood has changed and opinions are starting to change too.Edited: 8:01 am, June 11, 2020 "

"Excellent first hand info from Bobby C ,unfortunately it will never suppress the fears of some and understandably.I to was scared at the onset,working closely with China and seeing things unfold there before many did here,however, as I have mentioned before, too many lies, contradictions and inconsistencies surround this mystery virus.Bobby you might find the paper written and published by the John Hopkins university Sept 19 titled preparedness for a high impact respiratory pathogen pandemic of interest,if you havnt already read."
"JamieandSuzanne, I'll have a look at that read, thank you.Jules, I broadly agree, governments planned for the worst case scenario, this was either the right thing to do, or more likely, the weakest. But going back to the thread title, we are going to have to get the economy going PDQ but to do so with social distancing, as it is now, walking arrows, queuing, screens, queuing, 2m apart, queuing, limited seats everywhere, queuing is never ever going to work, especially in Benidorm. It's no good the government saying get out and spend whilst simultaneously making it as difficult as possible to do so!The truth needs to slowly come out regarding the real risk to ally peoples fears after being assailed with only negative news for months, before we well and truly paint ourselves into a corner."
"The sooner we ask questions the quicker we get back to normal not that wacko speak ""new normal"":-) Back to Benidorm and enjoying ourselves like regular human beings. I am not worried about virus complacency because as a fit & healthy 59 year old having seen many virus patients I've realised that beer poses more of a threat to my life than Covid-19 does!The lockdown was introduced for one reason, to protect the NHS, or flatten the curve as they called it. Well even when cases were rocketing, the NHS easily coped. Now hospitals including mine are half empty whilst patients die through cancelled operations and treatment. So what is the reason for the lockdown now? There doesn't appear to be one.Edited: 10:05 am, June 11, 2020 "
Social distance plotting on Lavante beach:https:/…plotting-in-benidormSteve
"Hundreds of football fans gathering outside the stadium at last nights seville derby game, ignoring social distancing, and they were not Brits."
"Hi Tebo,Thanks for the heads up. Maybe more people will take their own equipment to the beach ( the Spanish usually do anyway) and use the green and blue zones. I personally wouldn't want to be using any rental equipment at this stage. Wondered too if Covid-19 survives on sand/how long for? Freshwater /sea another concern for me, different theories about! Going to be awkward for them cleaning the beachs with all the pegged out plots in place.Margaurite"
"With 0.06% of the UK population thought to have the virus right now, and 99.9% of them will be just fine, you really have to think about how are you going to actually catch covid-19 to get some perspective on your saftey. First you'd have to meet 1 of the 0.06% of 67 million people. You'd have to right up close to them for a decent period of time so that you absorbed enough droplets to contract the virus. Having managed to actually get it, then you'd only have a 99.9+% chance of being absolutely fine:-)Pesonally, I go to bed dreaming about a holiday in Benidorm this year, I don't nod off worrying about being struck by lightning. The media has a lot to answer for and todays horrific economic news will see opinions change, along with the horror stories about cancelled treatments and missed cancer scans and biopsies thse and other factors will now see a mood swing and government social distancing rules quickly change. It's now a farce, it's just about over...... 0.06%.......Edited: 7:02 am, June 12, 2020 "
Spot on Bobby.
"However, statistics can be creative to press both sides of the argument Bobby and in truth, I’ve never seen any as rosy and unthreatening as the ones you’ve posted. I think we have to be aware that the NHS wasn’t overwhelmed because a high proportion of the over 70/75’s took social isolation very seriously and the 2.8 million clinically vulnerable who eventually found themselves on the shielding list had little choice. 90,000 were children and teenagers. The risks to those people was such that even if 10% of them had disregarded advice, the NHS most certainly would have crashed!So great for those who feel confident enough to use those stats to assess their risk level but for some of us, the only statistic that matters is our individual chance of surviving Covid. Sadly for some, me included, I can’t really be so cavalier about it and the figures are still too high in reality to ignore. Plus infection isn’t only contracted through direct droplet transmission. Infected people touch things especially on planes.Good luck to those who make it on holiday and manage to have a good time however. Jules"
"I always find the narrative of ‘the media have a lot to answer for interesting’ and sometimes they do (racism, homophobia, sexual objectification) but on other occasions (this being one) the focus should be most heavily on the government - they are who the Brutish people voted-in to take charge and lead us through the mess that we have. I’m not claiming the perfection of the media but I am suggesting that our attention should be firmly on the ‘leaders’ of our country. Of course, many of the fears are not directly about catching the virus but about being part of contagious chain that leads to further unnecessary deaths. The whole population chances for an individual catching and being maybe low but the potential magnifying effect across the whole population is at a risk level that could bring about high levels of death again. There was a spike that came close to overburdening hospitals (but mostly didn’t) - my daughter trains and supports medical staff with ventilators and the associated equipment and works across the UK - she saw quite large differences between hospitals. What is reported at some hospitals is not the situation for all but which CV was to hit (or not) was hard to second guess. The ongoing impact of missed treatment, the economic impact and the wave of health issues that will emerge are going to present huge problems but it is the government’s role to navigate that whilst not providing the opportunity for further for CV to get a foothold again - either now or in the near future as we potentially move into the next CV season. Government need to lead us through all that and we and the media need to hold them to account. We should remember who was late to lockdown, who released untested elderly in to care homes, didn’t establish track and trace early enough, didn’t close borders, lied about death rates, lied about testing rates, didn’t take the experiences of other nations into account properly, oversaw 65000 (ish) excess deaths, didn’t protect our carers property, don’t release evidence for their decisions - they’re the ones that spring to mind. None of that is the media by the way (PS. I don’t work for the media and find much problematic about it)."
"Lot of hindsighters on this thread and others, regards issues like lockdown, no great calls on here for lockdowns in the uk when people were still travelling to spain early march when spain was not on lockdown ( except madrid / barcelona).There is no govt out there that has not been criticised for not doing introducing measures early enough, though few actually said so at the time.Atb steve"
"bobby c @87,Months down the line pretty much clued up about Covid-19 in general. ""in as much as I will ever be"" Certainly don't go to bed worrying about.. Just wondered about the survival etc of Covid-19 on sand, in the sea and swimming pools....The Media! Don't get me started on that one!....Margaurite"
"Hindsight, yes, I feel totally different to how I did a month ago, and a month before that, the evidence now though is certainly pointing towards we might be experiencing a regular (nasty) seasonal virus. And that the measures taken to combat it, will prove disastrous and diproportionate. It's best to discuss it as we continue to shield old people, from something they are very likely to never get whilst we condemn others to die .The NHS. My hospital never came close to being overwhelmed and spare capacity that was provided in anticipation of the peak resulted, via panic and hysteria, in older patients and arrivals being sent back into care homes and we now know the outcome there. Not one bed of that spore capacity was ever used because as we know now, the peak has passed before lockdown was introduced.I am optimistic, as ever, that things will quickly turn positive regarding social distancing and holidays:-)"
"BeniSteve, holding the government accountable and claiming knowledge are not the same thing and as such there is no hindsight in my statement. However, locking down a week earlier was on the table back then and discussed but then the herd immunity argument held sway. So, no hindsight from me just a set of items that appear to have questionable decision making behind them."
"Should have read,"" Certainly don't go to bed worrying about but can understand those that would!Margaurite"
"I agree Margaurite, I can totally understand why others still think differently. 2 months ago I probably thought the same but first hand experience has slowly changed my mind. People are starting to ask questions you never heard a month ago as it becomes clear that things are not stacking up, the goverments bizarre handling of it is also a huge problem, how can they untangle themselves?Edited: 9:33 am, June 12, 2020 "
"Hello buyurun, to be fair in the day and weeks leading up to both the spanish lockdown and a week later the uk's there was little discussion about such things happening or needing to happen on here, dissusions involved best places to watch the cheltehnam festival and best places to celebrate someone elses patron saint day.Zero talk about lockdowns from anyone.As said there is barely a govt out there that is not facing a barrage of criticism and calls for accountability, certainly in the uk and spain, but from politicians and media down there was no great call at the time across wider media in the preceding weeks from all those who know a lot now.Atb steveEdited: 9:44 am, June 12, 2020 "
"Media have most of the nation as a captive audience and are loving having the high viewing figures. They do a good job of feeding us with whatever they want. It came to the point that some viewers had to switch off the news channels, because they were saturating minds with constant horrific new by the minute. Too many deaths for many minds to handle. It has been a nightmare time for thousands having to deal with this pandemic and our hearts go out to all those affected. Very sad times indeed. Been trying to watch a few new updates via various news channels looking for some good news. Now they seem to be stirring up more trouble within the our communities when most people are already feeling very depressed and terrified. The country is starting to win this fight against the virus, the infection rate is dropping now everyday. Not that many covid patients in the hospitals now. We should be hearing positive news stories of hope. Seems some in the media would prefer this nation to sink rather than swim. Keep us watching, keep stirring, keep us captivated, keep feeding the nation the bad news. Many on here will not agree, I respect we all have different views."
"I’m not that pessimistic about the phased unlocking although it’s clear the shielders (who are most certainly not all old people) will be reliant on a compliant and caring community response. It’s the ‘I’m alright Jack’ attitude that will scupper this. Arguably the hospitals, especially ICU’s were not overwhelmed because of (Over) cautious planning, compliance with lockdown and the fact that the death rate and therefore turnover was 800 @ day at one point. We need to remember there are still hot spots too but thankfully massive improvements. What I do agree with is restarting other medical services now. I’ve personally been affected by cancelled treatment and Covid protected areas must now be a priority even if it means mobile units or sub contracting it to private hospitals (who have offered).Jules"
"Ditto jeny, the media had brexit to batter everyone 24/7 for months then covid whilst everyone could do nothing but sit home and watch, whilst they gadded about cities looking for the one packed tube or bus on that day just to sow discord.All while asking daft questions at briefings, like when are the schools closing and practically next day when are the schools re-opening.Atb steve"
"#97, Benisteve. No conversations about an earlier UK lockdown may have occurred on the Tripadvisor Benidorm forum but believe me they were occurring around me and my family and friends. Lots of people I know were frustrated with the lack of action being taken by our government in March."
"Hello darren,indeed i daresay but not on here, a travel forum or a million and one reasons not to travel forum as it is now.Maybe those that earnestly discussed lockdowns should have contacted their MP's at the time, and those that want to hold them to account do the same now, as boris and the crew are infrequent visitors to the benidorm forum.Soon this may become a travel forum again.Atb steve"
Filming on building sites from above in case they found two builders working on a site who were not quite two metres apart. Hiding in hedges trying to catch people out. It came an obsession with some news channels. The nation locked down and the large majority of us understood fully what we had to do to keeps safe. Wonder how those in the media got to work. Bet they had a driver in a posh car who was not sitting exactly 2 metres away. Now all they seem to talk about is when the next protest is.
"bobby c #96People, for E.g. were asking questions about why the care homes were left unprotected early days and still shocked about now! Should have been high on the list of priorities...The government's, (I know had problems all over the world) ""how can they untangle themselves"" Hopefully learn by their mistakes and some....Margaurite"
"Indeed jeny, filmcrews travelling to beaches, finding the most packed section to film and then criticising people for travelling a 100 miles whilst doing exactly the same themselves with a dozen others in the van.All it did was provoke the other 60 odd million who were doing what they should do into thinking its everyone else.Atb steve"
"Hi BeniSteve, I was not referring to it being discussed on TA nor that folk in general were discussing lockdown but lockdown was being discussed as an option in government and government related bodies from January - it may have been an observational discussion to start with but it was under discussion and that at that stage was how it should have been. That’s is not hindsight that is what COBR has acknowledged - why wouldn’t they be: the WHO was discussing it, as were other countries because it was one of the options. The speed of reaction was the problem and that needs accounting for."
"#89 Hi Jules, there is plenty of evidence out there that can support Bobby C account ,many senior virologist, scientist ect do not agree with the measures that have been taken or indeed the seriousness of this illness.To quote Dr Joel Kettner,professor of community health science and surgery of Manitoba university,former Publice Health officer for Manitoba province and medical director of the International centre for infectious diseases.""I have never seen anything like this,anything near like this.I am not talking about the pandemic,because I have seen 30 of them ,one every year, it is called influenza and other respitory illness viruses we don't always know what they are but I have never seen this reaction and I am trying to understand why"""
"Hello buyurun, to be honest i have not said you had mentioned it on here before but it would give some gravity to the things that you outline now (in hindsight) would it not, as said if like many you want to hold those in charge to account maybe contact your MP , none of them take much interest i imagine in a travel forum.Its time to move on in my opinion with a careful but optimistic outlook about how we exit but control this virus, talking about what should or shouldn't have happened is fairly pointless as we move forward.The past should not be one of the million and one reasons give by some on here as reason not to move forward including travel, it is a travel forum remember.Atb steveEdited: 11:03 am, June 12, 2020 "
"That is the nature of science and research, in that it allows for a wide set of evidence and views from often quite narrow research perspectives - all of the potentially accurate from their specialist knowledge’s perspective. There will always be outliers but a government’s job is to evaluate and weigh these views against the complex needs of the societies and people it represents."
"Incidentally BeniSteve, I do like to visit Birmingham. I’ve had some good times there in some very good pubs."
"For every viewpoint like that J&S, it wouldn’t be difficult to produce another dozen eminent scientists and virologists proclaiming that this is the greatest health threat we’ve ever seen! I do despair however of those who continue to compare Covid to flu. Physiologically, it has a savagery and transmissibility potential unlike any seasonal flu and is leaving some victims with organ damage way beyond other viruses we have seen. In hindsight it may be found that the response was disproportionate, clumsy, too slow, too fast etc. etc. but I’m making my own decisions on this one because I know clinically, the outcome for me and my family wouldn’t be good. It’s the statistical evidence Bobby quoted that i find incongruous with the published mortality rates. However, stats can be manipulated depending on how they’re interpreted. We all need to assess our own risks and make decisions based on them particularly as it relates to holidays. Regards,Jules"
"Hello buyurun,your welcome in brum anytime, just bring your hand sanitiser, mask and gloves☺.Atb steve"
"What a shame that you can’t post a photo. I’ve not had a haircut of any kind for 16 weeks. I’ll be forming a cult behind my shed - where my wife can’t see me.Edited: 12:12 pm, June 12, 2020 "
It would break the internet mate.
"To clarify again, they are not my stats, it's in todays mainstream news, the BBC, The Times, Daily Mail etc The infection % is thought to be 0.06% so, basically, it's over, following a bell curve similar to all viruses. All countries infected before us or around the same time are showing the same rapidly downward curve. What is interesting today is that at the same time they are saying the ""R"" number is rising, well that doesn't work out at all! I wish they'd just do like Germany, easy to understand stats, death/infections per 1000. The death figure for people with no underlying condition is also published daily by the NHS, it's not 30/40/50000 but in fact around 1350 that died of Covid-19 alone. Many more than that figure will die from lack of hospital treatment during lockdown. I read that 16 children died of flu in 2017/18 in the UK, that shocked me, I would never have guessed at such a high number. In 2020 2 youths under 19 have died of Covid-19. Schooling went on as normal in 2017/18.The tide is turning, I think social distancing will be over before Autumn officially or not."
"Jules said this:-""We all need to assess our own risks and make decisions based on them""That was all that was ever needed, as soon as we started to be more sensible and take more care of hygiene the rate of infections fell sharply, Look after the elderly and ill, pay care workers quadruple pay to live in homes, no visitors to those homes or hospitals, stay in if you feel poorly and wash, wash, wash your hands. Everybody else could have carried on as normal and I don't think things would have turned out any differently. Opinions eh?Edited: 1:35 pm, June 12, 2020 "
We were told to not wear our uniforms to and from work early on in the lockdown at our trust.Dawn x
"Hi Dawn ,yes I understand that to be the case, however, I was talking historically."
"AS DC67 said, it's always been ""good practice"" not to wear your uniform out of work, for a few reasons not just now. But right now I've been told I can't wear it outside. I don't think (not certain) that scientists have actually manged to cutlivate, in labs, the virus taken from all sorts of surfaces, so there is not much to worry about regarding touching surfaces.Anyway to cheer you up, or make you run screaming, here is the new Greene KIng social distancing boozing!https://gk.qumucloud.com/view/SO2kUcuYbFX#/Edited: 2:40 pm, June 12, 2020 "
