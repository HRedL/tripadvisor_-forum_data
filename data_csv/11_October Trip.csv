"Hi there, we have a 4 day trip to Bellagio booked for late October. Will all of the shops, restaurants, boats etc still be open? and is the weather the same as the UK this time of year, or milder? Thanks in advance."
Questions to ask yourselves are: (1) Will there be adequate health and medical and hospital services to help you should you need assistance of this type? (2) Will restrictions affecting foreigners impact on your vacation? (3) Will you be last in line for receiving health and medical and hospital services? (4) Will you get a place in line? (5) How will culinary guidelines might impact on your choice of food you consume and purchase? (6) Do you have to observe certain regulations for movement and attendance at events? (7) How will the rules of the travel games be changing dramatically to begin to affect your vacation beyond preliminary planning? (7) Ask about consumer protections services. (8) Ask about curfews and unintended delays in getting things done. (9) Anything like common courtesy for getting refunds? (10) Cancelation policy? (11) Ask about hours of operation for places you might want to visit often. (12) Will National embassy offices restrict you having access to their offices and services? (13) Consider the entire realm of behavior tolerated. !14) Ask about if practices for tourism will affect your personal style for traveling. (15) Do's and don't's might add up to more than wearing matching colors for clothing on Tuesdays. Read about rules.
"I think the OP was asking a general question about Bellagio in October, as in are places still open at that time of year under normal circumstances. Obviously though this is not a normal year so it may be that less places are open than is usual for that time of year. I have a booking for September so will be keeping an eye on this forum for news of the situation over there. Sorry I can't answer your question but I'm sure someone will be able to."
"Yes, my questions were related to the typical goings on in Bellagio at that time of year, rather than covid-19 related. I'm fully aware what implications that covid-19 'might' have right now, but i didn't ask that."
