Hi. I think this year IPL will be conducted in empty stadiums because of COVID-19 threat. Better to wait a little before getting excited for your trip.
"The thing that may hamper you - other than COVID impact - is Dubai is quite sporadically developed, and depending on where the fixtures are played you could lose money and time transporting about.As @turntable suggests, they could also be in empty stadiums so it's wise to see what will actually be allowed, especially for travel too.Still, it gives you plenty of time to get used to Dubai by researching the Top Questions (on the right) and back in the forums for Q4.Q3 - see the threads on testing.Q2 - see Q3 answer above.Q1 - it depends on which location. If the matches are in Sports City, that's quite some way from the main areas of Dubai (e.g. Old Dubai, Marina etc.) You can get cheap accommodation around there, especially in hotel apartments or short stay apartments that will be less than being in touristy areas, as there aren't as many hotels."
You and @turntable are right. Let's wait for another month. Thank You
