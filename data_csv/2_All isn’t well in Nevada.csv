"At least 123 visitors to Nevada tested positive for the coronavirus while visiting the state in recent weeks or shortly after returning home, according to state health data.The cases jumped in the weeks after Nevada’s casinos reopened on June 4 after being shuttered for nearly three months. Gov. Steve Sisolak said the state was ready to welcome people from across the country, saying “We’re encouraging visitors to come and enjoy themselves and have a good time.”Last week, Sisolak re-imposed restrictions on bars and restaurants to address a spike in cases, including closing bars in counties deemed hotspots. When asked if he’d close casinos again, the governor said he would wait for additional information before deciding whether to implement new restrictions on them"
Unfortunately my Oct trip to Vegas is becoming less likely.
I don’t think any state knows what to do with this virus. I
I am honestly curious as to what they thought would happen after reopening with so few restrictions and little in place to enforce restrictions they did have? People get drunk and stupid. People go to Vegas for the lack of rules.
Wear a damn mask...so simple
"They are trying to balance healthcare and the economy. Both are extremely important. The economy is not just about $. See what happens to society in a depression. Very scary!What to do? Provide guidance about distancing, hand washing, masks, don’t touch face, etc. if hospitals are in good shape, go out following guidance please. Obviously, you can’t police everyone and cases will rise. Once hospitals get stressed, shut down again. Hospital occupancy improves, now go back out. Rinse, repeat until there’s a vaccine. Most (some crazies still in doubt) know the risk. So, how important is a haircut, a dinner out, a trip to Vegas? Stop blaming your government and start taking responsibility for your own actions!"
"The governor is basing decisions at least in part on imperfect contact tracing, both in Nevada and Elsewhere... The current surge is both US wide... and to some extend based on bars opening (not casinos) and for July 4 parties and events... Nevada casinos have well thought out plans in place to distance guests, to check guests, and to disinfect... Bars are now closed but they will serve you a drink at a table or a gaming machine while you socially distance. A few weeks from now we will be over the July 4th hump and bars will not be contributing new cases... then we will have a better idea of how safe, safe is... The Casinos are big business and thoughtful businesses... they know they have to make it safe for customers to return..."

Science is like a maze, should we go this way or that way, Nothing in this post is Democratic or Republican. I watched a Las Vegas Vlog today and someone put a post in what was very interesting. Here it is......There was a guy in California he got in line with his wife & 2 children in car to get tested. They filled out paperwork at first stop , then moved up in line with their car . They waited 3 hours and were not near testing part - so they got out of the line and went home. 3 weeks later - test results come in their mail. 3 were positive 1 negative. They NEVER had the testing done ! WHAT is going on ???!!!"

"Stop trying to use facts to convince Trump supporters. If facts could convince them, they wouldn't be Trump supporters."
Good points Steve. The young people are infecting each other. They do not get sick.
"Taking a break from debating with the suddenly statistics obsessed wackadoodles who are simply using the massive surge in new cases to claim that Covid is no longer deadly. The fact that they aren't dying yet does indeed lower the case fatality rate. Tragically in a few weeks deaths, being a lagging indicator, will begin to surge too, ruining their idiotic house of cards. In 2 weeks time it is now a certainty deaths will average 2000+ a day.I'm sure they'll have a new argument ready to go of course."
"Well Belgium, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden and France are doing worse per million than we are."
"The mistakes made by many countries early on, Spain and Italy in particular, but parts of the US too, were very bad. No question. But the more important point is that the countries you listed learned from their mistakes and have contained it, while here in the US things are worse than ever and deteriorating by the day. So arguing CFR or deaths per million is kind of dumb considering we are nowhere close to containing it.Let's revisit those numbers in December perhaps."
That gov. of New York caused thousands of deaths to elderly people. He has the highest rate of death by far than any other state. He should resign with the way he handled the virus. The gov. of Nevada is also an idiot. So few cases for how many people have visited Las Vegas.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that coronavirus came to New York predominantly from Europe and not China.The China travel ban was too late. The virus had left China and had gone to Europe.

"@ Upstate Guy.....More than 2 weeks ago (in the thread Nevada #1, on Jul 1st) you stated that everyone talking about the death rate not rising just didnt seem to understand that the death rate was LAGGING and that in a few weeks we'd all be eating crow for not taking this seriously enough. Now, more than 2 weeks later, you say the same thing. How much time needs to pass for you to realize this virus is not nearly as deadly as they claim?"
"I would add that aside from the fatality I am very worried about the reports regarding the health of survivors. Maybe it's only a few, but the interviews with those having prolonged recovery times, ""brain fog"", inability to do daily tasks due to lung issues......I find very scary! The cost to individuals that are not able to work....needing prolonged healthcare provision (even if it's only outpatient) is very worrisome."
"@WIgambler I have a friend who is 25. She was in perfect health, yoga instructor and exercise enthusiast . Zero underlying conditions . She caught covid and was hospitalized. She survived 3 weeks of hospital but now her lungs are completely screwed. So besides the death rate, the survival rate with people experiencing new types of physical damage is what to look for. Here in hawaii a child tested positive and is sick. Also zero underlying conditions. This virus is so unsteady, new facts about it on the daily. it is why the governments of the world are so afraid of it."
"""""the deaths do not support the hysteria""Oh I don't know, 10 times the death rate of the seasonal flu is pretty alarming.And that's AFTER we shut the country down for weeks.

Permanent lung damage and kidney damage are no fun either.Edited: 1:34 pm, July 17, 2020 "
"Some recent Youtube videos from inside Las Vegas casinos are showing lax discipline with mask wearing. Sometimes the mask just over the mouth, or also tucked under the chin.Somehow that needs to be improved to help stop the increasing infection rate."
"I know a guy... He said one reason death rates are lower is because the health care system has evolved into saving Covid19 patients. This information has been passed onto new hot spots. This is a good thing, but do not let the death rate falling mull you into safety, and in spite of the so called hysteria, losing 1,000 folks a day is still worrisome and downright unacceptable. This same guy had the odds of Vegas shutting down at 3-1 a couple weeks ago, he now has it at 5-1."
"Hard ten. Personally I value every human life. No matter the age. I would choose to lose every whale or chimpanzee to save one human life. But now you're about ready to move into the excess death discussion. Salty the deaths are up. The case death rate was down. Perpetual bug is right saying you liberals have been claiming for weeks that hospitals would overflow and deaths would SPIKE, yet the rate keeps falling. So how many of the 980 deaths were excess deaths? How many people die on a normal day for any reason I. This country?"
Does anybody know when Sisolak is scheduled to be speaking again? I'm kinda thinking he will announce on Twitter everything is shutting down on Monday and then go bury his head in the sand again.
I was in Vegas (downtown) between 7/1 and 7/5 AFTER the mask mandate but before bars closed. I have had 2 negative covid tests since.

"@TalbActually if our country, the Brits and our allies were so afraid of allowing for causalities the world would be speaking German right now. That includes the Japanese who would have been steamrolled by the Nazis once the allies were defeated. The normal death rate in the US is around 0.7% or so every year. If we tack on a few tenths of a percent it isn't something you would even notice unless the media hypes it. Same with oh wow Vegas is 114 today, global warming! It's hot in Vegas every single day during the summer. But you notice it more when it is brought up constantly. I'll bet once Berkeley slashes 50% from its police budget next year the death rate from violent criminals rampaging through your city will exceed that of the number of COVID-19 deaths you experience this year. Too bad, I like Rasputin and Amoeba records and the Hotel Shattuck Plaza. Had a ton of fun there with my friends when the city was quirky and weird not insane."

"Keep in mind as recently as 1968 the U.S. lost 100,000 lives and 1,000,000 died worldwide to the H3N2 flu virus.It is still around and recurs every year.This from the CDC:""The 1968 pandemic was caused by an influenza A (H3N2) virus comprised of two genes from an avian influenza A virus, including a new H3 hemagglutinin, but also contained the N2 neuraminidase from the 1957 H2N2 virus. It was first noted in the United States in September 1968. The estimated number of deaths was 1 million worldwide and about 100,000 in the United States. Most excess deaths were in people 65 years and older. The H3N2 virus continues to circulate worldwide as a seasonal influenza A virus.""That's in a US population of 200 million.Sooner or later people will have to come out of their houses.Edited: 7:46 pm, July 17, 2020 "
"And to add on to what Underpar said, this was when the population of the US was half what it is now. So that would be approx 200,000 dead in 2020 numbers, possibly more when you consider other factors such as globalization, decreased border security, increased ability to travel for the average person."
Opening it up but without a mask mandate is a bad combo.

I would want people in the government that support my agenda were I President, not people that fight against it. A difference of opinion is fine, actively working against the wishes of the boss isn't. What portion of the media does Trump control? CNN, MSNBC, Bloomberg, the networks, most of the print media with the exception of the Wall Street Journal and NY Post hate Trump. Really Breitbart and One America, along with talk radio support him. It isn't like he has minions running them either. In North Korea there is no free media. You say one wrong thing, and you go to a work camp if you are lucky. So there aren't free elections in the US? If what you say is true, the US House of Representatives would have a Republican super majority right now. If anything the Democrat Party does everything it can to rig elections. There are Democrat controlled districts where the vote count is 110%. Ballot harvesting, busing and other techniques ensure the people have no voice in these areas. Russia and China run the US? Funny, considering how Trump is anti-communist and the actual communists are Democrats or rather have co-opted the party. A pawn of Russia wouldn't stand up to them. A pawn of China wouldn't put sanctions on them and actually fight them with tariffs. Trump is actually being very benign. If I were President, I'd have my people go through every single department in government and review people's history. Laziness, corruption and incompetence gets someone immediately fired.

"Yes, the Constitution as written. If an amendment is approved then you follow that as it is now part of the supreme law of the land. We shouldn't have government workers try to strip our 2nd Amendment rights for instance. And yes, loyalty oaths to our Constitution and to the citizens of this country, the people who are the true leaders of this nation."
"“ Yes, the Constitution as written. If an amendment is approved then you follow that as it is now part of the supreme law of the land.”So the decisions of the Supreme Court don’t count?"
"""As written"" Since the 2nd doesn't define ""arms"", we will let Webster do it and as such I declare them to be the appendages emanating from your shoulders."
"Well, “ as written” would apply to when it was created. So...I’m all in favor of anyone to carry a musket around. Bow and Arrows. That sort of thing.“ As written “, the 2nd Amendment didn’t say anything about automatic weapons at all. Or assault rifles. So I guess they’re not allowed. I mean, if you believe in strictly following things “ as written “."
"Exactly IF...“as written“ back then, no possible idea of automatic weapons, assault rifles etc..."
"It was written vaguely as the Founders knew military technology would advance. If someone can afford one and pass a comprehensive background check, I have no problem with people owning a . 50 cal, a belt fed machine gun, or a flame thrower.

“ It was written vaguely as the Founders knew military technology would advance.”I wonder why they didn’t put that in writing?
"""As soon as I move to a pro gun state, I'm buying a Barrett M82. Home defense and all.""So you're keen to move somewhere where you'd feel it necessary to arm yourself with a semi-automatic rifle for self defense?"
"The 2nd was written to protect against a standing federal army, as the military might of a nation was measured by their navy. The British Army was the tool of tyranny of the Crown as highlighted in the 4th, as well. Armies were raised during wartime. The 2nd has been obsolete in regards to it's ""as written"" mission beginning with the Mexican - American War when the militia model was largely abandoned in favor of volunteers."
"""If someone can afford one and pass a comprehensive background check, I have no problem with people owning a . 50 cal, a belt fed machine gun, or a flame thrower.""So you don't believe in ""as written "" because this is clearly an infringement."
"Thank you PB. As long as it is legal, I'd keep that in mind. Do you have an FFL? Jam, I could live in a gated community with armed guards. I could be President, surrounded by Secret Service, I'd still want to carry a weapon. A gun is a tool, like a knife or a hammer. You don't want to have to use it, but better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it."
@DirtyThe 2nd was written to protect against a tyrannical government taking away our rights. The 1st and 2nd are the rights that are the foundation for all of the others. Without them the Constitution is worthless.
A standing federal army was how that tyranny was delivered on The People and the 2nd was written to prevent that tool from being formed.

Back in the 80's the experts didn't know that. Proto-Karens everywhere were terrified of it.
The Kyle's and Karen’s have a plan when they don’t wear a mask. The guy in the Florida Costco who wouldn’t wear a mask and started charging towards people yelling and he Was concealed carrying so that could of gotten ugly. Step one: don’t wear a mask go into a store or building that requires you to wear a mask. Step two: lose your mind on any employee or fellow citizens who asks you to wear a mask. Step three: get booted from the store kicking and screaming while everyone records it. Step four: video goes viral and you lose your job and respect of many. Step five: public apology to local paper. Rinse and repeat.

"So then, FLW, we didn't ban unprotected sex because? How is this different than masks?"

No one is mandating what you wear inside the 4 walls of your home.
"Pns ya they did t ban it because they were happy to see the gay community decimated. So t even try it. As a cis white Straight male You have zero validity talking about aids epidemic If you only knew what it was like for us I. The community. You are right though , the government was in total denial and thought it was Just a gay disease and plague."
"Taiwan, with a population of 23M, has stopped the COVID-19 with a general screening strategy and having people wear masks. As of June, Taiwan had just 443 cases and 7 deaths. In Asian countries, it is common for people to wear masks to prevent COVID-19.Here in the U.S we have 3.7M cases and nearly 140,000 deaths, and have many people who just refuse to wear masks."
"@AngelinaMaybe. But, here's the thing, I as a straight, white, Trump supporting male am on your side with regards to the AIDS epidemic. I have no fear of a gay person because of HIV/AIDS or anything else. Worst thing that happens to me at The Abbey or any gay bar is I get hit on and say no thanks. However, the attitude of saying my viewpoint has no validity or whatever is what gets people irritated and turns people off from any cause you might have. I don't have to be gay, black, Muslim, Jewish, sick, a woman whatever to sympathize with someone. I might not agree with someone on a lifestyle choice, that doesn't mean I have to dislike them or not treat them like a human being.

LifeStyle choice? very interesting choice of words. well we don’t need your sympathy what we need is your action and unfortunately your actions through your words have proven to be quite the opposite of what you are trying to convey as if you are our ally. Again choice of words! you say lifestyle choice how can you be remotely sympathetic when you’ve chosen that word to describe A people.You have zero validity commenting on the aids epidemic especially because you seem to be clueless as to why the government did what they did because they thought it was just a gay disease and who cares about the gays right?

PNS has a way of shoving his foot down his mouth with ridiculous comments. I have no fear of a gay person because of HIV/AIDS or anything else. Worst thing that happens to me at The Abbey or any gay bar is I get hit on and say no thanks
"Wow PnS, are you really inferring that being gay is a ""lifestyle choice""?"
I guess “ Some of my best friends...” is coming next.
"If you find yourself stuck in a hole PnS, the first thing to do is stop digging.You used the wrong word in post 154. You said sympathize when you meant empathize. I point this out not to be the grammar police, but that it's very telling. To understand the difference requires one to be capable of empathy. Looking at the rest of the comment shows you clearly are not. I am certain you will have absolutely no clue what I'm talking about."
#160...sent you a message.
Oh I'm so happy to see PnS show some more of his terrible biases.
Some people here are just not young enough to know everything.
"How am I biased? I treat people the same. You might not like my words, but I don't look at people and blow smoke up their butts and tell them what they want to hear. See, this is the problem. Instead of being happy that there are people like me in the GOP vs much of the old guard who were very dogmatic and yes even intolerant, I get criticized because my viewpoints don't align with yours in the way the left wants. It's either woke dujour or you are a racist, homophobe, sexist, etc. Instead of celebrating moments like Peter Thiel getting a standing round of applause when he said “Of course, every American has a unique identity, I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an American.” We get crap like this where my words of support are twisted somehow into something evil. Same happens to POTUS, or even celebs that suddenly express a view point that diverges from leftist orthodoxy. This garbage right here is why the left will eventually lose. Everything is evil, everything is wrong and everything needs to be changed, other than ironically the real problems this country faces and the real tragedies that effect our citizenry. It's like people trying to renovate a house and complaining about the new paint on the walls and the design of the faucets when the walls are full of termites and mold, and the plumbing is rusted."
"#164 at least you have established that you despise everything the Left represents ,at least to you.Why are you so comfortable lumping every one who disagrees with you as left extremist.This might come as a shock to you that the so called Left are not all in the same lock/mind set.There are so many variations on a theme so try to open your mind a little and respect everyone as individuals."
"PnS- Your house metaphor fails because the underlying, structural issue most damaging to people in our country is poverty, a chief concern of democrats, not conservatives.When several people tell you being gay is not a lifestyle choice and you still think you’re evincing some magnanimous view on the subject, the problem is you.Edited: 12:41 pm, July 20, 2020 "

Of course being the brave courageous fellow that he is, he's happy to report that his 100% heterosexuality is intact despite all those predatory gay men trying to convert him.He then laments that the REAL problem all the homosexuals have is that they don't listen more to his views.

"You know, there are just some people with fragile egos who always want to be right. Their self-image gets threatenened, and they try too hard to make themselves look smarter. It's a coping mechanism to deal with their insecurity. And yeah, it can annoy many of us who really are the last word."
"This is for PnS. Do want to know how you think about this. You have brought up the second amendment a number of times. Saying it should interpreted as written. Here is the exact wording:"" A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""So as written do you believe that we should be able to buy fully automatic machine guns, shoulder held missile launchers, IED's, hand grenades, and whatever else you can think of. Wouldn't they ALL be considered arms? Are they regulated for the greater good of society or do the regulations infringe on your rights? Guess the same would go for masks. Told to wear them in public for the greater good of society or does this also infringe on your freedom. Hard to fathom that one does and one does not. Your thoughts.Edited: 1:48 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Everything is a lifestyle choice. You can be gay and want to be straight. Probably won't work well for you but that happens. I'd advise against doing this, better to just be yourself and be happy, but it is not my place to stop someone. You can be straight and work in gay porn. You can be an alcoholic and choose to never drink. You can be a punk and yet put on a suit and go to work to make a living. You might innately be something but it is how you live your life that matters. Again, I don't care what you are, how you treat me matters, and your personality, your morals, values. I've said this before and I'll say it again, I have more in common with a gay Muslim man from Nigeria who shares my beliefs in America, faith, and other things than I do a straight white Christian man who supports policies that are antithetical to mine. I'd much rather call the former a friend than the latter. Now that doesn't mean I don't have friends on the left. One of my close friends supports Antifa and wanted Bernie. She's one of the people I've hung out at a few gay bars with. We are having drinks Saturday. She knows my beliefs, I know hers. We get along well. I don't have a problem with someone unless they have a problem with me. Don't care if people like me, while I'd prefer it, I'm not going to be anything other than myself. Tolerance isn't always agreeing with something, it means putting up with something, civilly.Edited: 1:51 pm, July 20, 2020 "

"I would say with regards to the question on the 2nd, that yes you should be able to buy most of those items. Now like with anything including free speech, there are limits, however, consider this. Who the heck can afford a belt fed machine gun? That Barrett M82 I mentioned is $10,000. The bullets can run up to about $7 per. A machine gun costs way more. Aside from cost, portability and usability is a factor. You know what guns are the most dangerous? Ones that are cheap, portable, and easily to conceal. Those are handguns. People commit the most crimes with them. If someone in West Virginia wants to spend $30,000 on a gun and shoot it on their 10 acre property, who cares? That guy isn't going to harm anyone. Now certain weapons should require more enhanced background checks. But that is commonsense. If someone wants some claymores make them jump through enough hoops to tire out a show dog. If they are caught committing a violent crime with them, make the punishment severe. As for "" A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" It was written this way for a reason. Anyone should be could be a defender our of Constitution. A militia isn't a standing army, it is all of us. We register for the Selective Service for a reason."
"Ah yes, that commonplace scenario of the straight porn actor who decides (as a lifestyle choice) to work in gay porn rather than in straight porn. I bet gay porn actors everywhere are utterly fed up with straight porn actors constantly doing this."
"@BigSee, you can't win. It's either do this or you are __________. If I dislike a certain group, why would I hang out with them? Why would I be their friend? You can disagree with someone on something and still like them, still appreciate them, and respect their viewpoint, even if you strongly disagree with it. Only thing I disagree with this person on is their political ideology. We don't talk politics. We share other interests that make us happy."
"@JamYou'd be surprised how many straight male porn stars do gay work too. I don't know how the gay male porn stars feel so I can't speak on that, but this is a thing. The SFV area of LA is huge into this industry. This is common knowledge here."
"PnS, thinking about it a little more I daresay that it probably does happen to some extent in the porn industry, in both male and female gay porn.But that's people acting/pretending to be gay for the purpose of their profession, I suppose. It's not the same as what you inferred earlier, i.e., that one's true sexuality is a lifestyle choice."
"PnS, your views on the 2nd are reasonable and commonsense and please hang onto them, but that position requires you to give up the notion you are an ""as written"" Constitutionalist.What time each day do you decide to be a straight male? Do you leave a post-it note on the shaving mirror to remind you? Are you so conflicted by your natural instincts that a conscious decision is necessary and you assume this is true for the rest of the world?  Newsflash: it's innate in all of us."
"Correct, sexuality, race, sex are all innate. Now how we choose to present ourselves to the world is a lifestyle choice. That is what I am saying. No one should be forced to change who they really are or hide it. People often do, some don't. Sometimes people lie to get what they want if in a situation it becomes advantageous to do so. That is a choice."
"""You can be an alcoholic and choose to never drink.""Alcoholism, a disease is a life style choice too?"
"Meanwhile, I'm fascinated to learn that the gun control debate is about $10,000 machine guns with $7 bullets. Not the, you know, $600 AR 15 assault rifles you can buy at a sporting goods store."
Probably shouldn't introduce addiction into a discussion as already convoluted as this one. We currently have plenty of tangents to go careening off into. Lol
Indeed. Does someone have a actual Vegas travel related question?

"DTC, my fascination with words and sentence structure, and how differing meanings can be read into words and sentences probably stems more from being educated in an English Grammar school, combined with a love of certain UK comedians of that time who were particularly skilled at word play, such as Ronnie Barker and Bob Monkhouse.One of my favourite jokes/lines is from the late great Bob Monkhouse :""They laughed when I said I was going to be a comedian. Well, they're not laughing now"".: )(Btw, I'm not really a maths teacher. Just gently pulling CRW''s leg!)"

It was about five weeks ago that new cases started a steady climb before exploding three weeks ago. Sure enough about two weeks ago deaths began a steady climb.

"@Tom,Going by the data where the labs are inflating positive cases by 10X or more, that would mean the real infection rate is 2.5% or less. But hey, 25% is fine too. That just means very shortly everyone in Florida will be infected, herd immunity is achieved and the Democrat Party and media will have to find a new scary thing to use against Trump."
"At least now we know PnS's new tactic, the numbers are all fake! After spewing one right wing lie after another he's gone back to the start, it's all a hoax.Who spoon fed this one to you? OAN? Brietbart?"
I guess PNS ( Please No Statistics) doesn’t believe the ICU capacity numbers nor the hospitalization rates...
Fox35 Orlando. Unless a local news outlet is part of the vast right wing conspiracy. https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-inv…Heaven help us when these indie labs start doing batch testing. It's going to be one giant s*** show.
"So faulty paperwork in some smaller labs is happening. Yes, it will affect the positivity rate to some degree. They need to get that fixed.Now then, please explain the leap in wackadoodle logic that this in any way means Florida is inflating new cases 10X?"
"Negative , positive results so less important then ICU capacity rates and hospitalization rates.... I think a mask less, gun lover from Cali can even agree with that FACT"
"@QdogI don't. Firstly, ICU's are still catching up from all of the delayed cases from the lockdowns. Like a hotel, hospitals tend to plan out capacity. Hospitals make a lot of money from their ER's and ICU's. Ideally a hospital will want an ICU to be around 80% or so full on any given day. So, we have in many instances the hospitals playing catch up with patients and are already very close to or even over the ""alert"" baseline for a state and then we add in a few COVID patients which automatically triggers the alert. Let's say a state has 1,000 ICU beds. Maybe 700 are already full from non COVID patients. COVID patients equal maybe 100. There is still 200 beds left. This is normal. Now that doesn't mean some hospitals won't max out capacity, but unless we deny service to anyone not COVID, this is the reality. I'm sure during flu season this happens too. This utilization rate is a bad way to look at things. Just one more tool in the box of fear."
"45 labs failed to include negative tests. So of course the tests they reported were 100% positive. But more than 300 labs were doing it right. The total positive tests reported by the 45 labs are less than 3000 out of the 300,000+ confirmed Fla cases. It is statistically insignificant to the infection rate.Labs as rule are not required to report negative tests because how many Floridians test negative for an STD doesn't matter. However with a novel virus those numbers are important, but perhaps some labs didn't realize the import or maybe got bad or misleading directions from above. But it is not some nefarious plot to corrupt or manipulate the numbers. Even DeSantis addressed this."
"PnS, just making up numbers."
"ICU occupancy in the US averages between 57.4% and 82.1%, with a mean of 68.2%. Hospitals can't and don't maintain ICUs at 80% to drive up costs.https:/…"
"Faulty paper work on this level would be career hurting at best, ending at worst if it wasn't COVID related. In my wife's lab, if one sample is reported positive and immediately afterwards the scientist realizes they made a mistake, this becomes a big problem that has to be addressed by the Dept. Supervisor, her (the Lab Manager), the Medical Director, and Lab Ops Director. In cases where an entire run was faulty it causes significant grief. The error goes up the chain of command even higher, to where a Regional VP might get involved as a client will take issue with this. The mistake is documented and if the employee makes this mistake again they will most likely be terminated. Heaven help someone where it involves a life and death test or where it could mean jail for someone being tested for say drugs. Now this doesn't mean that the Florida rate is 10x lower, but judging by how many labs have a 10X or over mistake rate, it certainly is possible. Regardless we know it is significantly inflated. I have no idea what the COVID PCR and serology test numbers are out of Florida but I assume similar to what CA is doing, and that is a lot."
"“ Firstly, ICU's are still catching up from all of the delayed cases from the lockdowns.”Yeah. Patients without Covid who needed Intensive Care a couple months ago just stayed home. Now they’re coming in for their Intensive Care. Because that’s how it works."
"The reporting error did not affect the outcomes. They just failed to include all the negative results. Why can you not grasp this? Lab A did 1000 tests. 45 were positive and they report those to the state agency. The state agency assumes they are reporting all Covid tests done regardless of outcome and so 45 out of 45 is 100% not knowing the lab disregarded the 955 negative tests and the state agency has no idea that they even exist.Edited: 5:14 pm, July 21, 2020 "

"Well actually Jam, the number of heart attacks, strokes, other serious events declined considerably during the first two months of COVID. People still had these things and other major events but often declined getting treatment or put it off. This of course often turns a medium sized problem into a major one down the road."
"PnS, I suspect you're deliberately missing the point that was being made, that intensive care treatment by definition isn't something that can be deferred and 'caught up' with at a later date."
Undercounting cases and underreporting deaths
So how do you account for the decrease in heart attacks and other serious things?
Over counting cases and over reporting deaths.
see 269
"""So how do you account for the decrease in heart attacks and other serious things?""True or not, that's not relevant to the point. Stop obfuscating."
"There must be some elective procedures that may require a brief ICU stay post-op. And people were definitely avoiding/ignoring things that might have required a hospital visit due to the unknowns early in the pandemic.Edited: 6:19 pm, July 21, 2020 "

"From the horses mouthPresident Donald Trump warned Tuesday the coronavirus pandemic in the United States will probably “get worse before it gets better.” “That’s something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is, it’s what we have,′ he said."
"I total agree with Susan G out of Houston #221, Fact!!!!!!!! A family of 4 from California went to get tested for the Virus. They filled out the paperwork and stood in line. 2 hrs later they didn't move that much and the kids were getting Antsy, so they left (without being tested). Three weeks later they received in the mail the results of their test!!!! 3 positive and 1 negative. If you die for any reason, since you died during this pandemic your labeled as a virus death. If you sneeze, cough or rub your eyes you have the virus. Another good one and this is also Fact. If you have lets say Cancer and you go to one doctor for a visit and you have the virus your counted. If you go to the same Doctor the following week and you have the virus your counted again!! So if your a terminally ill person and you go to the Doctors evveryweek you get counted every time you go. So to make a long story short if one person visits a Doctor 15times in 15 weeks you get counted 15times for one person"
I’d start with asking why terminally ill patients are going to the doctor every week. During a pandemic.

"327, Governors BEGGED the federal government to take over testing. Democratic governors. They begged the federal government to use powers it already had. Had the federal government done so we'd easily be at the needed one million tests a day. The wait for results wouldn't take a week. Testing supplies would be plentiful. Billions would've been saved. Remember Trump's news conference back in March? The one that was like an infomercial where he paraded all the CEO's? Trump then in fact promised a federalized approach to testing. Thousands of drive up clinics at Wal Marts and Targets. Remember his federal data base run by Google he promised? My god, it would be a huge help now. All 50 Governors were THRILLED at this news. The federal government would do what they simply couldn't. It was a great day.Too bad every single thing Trump said that day was a complete and total lie."
"So? In other news, thousands were diagnosed with colds, tuberculosis, measles, west Nile, flu, and on and on. Not to mention, fires, car accidents, tripping, choking, and drowning. Fearmonger"
"Who could possibly think that a mask you’ve had for a week or one that was made by the lady at the dry cleaner, is sterile and protecting you from anything. So ridiculous"
The governors are in charge of their states. Educate yourself so you don’t show your ignorance.
"NOCO, just another denier..You must have missed the presser where the current windbag in WH has come out and finally said WEAR A MASK...perhaps you might now change your mind..."
"This notion that masks need to be sterile isn't correct. That's not why they're worn. Although that is not to say you can't get via a contaminated mask of course. But the main reason we wear them is to protect others by having a mask block the droplets we propel when we sneeze, cough, talk, and even breathe. They essentially are keeping the air cleaner. Again, wearing a clean mask has value of course, but unlike say in a medical environment. it's not essential.Noco, google Federalism some time. You'll learn something."
"UpstateThe companies that have the ability to test for COVID are. If the Federal Government got involved it wouldn't have done anything. You still need lab space, machines to run it, trained scientists, reagents and time. You also can't simply focus on COVID, testing labs have a multitude of other very important tests they need to run for things that are far far more urgent. With the mistakes that happened at these small labs in Florida and other places you don't want some small town, tiny lab running these things. With batching hopefully we can significantly increase the numbers of tests run and also importantly conserve money and resources, specifically reagents by doing this.Edited: 10:45 am, July 22, 2020 "
"If the current Federal Government were to make a massive push to ""take over"" any part of government that conflicts with what state govenors think is their turf there would be outcries of fascism!!The totalitarian monster must be stopped!!!! Etc.Our Constitution essentially calls the states and feds equal partners."
"""You still need lab space, machines to run it, trained scientists, reagents and time.""This is precisely why the federal government needed to oversee testing. Without a significant long tern investment, say 250 million tests over 12 months, the labs aren't going to commit the resources needed to scale up. The states can't do this. Instead the scale up has been piece meal, too slow and not enough. Had the federal government done so in March, without question we'd be at double the capacity and results would still be quicker. And it would've saved billions."
"1.) When at any point in modern history has the government ever done anything cheaper and more efficient than the private sector? 2.) You could run 300,000,000 tests for COVID a day in theory. You need the resources to do this. First and foremost A.) Scientists that are licensed and qualified to run the test and that are actually willing to work with or around it. Several employees I know of have acted like the samples are going to just jump out of the tubes. Basically not everyone is qualified to work with the stuff. B.) Enough reagents to mix with the samples. This can either be created in house or offsite depending on the test being run. C.) Other equipment such as test tubes, pipet tips which btw are a real problem getting right now, etc. D.) Setting up a lab isn't cheap and easy. Finding suitable properties and negotiating leases for the sheer number and size of test sites would take months, not to mention needed Tenant Improvements which could take weeks if not months more. While the GSA has a database of government buildings that could work. Again, you are still looking at a significant amount of time as the government is as slow as molasses. 3.) As Underpar so correctly stated, the states don't want Trump to control anything. They want money, which they will then siphon off into other unrelated projects like road diets, homeless housing, pensions, to fix their ailing economies, etc."

"I hate to tell you this, but it is extremely doubtful that Trump will be President beyond January 19, 2021. How do you think he would be in office for another 8 years. Are you unaware that the U.S. has a 2-term limit. In this case, he will be voted out after one terrible term."

Eventually, 150,000 accounts affiliated with QAnon will be impacted with less visibility for other Twitter users.The announcement comes as QAnon has trickled into mainstream politics and conversation, experts who study the beliefs and growing movement behind it say.QAnon supporters holding up ""Q"" signs have been spotted at rallies for President Donald Trump, who has regularly retweeted QAnon-linked accounts; candidates with ties to the group have won Congressional primaries; and Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, recently posted a video using phrases and slogans tied to the conspiracy theory.see Yahoo News for complete article.Edited: 10:40 am, July 23, 2020 "

"PnsfromLAIn the grand scheme of things I would consider the two examples below to be in modern history,WWII. The government did pretty well with that. Can you imagine a bunch of private companies competing for contracts to fight that war? The Interstate Highway System. The federal government did a pretty good job on that one."
"Actually DTC I borrowed that one from Diamond and Silk. @VpearlkcLiterally one of the few reasons a government exists is to protect its citizens from other nations. However, let's be real here, what have we actually achieved in the last several wars we fought? Now I don't mean to diminish the contribution of any of our brave soldiers but let's see:Korea: Didn't fight until the commies were destroyed. The citizens of North Korea now live in what is basically hell on Earth. 40,000 dead American heroes. Vietnam: Didn't fight until the commies were destroyed. 58,200 dead American heroes. Gulf War: Didn't fight until our enemy was destroyed. The Iraqi people suffered. 219 dead American heroes. War on Afghanistan: 2,420 dead American heroes. Afghanistan is slightly better, but the Taliban still survive. So from the Revolutionary War to WW2 the American government could be counted on to do what was necessary to win. After brave men like MacArthur, Nimitz, Bradley, Patton came a bunch of arm chair Generals who were more politician than soldier. Not all but many. The bravery found in our enlisted men and women and lower/mid ranked officers is often absent when you get near the top of the food chain. As for the highway system, I believe I mentioned recent works. To be fair, while the highway system is impressive, it's designers didn't think long term and future capacity needs. Still impressive. How about something from this century?Edited: 1:12 pm, July 23, 2020 "

Please check this for yourself before shouting at meThis seems to be a International problem, in London there have been multiple ""demonstrations"" by the BLM movement, with very few face coverings seen & no social distancing whatsoever.Maybe we in the west have too many choices?

They all say the same thing and that this whole thing is way overblown and the healthy should be out contributing to herd immunity. Can anyone tell me another time in history where we have quarantined the healthy? To my knowledge this has never happened. Masks are only helpful if used and worn correctly which includes cleaning and or changing them regularly which doesn't happen. Not saying it isn't bad. The sick and elderly need to be protected instead of sending infected patients into nursing homes like Cuomo did in New York. There are thousands of doctors out there saying the same thing."

Therefore I am going to base my decisions on what I know to be true and the probability that it is happening elsewhere as well, not on what people on both sides want you to think. Both sides can drum up scientist, doctors, scholars or whoever to support their agenda. Same with the so called fact checkers. Having said all of this I do still follow the rules because even if I don't agree with a lot of this I am still trying to be as safe as I can for myself and the people around me."

It is because you say it is. Sorry I am going to believe something I see with my own eyes before I believe something you tell me to be so. Sorry if that is a big blow to your ego. You can call it whatever you want to call it. I call it the truth because I know it to be true.

"PnS, the Brexit 'Remain' campaign raised valid concerns about the adverse effect leaving the EU without a deal would have on the UK's economy. It was the 'Leave' campaign that arrogantly dismissed and labelled those concerns as 'Project Fear' (the same Leave campaign that also touted the blatant mistruth that the UK sends £350m a week to the EU).With the Transitional Period ending after 31/12/2020, the UK still hasn't negotiated a trade deal with the EU, and in many cases still hasn't negotiated trade deals with other non-EU countries. These deals can take years to set up, if agreed at all. Without them the UK will revert to trading on WTO terms, which means that we will be able to neither buy/import goods nor sell/export what little we do manufacture here at anywhere near the favourable terms we enjoyed as part of the EU. This will make goods in the UK more expensive, and will make it a more expensive place to do business (many large multi-national businesses operating in the UK have made it clear they will relocate if the UK leaves without a deal)."

"We hit a milestone today. 150,000 deaths from Covid 19 so far in the USA."
"Dr. Dan Erickson, owner of Accelerated Urgent Care, spoke at Monday’s “White Coat Summit” on Capitol Hill as part of a greater effort to extinguish fears surrounding the Coronavirus and reminded the public that “99.8 percent of people get through this with little to no progressive or significant disease.”Erickson addressed the dominant narrative of rising cases of the virus within the U.S. and pointed out that it is causing undue fear.“A case is a person, healthy, that tested positive. The vast majority. But the public hears cases and thinks, ‘Oh my goodness. These are sick people!’ No the vast majority — 99.8 percent of people get through this with little to no progressive or significant disease,” Erickson said.The focus should not center on cases, he continued. Rather, the narrative should focus on hospitalizations and deaths that “are appropriately coded on a death certificate,” he said, stressing “appropriately coded.”“This is the first time I’ve seen quarantining healthy,” he continued. “I don’t know if you guys think that’s normal. I find that very strange.”While he said it was good that the U.S. prepared for the worse, Erickson said we must be “realistic with the response.”“Who showed up? Most of the patients that were showing up for me were very mild illness,” he said, adding that he wanted to come out and “give reality to the situation on the ground and sort of help dispel some fear that people have had.”Erickson also addressed the mass lockdowns across the country, explaining that they were “very successful,” but in all the wrong metrics:He said:Was the lockdown successful? I say yes very successful. Successful in things like this. Anxiety hotline calls up 1000 percent. Child abuse both sexual and non up. Financially, emotional distress, Suicide. Alcohol. 150,000 Americans a month not receiving cancer screening. It’s been effective alright, in all the wrong metrics — in all the areas we didn’t want it to be effective. Delay in medical care. We talked about that. Orthopedics, nonessential. Suicide calls up 600 percent. Suicide calls. We heard other doctors mention this. So was the lockdown effective? If that’s the effect you were going for, then yes but it was trying to flatten the curve but it had these secondary consequences that I think are devastating. People staying indoors. No exercising as you mentioned. No Vitamin D.“I’m watching people in their Prius by themselves driving with a mask on. There’s no sense to it,” he added. “It’s fear.”"
"""Rather, the narrative should focus on...""Thanks, Breitbart article, for confirming what sensible people know - that the facts are not in question, but that you want to change the narrative about those facts."
What's the basis for thev 99.8% figure? Sincere question.

"Right. “ That” Doctor.I remember a few of my Facebook friends posting his misguided “ advice” a few months back. And then quietly removing it when it proved to be wrong.“ A news conference by two California doctors that downplayed the threat of the coronavirus and made dubious claims that the disease had already spread widely, and therefore was not dangerous, struck a chord with those itching for states to ease stay-at-home orders — but is being condemned by public health officials and experts.A widely shared local television video of last week’s news conference, which was posted on YouTube, reached more than 5 million views and was amplified by Elon Musk and Fox News, where Dr. Dan Erickson and Dr. Artin Massihi appeared on primetime shows two nights in a row.”https:/…Just the fact that this conference is being called a “ Capitol Hill” meeting is funny. They’re in a hotel. The Hyatt Regency. Not a bad choice. But the “ Capitol Hill” thing is meant to fool people that it’s some type of Congressional hearing. In DC, “ going up on the hill” means attending something official like a hearing. Or testifying. Or meeting with a legislator or staff on an issue.This ain’t that. Poseurs."

"Fauci does all theoretical work and hasn't seen a patient in person in decades. Would you trust getting business advice from a guy who runs his own manufacturing company that he started and goes into every day, or the guy who sells the book on how to run a business that hasn't actually run a business? Everything he says is theoretical. The man doesn't even follow his own advice. He constantly takes his mask off (not in the right way either). He flip flops on positions and is by far the most gloomy, depressing person out there right now. Nothing positive from him ever."

"PnS, you scrutinize Fauci. What do you think Trump has done wrong?"
"'Irishfan, I think one of the biggest ironies with Trump is that it is he who coined the phrase 'fake news'.""From across the sea, you got it. In fact, almost everything negative he says about other people is usually a personality flaw that he embodies."
"DTCFirst thing Trump did wrong was to ever trust Fauci and Scarf in the first place. Second thing was to allow Fauci on stage. Once he did that he lost control of the narrative. Then implementing the travel ban/national emergency the way he did. It spooked the world. There were other errors here as well, one was not replenishing our stockpile of PPE on a national level. Why we didn't have a general pandemic response team vs one focused simply on ebola is stupid. Why he isn't using the threat of the virus to build the wall faster is beyond me too."
"PNSSo the current state of the nation is again blamed on the previous president, the one who actually put together a pandemic playbook and response team that Trump dismantled when he took office? At what point do you point the finger on that incompetent conman, or have you fully closed off your mind to anything that contradicts the narrative you want to believe?"

"So, shut Vegas completely down again and do any and all possible to ensure Trump loses in November,then (assuming we can't toss him out earlier) ? Those appear to be among the ultimate solutions for all these Vegas / Nevada dilemmas from the most vocal majority here. For those who do believe that, how do you address the financial fallout from it all? Or, are those aspects just completely secondary to the almighty virus ( in no way am I intending to minimize the Covid debilitated / dead) ? Are any and all government sourced stimulus / relief funds ( UI / SBA,direct payments, etc) going to be more quickly disbursed than that observed with any of the previous stimulus rounds ( eg how will the Vegas workforce, business owners, and general financial infrastructure survive a second shuttering )? How do we fix it..or is it beyond repair already...despite Las Vegas' historical economic resilience? Limp along and enforce Covid guidelines ( continue the Sisolak approach), or..shut the b*tch down manana? Not to worry as our esteemed US Congressional members (from all sides) are entering serious debates ( or photo-op pandering exercises,imo) this week regarding the phase 4 stimulus. Comforting, isn't it?This is just a repeat topic post observed in several forms beginning in Feb./March 2020 ( and every day thereafter), I'm aware. I figure it's OK to revisit the past ( which is now the present again) on occasion.BTW, the SNHD dashboard updated today (7/27/2020) indicates a static and / or downward trend in both hospitalization and death rates in Clark County, FWIW. I realize that trend could and will change due to reporting lags, positive case symptom lags,all that; but for a moment in time, it's a good thing to observe. Maybe we can be cautiously optimistic / glass-half-full about the recently enacted Nevada mask mandate and it's early effects on Covid stats. Maybe we can be cautiously optimistic about something. That'll make some of you come out the woodwork..that's OK..For all those planning Vegas trips soon...have a good time.Edited: 2:08 am, July 28, 2020 "

"Coming from the UK, we've not exactly had a good experience here, but things are much better now.I love coming to Las Vegas and try to twice a year. However, it's beyond me why anyone would choose to visit somewhere where you spend most of your time indoors with other people, many of who visit from other states where the virus is also not in control. Masks are only going to help so far. I'm sorry for the employees who will be having such a hard time but it's inevitable the casinos will have to close again and maybe not open again until after the inevitable winter wave has passed."
@DTC...Think so? Go vote....
"May i offer this observation and question, DTC, what color is the sky in your world?"
".""Think so? Go vote""....too bad it ain't that simple."
"Looks like the phasing is being abandoned and a business-focused approach is being taken.https:/…It seems a better approach, that some businesses will be under the threat of closure if the mandates are not observed. The self-policing should have been more rigorous from the outset. Hopefully, the new measures will improve that."
Good. Shut down non compliant businesses. If masks are not worn by staff and patrons while not eating there must be consequences if we ever want to get back to normal.
"@nuzzja..Feel free to digress about any really important complications and/or solutions you might have. If Trump's ouster is the key to solving the entire planet's problem set encountered since the inception of time, voting him out is the best way to legally accomplish that..less than a hundred days from now..paradise and utopia are within your grasp. Not much fun in that approach though, is there?"

In his 36 years in Congress, of the 533 bills he sponsored only 42 passed. He literally lied about his academic credentials in 1987 and actually plagiarized the speech by British Labour Party Neil Kinnock delivered just four months prior in 1988. According to Bob Gates who also served under Obama, every foreign affairs advice Biden gave were wrong. Even Obama tried to discourage him from the beginning and their party elite are still talking of taking the nomination from him at the convention.

Now on to another subject. What's up with Louis Gohmert? He was promised a ride on Air Force 1 and now he's been kicked off..

"Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) on Wednesday suggested that he contracted coronavirus because he wore a mask more frequently in recent days.“I can’t help but think that if I hadn’t been wearing a mask so much in the last 10 days or so, I really wonder if I would have gotten it,” he said in an interview with The American Independent.In a later statement on Twitter, he explained that he often touches his face while wearing his mask to make it comfortable. “I can’t help but wonder if that put some germs in the mask,” he said.The Texas lawmaker, who tested positive on Wednesday morning, had previously made a point of refusing to wear a mask while in the CapitolThis guy is dumber then a box of rocksEdited: 6:57 pm, July 29, 2020 "

"""Trump's party is my party. We are the future.""Hate to break it to you, but the backbone of today's GOP, the Baby Boomers, were actually surpassed in 2017 as the dominant demographic voting bloc, and their decline will only intensify each and every year. Quite simply they are dying off. Sure the next generation will grow more conservative as they age, they always do, but their numbers are nowhere near that of the Boomers. Meanwhile the generation turning 18 over the next decade is the largest one as a percentage of the population since the Boomers in the 60's. And the diversity of this generation is considerably higher. And boy oh boy are they liberal.Of course the GOP will survive, but just as the Democrats moved right in the 80's and 90's to survive, the Republicans will move left. Immigration reform, single payer health care at the very least, and many other contested issues will now receive both parties' support. The landscape will be totally changed.This is partly why we have Trump. Deep down I think most conservatives know the party is over, they had a 40 year run but time has run out. So they flexed their political muscles one last time in a nihilistic temper tantrum. Look at what is got us. In a decade, at least from a political standpoint the Boomers will be finished.

This is the new right which frankly borrows a lot from the libertarian side of things. Trump is the blunt instrument we need right now to destroy the system. What comes after him will be a scalpel to cut out the last diseased remains that infect the party and our country. That scalpel would ideally be a woman. Biden is and always was a loser. The ""experts"" and the media said everything was fine re COVID until mere days after they helped Biden to steal the Dem nomination from Bernie. Then everything went to hell because it was operation do anything possible to keep Trump from winning. I actually mentioned something bad would happen, one more big shot to take out Trump while waiting in line to vote during the March primary.

@691I don't think Trump will attend Cains funeral. He is probably really enraged at Cain for dying and making him and his Tulsa rally look bad.
"Re: Gym JordanYesterday he was only concerned with the shadow big-tech conspiracy to unseat his cult leader, when the hearing was supposed to be about anti-trust law.He had an outburst during Mary Scanlon's 5 minutes. He disliked her comment that they were turning ""back to anti-trust law and away from fringe conspiracy theory,"" and started shouting like a maniac that he had the leaked emails. He forced the Democrats to shout him down as he did not have the floor, and Raskin yelled twice at him, ""put your mask on!"" He finally complied and stopped yelling. He is a cretin and a bully.And knew about the sexual assault of 48 Ohio State wrestlers at the hands of his friend."
I was very sad to hear about Herman Cains passing.! He was and seemed like such a really nice human being. My heart goes out to his family and friends and I hope he will Rest In Peace.
"At least Cain died doing something he loved, attending a Trump rally. I urged all his science-denying supporters to get out to that rally and show their hero some of the love he so desperately craves.

"I honestly wish I was at that rally. I really respected Herman Cain and wanted badly for him to be President back in 2012. To have been given the ability to shake his hand and tell him this would have made me very happy. I practice what I preach. I don't tell people to go outside, do this or that and then do the exact opposite. Isolating myself, giving up the things I enjoy isn't going to make my life better. Far from it. With no risks in life, there are no rewards. A boring, beige existence dictated by someone else isn't what I desire, at least not at this point in my life. Herman Cain was 74, a Stage 4 cancer survivor and knew the risks. He died living his life, doing what he loved, though there is no proof that he was infected at that rally. He was a good man, a good American, and he will be missed by many."
I don't think Trump really believes for a minute that his call to delay the election will succeed. I think he's just getting his excuses in early.
Read PnS' latest post. As always it's about him. It never changes.
"It is about me. It's my life. Doesn't mean I don't care about others or won't make some sacrifices for them, but in the end, I have to do what is best for me and my family. I'm many things, a hypocrite isn't one of them unlike so many other people in this world today."
"@PnsI really wanted Herman Cain to win the election when he ran for President! I truly believe he would have been very good at it. As far as him contracting covid, all on here will say because he attended the rally, which in fact Herman had done a lot of traveling and I believe he was in Arizona prior to that rally.

Why did Cain post that on his blog? And then not follow? Very easy to figure that out
"Why does Fauci take his mask off when he is in a room when he thinks the cameras are turned off. Why did he take his mask off at the baseball game when his friend was sitting right next to him? Because ""yay mask"" is the politically correct thing to do. Or in Fauci's case he doesn't believe his own bs. One of the candidates for the CA-37 district seat was walking through the neighborhood he wants to get elected to and ran into an 80 year old woman in a mask. She was so happy he wasn't wearing one. Said that she only wore hers because she didn't want to get harassed. People say one thing and often do another.

Teamsters Local 631 business agent James Harmer said they usually have 3-4,000 members working full-time on a regular basis on Strip and in downtown. “Each of those members is currently completely out of work in a market where hospitality has been decimated,” said Harmer.

"Considering how messed up most of the 37th is, hopefully Karen Bass loses. Sadly I'm right outside that district. Will still be donating to Mr. Webber's campaign."
"Do it PnS, donate all you can, $50K. No, make it $100K. You can make a difference! With your help Webber might even get into double figures in percentage."
Anti Trump doesn't necessarily mean anti Republican or pro Democrat/Biden.

Bingo

"""Donald Trump used to “stroll right in” to the dressing room of beauty pageants while the contestants - some of whom were teenagers - were naked or half-dressed, a former model has claimed.""""Four women who competed in the 1997 Miss Teen USA beauty pageant also said the Republican used to walk in. Some of the girls were as young as 15."" “Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis,” Ms Dixon told CBS. “He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked.”Oh, and trump admitted it.""“I’ll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show and everyone’s getting dressed,” Trump told Stern. No men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in, because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it. … ‘Is everyone OK?' You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody OK?’ And you see these incredible-looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that.”Edited: 6:48 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"Because ""yay mask"" is the politically correct thing to do. Or in Fauci's case he doesn't believe his own bs.""Now, you are just being ignorant."
"Trump Virus: 152,000 have diedHe would rather have photo ops and talk about how great he is rather than show any empathy. He needs a heart transplant."
"If Fauci truly believed what he said, he would wear his mask every single moment he is in a building not his home, in public, or around others who aren't members of his household. However, since he is part of the elites he does not need to follow the same directives that the peasants do. In fact in DC there is an exception for government workers to the mask mandate there while they are on official business. Shocker right there, they carved an exemption for themselves. None of the pols want to wear masks, only that their subjects do. My answer to them is not suitable to write on TA. And I'd tell them this to their faces."
"“Eight years of "" leading from behind "" was also fatiguing.” - If America somehow falls to Biden, it’ll be at least another four years of his administration leading from behind little girls, right where he has been a frequent visitor over the years. The liberals are trying to categorize pedophilia as a mental disorder now, and claiming it’s just a “sexual preference.” They’re saying we should treat pedophiles with respect and dignity because they didn’t “choose” this lifestyle, and that they’re afraid to seek help because they’re ashamed and afraid of being bullied or worse. 13Edited: 7:00 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"Tdawg, please provide facts to your statement..most of us can easily provide Trump comments on his daughter, her looks, how he would date her...all there for anyone to see...I have not seen one fact about Biden and pedophilia ."
"This political / cultural division is blatantly accentuated now..under the current conditions . This pandemic has forced us all to take a deep dive into our own US (and beyond) history, our own political leanings, the other side's political leanings, and probably our own individual family's history. Part of that is simply because some of us haven't much else to do due to Covid issues and we're plain sick of it all (literally, in some cases.). We're all a bit touchy, partially because Vegas is adjusting to the dominant situation ( and is different than we're accustomed to). Everybody's pissed off for a hundred different reasons and political arguments somehow ease the pain for some. No way around it.Find something positive, perhaps? I suggest a cold beer as an initial step ( or whatever eases your conscience a bit).. We'll get through this crap...just vote your respective consciences if it's a big issue..move on."
It appears that your ongoing attacks on Fauci is meant to distract from DJT's ongoing/daily examples of ineptness and incompetence and his inability to protect our country from COVID-19.
@TdawgLoved your post #756The Liberals are a bunch of fruit cakes to put it nicely. Whack a doodle’s

"Biden has a penchant for fondling little girls, it’s a well known fact. Now, I haven’t seen him fondle them sexually, but I have seen him fondle their faces and hair and/or sniff their hair on more than a couple occasions. Again, not pedophilia, but even you, I would think, would say that’s odd behavior at the least. You’re not kidding anyone if you try to claim that you haven’t seen the same evidence. However, I didn’t say he was a pedophile, but that is squarely on several liberal agendas. 13"
"Fauci is an American hero and djt an American zero. Somebody has to fact check Trump's ignorance and lies. Fauci designed a program called PEPFAR that made lifesaving antiretrovirals available to poor people in Africa and other regions. It saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives."
#763...another attempt to distract from Trump's incompetence ! You are sounding very desperate.
"nuzzja, I look from all sides. I’ve stated my position several times, and I even voted for Obama and the clown in their 2nd term and I believe it was a terrible mistake on my part. How do I appear desperate, when I’m just stating facts that are out there?13"

As stated, I acknowledge Trump has his flaws, and some are over the line. However, the agenda Biden and the Democratic Party is socialism and I’m totally against that. 2salty, it might be creep vs creep, lmao. However, as stated above, I’m not going for this insane Democratic agenda. I mean, it’s no coincidence that the worst looting and rioting and absolute chaos is in Democrat controlled cities. This is insane. Enough is enough. Look at what real Americans are doing, and that’s driving these fools and their liberal agendas out of town. 13"
"Yep these Democratic cities are out of control. They want to say they are protesting, when in fact all it is , it’s rioting. It doesn’t make them look good at all. They all need to be locked away. I always agree that people should protest peacefully and make their statements. I think that’s great and your American Right.But the looting and violence has got to stop for everyone."
"Kissing babies is a long standing tradition in American politics. Grandfatherly Joe would be good at it. Donald on the other hand, germaphobe that he is, would never get anywhere near one. If an adoring trumpster mom held her baby up to Donald to be kissed he would recoil in disgust."

"There's no changing minds of people who've willingly surrendered their psyche and votes to Trump.

"""Trump is an idiot..""He's not THAT smart."
Poor Donald is such a tragic figure. All he really wanted was to be accepted by Manhattan Society. To them he was just a loudmouthed carnival barker from Queens. Too bad those uppercrust snobs didn't want hime in their elite social circle. The world would be a better place today and Donald would still be in Manhattan. Just my early morning thoughts as I try to help drive this monumental thread to the 1000 line.
one thousand comments and maybe 5% to 10% of any comments left have anything to do with the opening topic. Thus here is my contribution.
"Kimye, Bennifer, Brangelina, and Trumputin."
@813When has there ever been a thread that lasted any length of time that ended up on the same topic it started with. This is a monumental thread and should end up monumentally off topic. If I am lucky enough to be the 1000th poster I will make it about the rise in covid cases in Nevada.
I came here at 815 comment mark just to see where does a 800+ comment thread survive on. Truly this is a dizzying intelligence of comments. Bravo!
"“ And for what it's worth ""thugs"" is the current dog whistle of choice for Black people.” - The definition of thug according to the Oxford dictionary is: a violent person, especially a criminal. I’m an English Lit major and the word “thug” has been used in that regard since the 19th century at least. You don’t get to determine what folks mean by their words. I meant what I said, a thug is a violent criminal. That’s what y’all do though, you twist the narrative. Notice, you didn’t respond to anything I said that was a true fact, that thugs are being able to destroy Baltimore, Chicago, Seattle (the list goes on), which all happen to be Democrat run cities. Any normal person considers those people destroying those cities to be criminals, guess what, even your precious innocent Democrat brethren. Why are they allowed to do this to those cities? Why aren’t any Republican controlled cities being destroyed?Shouldn’t y’all start asking some questions and demand some answers?It’s ludicrous to think you shouldn’t. 13"

There I said it. You and him are a menace to our society.” - There are clearly two sides here. Half the United States, including several of your friends and family members voted for Trump in 2016. No matter how hard you try to deny it, you know it to be true, but they certainly didn’t and won’t tell you. Why? Because you’re a nasty person that spews your hate everywhere so they all know and wouldn’t tell you because they know the backlash they would face. If, in fact, you’re not too scared to tell them to their faces.You talk so tough on here to everyone, at the most inane topics most times that you’re squarely in that “keyboard warrior” demographic that is a straight up pony in the real world.People like you create the Silent Majority for berating and labeling EVERY Trump supporter as a racist bigot.That’s why the Silent Majority will be even stronger this November.Congratulations!Also, you do realize there are many, many black and Hispanic folks that support Trump as well? You’re labeling them as racist bigots and menaces to our society. That’s racist.13"

These things all cost money, and the money for them comes from taxes. The issue here is that we are no longer paying for the basic things a government needs to function. We also don't give people an opt out for non-essential programs they don't want to support. I'll answer 2Salty's question about what programs to cut. 1.) Social Security. Now, I think this was a poorly designed program from the beginning. It should have never been forced on people. Because cutting a government program that people now sadly rely on is almost impossible. The ONLY way to make it more fair and sustainable at least is to allow opt outs. If you opt out, which can't be undone, you still pay 20% of what you would into the Social Security system. You get to keep the other 80%. This allows people the ability to keep most of this money to invest or do whatever with. It also helps provide funding for the program for people who wish to keep it so that it stays solvent. 2.) Medicare. Same as social security. 3.) National Endowment for the Arts.4.) National Public Radio/PBS. The TV doesn't get 10 channels anymore. You want news/content, there are ample other sources to find it. 5.) Federally funded student loans for anything not STEM, medical, business. Anyone taking out a federally backed loan should be required to first take a finance course that breaks down the cost of the loan, their probably salary and future expenses and how long it will take to repay the loan. 6.) Welfare. While it shouldn't be abolished, it should be severely curtailed. Right now it is a hammock vs a safety net. 7.) Affordable Care Act. Go back to pre-ACA rules. Allow insurance companies to sell policies across state lines. Provide some protection for pre-existing conditions. 8.) Public sector unions. Should not be a thing period. Neither should lifetime pensions. Govt. should be hiring the best and paying for the best. Not hiring drones that can't be fired and giving out lifetime pensions. 9.) Almost all foreign aide. Basically cut everything down to the bone. Make our government lean, fast, and functional. Not bloated, slow and corrupt like it is now. If we had term limits for each elected govt. position and a cap on the number of elected positions a person could serve in, no pensions, and paid our elected officials based on their performance, our government would be great. If our Congress people have to raise taxes, borrow money to pay for programs, they should make minimum wage. If they match last years budget, no increase or are slightly lower in what they request, pay them each $250,000 a year. They cut massive waste, lower taxes, reduce debt then pay then $1,000,000 that year. Incentivize them to do a good job for the taxpayers."
"nuzzja, you lost me as I didn’t mention Venezuela??At least, you are trying to have a conversation though, instead of just blindly calling names and staunchly trying to defend a buffoon. I understand Socialism and I know it’s not been any good for the Socialist countries before us. 13"

"Watch Fox ""News"" personalities explain why Biden's comment, in April, that Trump might delay the election is crazy. Of course they were knee-capped when a few months later that's exactly what he suggested.https://www.youtube.com/watch…"
"The nations right wing media always uses as examples of failed socialism were never socialist states. Venezuela was and is a kleptocracy, just like the USSR.Effective social democracies are in place all over western and Northern Europe. The Scandinavian nations, Netherlands, France, and several other countries that are better-run than the United States have far more socialist principles in place.Republicans have dragged the center so far to the right that anything a responsible country would do in the name of taking care of its citizenry is decried as socialism. Why is all the corporate welfare we engage in OK with some people? What do you think the fake socialism of Joe Biden is going to take away from you and give to others?"
"TDawg, attack the messenger when you have no counter to the message.White nationalists and Nazis share the same racist ideology. Do you deny that?And really, a guy who defends Trump talks about credibility? I don't even know where to start with that."
"Flipboy, you’re obviously not as bright as I gave you credit for in my mind before all this rhetoric. And, how did I attack? You mentioned the Nazi regime and I stated how ridiculous that was to compare the two. 13"
"Typical FLW. Start personal attacks on someone, then cower like a pony when confronted about it. 13"
"TDawg,""Not as bright"".. that, coming from a full-on Trump supporter, is a compliment.Here's a question to surely blow your gasket. How is Trump not a fascist?"
"ttuaddawg. Just like to add that Seattle is doing just fine in spite of donald and protests. A record number of jobs are offered, housing market continues to improve, innovation and creativity continues to flourish in this liberal utopia. I could name the companies that started in Seattle and went global but I think you can figure who they are. And since I love Canada, my wife being from Canada, I have no problem with their socialistic society, invoking failed South American countries always makes one lose the debate on the pros and cons of socialism.Finally, you keep carping about Biden and his pedophilia actions, not buying it. But donald has a history of perv behavior, that even you cannot defend. Or can you?"
"Why should we support a program that wastes money? Aside from this, the NEA mainly caters to the donor class, who have more than enough funds to support the arts should they wish. I mean these are the same people who keep saying to raise the tax rate on the rich. Oh wait, that would be the earned income rate not the investment rate, thus allowing them to stay as wealthy as usual while punishing small business owners and people who actually make something. Cut it."
"Flipboy, let me let your beloved Washington Post why he’s not a facist:“ In the fascist derby, Trump is a loser. Even Spain’s Francisco Franco and Portugal’s António de Oliveira Salazar might score higher. While there is a strong family resemblance, and with some features an uncanny likeness, Trump doesn’t fit the profile so well on those points where the use of violence is required. Projecting an air of menace at rallies, uttering ambiguous calls for assassinations, tacitly endorsing the roughing-up of protesters, urging the killing of terrorists’ families and whatever else Trump does — while shocking by the standards of American politics — fall far short of the genuinely murderous violence endorsed and unleashed by authentic fascists.”13"
"Regarding golf, it's not so much how often it's played. Rather, it shows how 45 promised something he did not deliver.He chastised Obama's frequent golf playing and swore he would not do such a thing if elected.He lied. Or forgot what he said. Or something.Here's a nice piece on that broken promise and its appearance, from a conservative media outlet, no less.https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-yor…"
"“ Biden and his pedophilia actions, not buying it.“ HardTen, with all due respect, how can you not buy it. There’s many pieces of video evidence of him caressing and fondling little girls hair and faces. Again though, I didn’t say he was a pedophile, but that he definitely is into some odd behavior with little girls. I stated several liberals have pedophilia on their agenda. Don’t you see all this “ageism” and the TED talks where they are pushing pedophilia as a “sexual preference?”Don’t you see all that is happening? Even today, it came out that Facebook used a survey recently asking if grown men should be able to ask 14 year old girls for sexual pictures. Look it up. Seriously. 13"
"Lmao, kitty. That’s what you’re bringing to this? An article about Trump lying about rounds of golf??13"
#849...my reference to Venezuela was in response to a post by Glepaw.
"""Even today, it came out that Facebook used a survey recently...""You know you get those surveys based on your reading and interests, right? Regardless of what Q tells you, there is no agenda in support of that lurid subject."
"TdawgThat piece was written three years ago, long before Trump predictably met the author's fascist checklist. Try again.Here's a more recent reference for you, coming from Fox News no less https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federalist-…"
"“my reference to Venezuela was in response to a post by Glepaw.” - But, you used my quote so you can see your own confusion in the matter. 13"
"“You know you get those surveys based on your reading and interests, right?” - nice try, but I didn’t receive the survey. I read the news article that came out this morning. 13"
"Flip, so one guy called him a facist and you posted the article. Okay. 13"
TdawgYour outdated and ineffective reference was written 3 years before that fascist cancer in the White House metastasized. Now I'm serving you a fresh Trump take down by your very own Fox News and Federalist Society and all you can say is 'Okay'? Weak. Bigly.
"These are just a few of the things DJT has down for this country, this was posted by the Washington Post in December 2019, stating the Top 10 things he has done while being President. I’ve only listed 4.1. He has continued to appoint conservative judges at a record pace. The Senate recently confirmed Trump’s 50th pick for the federal circuit courts of appeal, which have final say over about 60,000 cases a year. In three years, Trump has appointed just five fewer circuit court judges than Obama appointed in eight years. And he has flipped three of these courts from liberal to conservative majorities, giving conservatives the majority in seven out of 13.2. He ordered the operation that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It was a high-risk mission that required U.S. forces to fly hundreds of miles into terrorist-controlled territory. If things had gone horribly wrong, Trump would have been blamed. That risk is why former vice president Joe Biden advised President Barack Obama not to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Trump did not hesitate the way Biden did.3. He delivered the biggest blow to Planned Parenthood in three decades. Thanks to Trump’s Protect Life Rule that prohibits Title X family planning funds from going to any clinic that performs on-site abortions — Planned Parenthood announced this year that it is leaving the Title X program barring a court victory. This is a major pro-life victory and another reason Christian conservatives continue to support him.4. His tariff threats forced Mexico to crack down on illegal immigration. Mexico is for the first time in recent history enforcing its own immigration laws — sending thousands of National Guard forces to its southern border to stop caravans of Central American migrants. Plus, Congress is poised to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement, which would not have been possible without the threat of tariffs."
"Flip, if you haven’t noticed, which is apparent, Fox News doesn’t really support Trump any more and he calls them out repeatedly. I guess your ideas are outdated. You, on the other hand, have basically called Trump supporters Nazis. Remember, that’s half the country. You’re despicable for that. 13Edited: 1:21 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"5. His “maximum pressure” campaign is crippling Iran. Iran’s economy is contracting, inflation is spiraling and the regime has been forced to cut funding for its terrorist proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas, the Iranian military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). And now the Iranian people are engaged in the largest popular uprising since the 1979 revolution.6. His withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty is delivering China and North Korea a strategic setback. The United States is now testing new, previously banned intermediate-range missiles. These weapons will allow us to compete with China’s massive investment in these capabilities, and also provide a fallback in the likely case negotiations with North Korea fail — obviating the need for temporary deployments of U.S. carrier battle groups and allowing us to put North Korea permanently in our crosshairs.7. He stood with the people of Hong Kong. He warned China not to use violence to suppress pro-democracy protests and signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. Hong Kong people marched with American flags and sang our national anthem in gratitude.8. He has got NATO allies to cough up more money for our collective security. Allies have increased defense spending by $130 billion since 2016. And the White House reports almost twice as many allies are meeting their commitment to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense today than before Trump arrived.9. He implemented tighter work requirements for food stamps. With unemployment at historic lows, there is no reason more people should not be earning their success through productive work. The rules apply only to able-bodied, childless adults. When we require people to work for public assistance, we not only help meet their material needs but also help them achieve the dignity and pride that come with being a contributing member of our community. Work is a blessing, not a punishment.10. He continued to deliver for the forgotten Americans. Unemployment is at record lows; this year the number of job openings outnumbered the unemployed workers to fill them by the widest gap ever; wages are rising, and low-wage workers are experiencing the fastest pay increases. Fifty-seven percent of Americans say they are better off financially since Trump took office."
"Link to The Washington Post top ten list?So many people who complain about ""the media"" have such poor understanding of it."
"This was the end of the article belowThere are many other significant achievements that did not make the top 10. Despite an inexcusable 55-day delay, he gave Ukraine the lethal aid that the Obama-Biden administration refused to deliver. He secured the release of additional American citizens held abroad. He launched cyberattacks on Iran, approved a major arms sale to Taiwan, imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Beijing’s oppression of the Uighurs, and refused to make major concessions to North Korea"

"Flip, I’d be willing to bet if we met face to face, without any politics between us, that we’d get along. I say this because I’ve agreed with several of your posts over the last few months. The posts where we weren’t all in this political discussion. I can say that because I try to see all sides. Even though you deny it, I’ve mentioned several times how Trump has been a fool on many things. Heck, I even mentioned several posts ago that I’d be willing to drop Trump and Biden and start with two different candidates. None of you have mentioned Biden’s inadequacies, besides Qdog. See, it can’t be one sided. We admit Trump should shut his mouth on more than several occasions, yet I’ve not seen any of you talk about Biden’s ludicrous agenda and statements.

"""He has continued to appoint conservative judges at a record pace""...yet per the Constitution court appointments are suppose to be apolitical.""Are you serious??? All the actions he's taken and things he's done and said since his Presidency and this is the one you choose to criticize? This is the one thing he is doing right. You might question some individual choices, but he is supposed to choose judges that reflect his own views. You think every other President didn't do the same thing? He would literally be letting down those who voted for him, who supposedly want him to make appointments that reflect both his and their views.We are taking more steps backwards than forward, and judicial appointments will be a part of this for years. But if you want to blame anyone for this, blame those who voted for Trump, not the President himself."

"What's with ""Pa""?...nobody said ""Dad."" Everything was ""Paaa."""
How did I forget The Outlaw Josey Wales . That should be second on my Clint Eastwood list but a friend called and I hurried the post up because it was brew pub time. The Magnificent Seven of course along with The Big Country and Shane but I was only listing Wayne and Eastwood movies. I guess being 70 causes some senior moments.

"I fear this thread may die unless we get it back to politics.A Democratic funded PAC called Sunflower State has been running ads accusing ""Romney style Republicans"" of trying to derail Kris kobacks campaign in favor of the ""swamp creature"" Roger Marshall. They are doing this because they consider Koback beatable as he lost the Governors race two years ago to a Democrat, Laura Kelly. Kansas is a deeply red state.This tactic worked well for Claire Mccaskill in 2012 in Missouri when she won a second term against Todd Akin who won the Republican nomination after she ran ads saying he was too conservative for Missouri. Todd Akin became famous nationally after winning the nomination for going on a St Louis right wing talk show and saying that women could self abort if they were raped so there was no need for abortion in cases of rape or incest.Is this a fair tactic for one party to meddle in another parties business during a primary?"

"vpearl, it doesn't just happen across national boundaries. Domestically, a good player in one of the lower English leagues will often get snapped up by a Premier League team. The team I follow spent many years in a lower league, and lost many good players to the EPL during that time, so I know how frustrating it is.Edited: 1:22 pm, August 01, 2020 "

"And the ""mainstream"" outlets don't do this for the Democrats or in rare instances Republicans that are willing puppets? If the media did their job we'd be talking about the fact Bill Clinton was spotted at Pedo Island per leaked documents, or that some little left wing terrorist threw a bomb at the Federal Building in Portland."
"“ This is going to be the ugliest, smear filled, dirt digging, full of lies 3 months in political history. ” - Agreed, but always remember it’s from both sides. 13"

Trump's corruption is enormous.
"Biden’s brain is enormously forgetful. Perhaps too many inappropriate thoughts of little girls in there?? They say if you rid your brain of filth, you can retain real important stuff. 13Edited: 1:34 pm, August 01, 2020 "
Trump and Jr started that bs. They are scum.

"Lol, at least he remembers something. 13"
"PnS, I bet you rooted for Drago in his fight with Rocky."
"I do love the folks that claim Trump “is your president,” and don’t realize he’s their President as well. It happens more than you think, you know why don’t you?? It’s their weak brains. 13"
"I don't think Biden likes little girls in that way. I think Biden is just a weird guy who frankly is from a completely different era. Remember, this is the guy who used the word ""ne**o"" in one of his speeches in 1973. I actually feel sorry for him. He is being used and will be eventually thrown away like old garbage when his usefulness is up."
I think DTC has contributed more posts than anyone else to this thread and should get the 1000th post.
"While we’re at it, and before I jump in my pool, let’s keep this rolling with some other good news. I don’t have any right now, but certainly someone does. 13"
"I think Siddy should get the magic 1,000."
I hsve good news...Trump will lose.
"“I don't think Biden likes little girls in that way.” - Well PnS, the videos tell a different tale. I do agree that it’s like the Democratic Party found a guy to commit elder abuse against and he easily goes along with it. 13"
"If Trump “looses” as so many like to say, again, I’ll be fine as long as our country doesn’t go to h3ll. 13"
"However, if Biden “looses,” what will y’all do??Lmao, I have several ideas. 13"
"Come gather 'round, peopleWherever you roamAnd admit that the watersAround you have grownAnd accept it that soonYou'll be drenched to the boneIf your time to you is worth savin'And you better start swimmin'Or you'll sink like a stoneFor the times they are a-changin'"
Great tune. It seems like they were talking about these days where the USA is being terrorized by its own ignorant citizens. Good thing we don’t have to deal with these thugs down here. 13

I promised someone earlier in this thread that was upset that it had gone so far off topic that at the time of the 1000th post I would post something on topic. It is a shame that there has been a spike in covid cases in Nevada and I hope things can be brought under control so Vegas can return to what it was before this mess started.
The rough crowd is apparently throwing trash in the hallways at Aria. Check out the Riverside Resort in Laughlin. One of the newer reviews shows a photo with a bunch of trash all over a hallway. It is just sad what is happening right now. Rough crowd indeed.

Give to the United Negro College Fund.And “ Negro” was routinely used as a race designation on various forms then as well.There are certainly some cringe-worthy moments in Biden’s past when it comes to racial issues.Using “ Negro” in a 1973 speech wouldn’t be one of them.Unless there’s some context in the speech that you’re not providing?"

“I'm just checking to see if it will outlive the pandemic.”A handful of people on the thread seem convinced the media will let the pandemic disappear after the election (since it’s apparently just an anti-Trump media creation anyway).I guess we should keep this thread rolling until November just to be sure.

"Speaking of Chelsea, it sucks to see Pulisic go down with an injury. He's been lights out since they started back up again. Question for Jamro and Siddy: Pulisic, greatest player right now? Or greatest player ever?"
My brother in law just got it. His company has shut down for a week. 83 new cases in my county last time I checked. Similar numbers in many upstate NY counties. Plus college is starting back up in a few weeks. So I'd guess we'll be seeing a spike real soon in my neck of the woods.
"#1033, neither.#1034, stay safe x"
"Upstate, yep, definitely another blow for Chelsea with the Pulisic hamstring injury. I think that affected them more than going down to 10 men with the harsh Kovacic second yellow card. It just wasn't their day today. You could see that Pulisic felt his hamstring go but still kept his run going and got his shot away before collapsing in agony. Brave lad. I suspect he might have been the player vpearl was referring to earlier in the thread, but yes, a great player and destined for great things.Edited: 3:44 pm, August 01, 2020 "
I was obviously kidding about the greatest ever silliness. But I am highly encouraged that perhaps he has earned his spot moving forward. I really hope that when Chelsea starts spending again that he doesn't get buried behind some expensive transfer. He's shown he belongs at this level.

Who woulda thought Tiktok might be banned before automatic weapons...
"A record 1165 hospitalized in Nevada yesterday and 333 in intensive care. I wonder how many nurses they'll take with them? As for cases, they're not sure, the count is about 3 weeks behind. UNLV has shut down it's drive-through Covid testing, too hot outside for the staff."
Just follow Trump's lead. What could ever go wrong?
"Two weeks ago, Trump declared that he was unveiling a new unbelievable plan. Where is it? No Mind Don."
"It's funny, Americans as a whole have always been quite protective of their privacy. Until social media came along. Then we gladly handed over everything about ourselves. The US government is banning TikTok simply because only they want the ability to data mine everything there is to know about their citizens."
"I expect the Big Cheeto to announce he's not running within a few weeks. His ""postpone the election"" was one final Hail Mary. When even his own party told him to go screw that was the final nail in the coffin."
"@upstate, then who would be the candidate? Pence? Mitt? Santorum? Don Jr. or Ivanka or Jared as VP?"
"At this point it really has to be Pence. The delegates can vote however they choose, but no other candidate really is ready made to run. It would screw the GOP over even worse than they are now, but Trump couldn't care less about that.I'd expect Jared and Don Jr. to be under indictment soon after. I don't think people quite understand just how much the GOP despises Trump. They are going to turn on him and his family the moment it is politically feasible. They want to destroy them even more harshly than even the Democrats wish to."
"Once the GOP realizes donald has always been a Democrat they will turn on him easily. Oh wait, most of the established republicans already knew that. The credit all goes to McConnel. Oh moscow mitch played it brilliantly. He kept donald around to play the stooge so he could stack up all the courts with conservative judges who will be around for decades. Like I said. Brilliant."
"Mitch and his crew never wanted Trump. They could've gotten their judges anyways, Clinton was never gonna win. Instead they now have to deal with a severely damaged party facing a huge demographic shift over the next decade. And a radicalized left that want to completely transform our economy."
"True. Mitch did not want donald. But since he was stuck with him he made the best of it. And it turned out well considering judges. And the radical left would love to transform the economy, but that will never happen. Biden will play the middle except on some progressive issues to appease the Warren/Sanders crowd, but Wall Street will march on no matter who is in office. Money begets money, Greed begats greed. What worries me the most is how the FED has taken the low road on interest rates. Buy Gold."
"The first confirmed COVID-19 case in South Korea was reported on Jan. 20, just a day before the first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported.South Korea death toll is 300.The US has 157,000 covid19 deaths. Trump says countries are impressed with our testing."

You wouldn’t believe the amount of sex trafficking that occurs, even in this more affluent area. Teenage girls, soccer moms, even younger girls and grandmas disappear on a daily basis throughout Texas. It’s a huge issue across the country, not just here in Texas, but it’s more abundant here because of the proximity to the territory these scum bags operate in.

Doesn't effect me but I have a couple of friends that really need the money,I am eagerly awaiting our next $2400 check in a month or two. I heard the President say, while talking to the press last week, he would like to increase that amount but didn't say how much. An even 4 grand would be great.

Hard TenI wouldn't worry too much about Trump gaining support among people getting checks.

Are y’all going to do something about it? Again, that’s a facetious question because you would have already done so. You’ll await Trumps order to send in the troops and Federal Agents with guns and other weapons you’re opposed to. Hypocrisy at its finest. Have a safe day Seattle and Chicago! Oh, that reminds me...on to find the latest Chicago black on black murder stats from over the weekend. Probably several more black children murdered, you know, because black lives matter!!13"

There is practically nothing that can move Trump to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has said that he has never talked to Putin about the bounties despite talking to him 7 times after the news about bounties.
#1124So are you suggesting what he and his handler Netanyahu are doing re Palestine is right?
"WilliamB-Most of the Trump 38% would be unable to locate Israel on a map, much less explain where and what Palestine even is.More egregious, though, is the fact that their ignorance doesn’t even embarrass them. They will proudly proclaim that they don’t care what happens outside the US. America first, and all that. That’s why they really don’t care about things like Trump being Putin’s lapdog and our abandonment of the Kurds."

"FLW, pointing out that African Americans are murdering themselves, even innocent children, at an alarming rate on a weekly basis is racist??The lack of media coverage regarding it and the lack of outrage by the Black Lives Matter movement regarding it is absurd and hypocritical. How can BLM ignore this violence when their slogan literally means they should matter?You do realize there are many respectable African Americans that are pro Trump, and against the BLM movement, don’t you?I guess all those African Americans that have pointed out the violence in Chicago, before I have, are racist as well according to your logic. Do you remember Obama said he’d take care of all that violence in his adopted home town shortly after he entered office so long ago? I’m sure you don’t. Btw, you labeled me racist in a post several days ago regarding folks terrorizing these liberal cities because I used the term “thugs,” in which I had to school you on the meaning of the word. A thug is: a violent person, especially a criminal, according to the Oxford dictionary. 13"

"@FLWThe virus was clearly in this country since late last year. The media likes to act like it just started spreading like wildfire in March. This is not true. We didn't go from 1 case to tens of thousands of cases in the span of a few weeks. This has been active in the population for months. If no one knew about COVID in March until the end of flu season we would have simply assumed the flu was very virulent this year. When you take away all the wrongfully counted COVID deaths where a person was infected with it but died from a complication this virus has a lot more in common with H2N2 of 1957 than it does the 1918 pandemic. Oh and black Americans do vote for Trump. My wife is bi-racial (white and black) and she voted for him and will vote for him again. She doesn't like his personality, wishes he would stop tweeting, doesn't agree with all of his policies, etc. but realizes how horrible Hillary and Biden are and how the Democrat Party is basically insane now. She used to be a Democrat btw, is now and Independent. Refuses to be a Republican."

Imho I don't think anyone should be accused of being racist simply for making that point."
"^^^meant to say the majority of young black males killed, not deaths."
"We have all been locked in, laid off etc. The sheer amount of deaths is beyond comprehension & it's natural to comment but I for one am sick of the moaners, & the whingers who use the pandemic as an excuse just to attack their political opponents.Who in the world has any experience of dealing with a 21st century pandemic of this magnitude? Who has experienced experts to consult with? Who is truly doing great?If the political leader you hate is not doing well, ask yourself who in your country would have done better?

It’s so hypocritical though, the Democrats stance...always talking about equality and peace and love (what they say anyway), yet always so quick to name call, degrade and label everyone that doesn’t agree with them as racist.

Not necessarily that it’s “lose lose,” but that we don’t have great choices. Again, a lot of you feel that way about Biden, and for good reason, yet their hate for Trump trumps the idiocy of Biden in their heads.

Never worth repeating in my opinion!

"NYC has a death rate twice that of the rest of NY, three times that of many surrounding states, and about eight times higher than that of the US in general.

Total long-term care deaths rose to 3,155 on Monday, representing about 42% of the state’s 7,526 fatalities overall, in line with the national trend.

He said the U.S. is in “very good shape” while touting economic indicators.Trump also reiterated his push for schools to reopen, saying inaccurately that children are “almost immune” to the virus but that “the teachers are a different story.” He recommended that older teachers not return to work until the pandemic passes"

"BYEDON 2020I will answer PB question, which should be simple..people are/should be tested even if asymptomatic so as not to spread the virus to friends and family, particularly if any have conditions that might make matters worse..."
"The key to containment is vigorous contact tracing and testing. You get a newly infected person? Get in and test everyone they were in contact with. End the chain of infection right there. We are not doing that, at all. We wait and hope. It's not working.We also need random testing at all large workplaces and schools. There are about 40,000 casinos workers right now. We need 4000 tests a week of them. Find the virus as soon as possible. We are not doing that either.Even more pressing than amount of tests is the time it takes to process them. In many places it takes a week or more. It makes contact tracing almost useless. The virus has spread already, exponentially even. This strikes home to me. My brother in law works at a company that had a case. By the time they found out, not only did 10 get it, including my brother in law, but it spread again. My sister is now sick and my 79 year old father is in isolation awaiting his test result. We are terrified.Our testing system is a disgrace."

So, you could be tested this morning and negative and get exposed and get it this afternoon.You just can't test people enough to try to control anything that way.

And that number is again trending down. Less than the number in NY state alone in April. In fact almost every other state's entire outbreak (number of daily infections and number of daily deaths) fall under the FLAT portion of the curve Cuomo brought to you in NY State. In your state there are still 600/700 new daily cases and 10-25 daily deaths yet you find the time to come on TA and criticize Nevada for exceeding those numbers 20 times since June 1st?!Cuomo killed all of the nursing home residents in NY and the rest of the country caught a bad flu.

"Just the facts as presented..States ranked by violence 17. Texas• Violent crime rate: 410.9 per 100,000 people• Total 2018 murders: 1,322 (2nd highest)• Imprisonment rate: 746 adults per 100,000 (5th highest)• Poverty rate: 14.9% (11th highest)• Most dangerous city: BellmeadAlong with California, Texas is one of only two states in which there were more than 100,000 violent crimes committed in 2018. Adjusted for population, Texas's violent crime rate stands at 410.9 per 100,000 people, slightly higher than the national rate of 380.6 per 100,000.Texas has one of the highest imprisonment rates in the country. There are 746 adults incarcerated in state and federal prisons in Texas for every 100,000 people, more than in all but four other states.Illinois is two spots better, as shown 19. Illinois• Violent crime rate: 404.1 per 100,000 people• Total 2018 murders: 884 (4th highest)• Imprisonment rate: 418 adults per 100,000 (18th lowest)• Poverty rate: 12.1% (22nd lowest)• Most dangerous city: DanvilleIllinois is one of the 19 states where the violent crime rate exceeds 400 incidents per 100,000 people. As is typically the case, crime in the state is concentrated in urban areas. In Chicago, the most populous city in Illinois, 27,357 violent crimes were committed in 2018, more than half the total number of crimes reported in the state that year.Still, after adjusting for population Chicago does not rank as the most dangerous city in the state – that distinction goes to Danville. There were 1,791.5 reported incidents of rape, robbery, homicide, and aggravated assault for every 100,000 people in Danville in 2018, well above Chicago's violent crime rate of 1,006.1 per 100,000."

"I'm curious about this whole ""Obama pledges to end gun violence in Chicago when he becomes President."" thing you're pushing.1. He never made any such campaign pledge.2. In fact the surge in violence hadn't even started yet. It occurred after he took office.3. It's not his job anyways. He didn't try and enact comprehensive gun control measures, most of which the GOP blocked of course.But go on, right wing fever dreams are fascinating to see."

"Well, well. Biden tells a group of reporters that he was top in his class in law school, was the only one in his class to have a full scholarship and graduated with three degrees. Only to be called out on it that he only had only one degree, was at the bottom of his class (76th of 85 students) and only had a half-scholarship. When called out by Newsweek, he conceded that they were right and his memory failed him. This was in the 1980’s for crying out loud. So he’s a conceited liar whose memory was failing him over 30 years ago??Sounds like a great leader!13"
I have never said that Biden is a great candidate. We have an age limit as to how old a candidate has to be to run for president. Maybe we need an upper limit also. 65 might be good. Like many other people I don't support Biden I oppose Trump. The coming election is a referendum on Trump having little to do with the virtues of Joe Biden.

"GlepawI have said before that this election is not about Biden, it is a referendum on Trump. I have only seen this country as divided as it is now in the 1960s, era of The Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam. I was a teenager then and remember the time well. I never bought that drain the swamp stuff and believe politicians have done a fair job of running this Country for well over 200 years. I want to get our Country to back normal. Though both candiidates are way past their prime Biden has the best shot at healing the Nation. Just my opinion."

"I don't think Biden should consent to debate Trump unless they hold the debate in a small studio with only Trump, Biden, the moderator and tv crew in the room. Trump feeds off crowds and would be like a deflated balloon in such an environment. In these covid times it's the proper thing to do and would give Biden an edge.Just some thoughts while I watch the Royals finally win a game."
Royals are on fire tonight
"The Royals might stink, but Whit Merrifield is 1 of my favorite players to watch"
"Are You watching the game? Whit hit a 2 run homer earlier in the game and just now since I started this post ran from first to score on a Salvy double. Salvy just scored. Score, Royals 11, Cubs 0. better stop now or this post will end up a play by play."
"If I am Biden , I agree to a debate , if Trump releases his tax returns...will prove once and for all, he has ripped off the system...and has donated next to zero to everything he says he had"
He is the biggest fraud ever to occupy the WH
"2salty: “Tdawg - I was one who called you out as racist - hundreds of posts ago. You called people, real people coming across our border trying desperately for a better life - your words as I remember were: “filthy animals”. Yup - still sounds racist to me.”And, you conveniently left out my response back to you that I was referring to the sex traffickers that terrorize my area, along with all of Texas and surrounding areas, not to mention the rest of the United States. Not sure why you’d bring that up again when I explained to you that thousands of people, both male and female, and of all ages and races have been kidnapped and sold into sex trafficking. Unfortunately, organ harvesting is another horrible consequence of being taken for some. Then, they’re eventually murdered. The majority of this activity funnels through Mexico and South America (through Mexico of course)...illegally. “You called people, real people coming across our border trying desperately for a better life...” - as explained above, I wasn’t referring to those people, I was referring to the deplorables that commit those crimes, along with many other crimes, that are illegally crossing our border. 13"

"Trumps profound thoughts on Religion. ""No Religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God."" As Bugs Bunny would say ""what a maroon.""I thought I would get this thread rolling early this morning."
"Trump is a businessman, not a pastor. He doesn't have practiced answers about religious questions, nor should he be expected to, But that doesn't mean he's irreligious. I agree with this statement his supporters have made about his religion. I won’t judge him on that and God will be the judge of him."
Glepaw so is Trump immoral or amoral ?
"I think he is both, immoral in his personal behavior, amoral in his belief system."
I have always felt You can judge the morality of actions but not of people. What seems immoral to you might not be immoral to others.I
"It's pretty funny when the jesus freaks talk about how God is the only one to judge.When the reason they're willing to totally ignore what an amoral grifting sleazebag Trump is, is because of the judges he's appointing."
So when he bragged about grabbing the vaginas of young ladies did you find that immoral or moral ?

"Woody Guthrie wrote great song in the 1930s, ""So Long It's Been Good To Know You.""The last verse went something like this.The telephone rang and it jumped off the wallThat was the preacher a makin' his callHe said kind friend this may the endTo have your last chance for salvation of sin The church it was jammed and the church it was packedThat dusty old dust storm it blowed so blackPreacher could not read a word of his textSo he folded his specs and took up collection saidSo long it's been good to know youSo long it's been good to know youSo long it's been good to know youThis dusty old dust storms a gittin' my homeAnd I gotta be drifting' along.This song illustrates that the Donald might make a good preacher."
I love how radical Xtians can ignore Trump's violations of several of the 10 Commandments yet will dig through obscure passages to condemn swaths of society for their orientation or exercising a personal decision over their own body.
Glepaw....are you listening ?
"When Trump proclaimed yesterday that Biden would hurt or even eliminate God if elected, Biden should have given Trump that extra debate he wants and demand it be a debate on the Bible and religion and happen this weekend. I think we all would be better served if the debates had limiting subjects.

Mark Cuban would be a great president. Maybe down the road he’ll run

"@VPearAt home tests that cost around $1 are being worked on as we speak. The big labs are working on ""batching"" which will allow for greater testing capacity as well as less use of reagents and other supplies. Things like this take time.

"DeWine tested negative with the PCR test 19 hours after testing positive qith the rapid test administered by POTUS advance team. Axcurate testing is a crapshoot still in the greatest nation on the planet. How can that be?Edited: 12:04 pm, August 07, 2020 "
“ IS it me or does anyone else find it strange that donald spends almost no time with his son Barron”Nothing surprises me about Trump. It’s always been an almost 100% rule that the press leaves the President’s children alone . No stalking for photos or trying to get “ dirt” on them or whatever.But when Obama was in office you did hear about activities after they took place .He and Mrs. Obama went to the kids school events. Athletic competitions. Even mentions of him taking the girls out for ice cream or to the theater. But now? Nada. Maybe it’s happening and just not being reported. But I doubt it.
"""DeWine tested negative with the PCR test 19 hours after testing positive qith the rapid test administered by POTUS advance team""Works both ways. You can also get a false negative with the rapid test. It's only a matter of time when someone tests negative and gets up close and personal with trump."

"A controversial case that’s been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four Black teenagers and one Latino teenager — the “Central Park Five” — were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding, “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” The teens’ convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they’re guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary."

Twenty-eight of the deaths were reported in Clark County in the past 24 hours.Data released Saturday notes 886 new COVID-19 cases in Nevada and 749 in Clark County in the last day. Statewide, 12,133 tests were reported on Friday — possibly including some tests reported from a backlog as the state and a vendor continue working on reporting.In Clark County, new hospitalizations have surged over the past few days, with 68 new hospitalizations reported today, and nearly 400 new hospitalizations this week. The state’s total number of hospitalized patients reported today dropped by 59.Over the course of the past four to five weeks, recent COVID-19 data shows Nevada is continuing to set records for cases, testing, hospitalizations, ICU patients and ventilator usage"

"Again, Please provide any info on a visitor of Las Vegas that has died from the Chinese Magic Virus. Now for it to be a confirmed death, the visitor would have had been in quarantine for 2 weeks prior to visiting Vegas and tested negative for the Chinese Magic Virus the day before they went. The person would have had to have traveled in a vehicle by themselves and not stopped prior to arriving at their Vegas destination. Then upon return to their home location, they would have had been quarantined for 2 weeks to confirm they obtained the Chinese Magic Virus in Vegas. Then they would have to die.Once this can be confirm, let me know."

I heard the best news since this whole covid mess started if it's true but i am extremely skeptical. The Russians have developed a vaccine that is ready to be released to the public. Maybe in the next few months as the Russian population is vaccinated we will see if the good news is real. I personally would avoid this vaccine until it is proven safe and effective.

"underpar and Glepaw, thank you for your kind words. You’d think, regardless of political affiliation, any American would be outraged by this and the thousands of other cases of sex trafficking that occur in our country on a daily basis.

I don't think that mistakenly believing that the Chinese started WWII when it was actually Richard Nixon and his band of burglars disqualifies you from being president.

Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris for VP. Can you imagine that stumblebum Pence trying to debate her?First African and Asian American woman to be chosen by a major party for VP.
"The key is Biden stated all along he’d have a woman of color as his VP candidate. How is excluding ANY race from your choices not racist? If he stated he’d only have a white woman as his VP candidate, he’d be blasted for being racist, and it would be true. But, it doesn’t work the other way around??I’d love someone to explain that. 13"
"1811 dawg wrote ""You think regardless of political affiliation Americans would be outraged by cases of sex trafficking""Heard potus extending ""well wishes"" to one arrested for her role in an international child sex ring. Dawg did potus do wrong? Or do you approve and extend your best wishes as well? I'll take your silence as complicity."
DawgDo you know the difference between your welcome and you're welcome? Please enlighten those who don't know.
What do you want to bet the birthers will raise their ugly heads to claim that the future Vice President was born in Jamaica or India.
I can sure imagine Biden trying to debate Trump.... LOL
"1824 dawgI'll explain it. Fake news, he never said that.Please provide your source. He said he would appoint a black woman to supreme court. Facts don't mean much to you, do they?Just like the first release from potus campaign on her selection, with a lie in the first sentence."
"@VpearlkcUm Kamala isn't African. She is Jamaican and Indian. Ironically, when she was sworn in as Senator, she did so as the first Indian American. I'm guessing she'll somehow completely forget about that and won't correct anyone when they say ""African American"" over and over.As for taking on Pence, well this is a woman who couldn't get the Nom despite being a black, woman from CA with massive donations, and who got taken out by Tusli Gabbard in less than 5 minutes. Oh and her campaign is already scrubbing her wikipedia page. Bao Nguyen, who has been involved with both the Harris and Biden campaigns was identified as the culprit removing her scandals.Edited: 5:44 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"dawg, positive discrimination does on the face of it seem to be unfair. After all, if you're positively discriminating in favour of a particular race or gender for example, you must by definition be negatively discriminating against those not of that particular race or gender, right?However, when certain professions or roles are seriously under represented by certain races or genders (such that they are totally out of whack with the race or gender make up of the local populus) one has to question whether there are genuinely equal opportunities for all in respect of those roles/professions. In the short term positive discrimination is seen as a way of addressing any lack in that respect, but the long term solution is to create genuine equal opportunities for all, so that positive discrimination shouldn't be necessary. In this particular case though, I have no doubt that Ms. Harris is as well qualified for the role as others who were in the running anyway."
@TravelerKamala is bi-racial. Indians don't identify as black. Jamaicans do. She isn't African American but she will be more than happy to let people think she is.
"potus just said about vp choice ""she did poorly in primaries, many expected her to do well, she did VERY poorly""Does he not know she ended her campaign in December 2019 before any caucus or primary???Aside from the par number of every hole at each of his golf course and the offerings from a Mc Donald's, does he know anything?"

The Indian vote will go primarily to Trump, it doesn't benefit her to pander to that crowd. But she will try to get as many black Americans to forget all the crap Biden has said and done."

Kamala Harris self identifies as an African American because her father is an immigrant from Jamaica of African descent. If she chose to she could identify as an Asian American because her mother is an immigrant from India. The only native Jamaicans are the Arawaks who were living there when Columbus made shore at Discovery Bay. It seems simple to me.
"We are all descendants of Africa. Unless you were personally born in Africa or had citizenship at the time of your birth from an African country, you aren't African American. Only exception would be for someone who is dual citizen. That would be like saying I am a Polish American. I'm not. While I have ancestry there, neither my parents or grandparents had citizenship.Edited: 7:18 pm, August 11, 2020 "

Indians in India sure like Trump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esHiEKhecdcI'd guess many of those who say Democrat do so to not be called racist. But we'll see.
Jews in Israel seem to like Trump. Jews in USA not so much. Jews in USA can vote.Indian Americans also can vote and Kamala Harris is one of them.

"jamro, I agree with your point in your second paragraph, just as you agreed with my point in your first paragraph. 13"
Is it possible that Trump will dump Pence and put Nikki Haley on the ballot in 2020 to counter Biden's choice of Kamala Harris?
"Remember when Presidents did not push far fetched conspiracies…yeah, me too! I thought things could not get any worse in the realm of politics, I sure was wrong."
"In April 2019, senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) said she believed the women who said they felt uncomfortable after being touched by former Vice President and presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden.Senator Harris said last year at one of her campaign events that she believed accusers of Joe Biden, according to a report by The Hill.“I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” said Harris at an April 2019 event in Nevada.Several women had come forward accusing Biden of touching them inappropriately and making them feel uncomfortable.On Tuesday, Biden, who is now the presumptive 2020 Democrat nominee, selected Senator Harris to be his Vice President in the upcoming November election.At the time, former Nevada state lawmaker Lucy Flores — a Democrat — made the first accusation in an essay in New York Magazine‘s The Cut. Flores’ accusation was followed by Amy Lappos, who told the Hartford Courant that Biden touched her inappropriately at a 2009 event in Connecticut.The next day, two additional women — Caitlyn Caruso and D. J. Hill — came forward and shared their unwanted experiences with the former Vice President with The New York Times.In response to Flores’s accusation, Biden said that he has “offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort.”“And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,” insisted the former Vice President. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully.”Harris’s remarks in April 2019 did not appear to be in reference to Biden’s most notable accuser, Tara Reade, who had come forward earlier this year alleging that Biden has sexually assaulted her in 1993 in a Capitol Hill office building when she was a staff assistant in his Senate office."
"#1851,I had assumed that he would grab Susan Rice, as she is now a “free agent... “Hunt"
"It was disappointing to see the lack of appropriate distancing, and lack of masking, on the news clips I saw of Harris and the boys."

"The Donald insinuated that Ted Cruz's father was in on the killing of JFK during the 2016 campaign. After Trump secured the nomination all was forgiven. That's just the way politics works, on both sides.Trump supporters forget one thing.

"Fox News didn't pick up the story until yesterday, two days after the killing. The local news started reporting the story on Monday. I did notice that the British press is on the story. Murder is so common in the USA that it takes a mass or celebrity involved killing to get a lot of coverage."

"1866 - you don’t have to wonder “why not” anymore. Remember, only black lives matter now. That’s what they’re saying, and that’s what the media is portraying. So a black man killing an innocent 5 year old white child doesn’t fit the narrative as the headline of the story suggests. It doesn’t matter that the leader of the BLM movement told the whole country on CNN that they would burn the country down and start over if needed. Also, don’t forget the media is very liberal. 13Edited: 9:08 am, August 12, 2020 "
"Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said in a newly surfaced video from 2015 that she and her fellow organizers are “trained Marxists” – making clear their movement’s ideological foundation, according to a report.Cullors, 36, was the protégé of Eric Mann, former agitator of the Weather Underground domestic terror organization, and spent years absorbing the Marxist-Leninist ideology that shaped her worldview, Breitbart News reported.“The first thing, I think, is that we actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers,” she said, referring to BLM co-founder Alicia Garza.“We are trained Marxists. We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories. And I think that what we really tried to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk,” Cullors added in the interview with Jared Ball of The Real News Network.While promoting her book “When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir” in 2018, Cullors described her introduction to and support for Marxist ideology.She described to Democracy Now! how she became a trained organizer with the Labor/Community Strategy Center, which she called her “first political home” under the mentorship of Mann, its director, Breitbart reported.The center, which describes its philosophy as “an urban experiment,” uses grassroots organization to “focus on Black and Latino communities with deep historical ties to the long history of anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, pro-communist resistance to the US empire,” according to the outlet.It also expresses its appreciation for the work of the US Communist Party, “especially Black communists,” as well as its support for “the great work of the Black Panther Party, the American Indian Movement, Young Lords, Brown Berets, and the great revolutionary rainbow experiments of the 1970s,” Breitbart reported.https:/…And let's not forget the gem one of the heads of BLM said the other day re the Chicago loot and scoot:Black Lives Matter members in Chicago held a rally on Monday to support the more than 100 arrested last night following widespread looting and rioting that caused at least $60 million in property damage and saw 13 police officers injured, according to a report.The rally was organized by Black Lives Matter Chicago and was held at a police station in the South Loop where organizers say individuals are currently being held in custody. At least one organizer called the looting tantamount to ""reparations.""“I don’t care if someone decides to loot a Gucci or a Macy’s or a Nike store, because that makes sure that person eats,” said Ariel Atkins, a BLM organizer, according to NBC Chicago. “That makes sure that person has clothes.”“That is reparations,” Atkins continued. “Anything they wanted to take, they can take it because these businesses have insurance.”The unrest was prompted by a social media post urging people to converge on Chicago’s business district after police shot a man on the South Side around 2:30 p.m. Sunday.https:/…"

"Yes, Bannon wanted to destroy the corrupt state, he is very much anti-communist."
"And Kitty, that's a 3 year old article from before Bannon and Trump went their non-amicable ways."

"Interesting that after the last 3 years or so of hearing that white old men are bad and law enforcement is evil, the Demoncats put an old white guy and a law enforcement agent on their ticket.""Meet the new boss, same as the old boss""."
"Cable news pundits claimed on Tuesday night that Kamala Harris could help to motivate young voters, but a speech from 2014 may prove to make that objective more difficult.During a speech to the Ford Foundation, the then-California Attorney General used young people as a punchline, saying they are “stupid” and that’s why they have to live with resident assistants in dormitories.Harris was talking about drug offenders in the criminal justice system during her time as the San Francisco District Attorney and said, “What’s the other thing we know about this population? And it’s a specific phase of life. And remember, age is more than a chronological fact. What else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid.”The audience burst into laughter. The camera cut to one woman, though, who didn’t appear amused.“That is why we put them in dormitories, and they have a resident assistant,” Harris continued.“They make really bad decisions.”During a Tuesday appearance on MSNBC, Dr. Jason Johnson said, Harris’s “challenge going forward, what the Democratic Party needs, they need somebody who’s going to make young people enthusiastic.”“That is not necessarily and area of strength for Sen. Harris, but it something she can dedicate her time to doing,” he said.Johnson said that will be necessary because Harris is capable of “cracking a smile and making a joke.”"
"BLM, the organization, is great at branding.Of course black lives matter, just as much as those of any race. But that isn't the point. The point of the name is that either you say Black Lives Matter or are considered a racist. If you say ""black lives matter"" you are really saying ""Black Lives Matter"" and thus giving support to their group. For most people this is a no win scenario, so they go along with what the group says because they are afraid. It's like ""I don't wear the mask for me, I do it for you"". So either you wear the mask like a good drone or you don't and you are evil and hate everyone. So basically for most people it is a no win scenario. You have to move past caring what the opinion of others is and focus on doing what is actually right vs what others tell you is."

This is another reason why Vegas will not be up and running fully just because of such nonsense."
"siddypuss I am not trying to get in any argument with you, but until you understand that ""BLM"" or ""Black Lives Matter"" has absolutely nothing to black people in our country, you will not realize it's all a big con job being pulled on the somewhat less intelligent people in our country. It's about nothing more than tearing down our infrastructure and government and allowing them to push people around and make lots of moneySo, let's not really argue about whether black lives matter or not. Of course they matter and so do all others. But that has absolutely nothing with what is going on in the USA these days."
"This may help, probably not though.I'm a Liverpool fan and in 1989 ninety six of our fans died at a football match due to getting crushed. From that day on there has been a 'Justice for the 96' campaign.

Yes everybody deserves justice but this campaign was about 96 lives lost and not everybody. Yes all lives do matter, but at this point in time it's about the rights of black people who are being treated differently!"
"Well, no it's really not. But they love that you believe that terrorism, looting, shooting, fires, and and all of the personal property destroyed is because of that. You are the person they are looking for because they think that you believe it's OK for them to do that."

"@FloydDepends on the situation, but by and large, I agree, it is white leftists, specifically anarco-communist groups like ANTIFA that are causing the vast majority of problems right now. Chicago is an aberration. The goal of ANTIFA and these other white people who dress like communist ninjas is to start a class war disguised as a race war. I was born in Chicago.
