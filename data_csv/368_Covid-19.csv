Local family health professionals tell me that Mexican government Covid-19 reports are being downplayed. Stay safe.
"Not surprised. We have people returning to Canada from Mexico with Covid. One in BC and one in Alberta, and that's all that I know of, there maybe more."
"It does make one wonder, as does that the expat who told me on the 09th there were four confirmed cases in Mazatlan is a "" Blue Shirt Volunteer"".But what do I know?"
Our dear AMLO and his gov have no idea what they're doing about covid-19. I'd get out of here asap if I was on vacation.
"Is there even testing going on ?With the symptoms mimicking the flu do people there even know to self isolate ?Are test kits even available ?No cases reported in Mazatlan , how do they know if anyone is sick there if they aren’t testing for it , with the amount of visitors to the area there must be more than zero cases ?"
I had to cancel my mazatlan trip due to covid 19 travel advisories. I'm very disappointed but hope I can get there soon
Bummer oc64Edmonton. Although at this point it's probably a wise decision. How Semana Santa plays out here and on the other coastal towns should provide a clear picture on how Mexico is affected/infected.
"Would love to know WHO is the"" Blue Shirt Volunteer"". who told you that. Since my wife works at a hospital we have a bit of (Sort of) first hand knowledge. There are currently TWO patients in quarantine at that hospital with SUSPECTED Corona Virus. Both just flew in to Mazatlan. They have not yet been conformed. results won't even be back from the lab until Mon. or Tues."
"Roger--I talked to that volunteer and cleared it up. She said she ""heard it from someone else..."" She will not be repeating it."
"Thanks for the info.What day did they fly in, if you know? Also, what airline?"
"Folks, stay home and/or return to your country of residence. Viruses don't take vacations."
"Couldn't agree more: This is not the time to be encouraging people to visit Mazatlan and/or downplaying the risks of traveling here.All due respect to the DE's and their contributions, of course.We just cancelled a 28 MAR trip to TX to be with our beloved children/grandkids - We love them, but why risk the exposure?Edited: 5:57 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I should add exposure to DW & I, and subsequent transmission to our loved ones if DW & I are just carrying it after being in contact with someone who is infected."

"I SUSPECT but have had NO official word yet, that all cruises to Mazatlan are cancelled. Not because Mazatlan is a 'hot spot'. But because the cruise lines are simply not doing ANY sailings to or from the US.I still have no word on results from the virus tests for the two cases in quarantine in the hospital right now. I have no problem with cruise lines canceling their trips here or anywhere else under these circumstances. Would I feel safe traveling to Mazatlan right now? Yea, if I didn't have to get on a ship or a plane. I am DRIVING to the V.A. hospital next weekend. I HOPE.My son is here now on his first visit back to Mazatlan in 18 years. (We have visited before in the U.S, but he has not been HERE for many years.) He rode his big motorcycle down Baja and came over on the ferry. It remains to be seen if he can return that way though. We are both afraid tRump will just use this as another excuse to close the border!For now, stay home, stay safe, avoid crowds ANYWHERE you go back home."
When AMLO declares national emergency I wonder if it will look like martial law and how soon that will happen.
"Cdn borders now closed to most non-Cdn citizens. If you're a Cdn returning to Canada with symptoms, you'll be quarantined before being re-admitted."
"Correction re post 16: US residents can still enter Canada, at least for the time being"
"As of this morning the CDC #s are; 53 cases in all of Mexico up from 26 4 days ago but the same as yesterday. Wa State #s are up 150 cases & 6 deaths since yesterday but with extensive testing since it is one of the epicenters in the U S I would have thought it would have doubled.  Gonna have to watch & ride this one out who knows where it's gonna end up. Stay calm, wash your hands frequently, & stay away from crowds. Safe travels Life is good"
I heard from my travel agent this morning that all cruise ships at sea will take the nearest route to their origin or port city of disembarkation and there will be no future sailings.
Covid 19 Mexico cases for March 17 is reported at 82https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html

"WestJet announced today that they have CANCELLED ALL International Flights as of Sunday, March 22."
US residents can enter Canada but they have to self-quarantine for 14 days.
Any word on the two Mazatlan quarantines yet? Seems like four or five days should be long enough for test results: Donald's took less than 24 hours.

Noroeste and El Sol de Mazatlan online newspapers have some government filtered daily news. Mexico hasn't updated Corvid-19 information to International sites today yet. https://www.noroeste.com.mx/https://www.elsoldemazatlan.com.mx/local/
"Of the two suspected cases I am aware of The results for one came back negative and I don't know why the other result has not come back. The staff in the hospital are treating that case as if it will be positive. Which is EXACTLY what they should be doing.(Do you really believe tRump was actually tested? I have seen articles, all supposedly from 'White House sources' saying he was, he wasn't, he was going to be tested, he was not going to be tested. And yea, the one report that said HIS results magically came back in less that 24 hrs. negative. This is also from the doctor who said he 'sleeps less than I do and is in better health than I am.' Have you SEEN that doctor? Have you SEEN tRump? Which looks healthier to you? There is NOTHING that comes from the White House that I believe any more. Haven't for the last 3 years.)"
"As fast as this virus spreads I have no doubt if there is one positive case, confirmed or not, there are many cases. I heard on NPR today that some cases where the patient tested positive 12-14 days ago, were ill and recovered no longer tested positive. Frankly this is the only good news I've heard in weeks pertaining to the pandemic."
The SECOND case came back negative as well.
"Thanks FR - As usual, a fount of info!"
"DW just stopped at Looney Bean for takeout, was told takeout was all they were doing, no dining in - And on a limited menu that didn't include their famous beef empanadas.Does anyone know whether restaurants doing takeout only, as we've seen in the US, will be the trend here?Edited: 7:47 pm, March 21, 2020 "
There hasn't been a decision levied on them yet!
Thanks M!So discontinuing table service is just the Restaurant Owner's Option now?
"I stopped by F.I.S.H. last evening and there were no customers there at 7 PM. I talked to the owner who told me that she is getting zero tourists and some Mexicans. Since Canada called theirs home, there are nearly none her. She said that she will probably volunteer closing next week. I also heard from a waiter that Friends would close Monday."
"Here in Atlanta metro area. restaurants are pretty empty. Larger restaurants like outback, Longhorn etc. may be open with few customers Smaller mom/pops are pen with few customers. We were doing take-out pickup and were surprised to find patrons ( very few) seated as usual, There seems to be an ""unwritten' rule. Small, stay open, Large close, probably by corp. HQ orders . When asked the small shop owners will say. ""yeah. we are open, but Sunday I'm considering going take-out only""Our local mall is 100% closed. Even to mall walkers.The 10 lane interstate s around Atlanta mainly clear sailing.In general people are observing 6 foot distance recommendations. Still no TP in markets or Costco, Sam's BJs. Eggs, milk, bread seem to be back.Gyms, polls, kids playgrounds, even some dog parks Closed.Boredom reigns.Thinks will get better.borrowing a quote from @squeedink. Life is good.."
DW just heard Angelina's is closing to protect her older customers from exposure.
"My oldest son drove his motorcycle up Baja last week, crossing at Mexicali then went into San Diego on Interstate 8 and up the 5 freeway to Orange County. Friday at rush hour. He said you would see more traffic on a Sunday at 4 a.m. !"
"Your point is well taken Roger, but 2 years ago I drove from SD to LA at 4 AM and the traffic was bumper to bumper until we got to the middle of LA. :-)Edited: 10:47 am, March 23, 2020 "
"DW spoke with a shop keeper she knows, was told a lot of the usual Semana Santa visitors might stay home this year.Has anyone heard anything on that?"

This may be helpful (And reassuring) to those of us who are really trying to 'Self Isolate'. I have been wondering how 'safe' takeout orders would be in these time. Here is one answer: https://www.yahoo.com/news/even-restaurant-w…
"FR: I don't have much Spanish, but it appears ""El Secretario de Salud del Estado de Sinaloa"" said there's one confirmed case in Mazatlan. Please comment, as I know you access ""Feet On The Ground"" here.https://www.debate.com.mx/mazatlan/Se-regist…"
"ferd62, open Spanish page, put cursor somewhere on page and right click mouse, look for line 'Translate to English'.Article says there is 1 confirmed case in Los Mochis, 5 cases in Culiacan and 1 in Mazatlan. For perspective that is about how many cases there were in all of Italy just over a month ago."
This page of Noroeste Maz gives higher numbers and may be more accurate.https://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones/vi…
"An expat friend of ours here was advised by his Maz doctor to return to the US because ""They have a much greater supply of ventilators"" and equipment to deal with you if you contract the virus. He and his wife are 80+ and in very good health.But some US hospitals may have to triage based on likelihood of survival...so if you decide to return to the USA, the hospitals there will be better equipped to treat you...but they might just decide to make you comfortable until you die.Truly a WTF moment.https:/…https://www.npr.org/2020/03/21/819645036/u-s…"
"Kudos to that doctor it's excellent advice. For many expats (and there are many throughout Mexico) going back to the US presents a problem. Some no longer have homes there and even limited or no family. Many are living on very low fixed income and at best 'might' have Medicare part A. There's also the current issue of getting out of Mexico by air. But again I do agree with the advice.I'm really not surprised by the prioritization of care in the hospitals/care facilities. Any of us that have been following what's going on in the US knows that resources are way short. Things like 1 ventilator shared with 4 patients, ships for hospitals, mask shortages. Now imagine how things will be in IMSS."

Ferd62 most medical predictions are that 80% of world population will be infected by Covid-19 by year end so might be helpful to think of where you want to be when you do get it. Recently updated our wills.
Dang dude that's leaning a little too far to the macabre. ☻
"""Mar 14, 2020, 10:45 AMMy daughter, a director of a child development center in Bremerton, WA called yesterday and advised us to remain in Mazatlan. I agree with her as we're safer in Mazatlan""Mazexp: You still good with that?""No, after talking with Dr. Barrazza the foreign liason for Sharp Hosp, he says that he is sure there are more cases in Mazatlan that has been reported, and the hospitals in Mazatlan are not as well equipped as in the states for mass numbers, so he recommended I go home. I changed my Alaska air ticket to April 4, they cut down on flights and notified me that I would have a day layover in LA. I changed my flight to April first with no layover. My neighbor is having my home in Washington cleaned Monday and he is doing two weeks of grocery shopping for e and put it away, taking the same precautions as he does for his own grocery shopping. And yeah, it's basically making the best choice under the circumstances."
"You have a great neighbor up in Washington. It is very thoughtful and kind of him to help out with a safe return for y'all.Stay safe, Mr. and Mrs. Mazexp!"
"Flyght: You don't mean 80% in the US, do you? That'd be about 250M cases and around 2.5M deaths at 1% attrition. I did see a stat wherein up to 80% was predicted in the UK, and another predicting around 60% in the world.""I would say between 100 and 200,000...deaths...we're going to have millions of cases.""

"Mazexp: Thanks, and be safe."
"Ferd62 looks like you have a handle on the statistics, have you decided to stay in Mexico or return to the US, either way best of health to you."
I just learned from a Mexican National that Mexico has gone into the same sort of coronavirus stay-at-home edict as that of the USA.
"Right as usual, and a Good Thing!"
I seldom read wiki's but this one has some good information about Covid-19 in Mexico up until yesterday March 30th;https:/…2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Mexico
"Jibes with what I've been reading, hoping to hear more from the ""Famous Feet on the Ground""."
"In laws tell me that basic food prices have been increasing substantially, doesn't bode well for moms trying to keep kids fed nor for the value of the peso."
We got 19.10 at an ATM when we arrived in October and 23.33 (22% more) just a few minutes ago. Will let you know about prices at Mega.
FR: You there?
Something to consider is length of quarantine; what one might need for several months isolation and what vital items may become scarce.
"""FR: You there?"" Of course."
"a couple weeks back, i advised my good friends in Mazatlan to buy the staples. beans, rice, flour, can goods, water etc. , toilet paper and lysol wipes. All the things they sold out of here first. still can't find tp or wipes,"

"SR: Thanks for your concern.As with FR, I'm 75+ with underlying conditions (although nowhere near as severe - bless him), and have been debating with extended family about what to do.Return to US: Didn't like that letter out of Michigan saying ""Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority”, and administering ""pain control and comfort measures"" for those with a lesser chance. And after that, we heard the quaint phrase “Rationing health care resources”.Stay here: Given there's far fewer resources here, the same could happen.Our Blue Cross plan will reimburse 80% of the costs of health care here (A “Paperwork PIA” that takes months), so the cost of health care is not too much of a factor.Almost a No Brainer, doncha thinkEdited: 8:43 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"Thanks Ferd, local box stores such as Costco are deep cleaning at night and have early opening hours for seniors and folks with mobility and health problems, might help to minimize risk."
"A good analysis ferd. Each person will ultimately have to make a decision and you laid out the things to consider very well.I just saw another report, from an infection specialist (Whose name I can't remember) about going 'shopping'. Their recommendation was, yes: Wear a mask (If you have one or a bandana if you don't) and disposable gloves. The one thing I disagreed with was when they said ""Dispose of the gloves when you get home."". I personally took mine off when I had loaded my groceries in the car, BEFORE I got in the car, then disinfected my hands BEFORE I touched my steering wheel. After I unloaded my groceries I set them on a table for a couple hours, hit them with Lysol before I put them away. I had used another pair of disposable gloves moving everything from the car to the outside table, then sprayed THOSE gloves while they were still on my hands with Lysol. Every report I have read said the danger of infection from boxes and packaged food in a grocery story was very minimal. That last pair of gloves I kept near the front door AFTER I hit them with Lysol. Yes, all this is PROBABLY more than is necessary, but given my underlying health issues I am pretty realistic about my chances. If I GET COVID-19, I am dead. My chances of survival are probably around 5% or less. So I will take ALL steps I can to stay safe, but If I still get it, I will say goodby to my family and take what comes. Life has been good. I hope to have a bit more, but no real complaints.Edited: 12:10 pm, April 03, 2020 "

"No idea about the accuracy of the tweet you've posted. Local Mazatleco family was telling us today about what is happening around, lack of PPE for health workers and untreated patients dying in hallways and on front steps of local hospitals and IMSS, increase of home deaths in small towns."
"Actually, things are in pretty good condition in Mazatlan at the moment. (Culiacan, not so much.) There are not Covid19 patients in every hospital, or people laying dying. There are check-points at the city entrances as of today, as another measure of prevention, adding to the patrols already taking place near the beaches.You can follow the FB page of the Secretary of Health for Sinaloa for a daily breakdown of new cases for the various locations in Sinaloa. https:/… (The VerifiedTwitter content referenced above contains the same information)."
I see Mexico announced phase 3 of the epidemic this morning.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…
"Nayarit is under TOTAL lock down. The governor stated, emphatically: “We are going to have a strong hand, a firm hand (…) in the next two weeks that follow, we will not allow people on the street who are not justified. Whoever is on the streets without a valid reason, will be accompanied by the security authority to his home. AND LISTEN WELL: if they resist, they will take you to the cells"

"As of today: in Sinaloa there are a total of 1,261 confirmed cases of coronaviruses distributed in 17 municipalities, the figure includes 187 who died, 462 who were cured, and 612 who remain active. Mazatlan has 76 Cases. Six new as of today."
How are things now in mazatlan?
"Senior local Mazatleco family members self isolate in their homes and send children for food and necessities. Younger adults who can limit exposure continue to work in agriculture, operating equipment and trucks, as mechanics, etc. In our family and in the general immediate community there have been several C-19 deaths."
"We've noticed that people aren't practicing social distancing as well as they might, and cases are climbing. Spikes after gatherings on Children's Day and then again following Mother's Day."
Hotel Playa Mazatlan is closed at least until late June...maybe longer. Casa Azul open for breakfast...say hi to Roman.
