"Best weather at that time of year will be in the deserts. Try Palm Springs. You can visit Joshua Tree National Park from there. The park itself is not really a week-long destination unless you're into rock climbing and camping. You may be able to get a bus transfer to Palm Springs, but you need to rent a car if you want to get to Joshua Tree NP.You could also opt for Death Valley National Park, which has hotels, but again, it's pretty hard to get there from LAX unless you drive yourself. And it's a very large place so you need a car to get from your hotel to the sights."
"I personally like staying in Palm Springs. The Kimpton Rowan is a lovely hotel, but I'm always partial to that brand. I like being in town, within walking distance to a lot of different restaurants and window shopping. I've stayed in hotels in Rancho Mirage also, and it's fine, but I just like downtown Palm Springs better. I have not tried a resort at La Quinta. I don't find any one spot more picturesque than the others. The scenery in the valley is dominated by the mountains to the west, wherever you are. I don't think the resorts themselves will offer day trips, but there are companies that go around and pick up passengers at different hotels. Here's one: https:/… Viator is another company that is a tour reseller. You can get an idea of what's available through them, but I'd try to find the original provider and book direct rather than going through Viator so you have better contact info and more recourse if something goes wrong.The weather in the deserts in late December is pleasant. Usually in the low- to mid-70s F, but it gets down to the 40s at night.There are no beach areas in So Cal where it's likely to be warm enough to swim and sunbathe at the end of December. It might happen, it does some years, but that's a real roll of the dice. If you want a warm beach vacation, just get on another plane when you arrive at LAX and head straight for Mexico."
"Palm Springs at Christmas is cold (60s/15c) but clear. You won't find warm/hot weather anywhere the last week of December, but it won't be cold like the UK, and it will likely be clear.What made you decide to fly into LAX? Why not stay in LA?"
"Regarding renting a car. It would be the best way to keep yourselves well, otherwise you are traveling in a vehicle with strangers who may or may not be sick. Also, the rental car companies are struggling to stay in business and you will help support them.If you decide on Palm Springs I believe the airport there is an international airport. So you can choose that rather than LAX.I live about 30 minutes west of Palm Springs. Although it does get cold in late December there are also warm days. It's mostly cold during the nights.Edited: 12:02 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Roads are quiet the week between Christmas and New Year - don't worry about traffic to PS. However, it's unsafe to drive there after a long flight from the UK, so you'd have to stay overnight in LA before setting out in your rental car (the only way to get there) to PS.If you like big resorts, then you're fine with the resorts you chose - and yes you will need a car if you want to go out shopping, or to dinner - they aren't close to downtown Palm Springs, about 20 minutes or so by car.The PS airport is an option if you fly via O'Hare Chicago or La Guardia, etc. There's no direct flight from the UK. and flying from LAX to PS makes no sense at all."
"You are aware that Los Angeles county has 10 million people and is one of the most infectious Covid19 hotspots in the world right?Not only that they can not or do not or will not wear masks or wear them properly And social distance even though it's supposed to be one of the most effective way to save lives.Furthermore, there was ALot of property and businesses destroyed in LA environs.While we certainly need your money I'd find somewhere better than that to travel to . No one enforces the law."
"If you stay at an airport hotel before leaving for Palm Springs so will be away from the areas that have been looted. Of course, there is a good possibility they will have been repaired by the end of the year. Even tourist spots Beverly Hills and Santa Monica experienced unrest. Are you aware of the riots? Have you heard that our president has threatened military actions and has even had police attack peaceful protesters? It is doubtful the US will get better until after January 20th when we get a new president. Manhattan Beach is next to LAX and a small lovely community if you want to stay there for a night or two. In regards to COVID-19, it's expected that the US is in danger of a second wave in the fall and winter. At this time we have already had 7 days of protests against police brutality all over the country, including several spots in Southern California. Some are quite large with no social distancing, many wearing masks and some not, but lots of loud chanting. This means the virus is more likely to be spread now than ever. This makes a second wave more likely. You don't need to come all this way to put yourself in danger. Perhaps something closer to home or think in terms of next spring around Easter. The weather is likely to be warmer then too.Edited: 4:00 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"#10 & 11, get a grip, the OP is not traveling until the last week of December. Traffic is extremely light during that time since many employers give their workers the week off.If the Coronavirus is still around in December we have more serious problems to worry about as we would probably be in the middle of a damn Depression. When driving around running errands yesterday I saw a number of stores closed for good, 4 in one strip mall alone including a Baskin Robbins ice cream store, a nail salon, a hobby store, a Game Stop store and a barber shop that had been there for over 20 years. And by closed, I mean the signs were removed from the outside of the building and the windows, no fixtures, just an empty room.As far as the riots and protests, the ""party is over"", funeral was today."
There is NO party in DTLA There are protestors right in DTLA this very second. And ALot of National Guard present.
"None of this is going away. I'm usually an optomist, but this all is getting serious and staying serious. If the OP wants to just visit a national park, that's probably fine. But making plans to do so from LAX complicates things.Personally I don't see why the need to travel so far to get warm anyway. Rich??Edited: 12:48 am, June 05, 2020 "
"""As far as the riots and protests, the ""party is over"", funeral was today."" Funerals don't make murder at the hands of police go away."
"As fellow Brits we have stayed in both Palm Springs and San Diego. We fly with British Airways as well and have always been very happy with them apart from cancelling our flight home last September during the pilots strike but that's another story. They also fly into San Diego which may be better for you if considering staying there as you would be able to go straight to your hotel from airport. Think hiring a car is going to be a necessity. Driving in the US is easier then you think once you get used to car and turning right on red unless told otherwise! It's also a pretty scenic drive from La Quinta to San Diego via the 74. You could stay over night in the small town of Julian before going onto San Diego or vice versa. We much preferred the La Quinta area to Palm Springs itself but really liked San Diego which can be as relaxed or as busy as you like. Coronado Island where we stayed was really lovely, and seeing the Hotel Coronado was a treat as 'Some like it hot' was filmed there. Can't comment on the weather at the end of the year but in September the evenings have been quite cool. It's also a good idea about renting your own condo. Have used Home Away and Air BNB a few times both very reliable. It gives the extra independence of being able to do your own thing without being hurried.  As at the moment with the Covid 19 problems everywhere we are resigned to the fact we may not be able to have our annual US road trip September and will have to cancel all our bookings but something to look forward to next year."
"Wonderar, that's really helpful. Thank you.I did look at flights into San Diego but they weren't available for the companion voucher that I had.La Quinta does look like a good base and we are weighing up renting our own place over a resort. I am always a little wary with AirBnB as I'be heard a lot of stories about scams (arriving and there not being a place for us to stay).At least if we can't go I can change the booking until next year, but its nice to have something to plan in the meantime. I'll make sure I book everything on a basis where it can be cancelled.Which places did you enjoy visiting the most in the area?Did you find places to eat out or did you dine a lot in your condo?Thank you."
Due diligence has to be done with either a VRBO (Homeaway) or AitBnB. The later is an SF based company which is shedding employees like my cat does fur. May not survive the pandemic.
"Hi Hope I can be of some help to you. I live in Manhattan Beach, 3 mi so of LAX. (the airport is 20 mi from downtown LA) It’s a cute local beach town, with lots of cafes, restaurants and boutique shops. Our most popular place to stay is the Sea View Inn, a block up from the beach. They have free parking, use of beach bikes for the bike path, a small heated pool and kitchens if you wanted. Local owner. www.theseaviewinn.comThey are 5 buildings from motel units to 1-2 bedrooms apartments on four corners and balconies with great sunset views. In Dec. the locals are wearing shorts, flip flops and a sweatshirt over a T-shirt when they go out for B& L. Great place to get over jet lag and a couple days are fun. We happen to go out year around to the desert, except summer We stay a week at Easter, Thanksgiving and the day after Christmas thru NYE.. The La Quinta Resort is a favorite of ours and the landscaping if fabulous There are 41 swimming pools all around the Casitas to choose from. It was originally built in 1926 right next to the mountains in a perfect setting. There are 4-5 restaurants on site and over in Old Town LQ are others. Our favorite is Lavender Bistro on the patio. The drive out is 2+. Not much traffic that week. We take the 105 freeway E at the start at LAX. It skips the downtown LA area and is faster. Check navigation. We do 105E-605N-60Emerge to 10E. We’ve stayed in all the desert towns. We like the Hyatt Indian Wells as they have a nice adult pool away from the family pools. Rooms have step down sitting area and are large."
"Drop the idea of a private rental - for several reasons. One is that if you need to cancel, it will be difficult to get all your money back. Two, the hotels and resorts really need our business, let's support them. And finally, the ease of moving a reservation, or of getting a refund, plus the ease of stay with housekeeping and other built in conveniences.#20 gives great advice of staying at Sea View Inn the night of arrival into LAX before heading off to PS. Keep in mind that La Quinta is in the valley, but not close to Palm Springs, so a night out there, or a day of shopping, is about 20 minutes drive."
"OP sorry for the non-travel ramblings of a couple of posters. Both are way out of bounds.La Quinta and Rancho Mirage are very nice, but the resorts tend to be BIG, it is hard to walk off the property, you have to drive almost everyplace. That is why I'd prefer Downtown Palm Springs, where you can walk to all kinds of fun dining, sights and shops.The Hilton in DTPS is nice and the Courtyard by Marriott okay.For a rental, we've used the site below for years.https://vacationpalmsprings.com/You definitely will need a car."
"Based on your desire for less crowds and fewer kids, I think Palm Springs is a better option for you. But I’m not a fan if the big resorts. Picking up the car upon arrival will be much more convenient but it’s your decision as to whether that extra time after a long flight is feasible."
"If you want adults only, and quiet, but near shops and restaurants, then Palm Springs for sure. Hotels like Sparrows Lodge, Holiday House, Kimpton Rowan. This way, you really don't need a car to do anything at all except to get from LA to PS.Palm Springs isn't dead at Christmas, but it's not what I would call lively, either. It's a great respite."
If you insist on coming I can vouch for LA Quinta Resort & Spa. It's a beautiful resort and we hardly ever leave the grounds when we go. I will say December is cooler so get a room with a balcony and fire pit to snuggle up if it ends up being cool. LA has nearly half the Covid19 cases which they're already said theyre concerned of it spreading and then you have the uprises that some believe is a movement that this time isn't going to stop with feel good things that eventually lead blacks right back to Civil Rights. They're tired of empty promises with a few crumbs here and there to pacify them.They're native here yet a minority with no money or voice which is unconstitutional. White people should of had their backs ages ago. This is their country.
"Many of us have driven “a first time” in the UK. We got our car rental, drove around the lot a couple times, and headed out. It helps to have the passenger looking with you at first! The drive to MB is quite straightforward Get the car after you land. Easy free parking at the Sea View. When you leave for the desert head down Rosecrans Ave. If you stay elsewhere than downtown PS, you could choose Thursday to visit. You can walk the shops in an hour or two. They have Villagefest that evening where they close down a few blocks on Palm Canyon Dr to traffic and you can walk the craft and food booths. Also after 4 PM the Art Museum downtown is free. Staying at LQ Resort is a beautiful oasis with bougainvillea everywhere, lime, grapefruit and lemon trees all around. We never feel crowded as there are acres of paths to walk around and all the pools. There is a huge main pool that kids like with music and food service. We prefer the smaller pools outside our casita. If you want food or drink service order room service and a golf cart will deliver it. You can look on TA for many photos of the grounds. The Plaza is in the center of the resort. No high rises like the Marriott."
">>>Would you suggest hire a car from the airport or get a cab to Manhattan beach and then hire a car when we leave for the desert?<<<That sounds like a lot off work for one night, with luggage.I'd stay at the LAX Marriott or Residence Inn and make life simple. There is also the Homewood Suites LAX and Home2 Suites from Hilton. They are all great places."
"Manhattan Beach is very close to the airport, maybe a 15 minute drive or so. All the airport car rental agencies are off the airport grounds and you take a shuttle bus to their offices.I like Manhattan Beach and lived there for almost 20 years and find most of the airport hotels along Century Blvd pretty boring but would be OK if you just need them for one night plus they have free airport transfers so you could pick up your car the next day.I hope you have a good trip and enjoy your stay"
There is an adult only pool at La Quinta with a bar and mmusic. Great way to spend the holiday and in the evening eat at one of their fingers dining restaurants. Know this is what it looked like prior 2020.
"After replying to you previously I would like to throw out a different suggestion. Are you set on LA or open to another area such as Scottsdale in Arizona? It's an easy 20 minute drive from PHX Sky Harbor. We really enjoy staying in Scottsdale as it seems to have something for everyone plus numerous different types of resturants to several high class hotel resorts and casinos. This is where we usually rent our condos as easy to fly in and out of Phoenix with BA. Once again a hire car is needed but the condos we have rented have been supplied with everything, from fully stocked kitchens, all linens and most importantly a washer and drier and spotlessly clean. Sedona would be lovely to visit although I would think they would have snow around this time of year? Cannot comment on weather but sure someone else would give you a heads up there. Flagstaff is also interesting and Tucson in the opposite direction as well for day trips.Hope this helps."
Hope you mange to find somewhere to suit your needs soon.We all need something to look forward to in these dreadful times.
I believe you will be able to have a great time as COVID-19 will (hopefully) be a History in December 2020.

"best you book your car via an agent in UK, so the insurance is included. And most agents offer a weekly rate which is cheaper or the same price than 5 days."
"We do such trips often. And we always stay the first night in an airport-hotel with free airport-shuttle. The next morning we go back via shuttle to the airport and via shuttle to the car rental company to get our booked car. I don't think you'll need a few nights for acclimatise, but you'd know it better. And if you want sightseeing LA you for sure need a few nights."
"Just FYI, it is spelled Beverly Hills (no extra E).I think a night in an airport hotel or nearby like El Segundo or Manhattan Beach is a good idea, then pick up the car the next day."
