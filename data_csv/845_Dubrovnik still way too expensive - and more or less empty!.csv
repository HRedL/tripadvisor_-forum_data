"These prices are not drastic at all when you look at some other destinations. Hence why so many Britons are drawn to Dubrovnik, France has become too expensive for them. The coast has been too expensive for locals and other form inland for years, not just Dubrovnik."
"What I don't understand is the price of seafood. The price of simple grilled fish is completely ridiculous. The prices of spaghetti, pizza and meat dishes seem OK by western standards, though the dishes are a bit monotonous and boring."
"I don't think the food in the Balkans or Croatia in general is monotonous, but I think its a feature of touristy areas that few locals frequent. Restaurants don't have to fight for business, customers arrive anyway. If you look at low and mid end restaurants, its as if they've copied the menus from each other. Only high end restaurants where a meal for two costs ridiculous amounts serve something interesting. As for prices for hotels, well, I can tell you my experience. I booked a high end apartment in Korčula (arriving tomorrow), and now that I look at the apartment prices before and after my stay, the apartment is available, and the price is lower than what I'm paying. So how does that make me feel? Well, of course, I feel a bit cheated, as I'm paying more for a cheaper apartment. So in a way, by offering cheaper prices to attract new customers, the apartment owner devalued his apartment for the existing customers. So imagine a more extreme case, what if I book a 5* hotel for 400 euros, and they decrease the price to 200 euros to attract more customers. What would they tell to their existing customers?"
"Supply and demand, that's the law and on the long term is always true. On the other hand I would appreciate more ""home food"" dishes around croatian Knobe for example. They can follow the example of greek taverna, a lot of traditional dishes offered. They are very successful."
">Food may be a bit monotonous by Western standards, but that's simply inheritance of the prevailing influences through the history - Austrian, Hungarian, Italian, Ottoman Turkish... None of these countries have a highly exciting cuisine<Really? Italian and Turkish cuisine is mediterranian. Very healthy and very good"
"Yes, I would like to taste the local flavour, traditional dishes. I always see the same menu on almost every restaurant"
