"We took advantage of the great rates to Hawaii and are trying to plan out our trip. Right now I just have 1 way tickets booked from Las Vegas to Honolulu, but would like to book 1 way back from Maui and see if we can visit both islands. We will be traveling June 2nd to June 11th. There will be 4 of us traveling. We will rent a car in both places.1. Will this be enough time to see both islands? We will probably want to spend most of our time on Maui but would like to see Pearly Harbor and the PCC.2. If we only have time to snorkel on one island, is it best to do it in Maui or Honolulu?3. What airlines goes from Honolulu to Maui?4. (I may not be saving much after adding all of this in, but we thought it would be a good time to try because we don't know when we will be able to take our kids out again.) But, with that being said, there is enough to do in either place and we would be fine to just do one island. If that is the case....should I just turn our flights into Round trip Tickets to one island and call it good?Thanks for any guidance."
"I'd make sure anything you book can be cancelled and refunded......since no one knows where we will be with COVID-19 then.I'd also prob only do one island with kids. Too expensive and a hassle to move on short trips.Edited: 4:42 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Are these tickets on HA? I saw an email about $159 rates from LAS.1. Long enough to see some of each island. I want to add a few days.2. Maui 3. HawaiianMakani Kai Mokulele SWA4. Depends. What else would you want to do on each?
"Hmmm ... nine nights.Can you see both Islands? Kinda. You would fly between the Islands, and the process consumes about a 1/2 day. The flight itself is short ... but the process is the same TSA time-consuming protocol - and you would need to change cars, accommodations, etc. I would skip the PCC. Not really a top-tier activity (in my opinion). Yes, the PCC is super-hyped and advertised. If you were going to spend more time on Oahu ... then OK. What works for some visitors ... is to visit Pearl Harbor National Memorial on the way home ... between flights. That may not work for you ... and we don't know the ages of your kids. How much do you want to ""keep it simple?""Snorkel on Maui. Hawaiian Airlines flies between the Islands. They also fly from Las Vegas to Maui/and back. Bottom line: You could spend a month on either Island ... and not scratch the surface. The Islands are large - and diverse ... and will keep you as busy as you want to be. Yes, I'd go round-trip to Maui ... but we don't know the ages of your kids. It's really up to you to determine what is the best fit for your family. (Not an easy decision!)**If your frame of reference is the Caribbean or Mexico - note that Hawaii is very, very different.You will need a car on Maui for sure. For Oahu ... you will want a car to venture out of the City of Honolulu."
I'd rent a car. I'd spend all 9 days on Maui. With a round trip in and out of there (purchased from the start).
Thank You all for your advice.My kids are adults so that part is easy.
"Today it was roundtrip to Honolulu for $215, but I booked a one way to Honolulu for $108 and then a return from Maui for $195. I thought that was pretty good. Now I just need to book from Honolulu to Maui. I know I am going about this all backwards...hahaha"
"Oh, when you mentioned the PCC ... I thought it was for ""kids"" ... kiddies. Is this your first trip to Hawaii? Fear not! We all had our training wheels on at first."
