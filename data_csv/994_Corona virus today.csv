"What is the situation of Corona virus today 1/08/2020, thanks"
What particular aspect of the crisis do you want to know about?
If you google coronavirus nerja it gives you the latest updates on numbers etc
"Last time I looked, Nerja has had 7 infections (people tested positive with coronavirus) since March and no death.Edited: 5:30 am, August 01, 2020 "
"At least one death at the last count - a few weeks ago. Positives are 14+, again a few weeks ago. Figures generally unreliable or not widely available these days."
If your location is correct nerja has significantly less problems than lyon.
"Ive heard that the mask is mandatory when sunbathing? Is that correct?Cause first I saw it would be if ppl wanted to go for a walk on the beach but not sunbathing.Im here in the middle of the fence if we should go or not, cause mask while sunbathing is not an option lolEdited: 4:20 am, August 03, 2020 "
Marie Antoinette seems to have lost interest
"Perhaps she's busy eating cake, Tricky?"
"Hi All, Sorry for jumping on the post, I wanted to save another duplicated post. I due to fly out 26th August and Like the poster I am on the fence presently. Looking on Facebook I can see activities from my usual watering grounds and places. But what is the situation on mask, when are they allowed the be removed and the media there seems quite positive overall? I'm stopping near Burriana, thaks in advance :)"
Mask are not required when subathing on the beach or at the pool but need to be worn when walking about (except between you spot on the beach/poolside and the sea/pool if heading for a swim. No need to wear one when seated in bars/restaurants but walking about passing other people should be worn. In shops and in the streets mask up.
She might have even lost her head Winch
I’ve been in nerja for the last week. You get used to wearing a mask fairly quickly. Never been before and while it’s fairly busy I imagine it’s nowhere near what it’s like during a normal summer.
Nothing at all like a 'normal' summer...And a new case of COVID-19 in Nerja today...Around 10% of people are still not wearing masks unfortunately.
Very busy in the supermarkets and on the roads. Doesnt seem much different to me. Just a lack of brits/irish voices. Spanish have made up for them. Same in frigiliana. Very busy
"500 new cases in Andalucía since Friday, a terrifying 5,000 new cases in Aragon. Enjoy being out and about whilst you still can, if Sánchez doesn’t do something this week you’ll be locked down again."
"Figures as ever seem to vary no soy, no doubt though which direction they are heading though.Atb steve"
You enter the beach with the mask on but once you start sunbathing or swimming no need to wear it. You just put it on when leaving. The same applies to beach restaurants. You can put it down when seated.
"I agree bemusednewt that not everyone is wearing a mask, i went out yesterday afternoon & was surprised to see more people with them under their chins & a few with none at all. Luckily small numbers but that doesn't make it ok.Not good numbers are they nosoyguiri? Was always going to hsppen, in my opinion. I take it, re all of your warning messages, that you have taken the decision to stay put in the UK & not risk travelling?"
"I have no intention of travelling to Spain anytime soon, although I can understand why those who are young and fit might want to risk it. The UK comes in for a lot of grief over its figures, but I’d far rather the definition was too wide and people know the risk rather than changing the definition to such a narrow one (as the Spanish government did at the end of May) that it suppresses information rather than the virus.Quite unbelievable that Sánchez still hasn’t imposed travel restrictions between regions, especially at the time of year when so many Spaniards are travelling elsewhere in the country. Johnson came in for a lot of grief a week ago for reintroducing quarantining rules for people coming from Spain - easy to imagine what those same media critics would be moaning about now had he not.Another issue is becoming trapped - so many people who were first time around are unaware that their insurance is no longer valid as they’ve been overseas more than 90 consecutive days. At Your Own Risk.Edited: 3:36 pm, August 04, 2020 "
Another case of Coronavirus announced today. That's two in the last 7 days. Not good.
"Oh dear, not good at all :( Stay safe everyone and follow the guidelines."
There are a lot more than one case now . Lack of controls in Plaza TuttiFruttie area is the rumour. That is not confirmed but the numbers of positive cases are.
"That I think is the biggest worry there ^^ post #23, that the correct figures are not being reported, or there is a long delay between diagnoses and reporting. I've said it before, the asymptomatic element of this (and any pandemic) is the most worrying when people behave as if they're fine when in reality they aren't.Alcohol, party life, wet T shirt competitions, never going to be conducive to social distancing, whether it be in Tutti Frutti or other clubbing areas."
"The press (with the honourable if slightly unexpected exception of El País) insists on faithfully reporting the number of new cases the Ministerio de Salud reports as ‘new cases yesterday’. Thus they miss those new cases that take a couple of days to be reported. Whilst cases in Andalucía are still much lower than the worst-hit regions in the north such as Aragon and Cataluña there are still no restrictions on travel between regions. Lots of Verano Azul fans will be heading to Nerja, TV-tourism at a much lower price than usual.As for the partying, much of Tutti-Frutti is indoors and best avoided at the moment. Look at all the chaos caused by the Malagueños partying in Los Alamos, Torremolinos, last weekend - and they were outside! Do NOT use Jägermeister as a disinfectant btw, it’s not alcoholic enough to be effective. At Your Own Risk.Edited: 10:29 am, August 06, 2020 "
"@#15 and 19. Spain is a democracy which precludes President Sanchez from unilaterally declaring travel restrictions across the whole of Spain. For people who might not know, he has a very wobbly coalition government. His party only hold 120 out of 350 seats in Congress. So, to limit freedom of movement nationally, a new State of Alarm will have to be declared and that will need to get through a vote in Congress. It is by no means certain there would be enough support from PP, Cs and Vox, along with many other minority parties, to get it through. A failed attempt could see the government fall and yet more elections at a time when our country desperately needs stable leadership. Yes, we might all end up in lockdown again, but I doubt it will happen until the tourist season is over. Financially the country is on its knees and another total lockdown would cause a recession such as no one has seen in recent history. Let’s hope the growing outbreaks can be controlled without the nuclear option. Stay well everyone.Edited: 11:58 am, August 06, 2020 "
"There are 580 active clusters today, as against 483 this time last week. Keeping the tourist season going is rather like concentrating on improving the bar profits on the Titanic."
Certainly is. The reports and figures from the nursing homes today in Madrid and Aragon are chilling. Just tragic.
"It appears that the two cases are connected to Pepe Moles and Obelix Plaza - who I understand have shut their doors for the time being?? Can anyone who's on the ground there confirm?If so, I wonder if any of the customers were infected and don't know?? I hope they go get tests ASAP so that they can self isolate and reduce the risk of spreading it further otherwise the future of the Nerja economy is going to look even more bleak."
"Some numbers from the local press for the last 7 days (from monday before)Marbella, with 124 positives, followed by Fuengirola (18), Estepona (14), Torremolinos (10) and Benalmádena (seven). In the district of Malaga, 57 infections have been reported by PCR in the last seven days (all in the capital). In the district of Guadalhorce, 12; in La Vega, 5; in Serranía, 5 and in Axarquía, 4."
"Not sure if these cases have yet to be added to the totals but Pepe Moles and Obelix now closed and staff quarantining after cases at both establishments. It's starting to look bad. Keep your distance, folks."
Pepe Moles has posted on his FB page and been very open about it. I’ve heard from family who live in Nerja re. the Tutti Frutti situation. All I will say is that I would avoid that area if I was over.
Nightclubs should have never been reopened.As someone who spent many years working in such environments they are a breeding ground for germs at the best of times.
"Two very valid posts @32, 33 - and I couldn't agree more. With the increased body heat, sweat, close proximity of dancing, drinking, it's a hotbed of germs and god knows what else.Bars (especially outdoor areas) of course, much less chance of infection and if managed correctly inside restaurants and bars too, but Nightclubs shouldn't have opened imo.I just hope people see these new figures and start taking precautions."
"Pepe Mole’s is a very different kettle of fish to suspected outbreaks in Tutti-Frutti though, as it’s popular with foreign visitors doing tapas runs - perhaps it’s as well there aren’t so many there at the moment, and those that are would be well-advised not to do tapas runs. A few infected people could lead to the closure of all the central Nerja places. Stick to your favourite place folks, and stay seated outside."
Pepes daughter tested positive so the restaurant has closed as a precaution.so not a direct connection to customers. And one staff member at the other place
"the daughter doesnt live in nerja but the law says they still have to close.her parents and family and the rest of the staff tested negative so the bar will reopen.so basically a non story.Edited: 1:59 pm, August 06, 2020 "
It was scheduled to reopen today
"Poor Pepe, I hope his daughter makes a speedy recovery.such a shame for his business too, always spotless, best tapas ever (imo) & hugely popular with the locals. I believe that he has only been serving tapas outside.I wish him well."
"Post 33, I quite agree wanderingL. All the latest info (worldwide) seems to be pointing the finger at younger peeople being the main spreaders of the virus."
"I understand Pepe Moles did reopen today by another family member who has not had contact with the daughter. I hope people in Nerja feel they can support this place. It’s a very delicate situation all round for shops and bars and I’m hearing of people ‘being encouraged’ to work when perhaps they shouldn’t be. I don’t want to go into details, I’m sure most people in this forum are aware of the Nerja rumour mill. My young niece works in a bar and is having to be tested, along with many others, which is a good thing. It’s all a fine balance between risk and trying to save the season for many businesses."
"Malaga & to the west appears to be a concern at present & nightclubs a highlighted problem.""The number of people testing positive for coronavirus continues to rise in the Malaga area. Small, separate local outbreaks in coastal holiday resorts west of the city are a particular focus for the health authorities at the moment.""surinenglish.com/local/202008/06/local-coron…""124 were identified in Marbella, 18 in Fuengirola, 14 in Estpeona, 10 in Torremolinos and 7 in Benalmádena. There were 57 new cases in Malaga city in the last week, 12 in the Guadalhorce valley, 5 in the La Vega area around Antequera, 5 in the Ronda area and 4 in Axarquía. Most cases show no symptoms."""
Extending quarantine for the foreseeable cannot be in much doubt now as figures generally seem to be going in one direction only.Atb steve
Four more cases in Nerja over the weekend so it is now officially classified as an ‘outbreak’. This means those businesses that stay open have to take extra precautions and is the first step towards further restrictions.
"#42, what has the West of Malaga got to do with this thread in the Nerja Forum?? It is a real shame you feel the need to try and score points at a time when the situation in Spain is going from bad to worse. #44 - not looking good is it NoSoyGuiri, maybe a second lockdown for Nerja?"
"The next phase is closure of bars and restaurants, and the re-introduction of local travel restrictions to keep the outbreak in a ‘bubble’. Things have to get very very bad before the full lockdown stage is reached. Don’t believe the rubbish the EuroWeekly News is posting about a further national lockdown having been already planned. It hasn’t."
"No one knows for sure what plans central govt has moving forward, but they will have to take more authoritative action before long, though media speculation is probably guesswork, mid september for a return to wider measures across spain does not seen that unrealistic, the numbers currently will not come down on their own.Once the big spanish getaway has declined at the end of august anything is possible.Atb steve"
"""media speculation is probably guesswork"" I couldn't agree more Steve, the latest fiasco regarding the EWN is a case in point. Irresponsible journalism at its worst, and then to try and manipulate the story into ""it's the readers fault for getting it wrong"" - no wonder people were in a panic regarding the potential lockdown next month (a non story of course) - their credibility (as if they ever had any anyway) has hit rock bottom.However, that being said I think you're probably right, once they've got what they can from the tourist season then they may well impose more restrictions - finding the balance between protecting the economy and protecting lives!!!edit. Apologies NoSoyGuri - I didn't spot your post before Steves and the EWN reference.Edited: 7:45 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Post 45, GS2017..says""It is a real shame you feel the need to try and score points...""How pathetic! Do grow up, stop harassing others & maybe heed your own comments. You say "" ...when the situation in Spain is going from bad to worse"". Yes it is! And furthermore east or west makes no difference in what you attempt to infer, were Nerja/ towns east of Malaga included in that article then it would still have been posted! So please quit with your constant insinuations.Posts 43 & 47 I quite agree with you benisteve. Once travel re started, whether that be from overseas or inland Spain, the infection rate was bound to rise again. From now on it is very much a wait & see game with fingers firmly crossed."
Surely this is a Nerja forum.!! Moderator needs to clean up the post and remove these idiots trying to frighten people.
"At #50,people are not idiots just because their information and opinion does not fit in with your own view.Generally no one is frightening anyone, lots of information on here just informs people.Being a favourite holiday place for many does not mean it has a magic wand over it warding off possible risks or other impacts moving forward, much the same as elsewhere."
"Missing the point, This is a Nerja Forum as I suggested,and yes there are idiots that shouldnt post here."
"At #52 , then why not give the OP some of your own unmissable and profound insight about the situation in nerja then rather than worrying about what everyone else is saying."
"It is actually against TA rules to infer that people should not be posting, and it’s difficult to see what is gained by calling people idiots too."
"Nonsense, please update yourself... When people act like idiots, chances are.... They are idiots"
"Blimey. What is it about the Nerja forum that attracts the self-righteous? I read other TA forums and they are, in the main, civilised and helpful. This one has people referring to others as trolls, idiots, liars, fakes and so on ad nauseam."
"snafu, as normal on this forum unfortunately."
"Post 59, quite agree Bemusednewt, the perpetrator (including the flagrant use of many guises) & their snafu intent on Nerja forum is as clear as day. Lots of people lead a sad life but don't feel the need to resort to such nastiness."
"NMB, I agree that the Nerja forum certainly seems to attract a lot of bickering and back-biting - I used to think it was because there were strict lines drawn on the sewerage issue but here we go again and all about nothing really. Perhaps the hot weather has made the prickly folk more prickly than usual! Hopefully newcomers thinking of visiting Nerja skim past it all.Edited: 12:32 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"A lot to skim past, Winchmoren!"
"Another new COVID-19 case today, making five since the weekend. Beaches, including Burriana, have been reaching capacity and still around 10% of people seem to refuse to mask-up when out and about so there is a sort of inevitability about how things will go.Edited: 1:36 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"The Ministry of Health and Family of the Junta de Andalucía has reported a new case of coronavirus in Nerja that, with those detected until yesterday, add up to seven positives in the last 14 days, and a total of 18 since the start of the pandemic . In Axarquía, the number of cases confirmed by PCR in the last 14 days rises to 23, of which 20 are from the last week. In total, there are 259 cases of coronavirus in the region since the beginning of the pandemic, of which 196 have been cured. The Councilor for Health, Javier Rodríguez, asks citizens not to lower their guard, especially the youth, who are concentrating the largest number of outbreaks, and recalls that the Junta de Andalucía has established a sanctions regime for those who violate the rules of established. The mayor of Nerja, José Alberto Armijo, asks neighbors and visitors for prudence and responsibility to maintain discipline in the application of preventive sanitary measures, especially the constant cleaning of hands with soap or hydrogel, the permanent use of a mask , and keep the distance of at least one and a half meters with people who are not from your family unit."
"How does a tourist area even hope to control this virus, it would be nearly impossible to control the movement of people as we have done in the U.K.How is this 7 cases in 14 days viewed locally, alarmingly high, or low and manageable, local views would be appreciated"
"Another two cases in Nerja this morning, it’s now officially classified as a ‘brote’ (outbreak/cluster). Expect some lockdown measures to come in fairly swiftly, yet still it seems no local travel restrictions. It’s out of control in Aragon and Cataluña now, and even Andalucía, which was doing well, has passed 55 cases per 100,000 region-wide.No government (local, regional or national) en Agosto. It’s a disgrace."
Thank you for the update NoSoyGuiri - certainly worrying times ahead.
"How is this 7 cases in 14 days viewed locally, alarmingly high, or low and manageable, local views would be appreciated------------Obviously cant speak for others but for me it not a big deal. its all about perspective,which imo is something that has been lost for the huge part. A normal population of 20,000 raising to i dunno add another 5-10k of holiday makers this year? So 17 cases since march is nothing. I think everyone expected cases to raise as restrictions were lifted and ppl travelled around but it comes down to whos getting it ie young ppl and where the outbreaks are stemming from. if direct connections for the most part are been made its easier to control. You worry when you start getting hundreds of cases where there seems to be no direct corralation to a certain event. As ive said many a time nightclubs and the such should have never been reopened.(or maybe let the young get it and create some immunity if you go with those theories) but other than that and obviously closing effected establishments for quarantine, others will and should carry on as normal because at the end of the day this isnt suddenly going to disapear overnight.ppl have to learn to live with it and deal with it.take basic hand washing precautions etc and get on with it. Or is everyone gonna hide under their beds for the next year or so while they get a vaccine or it declines naturally.Form experience this has brought out the drama queens and the hypochrondriacs in a bundance."
".The situation is not helped by people not obeying the rules. The law, in fact.Three young women in their early twenties, I should guess, just sitting around on the ground chatting with no masks when everyone around was wearing them and it was clearly required. I went over and said to them in a very polite voice ""Me hacen el favor de ponerse la mascarilla?"" I said it in Spanish despite them being clearly English, thought it might have more effect. They obviously knew why I was speaking to them, they giggled and smirked, then one replied ""Sorry, I don't understand Spanish"".I then put on my Teacher Voice ""PUT YOUR MASKS ON, NOW!"" They immediately did. Not all that long since they left school, then, so I lowered my estimate of their age. I got a few claps from other bystanders.Just wear your masks, and wear them properly (over your nose and mouth both), when you are supposed to!Keep safe, everyone.Edited: 9:33 am, August 13, 2020 "
Very well done to you - I really don’t understand why so many people these days think that rules and the law doesn’t apply to them. It’s not just the younger generation either....... Really don’t understand why there is such a big deal made about wearing masks - if it means your protecting yourself and others then just do it. Every little helps at this stage.We are still hopeful that we can be back in Nerja in the Autumn - keeping everything crossed for now.
"For anyone to suggest in any way that spains current problems are the the resuslt of the odd tourist/s from the uk not wearing a mask is frankly delusionalThough the idea will get support from those with no intention to travel anywhere, any time soon, its bogus!.Spain with fairly limited international tourism seems to be doing a pretty good job generally of spreading it around without any help from the uk or anywhere else too."
^^ 100% correct and keeping it real Steve as always.
Benisteve is right. The huge increases in new cases in virtually all the regions of Spain is not as a result of UK tourists. I can only go by what I see on Menorca. That is groups of local teenagers who think wearing masks is for cissies and hangout in groups with no attempt at distancing and passing bottles around. They have bought into the idea that they are either immune or will be asymptomatic. Presumably they are not remotely bothered about giving it to their parents or elderly relatives. Nothing feels very safe here anymore.
"Is another reason, Spain not doing total local lockdowns.Locally when we reached 12 cases in 7 days, (population 91,000), we started a full lockdown, which will be a month on Monday."
"Anyone suggesting now,which i doubt that the uk tourists,who have effectivly been banned by boris from coming here has had an effect on figures would be pretty stupid. Of course there was a concern at the begining.but the quarentine put an end to that quick enough.And places like aragon are hardly top of the list for most brits. It did make me chuckle reading the local press about how some essex boys and some others spent their first night direct off the plane in a prison cell and then up before the courts after refusing to wear masks on the flight and then trying to be spanglish funny with the guardia (not a good idea)It will be intresting to see the figures once we get into september and the spanish head back inland after finishing their hols. Personally im surprised about the amount of french cars and you still see quite alot of scandies aswell. At the end of the day ppl want to get away and have a break cant blame them for thatSpain made a big mistake opening up nightclubs etc as this is a huge spreader of the virus and as its so hot ppl will get sick of the masks (especially the young who maybe dont have the si senor franco attitude of the older generations) thats the problem when you inforce such strict rules re wearing masks. Ppl start to see it as ott when walking in the fresh air no where near anyone else around you for tens of mtrs.obedience will start to flag especially when ppl dont see it ending anytime soon. Aslong as the hospitals arent filling up and its young healthy ppl getting it and its no more to them than the average virus then its a keep calm and carry on situation✌ we will see come mid spetember if the situation changesEdited: 10:20 am, August 14, 2020 "
"Is another reason, Spain not doing total local lockdowns.Locally when we reached 12 cases in 7 days, (population 91,000), we started a full lockdown, which will be a month on Monday.-----------The northern areas did do lockdowns in certain towns several weeks ago.Where are you Ian re your lockdown?"
A Little update. Nightclubs will now be shut across the country. And smoking in public is banned if you cannot keep 1.5 mtrs away from ppl.
"For those interested the UK are going by these data to determine which countries get quarantined.https:/…Countries exceeding 20 cases per 100k over 2 weeks are potentially added to the quarantine list. Spain is currently 111, with UK at 17. We are supposed to be in Nerja end of October but I doubt it will happen now :("
"Great news WanderingL that nightclubs are to close & not before time I say.I'm still somewhat confused as to why Nerja has been highlighted here, their cases are (for now) lower than many other places on the CDS yet the same warnings had not been issued on the other forums. I'm still saddened to see a few people adamantly wearing their masks under their chins, I guess they think they can quickly pull them up if they see the police. Thankfully it is still a minority though. We still have another couple of weeks until the Spanish return back to Madrid, Cordoba, Granada, Seville etc so it's still very much fingers crossed & wait & see time!"
"“I'm still somewhat confused as to why Nerja has been highlighted here“Because it’s the Nerja Forum. There are plenty of discussions about other places elsewhere, e.g. -https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g187…It’s not just nightclubs that have to close btw.Edited: 3:29 pm, August 14, 2020 "
I think you missed the point there Nosoyg. I commented that there had been no such warnings on other CDS forums...just Nerja. That link you posted is only from today!
"So with increased numbers of cases, does this mean that the lockdown worked, but the easing of it didnt, so are we supposed to be in lockdown period. How will anyone build an immunity if in lockdown forever, this virus aint going anywhere. We need to except the rising numbers, and get on with it. If the death toll stays low, then great, perhaps the virus has weakened, or we might be getting immune to it. but locking down every time theres an increase is driving us to economic ruin. We will be not living, just excisting."
"Mitchcornwall, I too am beginning to believe that the virus is possibly weakening. If that is the case, & it carries on doing so, then we may have some light at the end of this horrendous tunnel."
Well said mitch. it wont go away over night. If the huge majority that are now getting it are the young and theres no issue with hospitals etc then just get on with. acting like a drama queen and calling for real lockdowns everytime theres a few new cases is at best stupid and at worse sh!$ stiring with no thought for the ppl who will suffer because of it. We all know why violette. Standing out like a sore thumb comes to mind!
"Herd immunity won't cut it, in UK it's estimated 6% of population has had the virus, & that has resulted in 41k hospital deaths having had a confirmed test. In reality covid deaths are probably well over 50k. If 100% of population gets it (which is what would happen without social distancing & lockdowns) then we could be looking at close to a million deaths just in UK. Same applies in all other countries. Plus there are indicators that any immunity we get from having had it might last just a matter of months. Of course businesses have been badly affected, but there has to be a compromise on life/economy & minimise loss of life until perhaps a vaccine is found. Do you think if no lockdowns had been introduced life & the economy would be normal with people dying on trolleys in car parks & no one at work because everyone if off sick? Would anyone be going to bars in that scenario? There are no easy solutions.As for young less affected people being able to get on with it in isolation, all young people have older relatives, & come into contact with older people in shops, transport etc, so that is a bum theory too.NZ just went into another lockdown with 1 new outbreak & no fatalities. Overreaction? Well they have been open for business a lot longer since March than most countries by taking these tough measures., & I'm sure they will be fully open again soon."
"Well said SoozieGee. You are absolutely right and the government soon realised that herd immunity wasn’t the answer when the hospitals were full of dying people in March. They have made mistakes like all countries but they have looked after everyone through the furlough scheme, social distancing and shielding. This has protected people until hopefully the virus does weaken and we have a vaccine."
"Post 85 says...""We all know why violette. Standing out like a sore thumb comes to mind!""Absolutely Wandering L. As nosoyguri says in another thread....""Not rocket science"". I don't normally wish away time but I have to admit that I'll be happier when the hoards of Spanish holiday makers return to Madrid, Cordoba etc etc at the end of the month. The beaches are rammed today & also with many large groups, one has to wonder if they are all from the same household."
"I have to sympathise with that sentiment, as Menorca is in much the same situation. But for our businesses tourism is absolutely vital. The island cannot live on cheese and avarcas alone."
"Germany has declared all of mainland Spain and the Balearics as a risk area, with testing and quarantine on return (they’re concerned about an upsurge in Bavaria from returning holidaymakers). Expect Torrox Costa to empty pdq. For once the UK has been a bit more proactive, despite the moaning by holidaymakers, although no doubt the eternal Nerja victimhood types think it’s all an evil plot against them.Edited: 9:47 am, August 15, 2020 "
"Proponents of herd immunity will be the first to moan when hospitals anywhere start filling up or impacts on their local community or worse their family.And the ""new converts"" have moaned again and again before about people not social distancing,not wearing masks, lockdown not being strict enough ect, ect, ect now want a free for all.One minute they want quarantines the next they don't all whilst whining about lack of clarity from govt's.Across forums you could not make some of this stuff up.Atb steve"
"Post 90 says ""although no doubt the eternal Nerja victimhood types think it’s all an evil plot against them.""That comes across as a very unpleasant & totally unnecessary comment Nosoyguri. Perhaps you would like to clarify why you need to make such a comment? Post 89, so many places are in the same boat qualityspy, fingers crossed that things improve before many businesses go under?"
