"What is the likelihood of flying to Nice in August with EasyJet? My flight says sold out, but others that day have a few remaining seats. I have final payment due for my accommodation and really don’t know what to do. Will EasyJet just potentially cancel and therefore leave me out of pocket for my payment to my accommodation owner if I am unable to fly? Or would they be still able to get me there on another flight? I am concerned that if I do manage to fly out, that I may not be able to fly back. There seems to be no clear guide anywhere.Really grateful if anyone ahead of me was/is in the same situation and can share their experience/info.Thanks in advance."
"No one could answer that with any accuracy. The fight being sold out has nothing to do with it being canceled or not. Yes, you could potentially be out-of-pocket. It may just be me, but I really don't think it's wise to travel right now. I certainly wouldn't want to lose a lot of money. You'll just have to decide how risk-averse you are."
"As we come out of lockdown and travel ramps up there are going to be much difficult decisions will have to be made. In lockdown it was easy no flight hotels closed so refunds, vouchers, Section 75 chargebacks, travel insurance etc to recover money.Now it’s much more difficult and there will money that we loose because flights are cancelled but hotels are open. We all have to make difficult decisions about how much money we are prepared to loose and how risk adverse we are.For me I’m prepared to loose deposits rather than pay out more money on which will potentially be an inferior holiday. Do I want to go on holiday and socially distance, wear masks, face crowded airports and destinations. I don’t but others are different.Only you can make the choice of what to do.C-19 has been a lesson to book direct with an airline and if booking accommodation book as a package so that you are ATOL protected and if one part is cancelled you are more likely to get a refund.Good luck with your decision.Edited: 8:18 am, June 25, 2020 "
"Does your accommodation provider have a ""get-out"" clause for covid-19?Some accommodation providers have been offering refunds if trips have had to be cancelled due to covid-19, even if the deposit is non-refundable in normal circumstances."
"Not hunky dory if booked with a travel company either smudge99. We are booked on a TUI package to Spain for later this year, but because of things you mention, along with the fact we are in the over 70's group, we do not really want to go.If the holiday goes ahead we could be bound by the terms and conditions which state that changing to a later holiday is treated as cancellation, so we would have to loose full deposit of £500 or perhaps pay the balance and hope we would be allowed to transfer at a later date - but that risks a lot more money lost unless we decide to risk traveling and at our age that is a very big risk. In that case the only way to recoup our cash is if our doctor says we should not travel, so we could claim on insurance, but without other health issues, I do not see that as a likely option. The TUI webite is full of how they are going to keep us safe and is likely the angle they will take, but I am not convinced. They will loose a lot of potential future business from us though if they do take the hard line on that."
"""The fight being sold out has nothing to do with it being canceled or not.""If it is indeed sold out you're right but more likely easyJet has removed the flight for sale in anticipation of cancellation. It's almost impossible to believe an August flight could be really sold out since new bookings must have slowed to almost a complete halt over the last 3-4 months."
">>What is the likelihood of flying to Nice in August with EasyJet? <<50/50>>Will EasyJet just potentially cancel and therefore leave me out of pocket for my payment to my accommodation owner if I am unable to fly?<<Easyjet may cancel the flight, but then you will be entitled to a full refund or the option to change your flight or receive credit from Easyjet. I presume you organised your accommodation independently from Easyjet and therefore the airline has nothing to do with it. If you flight is cancelled you could try contacting your accommodation and asking to cancel without penalty. They may or may not do that. Many have been. If they don't, then you should make a claim against your travel insurance.>>Or would they be still able to get me there on another flight?<<No, Easyjet won't do that>>I am concerned that if I do manage to fly out, that I may not be able to fly back.<<Unlikely. Other airline will be flying to London, or you could take the train. Either way, any costs should be claimed against travel insurance.>>There seems to be no clear guide anywhere.<<Of course, the world has never experienced anything like the times we're going through right now. You can't expect someone to have written a manual on how to get through it."
"I would say it's more likely that your flight is cancelled than not. You can switch your booking for free (apart from difference in fare) if you do it more than 14 days beforehand, or you can wait for easyJet to switch your booking to an available flight. In my experience this will be around 3 weeks out and will incur no additional charge."
"Just to add that I was notified today by email that my flight on the 12th July has been cancelled, we had been travelling hopefully as we had been allowed to complete the online checking process. We were offered a free change, both outward and return journeys, with no additional fees due."
"Re Lex post 5 - an article from Cyprus - https:/…Easyjet claim all flights from London - Cyprus for July are sold out, but then suggests 'sold out' no longer means full and all flights scheduled no longer means they'll operate.A real mish mash of uncertainty if ever I read it . . . . and Cyprus isn't even open to Brits. I'm guessing every route's the same."
