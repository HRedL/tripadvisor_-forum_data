A number of pages are on 'vacation' and British should be British Airways
Tilly41 Great observation! I'm so glad you noticed and made people aware of this very important distinction. You are truly a gem.

Please! When is the airport opening back?
"Sorry, my crystal ball is at the repair shop."
"Tuesday, Debbie.Capt John Harriman, USS Enterprise-B."
"Debbie, which airport is closed? I thought they are all open, just hardly any passenger using them."
"I have been following this Covid-19 development closely from the start. It is absolutely clear that airports have been a central component to the rapid international spread of the pathogen, and that ""fomite"" or hand transmission is a much bigger factor than authorities are saying. I am gob-smacked that airport authorities all over the world were forcing passengers to x-ray security stations where the property trays were not sanitised after every use - even supermarkets around the world were sanitising shopping trolleys for goodness sake! The fact that Trump admin cut funding to TSA for airport janitor services in Jan 2020 a likely factor, but no excuse !! Wake up, before flights ramp up again."
"I have read the latest proposals by airlines supposedly to cope with COVID, its all superficial to make it look good. Social distancing on seating arrangements does not meet government guidelines, the spacing is inadequate and very unsafe. Its not fit for purpose. Anybody on a aircraft without proper distancing are risking their lives."
"Agree that the in-airliner arrangements are not ideal, but the main spread of the pathogen occurred at the x-ray checking lines, where hand contact with the property trays transmitted the virus from asymptomatic carriers to the victims that handled the trays next. TSA and the airport security authorities around the world should have their legs sued off for this. This has been as big a cover-up as the Chinese denials."
"Do you have a source for this information, Lloyd? Be interested to know where you get the cover-up theory from too. Thanks!"
"I had no idea the TSA paid for janitorial services! When I worked at an airport, the airport operator was responsible for htat"
"The information regarding the cutting of funds by Trump for janitor services is freely available online. The airport operator may actually do the cleaning, but the money came from Government. It also revolves around the procedures published by TSA at security stations.... Just at the time when cleaning should have been dramatically increased, it was stupidly cut by people who did not wish ti understand the problem. It was not a new problem anyway, as viruses had been spread through those checking stations for many years - a research paper into previous epidemics at Helsinki makes that clear. All of this information freely available......"
"Regarding the cover up claims;1. The Chinese government certainly 'sat on' the early knowledge of the Wuhan outbreak, allegedly because they did not wish to scare people, but also because they did not wish to lose face over some large party celebrations they had planned, and also the New Year events. They admitted severe repercussions against the doctor who tried to alert the wider public.2. Western governments have been almost as bad as the Chinese in trying to control the narrative - all the while having no real desire to get to the heart of the problem. They did almost nothing in the early stages to trace the mechanisms of the spread or to understand the pathogen in general - they simply assumed that it was SARS all over again, which IT WAS NOT. These are the same 'leaders' who avoid the science of climate change, so their style has not varied."
"""The information regarding the cutting of funds by Trump for janitor services is freely available online""Please provide a link."
"I found this just 40 seconds after starting a new Google search. There is also much more information out there on the mis-steps of our governments - almost all were far too slow to act, and more interested in trying to second-guess scientists that they were in getting to the heart of the issue. As a result, many, many lives have been lost and awful, un-necessary economic damage has been done.https:/…"
I thought this was a thread about flying. Apparently I missed something.
"Hi Carol A,I imagine that you are commenting on my discussion of just how Covid-19 had been allowed to make commercial flying so hazardous, both for the traveler and for the community that they are traveling to.Fact is, that we will not be flying again until the authorities do the job that should be expected of them in making hygiene at airports an absolute priority. This has taken far too long so far, because people have not expressed their concerns."
Certainly not in or out of Australia by July 1. Our infection rates are currently very low and even our government does not want that to change. Opening airports would devastate that situation.
Note that airports opening doesn't mean that anyone can enter the country. While the airports may be open they may restrict inbound travellers to nationals and/or impose a strict 14 day quarantine in a government facility before being allowed out into the public.

I recently saw a divider that took away the middle seat in 3 space traditional aircraft seating - it looked smart Any one know what major airlines will do this separation and how quick can that happen ? That elimates a lot of seats and my recent business travel was very full flights So the obvious how much will prices increase?
"No one can say, moon."
It won't happen in Europe.
"Instead of having the tax payers pay for all the security and cleaning, not President Trump, it aught to be those of us who use the airports, like the airlines, though the cost is passed down as far as it can be. it would be good if you wore disposable gloves and carry some kind of disinfectant, and to have a mask. Instead of blaming others, we need to take responsibility for our own safety, when possible. A security note, I found a nice big box cutter in my carry-on, during a flight."
"@ugtraveldudeAustria - June 15Only to certain EU member states.Same applies to Germany.Airports were never really closed. Borders were closed i.e. entry restricted and ""strings attached"" to enter.Edited: 9:52 am, June 20, 2020 "
"""Airports were never really closed""---My local airport has been closed."
"#23 - I flew ORD to BOS in June on AA who had said that they would keep middle seats open. Well for the most part they did not on the outbound. On the return they filled every seat. As to your question about air rates, we paid $68 each way for two, not per person but for two. We are flying that same carrier and route next month and we each are paying $49 round trip per person. Not kidding. The bag fee ($30) was unchanged.#26 Is there more to that story about the box cutter? Do tell...."

Barbara is no longer with Ta and you Yavuz is promoting your own company.
"Topic: Air Travel from USA to ItalyITravel restrictions change frequently and so it is important to routinely check the Italian embassy and foreign and health ministries for the most up to date information.Here is the link to the Foreign Ministry page:https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…Here is the link to the required entry form. It is available in both Italian and English. It is important to have the most recent version of this form from the ministry and not an outdated one you may find elsewhere.https://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2020/…Tourists from the USA are not currently allowed to travel to Italy. These restrictions will be reviewed at the end of July, at which point they will lift the restriction or possibly extend them to October.However, the form lists many exceptions to the restrictions. For example, spouses and children of Italian citizens, students, and certain kinds of workers. A US spouse of an Italian is allowed to travel just like all other European countries. See the above links for details.A word of caution. Airlines may still block you even when when the restriction don't apply. Their information is sometimes incomplete or entirely wrong. Before buying a ticket from an airline it would be best to call them to verify that the rules they use (which might be different from the actual rules) will allow you to pass. US airlines seem especially bad about blocking people for no valid reason."
