"After being SIP for over 5 months, we decided to take a short trip to Orange County/Laguna. We ended up cancelling due to all the hotel reviews and state of COVID-19 compliance in this area. We want to travel as much as the next person but use common sense, read reviews and follow the most current data re: COVID. It appears that hotels opened too quickly, with limited staffing, dealing with a population that just wants to ""get out of dodge"".Our bigger issue was the lack of cleanliness and social distancing compliance with area hotels and restaurants- they need to understand that by not being compliant with gov't regulations, you will anger customers and lose business just when you want to rebuild and rehire staff. We are in Northern CA and selected a destination 2 hours from home- no flying yet and after searching earnestly we found a small B&B that is following all the rules.It is not worth sacrificing health for a few days at the pool."

">>First, what is SIP?<<SIP is ""shelter in place"", a very common abbreviation for the 'lockdown' or 'self-quarantine' or whatever you choose to call it.>>just seems to push an agenda and be starting chatter in the forum as well as saying, ""Everyone stay away from Laguna""<<But they aren't saying that. They're explaining why they chose not to travel to Orange County/Laguna Beach. The poster even titles their post with their reason for posting... to send a message to restaurants and hotels that they need to do a better job of communicating what they're doing to make visitors feel safe and enforcing those standards.>>You need to add your home location to your profile. <<They say ""We are in Northern CA"". As to where they found to go, that isn't the point of their post and would indeed open them to charges of pushing an agenda. >>Stay home and support your local businesses. <<Except for hotels, apparently. Who is supposed to keep them in business if people are chastised for traveling?>>We all know that every single business in this country that is open has set up protocols...<<Except for the ones that are refusing to obey the state rules, not to mention the ones that aren't enforcing their own protocols. Why criticize someone for questioning businesses about their precautions and refusing to patronize a business that doesn't give a satisfactory answer or has reviews indicating they aren't following best practices? However, I would suggest to the OP that in addition to looking at reviews to determine what businesses are doing, they should also contact the hotel. Reviewers may well have unrealistic expectations or have other issues with a hotel or restaurant.>>they need to understand that by not being compliant with gov't regulations, you will anger customers and lose business just when you want to rebuild and rehire staff.<<Not to mention that making your customers and employees ill is bad business...Edited: 10:00 am, August 04, 2020 "
"The OP’s opinions don’t seem to be founded on any direct experience. And if the criteria included no flying and staying more than two hours from home, no way is OC so close to Northern California. So no reason to bring up OC at all."
Keep up the good work OC. We don't want or need any visitors from NorCal especially since you don't allow any in the Bay Area. Isn't it obvious we're the unprotected class down here.
"I think the OP was originally going take a trip to S. California but after reading reviews and having second thoughts decided on a B&B closer to home. Idk just my guess. S. California doesn’t have the lock on poor housekeeping during Covid. A resort condo here in Aptos was paying untrained teenagers to clean for the 4th of July weekend. I know a teen that made $4,500 in one day. Great for them but I know they received zero training. People are paying $2,000 a night to stay in a condo that hasn’t been properly cleaned. The vacation rentals are worse. In Capitola Village they turn over in two hours. That’s a house. I know someone that used to manage the best house in the Village for a friend and she brought up that they should be doing extra sanitation. Her friend said they would just say that they were doing extra on the VRBO listing but never provided the housekeepers with anything different. Not even bleach because she didn’t trust them to not get it on the carpet. Vacation rentals at least here have zero sanitation guidelines. So whatever this post is aiming at, if you’re traveling bring your own cleaning supplies and give the room or house a once over before you settle in."
"A B&B can follow all the rules to the T, but you're putting your health in the hands of the other guests, too.  Anybody can travel, even someone who suddenly realizes that their tastebuds are shot."
"If I absolutely could not avoid traveling now, Airbnb or other private listings are the last choice I'd make for lodging, for just those reasons. They could be negligent or shoddy, or have employees who are, or could be lying about the precautions they take, and you would have little way of knowing and little recourse if something went wrong.I would pick a hotel or motel from a major chain. Whether it's Marriott or Best Western, they have rules, policies, and probably a list of specific products and procedures for sanitizing their sites. Most chains have COVID info on their websites now. They also have legal, risk management, and building maintenance professionals on their corporate staffs. Their franchisees or managers should be getting regular updates as needed and training their employees. If you have issues or questions, the buck doesn't need to stop with a homeowner looking to make extra money or a mom-and-pop outfit struggling to stay afloat. If problems emerge later and you can't resolve them on-site, you can take it higher.My next choice would be a reputable indie hotel or motel with a proven history of looking after its guests, employees, and facilities. Those might be familiar places that you trust, or word-of-mouth suggestions from people with similar standards to yours. I like indies and have several that I've gone to for years in places where I often go. If you have an ongoing relationship with a small business, they are more likely to treat you right and to try to fix problems without BS'ing you.Other choices could be camping if available or sleeping in your vehicle if you have a safe place to do so. If all else failed, I might consider someone's house where what standards they follow might be anyone's guess."
"I still don't understand how a 'bed pillow' at a hotel is sterilized. Of course, the pillow case can be changed between guests but as we all know, a thin piece of cotton/poly fabric isn't going to prevent the Covid 19 virus (left by one guest) from making its way from the surface of the pillow into the next guest's respiratory tract. Has anyone seen that hotels are sterilizing pillows? I'd bring my own (if I was traveling -- which I'm not)."

"I also sense some gratuitous Laguna Beach bashing since the OP has seemingly no direct experience but is only relying on reviews. That does not mean that the assessment is wrong, just weakly founded. That also applies to the BnB the OP has chosen. That too is based on indirect means. No guarantees of great cleanliness standards there either.Best is to stay home. Highest degree of familiarity with standards of cleanliness. Lowest risk option too."

"I didn't understand much of what the OP said, but what I did, didn't sound accurate."
I have dined out and for the most part they are very good to do COVID-19 checks. I am in particular impressed with those who do the temperature checks. The tables have been spaced out well. The additional clean-up between customers is done. It would be helpful to say where you went to dine - as I doubt you visited all the restaurants there. That is not fair to the restaurant owners that follow good COVID-19 practices.
