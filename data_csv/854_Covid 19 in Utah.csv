"I just saw an article about rising cases in Utah. We are supposed to arrive on Friday. I am not concerned about the areas we will be in (Bryce, Torrey, and Moab mostly), but wondered how possible everything would completely shut down so that we wouldn't get to do everything we had planned?"
"Utah COVID-19 site:https://coronavirus.utah.gov/Recent articles:https://www.ksl.com/article/46768018/utah-ep…https://www.fox13now.com/news/coronavirus/lo…https:/…""“We are quickly getting to a point where the only viable option to manage spread and deaths will be a complete shutdown,” warns a memo that Dr. Angela Dunn, the state epidemiologist, distributed Friday to state and local health officials.""People really are picking a poor time to travel to these remote areas of Utah which have limited hospital facilities. We will not return to the area until either the COVID-19 virus wanes or there are therapeutics and a safe and proven vaccine."
"Thanks, Swim Fan for referencing the report today from our state epidemiologist, Angela Dunn, The significant spike in Covid 19 cases is a reason for concern. @uepianogirl. The state epidemiologist has said that if the daily cases of Covid 19 don’t get below 200 a day, she is recommending that the state go back to the orange phase...fewer businesses and services open and that the Governor mandates face masks for everyone, I don’t mean to be rude or anything like that, but it’s a bit cavalier to think that you don’t need to be concerned about exposure when visiting Bryce, Torrey and Moab. Those places have become very busy, Arches closed down for a period of time last Saturday due to overcrowding. You do need to be concerned. You should practice social distancing and wear face masks when in public places. Be diligent with using hand sanitizer and washing your hands. With this current report fro Dr, Dunn, my husband and I have decided that we are going back to what we were doing in March and April....staying home as much as possible, wearing face masks and gloves when we have to be at the grocery store or in public. I agree with SwimFan. With the current uptick in Covid 19 in Utah, this may not be the best time to visit. But the choice and the risk is yours to take.Edited: 12:35 am, June 23, 2020 "
"Timed out before I could edit again, The state epidemiologist gave July 1 as the date after which she would recommend going back to Orange if the daily case rate doesn’t get below 200.Edited: 12:38 am, June 23, 2020 "
"When I said I wasn't concerned, I didn't mean that we were not taking it seriously. I would actually prefer that masks be required, especially indoors. We ALWAYS wear masks when we go indoors somewhere and we practice social distancing. In fact, the kids usually call out anyone who isn't! LOL. And of course, we are washing our hands and using sanitizer constantly. We will definitely be THOSE people on the plane.I guess what I meant by not being concerned is that our risk there isn't much different than our risk here and the activities aren't all that much different in that most, if not all, will be outdoors and if it feels like there are too many people for our comfort, we will move on. We planned on stocking up on our own food for breakfast, snacks, and lunch, and will probably just do takeout in the evenings for dinner."
"I saw that about the recommendation to go back to Orange, but is that just more precautions taken? Isn't Salt Lake City already in the Orange phase?"
"OP,The risk in you visiting these remote areas is not just to you and your family but the lack of adequate medical facilities as you may transmit COVID19 to the local population as you or your children may be non sympathetic carriers or you may acquire COVID19 while in the airport or on the plane. Just wearing face masks is no guarantee you will not acquire and spread COVID19 to the local population. It is the reason stay at home orders were issued in many places in the USA. Community spread is a real concern in rural Utah. Have you and your family been tested? We really enjoy visiting Utah and may retire there in a few years but cancelled our trip this year because of the pandemic. It really is not the time to take such trip. Utah will be there in the future !Edited: 4:01 am, June 23, 2020 "
"I too will be heading to Utah/Arizona this weekend. Yes, masks on the plane , being outside most of the time and social distancing as much as possible. . Will definitely wear a mask whenever inside including hotels etc and getting take out. Not feeling good about the trip but still gonna go. uepianogirl, sounds like your doing the same."
@uepianogirl - Salt Lake City moved to the Yellow phase a few weeks ago.
"yamon08,OK, got it - there is currently no vaccine or therapeutics for COVID-19 but you just need to vacation in a rural area with limited hospital facilities and there is the potential you are non sympathetic carriers or you may acquire COVID19 while in the airport or on the plane and spread the virus in Utah/Arizona.Edited: 11:31 am, June 23, 2020 "
"I live in Torrey, we have had no cases in the county, we don't want your cases, please don't come here."
"@eupianogirl and @yamon. Plan on wearing face masks just about everywhere when in the national parks. It will be difficult to maintain a social distance when the parks are busy. You will also encounter many people who aren’t wearing masks. With visitors to Utah coming from all over the country right now, many from places that have been hot beds for Corona 19, the risk of exposure is something to be considered every time you are outside your car.I can attest to what Killer Bob said about visiting Torrey. We have been there twice in the past month. In visiting with the owner of the place where we always stay, she said that she had to make the decision to only rent her units to residents of Utah due to so many people calling from places like California and Washington who wanted to stay at her property. It meant that she may take a financial hit. But she didn’t want to run the risk of out of state visitors bringing Covid 19 to the very small town of Torrey and the very small in population county where Torrey is located. Medical services in the area are minimal as they are in all of the small towns near the national parks.And in case either of you think that I am being to harsh in response to the original question, well, the question was asked. I’m not going to sugarcoat my response, Others may disagree with with about this, But Utah is far from being over Covid 19.Edited: 1:53 pm, June 23, 2020 "
"Thanks for the tip about the proprietor not renting to people from out-of-state. I hadn't thought of that.I'm thinking of coming out in the Fall to spend a week in Escalante, Hanksville, or Mexican Hat. I can entertain myself endlessly in remote canyons. I also have to find out if restaurants are open."
"@Danny, We were in Torrey three weeks ago. All the restaurants were open and busy. In Hanksville. Duke’s was open and very busy."
Thank you.
This is interesting. So it seems out of staters can visit Wayne County in the fall as Danny is doing but not this summer? That’s ok then?
I didn’t say out of state visitors couldn’t visit Wayne County this summer. What I said is that there is one owner of a small lodging operation (a five cabin complex) that has made the personal choice to only rent to Utah residents for the time being. No one will stop anyone from entering Wayne county based on the license plate on their vehicle.
Connie just a humor comment. Bob says don’t come but Danny is visiting in the fall. I know you guys plan meet ups late September. That’s the time I’d visit the area. Hopefully my DV trailer trip late October will still happen.
"Connie B - I don't think you're being rude at all...I appreciate the objective and honest answer to my question. I know that the virus is not over. I just want to make sure we are prepared and know what to expect, since each state seems to be handling things differently. We were already planning to travel everywhere with our masks (and even carry them with us on trails in case there are a lot of people) and to have sanitizer with us at all times. We were planning on doing mostly takeout in the evenings anyway, as opposed to dining out, so we are fine with that. And if the governor made masks mandatory....even better in my opinion! (Though I know there will always be people who don't follow the rules) I think they do help when you aren't able to social distance."
@uepianogirl - Thank you for planning on being Covid 19 responsible during your trip to Utah.
"My question is - are locals taking it seriously? I only ask because a few weekends ago we were in Escalante and I was surprised that the locals and workers we saw weren't wearing masks. Our only point of contact was getting gas and five minutes in the store to get a few things (we were wearing masks). But it looked like the restaurants were operating as normal.We also stopped in Page and I was again surprised by the lack of masks, especially considering their proximity to the reservation (which I know is AZ, lol)."
"The locals who live in the larger metro area for the most part are taking Covid 19 seriously and just about everywhere I go, people are wearing masks, I had the same experience as you did when traveling between Bryce and Torrey, Utah last month. The smaller the town, the less I saw mask use by locals. Tihs may be because the small rural areas for the most part have not been impacted with Covid19. I know that Wayne county where Torrey and Capitol Reef are located has had none. So that's probably why small town residents are lax in wearing masks, etc. But with all the people from out of state coming through the region, the Covid situation may change in these small towns."
"Also any town/city that has any college/university will see quite a change, imho. Boulder, here in CO, has seen a spike with the return of students to the Univ. of CO. I almost dread the return of students to CMU here. My experience with teaching very young adults is that they don't really comprehend things the way older adults do since their brains aren't totally matured and they don't have the life experiences that we do. Here in the Grand Junction area (not far from Moab) many folks do not social distance or wear masks. Ugh."
"I live at the South Rim and overall locals have been taking it seriously, but we have seen increased cases in the park. :(. We only had two cases in two months of shut down and have added at least seven more cases in the past few weeks. I think masks will be mandatory soon."
"Wish I had something constructive or positive to add but regretfully not. Sitting in NY totally distraught that our mid September 10 day vacation to the Southwest Utah parks and monuments (national and state) will probably not occur. It has been years since we had experienced some of those other worldly and magnificent red rocks and I am starting to feel their energy draining from my body. Getting older and with some health stuff and when we likely cancel this fall there will be no further planning of a future semi active trip there.I would foolishly try to fly there and back and make the best of it with masks and separation as I had to, but flying this September for my traveling companion, my wife, will almost definitely be outside of her comfort zone. Going without her is not an option. And not that it would necessarily be a problem for us but NY would possibly require a 2 week quarantine on our return from Utah with the current Covid 19 news from that state (as well as area).Thanks ever so much to some very wonderful persons on this forum who have been enormously helpful in the last year or so. Stay well all."
@sasabdued. It's a tough choice. But the right choice. Seems to me that if NY doesn't require quarantine of state residents upon return from traveling to the listed states that the restriction is for naught. Best wishes to you and stay safe.
