"Hi there!Does anyone have any recommendations for a bachelorette party in Wasaga? Any winery/spa options in the area or on the way? Any niche, fun things to do in Wasaga?"
Maybe you should pay attention to the COVID-19 news - you might no have a wedding let alone a party before the wedding.
I think you plan for the future as if it will be cleared up by then and just be sure of cancellation policies wherever you book.
This will be for August
On the way from where?Have you spent any time on the Wasaga Beach or nearby region tourism websites to see what types of things to see and do are available (under normal circumstances)?http://wasagabeachtourism.com/homehttps://brucegreysimcoe.com/home
"If looking for spa or niche ideas look at Collingwood.,For winery ideas you'd need to look at Niagara on the Lake or Prince Edward County. Both also have spa options."
