"easyJet announced the grounding of 95% of its fleet this week. The flight history tracker of my flight scheduled within a week shows that all flights are being cancelled, but mine still is ""on schedule"". Still, there is a disclaimer on easyJet's website claiming that no compensation under EC261 is possible given the extraordinary circumstances of the corona virus (covit19) situation. I believe this is dishonest as they are encouraging people to change their flights. And even issuing vouchers when they cancel flights despite current EC 261 guidelines giving the passengers the right of receiving a full refund - https:/…ip_20_485 .QUESTION: If an airline already knows they are cancelling a flight (press release about ground 95% of its fleet; flight history tracker), but they decided to tell the passengers about this last minute (probably because they are trying to get passengers to panic and reschedule), aren't passengers entitled to compensation under EC261? That's what I comprehend from the recent released guidelines."
No compensation for covid 19 cancellations. If you want a refund for your flight Easyjet will give you one.
"This situation is completely out of every airlines control so I wouldn’t think you are entitled to compensation. Even more so, airlines like EasyJet are currently fighting bankruptcy and having to lay off staff. Many of my colleagues have been let go from big European airlines, many told we are to take unpaid leave for up to a year. To seek compensation in these times is incredibly selfish of you. Please be mindful of how catastrophic this is for aviation."
https:/…106097004
Selfish of me? Do you know what circumstances I am forced to try to fly?!And it is not selfish of the airline to warn customers as soon as they can and not simply just cancel last minute? Let's be real here and drop the drama.
">>> aren't passengers entitled to compensation under EC261? <<<Passengers have never been entitled to compensation if the cause of the cancellation is deemed to be beyond the control of the airline.>>> Let's be real here and drop the drama <<<OK. You go first.Edited: 2:52 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"Reposting the #3 link with an explanation.Here is the official guidance from the European Union re EU261 and Covid-19. ""If passengers face the cancellation of their journey, for example, they can choose between reimbursement of the ticket price or re-routing to reach their final destination at a later stage. At the same time, the guidelines clarify that the current circumstances are “extraordinary”, with the consequence that certain rights – such as compensation in case of flight cancellation less than two weeks from departure date – may not be invoked.""Refund Yes, compensation No.https:/…106097004Edited: 2:55 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"'Selfish of me? Do you know what circumstances I am forced to try to fly?!' Yes, and no.'And it is not selfish of the airline to warn customers as soon as they can and not simply just cancel last minute?' It is not 'selfish'. Business today is not what it was a week ago, and Goldman's 'nobody knows anything' is apt for the situation.+1 to wirewiper's post five."
"I had my flight cancelled today at the last minute with Eastern Airways. I didn’t ask for compensation. I didn’t quote any EU regulations. I demanded absolutely nothing. I politely sat down, I was the only passenger there at the airport, and waited while the check-in agent did her best to re-route me to get me home. I answered her politely and thanked her for all the efforts she was making. Do you know what I got, I got a tiny plane and a pilot to take me home. Another passenger did turn up and so two of us had a private jet home.So quit with the drama, quit with the demands, forget your rights, this is an extraordinary situation, and see what being nice and polite gets you.Jackie"
Grounding 95% means 5% will fly. Maybe you won the lottery. Where is your flight from/to?
Question has already been answered. Put your furstrations to good use and read a book. Stay safe everyone.
A heart-warming story Jackie - well done them! As for the rest of this thread I think Louis has unreasonable expectations so it is a plus one from me to the observations in Posts 2 & 5.
"""If an airline already knows they are cancelling a flight (press release about ground 95% of its fleet; flight history tracker), but they decided to tell the passengers about this last minute (probably because they are trying to get passengers to panic and reschedule), aren't passengers entitled to compensation under EC261?""One thing has nothing at all to do with the other. Just wait until your flight is cancelled and claim a refund."
"I have multiple easy jet flights within the next 5 weeks all of which been cancelled. I only have 1 ec261 form filled. I have since tried fill out a second however the easyJet website is crashing and suggesting an error in the link provided. Any advice, are easyJet likely to give refunds?"
#13.what are you claiming EU261 for.? Do you have a valid reason? I’m not surprised that the EasyJet IT keeps crashing as it must be overloaded.The OP just shows the worst of people in this situation. If everyone was able to claim a refund and EU261 there would not be one European carrier that would survive. Would he then be complaining that there were no airlines to fly with when he wanted his holiday.
"""The OP just shows the worst of people in this situation.""+1"
"Funny how frustrated people are more interested on attacking me when all I am asking is for the airline to cancel the flights in advance instead of doing so in the last minute. No one seems against the fact that airlines are increasing ticket prices and encouraging flight date changes with the passenger paying the ticket price difference. Their change fee waiver is just marketing in the worst of times. In the end, the tax payer will be the one bailing airlines and I am against airline deceptive practices."
"For goodness sake Louis S, the world is in lockdown. Flights are being cancelled right left and centre, operations are cancelled, hungry kids are not being fed, old people (me) are lonely and locked in their homes, the world is upside down. So be patient, wait and see, and do not go for compensation. Millions of us are in the same position and as airline call centres cannot by any stretch of the imagination be thought of as essential then their staff are probably staying safe at home.Jackie"
"Are you entitled to a refund when and if the airline cancels your flight? Yes.Are you entitled to have them cancel it right now and get refunded immediately? No.Are you entitled to compensation over and above the refund? No.Will go get your money back from an airline that may be going bankrupt as a result of this? If they do go bankrupt then eventually you will get a small portion of it, as you will be grouped in with the other debts that the airline has.At least that is my dispassionate understanding of the current situation.Edited: 2:44 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"<< Funny how frustrated people are more interested on attacking me when all I am asking is for the airline to cancel the flights in advance instead of doing so in the last minute >>IMO, Louis is showing more frustration here than anyone else and no, he was not just asking for the airlines to cancel flights in advance - he wants compensation too! Each day airlines are forced to make new decisions on what flights they will have to cancel. Some will be canceled in advance, others will not. Airlines are having to deal with closed borders in addition to drastic decrease in demand. The situation is changing hourly and most people realize it, but apparently not all. Even in the best of times , which these clearly are not, flights can get cancelled at the last minute, so you deal with the situation when it arises. There are hundreds of thousands of people who have had their travel plans disrupted (including me) . Yes, it is frustrating to try to get thru to the airlines, tour companies, and cruise companies , but people need to be patient. Being in customer service in any part of the travel sector has to be the worst job possible right now.As for airlines increasing prices, why should that be a surprise to anyone? They are fighting for their existence and currently are just hemorrhaging money. Having to pay the fare difference has been part of the equation when rebooking a flight long before this. If the flight is less, you lose the difference. Apparently far too many people just don't pay attention to the T&C's of the tickets they bought. While it is not passengers fault that they are in this situation, it's also not the airlines, tour companies, or cruise lines fault either. There will always be someone out there trying to make an extra buck off of a bad situation. Guess we have found one here."
"Please read initial post. All I am asking is for the airline to inform passengers as soon as they know and not wait it out to force passengers to reschedule due to the unknown status of the flight that still says 'scheduled'. EC261 states that compensation is due if passengers are informed of a cancellation less than 14 days. However, it is not due if it is because of extraordinary circumstances. My point was that they know about the extraordinary circumstance at least a month before my flight, yet they are not changing the status of the flight."
"Airlines are being forced to make very difficult decisions these days, and are probably operating with reduced staff. I am not surprised that an airline like easyJet isn't being terribly responsive right now.If you believe that the flight will be cancelled then wait it out - it's not like you are going anywhere any time soon. :-)"
"The airlines do not know in advance, my flight was cancelled yesterday because the airport it was coming from suspended flights, the airline found out just before this flight was about to depart.Every day things are changing and nobody knows what tomorrow will bring.Refunds will happen we all just have to wait.Jackie"
"If all the OP wanted was to be notified in a timely manner if a flight is cancelled, why even bring up the EU261 compensation issue? Again, this situation is changing hourly, so it's highly unlikely that any airline would have predicted they would be in their current position even a month ago. Drastic measures have taken place in the last month, with the US, Canada, EU Countries, and many other countries closing their borders to all but nationals. It takes time and resources to get everything up-to-date - a task I bet none of us would want to be assigned. Until yesterday I could still access my flights for a trip and river cruise on April 6th, even though the trip was canceled a week before.Millions of people are being impacted in so many ways. People need to show a bit or patience and understanding. Things just aren't ""business as usual"" right now.Edited: 3:37 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"""If all the OP wanted was to be notified in a timely manner if a flight is cancelled, why even bring up the EU261 compensation issue?""Again, during regular business, if you're notified less than 14 days that your flight was cancelled, compensation may be due as a consequence. Cause, consequence, get it? I understand things are unstable and changing daily, however, if airlines are going on the press and claiming to be grounding all or most of their flights, I would expect them to notify affected passengers at the same time. That's all."
Amazing how someone who is not interested in compo mentions EU261 over and over again.Jackie
"Louis, if the airlines cancels a huge raft of flight, say 2 months worth there would be thousands clamouring for refunds, rebooks etc. To help the airlines cope if they only start cancelling a week at a time this is a more manageable number of refunds to deal with. It’s a logistical nightmare. Can you understand that?Ryanair explained things very clearly, a surprise for Ryanair! Because of social distancing they have to close desks as people are sitting too close together so both their admin staff and call centre staff are operating on very reduced numbers. You can’t just set up new call centre. I’m guessing all airlines and business who operate in a similar way are having these problems. Can you understand that?Time to get out of you me me bubble and look at the wider picture, this is a global crisis of a scale not seen for a hundred years. Sorry it sounds harsh but sometimes it needs to be to try and make people understand. I don’t think you are doing any good to yourself trying to argue your case."
Easyjet cancelled all flights to spain as of tonight until 1st of May
"""Amazing how someone who is not interested in compo mentions EU261 over and over again.Jackie""Amazing how someone spams a thread with their own unrelated stories and from reading this thread only thinks ""This person only wants cash!""."
"smudge99 - Thanks for the explanation. Perhaps more self service options could help ease the airline's capacity. Explaining myself? I just want to know what is going on with my ticket. You want me to see this situation through the airline's perspective, just understand that there are multiple here. One could easily say theoretically that as per EC261, if airlines know about an extraordinary circumstance beyond the 14 days and do not act prior and they opt to cancel 1 day before the flight (and there are no travel restrictions or bans), it probably was cancelled for commercial reasons. Anyways, this matter is now resolved."

You’ll get a refund in good time just be patient.Jackie"
"""demands and aggression""Jackie, aren't you in the UK? Clearly your issues with EC261 will be resolved with brexit. Contact your public elected representatives about it instead of coming to a public forum where people ask questions and share ideas when you have nothing to add to the discussion."
"It’s EU not EC. At least if you try to be sarcastic get your facts right.Fight for your compensation, good luck with that. You obviously have no idea about what is happening in the world right now and a couple of EasyJet flights are more important than a pandemic which has closed down the world.Jackie"
"Nope, not EU. Regulation EC 261/2004 to be precise. Good riddance!"
"If there's one thing that's come out of this awful deadly mess the world is in, it's that some people still have a massive sense of self importance."
My this thread is getting unpleasant. My feelings are with Smudge (Post 26) on this Louis - especially the final paragraph !
"<< << Again, during regular business, if you're notified less than 14 days that your flight was cancelled, compensation may be due as a consequence. Cause, consequence, get it? >>Oh, I get it but you clearly don't get that this is not REGULAR business. How many times do you need to be told that EU261 is not going to apply if your flight gets cancelled in less than 14 days? You can't now claim that you weren't interest in compensation when you referenced it in the title of your post.<< I just want to know what is going on with my ticket. >>Did I miss the part where you said you had tried to contact Easyjet via phone, email, or social media? Instead you come on here and argue with people who can not tell you anything about the status of your flight. Thank goodness the flight has now been cancelled , as trying to get you to face the reality of the current world-wide situation is like trying to reason with an inanimate object. You have really demonstrated here just how self-centered you are."
"Easyjet have not cancelled our flights to spain on the 5th because they are trying to persuade us to change the flight so they keep our money, its immoral the way they are acting and disgusting to treat customers this way, cancel the damn flights and issue refunds immediately, funny how you have time to persuade customers to change flights but you dont have time to cancel and refund isnt it!Edited: 9:21 am, March 25, 2020 "
Trevor - did easyJet actually tell you the are holding back cancelling to make you change you flight to keep you money? Have you given the situation every airline currently finds itself in a moment's thought? They're simply all firefighting the best and fastest they can with ever changing goalposts as different government issue updated announcements. SWT
"Rubbish, they are even still taking bookings for flights that cant even legally take place, do you think were stupid, how about the £60 million share dividend he just paid himself, bet thats nicely in his bank!"
"I had an Easyjet flight booked for this afternoon that was cancelled a couple of days ago. Cannot manage booking online and cannot get hold of them to sort refundAlso have another flight booked on Friday, not yet cancelled.I suspect I will end up trying to deal through card company - I have kept the notification that full refund is due. (no response from Facebook post or DM via twitter - which is what they are advising others)I have every sympathy for the staff and know this is not their fault but, having previously had a cancelled flight that was managed online and refunded promptly, by making people call for a refund they are increasing their call centre workload unnecessarily."
"<< Rubbish, they are even still taking bookings for flights that cant even legally take place, >>Which route and dates will those be for then, not that there is a law that says airlines can't fly?"

"<< its immoral the way they are acting and disgusting to treat customers this way, cancel the damn flights and issue refunds immediately, >>As has already been explained, the airlines are overwhelmed and are trying to deal with cancellations and refunds on a rolling basis. Most airlines are asking people to not contact them unless their flights are within the next 72 hours. You flights are 11 days away, so they just have not gotten to that group of flights yet. Yes it is frustrating, but the situation is changing hourly, forcing the airlines to make decisions and redo schedules, if they can fly at all. This is a massive undertaking, so people need to show some patience and remember that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the same situation.As for issuing refunds immediately, that's not likely to happen. No airline is sitting on a stockpile of cash that can be doled out as soon as someone wants it. Just like you and most people do, the cash coming in goes out to pay bills and other expenses. Would you have masses of cash to turn over to a bunch of people right now? Do you never try to delay paying a bill until the due date to try to hold onto your money as long as possible or until you have the cash available? The airlines are fighting for their existence, so people need to have a little understanding that it will take time to get refunds to everyone.Edited: 9:52 am, March 25, 2020 "
"@ Trevor L (Post 38) , I have EasyJet flights to Menorca booked for June and have also been offered the option to reschedule them if I prefer to do that now but there was no pressure in their messages so it is NOT a case of ""trying to persuade"" anyone to do anything - just giving an option for those who want to change now. I am waiting for events to unfold and will ""see what happens"" - I cannot change anything and there are more important thins happening around us to be obsessing on not being out of pocket for a few weeks I look at it like this - my money was spent booking my holiday several months ago . You always pay ahead for these things and IF in the normal course of events I WAS going to fly on 2 June I know that I would not be sitting here today feeling resentful because EasyJet and my accommodation provider were sitting on my money. All I have lost at the moment is the hope and expectation of some R&R in Spain in early June that normally kicks in a month or two before I go away. IF (and I am pretty sure it is a case of ""when"" but that is neither here nor there) the holiday gets cancelled then I will pursue how to recoup my losses . In the meantime I am happy to wait and let airlines and travel insurers deal with those who have already been affected and for the airlines to decide themselves when to cancel specific flights. It is not ""immoral"" for the airline to not cancel everything indefinitely to now Trevor - it is simply not to your personal liking. Airlines are haemorrhaging money in lost revenue and they have staff wages to pay and overheads to cover - why would they cancel flights weeks ahead of time unless absolutely forced to ? Yes Easyjet announced a few days ago that it is grounding ""most"" of its fleet but the message on its website is that they ""...will maintain a minimal schedule of essential flights on some routes, mainly out of London. To check the status of your flight, visit Manage Booking....""- how do you know that your flight is not going to be one of those that DOES fly? Nobody is forcing you to rebook but if you want to get your money back you will have to wait until the flight you have seats on is cancelled and it is not your choice when that happens .I would say that if your flights are on 5th (April???) then yes the likelihood is that the flight will probably be cancelled but you cannot insist on anything until it is grounded ."

"Well said in both of your posts Menorca. We had a trip for April 6th cancelled, and were given several options, including a refund, which we were told upfront would take 60-90 days instead of the usual 30 days. We have another trip coming up starting June 30th. At this point we are just waiting it out to see what happens. We have the option of cancelling most of the arrangements w/o penalty and getting vouchers for the flights if the airlines are still offering them. Even with trip insurance, we may not be made whole financially, but that's OK, as many are in a far worse place financially due to job losses (we're retired). Staying healthy is far more important to us than the money right now."

My flight was cancelled, and I have to take another airline which are happily running on the route.Easyjet aren’t justified to cancel flights to save money, but they probably are facing bankruptcy since their margins are lower than other companies.

"Hi BarbPFor once I agree with you totally. Aside from getting information about air travel this, and all other forums I expect, give you an insight into people’s minds, and it is fascinating. The world is on fire and we have no water to put it out and someone is ranting about their loss of a few pounds on a budget flight and how their rights are being violated. How self centred can you be, and I think our friend here may be up for gold.Jackie"

I feel the main question in the OP was answered some time ago and this thread is now creating bad vibes and should be closed.
"I am a UK pensioner whose only income is the state pension, less than £175 a week. Currently I have over £1,000 tied up with BA, £150 with Aerlingus, and just under £60 with EasyJet. But I am not sick, I am not dying, I am okay. There are literally thousands if not millions taking their last laboured breath right now. Yes I need the money but there are lives at stake, the money does not matter. Let those in the call centres self isolate, let them stay away from a crowded office, let them have a chance to live. And that is not dramatic, that is how it is.Jackie"

What does not matter to you may well matter to someone else with different circumstances.Honestly, this thread just needs closing."
"I agree with my thread being closed. This has already been answered a long time ago. EC 261 is the directive airlines and passengers abide by in this case. If you have issues with it, keep them to yourself. How disturbed would you need to be to come on a travel forum and judge people for wanting airlines to follow the law. It is sad and pathetic."

"Amy, they do not have the capacity to answer everyine in a timely fashion way. My case said 28 days processing time. If you are owe a refund, you will get it eventually."
You are spamming the forums!
"Summerlodge did this the other day too, and his posts were rightly removed."
I dropped a note via Help Centre
Me too Tilly.
Why was this thread re-opened? Can you let it go please? Agree to disagree. We're going through a sensitive moment worldwide. Everyone should remain calm in the forums so that we can keep this TRAVEL forum as peaceful as possible. There is no need for the hostility some of you have towards most threads on here.

Another reinvention.
"If easyJet or any other airline has cancelled your flights during this pandemic, you have rights. One of which is a full refund and NOT a voucher. https:/…ip_20_485Edited: 2:00 pm, April 02, 2020 "
Refund issued. And case closed. Hope everyone still waiting receives theirs.

Assuming the cancellation was COVID-19 related you will not be due compensation (as per the EC).
Marco - if you incurred extra costs because of the cancellation why not use your travel insurance (provided of course you bought it before the company started excluding Covd19 issues)
