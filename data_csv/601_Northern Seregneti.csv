"Last year we did a spectacular drive: ArushaTarangireLake ManyaraNgorongoroCentral SerengetiWestern SerengetiBack down to Lake EyasiBack to ArushaThis year we would like to change it up, especially if the migration is currently in North Serengeti. Would anyone have an alternate itinerary to change up our route from last year? We have about 10-12 days. Thanks** sorry i misspelled Serengeti in the title :)Edited: 4:08 pm, August 07, 2020 "
When are you travelling ....what month I mean.
End of August if all goes well
"ArushaTarangire 2 nights- grass is very high but still worth itLake Natron 2 nightsNorthern Serengeti 4 nights you have a long drive and maybe two locations I would see what is open and what TO's offerSeronera 2 nightsNgorongoro 1 nightI picked 11 nights but you could take one off the North or central.Did you consider Selous and Ruaha for a fly in safari 5 nights each location I have no information what is open there now with covid-19 but if the migration is of interest then go North I would also consider leaving off Tarangire and going to the Eastern Serengeti if cats are of a interest August is great for the area around Turner Springs.Lake Natron is a really beautiful location different I think and far better than Eyasi, more wildlife, a waterfall walk, stay close to a Masai village, see the early man footprint area and really get a feel for the stone age history that area is like a trip back 10,000 years except for you phones bikes and the 4 x 4's."
"Hi And you can climb the holy mountain - volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai ""mountain of god"" at lake Natron"
Western kilimanjaro at isiya wildlife management at least 2 nightsIsiya to Lake Natron 2 nightsLake Natron to kongatende area at least 3 nightKongatende area to central Serengeti 2 night Central Serengeti to ngorongoro 1 nightNgorongoro crater to Arusha Arusha national park walking safari with caonenig tour in Lake momella
"All the above advises sound great, I can just add ... if you loves hiking you can include in your itinerary a Ngorongoro highland hiking tour including a visit to Olmoti and Embakaai crater down to Lake Natron. As Achnab said, at lake Natron you can also hike the Oldonyo lengai mountain.Karibu Tanzania,"
"I was in Western Serengeti mid-July and there was not one single animal. Not sure if it’ll change by August end, but based on what I saw (or rather didn’t see) I wouldn’t waste time there. Seronera was the most eventful part in terms of game drive. Northern Serengeti- do check with your TO if those river crossings are doable at the moment (back in July there’re still impossible to cross due to excessive rains during the rainy season - local people say it’s especially bad this year - information from the ranger, not just a TO). Good if it’s doable now, but I’d prepare for the worst case scenario- having to fly instead of drive).Best of luck with your safari!"

"Hi Lisa L,I am heading to the Lamai Wedge, northern Serengeti tomorrow and I will be staying very close to the Mara River. Three days ago, I was about 5 miles north of this area but in Kenya in the Masai Mara. On August 6, in an area called Lookout , I saw 25,000+ wildebeest doing a river crossings from roughly 130pm to 330pm. The video I shot is on Serian's Facebook page and several others. It was epic and there were six cars on each side of the river! The Mara was devoid of tourism and I saw less then 40 vehicles in 3 full days. I will report back on what I see in the northern Serengeti in a few days when I get wifi. I never recommend driving to that area. Fly on Auric or Coastal Air and do a game drive package at one of the tented camps up there. I ALMOST was going to visit the eastern Serengeti on this trip at Ehlane Plains (reasonable cost) or Namiri Plains (high spec). As Noexpert says, this area will be great too. Perhaps a drive up north will not be so bad if you put eastern Serengeti between the Crater and the north. I recommend going back to the Crater just to enjoy it sans crowds.Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond"
@craig Beal let us know if the bridge of kongatende to lamai is already fit it. I let there there was still fitting and was not able to cross mara river to go north part in lamai area.Please drop update news. At kongatende airstrip there is free wifi
Hi Craigit would be nice if you can update us on whether you were asked for the Covid-19 certificate.
"Hello SafariEyes - I have confirmed with multiple sources including Nomad and Serian that the bridge is still out and the only way to Lamai from Kogatende is by air. Hi noexpert - when I arrived at Namanga today, the first window I had to visit was for Tanzania health. They asked me to fill out a health questionnaire. I already had a copy. Then they asked me for my yellow fever card, passport and covid test results. I told them that ""Travel Advisory #5"" dates August 5 said it was not required but the man insisted. I gave them the results of my first covid test which I had taken on July 24 and received on July 26. He said it was too old. Then I gave him my results (on my phone) of the test I took at took at AMREF in Nairobi. I took the test on Aug 5 and the results were received on Aug 6. He let me in.I hope this helps.Craig Beal - owner - Travel BeyondEdited: 11:27 am, August 09, 2020 "
@Craig I'm wondering why you needed a yellow fever certificate. When we went it wasn't required of us - is it because of your past travels? Thanks
"@Lisa, Kenya is listed among countries with risk of yellow fever transmission by WHO, so by coming into Tanzania from Kenya, they would generally require a proof of YF vaccination."
Hi Lisa L - I agree with 14. I don't think you can travel from Kenya to any other country in Africa without one.Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond
Thanks Craig great info.
