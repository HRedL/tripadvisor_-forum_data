"I have a trip scheduled later this month to visit the island. Any indication of travel restrictions? Has the island become less congested with tourists lately? This could be a good or bad thing. Less people, less lines. Trying not to be overly paranoid about travel. Thanks"
"There are no reported cases as yet. I'd be more concerned about the travel getting here -- being in crowded airports, crowded planes and the like. No doubt, as more cases appear in the US, that less people will be travelling. Of course, that's a big hit for us economically, but it also means less possibility of having the virus brought to the Bahamas. Obviously, safety is paramount. Best to keep an eye on things and make a decision closer to your trip. Some airlines are already allowing travellers to change their reservations."
"Given that this is getting into peak ""spring break"" season, I wouldn't expect much change in tourists flying to the island, however there may be a drop-off in cruise passengers in port as people change their mind about spending days at sea aboard a floating petri dish.In Mid-February, Bahamas put in place a total ban on incoming travelers who had been to China in the 20 days before arrival.Bahamas recently announced “We have four persons quarantined due to exposure on an Air Canada flight"", but as of March 2nd, NO confirmed cases of COVID-19."
Thanks for the feedback.I'll keep an eye on the events as they unfold and make a decision soon. I'm still leaning towards the visit as most news stations report that travel is fine for now.
Yes I also will be traveling to Bahamas on the 13th of this month I’m deciding if I should cancel the trip or not I’m nervous about getting back into the US afterwards what are you screening policies in entering Bahamas how have they changed since the corona virus outbreak
We are going three days after you. Not overly concerned
What’s the feeling about going to the Atlantis water park? Chlorine kills all? LOL
I have not heard any news of the virus in the Bahamas but my girlfriends company just cancelled a Presidents Club retreat citing news of the virus reported in the Bahamas.
Yes there are no cases of the coronavirus yet in the Bahamas but 22 people are quarantined and possibly might be infected
Where did you see that 22 were detained? I cannot find that information. Were they cruise ship passengers?
"I found a link that says four people were quarantined in February following exposure to someone who tested positive with virus on a flight with Air Canada .https://ewnews.com/coronavirus-four-bahamian…Edited: 11:36 am, March 04, 2020 "
"Iceblue 75, I was thinking the same. Less lines at the water park. I hope they add just a little more chlorine to the pools lol"
"I'd be more concerned about Dengue fever. I hear that is creeping up. But also, some other poster, DUSTY?, also says Atlantis sprays the crap out of the place and all 4 times i've been there have never seen a mosquito."
I'm heading to Freeport on the ferry from Ft Lauderdale on Mar 14. There is one line in an article on ewnews.com stating that 22 people have been quarantined in the Bahamas. I haven't seen any more info.
"I would be more concerned with the flu then Coronavirus!Over 19 million people have been sick with the flu, over 180,000 have been hospitalized and 10,000 people have died so far this year yet everyone is freaking out over this Just wash your hands and enjoy your vacation"
"My trip is in May. If I were travelling now, I think I would want to be extra careful in the crowded places by lots of hand washing, and maybe wearing a protective mask around the airports."
If I get stuck in the Bahamas I would be a happy camper
Any new updates on the virus there ? Suppose to be coming in on Friday from US. At we least have a direct flight bringing a lot of hand sanitizer Thanks

"Traveling tomorrow to the Bahamas , paradise Island I hope all will be ok."
"@ W S, Let us know how it goes. Wishing you the best and I hope everyone stays healthy. We've been tracking the movement of the virus and I'm still very set on going towards the end of March. I personally don't mind the risk. I hardly ever get sick (fingers crossed), I've had the flu before so I know what to expect but my son would be travelling with me and I DO NOT want to travel with a cranky sick kid."
I am planning to travel in end of March as well. I am trying to be on top of news and don’t see any reported cases online but leaning towards the travel as of now.
"I am a college student and theres a big group of kids from my university visiting the Bahamas at the end of the month, and I hope we will be able to go. Our parents are concerned but most people think we will be okay."
Following this topic as we're headed to Atlantis later this month.
"As of this morning, March 5, while there are people in quarantine, the Bahamas has no confirmed cases of Coronavirus. Hoping it stays that way--we are heading there March 10. Bringing lots of antibacterial wipes for the plane trip, as we are more concerned about that. :-0"
We just got off a cruise from Bahamas. No issues at all. Everything was normal. Also visited Paradise Island. We had a great time.
We fly from the UK on 3rd April and following news & posts with caution.It is the cruise ships coming in all the time that worry me more ! We are staying at Atlantis where they come in for the day.There isn't anyone that can predict its spread so we are all just hoping for the best.
The thing is make sure you're not taking the virus there. There are no cases! if you are sick its best to stay home
I think that is pretty obvious that you don’t go anywhere if you are sick !
We are traveling next week. Fingers crossed.
22 people have been quarantined and 6 remain so. https://ewnews.com/moderate-to-high-risk-of-…
"Somewhat encouraging that 2 days ago they announced they NOW have a lab to diagnose COVINE-19, BUT how many may be undiagnosed? https:/…"
"RE: post above ^ COVID-19"""
"Unfortunately, I'll be rescheduling my March trip to May. My company is encouraging employees to limit international travel. There was also a mention that if travel occurs during Spring Break, one should voluntarily self quarantine upon return. Given the restraints, I think its best that I postpone our trip until this all blows over. Wishing everyone safe travels. Stay healthy.Edited: 9:14 am, March 06, 2020 "
"As of March 6, the Bahamas has no confirmed cases of COVID-19. We do have the means and ability to test for suspected cases. As of this morning, our travel restrictions have been expanded to include Italy, Iran, and South Korea. China has already been on the list for some weeks now. In short, anyone who has visited any of these countries within the past 20 days will be denied entry into the Bahamas. There is talk about restrictions on cruise ships, but this has not been made official. Obviously, with the vast majority of our visitors coming from the USA, and the increasing number of cases there, we may have to make the tough determination if things get much worse. Lines have been longer at the airport immigration counters, as visitors are being screened and questions asked of where they have travelled recently, so please be patient as we do our best in keeping the Bahamas free of the virus.Edited: 9:26 am, March 06, 2020 "
"Hi! We are supposed to travel March 19th to Nassau, Baha Mar and be there for 3 nights. I think my concern is more about becoming quarantined there for a period of time. Does Baha Mar also get the cruise ship crowds that come in to Nassau?Thank you!"
"03/06/2020Covid-19. Update : In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, local authorities have ordered a ban on entry to the Bahamas for all passengers, both airline and cruise, non-residents, who have visited high-countries in the last 20 days risk, such as Italy, China, Iran or South Korea. Citizens and residents of the Bahamas returning from these countries will be subject to quarantine for a maximum of 14 days. Non-residents from these countries who are already traveling to the Bahamas will be subject to the same protocol provided for citizens and residents."
"BKtravelgal, Baha Mar typically doesn't see a lot of cruise ship visitors, as they don't offer day passes. That's not to say some might venture that way to see the casino or to check out the place. As for being quarantined -- unless you are showing symptoms of a fever, cough or other flu-like symptoms, you're unlikely to need quarantine. They are doing a more thorough job of screening passengers at Bahamas Immigration at the airports - and you may be asked if you've travelled to Italy, China, South Korea or Iran within the past 20 days. If you're sick, then please don't travel!"
I am also concerned about this. Any response on getting back into the US ?
"ThirdEye713, in your post #33, you say your company has suggested to avoid international travel -- which makes sense to places that have been infected with COVID-19. The Bahamas has no cases as of this date! I'd be more concerned with domestic travel within the United States where the COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly. Postponing your trip makes sense by not travelling through crowded airports and planes."
We are coming from the US in late March. Do you think we will be alright?
How many people are in quarantine and how many people have been tested in the Bahamas?
Hi Dusty-traveller- I am more concerned about others having it while there and being stuck in a hotel room for 14 days. I am not sure if you saw the story in the Canary Islands. I definitely would not travel if I wasn't feeling well! Thanks!
Going on March 15 for one week. Hope it will be okay.
I’m going on 17th of March as well for a wedding
"@Dusty Traveller Yes, the main concerns come from our connecting flight in Florida, airports, being on a plane, and exposure to tourists. I think the island itself is fine but getting there and getting back is the issue."
My family has plans to travel to Atlantis at the end of March. I'm nervous but we don't want to cancel the trip!
I would also like to know this! I've heard that there aren't any confirmed cases but I'm very worried about travelling in general. We are supposed to go to Atlantis on 3/25.
"We are also going this month, arriving on 3/25. Where are you travelling from? Are you nervous?! I'm a little freaked out but my family does not want to cancel."
"Exactly! Our lay over is in ATL, which is an international airport. My logic tells me, we can wear proper masks and be diligent about hygiene and we will be fine. However, the scary part of my mind says that it only takes one infected person on the plane to get all of us sick. It really is a mess and the media is NOT helping with all of their doom reporting! The number is cases is quite low and they're in clusters, suggesting the spread shouldn't get out of control. I don't know, I'm all over the place with this but the airport is definitely an area of concern!"
"Regarding the number of people in QUARANTINE..A BAHAMIAN returning to the country from China on Thursday was placed in quarantine bringing the total number in isolation to three, as cases of COVID-19 increase around the world.http://www.tribune242.com/news/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-three-quarantine/"
"I was planning a trip to Harbour island around July/August, should I cancel the trip?"
Going in April to Atlantis. I really don't want to cancel. Travel insurance won't refund you for fear of getting sick (didn't get the cancel for any reason insurance). Hoping that exceptions would be made in these times should the need be to cancel. Anyone know if Atlantis is taking extra precautions?
What I’m hearing Is as the virus spreads the US/Canada will stop exporting to the Bahamas. Which would mean no incoming food. The Bahamas doesn’t produce much on their own correct?

Well with that response is another reason I’d never stay at Atlantis....I’d report that response to higher up management
"I’m going to the Bahamas on a cruise the end of the month. As of now, I’m still traveling. However, I will be monitoring as it gets closer."
We are traveling to Atlantis the 1st of June. We've been planning this trip since last July. I really hope we don't have to cancel. Hopefully by then things will have improved. I wish everyone safe travels and stay healthy.

"Really hoping to get updates on this thread with your travel experiences in these weeks, we are supposed to travel in month end. Thank you !"
I read that they do have Cases now linked to a Canadian flight.
"https://ewnews.com/coronavirus-four-bahamian…From feb 25, should be out of self isolation or quarantine soon"
I am traveling to Freeport on the ferry from Ft Lauderdale. As of now neither the ferry nor the accommodations are offering refunds or waivers. I am flying from JFK to FTL and Delta is offering waivers for changing the flight. I am watching the news daily. I hope that if the Bahamas close their borders to people I find out before I get on the plane.

https://ewnews.com/hotel-bookings-slowed-but…
Any updates about this? I have a trip planned for the last week of March. Need to make a decision by the end of this week.
The concern is more about quarantine than getting sick. Two weeks is a long time ;)
As of now the only restrictions are if you have traveled to a country where there is an outbreak. We are traveling there next week and our plan is to stay as healthy as possible and avoid quarantine.
Please let me know what u decide and how it goes. I have Disney Cruise set for April and I’m not sure what to so either!
"Problem is, you can not show symptoms and still transfer the virus"
"Not sure about the island, but I would advise going on cruise ships as the chances of being quarantined are much higher"
"Just reached Paradise Island today. Everything seems good here. Immigration at airport did ask if we had recently been to italy, china or s.korea...note that they didn’t ask about iran and it was almost a rhetoric question like she wasn’t really expecting to hear yes as a response. But life here doesn’t seem affected by the coronavirus craziness affecting the world. Not sure if that’s a good thing or bad."
If you have been to Italy in the last 20 days there is an electronic record of your travel attached to your passport. You will be isolated and returned to your country of origin.
I have a comprised immune system should I cancel my trip to the Bahamas April third
"<< ""I have a comprised immune system should I cancel my trip to the Bahamas April third"" >>Asking anonymous strangers on a travel chat-board probably not the best approach to making an informed decision on this topic."

https://ewnews.com/coronavirus-threat-level-…
"I just spoke with Atlantis. They are denying day pass access to all cruise passengers. The island is currently denying access to any travellers coming from China, Italy, South Korea, and Iran."
I was wondering that also. I am going in may so I have time. My friends daughter is stranded in Italy. She can't get out
We arrive on Thursday and we have been monitoring the situation closely. I too spoke with Atlantis and the agent I spoke with said cruise passengers were being allowed access to day passes. I cannot find any official statement confirming that they are being denied. Does anyone know if this is true?
Only 50 test kits are available with more on order. https://ewnews.com/50-coronavirus-tests-in-c…
Called again and now they said cruise passengers are allowed in. Lots of miscommunication.
"I figured if there would have been something in the news if that was the case.Edited: 2:21 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"<, All guests of a hotel get quarantined if there is even one case of the virus either pending confirmation or confirmed. Since symptoms take days to appear it does make sense - no one would really know if they have it or not>>Windvalley, what was incorrect? While what you say sounds wonderful, the reality is that there's no way a hotel, say like Atlantis Royal Towers, can be quarantined with all guests. People are coming and going on a daily basis, so there'd be no realistic means of containment. It sounds like a great idea, but the reality is very different! Honestly, chances are that the virus is already here. There's very little screening being done at the airport or posts beyond perfunctory questions if they've been to Italy, China, South Korea and Iran. How many tests have actually been done here? Reports seem to suggest the Bahamas government has yet to do any testing. If this is correct, then all bets are off.Edited: 6:23 pm, March 10, 2020 "
anyone hear anything new? We are set to go March 21 for a week.
They did not quarantine those guest staying at the resort in Dominican Republic after one guest tested positive. I would guess that they would test/isolate any one showing symptoms at Atlantis but cannot see how they would quarantine the entire complex. Maldives did lockdown the hotel affected there but much smaller.Does anyone know of other resorts (not cruises) that are going into lockdown when a guest/staff test positive?
"All I know is that they are still letting in passengers from cruises, which seems ridiculous. They should at minimum close the resort off to outsiders. No day passes should be allowed."
"Agree but I am sure the virus is already there as it is here in the US, they just have not tested for it.Anyone there know if the numbers are down or does it seem like as many guest as a usual Spring break? Does it seem like there are less cruise passengers on site? My son and I are still coming Thursday..."
"Let me know when you find out lol. Our trip is scheduled for April..Edited: 8:18 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"i am in the same situation, supposed to leave Monday....can not decide if I should go or not. the messaging on the news is all over the place."
how was it???
Greeters working at Port Everglade test positive for COVID-19. https:/…There are more articles about this.
"It is Shocking that Atlantis, being such a reputable resort is allowing cruise passengers in on a day pass. We are thinking of cancelling for that reason alone."
"If you are thinking of canceling and call and let them know of your concerns, in addition to others with the same concerns..... Perhaps they will take a serious look at allowing cruise ship passengers. We have the same concerns and are also considering canceling."
"I'm flying out on the 14th...not concerned about getting there or back. I'm curious, what are your concerns? Getting COVID-19?"
"Utah is reporting a second case. The woman had just returned from a trip that went through Nevada, Florida, and then on to the Bahamas. They did not say where in the Bahamas."
Seems like the concern is the airports and that atlantis is letting in all cruise ship passengers on day passes.
Ughhh we are scheduled to go March 28th Worried :(
First week of April for us. Maybe they won't let in cruise passengers by then but I called today and they are very relaxed about it all. I'm sure many people are cancelling trips.
Scheduled to fly in on 3/29 & go directly to a sailboat for private 6 day cruise with friends... Have to take public transportation (taxi's) from airport to sailboat. Fairly limited contact with the masses...does this sound safe?
Did you read on this site or another where someone called the Atlantis about being in Italy then to Atlantis..they were told by management to lie and not say anything to immigration.Shady on Atlantis part
"That's awful. We are supposed to go in a few weeks and I am afraid that we will end up getting stuck there. Does anyone know if they could quarantine the resort and if so, would we be financially liable for being held there? Thanks"
That's my concern to.. supposed to be there next week
"Post #112 -- no, Atlantis is far too big a resort to have the entire place quarantined - and certainly if you were isolated, why would you be responsible for the costs? There are so many coming and going each day, as well as non-registered guests visiting the resort, there would be absolutely no realistic way of even attempting to isolate those who may (and that's a huge may) have had contact with someone who might show up as being infected. It's just not realistic."
Heading over tomorrow to Bimini from Florida for a week. Airline already delayed our flight 5 hours. I just want to get over there. Not worried about delayed return and there aren’t really the crowds there like in Nassau.
And they are now in Bahamas?
and slides remain open??
Hoping to see information from someone who's there right now! Know any current guests posting anything /anywhere from Atlantis?
"Replying to #117, 118 and 119.We are here right now. Been here since monday. Everything is running as usual. Spring break parties on, all restaurants, slides, everything is openEdited: 11:08 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I meant We are in the Atlantis since monday...
"We booked a non-refundable room at the Atlantis for the week of 3/20. Does the policy change with the recent WHO declaration of a global pandemic. Our airline is offering free change fees and was wondering if the hotel would do something similar. Not looking for a refund- only to push the date as the concern of potentially getting stuck out there (with the recent European travel restrictions into the US) seems to be increasing by the day.Edited: 2:08 am, March 12, 2020 "
To anyone there right now. Are the cruise ship passengers allowed in with a day pass?
Yes they are
"I am in the same boat! Non refundable rate/deposit paid. The resort posted a travel update last night on the homepage of their website that acknowledges change/cancellations but it wasn’t clear if it applies to all rates.... Considering calling them to inquire todayEdited: 6:42 am, March 12, 2020 "
Spoke to them last night. For non refundable rate they will not refund. You can make a change for another date and must pay the difference in the room price and the flight fares if booked directly through them. We will be rebooking for christmas and it’s double the price right now. You can go within a year is what they told me last night. They have no plans for not allowing in cruise passengers.
Any updates on this subject? We are supposed to fly through Miami to the Bahamas on March 20. Am wondering if the country will start not accepting passengers from the US as the virus affects more and more of the US. Thanks for any input or information that anyone has!
Let us know how you make out. We have trip scheduled to Bahamas march 22.
Let us know how you made out. We have trip still planned march 22 to Bahamas all inclusive hotel
How many cases are there in Nassau Bahamas
"I am not sure. I have been reading the Bahamas newspaper daily on line. Still reporting no confirmed cases. Not sure how they are preventing people on cruise ships coming over to go into island and shop, beach and gamble."
"According to the Bahamas government they have no confirmed cases as yet. However, when asked how many tests they have done, we cannot get a straight answer. Honestly, as a Bahamian living in New Providence, I'd be just as happy if the Bahamas government stopped all cruise ships and flights from the US -- given that there are increasingly large numbers of those infected already and will no doubt those number will continue to rise. We are an island -- so at least have the ability to control comings and goings. But it would effectively kill our tourism industry. But the public heath is far more important, imho!"
"Hi, I too will be traveling to Paradise Island. I would like to know if they have responded to you in private or have your received any responses."
Our group of 20 people are supposed to fly to Nassau from Minneapolis on Saturday. Planning on staying at Atlantis for a week. About half of us are wanting to reschedule and the other half still want to go. Most of the worry is getting back in the US. So much has happened in the last 24 hours. Who knows what might go down in a week.
"Granted this article is 10 days old, but as of that date, they only had 50 tests available.https://ewnews.com/50-coronavirus-tests-in-c…"
"No have not contacted hotel. We have till 18th to cancel from travel agent. Like the other person said, a lot has happened in last 24 hours here in the states. Day to day to see how week unfolds. Are you still planning on going?"
"And if you get sick while you are there, good luck... (from local news) Patient abandoned at local health clinic during virus scare.We'll cancel at this point.https://ewnews.com/patient-abandoned-at-clin…"
"Hi,Since your arrival how are things? I will be there next week."
Believe me.....You DO NOT want to be stuck in the hospital in Nassau!!Princess Margaret....you go in but most dont come out alive. This is a 3rd world healthcare system. Lived there for many years and many relatives that have died in that hospital. Think twice
We are going March 22. Day to day right now. We are still planning. But everyone is in panic all over world.What about you? You still going?
"#139, Frances, what nonsense! While PMH is certainly lacking in many ways, your statement that ""most don't come out alive"" is false and inflammatory. Shame on you! There are 3 other private hospitals on New Providence that are top notch, especially Doctor's Hospital. So stop making false and misleading statements."
what resort was this?
I believe everyone should be concerned after reading this article from yesterday which was already shared in this thread. https://ewnews.com/patient-abandoned-at-clin…
Likely cancelling. Supposed to go easter weekend
supposed to go t o four seasons march 21 to 28 non refundable but was going for son's senior trip not sure what to do if they credit me i would change to another time
No shame on you Dusty!!I have been there just recently. So dont give me this crapFace reality.....Nassau is so far behind the times.If you can afford to go to Doctors Hospital or Lyford Cay.....good for you.
We are heading to Atlantis on the 14th. Happy to report back but we have no intentions of cancelling. Lots of hand washing and trying to keep a distance as well as being aware of those coughing and ensuring we are checking ourselves is as good a measure as any regardless of where you reside. Looking forward to fun in the sun!
"Hi! We are heading there on 3/23 - haven't cancelled yet. It will be my husband and two kids ( 5 & 2). I'm less concerned with us getting sick while we are there, however two things I am concerned about 1. getting back home /travel restrictions while we are there 2. Getting back home and having to self quarantine. Anyone else traveling to Bahamas in the next few weeks, do you plan on self quarantining when you get back home?"
BREAKING NEWS!  https://ewnews.com/coronavirus-infected-crui…
"PLEASE DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE PEOPLE. Search Bahamas' news, Facebook ""Bahamas' News and Events"" ""This Week"" videos. The Bahamian government just began organizing a defense plan for COVID-19 within the last 2 days. They announce that they now have 400 test kits (from various sources) up from 50 last week,and after sending 100 faulty ones back to Asia. Just now had a press conference that they tested an American with symptoms and the test came back negative. Have seen no news of any others being tested so this may be the first test done in Nassau."
"As of March 10th, 2 hospitals in Nassau being set up to treat confirmed cases of virus. Local Princess Margaret Hospital, 6 beds; Defense Force Base, 20 beds (with ICU). You will go wherever they send you."
"Good news from my recent 'BREAKING NEWS"" post. Bahamas is not allowing the cruise ship with the confirmed cases of Coronavirus to dock.https://twitter.com/KyleWalkine/status/1238196211267575808/photo/1My family has cancelled their trip to Nassau so I will no longer be following this topic. Good luck everyone."
I’m headed to Exuma next month to get married. We are mildly concerned but still planning to go. Feeling a little uneasy though and it’s my wedding!
"Hi there, I was just curious if you are still heading to Bahamas tomorrow. I’m supposed to by leaving to go there on Sunday with a friend and am very unsure as to what to do."
"My family is scheduled to arrive in Nassau from Tennessee on Sunday. We are totally on the fence whether we should go or not. We are staying at a private home and NOT a resort, but are nervous about a travel ban being put in place while we are there. Any suggestions would be helpful."
"Post 146 -- Frances, you're delusional. Sorry, I stand by my earlier comments. I live here and know many local doctors and nurses who are regularly being poached by American hospitals -- if they were do damn bad, why? We are a nation of 400k, so comparing our health system to large more developed countries is idiotic and unrealistic. Yes, Doctors and Lyford are both private hospitals, but they are available to everyone -- not just the rich. So enough with your nonsense! You should know better. While it's clear you've had issues with PMH, and there are many issues with PMH -- no dispute there, but to categorically state that << most people don't leave alive>> is blatantly false and inflammatory. Period. Shame on YOU!"
As of now I’m still going tomorrow
"We are still going next week, can't find a solid reason not to go. Was hoping others would chime in here.Edited: 8:37 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"We're flying to Nassau and then to Eleuthera the first week of April. Fingers crossed domestic flights are still going to Nassau. And hey - if we were stranded on Eleuthera for an extra week or two, no complaints here!Edited: 8:47 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"We were booked to arrive on Monday (16th) staying at The Royal Towers, travelling on WestJet and just cancelled and received a FULL refund (thank you WestJet!!)I'm more concerned with all of the activities I booked and pre-paid for such as the cabana rentals and the Dolphin Cay activities. Ughhh I hope they have a heart!!"
Hi there! I’m supposed to be heading to Bahamas on the 15th as well. Wondering if you are still going?
Still going

I am traveling March 18 to Nassau hopefully will be ok need something positive
I am scheduled to arrive at Atlantis on the 22nd. The only concern I have is the cruise ship day passes.
"I thought the same, we are suppose to arrive on the 22 of March. Really what is the difference between all the different people coming from the states all over the world and country flying into Bahamas. Same risk as people coming from the boat on shore. Looks like we are cancelling at this point."
"Cindy, not to argue your point since my family and I are supposed to travel in on Sunday morning, but my thinking was that the cruise ships represent an extended period of time with a lot of people in a closed environment. It seems that is even more at risk than individuals in an airplane for two hours or three hours flying to the Bahamas. Admittedly, it’s a tricky question. We are on the fence about whether we will go but are leaning towards still heading out on Sunday morning. Good luck to you."
"Hi Tim,No worries , I didn't take your response wrong way. I get that with the plane only 2 hours . Ship most likely with others for a few days longer. My thought process is people may already have the virus and not know it from all over. They say it is going to peak over the next few weeks and spread. Just another way I am thinking of it. So much here and all over US a lot is shut down currently. I would of loved to go. Enjoy your trip."
"You saying most people don’t come out of a certain hospital alive is a ridiculous statement. Cool, you have experience going there and saw mice and roaches. Share that info instead of your original statement, which is just plain false information. Dusty is it attacking you. You’re just too sensitive to be be spewing false information on public forums."
"Cindy, agree with that point. I misunderstood the concern to be about whether persons coming off of airplanes are just as infectious as those coming off cruise ships. I do tend to think there is validity that cruise ships are more infectious places than airplanes, but to your point, that says nothing about the health status of individuals before they enter either of those. Final note — I was not actually the poster before you. Mine was a new response to your note. I can see how my response could have been misleading, however."
Does anyone know if you get there and get sick will you be able to get back to the US?
"I assume you would have to be quarantined, but I'm sure you would be able to get back! I'm supposed to arrive the 24th and still plan on goingEdited: 1:42 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"As most of you try to decide if to visit the Bahamas or if to cancel your trips, let me add one more perspective no one seems to be considering --400,000 of us LIVE here. Many of us depend on your tourism dollars and are grateful for them and for the chance to share our beauty, sun, sand and sea with you, but PLEASE consider that if you are coming from an area in the US or elsewhere that is infected with the COVID-19 virus, please think twice about BRINGING it with you. So as you make your decisions about travelling, please be consider of those you are visiting! Thanks!Edited: 2:18 pm, March 13, 2020 "
So are you all restricting people from the US?
"@SteveM - Your worried about ""cruise ship day passes""? Really? Why, because the assumption is there may be a c19 carrier visiting the island for a couple hours? Your travelling to Atlantis so how are you getting to the island? In an airplane akin to a 'flying testube petri dish'?Ship, boat, airplane - however someone travels to the Bahamas probably has equal bearing when it comes to picking up a germ.Edited: 6:09 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Just canceled everything for the trip scheduled two days later. Fortunately, all flights, hotels, and the Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line provided a full refund or rescheduling without penalty.We will go again when the situation clears out."
"#175 -- Ashley, as of now, only those who have travelled to Italy, South Korea, Iran and China within the past 20 days are restricted from entering the Bahamas. To be honest, given the number of cases on the rise in the US and in other places, I would expect there to be restrictions there too, particularly now since President Trump has declared a National Emergency. But our government has not seen fit to do so at this point. Best thing to do, if you are determined to travel, would be to watch official notices as your travel date approaches. As I type this message, no fewer than 3 large jets have flown over on the way to land in Nassau."
All cruise ships have been docked for 30 days
We are supposed to come the 27th. This would be a great trip

"My family is here in Nassau from the US Midwest, arrived today. Our flight was relatively deserted from O’Hare (maybe half full) with equal five minute waits in the normal and pre-check lines at security at seven this morning - unheard of! It made it much easier than I thought it would to attempt social distancing while in an airport.We are staying in a condo, not a big resort, but I feel safer from infection here than I do at home to be honest. If I were staying at a big resort I may not have that opinion. Or maybe I would, because I am more apt to take necessary precautions went away from home then well in my neighborhood store around my friends and family. I’ve never been one to worry too much about germs but this trip I brought sanitizing wipes and wiped down every surface that we were to touch, made my own bootleg hand sanitizer because I couldn’t find any and used it liberally, and to the point of my teenagers being annoyed with me more than typical reminded them to wash their hands and not touch their faces. Hoping for the best and happy to escape the land of toilet paper hoarding. We told our waiter tonight about that situation and he was laughing so hard and asked why would you hoard toilet paper? We said we have no idea! I’ll end with a public service announcement. My niece has an infant and is paying astronomical prices to have baby wipes shipped to her because people who can’t find sanitizing wipes are buying them in their place. They don’t serve the same purpose. Please stop buying all the baby wipes!"
"Don't come at all, please we rlly dnt want the corona virus"
Thanks for your post. We are debating if we should cancel or still go. What a dilemma. We are also leaving out of ORD. Our concern is not being out there. We are more concerned the possibility of not being able to return since changes are happening each day.
"Anyone book a trip to Atlantis through costco travel? Wondering if they will give back your money or allow you to reschedule.Edited: 8:19 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Since you’re in a condo, did you go to a grocery store? Traveling through Nassau on our way to a private home in the Exumas on Monday, wondering if the shelves are stocked in the stores. Thanks!"
"We were scheduled to arrive to Atlantis in 3/28. We cancelled last night. We were still able to get a full refund. With so many things changing by the day, we elected to take the refund rather than wait it out. Our travel agent was on hold with Atlantis for 2 hours...but very thankful they could accommodate our change. Looking forward to getting there another time."
"Thank you KTC. I'm thinking of booking a trip to Nassau for 3/29 to replace my scheduled trip to New Orleans. I too would be coming from Chicago (Midway). After all the coronovirus saturation on the news, I want to go someplace to escape. Your post is encouraging. Enjoy your vacation! Yah Mon! ......Morrow"
College kids going to Bimini ? have there been any issues there ? Looking for some information don't want them to get stuck!!!!
"We were due to travel to Nassau on 3/30 for 2 weeks. We are from NY where there are many cases and even though we are not sick, we feel it would be irresponsible to make the trip and are cancelling."
"Yes, just got back from the Super Value grocery store. Shelves seemed stocked, including plenty of tp. Had no issues finding the items on our list."
"We live on Harbour Island. No cases yet, but the spring break may change that. No panic buying here and restaurants are full We also have tons of toilet paper!"
I just cancelled today. I had to wait 8 hours for a call back from Atlantis. They wouldn’t give a full refund to my credit card. They put half credit to use within 18 months and the rest is going to be refunded to my credit card. I decided not to travel tomorrow because my husband has a surgery schedule in two weeks and I don’t want to risk being trapped in another country.
Just cancelled. We were suppose to arrive tomorrow for a week. Cancellation fee is waived and applied to a future stay within 18 months; for us it was 27% of total stay. Remaining 73% was refunded to our credit card. We are from RI and yesterday the governor imposed a 14 day quarantine for travel outside the continental US. Rather than wait on hold was told could have emailed customercare@atlantisparadise.com with the cancellation request.
We just got here and the cruise ships are leaving for 30 days. Seems like it’s going to be pretty empty and hopefully excursions will still be available.
Is everything still open and staffed? Are you staying at Atlantis for the week?
"Hello,I feel like you, unsure, we are supposed to travel in April. Did you end up going on your trip? Did everything go well?"
"The Bahamas Prime Minister will be addressing the nation tonight (Sunday 15/3) at 8pm. I suspect this will include school and non-essential government offices closures, as well as more stravel restrictions. Many local businesses are closing and allowing employees to work from home as possible."
They closed the water park as of this morning

"I was suppose to fly out to Nassau tomorrow morning from Toront, Canada and we decided to cancel. Too much going on and would rather postpone than not have a relaxed vacation. Peace out everyone. Stay safe and healthy. Better safe than sorry."
"Flew in from Toronto Friday. Very light crowds yesterday, but noticeably busier today. All pools and water park open despite the earlier report. At least as of noon Sunday. They have stopped selling day passes for cruisers though, although that won’t matter much once the existing sailings finish their trips."
"Hello, we are planning to go to Bimini next weekend. Can we have any updates on the Coronavirus there?"
Thanks for the update and please keep them coming!
"Well, it was a matter of time given the constant coming and goings of flights and cruise ships. We have our first confirmed case in the Bahamas as of Sunday, March 15. It is a 61-year old female resident with no travel history. We know very little at this point, but expect to get more updates this evening when the Prime Minister will be speaking to the nation."
"Do you have a link to this news since there is nothing on local Bahamas news channels.?Edited: 2:24 pm, March 15, 2020 "

for how long?

"Everything is open at Atlantis. I’d guess they are still 60+% capacity but nothing like what a normal spring break would be like. Spent the day out in the sun, beach, pools and slides. Tons of families and people just arriving. From a health perspective, feel much safer here than back in the chaos. Obvious only concern is getting stuck here, but checking updates a few times a day to stay on top of developments"
"Apparently, Atlantis no longer allows people from cruise ships into Atlantis waterpark for the day. That would be a good choice on their behalf!!"

We cancelled our vacation for this month to Bahamas. Crazy what is going on in our world. Stay Healthy everyone.

"Hi, as of now, I do not see flights from US to Nassau being restricted. If anyone has more up to date info, please post. thanks!"
Atlantis is asking their workers to either use their ca==vacation time or take 2 weeks unpaid time off.SO things will not be business as usual.A friend of mine who is a bartender at another large hotel on the island has been told to take a mandatory vacation Others have been told the same.
"yep, agree that things have changed now with hotels... cancelling trip now."
"Corroborating Atlantis news, we just cancelled our trip which was planned for 3/20, stay healthy everyone!https://ewnews.com/atlantis-asks-employees-t…"
Is everything still open at the Atlantis resort?
They were arrested not detained for the virus.
I have been on hold with the hotel for 5 1/2 hours on one phone and 2 hours on another. Anyone have any other ideas on how to get thru to cancel?
We are at the Atlantis now. Arrived March 14It is not full by any means plenty of opportunities for social distancing. Weather is beautiful.
"We used e-mail and got an immediate ticket/response - reservations@atlantisparadise.com, include your reservation number(s). We did the same for restaurant reservations."
Has Atlantis closed water park?
Is water park closed? What has closed?
Water park is open. Only thing closed is kids club.
"Regina K, you live in Italy and you flew to the Bahamas? Isn't Italy in total lockdown?"
"I’m in the Bahamas right now, flew in on Monday 3/16 from Austin, TX. I bought a day pass to Atlantis for Friday before the single case of COVID-19 was confirmed. Apparently Atlantis is making a decision on Thursday to decide if they will stay open. There is a rumor that the staff will be forced to take paid vacation. When I called the Atlantis, they would not tell me anything as far as if they would close, just that we are still open as of now...I had also booked a boat excursion to Exuma on Wednesday and found out today that it has been cancelled. The grocery stores are fully stocked and there doesn’t appear to be panic people buying (maybe it’s because a bag of chips costs $8!). Atmosphere is pretty laid back and the restaurants were open yesterday. If I had known that we wouldn’t be able to do much I wouldn’t have ended up coming but am going to make the best of it with the possibility that we may have to leave early. TL:DR. There is more chaos in the US than here but if you come you will be limited in what you can do."
Those are the two things we were going to go. We are supposed to come next Friday.
love it
"We just returned from Atlantis on March 16th. Our tower(Coral tower) was being evacuated due to ""low occupancy""-now I read there is 1 confirmed case of Corona at Atlantis. Restaurants are closing certain days. I am not a worrier-but was happy to go home to the US. Its a ghost town there."
"We just returned on the 16th. Coral towers was shutting down, Waterpark was closed. Casino is next."
Was the waterpark closed every day? We are supposed to go on Friday and Atlantis won't tell us anything. I have never gone and the waterpark was one of the main reasons I wanted to go!
Hi! Wow - so I just got done talking with someone from Atlantis staff who said water park will still be open tomorrow 3/18. So definitely mixed messages going on! Did they close it temporarily? We will be rescheduling our trip regardless but just deciding when to reschedule
"<< ""We are supposed to go on Friday..."" >>Meaning... you're still on the fence about going?Assuming your cable TV and internet service is working, I won't jump on the bandwagon about curtailing virus spread, protecting yourself, protecting others, etc. That's apparently not working for a great many people. So be it.Instead, I'll appeal to baser instincts: You should cancel your trip now if you can. Why? Because -- forgetting that your trip will probably be cancelled by the governments of one or more countries -- your trip is going to suck. Really, really suck. Restaurants will be closed. Services will be curtailed. The place will be a ghost town. You won't be able to buy/bring enough wipes to wipe down Atlantis. The waterpark will be closed (hard to sanitize a waterpark) And, ultimately, you're going to spend every waking hour checking the internet for updates and worried the whole time about whether you'll be able to get home, and how, and when.That's not a vacation that I can see anyone being ""on the fence"" over."
The waterpark was closed as of Monday. There was very poor communication to us-no one was saying anything. Casino will close for sure too. Im reading the hotel will decide on Thurs if they are closing entirely.My concern was being allowed back to the US.
"We were told on Monday, that the waterpark was closing on Monday. Definitely reschedule so you can experience the whole Atlantis. June is a great month there. Don't go after daylight savings like we did in November as the sun goes down at 430pm."
Ok thank you for giving us some first hand insight! Hopefully the pandemic will subside before the date that we push it out to.
Thanks for the info. We have a trip planned to Exuma on the 21st - the 28th. It was a hard decision but we’ve decided not to go. We wouldn’t want to be there and be quarantined and then have trouble getting back to the states. I’m surprised they haven’t stopped people from coming into the country.... it’s going to be hard on the travel industry and poor countries who depend on tourism. I’m playing for everyone.
"If anyone finds out if Atlantis announces they are closing, please post it here. I can't get a hold of Costco where I booked the trip. We are cancelling either way, but if Atlantis closes, perhaps our travel insurance will actually give us back our money. Thanks, people. Stay well!"
"#231 - "" rumor that the staff will be forced to take paid vacation.""It's not a rumour. Atlantis staff are being told to take 2 weeks UNPAID leave. This isn't exactly voluntary. The resort occupancy rate is under 50%, which is what's triggered this policy. There is growing pressure on the government to CLOSE flights to/from the US and Canada, as people are concerned that more cases will be brought in and spread CoVid-19 here. Your own countries are telling you to stay home, not make unnecessarily travel, and to limit exposure. Why do you ignore that advice and come here to spread it to us? Yes, we need the tourism dollars and yes, we do enjoy sharing our sun, sand and sea with everyone, but PLEASE, use common sense and don't add to the global spread of this disease. We are not a rich nation, but we would like to be a healthy one! Please be considerate and consider postponing your trip.Edited: 4:49 pm, March 17, 2020 "

I just spoke to someone at Atlantis to make some cancellations and she told me everything is operating as normal.
As a Bahamian advising I would stay away right now.
It is unfair right now for anyone to travel. You are putting our country men at risk and could also be taking away hospital beds that will be much needed.
And hard on the people here watching visitors come in and disregard any thought of social distancing and think because they are on holiday basic guidelines don't apply ...
"#245 RJP-NJ, what's mixed? Clearly reading comprehension must be a challenge. Your rude and snarky comments across several posts don't reflect well on you either. Is that clear enough?!?"
That's not true! They closed our tower Monday. Stay away from travel right now.
"<< ""what's mixed? Clearly reading comprehension must be a challenge."" >>It is, for the masses. Most people hear what they want to hear. And I guarantee that there are people who read your post and thought ""Yeah... we should go"" because that's what they want to hear."
Is the New Year a good time to visit Atlantis? Like Dec 26 through Jan 2?
"You are past hurricaine season, but its cooler and the sun goes down early, around 430pm"
hi!everything was ok at the Bahamas ? I am traveling the May I am thinking about cancelling my trip.
We had a trip planned for April 3rd and just cancelled
Stay home people! Every time I read about people still traveling I think how selfish they are! No concern for anyone / anything other then themselves and their vacation.*end rant*
thank you!
"I just cancelled our family trip to Eleuthera for the week of April 4th. Family very, very disappointed all around. It's the right thing to do health-wise for all. I feel bad for the local communities that we can't support them financially right now when they need us most, but we'll be back strong in the future. Be safe everyone!"
How is it in June?
"i'm planning a trip to Nassau paradise island on the 26 th of april. just wondered if i'll be able to fly there from buffalo ny? should i be concerned, terry"
We have a vacation planned for 27May. We cannot cancel yet. Hoping it will be over by then.
"Hello everyone. I have been tracking the situation using this helpful thread. Family Christmas gift is cancelled as of today. Disappointed for sure. Planned trip 4/13-4/18. I emailedreservations@atlantisparadise.com included my booking number. They emailed me back with full refund receipt back to my CC. I did book directly online back in December. Wishing all on here and in the Bahamas best of health and let's all do the right thing and not travel if you don't need to. It will save lives.-Karl Charlotte, NC"
"For those of you cancelling, thank you! It's a huge disappointment, I know, but it really is the right thing for right now. For those still thinking of travelling, please DON'T. The US has issued a Level 4 travel advisory -- which basically means ""don't travel"", several states in in lockdown, and the Bahamas has just implemented new restrictions. As of today (Friday, March 20), all non-essential businesses are closed (including bars and liquor stores) and there is no public transport, nor many restaurants offering anything but take out service. Also, there is a mandatory curfew from 9pm to 5am. Please come back when we (and the rest of the world) return to normal! If you're travelling up until the end of May, I'd suggest postponing your trip. Who knows beyond that."
A lot of it depends on the airlines. American will not let you cancel a non refundable unless you are traveling by 30Apr.
"ive been here in bahamas for 2 weeks. unsure if i need to rush back home to hell or ride it out..hell meaning NYCEdited: 6:55 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"williamsonomanyc, if you've been here 2 weeks arleady, then you're probably clear of the virus. By travelling back to NYC, you would certainly put yourself at risk. That said, if you have a place to stay, I'd suggest staying put at least through March 31, which is when the current Emergency Orders are effective until. There's no way of knowing what the air travel retrictions may be in the future, so do weigh that as part of your decision. New York state has just gone into a lockdown, so you may face issues getting back immediately. Look at your passport and see what date you've been given to stay in the Bahamas. Do not stay beyond this date, or risk not being able to come back to the Bahamas. If the date is upcoming, you must go to the nearest Bahamas Immigration office (likely the airport) and ask for an extension to stay. This is usually granted."
Did you book a refundable or non-refundable ticket? I booked a non-refundable and was told it would not go back on my cc but a resort credit to be used in the future
"We just canceled our April 18th trip. My kids are so upset. I rebooked for July, just praying it's over by then. My friend who lives in Nassau sent me a tv news link yesterday where they said Atlantis will be closing as soon as the last of the guests leave. It will be closed for at least 4 weeks."
"We have just cancelled our April vacation to your beautiful Island, but will reschedule at a time when our whole world is not in chaos. Thank you Dusty-traveller for your updates and honest opinions! Praying for health and peace to all."
"Baha Mar is closing as of March 25 at 3pm. I'd imagine other hotels and resorts will be doing the same -- many in the out islands have already closed. If that's not a clear enough message for those still thinking of travelling, I don't know what is. Please STAY HOME until this global crisis is over. tribune242.com/news/…"
"I took your advice and extended it until the 31st. New York has over 15,000 cases and declared disaster area. Staying put for now, Anyone else extended their stay? How is the island doing?"
Ours was non refundable but we were told we have 60 days to rebook.
"Poor Bahamas, first Dorian now Covid 19. We pray for you and the world."
Any chance you can post that link? We are supposed to leave on April 12 & only way we can get our $$ back (from booking thru Redweek & having travel insurance) is if Atlantis closes- TY!!
"Shannon M, Atlantis will be officially closed as of 3pm this afternoon (Wednesday, March 25) So you can then call and make your cancellation. We are also under government Emergency Powers Orders -- with a 24 hour lockdown with a few exceptions. These go until March 31, but we are told, it will likely be extended another 30 days. Plus, airports and sea ports are closed to all international arrivals. This will likely continue for some time. No one should be making any travel plans tot he Bahamas before JUNE -- if the run in other countries is anything to go by - 2-3 months is the bare minimum to let this virus run its course.Edited: 9:26 am, March 25, 2020 "
TY so much for the quick reply ‘Dusty-Traveller’ - Stay Safe!!
Will you be tested before going so you don't bring the virus to the people of the Bahamas?
How are you feeling about this now? Don't spread this to other countries.
Didn’t the Bahamas just issue a travel ban?
Why have you been drinking my beer?
"On March 27, the Bahamian government expanded its border closure to include all incoming individuals, not just foreign visitors. No person, whether Bahamian citizen, legal permanent resident, or foreign visitor will be permitted entry into The Bahamas. Bahamian aviation authorities also issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) clarifying that this prohibition extended until May 1 and does not apply to outgoing flights, cargo, commercial courier, and emergency medical evacuation flights. We planned on going on 4/8, but obviously with the travel ban in place through 5/1 not going to happen. Very disappointing!"
Did you go. I’m curious because we have a trip scheduled in 8 weeks
"Hi just curious, did you end going to your cruise or was it cancelled? I have a cruise on the 20th of April and it has not been cancelled yet."
Atlantis is closed
Is it safe to go to the Bahamas in late June 2020?
"No, it won't be safe."
"Canceled our trip, insurance money refunded, Delta no problem, but owner of the condo by Atlantis would not refund our money. Out $6;000. Says a lot about that person."
"Steve, when this is all said and done concerning Covid, one call from your lawyer should get your $$ back. Don't let that owner get away with what he's trying to do to you. Try the CC company that you put your money down with as well.Good luck..."
The airport is closed to incoming passenger planes. How can that owner keep your money if the country is closed???
"@Julie, it's not. You should be able to get your refund when the airline is back to full staffing, whenever that is.I'm sure the flight board you are looking at is just not updated yet. There are no flights in the air. All cancelled and locked down except for essential travel, food, medical supplies, healthcare workers, etc.Trust me, your flight is cancelled. You'll get your $$ back once things settle down. Keep trying and be persistent. Good luck.Edited: 8:54 am, April 08, 2020 "
Can we take our boat to Bimini for the weekend during Easter ? Any restrictions due to virus ?
Stay Home!!

"Does anybody have any insight into what the status of Harbour Island will be in late June? Are hotels there open now? I suppose they're not, but is there any talk of reopening?"
We had a trip planned for late May early June. We took a credit and will go in 2021. It will take time for the Hotels to get back up and running well...
Over on the Cancun boards it says airlines are resuming travel June 1 and they were hit harder than Bahamas. We have Atlantis booked for the end of July/first week of August. Will be interesting to see if everything is open and ready to go by then...
My daughters are supposed to go to Atlantis at the end of June. Do you think the resort will be open by mid to late June?
"Once everything opens up, I think it's way too risky to travel out of the country, but of course, everyone will do what they want. Should wait and see after a few months, then rebook.We are planning Spring 2021 and I think then 'might' be doing better. Only time will tell."

"@pon421July 30th is gonna be iffy at this point. The Bahamas, opening up as a nation to foreigners, has been pushed back to right around that date, July 30th.Just spoke with a couple friends who work at The Reef, where we own, and both told me that only the Royal will be open at Atlantis around July 30th, IF THAT!!The spike in C-19 cases and related illnesses in Florida (and the rest of the USA) is having a direct impact on when the Bahamas will open up again to US citizens.You arriving July 30 is going to be a game time decision on the part of The Bahamian Gov't. I would not bet on it.An email I got from Reef Owner Services last week confirmed the same.If it were me, I would cancel that trip arriving july 30, if for nothing else, safety's sake, but that's just me.Keep in mind that anything that's open in Nassau will be very limited if open at all right around your trip time,Please closely follow what's going on in the Bahamas this month. Good chance you won't even be allowed in at the end of July.This is the email I got from The Reef a couple days ago:July 3rd, 2020 Dear Reef Owners, Last month it was announced that Atlantis would begin a phased reopening as of July 7th. That decision was made knowing that we were well prepared, our team members are extremely professional and further that we would be able to ensure the health, safety and well-being of every owner, guest and team member that walks through our doors. Since making that decision, we have seen the COVID-19 virus shift from a steady decline to a recent surge in many of our key markets. From the start of this pandemic, we have taken the lead in being vigilant and following all of the guidance and direction shared by the Bahamas Ministry of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. It is our responsibility as stakeholders in the community, and to our owners, guests, team members and partners alike, to continue our vigilance. For these reasons and out of an abundance of caution, Atlantis Paradise Island has moved its reopening date to July 30. Further, only rooms in The Royal will be available at that time. The Cove and Reef will not reopen until sometime later in the year. Please see our updated travel policy on our website at AtlantisBahamas.com/travel-updates. Should you have any other questions or concerns please use the feedback form located on the owners' website, Reef Owners Atlantis.com. Make no mistake, these are unprecedented times and none of the decisions we have made over the last few months have been easy ones. However, they have all been guided by our core values of integrity, passion, commitment and courage. We will continue to move forward together, through our vigilance, determination and strength and we look forward to being able to welcome you, our valued owners, back to your home away from home very soon. Sincerely,Reef Owners Services"
Thank you so much for your very informative reply
"It is true, on the government website it states you have to have a negative Covid-19 test from 10 days or less before you're arrival.""As of July 1, 2020, the borders of The Bahamas will be open to all travelers, including visitors, via commercial airlines, private aviation, and vessels. Visitors should contact commercial airlines directly for flight information.Each traveler must submit a Travel Health Visa Application form online at travel.gov.bs. Confirmation will be provided via email. Each traveler must have their confirmation on hand upon arrival at their destination. Travelers must also upload their negative COVID-19 test result (see the following paragraph) at this same website.Each traveler* must also have a COVID-19 RT PCR (molecular swab) test in advance of travel with a negative result. All incoming visitors must upload the COVID-19 RT PCR test results when completing the Travel Health Visa Application prior to arrival. For visitors entering from July 1 through July 6, the test must have been taken no more than ten (10) days prior to the date of arrival. For visitors entering July 7 until further notice, the test results must not have been taken more than seven (7) days prior to arrival.""https:/…"
