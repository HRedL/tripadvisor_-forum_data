"Our bodies were designed to develop natural immunity to various diseases and infections. By more and more people wearing masks, this hinders our body's ability to develop a natural immunity to covid. Honestly, the proliferation of hand sanitizer use over the past several years has hindered many people's ability to develop natural immunity to the various flu strains that have popped up over the years, thus ""requiring"" the need for a flu vaccine each year."
"""By more and more people wearing masks, this hinders our body's ability to develop a natural immunity to covid.""Wow, just wow. Couldn't be more wrong. Will agree wearing masks can hinder. Hinder from people dying. According to your logic why do we even want a vaccine?"
Wow indeed. Not wearing a mask is just showing everyone how selfish you are about their well-being and also how low your IQ is.
"""Our bodies were designed to develop natural immunity to various diseases and infections.

Thank you for the nice comments. :)
I think the previous poster is extrapolating the idea that a child who plays in the dirt builds a stronger immune system than one kept in a sterile environment. Just because letting a child grub around in the dirt helps with immunity does not mean that an adult sucking in covid 19 infested air has the same effect.
"I haven't figured out what's so difficult about wearing a freakin' mask. It helps. If a place requires it and you don't want to wear one, just don't go there. It's so simple that it's painful. I'm in CT and wherever i go, pretty much everyone is wearing a mask. Our numbers are great."
"Rhino just considerate it a ""learning moment"", Not being sarcastic but you may want to reconsider your perspective."
"""Our bodies were designed blah blah blah........"" The mask requirement isn't about your body, it's about people who have contact with you. It helps to protect them, not you. When you want to see your newborn baby and the nurse tells you to put on a mask and a gown first, will you tell her no because of your constitutional right to build up your own immune system?"
"For those who are around my age remember the outrage when wearing seat belts became law and when car insurance became mandatory etc.! was at a tribal casino yesterday and was mandated wearing a mask and actually at least for me it was less intrusive than I had thought.Edited: 12:20 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"Rino, you are a little odd."
"“ I'm in CT and wherever i go, pretty much everyone is wearing a mask.”That’s because your governor, and mine, had the sense to mandate it. Months ago.And now hospitalization rates and fatalities are on a steady decline. And new cases leveling off. And things were slowly able to reopen without any “ surges “.Imagine that. :)"
Waiting to hear what our good friend PnS has to say about this. :)Wearing a mask protects others from you. If you refuse to wear a mask you are selfish and dangerously stubborn.

The real question I have is why are all these stores and places we go just doing all this cleaning now? This should have been in places for a long time not just the odd mop of the isle every few hours. Masks were given out for free here and less than 50% of people are actually wearing them when shopping etc.

"@rhinoman7, I agree with you 100%. People just don’t seem to get it. All these people waiting for the magic vaccine are insane. Look at the flu, we have a flu vaccine that has been developed over many years, but it only protects against certain strains. The strains change every year and even with a vaccine you can get sick. We don’t wear masks during flu season although it kills hundreds of thousands of people every year. Why do people think the mask will save you from Covid? Let your body do what it is meant to and stop freaking out because the media says you should. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, wash your hands and practice good hygiene. It’s really not rocket science people.Edited: 1:33 pm, June 29, 2020 "
""" It’s really not rocket science people.""No it's not but it is health science. ""We don’t wear masks during flu season although it kills hundreds of thousands of people every year""No we don't but just imagine if we did how many lives would be saved. Think you will see this change. In the US the last flu season over 12 months killed 24,000. Covid 19 Over the last 4 months or so has killed well over 100,000. Are you one of the ones still comparing this to the flu? I know science is hard but please just try."

"Why has it changed so much? Don't discount the fact that some of the Republican politicians are also up for election this year. How many moderate Republicans (yes there are some) want to be thought of as just rolling over and being tied to the President's policies? Despite what is happening in their states?For many politician's this can be a career defining period. Remember this isn't March or April, when public safety was the major factor behind most decisions. Today there are many other factors used in setting policies.Anybody want to be in Pence's shoes? When Trump's Presidency is through his career as a Politician will be over. Pence want's to continue his career. I do not envy him."
ktinca:Take it you didn't open up the article. Has nothing to do with politics. Has to do with why the medical community has changed their views on wearing masks and how it could change the rates.

"Face masks dont do anything special when they're worn over and over again and touched several times throughout the day. Doctors and scientists dont wear the same masks over and over again or have to pull them down consistently to eat and drink. The masks are for show to appease those who are scared and are TRULY IGNORANT to what the limits of face masks especially for viruses are. Ironic isnt it?However, if they want to draw this crap out and insist that masks are comparable to a cure to appease the ignorant, I say that keeping Vegas open is worth that. The funny thing is that the mask naysayers are not jerks for not believing fiction, but are just stubborn because it's so easy to just wear a mask so that the country can continue to progress and life can go on for the most part. No matter how much ppl try to manipulate science for their own ego, science will be science, but wearing a mask is not a big deal. Just keep the scared masses and the dictators happy for the rest of the year and hopefully they'll stop their nonsense sometime next year and we can put this behind us.Edited: 2:18 pm, June 29, 2020 "

Sorry all who had this shut down for no reason. Don't like a post just skip over it.
I don’t understand the fight against wearing a mask either! I’m in Connecticut also and am pretty proud how most are wearing their masks and practicing social distancing and our state has great numbers! I wish more states would take this seriously so we can all enjoy our lives again!!

"#2 Attitudes like yours are the reason so many Americans are dying. This is not the flu. There may not be herd immunity from covid-19. Even if there is, it's easy for you to tell people to get sick for the sake of others. Is it worth 50 million people getting sick and a significant percentage of them dying? If you think the economy is slow now, how will it be when everybody is sick? Forget whether casinos are open, who will produce food and other necessities, and manage and maintain utilities? What happens when nobody has enough money for anything because trade has collapsed? Even rich folks won't be able to buy food if everybody is too sick to produce it and stock shelves.This is a horrible debilitating disease, which kills many and leaves many others with ongoing health problems. I think you ought to reconsider your position on herd immunity."

"Yup we have definitely surpassed the number of U.S. flu deaths with this coronavirus. So, since we can't talk sense about the importance of wearing masks maybe it comes down to hospital beds. We will soon be in a position where people who need a bed for other serious medical issues other than coronavirus will not be able to get care. It's all about civil liberties until that person who didn't take precautions, or their family members, cant get care."

^^^^^^ True that! ^^^^^^^^
Masks dont work? How about we draw a new picture for the ones that dont understand. What if I walked up to you wearing pants of most any material and tried to pee on your leg? Chance are good you're not getting wet. Now ima walk up to you and try to pee on your leg while not wearing anything.... Would you rather I wore pants or no pants?
Another comparison of the mouth and the nether-regions!!!

"SHEEP, SHEEP, SHEEP, SHEEP, calm down. If the mask was the holy grail of sickness and the spread of sickness, we would be wearing them all the time, not just during a ""pandemic"".....................and would/should have been wearing them lonnnnnng ago.#70 Exactly, that was a terrible analogy."
...ignorant.
"Why the inverted commas for the word pandemic?Mask arguments aside, there really can be no argument that this is a pandemic. Do you not think so?"
"#72Not ignorant, facts. #73Highlighting the point (those are quotations) that until a pandemic was declared, no one thought about wearing masks. Why aren't they on every year during flu season(s)? And why not on to prevent the spread of other viruses?"
"We also have vaccines for chicken pox, measles and polio that does work so what’s your point?"
"Trying to convince the anti-maskers is like trying to convince people who believe in witchdoctors that maybe using the polio vaccine might be more effective. Factual arguments are irrelevant, as they've been told by Trump to believe what I say, not what they see with their own eyes. The only way to get the anti-maskers to use them, and protect others, is to have Trump buy a mask factory. Once he can make a buck out of it, he'll color the masks red, put MAGA on it, and all the anti-maskers will insist on wearing them, regardless of what they say now.If this seems like too political a response, its because the anti-mask advocates are a political response to the disease created when Trump thought that if he minimized the pandemic, it wouldn't effect him politically. It had nothing to do with science or American traditions or any of the other excuses raised by the anti-maskers. And what does this have to do with Vegas? If the US had responded like most of the other first world countries, we would be on the downside of the pandemic and could actually see a time when we could go back to Vegas and have some fun."
