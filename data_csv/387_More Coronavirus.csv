"This isn't good news. It was somewhat alarming when we heard of the woman being treated in Solano County (between SF & Sacramento). Today, a new case has shown up in Santa Clara (south of SF) https:/…While both of these incidences seem far enough away - anyone who lives here knows that the entire Bay Area is fairly well interconnected with folks living in one city and working in another - so there is a lot of people churn during the day. I kind of thought we'd have more time before stuff like this started to happen - and I wasn't expecting it to start in our own backyard."
"I figured if it started anywhere is would be in our backyard. Bay Area residents travel a ton, we move around the entire Bay Area all the time, and we had a bunch of people quarantined at Travis AFB."
"It’s not good news that’s for sure. We’re an area of huge commutes too. 60,000 people on my side of Santa Cruz mountains alone commute to the Santa Clara everyday. I’m not an alarmist but since we don’t know what the future holds hopefully Bay Area companies will encourage remote work for awhile. Of course it’s the people in lower paying jobs that won’t have a choice as they are probably service industry jobs."
"Given the amount of travel between the Bay Area and China this is not at all surprising. But let’s get a little perspective. We have 2 people testing positive who haven’t been out of the country. The virus, for many if not most, isn’t worse than a common cold. Which is one reason it will spread further than SARS. Many people may never show symptoms but are still contagious. However the fatality rate is low and there is a vaccine almost ready for human trials. It’s not quite the Black Death folks."
"It’s not quite the Black Death folks.And esp for those of us who live in the Bay Area, it's not remotely as bad as AIDS."

"As an ""elderly"" myself, I can tell you almost all diseases is not trivial for us."
"Over 120 children have died from the virusMore than 4000 adults have died from the virusMore than 87,000 people with the virus have been hospitalized.The virus is influenza."
"As someone who lived in Guangzhou ....maybe Canton to some....with direct experience with the environment of SARS and H1N1 and responsible for a slew of expatriates and their families.....I do want to point this out. The Chinese government was....and is....opaque and heavy handed. We got our info from the Center for Disease Control and the Hong Kong health authorities, who ultimately relied on CDC. Even the World Health Organization relied on CDC.The problem this instance is the conscious weakening of the CDC and other science based institutions by you know who.The instructions for dealing with Covid19 are very similar for SARS and H1N1....get a flu shot, the strong one if a senior not because it deals directly with Coronavirus but because it energizes some antibodies against viral diseases. Wash your hand, cough and sneeze responsibly, take care of yourself."
It’s perhaps encouraging that San Franciscans are worrying about a threat more proximate than climate change.
"There is no ""flu shot"" for Coronavirus, so in that respect it is not like the flu.There is also no shot for the common cold."
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/unit…We only have a handful of reported cases because we haven't figured out how to do more testing.
"On the bright side, there is a Time article today about vaccine trials happening already, based on new genetic sequencing technology. And to the climate change denier - polar bears in the arctic are cannibalizing themselves for lack of food."
"I'd expect if you only test a few hundred people out of hundreds of thousands of people in the US that get cold or flu symptoms every winter then you're not going to catch all the cases. You'll only see the tiny tip of the iceberg since a number of milder cases are going to go undiagnosed, untested and people may not see a doctor (and doctors probably couldn't handle the load of everyone with a cold or flu seeing them). I honestly think probably some cases have already slipped through the cracks in most large metro areas with frequent connections to the outside world and as testing gets better and more routine we'll see ""community"" cases in many areas of the US. That is my suspicion, anyway. I'm hoping sick people will stay home, but from riding public transit and being in public places, it is clear that some don't stay home and the bay area isn't unique in that way. Some sick people go out in public and go to work everywhere I've lived any maybe they feel they have to because of work culture & policies, financial constraints or whatever other reasons. At a minimum, I think it's smart to wash and sanitize your hands frequently and move away from anyone who appears obviously sick when you can. It may also help you avoid colds and flu, if nothing else."
"I have no interest in defending our president. Crises like these demonstrate why we need leaders whom we can trust. At the same time, it's important that his critics not spread disinformation that needlessly and dangerously undermines public confidence in our institutions. The AP has investigated the charge that the CDC budget has been cut under Trump and it is not true:https:/…d36d6c4de29f4d04beda3db00cb46104Trump's intent, of course, is a different matter; but that discussion is better left to political forums."
"I’m glad you’re posting this on TripAdvisor. I live in Houston, Texas and it’s just a matter of time before we hear “someone has tested positive” for coronavirus. I cancelled my trip to Mexico City after they confirmed 1 person w/ the virus. Like other countries, Mexico and the US have allowed people to come in without a mandatory quarantine. If a city of 11 million people went on lock down, why aren’t we more strict? When it was Ebola it was an immediate hell no you’re not allowed to enter the US! It’s not the mortality rate but how highly contagious it is and spreads. China built a hospital in 2 weeks and converted public places like a stadium into quarantine station. Now they are dragging people out of their homes who have a fever to stop the spread. STOP listening to government officials and watch YouTube video for yourselves! I work for the local government and won’t believe what they say. By the time government warms you, it’s too late."
"Apparently, the Grand Princess which sailed from San Francisco is being investigated as the common denominator is a cluster case. They are asking anyone who sailed on their mid-February and later cruises to self-quarantine. https:/…grand-princess-updates.html"
Apparently MSC boat in Greece now recalled all passengers because they found a former passenger was sick in Italy. This is totally getting out of control.
LOLSELF quarantine.
That comment is so Orange County.
Test kits are being airlifted to the Grand Princess. The ship is being held out of SF until the tests are completed. The first California death (in Placer County) was a passenger on the previous cruise of the ship.
"I have to add - I've been super diligent about hand washing. I've been sanitizing things like my mouse at work, my TV remote at home. I've been wearing gloves on the subway.I still caught a cold."
Corona virus symptoms are often likened to those of the common cold. Maybe you got it! :)
"Santa Clara county healthcare worker here. We are apparently the hotbed of activity in the state. We are not freaking out but are definitely in ramped up rapid response mode. Being extra careful with screening and protective equipment. Wash your hands and don't touch your eyes, nose, mouth with washing your hand.I got an email from our local children's museum that one of their work might be exposed to COVID. We were just there over the weekend but I am not too concerned at the moment. I am pretty certain the virus is more prevalent in the community than we realize. It will probably stick around like influenza H1N1. Remember that panic? It is now one of the many strains of flu we see each season. Remain calm and wash your hands. Stay healthy everyone."
"Just saw that my alma mater, Lowell High School, was closed today because a parent of a student was found to be infected. Closed Thursday and Friday. Assessment on what to do Monday to be made then.As San Franciscans might know, Lowell draws students from all over the City.Edited: 8:19 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"^^^I taught a law course there back in '83. Very diverse student body.Here in L.A., a health worker at LAX tested positive. We don't know if they contracted it via work or via community. I'm on duty at that same terminal (Tom Bradley International) on Saturday. We're all understandably concerned."
BTW Lowell has 2700 students and a few hundred staff. Student himself not shown to be infected.Abundance of caution....likely to hear that terminology a lot.

SF announces text message service on covid19. https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/…
"I signed up for the text message system as soon as it opened - but have only received a ""welcome"" message. They didn't even say anything about the high school."
"San Francisco Zoo has issued a public message saying it is conscious of concerns and is undertaking to enhanced maintenance. The message also indicated that enclosed areas remain open, but will revisit that if developments so dictate."
We were at the California Academy of Sciences yesterday....Thursday....and there were no notices out. Some school groups were present.IOW normalcy at least at that venue.Going to Exploratorium on Sunday. Public TV member day. Will report.
ALERTSF: To reduce the spread of coronavirus SF health officials advise cancelling non-essential community events for next 2 weeks. www.sfdph.org Uh....maybe we should cancel our vacation
"Depends on your age and health risks. Also avoiding crowds, which can be difficult when a tourist.There should be more clarity by the end of the month. When can you take the trip?"
"I wouldn't cancel unless you have health issues or there is a big cluster where you are heading. I think you are coming this weekend? Just use good hand hygiene and tell the teens not to touch their faces. I am not going to be a hermit. We are going to the city this weekend to visit family as we usually do and will eat out and go to parks.Edited: 10:45 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"We are planning Sunday night through Thursday. I bought change waivers for the airfare and the hotel is refundable. But our vacation time isnt, if we don't go, we still have to use the vacation time. We are healthy, I'm controlled diabetic, but we have elderly parents we will have to avoid coming back."
"You have to decide for yourself. Just because someone else intends to go ahead with activities is irrelevant to you. Objectively the risk is low now. But it is not zero, especially for elderly parents."
"We have tickets to fly to San Francisco on March 13, staying through the 19th, to visit grown children. Staying in a highly rated air b n b. We are in that gray area of elderly, 65 and 68 years of age. Healthy adults Should we reconsider our trip to San Francisco?"
"Again, individual choices. In response to SF Public Health Department some performance venues have canceled or offering exchanges. Stanford University has canceled classes. Not to be taken lightly."
"Addendum to LightPacker.....best to ask your own medical professional and not strangers on a forum on a should or should not matter involving personal health. Since your grown children are in the area, they are far better equipped."
The SF Department of Public Health site:https://www.sfdph.org/dph/default.aspIncludes the tweet from Mayor Breed.
The most relevant piece of advice to consider from that message from the mayor is that people over 60 avoid larger groups (more than 50). How does that advice fit in with your plans?
"""It’s not quite the Black Death folks.""That's because the medicine at that time doesn't compare to now."
You completely missed my point but I give you credit for reading the entire thread.
"Mini-report for Sunday March 8 outing. We went to the Exploratorium, which had a free day for public tv members. Advisory signs out reflecting the SFDPH notice. Fairly sparse. Weather cool, overcast.We were also at the Ferry Building which also wasn’t all that busy, but there was an alarm which emptied the place. Don’t know the reason. While we were there, most decidedly some care in dealing with sampling in evidence. Some of the vendors in the plaza across from the Ferry Building were discussing among themselves prospects for customers....Street car and buses had seats, lots of them. My late afternoon meetup was canceled due to the host not feeling well and not wanting to take chances. I had already gone to the venue in the Westfield.....which also did not seem so busy for a Sunday."
Lowell High School will not re-open Monday. Riordan is shut. Immaculate Conception....which I do not know....closed for two weeks.Riordan also draws from near and far.
Chestnut street was as bustling as ever yesterday. Which means barely being able to walk along the sidewalk for all the people.
There might be a distinction between activities within buildings or building complexes which tend to crowd people together as opposed to folks strolling and going in and out of stores in neighborhoods. And a potential casualty of social distancing is the local store or eatery dependent on foot traffic. Let’s hope not because it already is a socio-economic challenge for some stand alone stores and eateries.
Clement Street is the usual Sunday busy. Just more people wearing masks.
"Liars, I guess you’ve never been on Chestnut on a weekend. Cafes and wine bars are packed with people. Outside dining is crammed. Sidewalks are jammed. Apple Store very busy. Marina Super very busy. More crowding than the Academy. No one wearing masks."
"I’m not in SF but a lot of California visitors come down to the Monterey Bay. We just had our first confirmed case in Santa Cruz. She was on the previous Grand Princess Cruise before the one that is currently quarantined. It took a week before she felt sick after leaving the ship which is probably not a good thing if she was out spreading it around. As far as this having any impact on our local economy I certainly didn’t see it last night in Capitola Village. We had a birthday party to go to in a house on the river and I thought there would be open parking everywhere because people would be staying home. Nope it looked like a regular Saturday night. Restaurants all full as was the parking. I think the impact on the economy will hurt us in the long term. but not yet. Not to sound like a certain someone in DC but Californians that might otherwise be taking vacations to Hawaii or Europe this spring break or summer might choose to do road trips within the state instead. It’s not like there isn’t plenty do right here. There isn’t anywhere I wouldn’t visit because of Corona, but being on a long flight and crowed airports might give me pause."
"My company jumped on the band-wagon and all employees are encouraged to work remotely for the next two weeks. I'm actually relieved. Can't remember if I posted it here, but even with wearing gloves on the subway and washing hands and sanitizing surfaces, I still managed to catch a cold last week. It's too bad most people can't take a two-week sequestering time out. Seems like that would cover the incubation period and help stem the spread."
The activity on this SF Forum has dropped to a trickle.Almost all of my meetings and appointments this week have been canceled on me and we proactively exchanged out our tickets for Hamilton that we had for the matinee this Wednesday. We exchanged out for late April (hoping that things are clearer by then). The run is currently scheduled to end at the end of May.
"I am in healthcare so no working remotely for the most part as we still need to see patients. But we are screening people on the phone to make sure they really need to come in. And trying to separate the sick from the healthy. This is from an infectious disease specialist...https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-…Our N95 masks are locked up because they have been ""disappearing,"" presumably taken by people for person use or gains.Edited: 2:40 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"As someone with direct experience in “flu central” in Guangdong including in a SARS and H1N1 environment, viruses are often seasonal and most are endemic. What doesn’t kill us does often make us stronger....until a new one comes along. Pretty adaptable these pesky viruses.See: https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-…"
"Money and economic policy is something within my wheelhouse, even though I am now retired. We might recall that the SARS crisis in the early 2000s led to many analysts saying that the China boom was over. But by 2004, that was not true at all.I think the nation has a complacency and competency crisis going on. This has led to sharply ideological conflicts which weaponize science and scientists. I have lots of experience in incredibly successful Asian economies. None of them....and some are totalitarian and some intensely democrtatic....have mistreated science and competency as much as we do.Even so, we do in fact have robust and resilient inherent capabilities that can be unleashed and a high degree of decentralization that will probably bring good practices to bear.I dont like draconian methods that the Chinese are prone to employ, but they do also deploy competence. So do Koreans, Japanese, Singaporeans in less draconian ways. We have folks equally capable of doing this."
Yes the St. Patrick's Day parade at Dublin has been canceled. (This Dublin and the other more famous Dublin). But I think Guinness will still be flowing somewhere.
"Chinita sez; “Our N95 masks are locked up because they have been ""disappearing,"" presumably taken by people for person use or gains”Isn’t this crazy? When people are desperate, whether justifiably or not, they do bizarre things. I saw a news video of three dames in Australia battling over one package of TP. One of them had a shopping cart with packages already stacked above head level, so it appeared someone was being a hog and the others called her out for it. There are reports of people stealing bottles of hand cleaner from patients’ bedsides, so hospital personnel have to hide those. And schools reported students refilling their own bottles from the fixed communal cleaning stations.If anyone is a fan of “Twilight Zone,” a popular TV series from my childhood, you may recall episodes of people panicking during the Cold War, with survivalists going to extremes to build and stock elaborate fallout shelters, others who did no preparation and wanted to shelter with those who did, and the resulting pleas, threats, fights, and riots. One memorable episode (not sure I recall all the details) was after a nuclear attack warning (remember the steady siren vs the warbling siren?), and long-time neighbors and friends fought over limited space and resources in a cellar shelter. One family wanted to protect what it had at any cost, the other wanted to get into safety at any cost, and someone was killed. Then the all-clear signal sounded and everyone emerged to discover it had been a false alarm – and they all looked at each other and realized what had happened to their community and themselves as human beings, and what “at any cost” really meant. I hope we never get to that state."
"You are referring to this Twilight Zone episode:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shelter_(The_Twilight_Zone)I prefer this other episode:Edited: 9:27 pm, March 09, 2020 "
This is the other episode.https:/…One_More_Pallbearer
"If you did not open the link I share earlier, here is the text:>>>Abdu SharkawyMarch 6 at 2:45 AM · I'm a doctor and an Infectious Diseases Specialist. I've been at this for more than 20 years seeing sick patients on a daily basis. I have worked in inner city hospitals and in the poorest slums of Africa. HIV-AIDS, Hepatitis,TB, SARS, Measles, Shingles, Whooping cough, Diphtheria...there is little I haven't been exposed to in my profession. And with notable exception of SARS, very little has left me feeling vulnerable, overwhelmed or downright scared.I am not scared of Covid-19. I am concerned about the implications of a novel infectious agent that has spread the world over and continues to find new footholds in different soil. I am rightly concerned for the welfare of those who are elderly, in frail health or disenfranchised who stand to suffer mostly, and disproportionately, at the hands of this new scourge. But I am not scared of Covid-19.What I am scared about is the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic, stockpiling obscene quantities of anything that could fill a bomb shelter adequately in a post-apocalyptic world. I am scared of the N95 masks that are stolen from hospitals and urgent care clinics where they are actually needed for front line healthcare providers and instead are being donned in airports, malls, and coffee lounges, perpetuating even more fear and suspicion of others. I am scared that our hospitals will be overwhelmed with anyone who thinks they "" probably don't have it but may as well get checked out no matter what because you just never know..."" and those with heart failure, emphysema, pneumonia and strokes will pay the price for overfilled ER waiting rooms with only so many doctors and nurses to assess.I am scared that travel restrictions will become so far reaching that weddings will be canceled, graduations missed and family reunions will not materialize. And well, even that big party called the Olympic Games...that could be kyboshed too. Can you evenimagine?I'm scared those same epidemic fears will limit trade, harm partnerships in multiple sectors, business and otherwise and ultimately culminate in a global recession.But mostly, I'm scared about what message we are telling our kids when faced with a threat. Instead of reason, rationality, openmindedness and altruism, we are telling them to panic, be fearful, suspicious, reactionary and self-interested.Covid-19 is nowhere near over. It will be coming to a city, a hospital, a friend, even a family member near you at some point. Expect it. Stop waiting to be surprised further. The fact is the virus itself will not likely do much harm when it arrives. But our own behaviors and ""fight for yourself above all else"" attitude could prove disastrous.I implore you all. Temper fear with reason, panic with patience and uncertainty with education. We have an opportunity to learn a great deal about health hygiene and limiting the spread of innumerable transmissible diseases in our society. Let's meet this challenge together in the best spirit of compassion for others, patience, and above all, an unfailing effort to seek truth, facts and knowledge as opposed to conjecture, speculation and catastrophizing.Facts not fear. Clean hands. Open hearts.Our children will thank us for it.<<<"
"Hmmmfff. That doctor could have written that ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Disasters and crises are when we find out what people are really like, ourselves and others.Chriskuo sez: “The activity on this SF Forum has dropped to a trickle.”Madeline sez (on the statewide forum): “You are lucky we're all bored to tears and trolling the CA forum.”There are six active threads today, and there were five yesterday and four each on Saturday and Friday. This page covers four days. This is nuts. No one is in a mood to travel, or think about travel. I suspect it's partly malaise, along with worry about coronavirus. People are OD’ing on info in ways not possible with the primitive technology of just a few years ago, and they feel beaten up and a little depressed, and they're running low on psychic energy. I haven’t gone anywhere since Friday except to Safeway on Friday night about 10:00 when I knew it wouldn’t be crowded, and to church yesterday for that small group, and I’ve been eating well, doing reading and light exercise. Time to pull out the “Twilight Zone” videos. I live in a complex with lots of landscaped area and near three parks, so I can go out and take walks without having to travel far. Tomorrow I'll probably go to Target as soon as it opens, before too many people bring in their cooties and their hysteria, to get some extra Airborne and a few basics (a few bottles of fruit juice would be nice), and the library for a change of scene. Then there is a church activity in the evening that should have maybe 25 people (unless something comes down from the City prompting us to cancel), and it will be good for everyone to see some living bodies.Today's KCBS traffic reports have been crazy. Traffic is abnormally, almost eerily light for a Monday. People are working from home, or taking time off, some schools in the City are closed, big events aren’t happening, and I suspect many are skipping optional outings like social visits, museums, dining, etc. Even the afternoon commute was light. The traffic reporter said her husband was on a Colma-bound BART train at Balboa station with one passenger; 10 minutes earlier there had been eight. At 7:00 p.m."
"I am San Francisco born and raised, university in Berkeley, then over three decades as an expatriate, then in San Diego and now a newly returned resident ""tourist"" in my home town. As retirees, we have time to wander around and do so, although our physical situation limits some food and beverages. Our Senior Clipper Cards are heavily used. Our CAL connections give us notice of free lectures in fields of interest to us.But many of the museums we visit are pretty sparse, the branch libraries have ended group activities even though few are for 50 people, and CAL has lots of cancelations but many of those have to do with speakers from outside the area canceling....Berkeley unlike Stanford is still meeting.Definitely a strange time.Having sat it out in Guangzhou during SARS and H1N1 with nobody we knew ever sickened but with little to no activities, I will say we are in a far better situation. Quiet without quietude."
"As of late this afternoon, Cal, San Jose State and SF State have canceled in-person classes."
Thanks for the insight. Would you at anyone in this forum be able to tell me if tourist sites are closed?
"Off the top of my head, I don't recall hearing or reading about any of the usual touristy sites like Fisherman's Wharf or Alcatraz being closed. The symphony and ballet have cancelled events for several weeks. I was downtown today and it was dead. I noticed that more restaurants than normal were closed, and very few people were riding the cable cars.Edited: 12:32 am, March 10, 2020 "
M_M_Travels777 - the situation is very fluid. It can change any day. When is your planned visit? Do you have good travel insurance or contingency plans?
"If you guys think the California and SF forums are sparse, you should take a look at the China, Air Travels, and Cruise forums. They are full of posts asking how to cancel and get refunds."
I see that UC Berkeley has moved to online classes. Through break. Labs still operating. Good thing CAL had such a lousy basketball team this year. Not even NIT.But Dubs might face some pressure on this issue of crowds.
"Thank you chinita415, for sharing this rational message."
"Frisco_Roadrunner please report back here if you find any Airborne products at yourTarget. Walgreens near us has no Airborne, has been wiped out of Coldeeze and all Zicam products, antibacterial hand soap in big and small containers. Nowhere has hand sanitizer which was abundant at Target (Colma) just a month ago. Seems like we're living out a Twilight Zone episode"
Soap and water are sufficient for handwashing purposes. Saw plenty of Lysol for surface cleaning purposes at Safeway albeit with on limits.I think earthquake preparedness should have been a good guide on what one should already have in hand even without virus threats.
"Went to Target in Colma. On shelves: TP, maybe 25% typical shelf amount. Either they'll restock the shelves or run out soon. No hand cleaner, of course, and very few liquid hand soap. No isopropyl alcohol, and almost no antiseptic first aid cream like Neosporin. Cold, cough, and immunity aids like Airborne or zinc almost out; I bought a bag of cough drops and 2 bottles of similar thing to Airborne and left 2 for someone else. This was around 8:30-9:00,and there were more shoppers than typical for this early on a weekday. No one was pushing, yelling, etc. - but hey, the day is young. Parking lot looks more like 11:00 or so."
"I am currently suspending my plans to visit San Fran in June because of all this. I am hoping to resume these plans next month. We really were looking forward to flying in to SF, driving down the coast to Big Sur, then going to Yosemite before ending up in Vegas. The only thing that has been booked is Vegas. It’s tempting to look at current prices on flights, etc because prices seem to be getting cheaper. Hope this all dies down soon. California vacation is top on our list this summer!"
"Ah, thanks for the report Frisco_Roadrunner.FYI went online last night and no surprise Coldeeze and Zicam are sold out. Same with hand sanitizers.Edited: 2:25 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Boytribe, see my post in #55 on possible seasonality of Covid19. Lots of viral infections in past have been seasonal. Some have not. Don’t know about this one."
"Several San Francisco schoy s have closed for differing amounts of time.The Archdiocese of San Francisco will close all of its 90 schools in San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin counties for two weeks.https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Bay-Area…Several colleges have gone to on-line classes. This is easier for colleges or high schools because they don't have to worry about families having trouble revamping their child care arrangements. For those with grade school kids, if the parents haven't already been told to stay home from their workplaces, this could be a problem."
Not to mention that kids are getting infected at a MUCH lower rate than any other age cohort.
But can carry asymptomatically. Little landmines.
I see Coachella has bit the dust: https:/…index.html
Sensible advice from UCSF doctor:https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/coron…
I read the Dubs are pushing back hard against closing the Chase Center.
"The doctor in that SFGate article (Reply 82) suggested""Everyone needs to get their flu shots.""In my local area (within an hour of the affected Nursing Home COVID-19 outbreak), I have not been able to find any flu vaccines currently available for otherwise healthy adults. None in stock. (This is for someone else; I got my shot!)I don't know if flu vaccines are readily available in other areas."
"We had trouble getting our high dosage senior citizen flu shots this year with our clinic and CVS in many San Diego locations on back order. We finally got one in a CVS in San Francisco. Costco does not offer the high dosage shot.But do get one if you haven’t even though it is not directed at Covid-19Edited: 1:14 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"With San Francisco now banning all gatherings of 1000 people or more, it will be interesting how the Dubs respond."
They will have to be very selective about who they leapt in.Stanford announced today they will only be allowing a few family members into athletic contests.
"Nurse here too, and our N95 masks are locked up too. We have Vegas (for husband) this month, Disneyland next month (dapper day, damn!) and Hawaii in June. I believe we will cancel all.Wondering if the US will cancel all international flights now that it’s declared a pandemic?"
The official response in the U.S. is that it's under control and it will GO AWAY.
Who should we believe?Experts or climate change deniers?https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coronavi…
Warriors will be playing without fans. Giants have cancelled their 3/24 exhibition game at Oracle.

"I am due to come to San Francisco 21st March, and trying to decide whether to reschedule. I am not overly worried about Covid-19 for my own health - I am not elderly and have no underlying conditions. I have a slight concern about getting quarantined during my stay, but would cope with that if it happened. My main concern, and reason for considering rescheduling is that there may be not many tourist sites open by the time I get there. Obviously outdoor activities such as parks, exploring neighbourhoods, walking, cycling, the GG Bridge, the Presdio should be fine to do, but museums, Alcatraz, Coit Tower may I guess close? As may restaurants if they aren't getting enough business to make it worth staying open? I can change my flight dates with no fee (other than any fare difference) and my hotel is cancellable with no charge up to 17th March. I would lose Alcatraz cost and basketball cost (but I wonder if the match may be cancelled and I get refunded?). However, looking at costs for September (the last month I can rebook for, and I want to book as far into the future as possible) although flights are a similar cost, my hotel is around $600 more for my 6 night stay, as I got a great deal on booking.com. I also obviously have no idea if the situation will have improved by then, and I will have moved it for no benefit. I am currently debating with myself what to do.......Sorry just realised this is a bit of an essay!"
"Don't know if it helps you to decide, but my company - along with many others have told works to work from home until Monday 3/23. At that point they will reassess, depending on how things have either improved or gotten worse."
We're in the same boat. We're not afraid of illness but we are afraid of getting quarantined or wasting our time.
"For now museums are open but ""gallery experiences"" only ... no lectures or tours. Needless to say the outdoors is always open and we have a lot of that even in the city limits. Warriors have just announced they're playing without audience so if that includes your date you should get a refund. Perhaps touristy neighborhoods are quiet but mine, at least this past weekend, was jumping as always. If you are not worried about the airplane flight (which is probably the worst part of the trip, germ-wise), I'd wait as long as possible ... your hotel cancel date and re-evaluate. Your hotel may even extend your cancellation date. An entry quarantine is an entirely different matter and not one that's been publicly raised to date. But given what you've told us about yourself and your risk tolerance, I'd say it's very possible you could have an outstanding time and ride cable cars to your heart's content. And be welcomed in every restaurant in town.Edited: 6:13 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Some perspective.Having been in charge of several score expatriate employees and their family members during a forced self-confinement in Guangzhou during SARS in which we had no one in the group or anyone we knew ever sickened, let me say there is sort of a stress that comes with protracted inaction even without the urgency of actual harm. We continued to be paid, we had easy enough access to food and essentials, our devices had already been compromised anyway by Chinese surveillance, and virtually everybody had taken care of autopay for credit cards and the like before exposing our devices to Chinese hacking.We in California are nowhere near so self-confined. But still there is stress. And while we were a smallish grouping of people who could get along well with one another....it helped that we did not live all together but in several clusters.....SF society including micro-society need to become more mindful....hate that word but actually essential. That means not hoarding....you should have gotten your earthquake stash prepared already....and not causing stress to others who probably are already stressed.We continue to go shopping and eat out locally. Foot traffic way down though. Been really nice out."

"Thank you everyone! I have spoken to the airline (Virgin Atlantic) and as well as moving my flights, I also have the option to cancel my flights and retain an open ticket/credit with Virgin, to be used within a year from when I make the original booking. So I have options.I do plan to leave my decision until as late as possible, and have just contacted the hotel to see if they will extend the cancellation period to the day before I go. I will be keeping an eye on what is open/closed, as well as travel advice from both UK and US governments, and advice from SF authorities.It did occur to me that I may get to have cable cars all day long if I want, and I would certainly plan to be spending my money in many restaurants!"
"""It did occur to me that I may get to have cable cars all day long if I want""Definitely buy the Muni passport, which gives you unlimited HOHO on all Muni cable cars, historic streetcars, metro trains, and buses any time for the duration of the passport. Not only is it a money-saver, but you need not worry about having exact change, which is required for cash fares (so if your actual fare is $3.00 but you have only a $5.00 note, the City makes a profit on you).This is for Muni (San Francisco Municipal Transit) only, not BART, the Bay ferries, or other transit systems around the Bay Area. But Muni is what you're most likely to take, with possibly a BART ride from or to the airport."

"Every country in East Asia practices entry and exit controls, and it has been a practice for some for arriving visitors to list their airline seat. This facilitates surveillance of people possibly infected with some disease or other. Not perfect, but a headstart. During and after SARS and H1N1, every arrival area....including train stations....had temperature monitoring equipment. This was set up as a pass through, and only if one set it off, was one pulled aside.Outside of travel, many sites with lots of visitors also monitored temperatures.I doubt we have the equipment in sufficient quantity to deploy to many places."

What can you recover? Travel companies have relaxed their reimbursement policies. You may still be able to come but there is no guarantee what you will be able to do and you run the risk of being quarantined.
"We are in the same boat - we have a 2 week California holiday of a lifetime/road trip planned in mid-May. We are from the UK so we are currently allowed to fly to the US but that may well change in the coming days, weeks, months. Flying with British Airways - hoping they will refund our flights/car hire if we end up cancelling the trip due to the outbreak. All our hotels other than Yosemite Valley are pay on arrival with free cancellation so not much of a worry there. We haven't taken out any travel insurance yet, so going to do this tonight which will hopefully cover flights if British Airways won't refund them. Nightmare. Going to play it by ear and just hope it improves by May.Edited: 7:40 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Luke, go ahead and look into travel insurance. It may be different in the UK but in the US you have to “ cancel for any reason “ and it needs to purchased usually within 21 days of first deposit. In your case probably Yosemite. Also check your credit card, sometimes they have really good built in insurance. Most US airlines are allowing refunds and or free rebooking. The cut off right now seems to be for flights by early May but I expect that to change. Good luck.Edited: 7:55 am, March 12, 2020 "
generally speaking showing up to any region experiencing its own crisis is selfish. what if you fall ill? what if you catch something here and fly with it and infect others in your home country? we're all making sacrifices for the greater good. think about being part of the solution of not spreading this by staying home and reevaluate in a month.
"For a lot of foreign visitors, the choice of visiting is being taken from you....a good thing imho. We can easily turn into a major hot spot.Even those foreign and domestic visitors who can come...for now....a cause for pause."
"Luke, assuming you made your Yosemite Lodge reservations on the official website, you cancel and get full refund of your deposit up to 7 days before the date of arrival.https:/…I doubt you can get any insurance to cover your trip at this point, but if things continue as they are, BA should be offering some kind of free cancellation or change option closer to the date."
I work with dance companies and we are cancelling tours. It is the responsible thing to do to self isolate and not travel. For foreign visitors be aware that in the best of times US health care is overly expensive and not good. If you fall ill in the US you are in danger of going broke and not making it home. Not worth the risk.
"The San Francisco Unified School District is closing all public schools for three weeks, beginning this coming Monday. It joins the Archdiocese which has closed its 90 schools in San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin counties.And no Disneyland, NBA, March Madness, or MLB to give everyone a break. This might be the time for families to relearn the art of in-person conversation, pull out the dusty Scrabble sets, pump up the tires on everyone's bicycles, and rediscover fun."

"I went to the Marina Safeway yesterday. Appalling! I got a parking space but walked in one door and out the other. Lines for checkout went the length of the building. Way worse than when Marin had no power and had to shop here. Truly revolting. No one needs to stock up on TP. If you find yourself self-quarantined, that's when Amazon comes in handy."
"People who can afford to buy 20 bottles of Nyquil, or have a car to haul 20 multi-packs of TP home, should not be allowed to deprive everyone else. For the last couple weeks, I've wondered why all retailers weren't putting limits on purchases of essentials like TP, cold and flu medication, cleaning supplies, etc.In all fairness to all customers, and to prevent mob scenes, stores should have started doing this some time ago now. With a notice posted in front of the store: MAXIMUM 48 total TP rolls; 24 quarts of bottled water, 2 Lysol, or whatever, the rules would be clear and people would go into the store knowing what they could buy (depending on supply, of course).Everyone knows that San Francisco has a huge car burglary problem, and we don't leave valuables in cars or anything in view that might attract one of our opportunistic parasites. So what did I take out of the car and bring into the house a few days ago? A bottle of hand sanitizer. I don't have an unlimited supply, and didn't want any of it to get stolen, or be the cause of someone doing hundreds of dollars of damage. What a world we find ourselves in."

Is it possible that all those folks actually went to Tahoe or Reno in all the rain and snow of this weekend to try for a last fling on the ski slopes, in spite of warnings to avoid travel or groups because of the virus? And if they aren't taking 101 or 280, they must be dispersing into San Francisco or southern Marin.I wonder how many got all the way up there and discovered that Heavenly, Squaw Valley, Sugar Bowl, Kirkwood, Alpine Meadows, Mammoth Mountain, and other ski resorts were shuttered as a COVID precaution."

"The Grand Princess is sailing by my living room window. That's the ship that gained worldwide notoriety while it sat outside the Golden Gate with 3500 people aboard for days while quarantined for coronavirus.This is the first time I've seen a major cruise ship from where I live, because the San Francisco cruise terminal is out of my view. It just left the port of Oakland after sending off all the passengers and all but a skeleton crew to operate the ship until the company figures out what to do about it. Those crew members will also be in quarantine.It is headed south in San Francisco Bay and reportedly will anchor in the Bay for the time being. I'm thinking maybe one of the container piers at India Basin. It doesn't have an escort anymore; the tugboat or harbor pilot that accompanied it along South Beach and China Basin peeled off awhile ago. A somewhat ignominious end for a vessel more accustomed to the tourist-rich cruise port in the midst of Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, and the Alcatraz ferry dock.Edited: 3:10 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"The Grand Princess, the subject of so many reports about quarantined passengers and crew stranded outside the Golden Gate, is now in San Francisco Bay. It left the port of Oakland this morning and from my living room window I watched it sail south, escorted part of the way by a tugboat. It’s now sitting offshore, off what looks to be Pier 96, at anchor but not docked.A skeleton crew is still on board after most of the 3500 passengers and crew were taken off, to be sent to quarantine elsewhere. The remaining crew will be in quarantine on the vessel, unable to leave but at least able to enjoy some beautiful views from the ship."

Wow has it been a month already since SFI posted this? I think the curve is flattening a little in CA compared to NY. Don't look at the total cases because testing is variable. Look at the death rates.We are getting ready for the surge in the next 2 weeks down here in Santa Clara County. The convention hall is being set up for a low acuity respite site. Our hospitals are ramping up capacity. I keep saying we are nervously waiting for the tidal/tsunami wave to hit. We are getting battle ready.

"Good morning, fellow shelter residents. I went to church this morning where we did it by Zoom this week. This was a change from what we’ve been doing on the internet. One advantage of Zoom is that people who don’t have the internet, or don’t know how to make full use of all that it offers, can still listen in. We do have folks who have internet but I'm sure use it only for e-mail, who literally cannot download an app and are challenged when you invite them to “do a Google search.”Here is something you can do that you may not have thought of before, but it’s a real practical thing now. Keep track of your TP use. You don’t need to keep a notebook by the toilet/loo/john/ can/potty/pot/w.c./ dunnie/donniker/great white throne to record every incident. Before you put a new roll on the rack, write the date and time inside the cardboard core. If it’s hard to reach in with a regular pen, it may be easier with a Sharpie. Do this for a couple of rolls and you’ll get an idea how long a roll lasts. Another reminder: in U.S. sewer or septic systems at least, only TP should be flushed. People who run out have been using paper towels, newspaper, cut-up old clothing, and other “creative” means, which has caused big blockages in some places. I learned a new word from reading the news: “fatberg.” That’s a build-up of soap and other bath product residue, fats and oils from kitchens, food residue, cigarette butts, fabric, hair or pet fur clippings, TP substitutes that don’t break down in water, and other things that sewage systems aren’t meant to handle. Public works employees in London found a 130-ton fatberg; the last link below (may be TMI for some folks) is about that phenomenon.Sewage system managers want everyone to know that toilets are not trash cans, and only the 3P’s: pee, poop, and (proper toilet) paper should go down. Paper towels, Kleenex, table napkins, newspaper, and other paper can be too dense to break down in water. So-called flushable baby or hand wipes are not light, degradable paper, but a heavier woven fiber that is also slow to break down. One wipe may go down your toilet, but it joins with the whole neighborhood’s discards in the branch and main lines and can eventually lead to YKW backing up into homes. If people must use a TP substitute, they should put it in their regular garbage; maybe in a separate closed plastic bag for hygiene and odor control until the garbage is taken out.https://abc7ny.com/6041974/https:/…https:/…"

I look up Arkansas Coronavirus and get warnings about people from other states entering. That's not your worry. It's already there and it's coming. I worry more about Arkansans coming to CA when they think the ""all clear"" has sounded.I hope your son in being diligent about the orders. It's young people who aren't as much so and I'd hate to see more germs returning to Arkansas than are already there."
"Anyone wanna see another weird sight? You won't have the opportunity to see this again, so get an eyeful now.https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/N…"
"Per the SF Chronicle (think it's still The Chronicle), Distancing is working! California's COVID-19 peak is expected in May. My fingers are crossed(!). https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/c…"
"SF is doing exceeding well. A city of about 900K. With about 600 cases and only nine deaths. NINE deaths. Think about that. NYC is about 10x the size. They’d be thrilled to have 6000 cases and 90 deaths. It’s not apples to apples but SF, fingers crossed, has proven that early Shelter and social distancing has worked. But it is way to early to celebrate. There is a long wY to go before a vaccine and that will be the only way to rid this scourge."
"Our plagues have come....we had a quake in the south, there has been stormy weather, boils on our hands from too much sanitizer, etc. I wanted to smear lamb’s blood on my door, but Costco had sold it all out."

"Experts have said that initial Covid-19 in NYC is not from China, but from UK. How about SF. Do RNA Assay test means there are unrecognized cluster. If tracing is work well, so RNA Assay test is not necessary."
"Sarwa, what experts have sayed these? Can you provide a link, so we all can read it?I never heard this."
The NY Times has reported that the virus in New York came from EUROPE (not UK specifically). Which makes sense when you consider that 1) travel to the US from China was shut down much earlier than Europe and 2) one would think that the infection rate on the west coast would be much worse than NY if it were all coming from China.
"OK, for sure the virus came from Europe. It is going round the world, starting in China, going west. So first it came to Europe and than it went further west and reached USA. In a ""round"" world this is the normal way.So we had the peak of infections a few days, maybe 2 weeks, earlier than you and hopefully we'll reach the decrease also earlier. For a few days now it seams so.Let's all hope that these bad times will go by quickly."
"Top U.S. destinations for Chinese visitors are NYC, LA, SF, Vegas, DC, and Boston. Numbers tapering off due to trade war, including slower visa issuance and renewal by U.S. Italy hugely popular in Europe.Of course, most Chinese tourism in neighboring Asian countries."
"It is link for you,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…The virus appears to have been imported to New York from the U.K. and several European countries, including France, Austria and the NetherlandsMeans USA is not tracing well, tracing close contact is important and relatively cheap. In Indonesia patient number 1 and 2 is cluster from Japanese visit Indonesia, but has hospitalized in Malaysia, patient number 3 is sub cluster of cluster number 1 and 2. Tracing is important maybe there are persons in incubation period and asymptomatic persons. If there are new positive Covid-19 patient and who analyze the swab test in clinical laboratory cannot determine from which cluster, so RNA test is done. RNA test is expensive. All these procedures and tests must be done since the beginning of Covid-19, so we have accurate map of Covid-19."
All very well and good...maybe....but important for this forum is how to deal with now and into future.
"For now and the future,I'm not monitoring USA since beginning, but maybe USA can follow South Korea and Indonesia, but can be applied or not is a question, because USA has many states.First is make task force, report to president, but relatively independent, consists of health minister, economic persons, police, military, etc.Second, all 100 hospitals which can handle Bird Flu previously must ready, if there are Covid-19. Nowadays maybe there are 200 hospitals.Third, financial, ready by reallocate the budget.Fourth, logistics, it is rather difficult, but finally there are logistics up to August 2020. Fortunately, Indonesia has already prepared for fasting month and Ied Holiday. Relatively no panic buying, except for a week, after patient number 1 and 2 are announced. Masks and hand sanitizers are sold out even in the first day, but all products are still available, no empty racks.Fifth, PSBB or Big Scale Social Limitation is proposed by area and must be approved by Health Minister based on spread out in the area and sufficiency of logistics and other needs of the area.IMHO, if every states do what they want and the president allow Zaandam Cruise Ship to dock in California and there are no task force, maybe some states will more suffer than the others."
"It's not a blame game, as someone from uk, just do what you can. Stay home and stay safe! The sooner we all do this the sooner we can hopefully get get back to normal!"
"The Zaandam docked in FL and it was the governor’s call, not the president’s. Stick with what and where you know. Because it isn’t the US."
From time to time I bring up Korea and its successful approach. Indonesia was notorious reporting zero cases for quite some time....defying credibility.....hence no real shock when the Jokowi government finally coming clean. No positive lessons of use for us from Indonesia imho.https://www.theguardian.com/global-developme…

"As it turned out, 1906 was too important for everyone to let it pass unnoticed. There are still real San Franciscans, and a few slipped out yesterday to mark the anniversary, taking care to be socially distant.https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/… I ""went"" to church this morning on Zoom, which alternates with a live stream depending on what and how many events will be taking place. We had a good turnout, including some whose names I recognized from our member lists but don't know for sure who they are. It might be that some folks feel more comfortable at cyber church if they have been absent or less active and aren't sure they will know anyone or be welcome. We'll need to make note of them and reach out once people are people again. Also had some join us who have gone out into the world, are living elsewhere, SIP at college or, otherwise physically away. A big container ship is floating outside my living room window. According to the maritime traffic website, it's the 1200-foot-long Hapag-Lloyd Kuala Lumpur Express, up from Long Beach and waiting to dock at the port of Oakland. Since ice cream can’t travel by fishy-back containers, the next best thing would be a load of TP. :^) Several other vessels are out in the Bay off Islais Creek. I can look down at people in the small park a couple blocks away, and since it seems to be a pleasant day, I’ll put on my bandit mask in a little while and get outside for a stroll around the neighborhood.See everyone later – hope you’re all well.Edited: 5:30 pm, April 19, 2020 "
