"I have a full family vacation planned in early May and it doesn't look like that is going to happen. I would love to rebook but I have a limited window, with children, their spouses and growing families. I'd like to rebook sooner than later. I know no one has a crystal ball, but what are your thoughts about when travel should resume?"
"<< ""what are your thoughts about when travel should resume?"" >>Too many unknown unknowns to even hazard a guess.1.) To try to guess what’s going to happen with the specific medical impact of the virus and mandated travel restrictions globally, between now and whenever is a fool's errand.2.) Layer on the potential for the disproportionate impact that will likely be experienced by tiny island destinations that don’t have the same infrastructure and other businesses to support a general rebound that countries like the US and major metro-areas like Philly do.3.) Then there’s the potential for specific, disproportionate economic impact on any given airline, resort, property owner, or tourism-serving business.. (ie will the place you book even be back/still in business by then? Will the airline you book even come back to the route in question? Which restaurants, excursions, service-providers, etc will not be back by then... if ever?)4.) Lastly, all of the above will have a ""vicious cycle"" effect on the demand for travel; people will be slow to come back to travel... if the travel market isn't ready for them to come back... which will keep the travel market depressed... etc"
2021 at this point. If we are lucky.

At least 2021.
2021...too many unknowns to even attempt 2020
"We rebooked for late Feb, 2021 into March. Too many unknowns. Hoping it will not be a repeat of this year."
"I don't trust a rushed vaccine. I'd rather wear a mask and wash my hands, plus get the 5 minute test which shows positive or negative. So you have to show up 2 hours and 15 minutes before takeoff instead of 2 hours. We rebooked for December, 2020."
There are conflicting reports. Last I heard was July or August with Dr Fauci expecting that this virus was going to act like other flu viruses and go down in the summer only to return in the fall. I re-booked to July rather than wait and see if my flight was going to get canceled. Events are getting re-booked for June and July in New York. Time will tell.
"Lisa M - still dreaming of some “at-the-gate” Covid 19 test, huh?You’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?"
Dr.Jim is absolutely right. There will be no normal until a vacine is developed. And that is a year or 18 months away at the earliest. However virus immune people may be able to travel and work. If they can assure that immunity is permanent. Which they are not sure of at this time .

Nepatriots that is what I also read that you will develop antibodies to the virus if we get infected by it and survive it. One of the things that make this virus so infective is because we have no immunity to it. It is new.
"Yeah, I'm a dog with a bone, oh Ray of sunshine. I guess you don't listen to the daily press briefings from the White House. They have developed I believe it is called the Abbott test, I could be wrong, but it can detect if a person is positive or negative in 5 minutes. Every person who is to come in contact with our President or VP gets tested. Our first responders are already getting access to these tests and expect them to be widely available within weeks, not months. So stop being such a negative Nancy. It's almost as though you want to destroy the global economy. Or maybe just America's."
"Why is NEPATRIOTS allowed to be so vile, hateful and nasty to another poster and yet TA leaves his posts up even after they are reported? I guess losing Tom Brady really put him over the edge ... LOL"
"Losing Tom Brady has put all of us here in New England over the edge... (trying to be light and funny here this morning....)As to a realistic timeline, there's wishful thinking and there's reality. My wishful thinking at this point is maybe June or July? Perhaps? My reality thinking is probably the Fall - October, November? We have a trip already booked to Anguilla for November, and if that's the only one we get to take this year, I'll be thankful. Be well, all.Edited: 10:05 am, April 05, 2020 "
"I'm feeling pretty sad about about a ""hold"" on our travel plans. First there was my husband's medical issues that caused us to cancel our trip last November, surgery three weeks ago, three months of restrictions (due to the surgery)...and now questions about how long Covid-19 will keep everyone on the planet confined and at home.I think in the interest of safety and not working myself into a ""travel frazzle"", we are not going to travel at all until we know for certain that the virus is a thing of the past. ...2021?(I guess in the long run my husband picked a good time to have medical issues that are keeping us close to home.) ~~~allfins ><>Edited: 10:51 am, April 05, 2020 "
Totally agree. There will be many peaks and valleys as this spreads. We're not even sure if we'll get to our home in Florida this fall. 2020 is going to be a long year.
"It really won't be safe again until a vaccine is developed, which will be a year away. I'm sure each country will go thru periods of gently lifting the local stay at home bans, only to see infection rates spike again locally, at which point people will be forced home again. But I cannot imagine any country will start letting foreigners travel in and out again until a vaccine is developed AND it's proven that the majority of people have received it."
"<< ""until a vaccine is developed AND it's proven that the majority of people have received it."" >>I wonder what the anti-vax nutters will have to say about this.:-0Edited: 12:36 pm, April 05, 2020 "
Guillain-Barré syndrome brought on by the swine flu vaccine. And hopefully not be repeated with this virus. Is why a year to 18 months is a realistic goal for a vaccine.
New York is at or near the Apex according to Cuomo. I was diagnosed with viral bronchitis (mild). I have no fever so I was not given the covid test. I was prescribed steroids and cough medicine to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms.
Wishing you a speedy recovery.
Thank you Nepatriots.
"If travel is allowed, we will be going *somewhere* in the fall sometime. My wife is a nurse and is already looking forward to getting to the other side of this and some stress relief. Yes, there is risk. But she works with that risk every day so if flights are flying and resorts are opening... we'll be there."
Flights might be going within the country but I would hope no country would be ignorant enough to let Americans in anytime soon. Our country has proven itself to be completely incompetent with this.
"Emily, I think that there will be a lot of psychological barriers to overcome before some people will fly or travel again. And I'm including myself in that group."

"Even when the vaccine becomes available, it won't be administered to all who request it - only to those who are the most at risk and, perhaps, medical workers. We're in a lockdown because we are hoping to ""flatten the curve"" and relieve the pressure on the healthcare infrastructure, and let's hope NOT until this strain completely goes away...because it won't anytime soon. People still get sick with swine flu, etc.,years after the initial outbreak. The real question is what will be left of the global economy once this is over. What will be left of the paradise that is TCI? And how many of us will be able to afford these paradise vacations? That's what keeps me up at night, not the threat of this particular virus to my health and well-being. I view life as a risky enterprise in general."
"I agree with Dr. Jim!  Bill gates is doing some incredible work too, building 7 different processing facilities to have the vaccines ready to go. depending on which of the 7 vaccine options works, he will be ready to help and get the vaccine out pronto! That is encouraging.Edited: 7:01 am, April 07, 2020 "

Ironically, this was the first year I got the flu shot because I happened to be in the doctor's office for something else and they said, ""Hey, we just got a shipment"" so I thought, ""Oh, what the heck"". Turns out, that flu shot didn't help with Flu B which circulated in January in NY . I've also had the pneumonia vaccines (2), which apparently don't work for Covid-19 pneumonia, who the heck understands why not, so I'm really really leary of vaccines. I am also really really leary of Bill Gates' motives, a man who has made great attempts to completely ruin our K-12 public schools via his Bill & Melinda Gates Corp. pushing Common Core and globalist NWO."

"<< ""I guess this is just more smoke and mirrors"" >>I won't risk going further off-topic on a travel forum, but i would suggest that you'll look smarter if you avoid making guesses regarding topics with which you are unfamiliar."
"<< ""Maybe there is a 5 minute test, maybe there isn't. "" >>According to the Abbott labs press release their new COVID 19 test platform can reduce time to results ""to as little as five minutes for positive results and 13 minutes for negative results.""So you're really looking at a test that is ""possibly"" as short as 13 minutes to find out whether the person tested is actually negative... which is what you're looking for.Let's add a few minutes for sample collection, thirteen minutes for each test, and a few minutes to clean the machine to prep for the next test. Just to make the math easy, let's call that 15 minutes per test. Let's further assume that a typical jet flying into TCI holds 200 passengers.Assuming that every gate at every airport has a machine, at 15 minutes per passenger, we're looking at 3,000 minutes to screen every passenger boarding a single commercial flight. Yes... that's 50 HOURS of testing time to board a SINGLE flight. Even though an assumption of a one machine at every gate is absurd, let's assume there's TWO machines. OK... only 25 hours. Four machines? Still gonna take 12 and a half hours to board a single flight. 8 machines? Now we're down to just over six hours of screening time to board ONE flight. Let's go crazy and assume there are SIXTEEN machines at every gate in the world. We're now down to adding ONLY three hours of screening time to board a single flight. If having ONE machine at every gate is crazy... what does that mean for requiring THIRTY TWO machines at every gate?Consider JFK airport, which typically sees about 160,000 passenger a day. That'd mean 2.5 MILLION extra minutes a day to test people. That's roughly 42,000 HOURS a day of testing time. Having enough machines to reduce the additional wait time for each flight to under 2hrs would require just north of 20,000 machines... AT JFK ALONE. Multiple that times how many airports around the world?Plus... where will we find the hundreds of thousands of trained/qualified healthcare workers to collect the samples, process the tests, etc.Sure when you say ""a five minute test"" that sounds simple enough.But when you do the math involved, it takes less than five minutes to realize that this is an entirely impractical idea."

"RJP,i knew better not to respond to Lisa M. That was a good decision. I know you from other Forums and I have a lot of respect for you!"
With everything that we ALL are going through.....why add NASTY comments on Trip Advisor to it? JUST STOP the BS and nasty posts !!
"TCILOVER - since you visit often, what's your best guess on when visitors will be able to return and when Providenciales will be back up and running? So many of us had to cancel trips - and want to reschedule as soon as we can, so I'd be interested in your thoughts. Thank you. :)"
"I have NO IDEA , I think it will follow the US . When people in the US feel confident to travel that will make a difference. Plus TCI, will have to feel confident they can accept visitors safely ."
"Let's make something perfectly clear. Many of us had to cancel our trips and are severely disappointed. Based on the information being updated daily, SOME of us are looking for a satisfactory safety measure to reopen international travel while minimizing risk of infection to point of travel. Hysterical hyperbolic posts like Ray's are NOT helpful. At least he finally admits there is a quick test available. Again, his ridiculous mathematical extrapolations are nothing but negativity. Having a test administered within 10 days of travel with a negative result should be sufficient to permit international travel. Period. Did any of you ever get a vaccine for Swine Flu? I know I didn't. Bird flu? West Nile Virus? I don't see this any differently, but I would concede to a test to allay the fears of the worried. Anything more than that, and even that, could be considered an assault on our civil liberties."
"Btw, the decision to reopen flights and borders needs to be made based on science, not ""feelings""."
"Thanks, TCILOVER. Your last sentence is key - I (or others) may want to travel somewhere, but it's going to depend on when the island/country feels confident that they can accept visitors safely. Until then, we can dream."
I re-booked for mid July but I won't know until I get closer if that will happen. My May flight was officially cancelled by American Airlines. We are starting to show a flattening of the Apex in New York City area. My area is about two weeks behind them. Could be sooner if people stay home.
"Vacay,We haven't reached peak apex yet in NYC, 792 deaths yesterday."
"Vacay567 - have you ever been in July? We loved it! Hazy, hot, humid, water calm and clear like a bathtub. Fingers crossed that you'll be able to go."
<< “peak apex” >>Has that description been approved by the Manager of Approval Management of the Division of the Department of Redundant Terminology Management Department?:-)
I am just going by what the news has been reporting Lisa. No Muylinda I have never been to anywhere in the Caribbean in July. I am hoping it works out.
"Ray,That was redundant, wasn't it ... LOL. I can laugh at myself. But we can't say we have flattened the curve when the # of deaths is still increasing. We need to get over the peak before we can claim the curve has been flattened. Colorado and DC are behind NYC."
"I really can't figure out why there is so much discussion about this. when Lover said ""I have no idea"". Bingo! It's a wait and see. There really is no projections."
"Oh hey there, Suffolk County! We can speculate. Why not? Broadway just announced it's staying shut until June 7th."
"In stressful times, it is comforting to have a plan. Now...no one can plan anything, and that is more frustrating! Although our Costa Rica trip was cancelled for late April due to the complete and utter world chaos...I continue to book and hope for travel. I have not booked any flying trips...that's a little out of my comfort zone right now with all of the flight cancellations. But...I'm booking non prepay hotels, and hope to be back on my travel plans soon.Many of us on this particular forum topic seem to be from New York,US...1 upstate, most downstate. Daily, we hear reports on the news of amazing loss of life. It is so very sad.However, making a plan gives comfort. Make cancellable travel plans-we have NO IDEA!!! (thanks lyonfish) 1 month ago we all planned to travel as usual. We will be there again."
"@Lisa M... actually, in that Broadway article for 6/7 they also said ""or 4th of July, or after Labor Day""...it could be bad-and we are big theater people!!!"
Lisa the Apex is the highest number of confirmed cases in an area. Not the number of deaths in a day. Is it true that people in NYC are still riding on crowded transit?
"I'm sorry Vacay, but you are incorrect, specifically referring to apex data for NYS re: deaths: https:/…I live in the suburbs on over half an acre of property. I have not left my property since March 7th. What in God's name do NYC subways have to do with me?Edited: 11:42 pm, April 08, 2020 "
Doesn't everything have to be about you ? Give it a rest.
Lisa it had to do with the spread of the virus in NYC. The death toll is a lag of previously reported covid-19 dx.
"Vacay,Determining the apex refers to the peak number of deaths, not the number of people who test positive. You are confused. We are still ascending to the apex in terms of number of deaths. There may be millions of people who had the virus but never got tested for it. The apex refers to number of deaths from Covid-19. Many of those deaths may not have tested positive prior to hospitalization. When we get 3/4 of the way on the downside of the apex death toll is when things will start to open back up.I'm not going to get baited into a racist argument about who is riding the NYC subways or buses in Detroit. I see pictures of people dropping their gloves on sidewalks and in parking lots. It's disgusting. Did you see the heartbreaking video of the bus driver in Detroit? Absolutely tragic. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliare…nepatriotsShhhhhh. Quiet time."
"Any statement or article simply saying “the apex of COVID 19” without defining what metric they are considering — total cases, new cases, deaths, whatever — is completely ambiguous.So no sense in arguing about it."
"Ray,Except the link I provided DID list the apex metric as deaths. I guess you didn't read it. https:/…"
"Lisa when Cuomo talks about it on tv, it is about new cases."
"Vacay,LOL! Sorry, I am physically unable to listen to Cuomo's voice. He's the last source (well, maybe 2nd to last after CNN) that I would tune into for info. I did accidentally leave the sound on the other day and heard him say that ""we don't have any non-covid patients because there aren't any auto accidents"" which is the most untrue, idiotic statement I've ever heard, especially since my daughter had been admitted for a non-Covid emergency procedure last Friday. No heart attacks? No strokes? No burns or broken bones? Worst Governor ever."

"The one good thing I have learned from this forum is when the most hateful posters in these fora visit TCI and to avoid those months. We decided where to stay initially based on TripAdvisor reviews and have been totally satisfied with our choice. I'm glad we rebooked for after the November election. I'm leaving these pages as I find the level of TDS disturbing. I was lectured for mentioning something political in a post, yet the gang of you are allowed to freely insult and name-call without repercussion. I hope none of you have to have your child admitted to a hospital during this pandemic and not be able to visit with them, as I did. Peace out."
Your sense of irony needs real work.
