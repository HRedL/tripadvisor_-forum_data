Is it safe to travel in Johannesburg and Cape Town in April? What is the tourism scene like right now?
"Safe in respect of covid-19 or other concerns?If covid-19, keep an eye on these two threads:https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowTopic-g312…https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/ShowTopic-g312…"
"A very broad question.Which aspects of safety, and the tourism industry in South Africa, would you like to know about?"
"Thanks for your queries. I in particular am concerned about coronavirus as I am travelling with an infant and you just can't be careful enough with them. On the other hand I really do not want to cancel my trip just because of mass panic. So I am wondering what is the scene actually like in south Africa? As in here in Mumbai, people are living quite the normal life with no fear of a pandemic. It hasn't hit us here, atleast until now.."
"** here in Mumbai, people are living quite the normal life with no fear of a pandemic. **Here as well.Just keep your distance from anyone coughing and sneezing, do not touch your face, and was hands well, and frequently."
"You cant keep your distance distance from anyone unless you self isolate as it is impossible,especially in a plane walking up the aisle to visit toilets which are Unisex and quite unhygienic at the best of times.The airline attendants can't remote serve food and drinks and people sneeze spontaneously.Trite comments are not adding anything! Basically its a choice of risk factors whether to cancel or not and that is entirely up to each and everyone to decide or in some cases destinations are banned so its a no brainer,"
"The OP asked about the situation in South Africa, and whether there is mass panic: ""I really do not want to cancel my trip just because of mass panic. So I am wondering what is the scene actually like in south Africa? As in here in Mumbai, people are living quite the normal life with no fear of a pandemic. It hasn't hit us here, atleast until now.""To which I replied, based on what is happening here, in my town, as of right now.OP did NOT ask about conditions in aircraft!"
"I refer to the ""Just keep your distance from anyone coughing and sneezing, do not touch your face, and was hands well, and frequently. "" Really ? !"
"** Really?!**Yes,REALLY!!Advice from the NHS, and WHO:How to avoid catching or spreading coronavirusDowash your hands with soap and water often – do this for at least 20 secondsalways wash your hands when you get home or into workuse hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not availablecover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneezeput used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwardstry to avoid close contact with people who are unwellDon'tdo not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean"
