"In the midst of a deadly coronavirus outbreak centered around Wuhan in Hubei Province, China, two voyages on Spectrum of the Seas from Shanghai, China, have been been cancelled. These short “Best of Japan"" cruises were slated to depart today as well as on January 30.Jonathon Fishman, manager, corporate reputation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., told Travel Agent this morning: ""In light of the latest developments with the coronavirus outbreak in China, we are suspending the January 27 and January 31 sailings of Spectrum of the Seas, currently our only ship homeported in China. We are working with our guests to provide full refunds for the cancellation. The health and safety of our guests and crew is our primary concern, and we continue to work with the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, and government health authorities to monitor the situation.""Costa Cruises also cancelled last Saturday's cruise of Costa Serena from Tianjin....Read the link below for the complete article...https://www.travelagentcentral.com/cruises/m…Edited: 9:07 pm, January 27, 2020 "
"Kind of late for that kind of decision. Their guests are most likely already enroute. Now they have to re-book hotels, flights, etc with no lead time. If they are just getting a refund, they'll still have to spend big bucks. Hope they have travel insurance."
Surf I think you're correct.Very similar info to what I posted this morning (AEST) on this post.https:/…105149538
"Smart Traveller:""Overall advice level: Exercise normal safety precautions"""
"As of today the Aust Govt has advised people not to travel to China. This is not only due to the virus, but also due to the possibility that anywhere in China may be locked down and you may be stuck.We are due to leave from Singapore in April on a Princess cruise that is due to finish in Shanghai, which is the only Chinese port (not counting Hong Kong). I'll be interested to see what Princess do as it now appears Chinese ports will have to be cut. We were flying back to Aust from Shanghai after three days there post cruise so that will likely have to be changed...but I hope the cruise goes ahead. The last three ports were Nagasaki, Busan and finally Shanghai so I'm hoping they can rework those and we just finish in Japan. We have done a few cruises of late and I think this one is doomed. Last year we had this one booked and I had to cancel due to a hospital stay and now this.Edited: 4:25 pm, January 28, 2020 "
"@PerfectlyPerth #4 - regarding insurance, just about every company does not cover for epidemics such as viruses. I checked mine yesterday (CoverMore) and they don't. There is an exclusion paragraph about viruses, epidemics etc at the end of just about every item that they cover."
GraemeGCThe Circle Pacific leaves Sydney 15th April and has some of the same ports as your cruise - it will be interesting to see what Princess does.
"GraemeGCRe your post and insurance, does Covermore have a statement stating you can ""cancel for any reason"" ?"
I just received this article regarding trip insurance...https:/…coronavirus-travel-insurance-faqs
We are scheduled on the Crystal Symphony on February 15th. We have been told they are not canceling the cruise and we are not being offered refunds or vouchers for a future cruise. :-(
"That's still more than 2 weeks away mfb. It's a very fluid situation, no other lines have cancelled cruises that far in advance as yet either. It really will depend on how the situation develops. The cruise line isn't going to sail if the ports are closed, should the situation deteriorate further"
"Thanks JudyI don't know if many - or any - travel insurances offered in Australia have the ""cancel for any reason"" policy included."
MFBI saw they were not stopping in Hong Kong for embarkation are they assisting you for the new embarkation port ?
"lht,Where have you seen that Crystal have dropped Hong Kong? I have found no reference to that. I am sailing with them from HK 16 March."
"@DougOz - yes I did take the cancel for any reason option on my CoverMore policy. This option is a recent introduction from them and they are one of the few (perhaps only) companies that offer this in Australia at this point in time. After my cancer diagnosis, which is fortunately much improved, this option gives me far more benefit than I could get before.So yes, I am covered although I think cancel for any reason on CoverMore covers only 75% of the costs up to a $10k limit."
GraemeGCGood to know about that option - thanks for that info and best wishes for your continued improvement.
Cheers DougoOz. Immunotherapy is a wonder treatment if it works as it is for me. Of course people's health comes first but I hope our cruises happen. I'm just waiting to see what Princess do as it seems pretty clear that Shanghai will have to be replaced. The stop prior is Busan and I'm not sure if that port and airport is set up to start/finish cruises. I haven't been to Yokohama/Tokyo so I'm hoping they just finish there.I guess we just have to wait and see. I'm happy to just go where the cruise takes me and I'll adjust flights and accommodation as needs be.
"Frommy it was on the CC in the Crystal forum plus someone mentioned they checked into their PCPC account on the crystal website & it was noted that Taiwan is the new embarkation port This was for the Serenity scroll down the page https:/…Edited: 10:46 pm, January 28, 2020 "
a couple of news stories on CChttps://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5016/https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5026/
Frommy Sorry I meant the change was for the Symphony
"""it was noted that Taiwan is the new embarkation port ""Ha ha. That was me. The roll call noted a change to the itinerary on the sign in page and I followed that up with Crystal directly then posted to the CC Crystal pages as well.Your information was posted a few hours before I became informed though. Thanks.Edited: 2:00 am, January 29, 2020 "
FROMMY as long as you got the info all is good
"The Holland America Westerdam, originally scheduled to depart 29 Feb 2020 from Shanghai had a China focused itinerary. As a result of the coronavirus spread, HA has just changed embarkation to Yokohama and canceled all Chinese ports except those on Taiwan. This results in dramatically different cruise than passengers had signed up for originally. Nonetheless, HA, citing its discretion under the ""safety"" provisions of the tickets sold, refuses to offer passengers an option to cancel for refunds and takes the position that passengers will forfeit the entirety of their cruise payments if they do not elect the alternative voyage unilaterally selected by Holland America. This alternative basically circles Japan for 30 days with two short stops in Korea.It is likely that there are passengers from mainland China who are booked on the cruise since it was originally scheduled to embark from Shanghai. However, Holland America informed me it will only use a questionnaire to screen for coronavirus for those not showing symptoms (such as a fever). Of course this can be a big problem for the passengers and crew of almost 4000 since the symptoms may not appear for up to 14 days but those infected are still contagious while not showing symptoms.This is in complete contrast to the way many reputable cruise lines have handled the crisis, where refunds are now offered when the cruise lines are unable to safely provide a China itinerary. This speaks volumes about Holland America's attitudes towards its customers and will certainly influence my decisions regarding selection of cruise lines in the future."
"Thanks for the links LHT - good information in there IMO.jrsedthanks for your information about HAL - interesting that they choose not to give people the option of cancelling with a refund or changing to a different itinerary.A recent thread on the Sydney (Australia) forum highlighting the need for Travel Insurance which covers ""cancel for any reason"". - https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g25…"

"Good info, jrsed, and welcome to the forum. Luckily, the cruise line has four weeks to gather more data on danger and to establish appropriate policies for vetting passengers."
We have received an email that our cruise on Sapphire Princess that was due to finish in Shanghai on 2 May will now not visit Shanghai and finish in Yokohama. I assume that the next cruise that was due to depart Shanghai will also be affected.
"GraemeYes it is affected. I saw a post on FB from another Aussie where Princess has offered them a full refund as has the airline, however the Agent he booked with wants to keep the lion's share of the monies paid !"
"@DougOz - no mention at all of a refund in the email I received from Princess. Just a simple advice about the disembarkation port change. Mind you, I am keen to do the cruise and don't want a refund if possible.If anything an upgrade as I expect plenty of cabins to become available as today is final payment day for most.Edited: 6:15 am, January 30, 2020 "
".Just had a newsflash that the Costa Smeralda is on lock-down at Civitavecchia with 7,000 people on board, as a Chinese couple have developed fevers and breathing difficulties - and so, potentially, the Coronavirus.."
i see on CC some lines are issuing statement that if you were in China in the last 30 days you will denied boarding & also if you have a temp of or more 38C or 101.4 F you will be denied boarding  I guess Costa did not screen their pax or they lied about being in China
Not included in standard policy it is an additional extra
"Yesterday, Princess put up a statement on their website about the Coronavirus indicating which ships have had a turnaround city change in lieu of Shanghai.Other sailings where Shanghai was a stop are being changed and in our case, we will most likely get another port in Japan.https:/…coronavirus-update.html"
The NZ Govt today advised that the NZ Border is closed to foreigners who have been to or transited China in the past 15 days. This policy will be reviewed every 48 hours.
Crystal have changed the embarkation port to Taiwan on 16 march
Have you been able to get any insurance cover or did you get insurance early?
"@enneiviv - I notice you are in Oz so just a general comment re insurance. You can out travel insurance any time up to the trip, although you are only covered for things booked after you take out the policy. If you are referring to Cancel for any Reason insurance, this has to be booked when you book the trip, or within a day or two I recall. You would have no chance of adding this now.Edited: 12:59 am, February 04, 2020 "
"I slightly disagree. You could certainly now purchase travel insurance, but it would be worthless if you tried to claim anything related to nCoV."
Japan has ordered Diamond Princess into quarantine after a passenger who disembarked in HK has been found positive to nCoV.https://tinyurl.com/tjaj8oy
@Frommy post #41 - I might have worded it badly but my point was that you cannot just add Cancel for any Reason coverage later on. It has to be purchased when you first purchase the policy.Otherwise anyone with any concerns about Coronavirus could now rush off and get Cancel for any Reason cover and then just cancel. I took out this cover for my Asian trip months ago when I booked and I am covered if I cancel - for any reason.
"Yes, but “cancel for any reason” usually is only 80% return but that’s way better than 0%.I have been buying it for several years, only costs a bit more, but worth the peace of mind to me."
"Graeme,My point was that the OP can still purchase it, but it would be as useless as t,ts on a bull. I agree with your points at #43, but I think you missed my point that you could buy insurance, not that you can't, and some silly people will actually do that. There have been several posting on the Air Travel and Cruises forums, and on my CC roll call for an upcoming Taipei/Japan cruise, who have seriously considered foolishly doing so."
there is an update on CC on what the various lines are doingseems some are not allowing pax that transitted through HK onboard https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5016/
"@GraemeGC So if you not canceling the cruise, you will have to pay for new airfare from Tokyo yourself right? Since your policy is include cancel for any reason but you are not cancelling. Asking because I m on that cruise as well."
OZ 138 have you checked with your cruise line to see if they are offering some compensations for having to change flights to the new port of embarkation/disembarkation?
They do $250 per stateroom
"Oz138 post #47 - this is one of the rare cruises we have done where we used the Princess EZair option so the Singapore Airlines flights are booked through them. The email I received from Princess is that they will re-book the flights now from Tokyo and that there is no charge. If you are using a TA I'd get them to sort this out for you, if not, I'd be on to the airlines. A number are allowing people to change as the Govt now requests we do not go to China. If you were booked Singapore Airlines they have flights back from Tokyo via Singapore, which are similar times to what you would have had from Shanghai, and Qantas have direct flights from Tokyo to Brisbane every day. We are staying 4 days in Tokyo post cruise."
"@GraemeGCLucky you!! I booked with SA before I found out about Eziair.Called SA and they only waive change fee up to travel date 29 Feb. Will wait to see if SA will extend date otherwise will have to pay change fee plus price different. Now that all of this happened I read my PDS properly, I dont think I would be cover for flight change, delay or cancellation anyway.I m thinking of buying add on for this feature but not sure how will the new cover work since I have not purchased my new flight yet.I know if it related to to the virus I wont be cover. I am cover for medical and emergency and all that but now worry that if my flight delay or cancel and I cant get to the port in time and vice versa."
"@Oz138I think that for sure SIA will have to extend the date. It was 5 Feb initially and then they extended to 29 Feb. After all our Govt is saying don't go to China so I don't really think SIA have a choice. Of course the worry is that flights will fill up, but I doubt it. My calls to SIA would be quite frequent though until they changed the flights."
"Princess Diamond now has 10 pax testing positive for the Coronavirus. Hope does not get worse onboard.the good news is a person was released from the hospital having fully recovered, so it’s not guaranteed worst outcome."
Princess Cruises are horrible.Refuse to give even a credit for our Asia cruise March 12 that has every port infected with the coronavirus. Terrible customer service and attitude.No regard for their passengers. Do not seem to care they will lose so much future business because of the spread of ill will. Wow.
"Wander, welcome to the Cruise forum with your first post, What did your travel insurance say ?"
"Hang in there, Wander. The way things are going now, your cruise could end up being cancelled anyway, in which case you would get full refund. I would just wait and see what happens over next 2-3 weeks."
"Wander: Also note that w/regard to passengers whose cruises have been cancelled due to 14 day quarantine of Diamond Princess in Yokohama, Princess is apparently giving full refund PLUS credit for free future cruise. Am not sure I read that correctly as seems too good to be true, but you can check the press release yourself on the Princess website. So I wouldn't rush to cancel right now."
WANDER # 54Your cruise may not be cancelled but the itinerary may change a lot This situation is very fluid at the moment & if the ports have a high rate of illness due to the virus they will be changed people have to patient ..the cruise lines are all trying to keep their pax safe & finding new ports is not that easy in the current situation
QQ2 I believe it is just for the Feb 4 https:/…diamond-princess-update.html
"Thanks, yes I noticed that when I looked at it a second time."
"This is all well and good but there is more to a cruise than just the cruise. You have airline tickets that are difficult to get anything back on,especially at the last second. I called Singapore Air and they issued me a credit for a future flight without penalty,as they should have. You also have your life to live and schedules. They should have honored my request for a credit for a future cruise. I did not ask for a refund. Their complete lack of understanding of how to keep a customer is astounding to me. By refusing to simply issue a credit,how much future income have they lost from me,my family and others that I speak to?Edited: 12:39 pm, February 05, 2020 "
WANDERGood you got an air creditthe virus is changing circumstances of travellers by the minute If you cannot get any relief from travel insurance you are out of pocket if you cancel but doubtful the cruise line will cancel the cruise Many lines are scrambling to change the itineraries
"I booked the cruise because of the itinerary. I do not want another itinerary. Princess should have some common sense and do the right thing by it’s customers. I guess that is too much to ask.What is not too much is for them to know they will lose many future customers and that I will do everything in my power and through social media to make that happen. This is just not acceptable to me.They are being completely unreasonable and that will come with a cost.Edited: 2:42 pm, February 05, 2020 "
This is just my opinion I think all cruise lines should pull out of Asia for the foreseeable future Cancel all upcoming cruises there & take the ship for a deep clean then to another part of the World They could offer a refund & hope the company survives this Does not appear to be an end in sight with the virus still spreadingMore cases seem to be popping up dailyhttps:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Maybe not feasible with so many ships now but they need to do something
I think the cruise lines would be having some very serious managers meetings.The running cost of these ships would be mind boggling and just to say let’s go somewhere else would be a courageous decision.With SARS a few relocated to Australia but I think there’s a lot more ships in the equation now and australia is a small market.
"I am booked on Crystal Symphony for what originally was a round trip Hong Kong cruise, so my flights are to/from HKG as well as accommodation bookings. That cruise was diverted to sail from Keelung, Taiwan, and I decided to keep the HK arrangements taking additional flights HKG/TPE. As of today the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control have announced this:""Starting from February 6, travelers with a history of travel to China, Hong Kong and Macau are required to be under home quarantine after entering Taiwan. Nonetheless, travelers returning to Taiwan who were permitted to visit Hong Kong and Macau are required to conduct self-health management for 14 days.""I have referred this to Crystal, Sydney, who have relayed it to the head office for further advice.It would now be very good for us if the Australian Government issued a ""Do not travel"" warning for HK and for Crystal to cancel the cruise, but I would think there would be a snowballs chance in hell of that happening."
Diamond Princess is now up to 20 cases of the virus and total will probably go up...all passengers quarantined in cabins for 14 days...agree with 64...just get out of the market.
yes Surf good point 14 days at minimum.
time for the cruise lines to rethink Asia cruises for the next few months with all the changing of ports & people having to change flights ports not allowing ships that have been to HK and other ports I wonder if it is really worth all the agro for pax & the logistical nightmare the cruise line must be going through JMO
"@Iht28 - I can see where you are coming from but I hope they don't skip Asia, although I am coming from the position of someone who has an Asian cruise booked in April. Our cruise has already been changed from ending in Shanghai to Yokohama and that doesn't worry me at all.I have had to change my accommodation post cruise to Shanghai to Tokyo and my return flights but I certainly was not stressed about it. Quite easy to do.Of course things might change but it seems to me things are pretty well contained outside of China now. Just the way it is from my viewpoint at the moment."
The cruise lines have a simple solution called refunds or full credits.
Taiwan bans all cruise ships:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hea…
"Wander770029""I booked the cruise because of the itinerary. I do not want another itinerary. ""... just as pretty much every cruiser does ...but if you read your Contract of Passage, the cruise line reserves the right to change the itinerary ... that's the chance you take when you book a cruise regardless of whether or not there's a Pandemic or not.FormmyThanks for the link re Taiwan ... I think it's a matter of time before more countries in SE Asia ban ships. Given that our cruise in has some 5 ports in Japan on it's intermarry in May this year, I suspect after the Diamond Princess they may change their tune...the only thing in our favour is that boarding for this cruise is Sydney however the next leg is from Yokohama !Re cancelling cruises ...It wouldn't surprise me if I hear of cancellations due to ""medical reasons"" ... easy enough if you do have a pre-existing medical issue and a sympathetic Dr !!"
Hi. I’ve just returned from a South Pacific Cruise on Carnival Splendor and unfortunately we had itinerary changes due to Coronavirus. I’m interested to know if the Carnival Spirit was able to visit Isle of Pines on it’s 11 night cruise January/February 2020 & would appreciate hearing from anyone who was a passenger on Spirit.
"Diamond Princess had been staying off shore in Port of Yokoahama until yesterday (Feb 5). She docked today in Daikoku Wharf for food and drink supply. Over 3,000 passengers and crews are requested on board. Passengers remain in their own cabin room. Meals are served to the room. Today, those in the room without window are permitted to leave room on the condition that they wear mask on and sanitize their hands for certain period of time. 20 infectious passengers and a crew were hospitalized on shore."
Holland America's Westerdam was refused to dock by the Philippines and Taiwan. It may be similar in Japan.
more newshttps://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5057/https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5066/It is not looking good for cruises in South pacific either
Graeme I wish you luck with the cruise it seems more cases popping up daily even outside China Frommy I see Crystal is in limbo for now hope they find a port to dock at
"Well,we booked a cruise through Asia. Are they going to change the itinerary to the Caribbean?I do not believe they have that right and every scheduled port is infected,so I don’t think so.Again,that would be the absolute worst customer relations thing they could possibly do. It is one thing to slightly change an itinerary dues to weather and another when there is no safe option due to the coronavirus and all of the unknowns."
"Hey Princess,do you see a problem here? Unbelievable."
"Well boo hoo, Wander. Just suck it up like everyone else. It is not the fault of Princess and it is clearly stated in every cruise lines T & C's that there may be changes in itinerary due to circumstances beyond there control. If they can't provide a similar cruise from the same port it will be cancelled.I would not cancel the cruise and if you want a refund wait until they cancel and you will receive that and credits towards another cruise."
"Well the problem is I can care less if they think it is safe. So people just have to wait until the last second and now are in a world of hurt with flights,hotels,etc. If passengers have a legitimate concern for their health like a global health emergency, they should be accommodated. They can write all the fine print that is 100 pct skewered to their profit they want, it does not make it right.A business that does not offer good will to it’s customers will suffer. It is clear Princess will only act if forced by the government. That is their attitudeEdited: 3:29 pm, February 06, 2020 "
"Wander, obviously you’re new to cruising. Your moaning on and on changes nothing. You are unfamiliar with your own cruise contract you signed and agreed to. That’s your fault.You chose not to purchase travel insurance. Also your responsibility.The entire cruise industry is not going to change its business model MO because Wander just showed up on the scene and he knows better than anyone else what’s supposed to happen when Himself is displaced or inconvenienced. It’s only a global emergency.Of course, your travel plans are paramount to the cruise industry during this time.Do you even “get” how you are portraying yourself here ?Edited: 4:37 pm, February 06, 2020 "
WANDER You can cancel anytime you choose If you want a full refund I would wait to see if the cruise line will cancelIf you can still get a partial refund then cancel now & get on with life If you have hotels/tours booked in the affected Countries cancel now if refundable If you are not getting a refund if you cancel the cruise now then wait until just before sailing date & cancel either way you will be out of pocket unless the cruise line cancel that sailingYou have to make the choice that works for you Many people from many ships are all playing the waiting game https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5057/
Thanks again Iht28 for reposting that useful link.
"Wanderer This virus is bigger than you, me and every cruiser ... it's impacting on tourism in general and businesses all around the world.I think now that the HAL ship has been denied entry to Japanese ports, other lines will be scrambling to put together a different itinerary ... or cancel.I think it's a waiting game to see if the cruise will be cancelled so sit tight and wait. With the precautions cruise lines are taking about restricting passengers from boarding, your biggest threat once on board is not Coronavirus but other illnesses that passengers can contract such as a cold or flu or gastro type illnesses. With all these types of illnesses, personal hygiene is paramount - washing hands with soap - regularly, not touching your face (mouth, eyes etc with unwashed hands) and using the toilet in your cabin rather than a pubic toilet.Just sit tight and wait. If the cruise goes ahead, go with an open mind and enjoy it."
"Crystal Symphony is now replacing Keelung, Taiwan with Singapore and offering credit on future cruises if wishing to cancel. That suits me."
Frommy Let's hope more lines see the light & at least offer a refund or FCCIf I was on one of those sailings I would probably cancel & take the hit rather than worry about getting sick or even getting to the ports but that is just me
"lht,I did not mention that Crystal are offering 50% refund by way of FCC if current bookings are retained, but I have had a gutfull of all this and decided to pull the plug. It also developed that many things I would have liked to do in the additional Japanese ports require a lot of walking, which would have been beyond me, so I have no regrets.I have already arranged to book a cruise March next year Mombasa to Cape Town. African wildlife parks do not require much walking. :)"
FROMMY Yes I saw on CC the offer but I think or wonder if any ports will be open Many Countries are now just stopping ships from docking in fear of the spread of the virus so even if you took the cruise would anyone be allowed off It is scary times we live in
"That was also a consideration in my decision, as well as would airlines still be flying from the terminating port? Virgin Australia is pulling out of Hong Kong completely.Edited: 6:45 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"@Frommy - Virgin Australia is pulling out of Hong Kong as the route was not commercially viable. I read their press release a while back that said the unrest in HK had lessened demand, and the virus scare just added to it. They are introducing routes to Tokyo in its place."
"I am aware of that, Graeme, that I why I said ""completely"", although I am remiss for not mentioning economic reasons, but that has also been compounded by the 2019-nCoV."
"Thankfully we now have a direction as to where our cruise (Circle Pacific in April) is heading.Princess has pulled the plug on Shanghai a couple of weeks ago and now Hong Kong has been deleted from the Itinerary. Two ""replacement"" ports in Korea are now on the itinerary and in the South Pacific on the homeward cruise, Pago Pago has been cancelled and replaced with Moorea.So we are still sailing with the same number of ports (at this stage) and our ports in Japan are remain as is .. which I think is primarily because we have 22 days cruising prior to reaching Japan and all passengers are boarding in either Auckland, Sydney or Brisbane.There have been some tweaks re arrival/departure times in other ports but nothing really of any concern and in addition, Princess are giving each passenger another $US250 refundable OBC ""as a gesture of goodwill"". Happy with that !!"
"@DougOz - interesting. Our cruise from Singapore leaving 16 April was due to finish in Shanghai which was changed to Yokohama some days ago. I expected Hong Kong to be cut as well and I see they have now cut it from your stops. Hopefully there is somewhere between Chan May and Taipei where they can stop, otherwise it may be three straight sea days."
"GraemeGCSome people received emails from Princess but somehow or other they missed sending one to me even tho' I booked directly with Princess The information was on the ""itinerary"" tab of the booking the cruise personaliser ... scroll down to the bottom to ""Important notices"" ... it was at the end of that section, You may have something there already because this is what our notice started off with (then went on to tell us about the port changes etc.""Please be advised that due to a U.S. State Department travel warning to China as a result of Coronavirus, Sun Princess' calls to Hong Kong, China and Shanghai, China have been cancelled. ""Edited: 7:43 am, February 08, 2020 "
"DougOzNothing on the Personaliser yet. The itinerary tab took a few days to update after we had received emails about finishing in Yokohama and swapping the calls at Busan and Nagasaki. However no updates or emails about HK yet.Is one of your new Sth Korean ports Jeju or was that on the itinerary anyway? I wouldn't mind going there if our itinerary gets changed further, which I expect after HK gets cut."
"GraemeGC If Princess have provided you information about visas etc, any notifications should be in that same area... strange that they haven't updated your sailing as yet.Yes our two new ports in SE Asia are Je-Ju (Seogwipo) and Incheon (for Soeul) in lieu of Hong Kong and Shanghai. So no new Japanese ports have been added although we were initially advised there would be one substituted for Shanghai.We've also had Pago Pago dropped due to ""strict health clearance procedures"" and Moorea added in its place.The segment of the Pacific Circle - Sydney to Yokohama has come down in price - Princess sent our emails about it yesterday - departs on 15th April."
there was an update on CC posted last night on the different lines and new procedures and itinerarieshttps://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5016/
LHTThat's a good link - thanks for posting it
The problem is the situation is changing faster than the article can be changed. Crystal is still shown as docking Keelung but that has been changed to Singapore since Taiwan stopped all cruise ships calling there as at about five days ago.

"Yeah, Dougo, it certainly is tasty, if they will still be able to do it. I have no regrets for cancelling, and Spirit of Tasmania booked already. :)"
"We are booked on the 17 Feb sailing of the Norwegian Jade and very disappointed that NCL is not offering full refunds. We have decided not to go, even if we have to kiss over $3000 goodbye. I read this morning that the Norwegian Spirit is cancelling their Asian itinerary, so all we can hope for is that the Norwegian Jade follows suit. As far as I can tell, we have no legal recourse to force reimbursement, so we are at the mercy of NCL's decisions. I hate to knock NCL for this, because we have had nice experiences with them in the past. But NCL needs to know that this will be our very last booking with them or with any Carnival-owned cruise, unless they come through and allow refunds. Contacting NCL is nearly imposssible. If anyone has an email contact for them, it would be much appreciated."
"FrommyPop into the Myanmar forum for hints, and don't worry about a Visa as they are issued on arrivalEnjoy Myanmar,it is special-but I am biased.SS"
"SS,Please read more carefully - I cancelled the cruise before this itinerary was decided on. See the first line of Post #105."

"Various news here have reported that Princess Cruise announced they will refund all the fare to the passengers of Diamond Princess in Yokohama. The fare includes cruise excursion, air fare, hotels, shuttles, etc."
The itinerary for Norwegian Jade was sailing from Singapore round trip porting in Vietnam and Thailand.
"ETFlyer: Princess is refunding the entire cruise fare to all passengers, along with a 100% future cruise credit in the amount of the cruise fare. Princess is also fully refunding all pre/post cruise hotels and airfare booked through then, and supplying a ""reasonable"" refund to those who booked independently, with spot to submit receipts for consideration. They are also refunding all onboard purchases such as Excursions and drink packages (not shops). They are providing 100% free internet during quarantine, and refunding any purchased packages from the actual cruise. While the situation is virtually unprecedented, they're doing the best they can..."
I’m on the same cruise. I have standard insurance. I’m recovering from bronchitis and coughing a lot so I’m going to get a doctor’s note... because I would certainly be quarantined with this cough. I’m hoping they don’t give me a hard time. I’m just very uncomfortable about the whole thing. They moved port to Singapore but Singapore has more cases of corona virus than Hong Kong... today they have 43 cases. ... I. Feel like they are putting our lives in jeopardy.
more cases on Diamond Princesshttps://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/66-more…
Just saw that the Westerdam who was suppose to disembark pax in Bangkok on Thus have now been turned away Those poor people stuck onboard with no port allowing them to dockhttps:/…
"That one is very confusing to me, lht, as reports I have read state the no one on board Westerdam is affected by 2019-nCoV."
FROMMY I agree everything I have seen says they have no illness onboard yet Countries will not allow her to dock Yet they are allowing Crystal to dock in Singapore this week
"Just saw that Japan got results back from 53 additional Diamond Princess tests... 39 showed infection, INCLUDING one local quarantine official. 174 total now. I don't blame smaller, less sophisticated countries from wanting nothing to do with cruise ships for now. Of course, some of those countries probably have infections and don't realize it (and maybe don't want to know - if you have no testing capability, you still look clear on those maps).My concern is that there may be a number of carriers with limited symptoms (like the trigger for the cases in France, Spain, and UK). I think this is what port authorities are most concerned about with Westerdam; the big block of passengers getting on in Hong Kong could have someone like that.The somewhat positive news is that so far only four of those infected from DP have shown major issues (needing oxygen or ICU) so far."
"Looks like princess has bookings for diamond princess in Perth,Sydney over winter."
"Thailand is not a small, unsophisticated country."
"No big deal. The important thing is the cruise lines make more money. Who cares if these ships are the easiest way to spread the disease? My cruise is going to Singapore,Thailand,Vietnam and Hong Kong. Of course I won’t be on it. Princess has lost customers for life and they deserve to lose a lot more.Edited: 10:53 pm, February 11, 2020 "
"Wander - I'm curious what your Voyage number is, as cruises on Diamond have been cancelled though March 12 - which covers the date you mentioned earlier. And new info is coming basically daily, as the situation unfold. Basically no other lines have cancelled cruises that far in advance, except one NCL ship...Good luck in your future sails. Glad you have travel insurance to cover the unexpected (or at least I assume you do, can't imagine traveling without it)...Happy sails"
Wander - as far as I'm concerned Princess are doing a good job managing this. I'm on a Princess cruise from Singapore mid-April and they have changed the disembarkation port. Plenty of notice.Personally I think you just need a sedative and a good lie down.

I think it will be good odds Voyeger will stay in Sydney over the southern winter
Hopefully good news for HAL Westerdam https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5074/Celebrity has cancelled at least the next 2 cruises on the Millennium dropped of pax in Singapore yesterday
"I booked a cruise with Iglu Cruises and want to cancel but they are not answering the phone or replying to emails. If I want to book a cruise they answer in10 secs. Once they have your money, they don’t want to know. Totally powerless. Will never do this again."
"Sandra - I'm not understanding your post. How does Iglu know what you're calling about just by the ring? If they answer in 10 seconds when you want to book but don't answer at all when you want to cancel, how do they know that's why you're calling?"
"We are scheduled on the same cruise, now disembarking in Tokyo. Let mr knowing you hear that it is cancelled.I suspect it will be. Norwegian cancelled all of its Asia cruises until Dec."
If you ring to book you press option 1 but if you have an existing booking you have to press option 2They answer option 1 in 10 secs but option 2 is not answered. I asked the chap on the booking line to transfer me to the people in Customer Services with an existing booking but NO CHANCE so I am stuck.
You will not believe this - Have been trying to cancel my cruise now for 6 days. Cannot speak to Customer Services so I have emailed many times and today I have a reply! It has sent me out my booking confirmation again and is wishing me a lovely cruise!Can anyone help me - I just want to cancel.
"Hi Sandra. People are having great difficulties contacting third parties about flights as well. I guess that the situation, with cancelled flights, travel bans etc is having a massive effect which will include companies being snowed under with requests for refunds, cancellations, and just information about what is happening.In reality, I doubt that many companies will be in a position to throw a lot of money and resources to help them cope. So unfortunately, the only hing I can suggest is to keep persevering. But be prepared to lose money. Hopefully it won't be that much if you've only paid a deposit so far."
"Dear Ron,It is so kind to have someone interested in my problem. No, I have paid the full amount so I have to get my cancellation agreed in next 10 days to get 50 % of my money back otherwise I will lose 75%So frustrating not being able to contact them. I will never do this again. I would always use a High Street Agent. At least I could go into their shop and speak to them."
"We have just returned from an aborted cruise with Silversea. We started in Laem Chabang, Thailand, and ported in Ho Chi Minh as planned. The route was changed subsequently, not that it mattered as we were never allowed to dock at the re-arranged ports. On the way to our next port of call, the first of three ports in the Philippines, we were turned away because the ship had allowed 12 passengers to board who had come through Chine/HongKong in the previous 14 days. We were also refused access to our two ports of call in Taiwan for the same reason. The ship then turned around and headed back to Ho Chi Minh where the cruise was to be brought to an end and we would all fly home. That didn't work either as Vietnam also refused to allow us to port. We finally ended up back in the unattractive cargo port of Laem Chabang for two days until Silversea could get everyone flights home (a process they messed up big time). Our cruise cost will be reimbursed but we don't know what will happen re the flights & pre-cruise hotel costs which were supplied as part of a package by our travel agent. Silversea have offered 25% of the cost of the aborted cruise against another cruise - not exactly generous when we managed just one port out of the seven planned. If we had just wanted to lie by a pool we wouldn't have booked a cruise holiday in the first place - we always go for the itinerary and the orignal routing was very interesting for us. What we got was nothing like what we had booked. It is particularly annoying as the decision to allow the 12 passengers to board after they had come through China was hardly wise - both from a health perspective for the rest of the passengers & crew and as a risk to the future progress of the voyage. Sure a few people would have been unhappy but better that than a ship of nearly 600 people."
Sandra Can you call the cruise line & explain the situationI am sure they have dealt with many people that have booked with Iglu judging by the complaintsAsk for a supervisor or the resolution Dept another option if you can sign into your account with the cruise line maybe there is a cancel button there Send Iglu an email & tell them you wish to cancel as of today then it is also in writing that way
Update on Diamond princesshttps://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5062/
ANDMARCan you file a claim with ABTA ?I read that Brits can get a refund if they do not get the cruise they booked Hopefully no one got sick on the ship
"Hi Sandra, we are currently experiencing extremely high call volumes. I am sorry that you havent been able to reach us. Please can you private message me your booking reference, and I will locate your booking and assist you further. Kind regards,TamsinCustomer CareIglu/Planet CruiseEdited: 10:02 am, February 13, 2020 "
Thank you for your advice. I cannot speak to P and O because I booked through Iglu. They don't want to know. Cannot speak to Iglu because they are not picking up the phone. i am emailing Iglu every day. Just have to keep going. I can get through to their booking line - no problem if I want to book a cruise but they will not deal with existing customers. Will keep you posted and thanks for your attention. Good to know someone is out there.
SANDRA Did you notice post #143 above from Iglu
No I did not see that. We may have a break through. Thank you.
"Hello Tamsin,I am trying to cancel my cruise. Don't know how to private message you."
Thank you very much. Will give it a try.
"Thanks lht, that is helpful. Thankfully no-one was sick on the ship, nor afterwards to the best of my knowledge.Although we have good insurance it isn't clear that they will pay up - they would if we cancelled in certain circumstances but the cruise line cancelled. I'm not sure about ABTA either - there is mention of cruises starting in he UK/EU but not outside although it may be covered by another category. It is just a question of ploughing through. We travelled with SixStar cruises who are very reputable. I have already asked them on next steps so hopefully they will give us a steer."
ANDMARSuch an unusual situation for all pax & cruiselines alike most lines are doing the best they can under the ever evolving circumstances Hopefully SS will come through with a suitable solution for all
I have good news. Iglu has been in touch but not in response to my direct emails to them but in response to Tripadvisor. What would I have done without Tripadvisor.? They have accepted my cancellation but I have lost 50% of the cost of my holiday. Thank you all at Tripadvisor.
SANDRAGood news & bad news but at least you got something back
"ANDMAR Were you on the SS spirit??I see on CC someone mentioned "" they are handing everyone s airline changes and a full refund of the cruise fares.not their fault but they are doing a great job of making it good for us.""Did you not get the refund plus the 25% off a future cruise?"
"No, I get 50% back and they have given me £25 because of my trouble. To be honest, I am so pleased to get out of this. In future I will book last minute because the world is so unstable. Then I will know where I am and I will be in control for longer. Iglu wanted full payment 4 months before departure so I got tied in too early. A big learning curve for me. Hope this helps other travellers. So grateful to have a community to talk to."
"Does anybody know if the cruise canceled by the cruise lines and they said 100% refund, do they refund Taxes and port fee or just the cruise fare?"
"Today I received port fees back from a Crystal cruise I cancelled under an FCC arrangement due to covid-19 forced itinerary changesYou do not mention the cruise line, or the particular cruise, so it is really guess work to answer your question.Edited: 8:03 am, February 14, 2020 "
OZIt should port fees also if you have not taken the cruise yet
Sandra Most lines want full payment 3-4 mths in advance of the sailing date
"SandraI'm pleased you got some money back... payment in full a few months is a requirement of many cruise lines ... not just a travel agent. Once the get the funds, they have too clear it .... some build in an extra week to clear the funds.Re: last minute sailings - generally you will have to pay in full due to the short lead in time before the cruise.Don't forget, travel insurance regardless of whether it covers pandemics or not is definitely worthwhile having ... look for ""Cancel for any reason"" / add it on to the insurance if you can and you should get a lot of it back.Lastly, Travel Agents have a different set of Terms and Conditions and once you enter into a contract with them, you are bound by their terms and conditions as well as the cruise line's terms and conditions which would be different in terms of cancellation fees etc.You can book directly with a cruise line or go to to a travel agent - the choice is yours but understand that even if you got 100% refund from the cruise line, a travel agent can and does charge a cancellation fee to cover their administrative costs etc as per their contract (See the receipt which is the same as a contract for all intents and purposes)."
"@FrommyI booked direct with Princess cruise to asia in April, trying to work out all the cost associated with cancellation. I can still get 75% of Cruise fare back but not port charge and Tax. Try to work out if we are just waiting for Princess to cancel but they might not!!! I have 2 weeks left to decide.Edited: 4:07 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"@Oz138We are booked on Princess from Singapore on 16 April. I will not be cancelling for two reasons. One, if the cruise is on then I am going. Two, if Princess cancel then you get ALL costs back, plus if they cancel late we would probably get a significant additional credit for a future cruise. The cruise they cancelled next week resulted in people getting 50% of their fare in future credit plus the refund.I can do this as I don't have other factors in my way such as leave from work etc. Of course people have other reasons why they need more planning time."
"I read on FB the other day about some people who had just arrived in Singapore for their cruise the day before departure only to learn the cruise was cancelled presumably while they were in transit. Consequently a long flight, a night or two additional so they could organise flights home, then sort out their cruise being cancelled and submit a claim.One thing's for sure ... this is such a fluid situation like we've not seen before (that I recall) and I would say that Princess and other cruise lines are throwing whatever resources they have into this issue as much as they can / as fast as they can / as changes occur.I do know that Princess sent out a bulk email to all passengers to inform them of changes several days ago - we did not receive an email however someone contacted one of the Princess offices and was told a lot of emails bounced - they dont know which ones - potentially thousands - and they were looking into their systems to see why this happened.Another thing has become clear to me ... many people do not look at their cruise line web site ... do not think to teach for ""coronavirus"" in the search box and seem to rely on travel advisory forums etc .. or wait for an email from their TA.By the way, friends are on the Sun Princess out of Perth heading via SE Asia to Cape Town and return. They departed on 24th Jan, first stop Singapore on 30th Jan, Phuket on 1st Feb, Colombo on 4th Feb, Seychelles on 8th Feb, Zanzibar on 11th Feb then denied entry into Madagascar on 13th Feb as it had been 12 days since they left Phuket.As I noted above, things change everyday even if you think you're ""safe"" and not affected by this virus."
"In terms of port charges/taxes refunds, my impression is that cruise lines put these into a separate account bucket (in their own accounts), and so refunds may be processed for these separately. It's not unusual for a port to be skipped even on an otherwise normal cruise because of weather, and port charges are refunded in those cases. Singapore has a significant count of coronavirus cases, with numerous examples of local spread, so many other ports seem to be getting jumpy about accepting ships which boarded in S'pore. I suspect Singapore, by nature of their geographic/political environment, has probably the most accurate picture of their coronavirus spread of anyplace in the world. I expect local port officials, even well away from Asia, are going to be *much* more picky about ship health reports before granting ""Pratique"" (clearance to use the port). Unfortunately, the cruise industry as a whole has a bad reputation (among those who pay attention) for norovirus and respiratory infection spread onboard ships. If a cruise line suddenly shows up asking for permission to dock their ship out of the normal schedule, local port officials will know it's because they got denied elsewhere and that they risk some awkward headlines in the local media.Edited: 7:32 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"Wall St Journal is reporting that US govt is going to evacuate all asymptomatic Americans (actually, I think also only those who WANT to leave) from Diamond Princess and fly them to US (likely Travis AFB in CA) on 2 flights, with possibly both leaving by Sunday. All will have 14 day quarantine in US, either at Travis or Lackland AFB in TX."
"Japan reported 67 new cases from Diamond Princess today (from NHK, equiv to BBC). There's also other spread in Japan, including a taxi driver in Okinawa who drove DP passengers when the ship stopped there.In the *really* bad news department, Malaysia has reported that one of the passengers from HAL Westerdam, who had gotten off in Cambodia and was flying home via Malaysia, has tested positive. Further flights of Westerdam passengers (at least via Malaysia) have been stopped. This was from Straits Times, a pretty sober and reliable news source in Singapore. This leaves most of the Westerdam passengers and crew stuck in a country with very limited medical resources."
"Yes -iht - we were on Silver Spirit. However we used a UK travel agent to book.SS are refunding the cost of the cruise back to the travel agent but it was the travel agent (SixStar) who packaged together the flights, hotels, etc..Legally we have no contract with Silversea, only with SixStar. I have emailed SixStar but so far had no esponse (I suspect they are inundated but some acknowledement would be useful). Silversea were refunding passengers who had booked direct but I have no idea whether than include arirfares & hotels.Silversea attempted to handle the repatriation flights but it was a complete shambles. When we had heard nothing for two full days we contacted our travel agent who then sorted out our flights home. Many other passengers did the same. Communication on the part of SS was shockingly bad - they could have saved themselves a lot of grief by keeping passengers informed better. On our second day in the port in Thailand (this would be 5/6 days after we were told the cruise was being aborted), knowing that everybody had to be off the ship by 4.30pm, there were still passengers who didn't know how they were getting home. Silversea took on the job but simply didn't have the resources to do it. They should have let everyone's travel agent deal with it from the outset. Our travel agent had already made three changes to the flights as the disembarkation point kept changing as we were denied entry. We understand that Silversea will be picking up any costs associated with the flight changes.Silversea told us we would get the 25% future cruise credit (the credit is 25% of what the travel agent paid for our cruise so we don't know exactly how much it would be and have nothing in writing to confirm the offer or the sum). I'm not sure it matters - I doubt we would sail with them in future & 25% isn't IMO generous for a completely ruined holiday. We aren't retirees and can't get back the annual leave we used, most of which was spent bobbing around waiting for a port to let us dock. We are partcularly annoyed as SS apparently denied boarding to Chinese passengers but allowed non-Chinese who had transited through China/HK to join the cruise. Those 12 passengers were the reason we were not allowed to dock in the Philippines or Taiwan. Even before we left Thailand Silversea had changed the disembarkation port so they had fair warning of problems ahead and didn't take the obvious step of denying boarding to the group who came via China which clearly increased the risk of being denied entry to other ports. It was hardly rocket science.There was a contingent onboard who thought SS were doing a great job, mostly SS loyalists - obviously they weren't the ones waiting for SS to sort out their flights or stressing about how they were going to get medication, etc.."
ANDMARThanks for the explanation I guess your travel agents work differently than here we book through the agent but all monies go to the cruise line directly not to the agentso if we were to cancel the $$ are returned to us not the TAToo bad you had such an ordeal It is not a good situation for any of the lines sailing in Asia now nor the pax stuck on ships for days Hope you get some resolution soon
"Princess have announced major changes to their cruises, including the cancellation of mine!https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_ad…"
"lht, I'm not so sure it's that travel agents work differently. I think it's more that the legislative framework for holidays is very different here. The result is that relationships between agents, customers and lines are very different, and that also impacts on things like non refundable deposits."
ROJNot to go too far off topicbut just to understand so if the cruise lines cancel the cruise then the refund goes to the agent but not the pax then if the agent decides whether they want to refund the pax?? seems unfair
GRAEME too bad about the cancellation but in my opinion staying out of Asia for now might be a good thing I am not sure they have figured out how this virus is really transmitted
"Not quite. The money fr any cancellation where it was initially paid to the travel agent by the client is refunded to the travel agent, however, the travel agent must then refund this to the client. Maybe a small fee can be charged but only if that is in a contract at the time of booking, which is highly unlikely."
I think that there would be a lot of difference in the terms and conditions applied between genuine travel agents and the online ticket floggers.
I am booked on a 5 day cruise with Royal Caribbean going on 9th March 2020. Absolutely no idea if it will happen although they have cancelled their February cruises. Very frustrating as no idea really what is happening.
"Cathy - where are you sailing? RCCL is maintaining their updates on cancellations, status, etc via the website It's my understanding they've cancelled and redeployed the few Asian itineraries and ships they had.Cruises elsewhere in the world remain unaffected. The only March 9 RCCL cruise I see is one to the Bahamas - which currently (and for the foreseeable future) are totally unaffected. If I have the wrong sailing, I apologise.Monitor the RCCL website for updates, etc. They're the best source for any specifics."
"AndmarThat's a shame about SS not handling the matter as well as some other lines have been doing.Re ""Legally we have no contract with Silversea, only with SixStar"" ... you would have a contract with Silversea, however the contract you have with the Travel Agent over-rides the terms and conditions in the Silversea Terms and conditions to the extent that a Travel Agent can and often does charge cancellation fees whereas the cruise line may not. If you are buying a berth on a ship or a seat on a plane, you are still bound by the T&C of the carrier ... it's primarily the cancellation charges that you are obliged to pay the Agent."
DOUGOOZ I think SS was giving 100 % refund for the aborted cruise plus 25% off future cruise  Why would the TA be allowed to keep all of the refund ?I can see them keeping some of the refund if they are losing their commission in the deal but I would think that would be in the T & C of Six Star agency ??

LHTYes - you are correct ... sorry I misread the post ... but TA's here certainly can and do keep deposits if you cancel within time of the ship's T&C ... one I contacted in December said they can hang onto the deposit for 2 years because they wanted you to come back and buy another cruise from them !
DOUGOOZI do understand the penalties BEFORE the cruise but ANDMAR was on the ship when SS cancelled the rest of the cruise because the ports closing in fear of the virus I hope his/her TA will send the full refund to them
"lhtAgree ...Edited: 7:01 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"Thanks Doug - that's helpful and having checked our documentation again I can sea that Silversea is the principal as regards the cruise element. I'm still trying to find out what our position is overall - silence from the travel agent although I guess they are probably inundated with changes to itineraries. It isn't just the cruise fare I am concerned about but the flights (we don't fly long haul at the back!). I would like to think that they will be refunded too but I am not sure. The flights were organised by our travel agent, not Silversea. I have seen that Princess are allowing reasonable costs in addition to the cruise fare where they did not arrange flights. Our trip was a waste of time (& annual leave) - we managed only one port out of seven. We don't regard the time spent floating around at sea whilst they tried to find a port that would accept us as part of the holiday. As each port said no and Diamond Princess was quarantined in Yokohama we were worried the same was going to happen to us so pretty stressful. We also spent a lot of time chasing the amended flights home. It would be galling if we were hit for the flight costs in the circumstances.We have only a rough idea what the travel agent paid for the cruise (based on the discount figure on a future cruise which we were given) so it isn't clear what the refund from SS will be and whether the TA will take a portion of it as t would have been their primary profit (air bookings these days make little or nothing for the TA)."
Cruise line Silversea on May 5th out of Venice need to know if we should cancel my husband has an on going lung situation. thank you
Should we cancel with our insurance our trip from Venice cruise ship silversea may 5th he has lung situations
VITO that is something you should discuss with your Doctor You could check with SS to see if you can change or postpone the cruise without penalty Many lines are letting pax postpone cruises until a later date https:/…update-on-coronavirus.html
"We have a cruise booked out of Barcelona on a Spanish ship for next month.
