"Quantas is giving us only 4 days to get a credit from our travel agent travelgenio, and cancel our ticket, The agency doesnt respond so what do we do . we only have till the 30th of april to get a credit. We cant even contact quantasDoes anyone have a solution."
Read the (literally) 100 other threads about TravelGenio.They are a bad company under normal conditions. Now they are pretty much impossible to get in touch with.Not sure why you picked them. Well known and discussed here for many years as a terrible company.
"Your post makes no sense. Qantas only gives you 4 days to get a credit from Travelgenio but you can't get hold of Qantas? Why would you want to when you should be contacting Travelgenio? I hope you share more relevant information with them than you have with this forumEdited: 8:23 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Unfortunately your only option is to contact Travelgenio, which, when you read the 1000s of complains here, is almost impossible to do. You will have to keep trying. Good luck"
