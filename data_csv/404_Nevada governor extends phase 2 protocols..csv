"Gov. Steve Sisolak said Nevada will remain under Phase 2 reopening guidelines, as current coronavirus data trends need to be examined to better understand the impact of the reopening.At a news conference on June 15th, Sisolak said there is no current set timeline for further expansion of business reopenings or lifting of restrictions.In Phase 2, gatherings increased from 10 people to 50, with social distancing standards.Businesses remaining closed during the second phase include adult entertainment establishments, nightclubs and day clubs.https:/…"
"Our incompetent Governor did not even have the respect to wear a tie while sitting next to the American Flag. No mention of the thousands going on 13 weeks on not receiving unemployment, or the thousands that will NOT be called back to work by the Casino industry. Just a publicity stunt to pacify the public. He really did not give any insight as to the future plans of the state. He has destroyed Las Vegas & Nevada and continues to do so."
“ Our incompetent Governor did not even have the respect to wear a tie while sitting next to the American Flag.”I thought I was up on my flag etiquette. Is this a thing?
It seems like he’d rather still be in shut down mode.
"“ It seems like he’d rather still be in shut down mode.“Why? What does he gain from that? Other than the displeasure of some portion of his constituents? I mean, seriously. What’s in it for him?"
“ did not even have the respect to wear a tie”That’s an odd response. How did you feel about trump humping the flag?
"As the Governor of this state, he should dress appropriately for a press conference, which includes a tie."
"Tie or no tie, who cares!"
"Polo shirts and windbreakers are the uniform du jour for most politicians these days when they’re doing briefings. Some class it up a bit with a blazer.The days of a suit and tie are long gone. ( There’s a reason why Nordstrom, Macy’s and even ( shudder) Mens Wearhouse are all flirting with bankruptcy. )Edited: 10:34 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"""As the Governor of this state, he should dress appropriately for a press conference, which includes a tie.""Actually I was expecting a cowboy hat. All the movies set in Vegas always show the government officials wearing cowboy hats!"
"But, if you look at the back of the windbreaker, it says “The Gov.”Hunt"
“Trump humping the flag”Where did you see that..... pornhub?
"""Our incompetent Governor did not even have the respect to wear a tie while sitting next to the American Flag.""I would suggest there are bigger issues to worry about"
"No tie, saggy jacket and slumped posture: he looked like he was sitting at a bar, waiting for his next beer. I didn't listen, and he may have had a better verbal than physical presentation..."
"politicians aren't peoplethey're physical embodiments of MERICA f yeah, anything to feel superior in any way MERICA f yeah"
"Governor Sisolak has avoided mention of the Nevada COVID-19 infection rate, which has progressively declined to now being 5.2%. Reading between the lines of what he said, I think he's concerned about health effects from protest gatherings and lack of social distancing in the casinos.I think he's playing this right, giving it another 2-3 weeks and check the data thereafter. The time for COVID-19 to become significant from first infection, is generally around 2-3 weeks. I'd think around 2 weeks from this past weekend would be a good time to re-examine the COVID-19 health data.Edited: 2:36 am, June 16, 2020 "
"I don't really care, do you?"
"“ I don't really care, do you?”About...?The governor’s wardrobe? The infection rate? The extension of Phase 2 ? Flag etiquette?"
"I agree. A cowboy hat should have been required. And Hunt, blazing saddles rides again. Thanks for the laugh."
"I do agree that it's to pacify the public. I think taking any precautions was just to pacify the public. The governor has been seen around town not following precaution several times. Plus, Im sure government officials, of all ppl, are well aware of how the ""facts"" of the virus changed drastically from week to week due to the rantings of the media. They, of all ppl, know what's really happening. But they have to seem like they care. I get it."
"One of the guys speaking took his mask off when it was his turn, then put it on again. If he had COVID, he just infected everything he now touches. This is the level of stupidity from government. And there is no excuse for the Governor to look rumpled. This isn't some major natural disaster or terrorist attack. If the houskeeper at Wynn can put on a crisp uniform in the morning so that guests she interacts with feel comfortable and well taken care so, so should the Governor who makes a lot more money, should have a lot better clothing, and is the face of the state. I don't have a problem with no tie, I have a problem with him looking like a schmuck."
Politically obvious move.
Haha. You can tell his decision was the only reasonable one to be made when his critics are forced to resort to complaining about his appearance.
"Sisolak made the right call on this one but is still horrible. It looks like he has a lot of fans that do not live in Nevada. You all should move here, he may be the best Governor ever."
Insee No for Gov!
"In_Seeno, I'll admit to not knowing much about him except that I admire the prudence he has shown in re-opening in the face of what must have been unbelievable pressure to join the horde and abandon any and all guidelines in a rush to re-open. There's a chance he might face some REALLY difficult choices a few months down the road and the fact that he uses empirical data and not ideology to guide him bodes well for the health of millions of people.Edited: 1:35 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"Although the handling of covid 19 is a hot topic there are many other issues in our State. I think our Governor has been horrible at handling many of them. As stated above, I agree with his current assessment regarding our Phase 2 but he is not off the hook. I know Trump says Fauci is awesome and I bet many folks agree with that even though they hate Trump. I can not wait to vote against this guy. I have noticed all but 1 local on this forum have been anti Sisolak, I could be off on my numbers but that is what I have noticed. I doubt he is only being graded on Covid 19."
"Trump saying Fauci is awesome is political. If there was a way to boot the guy without getting damaged himself, Trump would do it."
"PnS, You may be correct but my point is really that you can agree with something a guy you loathe says and still want him out."
"Kind of reminds me of how many voters, left and right, regard Cuomo here in NY. I myself am not a fan at all, but I grudgingly admit he has done quite well in dealing with Covid.I particularly like how he lost his sh*t this week over how many places that have started to re-open ignored any and all restrictions. Several of my neighbors in fact. Gives me faith we'll do it right."
"I agree with your point Inseeno but re Trump and Fauci, I have a feeling Trump doesn't agree with much he says. Somethings yes, especially in the begining. Probably close to nothing now. Party doesn't make things right. I'd take Sen. Manchin over Gov. Justice to run West Virginia. I'd take Tulsi Gabbard over any Bush to run America. Even if I disagree on many issues, competence and honesty matter."
