"Hello,My wife and I recently booked flights to Fiji with TravelGenio, only to find they had taken our money but not issued our tickets and therefore the airline had cancelled our booking. Cancelling our trip would have incurred additional costs such as hotel charges which were non refundable so we were forced to buy two new tickets at the airport at an extertionate price.We are now attempting to obtain a refund from TravelGenio for the new flights purchased due to a mistake (or scam?) on their part and are being told this is not their fault and they can’t do anything. We’ve sent numerous emails and made many calls but are unfortunately getting the same answer. Has anyone else had a similar experience with TravelGenio? And if so any thoughts on how to progress with this? The generic response from their customer services team on all the social media posts asking us to get in touch with their team will not help as we’ve already tried that."
Hi. What a shame you used the dreadful company Travelgenio before finding this forum and doing just a little bit of research. There are hundreds and hundreds of posts on here warning not to use them! If you are lucky (?) they have a rep who posts on here and they might see this post and offer to help you. The reply will be a generic one posted by a bot but hey ho! Good luck. You're going to need it.
“and are being told this is not their fault and they can’t do anything”—> What reason was given to you?I suspect you will be faced with a futile battle trying to get Travelgenio to pay you the high walk-up ticket costs.“The generic response from their customer services team on all the social media posts asking us to get in touch with their team will not help as we’ve already tried that.”—> The only other thing I can think of is trying to get one of the newspapers travel writers involved. Not sure where you are based but in the U.K. for example the Telegraph have a good travel problems section and the columnist seems to often get results when she intervenes with travel businesses.
Have you made a claim from your CC company? Hopefully you paid by CC.
"Saying that they do not respond when you try and get in touch with them (after they post saying they will help), just confirms what we all thought anyway....they only post to try and make themselves look better!!!"
"I don’t think there is an opportunity for a cc claim smudge99. I read it that the OP is wanting his money for the higher ticket fares which he had to purchase from the airline at the airport. This was a valid transaction between him and the airline. I suspect the original transaction with Travelgenio never went through, therefore no cc charge back there either."
"Hello Anand, tell us your booking number to verify the case and we will contact you by email.Best regards."
"As I read it TU, they did take his money, but failed to make a booking with the airline. We can argue that the OP should have checked the airline website frequently before travelling to confirm that all was in order, but nevertheless, he has paid for tickets which he did not receive. In addition, he had to pay walk-up price for the tickets which he bought at the airport. I'm not clear if he originally bought a holiday package, flights and hotel from TravelGenio but either way, they have taken money for a service which he didn't receive."
Possibly - perhaps the OP can confirm.We often see cases when the funds have been ring-fenced on the credit card but the transaction never completes. No ticket therefore issued but the passenger thinks payment has been made as the available balance drops on their card. Some days later the hold drops off.
"Hi,Booking ref: 2FQMZK.We have received the same generic response from your customer services team since 4th October over emails and numerous calls not answering any of our questions regarding the refund so we are hoping you can review all our emails and provide a fair resolution. Thanks"
"Will people ever learn not to book with such awful companies ?I can honestly that ever since booking flights on the internet has been feasible and practical, I've never had a demand for more cash, a flight "" cancelled/never booked"" etc.Why on earth do people kept doing it, book your own flights for gawds sake, it's embarrassingly easy."
"Nor me but then I book directly with the airline and as you say Rick, it is SO easy!"

"In my view it's much easier to do as is advised here many times a day and book directly with the airline than to have to go to court when things go wrong. Obviously, those that have already become victims will be angry and want to get back at Travelgenio, but for anyone else, just don;t go searching for cheap deals through useless sites like this one!In this case, I think the best course of action for you, Anand, is to contact your card provider and see if they can assist."
Thanks. Essentially they simply dodge the question even when ask directly either In email or on the phone. Essentially they listen but offer no help or opinion. we are based in Australia but perhaps that is an avenue we can pursue.
@uk traveller. Essentially Travelgenio took our money and did not book an outgoing flight and did not inform us of this. Then refunded the money after we told them of their error which we discovered at the airport and thus incurred the very high cost of last minute tickets
@neapolitino and travel undercover That is correct and no travel package. thank you. Agree i should of checked prior I suppose years of travel using such websites without issue have made me complacent. Lesson learned. But as you said the issue is taking money for services not rendered and not informing us of this which resulted in the choice between paying high last minute plane tickets or cancelling a holiday including already paid for hotel.
Let’s see what the Travelgenio bot can do to resolve or at least update the thread now the OP has provided their booking number (post #9).
"Anand, you have at least had your refund, so TravelGenio have complied with their T&C. If you only booked the flight through them, they can't be held responsible for your consequential losses as they would have had no way of knowing how the flight related to your other plans. If you have used websites like this for many years without problems, you have been extraordinarily lucky as a brief read through this forum would have told you. Even booking directly with the airline, I always check to make sure the credit card transaction has gone through and that the flight details are correct etc. Two or three weeks beforehand I always check again to make sure the online check in will go smoothly. I've always had updates from the airline for schedule changes, notification of gate numbers and other flight details by text or e-mail or both, but it always pays to be certain."
@Neapolitano. Sound advice. Just to clarify the refund only occurred after the scheduled outgoing flight had departed. Travelgenio did book the return flight however. We were not requesting any compensation for other bookings but just illistratrating that it would not have been trivial to cancel our holiday for financial as well as personal reasons. My quarrel is with the failure to book a flight that I paid for and not informing me of said failure. Thus placing me in a position to need last minute tickets. I agree going forward I will check directly with the airline. However that aside I personally feel that i did not receive the service I was due. Equally I understand mistakes can be made. In this case I would be satisfied if travelgenio refund me for costs I incurred as a costumer due to their error (difference in cost of outgoing flights). With this level of compensation I would be no better off than if things had gone smoothly and am not seeking any compensation for time wasted or distress caused. If this is not the outcome I think it is appropriate to inform others so that they do not make the same mistake as myself and understand that travelgenio May take their money and not book flights they agreed to and not take it upon themselves to inform you of that fact before your flight. It would then be up to the individual to decide wether they thought that was fair behaviour. Thanks again for your interest in this issue and your help.
Avoid this company. The website takes your money before you press the final payment button. Then takes hours to tell you it has done so. Theft in my opinion.
Smart K - is this the same booking from August last year or did you book with them again?
"Hi Smart K, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
HiI have recently booked 3 tickets to London with them. They just mailed e tickets and have not given pnr number. Also the booking status shows OPEN. I smell something fishy here and am following up with the airline. Let's see what they have to say.
"Hi Sayhlee, we can help you with your online check in if needed. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you all the steps to succeed with the check in online in the airline web. Regards"
"I haven´t travelled with them and they already scammed me. The price says one thing and I´ve got charged a different one. If it was a small difference I could have pass that (although I should not) but it's 50 extra dollars for no reason. I even have screen captures of the case and they failed to give a real answer on the email that I sent them. They answered to me in english and in spanish like if I sent different enquieres but I just sent one...seriously, so confusing and annoying...Flying used to be a pleasant and exciting experience. Now it's so hard to navigate on internet with so many scammers..."
"Hi Gonzalo, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Gonzalo. It really is VERY simple.Book directly with the AIRLINE!Travelgenio use a bot to send replies,. Give or take a few words, they are all exactly the same. They do not read the posts. Do not expect any help from them .Edited: 1 year ago "
"Traveller is 100% right. There is no need to navigate the internet trying to avoid rubbish companies like Travelgenio. Simply go directly to an airline's own website where the prices are live and you won't have to play any silly games.It's not that airlines are perfect, because they aren't, but they are much better, more transparent and have far superior customer service than anything you'll get from any third party booking site."
There was a typo on my ticket and they said they had fixed it but it turns out they had not. Ended up having an issue at customs and it resulted in me having the buy the ticket twice... will never use again
Customs does not care about the names on tickets. Maybe you had a problem with Security.
"Hi David, could you please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com to check all the booking procedure with the name change petition? We will get in touch with you asap. Regards"
Can you please help me too? One of the flights i bought with ypu was cancelled and neither on the call centre or the online client services I receive an answer. The airline says you're the only ones that can change or reissue that ticket.
"Sure Juanita_Erasso, please send us a mail with all the info to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will help you and inform you. Regards"
"The airline is correct. Unfortunately you are Travelgenio's customer, not theirs. Good luck."
"Alex, you only need to post once. By spamming the forums you risk all your posts being deleted."
"Hi Alex, send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the booking details and we will check what happened with the confirmations or tickets and inform you. Regards"
"I have made a booking earlier today around 6 hours back. My tickets still haven't been issued. I called them. A girl picked up, took all my details and put me on hold only to cut the call. I called again. No one answered for 10 minutes. On my third try currently. THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER."
"Hi North Star823698, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Hi, this is your reply to everyones concerns. Highly doubt you are committed to actually solving our problems.I have already raised a ticket #2391687 and sent an email from ""akshitadd@hotmail.com""."

More Travelgenio incompetence - did they really just post the personal details of someone's booking on a worldwide public forum?-JimG
More Travelgenio incompetence - did they really just post the personal details of someone's booking on a worldwide public forum?=========Looks like it.
"Great. And as @NorthStar823698 was clever enough to also post his email, it just takes two clicks to access his booking on TravelGenio, seeing his phone number, address in Singapore, the price etc.Also, the booking: Thai Lion Mentari-SL101 / Singapore Airlines-SQ981"
Travelgenio. BIG mistake...huge!!! Just how incompetent can you get? You need to take down post #41 right now!Edited: 1 year ago 
"It was also rather crazy of NorthStar to publicly post his email address like that too. NorthStar, you only made the booking request 6 hours ago. It can take much much longer to actually get the booking.Sometimes these threads are like watching train wrecks."
"Just when I think things can't get any worse with Travelgenio, that's exactly what happens! Maybe NorthStar and them are well suited to each other."

I think Tripadvisor are as dismal as Travelgenio at this moment in time.
It seems that TA staff have no idea what they are doing! What a surprise!
"Maybe, as we suspect with Travelgenio, the humans have all been replaced by bots :-)"
"THIS WEBSITE IS A SCAM. DO NOT USE. I’ve been an avid traveler for year, flying worldwide & I’m so upset I made the mistake of booking through this website before reading reviews. THEY SCAMMED ME SO HARD. I bought 2 direct tickets to Mexico which should have been a 4hr flight. They sent me a confirmation email with tickets that had a layover and took 12hrs!!! A FOUR flight that is now going to take me TWELVE hours. The return flight is even longer FOURTEEN HOURS! With a layover!!!! I contacted them about this & they said they wouldn’t do anything about it because I didn’t notice the discrepancy within 24hrs!!! ABSURD, I have never dealt with something so awful in the service industry. When trying to contact them email staff took days at a time to respond & were rude & over the phone I kept being hung up on. DO NOT USE, SAVE YOURSELF AND ENJOY YOUR TRAVEL EXPERIENCE INSTEAD. I will make sure everyone knows to avoid this company at all costs!!!!!!!"
">>I will make sure everyone knows to avoid this company at all costs!!!!!!!<<No, you will not because there will always be people like you who throw their money at a cheap price without doing research."
"'THEY SCAMMED ME SO HARD.' Did they? 'I bought 2 direct tickets to Mexico which should have been a 4hr flight. They sent me a confirmation email with tickets that had a layover and took 12hrs!!!' Unless you booked with your eyes closed whilst sitting in a dark room, you accepted their offer of flights with a connection. Did you look at the details of what they offered to book for you or just look at the cost, nod and say great, I'll have that.'I’ve been an avid traveler for year, flying worldwide & I’m so upset I made the mistake of booking through this website' Painful question (likely with a painful answer if the author ever returns) but why did you book with this nauseating operation?"
"They must have shown you the route and you continued with the purchase. Were you simply not paying attention? If so, how is that Travelgenio’s fault? Where is the scam? If you didn’t like the route offered, you should have not clicked “buy now.” There’s no need to add another warning about Travelgenio. There are already literally thousands of warnings all over TA and the web. The word is out there for all to read. Book directly with the airline next time. No need to use a shoddy middleman."
"You weren't scammed, marthamid. You were caught out, and you contributed to that sad situation yourself. Firstly by not checking out Travelgenio first, and secondly by not checking the confirmation you received from them carefully enough.No doubt you were after something cheap, and that's what you got. Speed normally costs a lot more than flights with connections and long layovers.Edited: 1 year ago "
"TP, I love your use of nauseating to describe this company :-)"
"Hi Martha,Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.co with all your doubts and we will answer you asap with the details of the booking made. Regards"
Beware!!! There are additional fees after first payment!I've bought a ticket later on I've rceived a demand for additinal fees with no invoice or explanation .There is a large amount fine for cancellation!!!
"Rafi - were the ""additional fees"" the difference between the 'advertised price' and the 'real price'? When you were told you need to pay an extra $x to get a ticket, you should decline, wait for the hold to drop off your card and then book the real fare direct with the airline."
"Rafi, Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"And the bot has managed to rack up over 3,000 ""offers of help"" posts!!! Congratulations!"
You answered to another customer with s problem we need help please
Unfortunately I didn’t know they were awful

We booked tickets from goa to Dubai with travelerGeno. We have just turned up at goa airport to be told that our flight was booked ove 3 weeks ago and our agent should have told us. When we heard that jet airways were in trouble we did try to phone and sent emails to travelgeno to check about our flights but could not get through/ our emails were ignored. Now we are having to buy new tickets on the day which are very expensive.

"Even if I book directly through the airline, I keep an eye on my bookings. Timings can change, flights can get cancelled.If I would be booked on an airline, which is in danger of going out of business, I would even check more frequently.And finally, if I would have booked through a shonky third party (which I never do), I would certainly check even more frequently.Sadly, you have learned wo lessons:1.) There is no air fare fairy and booking via a third party has some major downsides / risks.2.) Keep an eye on your booking.The following might be too late as you are already in the air. Still.Happily, tickets from Goa to Dubai are not that expensive. I would take a direct flight from Goa to Dubai.Please have a look at which airport you will arrive and leave Dubai. Many flights are moved out of DXB to DWC during the runway upgrade of DXB. There should be a free shuttle bus between DXB and DWC. But it will take time to change airports. If you connect in Dubai on separate tickets and have to change airports, make sure you have 6 or more hours between the two flights. The two airports are in roughly 40 km distance from each other. And rush hour can be unpleasant also in Dubai."
"Forgot to mention, you will certainly receive also an answer from the friendly Travelgenio bot here.The text will start with: ""Hi gerryblack2017, of course we can help ...."""
"I have the same experience. I booked my flight with Travelgenio on 21 Oct 2018 with confirmation #Z60H3Q sent to me on the same date.On 2 Feb 2019, they sent me email telling me there is an involuntary change of itinerary by airline. I have since sent emails expressing my disagreement to the involuntary change.I further have a chain of email communications with their Customer Service with Ticket #2382043. To make the long story short, their Customer Service has agreed to make a full refund to me for the flight cancellation if the replacement flight suggested by them is not accepted or cannot be confirmed by airline. Here is the extract of email from their Customer Service dated 4 Apr : "" Please note that this modification is made unilaterally by the airline, so if the new itinerary was considerably different to the original, the company could authorize the full refund of your tickets."".I called their Customer Service yesterday and was surprised to be advised that there will be no refund to me for flight cancellation due to the involuntary change of itinerary by the airline ! This is really ridiculous and unacceptable as what they have promised in black & white is ignored. It is a shame that they don't keep their promise.They are still dragging the case claiming that their suggested replacement is still pending airline's confirmation. I wonder how long will this take as this has been dragged for one month !Are their any people out there have the same bad experience? Can share your experience and outcome? Thanks"
"Hi John, You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration."
"I haven't had any bad experiences, John, because I have never gone anywhere near this useless bunch. But i wonder if you'd care to share whether you did, in fact, receive the promised email from them, and also whether if you were contacted your issue has been resolved now."

My mom also faced the same issue. They lack transparency and I'd advice everyone to use another 3rd party site or just go directly to the airline. Travelgenio charge me more despite paying more to get the flexible ticket arrangement. They charged me 300 EUR. The customer service is also slow and multiple different personal respond to you. All in all a terrible experience and highly recommended NEVER to use

I have had the exact same problem. I booked a flight London on 13 July 21019. I received an email confirming my booking yet no e-tickets were received.

I will open a fraudulent case with my bank if I do not receive any assistance from your team. I will also publish your scam of a service across all social media platforms. This is so ridiculous!
Starting a social media campaign will likely not achieve anything more than making you feel a little bit better. Opening a case with your bank or card provider will be a better use of your time and energy.
"Hi TravelGenio,I'm hoping you can help me??I booked two separate tickets on June 14th, from Melbourne to Shanghai and from Shanghai to Paris on August 1st at 11.00am, China, Eastern Flight 738. This ticket included a return flight Melbourne from Paris, Via Shanghai. Reference: S44W2EI also booked a one-way ticket to Paris for my business partner, Dominic Studer, leaving on the same flight (China Eastern Flight 738) from Melbourne to Shanghai and from Shanghai to Paris on August 1st at 11.00am. I don't have a receipt or any record of this flight. Can you please send me an updated booking confirmation for this ticket? We should have a record of the One-Way ticket that was also booked on June 14th, but we do not. Can you please reply with an update for this booking? I have attached a screenshot of both bookings made via my AMEX Credit Card on June 14th. I look forward to your response. Many thanks,Sam"
Hi Sam H. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
We just faced the same issue. It seems that the replies are generated by computers as they are completely ignoring the content of our emails and just saying the same message again.
Many of us here are convinced that the replies are automated.
Of course the replies are computer generated!You don't think they would waste actual man-power on this site?It's just to make them look good and it actually does the complete opposite! A lot of the replies don't even make sense as the wording is so bad.
"Hi Deepak, please indicate your reservation number and we will contact you in the next hours. Best regards."
"They haven't even invested much money into the bots, given the stupid replies. I think they might have bought a system off Derek Trotter in Peckham"
Lesson learned I'm stuck as I write this wanting to change my flight dates and I'm required to pay more than what I payed for my original flight ticket ... what a scam?
How is that a scam?You booked flights on one day and now want to change them to travel on another day. That would incur administrative change fees and possibly a higher airline fare on the new travel date. It is also quite possible that you have to purchase a completely new ticket as the Travelgenio ticket was likely restrictive in terms of changes and refunds - as cheap tickets often are.
"Not a user of third parties but I cannot see any scam. You asked them to purchase a ticket with certain rules and they provided that.high change fees on cheap restricted tickets is.not unusual. The majority of the fees will be as per the airline fare rules (change fee plus fare difference?) and you will have a TravelGenio fee of €50 on topBased on the fare rules when you bought the ticket and the t&cs, what were you expecting the charges to be? did you also compare the cost of abandoning that ticket and buying a new one."
"Hi noludwetekile, please send us all the changes you want to make to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the ticket and airline conditions and if they are allowed according to the terms and conditions accepted. Regards"
"Even when you book cheap fares direct it can be cheaper to throw away the ticket and buy a new one if you need to make changes. There is no scam here just sounds like you didn’t understand the fare conditions #108.If you want the flexibility to change dates at no or low cost, you don’t use middlemen who naturally charge for additional work and you buy far more expensive flexible fares directly from the airline. Alternatively don’t book at all until your plans are definite."
"108, there is no scam here. It's just a combination of charges by the airline, including any fare difference, and charges from the third party because they, unsurprisingly, won;t work for free.Keep the flights as they are and not pay any more money, or accept that changing flights has a cost, and that cost is going to be higher if you choose to involve a third party like the admittedly rubbish Travelgenio"
"I have also been hit by a scam on your site, I booked airline ticket, had not been issued a ticket and also incorrect dates of travel on the confirmation receipt. I have tried so so many times to contact your company but no responseSo angry with your company"
"Hi Vanessa786, Welcome to the TripAdvisor Air Travel Forum. Unfortunately this isn't Travelgenio, but if you're lucky the Travelgenio bot will reply and say something like ""Of course we can help with your booking.."" with information on how they can supposedly help you.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Yes, The Travelgenio computer bot will likely reply soon but last time they did they asked someone to forward their “petitions” and of course they could help."
"Hi Vanessa, we will be pleased to assist you with the date change through customer.service@travelgenio.com. Tickets are issued as confirmed as it is an authomatic procedure. Regards"
"Yes i had the same experience, i had to book a flight on short notice, travel genio failed to issue tickets and the airline canceled my flights overnight, I only found out upon traveling to the airport for my early morning flight. They are an awful company, do not ever book through them"
"Hi Storm, next time consider booking directly with the airline, especially if it something on short notice."
"Hi Storm, please send us all the details to check them to customer.service@travelgenio.com. We will contact you by mail asap. Regards"
"Indeed, we had the same experience with this TRAVELGENIO SCAM COMPANY Last Sunday 11 August, we arrived in Abu Dhabi from Kuala Lumpur on our way to our hometown Amsterdam. Our 4 tickets had been messed up by them en we could not get our tckets confirmed. They told us that it was our fault. Unbelievable! We just had to by new tickets was their solution.Just by the perseverance by the friendly Etihad personnel we could embark on a KLM airplane to take us to the Netherlands. We just filed a complaint with a cost refund.When is this going to stop? Is there no supervisory European institution that can take this company of the market?."
"When is it going to Stop?Simple when consumers start taking responsibility for whom they trust their travel plans and money to. Some basic research, thentype that let you find this thread full,of complaints. Except look before you chose some random company on the Internet because they appear cheap. Or just book directly with Etihad or KLM, theynare bith good Airlines with reasonable service - was there a reason you chose a well known shoddy company instead of them?"
"Hi _j_oostlander, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all info and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Just scammed me aswell cancelled my booking on me the day before I fly absolute morons
"Are you certain they had ever made a booking for you to begin with? You don't book in real time with these people. you ""request them to make a booking for you"" and they confirm that they've received your request. Then eventually your request gets to the top of the pile and one of their staff tries to book it for you with the airline. Often they find that the price you selected is unavailable, or that cabin class is full, or the flight has been rescheduled - not real time, remember. Then if you're lucky they tell you they haven't been able to make a booking for you, often with some made up reason like payment errors and ask you for more money as ""the price has gone up in the meantime"", if you're unlucky they don't tell you, and unless you actually read what they sent you in the first place, you go blithely on thinking you've a booking.Now there's a very easy way to avoid this - and there are lots of other online ticket sellers who work just the same way as Travelgenio. That's booking directly withe the airline. The price may sometimes look more expensive than the online ticket floggers made up one, but it's the real price, you can book it and get confirmed tickets instantly, and see exactly what is included in the price, and what you might need to pay extra for (and how much) before you book.."
"Hi carl j, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com in order to check your booking and why it was cancelled. sometimes airlines change their flight plans and, when it happens, we provide the alternatives they give us to solve it. Regards"
Posting multiple times will only end up having all your posts removed..
Noted.. I am sorry but the experience was really bad and this week it happened and till now not solved that is why i am posting in many posts
"there are already 1,000s of warnings....you didn't see them and booked...unlikely yours will make any difference...those that are happy to click without any research will still click without any research until they have a bad experience"
"I have almost received my full refund for tickets cancelled by Turkish airlines ....it has taken 5 months and I hope the second part of the refund will hit my account in 2 weeks.Travelgenio are total scammers..don't answer emails, don't give accurate information over the phone and constantly blame the airline. Why Skyscanner continue to allow them on their service is a mystery.With Travelgenio you must keep plugging away because their business model is delay delay delay until the punters give up."
"“Why Skyscanner continue to allow them on their service is a mystery.”Hardly a mystery. It’s quite simple actually. Travelgenio pays to be on Skyscanner, just like everyone else on Skyscanner pays to be shown on the site. It’s big business and plenty of shonky companies are all over the web ready to pay sites like Skyscanner, Kayak, etc to be on their sites. It’s up to the customer to see who they’re handing their money over to. Book direct as has always been the suggestion on this forum."
"Hi David, refunds depend on airline authorisation and procedure. If you need any further details regarding yours and the time it will take or the current status of it, do not hesitate in contacting us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
Do not book with travelgenio!! I've travelled 5 to 6 six a year for the past four years and I've never come across such a disgusting lying company. When my booking was confirmed I received an email from travelgenio stating:CancellationsAdultsCancellations allowed until 20/07/2019: 100.00% of the fare's value per passenger. Cancellations allowed from 20/07/2019: 100.00% of the fare's value per passenger.Anyway my flight cost £227.95 and after calling consistently for 1 month my emails being ignored and my number was eventually blocked I received a £60 refund in travelgenios words 'as a gesture of commercial goodwill'. The staff are rude again I received generic responses they always told me that they would call me back tomorrow or next week never ever did. I'd rather pay double the fare than have to deal with agent again.
"Don't worry, you'll have a reply from the Travelgenio bot soon. No human actually reads the posts so don't expect any help!"
"Hi Danielle, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Can you help me please? I booked a flight from Nairobi to Lamu last week but when I arrived at Nairobi airport I found that I did not have a seat reserved. The same was for the return flight and I had to book both flights again, costing me hugely. I would like a refund for these flights and the extra costs incurred to me please !"
"Have you tried speaking with your credit card provider? They should help you if you’ve bought tickets, and TravelGenio didn’t book your tickets for you."
"Alex - after you made your booking request, did you receive both a confirmation of your request plus a confirmation of booked flights?How far in advance before the flight did you make your request? (third parties don't have stocks of tickets so can take up to 48 hours to see if they can issue a ticket at the advertised price or not)Did you check your booking on the airline website and try to check in online?Sounds like you made a booking request and they could not issue it at the non-live price...you should get a refund through your card company for the TravelGenio hold. You will likely need to accept the extra is the cost of doing no research and choosing a poor third party to deal with"
I received a confirmation of request but no booked tickets. This was about 3 months in advance but i never received a refund for the cost I paid to TravelGenio.
"Hi Alex E, please ssend us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check what happened with the booking and inform you. Regards"
"Alex, in that three months between the booking request and the flight, did you never independently confirm with the airline that the tickets were booked? What happened 24 hours beforehand at online check in? It’s vital to monitor a booking regardless of whether you used a third party or booked directly with the airline."
"If you only received a confirmation that they were working on your request, then I suspect that it was never fulfilled. Maybe a message from this mob ended up in a spam folder or was sent to the wrong address. Whatever happened, you should have been more pro active to find out whether you actually had a flight booked or not."
"I just booked three tickets to Cyprus from Malta . Money has been taken immediately but no tickets processed. ?? Hope I have not been scammed,."
"Hi Michael, please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
">> I just booked three tickets to Cyprus from Malta <<If you have just submitted the booking request, it may be 24 hours+ before they see if they can get you a ticket at the advertised price. Having a hold placed on funds is normal. You will either get a confirmed booking, asked for more money or the hold may drop and the funds returned.Immediate confirmation with live prices can be found on the airline website (you should be able to tell from the airline website whether the advertised price by TravelGenio was real or not)"
"Dear Friends,i have also same experience with ""TRAVELGENIO Travel agency"". unfortunately i didn't see this forum.i booked  a ticket pay from my credit card but on that time there is no enough money with that but they deduct 22.69GBP two times without my permission.then next day i able to pay from my card that total amount of money which is 702.01GBP . then they deduct that money from the card and send me a mail now ticket price is increased so you have to pay extra 105 GBP.then i send the mail please cancel my booking and refund money back. but until now no any reply the mail and didn't refunded yet. i call them by phone +34911160765 no one answer.Travelgenio is real scam"
"I think that getting a confirmed booking at the price you saw will be the least likely outcome, sorry Michael, but you never know.Travelgenio are utter rubbish, but they are not scammers so you will not lose your money."
"Yes total scammers, got all these extra fees days later"
"If the fees are mentioned somewhere, but you didn't see them, then it's not a scam. If they are not mentioned anywhere at all then it's probably illegal in many parts of the world."
"Hi Robin, please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the charges for it. Regards"
I'm wondering why buy ticket with TravelGenio is much cheaper compare buy direct to the airline.I just make the reservation to Paris from Kuala Lumpur. The price is amazing. Before proceed with paymentI feel uneasy...then I google about travelgenio. The result showing like is dangerous if I continue my booking 'with them. Any advise? TQ
">> I just make the reservation <<you have made a ""booking request"" asking Travelgenio if they can possibly purchase you a ticket at their advertised price (which is not a live price like on the airline website)You should be contacted in the next 24-72 hours (when they work through the requests) to either confirm they have been able to issue a ticket at that price or (more than likely) tell you the price is not available and you need to pay x more"
Hi Meriam of course we can help you before make your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards
I doubt you'll get the price you saw. I expect that Travelgenio will either ask you for money or pretend that something has gone wrong with your payment so that - miraculously - the price will go up if or when you try again.Time will tell.
I was on the process of purchasing a ticket with them now do u reckon that i will lose my money?Please someone advice.
You will need to follow up relentlessly with them via email and telephone. Best of luck.
Look for an alternative...seriously.
"Hi kobamelo Mashaba if you need us to check your booking status, do not hesitate in contacting us through customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the details and we will get in touch with you asap. Regards"
Is this an automated response ?
All of travelgenio's responses are automated.
"kobamelo, please run away from Travelgenio as fast as you can. There are also lots of other sites that are best avoided."
"I tried booking tickets from this site. I was quoted a price which included a discount. When I entered my credit card details, the discount promptly disappeared. I did not hit the proceed button. Scam or algorithm error or my mistake? - dunno."
"Hi Scenic821755, of course we can help you with the payment and price doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Story short: scammers and cheaters.Longer true story: First I was happy; they had a very good price for my ticket. Then I became angry when at the end, after filling the data, I clicked CC type and was supposed to pay extra 50$ than before clicking! I turned the page off. After ~1hr I received an email with a discount code so I decided to check what they have for me, just for fun. And... I LOLed at the end. The price shown to me was cheaper than before for ~10$, I think ""great"". But and the end, again after I clicked my CC's type, my special discount (~50$) was removed and I would need to pay even more than before, ~10$ again but the other way around!Edited: 8:39 pm, October 25, 2019 "
"Hi Krzysztof M, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
Definitely an automated response from Travlegenio
"Yes, I recently cancelled my flight. The airlines has confirmed the cancellation but travelgenia refuses to pay me a refund"
>> but travelgenia refuses to pay me a refund <<what were the fare rules of the ticket? are you sure it was not a non-refundable fare?
"Hi Teresalynn, refunds depend on ticket allowances and airline authorisation. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com or tell us your booking code to check why it was refused and inform you. Regards"
"The Bot at Travelgenio who posts here was obviously programmed to sprinkle glitter on a turd..... badly....Needs a factory re-set, and then trading in for a newer model.... RadioShack must have some old valves and capacitors gathering dust in a storeroom somewhere...."
"I think Carol is right to enquire whether you are due a refund at all. I'm no fan of this horrible company, but if you booked a non refundable fare type you're not going o get anything back. Their admin fees will cancel out any money back on taxes that you would be due."
Take my money but don't issue any ticket! I'll make sure to viral about the scam! I booked a flight from subang to terengganu! I already paid and no ticket received at all!!!!!! TRAVELGENIO is the biggest SCAMMER on EARTH!
"There is no point in trying to go viral. Very few, if any will take any notice. The truth is they are not a scam despite the title of this thread. They are simply a dreadful and very poor outfit. You'd have known that if you'd spent just a minute or two checking their reputation out first."
Hi Shahira. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your cooperation.
"#173Roj,correct yet again....shouting it on here will do you no good...in fact I think the experienced regular posters are getting a little bored of those who come here after the fact...but did not take a few minutes to search before booking......at least Travelgenio have taken the time to check this thread...many bigger companies do not even do that.....put it down to a learning curve...if they broke the law,put the money in dispute with your bank...if not listen to the folks on here...and learn how to travel better in future."
"Hello,I would like to share the same bad experience with Travelgenio/Travel2be (which is the same entity). They issued me a ticket that was not found by the airline at the check in and i had to buy a ticket full price the day of departure. The airline told me that this is purely a scam as Travelgenio issues tickets that are thereafter not recognized as valid (and thus voided) by the airline system. I recommend to all buyers to avoid travelgenio !!"
">> They issued me a ticket <<are you sure there was an actual ticket number issued? generally they issue a confirmation of your booking request put a hold on your funds and give you the airline reference number. Then when they deal with your request (24-48 hours later) they will see the real price and often ask for more money. When the ticket is not paid in full within a certain time period then the airline system will auto-cancel the reservationwhether you choose to book with a shonky third party or direct with the airline it is good practice to check your booking regularly on the airline website, check in online 24 hours in advance etc."
"Hi etienne53250, you will receive a reply to your mail during next few hours. Regards"
"Regardless of what the bot says, I think Carol is spot on about what really happened. I don't think Travelgenio/Travel2Be ever made a booking. And that would have become apparent had you checked for a reservation on the airline site."
Another sad tale of buyer beware and do your research. Made a booking in Aug and tickets issued. But want to change a date for one leg. Asked Travelgenio via email for fare rules; received automated reply with a job number; no further response to follow-up email requests. Airline says to contact travel agent. Frustrating.... but lesson learned for next time I book a flight.
"Hello Neil. Please could you send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating your booking reference and what changes you want to make? With that information, one of our agents will contact you to explain what the conditions for changes are under your fare. As you know, the airlines set these policies. Thank you, regards."
"Neil has already sent an email, but didn't get much of a response."
Already sent email. Here's the ticket number - #2996891. Pls respond to that.
Hi Neil. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"Do let us know if you get a reply Neil, and what it says."
"So it does not come as a surprise to me and probably not to readers of this thread that I did not receive an email from travelgenio. Why bother even posting a reply. I see 'Travelgenio Madrid Spain' has posted 3,885 times; probably as a result of a lot of other dissatisfied customers like me."
"Hello Neil. One of our agents will contact you shortly. Thank you, regards."
"Travelgenio Madrid Spain is a bot that posts replies to complaints, in the hope that this will make people believe that it offers after-sales service."
"Received an email from customer service that references a new job # (not the one I originally received) and advised the following; ""Thank you for contacting our Advanced Support Department.  We would like to inform you that the change costs would be 125AUD / 77 EUR as change penalty + 50 EUR service fee per passenger and an extra amount for the fare difference should be also added. This amount depends on seat availability and we are not able to inform you without the details of the change you wish to make (date, time, etc.)."" I have replied with the specific changes I am seeking and will await a reply before deciding whether to risk making the changes or not."
Thank you for contacting us Neil. One of our agents will contact you within the next few hours.
"Your right, Neil, the lack of a response initially and then a poor quality one comes as no surprise.The automated responses here are not fooling anyone."
So totally and utterly pointless to bother using the bot to post ridiculous replies on here. I seriously wonder if any human at Travelgenio EVER reads this forum.
"I don't suppose they do. I mean, why should they? They won't care about customer problems, and even if they did they are probably prohibited from taking any action over and above company policies."
That's why posting false offers of help is so stupid IMHO because nobody on here believes them.
"Curious to understand how the 'bot' sniffs out a post to reply to. I didn't mention the ""TG"" name in my last post but still received a reply...Anyway, I had a further reply from the advance support team after providing details of the change I wanted to make - split booking and change date of my first flight; return date unchanged. Cost would be 797 Euro / 1300 AUD. So that change won't be happening. I could buy two fares to NZ for that money. Tim R - if you can do a better price, let me know :)"

"‪@travelgenio you took my money 13 days ago, and have not sent flight confirmation or issued a refund. I have sent several emails and contacted you via your website. At this stage I can only presume you are frauds. Reimburse my money before I contact trading standards. ‬"
Nicole - you are not speaking to Travelgenio - it is possible that their bot may pick up on your message but it is not the correct way to contact them as this is a PUBLIC travel discussion forum. You need to contact your credit card company if you suspect foul play
Thank you for contacting us Nicole C. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference and one of our agents will get back to you as soon as possible to let you know the status of your booking. Thank you
"There you go Nicole - ""the Bot"" has noticed your post on this public forum, but is simply requesting that you email travelgenio's customer service including your booking etc reference - you are not going to be dealt with any quicker posting on here Actually having a trail of emails is good - it is evidence should you need to involve your payment card provider of ""who said what and when"" but I suspect that their refund processing is a much slower transaction than the initial collection of payment (and their booking fees) . BTW - Have you checked all through the T&Cs you agreed to when trying to place the reservation with them in the first place ? If not, you may find what you need in them (http://uk.travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and-conditions ). Have you actually checked with the airline itself yet as to whether the flights were ever bookedEdited: 10:59 am, December 11, 2019 "
"There is a lesson to be learned there - stop looking for a bargain that doesn't exist and simply book flights direct with the airline - websites like TG don't have live pricing so the price they offered the tickets at was probably madly unrealistic which is in all likelihood why they never actually managed to secure them for you . The problem you now have is getting the money back but at least if they never booked them for you in the first place and are simply being slow to pay you back that is something your card payment provider can sort out eventually. It is bound to be stressful having to find the money to rebook your tickets elsewhere in the meantime, but you seem confident that the bank will get it back for you eventually so that at least is a plus."
"Please don't think for a moment that Travelgenio are in some way unique in being rubbish, Nicole, and that all other booking sites are good or worth using.There are a large number of shonkies out there, and even using a decent site can add unnecessary complication by placing another company in between you and the supplier."
"actually I booked today Dec.15,2019 we have the same experience in travelgenio its really gave stressed to me coz they deducted on my credit card but they didn't issue my Itinerary therefore I call the customer service until now Im waiting feedback from them regarding my bookings if they will refund or not. but for those who planned to book please do not try to travelgenio."
"you submitted a booking request, they place a hold on funds. You should know in the next 24 hours or so if they can fulfil your request (or whether the advertised fare is not available)Many online ticket floggers don't have live pricing and operate in the same way.If you want to see live prices and have instant confirmation, you can do this by going to the airline website."
Thank you for contacting us Trail50800257465. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference and one of our agents will get back to you as soon as possible to let you know the status of your booking. Thank you
#207 That's not fair ! It was my turn to be the TravelGenio bot today!
"Trail, Carol is spot on. I doubt that contacting them by email as the bot advises would speed things up. They will tell you in their own good time whether your booking request could be fulfilled or not."
"I also bought expensive tickets through travelgenio, got sick the day before, luckily I was fully covered with cancellation insurance and change insurance, however , here allmost a month after I still have not been reimbursed, their costumerservice simply do not answer mails send to them, or come back with useless answers, and their costumer service on phone is the rudest most hopeless costumer service I have ever met in my life.I have mails from them, confirming they will pay within 48 hours, which are long overdue, I was told they were transferred on the 17/12 and that I should check my bank (which I allready had done, and have done again), and the last person I talked to, hardly spoke english and just kept screaming at me manicly “you must wait, you must wait, you must wait...It is a con company, please do not fly with them ever or buy anything from them, I have to go the heavy road through lawyers and so on now, mostly to make sure they are not allowed to continue their horrible, horrible company..."
"Many thanks Thomas for your feedback. One of our agents will review your case. Please could you send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com explaining the details. Thank you, regards."
"#210 - ThomasA Bot will be here shortly telling you ..........don't believe a word.........you should have researched them before,but sadly you waited until after...,,,,you can always try and dispute the original amount with your card provider...Good Luck"
If your trip was cancelled due to sickness the fastest route would have been to claim on your travel insurance policy Thomas - you did have independent travel insurance didn't you ?
Exactly.Never buy your travel insurance from your travel provider.
"Hi,I booked a ticket yesterday from Munich to Kolkata on your partner website Travelby through Skyscanner.com. When I searched on Skyscanner i was shown a price of 655 euros per person. On visiting the website from Skyscanner, the website still showed me 655 euros per person. But when I completed the booking, I noticed that my card had been charged 1374.94 euros, which brings the per head price to 687.5 euros, hence being 32.5 euros per person more expensive than shown initially. This is absolutely perfect unacceptable. I hereby request you to refund me 65 euros that was charged extra to me. Thank you. Regards,Anant Goenka"
Who are you asking to refund you? I’m afraid you’re asking in the wrong place.
"Hello Sphinx321. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with the details of your booking and the amounts on which you have doubts so we can review your case and give you an answer? Thank you, regards."
"Best of luck with your quest, Sphinx. Based on a quick reading of this thread, you are one of the BETTER off customers of this sham company.I hope your tickets are legit, and I hope your complaints are not misunderstood by the company as a request to cancel them, but that action would not surprise me."
Well sphinx the simple answer is they dont have live prices. Could also be their fees. They dont work for nothing.They're truly awful and you'd have realised that if you'd bothered to spend a few minutes researching their reputation before handing over your money.You got off pretty lightly compared to many.
I think the chances of getting money out of TG are probably going to be less than 1%.I think that it's likely the extra money is down to fees that are listed somewhere but which you didn't spot.
"Avoid buying tickets via travelgenio.com at all cost. I bought flight tickets on their site. On every page there was a discount. I have accepted the ""total price"" and they have blocked 100 euro extra from my account, then charged it (that's why I didn't get sms from bank to confirm the price). I tried to explain this ""mistake"" with their support. It took me 2 weeks to explain it to them but they didn't want to refund me the price difference, according to them, everything is correct. So it wasn't a mistake, it was a fraud! I totally don't recommend this company."
Hello Arkadiusz. Of course we can help you with your queries on the amounts for your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your booking reference and your queries about this and we will check the details immediately. Regards.
"I also got hurt by TravelGenio.To be fair, I do want to mention that after I was very active and made many calls and emails I did got my money back.This was a very sad moment when I was trying to go back home after the funeral of my beloved grandfather. What can you do?!- I suggest to all people who got scammed by TravelGenio to write a complaint and tell their story to Skyscanner or other sites and online partners who recommend them. This will do the best outcome you can ask for.- To all people who didn't get their money back and didn't get their product; you can talk to your credit card company and file a chargeback against them. Good day and good luck."
"Hi Yonatan, we feel happy to read you have received the refund. Bear in mind that, as a third party, it depends on airline authorisations and rate conditions to be able to process them. We keep at your disposal. Regards"
I was also very happy to read hat Jonathan got the refund in the end. I was not so happy o see that he had to make many calls and emails while waiting.My advice is to book direct.
"TravelGenio is a ScamI wish you would have got me my ticket which I've paid for with so much positive effort as your marketing team that uses ""politeness"" to do disinformation online and make sure you seem like a legitimate firm who is trying to do the best they can... Your SMM (social media marketing) manager deserves a bonus.So for the readers out there:I received my refund so fast because I was about to Chargeback and hurt their relationship with their CC processing partner and other partnerships. This is why I wrote ""to be fair I got my money back""Ideally, I should have gotten my ticket and not spend several days on getting my calls shut down in my face by you only to discover that you've canceled my ticket already and didn't inform me. I've read so many examples of people who didn't know what to do and it makes me so sad.I know exactly what happened with my ticket and I believe that TravelGenio (also known as Travel2Be) did it intentionally. Now dear social media manager, own this negative review. This is why the internet exists."
"Hi Jonathan, any further details regarding the refund process can be dealt by mail. As a third party, once airlines authorise them, they can be handled and processed. Regards"
"i am very sad and worried that I bought return tickets from TravelGenio via Skyscanner but I was advised by Air Canada Airline the departure ticket has not been issued even i fully paid online in Sep last year. Luckily my trip is in the coming April so I still have time to get it fixed. However, I have sent my requests to Travelgenio by Facebook messenger and to their ""contact us form"" in thier website 3/4 times but still no reply. Air Canada told me the passenger will not allow to go on plane even got the eticket as under my booking reference there is only itinerary shown in the airline system, not ticket issued, so weird. Does that mean the eticket is fake? I asked Travelgenio to linkup the eticket to the booking reference but no response. What can I do?"
"If you paid by credit card, raise a formal dispute with your card company."
Hello Uni. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.

"I have sent email to your customer service already.My booking number BSK95MEdited: 3:40 am, January 24, 2020 "
"Hi Sydneynick, thanks for your suggestion. yes, I paid by credit card but how I can get refund as I paid in Sep last year."
"Uni, One of our agents will contact you shortly. Moreover, when contacted in September, you were informed the booking was not confirmed under mail reference 2804676. Thank you, regards.Edited: 4:10 am, January 24, 2020 "
"Travelgenio, unfortunately I never received your email about my booking was not confirmed. Whereas, I received your confirmation and e-tickets. However, when I called to Air Canada to check my booking and I was shocked to know my departure ticket actually is not issued in their system. I told them I have got e-tickets from your company, but they advised me it's just an itinerary and nothing is confirmed under my booking reference. I think your company should contact the airline to clarify this issue and get back to me asap. Thank you."
Our agents will inform you asap. Regards
"Uni, please keep us updated!"
"Uni... along with RojBlake please do keep us updated. Your experience and frustrations may serve as a warning to others thinking of booking with Travelgenio. Hope it works out for you shortly, otherwise, pursue via your credit card company because if the booking is not confirmed and Travelgenio have your money... seems to me that they have not delivered what you have paid for."
"Hi Uni, our team has just sent you all the details for the two tickets booking in mail reference 2804676. Follow please that mail chain for further details"
"Just received Travelgenio's CS email which they still insist they have correctly issued the airtickets. I replied and requested them to coordinate with Air Canada airline and let me know when they have done this. Then, I will call Air Canada again to check if this issue has been resolved or not. Hope I finally can get the tickets."
I also wrote to Skyscanner about this issue and Skyscanner replied that they will assist to follow this up with Travelgenio. Hope they can help to work this out.
"I wouldn't have high hopes of Travelgenio resolving anything. Firstly, it's cheaper for them not to do much to help, and secondly I imagine that the majority of their staff are not trained to say or do anything other than what they are instructed to do or say by their screen.I hope I'm wrong, obviously.Edited: 12:03 pm, January 24, 2020 "
"Received email from Travelgenio telling me they have fixed the ticket problem with Air Canada. Then, I called and checked with Air Canada and luckily they confirmed both ways tickets have been issued under my booking reference now.However, Air Canada reminded me that travel agents can always cancel or change my tickets/booking anytime. I hope Travelgenio is honest and not a scam to do tricks on my booking later.I will monitor closely with Air Canada for my tickets till April and keep update here."
Many thanks for your comments. We will pass your words on to our team. Regards
"Uni,Thanks for keeping us updated. It is always a good idea to get into the habit of monitoring flights on the website of the airline even WHEN you book direct (which I hope you do in the future). I have previously experienced a changed flight time on a flight booked direct where an email advice was not received, and it is certainly not uncommon for changes by the airlines not to be advised to the punter by third parties. Where a third party is involved the airline will not advise you of changes as you are not the customer of the airline."
Updated Skyscanner OTA ratings...Travelgenio 1.5/5These are genuine scores from people who book after searching on Skyscanner........one of the lowest ratings I have ever seen there....and could explain why their Bot is a busy Botty!
"Actually, I find myself surprised that it's that high..."
What is CC?
CC = Credit Card
"why don't sue the Travelgeio ??? IF you have evidence, then just do it. Don't let it go....."
"You have to have legal grounds to sue Navigate - if they have done something which their T&Cs entitle them to do ( ie charge large sums in fees for amendments and cancellations etc etc) then they can do it and you do not have grounds to sue them even if you are not happy with how much it has cost you! Anyone booking through them online goes through a number of fields during the process one of which is a section in which they are told that by proceeding further they are accepting the published T&CS - if someone does that without reading said T&Cs properly then that is their own fault unfortunately - they have still agreed to them :-(Edited: 6:18 am, February 07, 2020 "
"While outfits like Travelgenio don't spend anything more than the bare minimum on support functions, I reckon they splash out on top lawyers who will make their T&C's just about as watertight as they can be.That's money well spent from their point of view. Unlike investing in customer service."
"My flight was changed to where i was 5 hrs ate to my connecting flight, I submitted a refund request it's been 5 months now and they kept on saying that it is the air company that is not refunding and as soon as they get the money from them they'll return it to me. Well I called the air company today and they said the refund was processed a few months back. When I called travelgenio they said there's nothing they can help me with and hung up on me!!!Very frustrated!"
"#253,Unfortunately, a common theme. Few skonky 3rd party agencies, ever refund $.Best of luck.Hunt"
"Mari,Posting the same thing multiple times, does zero good.Likely that folk might report ALL of your posts as spam.Once is enough.Hunt"
"Oh, it was a mistake, I didn’t mean to..."
"Hello Mari. Let us check the status of the refund with the airline, as you know it is the airline that manages and approves refunds. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking so we can raise the query? The refund times vary depending on the airline. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you, regards."
Hi. Did you end up getting your refund? Unfortunately we are waiting for a refund for a cancelled flight and are having similar issues.
"Did you contact the company’s email address in this thread, Pratik?"
"Thank you Pratik for your feedback. To review your case in detail, please could you write to us at customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the details, so we can check what happened?. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards."
I did. But I get the same generic reply as everyone. I contacted the airline and they said they take a maximum of 5 days to refund the fare. On the other hand travelgenio takes 15days to 3 months. The airline has asked me for a reference number for the refund request but travelgenio is unable to provide it.
"Thank you for letting the world know about Travelgenio. I was a click away from purchasing an international round trip ticket, and then I saw your post. I am going to go with another company to purchase my ticket.Blessings!Edited: 10:50 am, February 18, 2020 "
"I hope 'the other company"" is the airline , not yet another outfit like Travel Genio.."
"Their was an involuntary change by Virgin Airlines, I contacted travelgenio in Nov 19 for cancellation of my flights and full refund. I was told my refund will be processed. But since then I have received no refund from them. I have contacted many times on phone and email as well but no response. They are a fraud."
"Have you contacted your credit card company, Sunil?What were the dates of the scheduled flights?Why did you not book directly with Virgin?"
"Hello Sunil. Let us check the status of the refund with the airline, as you know it is the airline that manages and approves refunds. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your booking so we can raise the query? The refund times vary depending on the airline. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you, regards."
Also facing the same issued while booking and they charge me double for the booking still not getting my ticket
Thank you for contacting us Abhishek. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your reference and explaining what doubts you have so we can study your case and give you an answer. Thank you.
"Hi, I have had similar problems with travelgenio, Absolutely no costomer service at all dreadful company."
Hello TumblePack. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
"due to Coronavirus, my air flight is cancelled by air line under Russia government and Korea government but Travelgenio don't answer my question. i do really need help for get reimbursement. hope this will get some feedback from Travelgenio.my booking no is 16979902. i sent so may mails and make calls but they don't response. Travelgenio plz do prompt react in this national danger, and help me. i want to get full refund."
Thank you for contacting us Yun. One of our agents will contact you within the next few hours.
When? You are doing just automatic message.. you shall make all things rightly in the right time.
Did you ( hopefully) pay for this with a credit card? If so contact the credit card company for assistance.. as you can see Travel Genio will just keep stringing you along pretending to be helping...the card company has some clout with getting refunds..
Mails are replied during the following 48/72 hours after reception. thanks
"I planned this trip from last December so payment was already done. anticipated so much but this disaster ,beyond my control, is happened. I truly hoped don’t shut down air line but government did. So frustrating by travelgenio CS and my ruined trip. I will do everything to get Refund from travelgenio and i do believe travelgenio will help me willingly and promise me to do payback."
OMG!!!You really believe Travelgenio will help you willingly!!!That's the funniest thing I've read on here today.
Then what am i supposed to do ? :( .... anyway i will try my best wish me luck.
Good luck Yun. You’re currently communicating with a bot not a person from TG. Set your expectations low and be prepared59 raise a dispute with your credit card provider.You chose a terrible ticket flogger well known for providing abysmal customer service in good times and these are far from good times.
"As long as you paid by credit card you can get the card company to assist you even if the payment is done- that is who you should be contacting.. if you paid by bank transfer, debit card etc, I fear you will never see your refund-.."
Yun please continue to post here about how soon TravelGenio contacts you ( if ever) and what they do to assist you- they have a long reputation on Trip Advisor for doing nothing- let's see if they redeem themselves and actually help one of their customers. Many of us would be happy to be wrong about them...
My flight was cancelled due to Airline bankrupcy and Travelgenio hasnt returned me my payment for 5 months now. I have been trying to contact them since then. They dont even take my calls. Its a huge scam! Please read this before you buy from them.
>> cancelled due to Airline bankrupcy <<If the airline is bankrupt then there will be no refund from Travelgenio....they used your money to purchase a plane ticket...they are a middleman and will pass on refunds after they are received from the airline....in the case of a bankrupt airline this will not be happening so they have nothing to refund you with.Maybe your credit card company or travel insurance will be able to help.
"Thank you for contacting us Dilara. As you know, refund times in case of bankruptcy depend on various legal processes within the airlines, and travel agencies are subject to these. In any case, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference so that we can check the status of processing with the airline. Thank you. "
"""so that we can check the status of processing with the airline""That would be a good trick if the airline no longer exists."
"We bought JAL tickets for the flight to Tokyo and back for March 2020 (via Travelgenio). Because of the coronavirus, the airline has issued a statement that anyone who wants can cancel their ticket and receive a 100% refund.I am writing to Travelginio on this matter, of course no reply...If someone manages to do something similar, please let me know.Edited: 3:58 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Absolutely Dilâra Yucesan - if an airline has gone bust then that ""Bot Speak"" phrase should always be read as "" bankruptcy proceedings take years and as an unsecured creditor holders of flight tickets will NOT get anything"" There is no point waiting months and months for something which will NEVER arrive - it isn't Travelgenio's fault, it is just the result of a company 's insolvency - if there is no money to pay out to unsecured creditors, you will get zilch As Carol has already told you , you should be trying to see if you can recoup your losses through your credit card company/ travel insuranceEdited: 4:03 am, March 02, 2020 "
Thank you for contacting us Gllon. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your reference and explaining what queries you have so we can get you an answer in about 48/72 hours by mail. Thank you.
"I paid extra services to travelgenio for customer service, I send them dozens of emails, tried to call them, no one replies, no answer to emails, everytime you write here they ask ""please send mail to customer....."", no replies, I just wanted to ask about refund. If you are so poor in providing customer service, why you charges extra for priority customer service?"
>> I just wanted to ask about refund <<before wasting more time.....has the airline cancelled your flight? Is the airline offering cancellation waivers for your route/date?If not it is 99.9% likely that you have a non-refundable ticket and there will be no refund...what were the fare rules when you purchased?
"Hi Samrat B, please send us a private message with all the booking details and we will check if your mail wass received in customer.service@travelgenio.com and why it was not replied in 72 hours. regards"
"No the airline didn't cancel flights, it's due to the virus, if it spreads in India then the country from where I am travelling might cancel flights to india."
"Then cancellation is your own choice, and your financial loss."
"Samrat - the problem you have is that at the moment you are apparently only ""disinclined"" to travel ,not that the airline has cancelled the flight - there is a very important difference . If you cancel now you probably won't get any money back whereas if you wait for the flight to be cancelled and it is you will get the cost refunded (less the TG processing fees that you signed up to when you booked) but of course in waiting you still run the risk of it NOT being cancelled in which case it is your decision whether to fly as planned or not and if you don't the money spent is wastedEdited: 8:50 am, March 02, 2020 "
"I bought a ticket through travelgenio from Budapest to Osaka via Beijing with AirChina. As per AirChina`s website, they will refund all e-tickets starting with 999... So my tickets qualify, but travelgenio is not doing anything about it.My Booking refference: YQEGVEExtremely disapointed."
"#295 - If your flight was canceled, the airline will refund to Travelgenio, who will deduct any fees and eventually refund the rest to you. There are many thousands of cancellations; you will just have to be patient and keep checking."
#295.Not much use telling members of Trip Advisor you ref number. We can't do anything !
"Adi, Many thanks for your comments. We will pass your feedback on to our team and we will contact you during next 72 hours. Regards"
"Travelgenio!WHAT do you mean ""Many thanks for your comments""?Adi is NOT saying anything good about your dreadful company he is complaining that you have NOT helped him!!!For all our sakes.....get a HUMAN to READ the posts"

"hi here is the update. after tremendus efforts for getting in touch with Travelgenio. finally and fortunately, got confirmation to retreive full refund. but it hasn't been deposited yet. i suppose in next week, can get money back. anyway Thank you for Travelgenio, for providing this valuable experience. hope others who is willing to travel in no matter what situation consider to book through Travelgenio. Thank you for their assitance."
Yun.Wow! You can not be serious?I'm sorry but your post has to be a wind up!

Your feedback will help us continue working on improving our service Yun. We keep at your disposal. Regards
"I have to admit that after reading negative reviews, I was positively surprised by Travelgenio. On Saturday I wrote the first email, on Tuesday I received a reply that my request was processed and I would receive a refund within a few days. On Thursday I had money in my account. At the moment I have no issues about the operation of Travelgenio and in the future I probably used their services.Edited: 11:58 am, March 06, 2020 "

"Poster 308 -Charlie -is based in Madrid, home office of TravelGenio. what is your affiliation to the company Charlie? Did you join TA today to try to defend your employer?"
"@Traveller from UK - maybe so, maybe without tripadvisor it wouldn't be so swift, but nevertheless i got what i wanted and it was the first time ever in my life, that i wanted a refund for a flight, so for now that's ok with me. If they will fail me some other time, i will be sure to let everyone know."
And people come on here wondering why these shonky companies stay in business.I give up!
"To my surprise, i just got an email from travelgenio. It was more than 72 hours, but hey, at least I got a reply. Pasting the response: We are writing to you regarding your booking YQEGVE.We inform you that your repayment is being processed. Once the airline authorizes it and confirms the amount to be repaid, the reimbursement will be made using the same payment method used for the purchase.You can follow up the status of your refund by replying to this email.Kind regards,Will keep you guys posted if the reimbursement will go through or not."
Thanks for your comments. We keep at your disposal. Regards
"Yet again the Bot can't post in proper Engish.""We keep at your disposal"".What does that mean???"
Thats a standard response. The money back into your account is the challenge.Good luck.
"Re Post 313 - ""..yet again the Bot can't post in proper Engish"" -sadly Traveller from UK the intended effect of your sarcasm has been somewhat lessened by your own use of less than perfect English as you misspelt the word English! I think we should stick more to the issue of whether TG is any good at doing things quickly and correctly enough than taking the micky out of the bot's grammar. The clue to the odd phraseology often appearing in messages from TG on this forum is in the Bot's given location - Madrid! Not everyone speaks (or writes) perfect English but we all hopefully generally get the message. to be fair to Travelgenion at least the company has someone looking out for messages on sites like this and trying to run a damage limitation exercise which is better than some similar agents who get bad feedback bother to do.  @ The Bot - if you meant to say Quedamos a su disposición the correct translation you need is "" we remain at your disposal""Edited: 4:15 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Well, surprise surprise, i got my money back today.Seems like it all worked out in the end. Maybe they`re just understaffed in the CS department, that they take so long to respond to a request.In the end i`m happy i got them back.Thanks everyone."
Many thanks for your comments Adi. We will pass your words on to our team. Regards
"That is good to hear Adi - Thank you for telling everyone so others can be reassured . As the old saying goes ""Patience is a virtue"" :-)"
I got my refund back after several weeks of waiting. The CS is probably overwhelmed by the number of requests and they have to take care of themselves too. Much appreciated and hope everyone stays safe.
Thanks for your comment Jeremiah. We are doing our best to process all queries. Regards
hi can you please arrange a reschedule or refund for me. I prefer to have a rescheduled flight for 2021 on similar dates. My flight details are LK9RA2.Please note I have been sending emails for approx a month with no reply. And no calls go through either.Please assist me urgently.Thank you
Hello Nishaan. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days. Thank you for your cooperation.
TRAVELGENIO is dodgy and COVID-19 was a lost opportunity for Travelgenio to show they care for their customers. My advice: pay with PAYPAL to cover yourself from dodgy online travel agents like TRAVELGENIO. Paypal has reimbursed me in full for the lost flights TRAVELGENIO did not want to reimburse me for.
My advice: Don't use dodgy online travel agents. Any of them. Ever. Do your research and understand what you are getting in to before you send them any money. The evidence is there if only one bothers to look for it.
Hi Bernardo. We are doing our best to process all queries. RegardsInfo regarding covid-19:…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
Hi.Almost a month ago that my flight should have left Australia for Spain. I paid over 2500 AUSD. I ´ve been trying to contact you by all possible ways for more than 20 days so that you can return my money as you commented in the mail. GIVE MY F* MONEY BACKBooking reference: RQBXVV
"Swearing usually helps get good customer service, Orial?"
How charming (not ) Oriol R ! I assume from your post that TG have accepted your request and you are just waiting on it to hit your bank account - I just hope you re not expecting to get 100% of what you paid back - it will be net of Travelgenios admin fees as per the T&Cs you signed up to when you booked thorough them
"Oriol: Travelgenio will not provide you with a refund until they receive it from the airline. Every airline office is in meltdown at the moment, so a realistic timeframe for the refund would be 2 or 3 months rather 20 days."
Hi Oriol. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next few days.Thank you for your cooperation.
"It looks as if the bot has standards and won't reply to the f word :-)But honestly, Oriol, it's going to take as long as it takes. Neither getting angry nor sending multiple emails to this poor company is going to speed anything up.I agree that it's more likely to take months than weeks, and I also agree that TG will charge for processing the refund."
"Greetings!My name is ZHUMAZHANOV DASTAN and my Ref. Booking ID: 17904255, and booking code is ESOYPE. I bought air ticket through services of Travelgenio . But unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the novel Coronovirus(I suppose). I sent email to address shown in ""contact us"" section, but could nor get reply. I am writting here in hope that someone from Travelgenio customer service sees. I would like to get a full refund as soon as possible, please. Also I would like to know, when is soonest possible date to get the refund? Also, if anyone could manage to contact them through phone, could you please let me know the phone number of customer service? I called to numbers shown in ""customer service"" section, but none of them responded, they are all on automatic response. Please email me back to dastann99@gmail.com.Thank you in advance.Best regards, Dastan."
"Hi Dastan, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"
"Travelgenio has to ask the airline for a refund. When this is received, Travelgenio will take its processing fee and send the rest to you. All airlines are in meltdown at the moment, and a realistic estimate of the time would be 2 or 3 months."
"I'm trying to get in touch with you for 3 days. You are not replying my emails and calls. I have purchased a ticket worth 1400 USD, and the flight got cancelled and the last reply 8 days ago was that you will create an open ticket for me, and 3 days ago when I texted you about my flight change you just keep ignoring me. Your call center is useless and I was trying on the phone for more than hour waiting for someone to pick up the call!"
"Shadiyar this is an Air Forum and you can't get through to Travelgenio here.Their customer service is appalling and it's a shame you didn't check the company out first before booking.Also, you haven't really given them long enough to refund. Ryanair just refunded a friend of mine for a flight cancelled in April. Good luck but I think your best bet might be contacting your credit card company and try to get a refund that way."
"I saw that they are replying to some users here, and though I should give it a try. Because of my flight was cancelled, they created a credit that I can use to travel with the same airline within 1 year. So it's not a refund, I'm just trying to book the ticket for another date. Thank you for your response and good luck to you too!"
"Hope it works out for you, take care."

"I have been trying to get a refund from Travelgenio since January,. My daughters flight was cancelled by the airline [Atlas Jet ] and the cost of her ticket was refunded to Travelgenio but was never handed over to my daughter. We have called and emailed approx 20 times and only once did I get a reply when I called from a lady whose name was Marian she promised the refund would arrive in two days but this never happened. I am appalled atTravelgenios complete lack of customer care, it is not acceptable to steal their customers money which seems to happen on a frequent basis."
Why have you not sought help from your bank/credit card provider Sarah C? If you are 100% certain that the airline HAS refunded them ( as opposed to are in the process of getting around to it) get in touch with the credit card company - QUICK
"Sarah: we have over 150 threads here about this company going back YEARS.Had you done any research when you bought this ticket you would have stayed far away. Choices have consequences, and choosing to buy from one of the worst companies means you will have a very hard time getting your refund.Have you tried a credit card chargeback? If the flight was in January you may already be too late, but try!Edited: 5:39 am, June 20, 2020 "

"My flight from UK to Brazil with my 2 kids was cancelled due to covid. I got a message on my phone saying Virgin Atlantic would contact me after 2 weeks. As I wasnt contact I email them and received a phone call few days later. As I havent purchased with them directly they told me to contact Travelgenio. What a disgrace this company is. Sent emails, try to phone and they never contact me back, bear in mind they have over 2k of my money in they hands. They really dont care for they customer. Will never use this rubbish company again. Think in making a complain in UK to the regulators and looking for a solicitor. Any ideas?EditDeleteShare"
"""Think in making a complain in UK to the regulators and looking for a solicitor. Any ideas?""---Why waste money going down the legal route, haven't you wasted enough already? Just speak to your credit card provider and get them to investigate. Hopefully from this you've learnt a lesson on booking airline tickets."
"Junior, no idea what regulator you’re thinking of in the U.K. that would have jurisdiction over a SA isnthe ticket flogger and a dire l e at that.its not illegal to be terrible and incompetent though.It would be much easier to try your credit card provider and get them to dispute the original payment.In future, protect yourself and do some research before handing that kind of money to any old company on the Internet. This lot have been dire for years and are even worse with the enormous backlog of covid cancellations.Their bot will be along soon to tell you to email them."
"Junior:You might want to step away from the Internet for awhile.This thread is over a year old. We have 100+ other threads on this company going back years telling you to STAY AWAY.Decisions have consequences. You chose an incompetent doctor, you're going to get sicker. You chose an incompetent travel agent, you shouldn't expect things to go smoothly. Now you get to reap the outcome, and that means waiting and waiting and waiting.And no need to post the same thing 4 times in the thread."

"i sent mail, but nothing happen , so bye bye my money"
"Malik S - It's pointless bombarding the threads. Read some of the responses from the regulars - go back to your card provider and claim that way. Also the reply button doesn't work, your post just goes to the top of the thread so no-one knows who you are talking to."
"we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
"Translation:""We ain't ever gonna pay you out of our own money, doofus. We gotta wait to get the money first. Then at some point, maybe in the next century, we'll be able to pass it on to you. After taking out our fees, naturally."""
"Spot on Roj!I vote for you being their new bot, at least your response is honest and sets realistic expectations."
what is the contact number of TRAVELGENIO?
"They don't have any contacts, Maria, which is why we have so many threads and so many posts about them.Read posts 343 and 344 for best advice in your situation."
"maria, you can check at the end of General Conditions section of our site. Regards"
Travelgenio is the top bogus company any one should stay away from them. I booked a return ticket through them. The flight was cancelled by airline so I also cancelled my ticket on that day. I also got confirmation from this site and also got confirmation through a phone call. Buts after passing almost a month they didn't return my money. In fact they don't pick up my call and nor reply my email. They are thrives. White collar thieves. Please stay away from them. Go and book direct from airline companies.
"Izhar: I am sorry this happened to you, but it happens to anyone who doesn’t do research. We have over 150 threads here about this company, how did you miss them all before giving them your money?You need to contact your friends directly to warn them, especially the ones who don’t do research. Text them, post on Facebook, Tweet. Figure out how to warn people like yourself who ignore all the warnings"

"Izhar if these were non refundable tickets, you should. It nave cancelled your. Booking. If your request to cancel showed up on their system. Efore the airline cancellation, you ay have done yourself out of being due a refund."
"It is full refundable ticket. It's from PIA airlines. They give full refund. Travelgenio also emailed me that they will refund me full amount. I also called airline and they told me that travelgenio never asked for cancelation. Now it's been one month of this story. I can post their email screen shots but here is no option. If I am going to loose 500€ to them for nothing. I will expose them every where, where ever I can"
Don't you think they have been exposed already?
Dispute with your credit card.Posting here won’t help. We have ten thousand posts here about them didn’t stop you from giving them your money
#363'Don't you think they have been exposed already?'I'm the TravelGenio Bot....and I have spent the last three month 'exposing' just how useless my company actually is!
"I sent an email just now. But I am pretty sure they will never respond because they replied to my email last week in response to an email on 18 March. Thats almost three months. It's just a shame. I also call them. In the beginning they picked my call but now I wait almost half an hour and the music is going on and no body picks and then the call drops. So how will my email help me. At least if they pick my call or respond my email, I would be satisfied."
No one is telling you to email.We are telling you to dispute your credit card bill. We are telling you to tell your friends not to use online agencies like you did.
"Hi Izhar Ul Haq, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
Sorry but booking with the airlines don't take as long as your company does to refund people back their money. This is very disappointing I'm stuck in a different country because you refuse to refund my money in a manner that is most suited during a time like this.
"You're not going to see your money for a very long time, if ever, Emarehi.Buy replacement tickets direct from the airlines, and consider this an expensive lesson learned. We have over 20,000 posts here complaining about this company going back YEARS, so you are not alone. Tell your friends!"
"#369. You won’t get any money back until the airline has refunded TG. That is likely to be a long time as TG have to request refund, airline refunds TG and TG refund you. TG bought a ticket from the airline in good faith and do not hold your money so can’t refund you until the airline does."
"Emarehi Christy O, Talking about refunds, we are constantly contacting airlines to be able to make them effective the sooner the best. Anyway, we must follow their procedures and this can take some months without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
I see the overworked Travelgenio bot is still sending out the same garbled message to everyone! I haven't looked at this forum in months but nothing changes with this company!
"I did not get any response, now it's been more than three months. almost 2 times a week I call them. they never pick.. they are big liars. because on last call they told me, within 12 days you will get your money but the fact is they never cancelled my ticket and I confirmed it from the airlines, they told me that travelgenio never asked for your cancelation.. 17803240 is the reservation number,... Ah, Man...the biggest mistake i made"
"Izhar Ul Haq, We have informed you previously how to contact us to register your petition through the link sent to the mail once mail is sent following the mentioned steps. Once done as you say, our agents will contact you as soon as the actual situation allows. Due to the actual amount of petitions, reply times have increased. Thanks"
I am replying here after you said to me to write email to them. I wrote them. But like usual they emailed me that we will contact you. It's been 21 days after that email and nothing happened
"If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
Copy ands paste reply all the time. You cheaters
"Izhar Ul Haq, have you followed the advice given to you on 23rd June to speak with your credit card provider? Responding here isn't going to help you with a refund."
"Have you heard from an agent yet, Izhar? Posting here doesn't help but a lot of us suspect that absolutely nothing happens after the TG bot has posted one of their template messages, and your story so far seems to confirm that.I hope that you have contacted your card provider. It's much easier.Edited: 1:14 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"For months I have been trying to contact Travelgenio and the phone line hangs up after a few minutes and the email address contact comes back saying that they do not recognise the booking number - even though they won’t accept an email unless you put the booking number in the subject so it has priced impossible to co tact them. They ask you to put in your email address that you used to make the booking on their contact form and they send a link to your email address and you click on the link and you go to my trips and your booking comes up. For weeks when I checked it said that they were waiting for airline approval for the refund but now when I put in my email address when I used to make the booking when contacting them it doesn’t recognise the email address and not only that but when I go to check the original booking that I made last July it says that the information doesn’t exist on their server. So basically it seems that Travelgenio keep all of your information on a server when they contact you and then they just wipe the server whenever they want, leaving no proof of any emails they sent to you. My booking has basically vanished off their system. Booking id 14968687. I’m due a refund if 2800 for flights from Dublin to Vancouver that were cancelled in April. Very distressing. The email address for their customer service also doesn’t work and this is the email address that they keep telling everyone in the reviews (ie Trustpilot) to contact but you can’t send an email to that address because as stated above, they ask you to put in the email address you used to make the booking when contacting them but then you get a reply to say that the email address doesn’t exist. And from today, funnily enough, an error message comes up when you try to send an email to their customer service email address saying “this email cannot be sent”. Have they gone bust? Seems like it to me. All I want is a booking invoice to give to my travel insurance company and I can’t even get that. So distressed. The worst company I’ve ever dealt with in my life. Will be filing a complaint to the aviation authority."
"Travel Genio are straight up thieves. They have been telling me for 4 months that they are waiting on the airline for a refund, but when i contacted the airline for confirmation of cancellation so i could claim via insurance, the airline confirm that the refund was sent to TG on the 30th March. These thieves have been lying by putting the blame on the airline, whilst all the while have been sitting on my money for four full months. Solicitors instructed."
"Sorry you found yourself in this position, Stephen. Not sure how you missed all the Red Flags about this company here. 20K complaints over the years. Just a terrible company to give your money to"
"Stephen L, We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
"sent - would like to think you'll do something this time, but my previous experience with sending e-mails to that address doesn't fill me with confidence."
"Yea, me too. I'm normally pretty good with checking. Missed it this time, although to be frank, even though I now know there are a problem, I had difficulty finding this thread in TripAdvisor."
"There are 200 threads (really!) about TG in this forum alone.If you send that email to TG as requested, you will get an email back with a link to a form on their site for you to complete. You will get an acknowledgment of that submission, and then nothing.Consider contacting your travel insurance or credit card before it's too late to file a claim"
"Thanks Northern Traveler - already done all of that. Credit card company not interested as section 75 refunds only available if I buy direct from the supplier who 'broke' the contract by cancelling flights. As my contract was with TG, and in terms of the flights TG didn't technically break the contract, I can't claim. Also contacted the Civil Aviation Authority as they are supposed to hold airlines to account - not really much help, and of course travel ins company want confirmation that I didn't cancel the booking/was a no show/break the contract myself. It's when i got the letter from the airline saying they acknowledged they cancelled the flight that I found out that they had refunded TG 4 months ago!!!!"
"It's disappointing that your credit card company won't do anything, Stephen. Did you mention section 75 when you contacted them? I don't know what the difference is with that and simply reporting that you haven't received what you paid for or a refund, but some people do seem to have gotten their money back via their card provider.I wouldn't expect the CAA to have any interest to be honest. It's probable that all airlines are taking longer to refund than they normally do, but I see TG as being the real problem here. They are very poor at the best of times, and since the pandemic hit they have become worse than useless - as you've now unfortunately discovered."
Yes those Spanish MFers just scammed me too!! Yet Skyscanner still allows there business.
"A company can make advertising in a print or digital media. It is still advertising.Skyscanner is free for the users. Obviously they need to generate some income from advertising to offer their services for free.And before handing somebody over a larger amount of money, it is worth to check with whom one enters into business.And as you have are a member since May 2014, it would have been easy to check before you pushed that ""buy"" button.Finally, TG is certainly a shonky thrid party, but they do nothing illegal."
"I don’t know, Cory. There are big MFing signs all over the internet telling you to STAY AWAY.You fell for an ad from a bad company. I hope you learned a lesson. Do you blame google when you buy something advertised there that doesn’t work? Do you blame a telephone pole when you buy something advertised there that doesn’t live up to expectations?"
"Cory, of course Skyscanner allow them to pay to advertise on their site. Skyscanner are not a consumer protection agency, they are a commercial website.I think you need to take on some responsibility for ensuring that you don't give any more of your money to people you think are MFers."
"Cory B, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
Absolute terrible company. Probably the worst I've ever dealt with. Made a booking they took payment. Never sent a confirmation email. Kept me in a ridiculous loop asking for a booking reference that they never provided. Said the email address was not valid which is completely untrue as it is autofill and I have been using it for a year. Keeps you on hold indefinitely on the phone with no clue of where you are in the queue. Now I have no booking and the flights have quadrupled in price. I am writing this while my phone sits there on hold for well over an hour. STAY CLEAR OF THIS ABSOLUTE SHAMBLES OF A COMPANY!
Call your credit card company and dispute the charge.And then learn and buy the ticket in future directly from the airline. These third party do not have live prices.
Venture554124zw please send us all the booking info in a private message to see if it was correctly issued. Sometimes it has a mispelling in the mail registered during the booking process and that is why you don't receive the booking confirmation
"#396Be more angry with yourself for choosing such a bad company,and during a pandemic!If you loose money it will be completely your own fault for lack of judgement!"
"my reservation no. 18191734actually i wanted to ask question about request refundbut, in your website... there were not menu that ""just question""so. i wrote my question in menu that ""request refund ""......then.. now..i never wanted to cancel my reservation....i never wanted to refund...but your system already is doing to cancel my reservation...so..if my resevation is canceled..i want to refund (perfect!! / no no no no no CHARGE)IF MY REQUEST REFUND IS NOT PERFECTI WILL SEND MESSAGE, WRITE REVIEW ABOUT YOUR COMPANYI WILL FIGHT YOUR UNFAIR BARGAIN..PLEASE REPLY ABOUT MY MESSAGEmerong1106@nate.com >> my e-mail adress"
@nohkwan pakRecommend to delete your post as it has your email and reservation number. With this you invite scammers.
