"Hi everyone,I know there have been a lot of posts regarding the Corona Virus and travel insurance. We are due to fly out on the 9th May, and I took out travel insurance last year. As the WHO have now classified this as a Pandemic, my travel insurance with Allianz will not cover it (Pandemic or Epidemic). We now will wait and see how things progress, but it's looking likely that we will also cancel our trip. We are going again on 20th Sep, and also took out that insurance last year, so fingers crossed for that one. Take care everyone."
"I took out travel insurance with Woolworths in October last year.I rang them today and they said I am not covered for Coronavirus as it is a pandemic and pandemics are excluded by the wording of the policy.I pointed out that I bought the policy in October last year, well before the pandemic was announced. The call centre worker, said that I could always claim and see what Woolworths would do.I will still go to Bali in April."
"Interesting. Allianz is the underwriter for ANZ Cards insurance. I was told yesterday by them (via phone) that they would not cover for cancellation any trip booked after Jan 30 but that pandemic status would NOT effect coverage for medical expenses irrespective of when the trip was booked unless it was for a ""do not travel"" country."
"Hi Fidelcastro1941,That's interesting as my insurance is with Allianz, using my ANZ card. I will contact them by phone and see where I stand then. We booked last August. Thanks."
Do please post what you learn. I spoke to a supervisor after being referred to them by the person who initially took the call. Be prepared for a long wait to get through.
"I'm on hold at the moment, although I am on my lunch break at work, so I may not get through before I have to go back to work. I will certainly post the response I get from them."
"I'm the same (booked early January) so would be interested in how you get on, brucebarrie. I trawled the PDS and it does state pandemics and epidemics are excluded from natural disaster cover."
"I have been on hold now for half an hour, and have to go back to work. I will keep trying, and post as soon as I get an answer."
"Just got through to Allianz, and the answer was a bit vague. He stated that we would not be covered for anything related to the pandemic, as per their policy. He then went on to say that as we booked last August, we could put a claim in if necessary, and it would be up to the case manager if we would get any money back. As clear as mud."
Thanks brucebarrie!
Yes most unhelpful answer.You didn't ask to speak to a supervisor?
I just spoke with our travel insurer and we are covered for Covid-19 pandemic whilst in Indonesia.
"Thanks, brucebarrie. You’d think they’d be able to give clear and consistent answers."
"I am insured with an Amex Velocity Premium card which is underwritten by Chubb insurance. I spoke to someone at AMEX and I am covered for Covid-19, including quarantine & hospital stays whilst overseas. However if I travel to a country where DFAT has declared ‘Do Not Travel’ then I am not covered."
"Sounds almost identical to advice I received from Allianz.,What bruce was told muddies the waters though."
"My travel insurance is through the commonwealth bank credit card. Booked my insurance in October for Europe and Bali. I rang them and was told I am not covered for the corona virus. But I was able to buy another insurance cover from them that covers me for hospital under any circumstances. Cost was Au$250. Worth it for peace of mind. If the warning DO NOT TRAVEL then the insurance is invalid.Edited: 2:49 am, March 12, 2020 "
"On 30 October 2019 when I booked a trip to Bali starting on 4 June I took out travel insurance with 1Cover. When the news about Coronavirus emerged I rang to check what cover would be provided and was told there was none at all. When I protested that it had been an unknown situation at the time the policy was issued I was told to “read the fine print” If we decide to cancel I hope that Emirates,Luxury Escapes,Scoopon and Expedia will give us a credit. Good luck and good health everyone"
Many people must understand that the advice given from a call centre telephonist( most likely in India or Philippines) and an actual claims/ settlement officer from an insurance company can have opposite meanings.
Agreed. That is why I made sure I spoke to a supervisor based in Oz.
"I also spoke to someone in Australia, but was surprised at the conflicting answer I received. I believe that I will not be covered for anything connected to the virus."
"""Allianz states that if you entered into a policy before 31 January 2020 – and your policy does not exclude claims arising from an epidemic or pandemic – you may be able to claim. However, if you entered into a policy after 31 January 2020, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to claim.""https:/…"
"My Allianz policy states that claims arising from Epidemic and Pandemic are excluded. Just to compound things, my employer has stated as of yesterday, if I return from Bali (and a few other places), I am not allowed to enter my workplace. It doesn't state for how long, but I'm guessing 14 days."
