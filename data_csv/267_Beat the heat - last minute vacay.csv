"Hello, we are going to get away August 6-16 last minute trying to beat the heat. Obviously I don't want to be around people. Anywhere in CO you would suggest? I've been looking at VRBO and they are slim (no more than $250/night) for a 2 bedroom because I'm picky and would like a view. If I were going to go into Rocky Mountain National Park and do a ""drive"" to avoid people is staying around Winter Park a good idea? Granby looks so desolate and non green? Or Fraser had some options. We could do a split stay and do 5 days and 5 days. Open to any ideas you think would be away from people where we can enjoy nature."
The best thing would be to vacation in Texas. Colorado really needs a break. Covid19 is spiking here. Lots of visitors from Covid19 hot spots.
You need to have a timed entry reservation to enter RMNP this year. You can check your dates but my guess is they’re mostly sold out. Everywhere in Colorado is very crowded right now. Everyone had the same idea that an outdoorsy vacation was the way to go this summer.
"Good luck finding accommodations if you're picky! All the tourist spots are packed. I haven't been to RMNP this summer, but I'd bet that there are lots of people everywhere. How about the beach instead?"
"You are going to be around people wherever you go. Mountain towns are packed. I hiked 6 miles to a high mountain lake today. Normally 3 or 4 backpackers there on a Saturday. I counted 12 tents. Passed about 10 more groups headed up on the way down. Not even walking 6 miles with all your stuff is gonna get you away from people.Edited: 9:28 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"We are getting ready for school to start up in a few weeks and that means college kids will be descending in large groups. Our local university is all about covid awareness and wearing masks but what do they have scheduled? An ice cream social to meet the other students on campus. Now how can you stay safely 6 ft. apart, meet your new classmates and eat ice cream with a mask??? I'm not ready for this. : (Please don't come."
"Yuck. Yeah, I don't really want a mountain town. I'm thinking a place away from people where I can safely social distance. I order everything online and I don't go in public unless I have to. I wear a mask. My husband will be working so he'll need strong wifi. Again, not coming there to ""go and do"" I'm coming there for a nice walk in the evenings when hubby gets off work and pretty view.For RMNP I do have 5 reservations that I grabbed. I can cancel them if I need to, but wasn't planning on getting out the car unless we can find a non-touristy trail that no one cares about.So no towns that are sleepy? Preferably with a Target or Walmart I can order online from if I run out of anything?"
PS I didn't realize mountain towns were busy in non ski season.
"Thanks for the report, 618keith. Very sobering. I like to primitive camp, but yikes! The alpine lakes aren't big enough to handle that many campers. Thinking about the logistics of setting up 20-25 tent sites, safely storing food in bear canisters, digging proper holes for human waste, and having enough elbow room between people, how can that be done? And if the wilderness is that crowded, that's not fun at all. I can't imagine how packed the easy access destinations are. Then add coronavirus on top of it.If that's how it is, the decision is simple. Stay closer to home"
Mountain towns are where you go to escape the heat...If you want a walmart near you are going to not be anywhere sleepy. You will be in the front range cities/suburbs or near one of the bigger mountain towns. Or a place like grand junction...which is not a heat escape is summer.
"Yeah, the mountain towns are packed. I was in Vail a couple of weeks ago. Mob scene and nobody was wearing a mask. (see link) Decided to head down to Palo Duro in Texas for some cool weather.…pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/VailReso…Edited: 9:10 am, August 02, 2020 "

"Anywhere in Colorado is probably cooler than Frisco right now. :) If you're along the front range (Denver, Co Springs, Fort Collins) we have some hot days, but we have some coolish cloudy days as well, and our nights are so nice. Lots of people want the cool mountain weather with good views. I can't really think of a place that's big enough to have Walmart, good views and no tourists. Co Springs is a big area, so maybe you could find something around there and just avoid tourist areas."
"A good business owner will never tell you to your face that they don't want your money. That's what the hospitality business is all about. But behind closed doors, and in private, and even on this forum, many of us business owners are relieved to get through another busy weekend full of tourists that should really be staying home for awhile. Every day we pray to not spread this to our loved ones because of the professions we choose. People like Tyler have never worked the service or hospitality industry, because otherwise he would understand that there are two sides to every coin. A happy face while working, does not mean they aren't suffering anxiety, stress, and fear every day they come to work and then go home to their families at night. For many, the consequences of working these trades right now is real. And to diminish the very valid and current state-of-affairs opinions of the posters on this site, many of whom have thousands of posts and have invested hundreds of hours of their free time to give recommendations and travel advice over the years, is nothing but rude. All of us wish to continue to recommend the best-this or best-that on this forum, and someday, we'll get back to that. But, times are different right now. It's is very much a legitimate concern for the top posters here to dissuade travel to our state at this time. To disregard that, to delegitimize that, shows the worst in humanity, and proves to many that those who are traveling right now just really don't care about anyone but themselves."
"Frisco, Colorado is a mountain town, has great mountain views from many areas, and has a Walmart.https:/…https://www.walmart.com/store/986-frisco-coIf you are not an avid hiker, you do not need 5 timed entry permits for 5 days in RMNP. The park is not that large. There are only 120 miles of roads (paved and unpaved) in RMNP. You can drive every road in RMNP in about 6 hours. From Winter Park, it is the west side of RMNP that you can easily access. The west side is more about the Colorado River and the Kawuneeche Valley. Eighty percent of the people who visit RMNP enter from Estes Park and visit the east side of RMNP. It would take you about 2.5 hours (5 hours round trip) over Trail Ridge Road to get from Winter Park to the Bear Lake area (popular and still crowded) from Winter Park. From Winter Park, you need two days for RMNP - one to drive and explore Trail Ridge Road and make this loop including the Peak to Peak Scenic Byway. Here is the route.https://goo.gl/maps/fyt4Ktp6HPBwYTdT9The second day would be for some hikes on the west side.https:/…208x14.pdf"
"EricP, no doubt the mountain towns are packed and more people should stay away. But come on, that picture is not from a few weeks ago. Snow on the roof and people wearing ski helmets and goggles. REALLY?"
I'm guessing Eric's post was sarcastic.
Yeah it was a joke. Stay home people.
"I don't know where Alli lives but those opinions are not from someone living here in Breckenridge, or Summit County for that matter. I own a local professional services business and my business depends on local clients. My local clients depend on tourists. We are all part of the same food chain. Anyone who discourages people from visiting is basically saying none of us matter. How selfish and inconsiderate. We haven't had a spike in cases and only 2 covid related deaths. Wear your mask and wash your hands and have a great time."
Excellent point. Nobody is forcing the businesses to OPEN.
Kap you've been spewing your anti science BS all over the forums. Not just the Colorado forums. WTAF?
"Not “ anti-science” at all. If businesses are open, take reasonable precautions and patronize them. If you are at-risk or just plain scared, stay at home in your bubble. Win-win."
"My diabetic niece has every right to be able to shop in her own grocery store without fear of being accosted by a non-mask wearer, or someone that refuses to keep their 6' distance (which, really, it should be 25', 6' is arbitrary). People that are at-risk have every right to be outside, go to stores, and live the life they normally live. Telling them to go 'stay in their bubble' is a cowardly, bully response. Nobody should be forced to give up their freedom to life so that others can take a vacation. Your 'freedom' stops when my life or lives of my family members are on the line. I am pro-life, and this is no different. Respect life. Stay. Home. We will all have a giant free-for-all, hug-fest party when this is done. But until then..."
"And people that are not carriers and are not at high risk similarly have every right to be outside, go to stores, and live the life they normally live. Assess your own situation/risk tolerance/""science""/fear and act accordingly.Edited: 9:18 pm, August 04, 2020 "
How do they know they are not carriers? You can be presymptomatic for 7 to 10 days.
"Thanks all. Definitely an interesting read of responses...I should have made popcorn. I appreciate all input of course. Thanks @fv1989 for the sheet of hikes on the west side. :) This is awesome!! For those of you who do read this that were wondering the same thing...we came to Keystone (I had posted on my facebook and many people replied) and it has been amazing. We've been able to do all kinds of hikes and drives and have not felt threatened at all. We've ordered from City Market (Kroger) online twice and both have been same day pickup and they bring to our trunk and we open and close the trunk. To go food from a pizza place (sorry cannot remember name...I'll look it up), The Lost Cajun and popped into Inxpot the first morning we were here. We drove up thru Raton so it brought us thru Breckenridge and it was sooooooo busy just driving thru. When we got to Keystone I was worried, but I didn't need to be...it's dead. I haven't seen a soul in our condo complex and the Keystone lake I'm looking at has people but very distanced and not many. We are going to RMNP tomorrow so are super excited to see the park! It might just turn into a drive, but we'll gauge when we get there.Things we've done that I didn't ever feel ""threatened or exposed"" or lots of people....Lower Cataract Falls Loop (awesome and no crowds)South Illinois Creek Trail (we went in the evening...only saw one other couple at the troll)Blue Lakes Rd. (everyone was very spread out and we saw sooo many mountain goats...so beautiful!Things I would be careful of...Sapphire Trail Overlook (only if you skip the actually brick overlook on the left as you park..that's where the people are...the rest of the loop is bare)Breckenridge Gondola (packed parking lot...)I would say about 75% of people are wearing masks here on the trails if not more. Very few were without and the ones that were without were kids."
"""How do they know they are not carriers? You can be presymptomatic for 7 to 10 days.""Common sense precautions will reduce the risk of a disease that has a negligible mortality rate."
"Glad you're having a nice trip, TexasGingerbread! This is such a weird time for travel. I'm curious to read about your experiences at RMNP, and whatever else you do."
Interesting that the photo has snow in it and everyone is wearing ski clothes. Nice try.
