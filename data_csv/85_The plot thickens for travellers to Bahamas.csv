https://www.bahamas.com/tourism-reopeningNo commercial America flights
"The plot is pretty simple -- no mystery there. Due to rising numbers fo cases in the US, the Bahamas has simply closed our borders to US travellers -- as have many others countries, including Canada. International flights from Canada, the UK, and the EU are still permitted -- just no flights from the US or US citizens. This takes effect at midnight, Wednesday, July 22nd."
Commercial flights Private planes boats still allowed I’m told
"Yes, that is my understanding too. But it will bear looking closely at the actual Emergency Orders for clarification on this point."
"Just went back and looked at the national address transcript and it specifically states --Private international flights and charters for Bahamians, residents and visitors will be permitted.Pleasure craft and yachts will also be permitted. It makes no distinction where these private flights or vessels come from, just that all passengers must comply with the travel requirements, including a negative RT-PCR test and the accompanying documentation. This appears to be a loophole of sorts, but the effect is that it drastically reduces numbers of incoming passengers. Yes, the post above suggests there be a way to allow those not living in hot sports entry to the Bahamas -- and you do (see above), but we've already had 100+ people lie and submit false test results.. What's to stop people from claiming they live in East Podunk and really be coming from a hot spot? Many countries have taken the step to ban US travellers, so the Bahamas isn't alone in this - and even offers a small loophole as well."
Just Curious as to what happens Americans already in The Bahamas is there a time they have to leave or can they continue their vacations as normal .
"Hi @donK_00,Outgoing flights will be permitted to accommodate any current visitors scheduled to return to the United States after Wednesday, July 22."

"@DonK ... I’ve been wondering that same thing. Yes, as TheBahamasOutIslands explains, *outgoing* flights from the Bahamas will be allowed. OK, I understand that. But as no travelers will be allowed to arrive on flights from the U.S., are JetBlue, American Airlines, Delta, Silver, et al gonna fly *empty* planes from the U.S. over to NAS and ELH every day, on their regular sked, to bring back their customers who are already in the Bahamas? I don’t know that anybody other than the airlines can answer that question, but I’d be really amazed if it worked out that way. We’ll see, I guess ..."
"I agree, the US airlines are not going to be willing to fly in empty to take a few stragglers home for long. Shortly we will be back to Aztec being the only scheduled flights to the US. If you want off the rock now is the time."
