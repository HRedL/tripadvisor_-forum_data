"I can't seem to find any current updates on Cabo San Lucas. Anyone have updates on any restaurant closures, beaches, hotels, bars, etc... Curious as we cancelled our trip (March 23 to April 6th) last minute and I'm trying to figure out what it's like right now?!? We usually stay at Pueblo Bonito Los Cabos Beach Resort on Medano beach. Any updates welcome!"
"Hi Navigator788452, and welcome to TripAdvisor forums.We've been 'chatting' about the pandemic for some time. Read the other threads.The Blanco and Rosé are closed.

Place will be up and running by May! It's almost CABO time

"Yeah, no...Cabo won't be ""business as usual"" by May. That's foolish. The virus has already mutated twice which will move the viral peak another few weeks into the future. This is unprecedented, something the medical community has never witnessed before. An optimist would belive that Cabo will be safe to travel to in July. And even that is being generous. Don't bet on it!"
It's like you people are begging to keep this going on! Have some optimism and faith... hospitals are not overflowing. Cabo time will be soon
"Wow, thanks for the update!"
All the resorts in the Solmar 'family' are closing.
"""You don't make the timetable. The virus makes the timetable."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci, 3/25/20This is all that we can be sure of."
Apparently you've never heard of New York. US cases are now more than anywhere in the world and growing.
Part of the issue is whether you will be able to get across the border and back. That could pose a big problem
PROV1_ASU:  looking forward to details of your May trip.
I have had zero bookings for my Airbnb in the past month and a bunch of cancellations. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. Hopefully no hurricanes this year!
"Just an FYI, Southwest cancelled all of their flights effective March 22, 2020 until May 4, 2020. That is for now.....it may be extended."
Yesterday the Head of the Ministry of Health in Baja California Sur predicted that COVID-19 infections will reach their peak in June.
"Also yesterday, Hugo López Gatell, Undersecretary of Prevention and Health Promotion (Mexican federal government), said that Mexico will begin seeing the maximum rate of transmission of the virus and highest number of cases per day by mid-April. (He had a specific date - April 19 - but I chose to be less precise in my comment.)Edited: 12:11 pm, March 27, 2020 "
I would be curious to hear number of tests those officials have given for Baja.
"bearinthefield, from what I have read, they are following the same restrictive guidelines originally put out by WHO. Initially you had to have come from China, etc, to being in contact with a known CV infection. Hard to show the contact with a known, if you don't look for knowns. So yeah, there are definitely more there than are being reported simply because of the lack of testing."
"Jefe, especially hard as you can be asymtomatic and still spread it. I always appreciate your insight and contributions to TA."
"The main specialist for the UK who originally predicted 500,000 deaths in the UK alone has backed off that and his team is now predicting 20,000. That's jus a little difference. Another group from Oxford has studied the same models and predicts a number far lower than even 20,000 but didn't give an actual number. Bottom line, if you're following this thing at all, you'll see that people are throwing out all kinds of numbers and quite frankly some of them, like California's Governor Newsom, are just shooting from the hip and will be made to look like fools in the end."
"To be fair the prediction of 500K in the UK (and 2.2M or something like that in the US) was if nothing was done. A lot of things have been done, so I'm glad the predictions are coming down."
Here is some knowledge for you:…harvard.edu/flash/…Cabo time is soon! Let's go it's like you people are begging for this to go on!
"In every potential biological emergency I have ever witnessed, brave people, usually our health care providers, risk their lives to try to control the impact of the biological agent on our population. That is happening right now where understaffed and under supplied health care professionals are making a difference in the outcome of this CV-19 pandemic. In every one of these emergencies there are also those that ignore all the sacrifices made to control things, and when the outcome is not what could have happened without those efforts, say “See, I told you things weren’t that bad” or “Gee, don’t you look foolish.” I wondered when that would happen on this forum and now I know by reading comment 19 above. What I would like to do is correct some of the misconceptions posted there.First of all the contention that Dr. Ferguson and his Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team were wrong about their appraisal that 500,000 people in the UK (2.2M people in the US) could die from COVID-19 is nonsense. Their team looked at the potential of for deaths (over 2 years, not 1 year) caused by this virus based on a range and combination of suppression and mitigation actions from DOING NOTHING to LOCKING DOWN THE WORLD POPULATION (emphasis added for your attention, not yelling). Here are the options of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) that they modeled:• Case isolation in the home• Voluntary home quarantine• Social distancing of those > 70 years of age• Social distancing of the entire population• Closure of schools and universitiesThe high estimates above were based on what the report said was the “(UNLIKELY) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behavior.” Combinations of the five NPI’s above resulted in estimated deaths (again over 2 years) ranging from a low of 5600 people to the high of >500,000 in the UK. The report did not go into details of modeled deaths in the US based on different interventions. The fact that the team is now revising their estimates based on actions that we have already taken is not a sign that they made a mistake, but a sign that the dramatic actions that we have taken is actually having an effect. Rather than call these scientists and modelers, and the politicians that have adopted some of their actions foolish, we need to thank them for their efforts. Below is a list of the groups that worked on this report that has shed light on how this virus may move through our world’s societies:• WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling• MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis• Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics• Imperial College LondonThe list of authors is too extensive to post, but none of these people are fools.Edited to add: And just a final thought based on what is posted immediately above: COVID-19 is not the flu.Edited: 2:25 pm, March 28, 2020 "
Jefe: Save it.. this is all coming to an end soon whether you like it or not!
I hope so.
Well said Eljife !
"PROV1. This isn’t the flu. Now if we had a treatment for it like the flu - heck we would be golden. But we don’t. Soooo. It seems your an early 20 something that is very optimistic-good for you. But it’s time to be realistic and maybe a little responsible. I’m sure you will be able to fly to Cabo in May. Whether you will want to at that time, well that remains to be seen."
"I refer to this site almost daily and watch as the numbers just keep rising: https:/…countriesOne of the important stats here is that Mexico is 6 weeks behind the USA in terms of the onset of the spread. With the Spring Break crowds just 2 weeks ago, and the upcoming Easter Holidays (the biggest holiday for crowds in Los Cabos), cases are just going to keep rising there since the incubation period is 10 - 20 days.Reading the local news you can see that schools closed early, now the Governor has mandated the closure of bars, gyms, casinos. Church’s are asked to suspend their services. Restaurants are resorting to take-out only. A number of hotels have closed. Restrictions have now been placed on the beaches. The marina is closed to non-essential activity (i.e. no sport fishing or tours). By May, it will look like most US cities — streets, shops, restaurants, bars...all empty. So, I guess it’s a good thing also that the Governor has now also brought in the navy, army and national guard to manage the robberies and violence that will ensue as very desperate people who have no money or food will turn to desperate measures - as they have in the past. Thankfully a number of charities and local expats are starting to create food drives.Will it be fun in May? I don’t think so. But perhaps you can volunteer at one of those charities to help the people who will be gravely in need."
"No, just not trying not to be the outbreak monkey. Reality is needed sometimes."
I don't live life in fear and never will.
And he's not afraid to transmit it to someone else either.
"Unless you're in your house 24/7, you're no better. The Costco, Wal-Mart and Ralph's grocery stores near me are the busiest they've EVER been. Last week, hundreds of people were lined up like cattle an hour before Costco even opened. it's impossible to shop at any of those places without getting within 6 feet of other shoppers or employees. Oh, the horror. I just went out on a bike ride and saw the longest lines I've ever seen for the Starbucks and Taco Bell drive-thru's. I guess all those workers are immune huh? Please, the hypocrisy rise is overwhelming.Edited: 3:25 pm, March 29, 2020 "
I was there just as things started happening. All is closed down. Nothing to do. I also know people that live there and have seen pics of everything we’d just been to boarded up and closed.
PROV1....Living in fear is different from being a responsible adult who takes precautions to avoid contracting a potentially deadly virus.How is Tulum? You had previously posted you were still planning to travel there this past Wed.
"- All beaches will be closed starting March 31st -Los Cabos Mayor Armida Castro announced today that all beaches in the municipality of Los Cabos will be closed starting tomorrow, March 31st. No end date for this closure was announced."
"Thankfully the UK supermarkets have all now got a decent process in place after a few weeks of out of control bulk shopping by lots of selfish shoppers . They now make shoppers queue with a decent space between us and are just letting a few at a time into the supermarket, today I only waited 10mins and had lots of choice of fresh fruit, veg, meats and tinned food and no complaints from anyone.Everyone seems to only be shopping for what they need plus the shops have a rule saying only 3 of the same food allowed per shopper."
