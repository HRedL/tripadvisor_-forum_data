Hi I have an English friend but has residency in Kenya. He’s in England at the moment but wants to return to his business. What is the procedure on arrival? Can he self quarantine? Or does he have to go to a designated facility? Any advice would be appreciated!!
Quarantine Informationhttps:/…Kenya Quarantine Centres/Facilities ( PDF Download )https:/…Kenya Ministry of Health Portalhttps://www.health.go.ke/Good Luck
Those entering Kenya must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a government-designated facility. ... The medical quarantine will be extended an extra 14 days for those who test positive for COVID-19 in government quarantine facilities.
"'Those entering Kenya must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a government-designated facility'Wasn't this modified so that you could quarantine in your own home? I understand that a Covid-19 test certificate will be acceptable, to avoid quarantine, though how you obtain one in the UK, I am not sure, as I have had 3 tests now and have always been sent results via text. Private facility possibly?"
"""No quarantine for tourists arriving in Kenya if they don’t show COVID-19 symptoms""https:/…"
https://www.nation.co.ke/kenya/news/kagwe-fo…And now this....14 quarantine for foreign travellers per the MOH.
"""No quarantine for tourists arriving in Kenya if they don’t show COVID-19 symptoms""The OP was asking on behalf of a resident though."
So what's going on now? Are different departments of the Kenyan government pushing different policies for August? I hope not.
Does anyone know if this self quarantine will apply if we’re just catching a connecting flight to Tanzania and not leaving the airport in Nairobi?
Quarantine does not apply if you are just in transit and do not leave the airport :)
Much appreciated! Thank you for the response.
Not anymore will they quarantine
"Travel Blog,Based on today's news you seem to be wrong."
"totally confusing as usual, but to be expected .Covid 19 negative certificate from where and as my GP said they would be unwise to accept especially considering the forgeries .Kenya needs to get it rubbish act together as it relies on tourists and im not spending thousands on flights, accommodation etc to be stuck in a govt quarantine for a month and I expect they will charge a visa fee to go in to someones pocket."
Kenya airways chairman confirmed on tonights news there will not be a quarantine for people arriving with a Covid negative certificate. Evidently this is to be officially announced tomorrow or the next day.
Thank you but where do I get a Covid 19 negative certificate in the UK. I think travelers need an official statement from the President which can't be contradicted.
"As far as I have heard from MOH and KQ, a negative PCR test is what you need for entry. If there is something more, a lot of people will be caught unawares. The results need to be within 7 days of arrival."
"'Thank you but where do I get a Covid 19 negative certificate in the UK'David, you will have to go to a private clinic for this, as tests via the NHS give results by text and/or e-mail. There are a few clinics offering a service geared towards travellers - have a look online."
"""Thank you but where do I get a Covid 19 negative certificate in the UK. ""Google is your friend here- I looked this up just yesterday and had no difficulty finding several private clinics in London that offer quick turnaround tests and certificates."
"Stokeygirl,I've tried Google but in Scotland I only found so-called drive through test clinics at airports. On reading more I found they're only for essential airport workers.I'm in Kenya now but I'm asking on behalf of an old friend who lives in Scotland. He's not adept at internet."
"thanks very much to everyone who responded. There are indeed clinics in London, £150 for the swab and certificate ."
Kronick- I was responding to David who is in London. I haven't found anything in Scotland but you can have a postal service-https:/…
What do the rest of you make of this list? Does it mean that people not from these 11 countries will be treated differently on arrival in Kenya (quarantine)? Or not admitted?https:/…
"Unfortunately I believe that is the comprehensive list of countries allowed, currently"
"Kronick; People in Scotland will have to use the postal service for Covid, which means carefully self administering the test, which involves swabbing the back of the throat and the nose, so not very pleasant. Results must be analysed within 48hrs of the test being administered. The drive through centres are for front line staff and other NHS testing facilities will not get you any sort of certificate - you have to go private to get those and as you can see, they're not particularly cheap.Re: flights. These will also resume from the UK, to the best of my knowledge, though with infection rates on the rise again, things could change at the drop of a hat."
cthonrton612 - I received the actual PDF file of the above announcement on Kenya government letterhead this morning. I believe I am going to have to delay my trip or go to Tanzania instead. Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond
"Hi Craig, as of just about an hour ago, KBC and Citizen are reporting that 7 more countries are added, including US and UK. I am hopeful that it is true. Waiting for further information. https:/…"
"It's official! The US is allowed amongst 7 other additional countries, Ministry of Transport has confirmed https:/…"
I had not issues getting into Kenya on Aug 5. All went smoothly. I was not asked for my test results but I had provided a negative test result to the Kenya embassy in Washington DC when they issued my tourist visa on Aug 1.Craig Beal - owner - Travel Beyond
"No need for quarantine for you are coming from England, You just need a Covid -19 negative report within 96 hours from the time of your travel. The communique in tandem classifies requires a traveller to a have negative PCR based COVID–19 test carried out within 96 hours before travel and are from countries considered low to medium risk COVID–19 transmission areas which are exempt from quarantine."
