37 las vegas bars are sueing the govenor over the latest closures... i wonder if they have a chance concidering todays positive cases were a record being more than 1000? Article in the las vegas reveiw....
"“ 37 bars and taverns in Southern Nevada have filed a lawsuit against Gov. Steve Sisolak's recent directive to revert those types of businesses back to Phase 1 of the state's reopening plan and shut down again.The complaint, filed on Sunday, alleges that bars and taverns are being unreasonably singled out and should be treated no differently from other nonessential businesses that are fully compliant with Phase 2 reopening requirements and are allowed to remain open.The lawsuit alleges that the governor forced them to close without regard to recent repots from OSHA and others that demonstrated that the vast majority of bars and all those named in the lawsuit were fully compliant and that there is a “complete absence of evidence” that sitting at a bar top or at a table within the bar area increases the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 as long as the bar or tavern complies with all of the Phase 2 requirements.Article continues...https://www.ktnv.com/news/coronavirus/37-bar…"
They do kind of have a point in that casinos have hundreds if not thousands coming and going yet the small neighborhood bar is being blamed so to speak.It is simply unacceptable that casinos are allowed to keep the number of infected staff hidden.

"This report from the CDC might help their case: ""The case report, published July 14 in the CDC publication Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, focuses on two hairstylists working at a Missouri salon who unknowingly had COVID-19 in May. According to the detailed report, the first stylist worked with clients for eight days while symptomatic, and the second for five. while the second stylist did the same for five days. Over the course of around a week, 139 masked customers visited their salon and got cuts or treatment from them—both of them wearing masks as well. Not a single client or any of the other stylists in the salon became infected as a result. However, 4 persons who lived in the homes of the two stylists, where masks were not worn, all become infected""."
"Bill Grove, you are a doofus. I'd love to see you crying, when you need a hospital bed and there are none left."
Post 5. To me that just adds credence to the governors case. It proves that the masks work. How do you drink at a bar whilst wearing your mask all the time?
I would be curious where the new cases are coming from. I highly doubt they are all from bars. And definitely not from pools. Does he ever report where the cases are being transmitted? Where I live they report on where the clusters are.
“ pools. Does he ever report where the cases are being transmitted? ”How would anyone know?I can see reporting a cluster when there’s a clear connection.Like the dozen or more women who all went to the same bar in Florida and all came down with Covid. But how would you track a cluster when people are going to multiple locations? Even casino employees.

"Population of Nevada is a little over 3 million. Population of New York is 19.5 million. New york has 6.5 times the population of NY. So with Nevada's 1,000 new cases that be an equivalent of New having 6,500 cases. Now NY is under 1,000 cases a day. If we had 6,500 new cases once again all would be shut down. Rightfully so. Why is NY now so low. Easy we followed what we were eventually told to do. Wear a mask."
Ny is low because a huge portion of the population already had it. Have you had a Serology test?

"""Whatever. I really hope they get their rocks off by the end of this year.""Tina? said this."
Big daddy the more you type the more clearly it apparent the math and statistics are not your strong suit either. First we don't close entire countries to prevent cancer. Second 617/3000000 is .00002. You don't just get to throw percent behind the quotient (which is something the nevada state health department chair did when she was explaining Ro was 1.7 PERCENT!). Head slapping eyerolls. But hey math is confusing to most people. When the quotient is .00002 that is .002 percent. To use the word percent (per hundred) you need to multiply by 100. Try dividing 25 cents in a dollar. 25/100 is .25. NOT .25 percent!!! So neither of you understand math and consequently can't understand statistics. So let me just promise you the press on both sides is moving goalposts and lying to you (and me). Only one of us recognizes it. I don't use Facebook or give any credence to the bill gates bs. But the press is lying to you and you're blind to see it and sadly couldn't understand it if you did see it. Unfortunately for all of us. Brought to you by public school teachers and even more forcefully by private liberal arts colleges. We're all f#$d and it isn't because of the covid (which does exist).
"And the press is lying to try to hurt or help Trump. There are just far more outlets trying to hurt. Has anyone looked at johns hopkins serology study or death rate map? Do it.And I can't type on a frikin phone. ( I can't type on a keyboard either) but I can spell and write in proper English.Edited: 7:10 pm, July 15, 2020 "
And DTC I can only watch the word percent misused for so long then I go off.
"617 ÷ 3,000,000 = .0002. Please explain the reason why this would not also equal .0002%Please do the math proof. I want to see what I am doing wrong."
But other Steve kudos for at least looking at the numbers just st be careful when claiming percent.
What's confusing for many people is different denominators.
"Steve. One quarter is 25 percent of a dollar right?25/100 equals .25. .25 IS 25 percent because you need to multiply the answer by 100 to use the word percent. Really though glad you're trying and that is not facetious.Edited: 7:26 pm, July 15, 2020 "
"This has been painful to read through...Steve from Phoenix - to turn any decimal into a percent, move the decimal point two places to the right. You need to make the decimal into hundredths. 0.0002 is 2 ten thousandths. Move the decimal two places to the right and you've got .02 hundredths, or .02%.. Hundredths are equivalent to percentage - number of parts out of 100 possible."
"Steve. Keep up the work. Most po'd at the irony and guile of bigdaddy to accuse you of not understanding statistics while looking right past your error (which is far too common). Usually the liberals get really quiet after I go off and threads ""disappear""."
"Okay, thank you. Anyway, I hope the bar owners prevail in this matter."
Steve in the rain is VERY sensitive when I talk about teacher. He or she is likely a teacher who just googled my lesson to verify it accuracy and then posted self righteously when not really understanding math beyond 3 grade. In fact they probably impressed themselves using decimals on trip advisor.
"Yes, Steve M. 4th grade math really scares us liberals. We all grew up in urban decay and went to failing government schools."
Steve. Reference #36. They point and laugh too then the thread disappears.

"Is the governor's justification for bar closure based on actual case increase tracing from those establishments ( someone, anyone show us the data if you have it)? I'm just guessing, but I'll bet there's very little confirming data if any from Vegas bars..could be wrong and I don't know that any such data would be publicly accessible anyway ( the casinos aren't releasing specific Covid employee / guest data..they aren't required to). These bars are on the status quo ""first to close lists"" among government official options. According to the lawsuit, bars had a very strong Covid compliance record from both OSHA and Clark County business inspectors as compared to other entities. I can provide a link if anybody really wants to read one more line regarding Covid lawsuits.I'm glad these bar owners are making their voice heard on this issue, though the likely judicial outcome, if ever or any ( that's not likely either) will no doubt favor the governor. I'm backing these bar owners on this..I was always kinda entertained by assorted David vs Goliath stories involving individual liberty and economic survival as long as all the participants play by the rules ( equally good or bad ones). This issue has a waft of hypocrisy at it's core ( big box stores and casinos vs independent bars), but that's another topic involving ""essential businesses"" ( don't we all have enough toilet paper now?), real potential Covid transmission variation among business types, human error at all of those, interior confined spaces and potential Covid transmission rates, and money / revenue/ state tax bases ( money talks and the rest walks?).Edited: 10:40 pm, July 15, 2020 "

DTC. Can you tell us what the Johns Hopkins reported case fatality rate is for the county in which you live in the raging inferno that is FL?
FLWfan. Same question to you. What is case fatality rate according to Johns Hopkins for your county in CA?
"Steve M., I haven't been in FL since I came back to MN to watch the college hockey tournament which shortly after I arrived, was cancelled. I stayed in MN."
"Naples florida, Collier county. 1.44 percent. With percent being used correctly. 1.44 percent.0144 in decimalsAnd that is factored in the confirmed cases as of 7/15 (yesterday). Serology report for south Florida on CDC website shows with practically statistical certainty based on number of samples that for every confirmed case there are 11 undiagnosed cases. I won't get into that math. I'll just state one more time. In the south Florida tinderbox, raging inferno case fatality rate in Collier county1.44 percent"
FLWfan. On a recent thread you challenged someone to put up or shut up. Tick tock.
What formula was used to determine the rate?

Nobody screams that...why are you so hyperbolic?
Florida just set a new record for deaths in one day.
Did the death rate go up or down? Because there were a lot of new cases too.Policy decisions need to be made on large demographics not individual sad stories. And they are sad. And you know it or you would demand we close roads to prevent traffic fatalities.
Vista CA. San Diego county. 2.09 percent. 448 deaths. 21446 confirmed cases. I was sure based on FLWfan's comments that 8 or 9 percent were dying like in the travesty that was New York. Nope 2.09 percent. .0209With Serology showing national actual cases 11x confirmed cases.
According to Google Florida has 4520 deaths (up apparently a record one day total of 112) and 302000+ confirmed cases. For a case death rate of. 1.496 percent. .01496. With Serology showing actual cases being 11x higher than confirmed cases in southern florida.

"This thread makes me crazy, then takes a left turn and makes me laugh and hasn’t degraded into polarized politics… thank you all… My thoughts… (going back to the original title…)The governor (here in Nevada or elsewhere) is not destroying bars or better, the business model which are bars… the virus is… The governor(s) didn’t create the virus… There is lots of crossed information about the virus and how it is transmitted and how to stop it… some because we are continuing to learn about the enemy… some because of suggestions early on which were preserving resources for specific populations… (in a world where toilet paper was currency)As we learn about this virus, it appears that bars are a really good environment for transmission… you are drinking so masks are down (note, not debating masks… but damn it wear one)…. Staff may be following all rules including wearing masks, disinfecting surfaces and bathrooms and such… but the guest are not wearing masks (and are not breaking the law) because they are drinking.We tend to be shoulder to shoulder at bars, then one of us pushes in to order a drink… Its by nature bad social distancing… This is why they will let bars who serve food serve you drinks… but not at the bar… they are solving the social distance at bars problem.On statistics… I am a bit of a nerd, and I maintain a couple of spread sheets of covid cases… one for the state of Nevada, one for Boulder City where I work and spend much of my time… I watch total cases only to understand daily cases… (for Boulder City the county only reports total cases… but if you subtract yesterdays cases from todays… bingo) then do 7 and 14 day rolling averages and compare the two… recording bench marks like lock down, releasing lock down, phase 2 and phase 2 roll backs… Assuming significant onset starting at 5 days and majority show by 11 days our current spike correlates to July 4 parties… The CDC and therefor all our governors apparently are tracing any cases to contact at bars… Sisolak is not the only governor closing bars… Randy"

Liberals will warn and hope for the same thing to justify keeping the schools that never opened closed. In the end the statistics will speak for themselves for those who care to understand issues instead of trusting the media that AZ hospitals are overflowing. Maybe the media will rewrite the narritive and claim the us military hospital ships were overflowing in nyc harbor and LA. The fact will be the fact. Trump had looked at the Johns Hopkins fatality rate map and seen the wet fat in a dry suit. Not denying that the disease is real, not discounting the loss of life, but trying to influence policy decisions. Now the crux DTC. If Trump came up with. Miracle national plan and people started to come back to life (which might be the new bench mark) do you really believe CNN would ever ever ever ever give him any credit?They'll keep fanning false flames and headlining one or two deaths with videos of crying children until after the election.

"President Trump made 19,127 false or misleading claims in 1,226 daysIt’s no longer a question as to whether President Trump will exceed 20,000 false or misleading claims by the time his current term is completed. Instead, we have to ask: Will he top 25,000?As of May 29, his 1,226th day in office, Trump had made 19,127 false or misleading claims, according to the Fact Checker’s database that analyzes, categorizes and tracks every suspect statement he has uttered. That’s almost 16 claims a day over the course of his presidency. So far this year, he’s averaging just over 22 claims a day, similar to the pace he set in 2019.With 235 days to go in his current term, that would leave him just short of 25,000. But we have also found that October is a dangerous month for the truth, especially if an election is nearing. In October 2018, the president tallied 1,205 claims and in October 2019, 1,159 claims. That’s a pace of 40 claims a day.Much depends, of course, on whether the president is able to return to holding campaign rallies for his most loyal supporters. At such rallies, the president runs through a list of exaggerated or false claims that easily tops 60 statements a rally. Since the coronavirus pandemic has more or less shut down the United States, the president has been unable to hold such mass events. He tried substituting a daily news conference at the White House, with the occasional interview with a friendly host, but it’s not quite the same thing.The coronavirus pandemic has spawned a whole new genre of Trump’s falsehoods. The category in just a few months has reached 800 claims, with his advocacy for hydroxychloroquine as a possible cure, based on minimal and flimsy evidence, already reaching Bottomless Pinocchio status.It takes at least 20 repeats of a Three- or Four-Pinocchio claim to merit a Bottomless Pinocchio, and there are now 39 entries.Trump’s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker database has recorded more than 450 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times.Article continueshttps:/…"

And we see here the angrier you get, the less likely you are to convince anyone, because you lose the ability to stand your logical ground. And it is always important that posters here mean nothing personal during an argument, even on a forum."
"Btw, Steve..on #83..there is a disconnect."
"DTC stop your guys using the BS liberal follow the science smear. If they actually are posting scientific facts then they can make that claim literally, but to do it as a self righteous scoff..... They had better be able to back it up.I cruise the boards watching for this exact bullsh#+.Edited: 2:19 pm, July 17, 2020 "
"Cruising which boards? Just TA? Or does an algorithm bring you here from... Skopje? Pyongyang? Lagos? East Cupcake?Plenty of arguments over at Infowars, too. Why aren't you there?"
"Ok guys, it's a rap."
"What is so wrong with being liberal? As a liberal myself, I stand for communities and programs that help people. Why do you on the right always forget what liberals pretty much stand for? Always claiming that the gov is too big and we give out too much free stuff ,yet so many of you capitalize on the programs that are put in place because of us liberals. We also believe in true equality and civil liberties .Liberals also supports a role for government in reducing inequality, providing education, ensuring access to healthcare, regulating economic activity and protecting the natural environment. So what's the problem ?It seems to me that most right wing conservatives are hell bent on maintaining and conserving their ""traditions"" which historically has always been at a disadvantage to a certain group(s) of people . Is it because we are for free college education and health care? A Woman's right to choose? equaling out pay gaps based on gender and socio economical status? Or is it because we are about stricter gun laws? Many conservatives I know complain about the cost of programs that help the less fortunate and the disenfranchised because of the high cost of taxes, yet I , a single woman in the 35% tax bracket who claims zero on her taxes feel no pain paying higher taxes so IKaren and Ken can send their screaming privileged brats to school in buses and paved roadways that I contribute to through may taxes. I and most liberals are about the greater good of our country and communities and are not about taking away rights but expanding them to meet everyone's needs . What happens when you have a country that is Healthy and educated ? ProgressEdited: 12:59 pm, July 17, 2020 "
A righteous knight cruising the boards and vanquishing bullsh##ers wherever he finds them.
We need a national face mask mandate.
You meant self righteous
"Birdwalking here. But I heard how Florida is reporting case positivity. An example: 10 people test multiple times. On their last tests, they test positive. So 5 out of those ten have the coronavirus. What Florida reports is a numerator of 5 but instead of 10 as the denominator, they will use 50.."
"angelina1813 - Very well said. That is what a lot of us stand for as liberals or progressives. The vitriol with which a lot of conservatives interact with us demonstrates, I think, the depth of their hatred and the extent to which they've been manipulated. I'm continually surprised by the anger people like Steve M express when they come around ""owning the libs"". He seems to actually think that we don't understand how decimals work (the guy who made the mistake a couple days ago was actually another Trump acolyte), and that he is in possession of some arcane knowledge that we are too simple to grasp.Vote blue, no matter who."
"Kitty gal had post #115 removed. Good for you. Protect that ability to have stupid people smear other people with ""science denier"". Funny. I'll take some whacks it's fine but you guys guess my profession. I'll start- message board ""robot"".Edited: 1:43 pm, July 17, 2020 "
"Uh,nope, I did not. Stop making accusations you can't back up. Do you work for TA? Or in a boiler room?"
"“Always claiming that the gov is too big and we give out too much free stuff ,yet so many of you capitalize on the programs that are put in place because of us liberals.” - Lol, I’ve been waiting for all my free stuff for 45 years. Still haven’t received any because I’ve worked since I was 13 years old and I make too much money for any of those “freebies.” Of course, I’m okay with that because I believe in working hard and not owing anybody anything. Yeah, what a terrible way of thinking I have. Perhaps I should change my tune. 13"
"Guess your profession, Steve!? ..almost as much fun as the Photo Trivia here... Well..I know you never taught English. How 'bout ""mechanic in a candy factory?"" You tighten the nuts on the peanut brittle.Edited: 2:00 pm, July 17, 2020 "
I'll guess Steve works in an abattoir.He only slaughters liberal lambs and refuses to wear a mask.
