Just heard about this. Anyone tried it yet?Its approved by TCI.Home kit you take before a medical professional to swab.https://www.tcisafe.com/https://www.tcisafe.com/pcr-testing
"...""Once collected, keep the swabs at 35ºF (2ºC)"" .... Good luck with that"
Sorry but the best thing now during a pandemic is to stay home
"CanadaSunny, you may be correct for many people, but all these requirements are rather frustrating for people who have had COVID-19, recovered from it, and are, for a time at least, immune from further infection and cannot be contagious. I'd love to head to TCI next week, but for now at least, I have to jump through the same hoops as anyone susceptible to the virus."
"I know someone, will let you know how it goes. So far their primary doc won't administer the test.Edited: 1:48 pm, August 15, 2020 "
I had the most luck having friends that are physicians and doctors associated with a med spa I go to help out. They were all more than willing to help us get tested and fortunately everything came back in time. I’m sure it can’t be too hard to find a helpful doctor. It’s really no one’s place to tell anyone whether to travel or not. There are plenty of ways to do it safely and we can all make our own decisions.
My friend said the doctor didn't know where the test was from or something like that. Nothing to do with symptoms nor not approving travel.
"I called and spoke with a CS rep at NLC. He said it can be a doctor, nurse or pharmacist. I asked if I could be swabbed from a nurse or doctor I know in my neighborhood and he said yes. For what its worth...And the cost is $130Edited: 3:55 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"So it appears there is no paperwork to show who has actually done the swab, so basically anyone can swab. This just gets better and better."
"If what the OP thru #10 have posted is true, and you add in the Positive Case spike at the 2 week after opening mark, do you need any more ""evidence"" that the ""unknown"" COVID cases are Not only coming from local-to-local transmission of virus that existed on the island before July 22nd?Staying Home is Safest!"
"There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.Apr 24, 2020"
"This test on the site is really brand new has not been available since July 22nd. In fact up until this particular test, at home testing was not allowed. Which this is not meant to be an at home test.Edited: 5:57 pm, August 15, 2020 "
