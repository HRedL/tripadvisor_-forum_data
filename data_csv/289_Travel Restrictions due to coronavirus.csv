"OK...so my boyfriend and I booked a trip to Sicily for April 9th- April 15th. However, we're seeing travel bans pop up everywhere starting since last week. We called the airline to see about refunds due to health restrictions. We would get our money back (full refund) if the airline cancels us. However, if we take the precaution and cancel we'll lose $600. How are things in Sicily as of today (02/24/20)? I know Italy is taking precautions and implementing travel bans as recently as last week, If we cancel our trip we would have to skip out on our European dream location and look for a alternative (St.Lucia maybe) . I'm so bummed out about this"
Sicily is an island and not anywhere near the northern region of the mainland currently affected. Here's the US Embassy link:https:/…
"If this were my trip to Sicily, I would go, since AT THE MOMENT there are absolutely no travel restrictions or advisories for Sicily, and all museums and churches are open as normal.Moreover, you still have well over one month before your trip starting date, during which time much is likely to change (perhaps for the better)."
"We have a layover in Frankfurt, that's where the big concern comes into play. Would we be allowed back in the US without having to be quarantined? With Sicily being an island and Italy so close the threat of it spreading is scary. News reports here are showing this isnt a small issue."

"Right now CDC says this about Italy: ""CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to the following destinations. Travelers should practice usual precautions."" I would just watch the website to see if it changes."
"I just posted on another thread, but here is an idea. You can wait until very last minute to cancel airline tix. You ei"
"Many of us are in your situation. Extensive discussion of this subject is found in the Italy forum, rather than the Sicily forum.https:/…ShowForum-g187768-i20-Italy.htmlSee alsohttps:/…105693951"
"@Koala_Bear77, All I can say is as things stand there are no issues with the virus around Frankfurt or Sicily. Just keep an eye on the situation from day to day by checking through reputable sources.Edited: 5:00 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"So we decided to cancel our trip the risks outweigh everything (for us). So we're just going to book another trip somewhere else for that week. We'll visit Sicily once things settle down...I'm bummed out because, we've been planning this trip for over 8 months, but again the risk outweighs personal enjoyment at this point. https:/…"
I think you should not go if you feel uncomfortable. matter of fact I hope more people cancel. i's getting much too crowded anyway. stay safe. stay home.
"By April things could be very different, much better, or much worse. If worse, there will be cases everywhere, and nothing particularly risky about Italy. Did you miss that there are cases in the US already?Your biggest risk is being in a plane for an extended period with people who have travelled from all over. You’ll be no safer flying to St Lucia."
"From the CDChttps:/…coronavirus-italyEdit. Ah..I see you cancelled your trip...well above link may be helpful for others.Edited: 1:33 pm, February 25, 2020 "
I'm more concerned about getting stuck somewhere & not being able to get back home .Or being stuck in quarantine in a foreign country. We're just going to wait it out and plan another trip at another time. It's a scary time to travel
Still think I'm causing hysteria & the virus wont reach Sicily because Italy is 1500km away ?
"Hi Koala_Bear77,You made the correct decision since you felt so uncomfortable, and yes some of the comments on this thread were unrealistic given the origins and spread of this virus.But there are cases in the US, and apparently not too distant in New York, but then your case in point about being home and not quarantined in a foreign country.https:/…Hopefully you'll enjoy your holiday somewhere else, and visit Sicily when it feels right for you.Vagabonda"
"I just wanted info & I felt like certain people thought I was being drama queen. This is serious and people need to wake up if they think this is like the flu. Getting stuck in a foreign country is on a whole different level of scary. We are going to visit Sicily one day in the near future but, when it's safer. Honestly who would really enjoy vacation at this point under these unknown conditions. I probably would have a heart attack just flying in a plane whether international or domestic at this point."
"A very calm and kind response from Vagabonda. Koala you've made the decision you feel is right for you and that's all any of us can do. St Lucia has announced they will be banning holidaymakers who have recently visited Italy, along with other bans like China and Hong Kong. The problem is that the virus has spread to all but one of the world's continents. Visitors are travelling all the time from those places, completely unaware they may be incubating the virus. For me, the worry is not contracting Covid 19. We're pretty healthy and not elderly. No - the worry is being stuck somewhere like the hotel full of people in Tenerife currently confined to their rooms. We have work and commitments at home. We hope to be in Sicily in April unless the UK Government issues a travel warning."
"and for some of us its not so simple. we cant use travel insurance to cancel unless our govt declares it no travel. We have been planning a two month trip of Europe for a year. we leave next month. We have prepaid all airfares, accommdodation, tours etc. Its too expensive for us to cancel and lose our savings. But Italy is where we are spending the bulk of our time and we dont want to be quarantined in a country where we dont speak the language, dont know anyone or arent familiar with hospitals. But we cant cancel unless airlines cancel or country closes its boarders. Not a good position to be in from the bottom of the world"
"#25We are in a similar situation, bookings September-November.I console myself at 76 with the thought that on the planet most people my age are dead. I also tell myself that if we lose from cancellations (not all) then we won't be spending the quite large extra amount we would spend if travel. I also have concern, empathy, for those whose livelihoods are at jeopardy from many cancellations, the nice apartment hosts and hotel staff, the transport workers, the airline staff (1200 laid off already, weeks ago, by Qatar)... We may have to content ourselves with visiting Hobart (family matriarch, last week) and New Zealand (youngest daughter, husband and baby, May). Having had chronic illness for a long time I'm sharply aware of living with a tiny window to see the passing world. I can't afford to howl against the night."
"Hi Vagabonda and other readers, we have a flight booked to Catania for tomorrow. We will stay one week, hotels booked in Agrimento, Noto and Siracusa. We are considering whether to go or not. I read that in Palermo pretty much is closed down, at least until Monday March 2nd, and saw pictures of empty shelves, and people wearing face masks. Does anybody know how restricted daily life in the rest of Sicily is, especially in the places where we will be staying? My other (and biggest) worry is that Sicily will become a high risk area, I hope for all the people of Sicily it will not!"
"Hi. I can give you a few hints about the real current situation in Palermo now. Don't trust the media hype so much at moment.Yes, schools and university will stay closed until March 2. My sister is a teacher at school, and said that the official reason given for this is to sanitize the buildings. No children or teachers actually involved. Post offices, restaurants and bars, shops and other public services are open as usual.I go to different supermarkets to buy a few daily things almost everyday, including this morning and, in central Palermo I haven't noticed anything strange happening, no queues or crowds, or empty shelves. Some friends of mine told me that there were problems with crowds and missing products is some bigger shopping malls in the outskirts of the city, but really nothing special in more central areas.The face mask thing is the most strange, because almost nobody is wearing them here at moment. But I was curious, and started to pay attention counting them since Sunday. Until now, I have counted just nine (9) people wearing it everywhere I went in the city, since last Sunday. One was a police agent, and 3 of them were foreign tourists.This is the current situation in Palermo until today, nothing more, nothing less. Perhaps the most noticeable thing is that the number of tourists strolling around the centre is less than the usual, and this is visible...Edited: 1:47 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"This situation is just so sad, I feel bad for everyone involved. We've been planning this trip since August, saved up our money so we could stay at our dream hotel (Hotel Villa Sonia in Castelmola), but being stuck is not worth it. We have two children, jobs, bills, & commitments here and a mandatory quarantine would throw everything off. #25 I feel your pain we didnt have travel insurance either so we lost $600 bucks on flights. We were going to try to wait it out and see if the airlines would cancel but, we decided to do something domestically in place of Sicily for that week. I'm so bummed out but safety and welfare are more important at this point."
"I & my wife are scheduled to fly to Europe on March 10th. We plan to visit Switzerland, Austria & Italy. We've been looking forward to this 3-week trip. We are not sure if we'll again have this much free time in the Spring. I'm not too worried about getting infected by the CV; the risk is low. But it would be devastating to be stuck somewhere in a foreign country due to a mandatory quarantine. This whole CV thing makes me angry!"
"Hi Biondo, thank you so much for your hints about the real current situation in Palermo, it is very helpful."
"Prego EVT traveller. If you will need more updates about the real situation in Palermo, just ask."
I'd like to add to this thread that Israel announced that it would not accept non-Israeli travelers coming from italy because of the coronavirus. I am not sure but they might also refuse entry to the country if you were in Italy as part of an overall trip. https:/…us-china-health-israel-idUSKCN20L1H9
"#33In an interview on Italian television today, a leading Italian virologist commented that Israel's decision to bar non-Israeli travelers coming from Italy, from entering Israel on account of the Coronavirus situation, was a purely POLITICAL decision, reached notwithstanding strong opposition from Israeli virologists. Nevertheless, the decision is very unfortunate and does not improve the media coverage for Italy."
"Hi! We too are travelling to Italy soon, in May in fact for one month , starting in Venice , then to Rome and Sicily . Have had it planned and booked for 12 months. Currently we will not be changing our travel plans as things are forever changing . One thing we have put a halt on is our internal travel plans , for example where we will be exactly between flying into Venice and out of Rome . Yes we could cancel and book elsewhere but be in the exact same situation by next week . So for us it’s still a wait and see. We are concerned yes believe me , like you not about contracting the virus but more of being quarantined somewhere . There is so much misinformation and hysteria it’s crazy . If only we had a crystal ball to foresee the future . Good luck with your travel plans wherever you may end up. It’s a crappy situation to be in ! All the best ."
"To be honest, if I knew I was going to get this virus, I might get on a plane to Italy, which I think might be a better place than New York City to have this illness.. If I was suspected of having it here I would likely be sent to the isolation ward of a large public hospital where I wouldn't otherwise seek treatment. For a couple days docs would argue with the CDC over whether I could have coronavirus test. After 3 or 4 days they might consent, then I would be tested and wait for results, which would probably be another 3 or 4 days. On the other hand, if I went to Italy, I could check into a nice hotel. If I wasn't feeling well and thought I might have this virus there would be a special phone number I could call. They would likely send someone out to take a sample for the test. They would do that in my hotel room. I would have the test results within hours.If I needed hospitalization, I would be hospitalized (likely whether I needed it or not, as they would probably want me out of that hotel). But otherwise, if I were say in my own home, they would leave me there, treat me there, and see I had what I needed."
"We finally canceled our trip to Sicily March 15-26. We used miles on United to fly into and out of Milan with an Easy Jet ticket to Palermo. We will lose some money on our HomeAway stays. I think everyone needs to make their own decisions. For us we feel we can see Sicily another time, since we have already waited 62 years! We don’t want to be somewhere where restaurants may be limited and people are walking around with masks! We also dont want to risk any type of quarantine whether we agreed with it or not, it could happen. We have a few family members in various stages of pregnancy here at home and the chance that we could carry this back to them made us nervous. True, we all may get it, or none of us, but that’s our logic. Do what works for your piece of mind!"
Even I am going to Catania in March I'm from Malta and I dont know what I'm going to do
"We have tickets for March 11-25 and planned to spend most of the time in Sicily. The tickets are basic economy and we didn't get insurance. Like QQ2, I figured that I'd rather get the virus, if I was going to get it, in Italy where they know what they're dealing with and how to deal with it. We are flying in & out of Rome, and had planned to visit there a few days at the end of our trip, but now our current unscientific thinking is that we'd be better off just having our last day before flight out in Rome since Sicily is probably ""safer."" My actual fear in all this is that someone might decide to tweet in the middle of the night and we'll end up quarantined on our return to the US.Right now, since I'll lose money anyway, I'm in a wait and see mode.I also just wanted to add that I appreciate everyone's thoughts in this forum during this trying time."
"Whatever the basis of Israel's decision not to permit travelers from Italy into Israel, the net result is that you can't go to Israel from Italy. It's important for people planning trips to know that these kinds of decisions are made without warning. One of the difficulties travelers now face is many sudden decisions airlines are making because of the coronavirus. British Airways has significantly reduced the number of flights it normally makes to Italy, not because of contagion, but because so many people have cancelled bookings, and few are buying tickets to Italy, it makes no sense to fly the planes empty. BA has not completely stopped flying to Northern Italy, and if you had bought tickets for a particular flight, you surely would have been put on the next flight. But if you are planning an entire trip that involves hotel reservations or business meetings, or catching a train after you get off a plane, you need to be aware that right now, in Europe, many sudden decisions are being taken because of the coronavirus outbreak, by governments and airlines and famous tourist sites. You could find yourself making many adjustments in the middle of your travel.Edited: 12:26 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Good luck, Baltoellen, and enjoy your trip! If you haven't done so already you might want to check out the US Dept of State country info page for Italy and sign up for STEP notifications from US Embassy Rome."
"QQ2: Yes, get the STEP notifications from the US Embassy in Rome and sad to see that as of this evening Italy is at level 3. After reading this: ""There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas."" I feel much less cavalier about going and would feel awful using medical resources needed for the Italian population.My fingers are crossed that things get better for everyone very soon."
I would not travel if I were you. I have all my family there and they told me to stay put. Nobody is allowed to leave the house there are police checks everywhere and although the virus cases are low you would not be able to have a holiday. Try and change your ticket. Mine has not been cancelled either I am just waiting as at present Sicily has issued a travel ban for all flights except two national ones. I am confident flights will be cancelled as in two weeks nothing will change.
"May be it will be useful, there is good site where you can check current travel restrictions of every country imposed for prevent of spread COVID-19: https://restrictions.info/ . It seems, now it's a most complete and actual database of COVID-19 travel restrictions."
"Obviously this thread was posted long before the restrictions, but it's not even possible to travel now, and there's no indication when travel will resume.https:/…106348424Vagabonda"
