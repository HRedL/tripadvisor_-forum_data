Are you still allowed to visit Australia even as a US citizen even if it requires a 2 week quarantine? Will your hotel be paid for? How have the hotel reviews been? Also what airlines are available bc I heard currently only United is available.
No. No. Not applicable. Good. Not relavent.
"NO. Our borders are closed to non-Aussies. If they were open, why would we pay for your quarantine?"
"Um, not sure about you but 2weeks spent in a hotel room, without being allowed to leave the room, is not the best use of holiday leave.Besides that, everything is closed."
"And given the situation in the US, when our borders do reopen, I suspect it will be a limited reopening and that they will remain closed to Americans for a while yet.Edited: 1:12 am, April 21, 2020 "
"Great 1st post & question, Sha.Ask again this time next year"
"Hotel quarantine ... no matter how many stars ... No room service, no one makes the bed or cleans the room, no one comes in and cleans your toilet and fold your toilet paper in a lovely point, three meals a day a dropped outside your door, there are two choices, if there is no balcony you can't go outside, if the windows don't open they don't open, you stay in that room for 14 days solid ... no exits at all. That's what it's like ... some people got the Four Seasons ... some people got an Ibis basic."
Has to be a poor attempt at a joke. Can’t possibly be a serious post.
That's classic Luigi. Nice finding.
Good try. troll.
How funny!

Fantastic Luigi!
I’m not trying to troll. I really was wanting to check with information I heard and wanted to be sure I understood it right.
So what are you trying to do?
And did you notice that review has two helpful votes already??!!
"At this stage, i really don't think you're going to get much advice other than ""stay in the USA""."
"To break it down simply for you if you hate in fact serious about attempt g to travel in the middle of a worldwide pandemic1. No, you cannot fly to Australia. Our borders are currently closed to non citizens. 2. All citizens returning to Australia are required to isolate at a hotel for 2 weeks. They do not have a choice where. It is currently paid for by the government but will no doubt change to self funded after a period as everyone should have made their way home by now, they’ve had enough notice. 3. Everything here is shut anyway and there is nothing to do tourist wise. 4. We can only leave our homes for essential shopping, medical appointments, local exercise and caregiving requirements. 5. STAY HOME! Now is not the time to be traveling ANYWHERE"

"No, it’s always been one mandatory quarantine directive since it took effect midnight 28th March. The exemption clause was added 4th April, and it has always included Compassionate and Medical Grounds since it’s first publicationThere have been dozens given the exemptions by the police with medical approval - it just simply hasn’t been covered in the media because it doesn’t sell - compared to celebrities who complain about jail like conditions in the hotelsEdited: 6:25 am, April 23, 2020 "
/KVE1005 thank you for clearing that up
"I apologise in advance for this very long post, killing im time and frustration.This is my 12th day of quarantine in Sydney after returning to Australia from New Zealand, where the whole country has been in total lock down level 4 for 5 weeks. I just want to say to those people that make nasty comments about people travelling , Some Australians like myself are oversea for various reasons, and in my case reasons out of my control . Do i agree , all travellers coming back to Australia from oversea should be forced to isolate ? Most definitely ! However i wanted to share my experience with you, and how overwhelming it has been . 23th May i arrived into Sydney , I made my way through the airport, everything was shut , no duty free stores cafes etc, i was greeted by nurses and my temperature was checked, i than was escorted by the army and police and put on a bus. A passenger had ask the driver where are they taking us, no reply , it be a secret i thought We arrived at the SOFITEL DARLING HARBOUR . When i got off the bus i was overwhelmed with emotion and anxiety as i could see the fixed glass windows and there was no balconies, as i walked into the hotel i had a panic attack. When i finally calmed down i was taken to my room. The room was not as small as i expected , at least i had a lounge i thought, i wouldnt have to sit on the bed for 14days. The nurse called shortly afterwards to check on me as i told her when when i had the panic attack that i am also a smoker and have an anxiety condition that is mostly triggered when i fill trapped closed in . She said i can purchase some patches to get me through but the doctor can not prescribe medication whilst in isolation .Food situation, food is disgusting truly . I thought ok whatever , i can order some food from coles , woolies it will be ok , than i looked around the room , there is no toaster or microwave . There was a kettle thank God , i thought i could at least make a coffee in the morning .I looked around the room for the fridge and found it in the bathroom , i opened the fridge door and could feel that it wasn't cold . I though ok, maybe i need to adjust the temp, i called reception to see what temperature the fridge needs to be set . I was than told ,"" sorry that is not a fridge"" , what ! , it looks like a fridge , what is it ? ""it is a special eco friendly icebox , it works like an esky "" chiller is what the kiwis call it . Apparently it only keeps things cool for a short time if they are already cold when put in. So i ordered my milk and fruit and items that i thought would last a couple of days from and got my delivery the next day. It got very expensive paying 15 dollars delivery fee for milk i can tell you , but it was worth it as i could have coffee and tea. ay 12 , everyone is tested for Corona, that's another experience i hope i never , ever have to go through again. Ask anyone that has been tested and they will tell you its not nice. I had another melt down that night and cried hysterically on the phone to my husband, it was day 12 , no smoking no fresh air feeling like i have just been eating rubbish the while time , dying for a simple home cooked meal , fresh vegies and a proper latte ...Anyway one more day and one more night and i will be able to put this all behind me , i am so excited i can not wait , i am really excited to go home, but at the sametime im really scared being around a lot of people , it seems from looking out my fixed windows everyday , everyone seems to be going about their business like nothing is wrong, and there is no pandemic out there. I can tell you if you have been as careful as i have, isolating in lock down level 4 for 5 weeks and than 2 weeks in total isolation you too would think twice about being relaxed with it all as I would not want it to be all in vain ."
Really disappointing to hear of the Oz Embassy’s incompetence. I hope you contact your local MP to let govt know. IME it’s worthwhile to do so.
"I must say very bad form by the Embassy to use group email. !! I bet that person will get kick up the backside.However back to quarantine .The latest Covid 19 case in Canberra is with a Diplomat returning to Australia , he did not have to use the Hotel Quarantine. So this might need some more review. It shows how important it is Good Luck"
"Yes I agree re quarantine. I think Australians resident here feel very attached to our quarantine arrangements and will be very unwilling to part with them. Not only are there questions around whether infection provides immunity, but can the test you’ve had be relied on. Here there are often revisions of false positives.My comment re contacting your local MP re DFAT referred to the group email. That is unacceptable under any circumstances. Agree with Luigi that charter flights being expensive is not automatically the Australian taxpayer’s problem. And presumably the Oz govt is having the same problems as others in securing aircraft, landing rights etc to make the journey home reliable.I still wonder about the stream of Australians returning. It was becoming obvious well before the end of March (the Diamond Princess in Tokyo was early March) that things were becoming problematic. I get it if people are living o/s ( but then why return to Oz), but it’s hard to be sympathetic towards people that went off on a holiday, like the Aurora cruise ( CRUISE!!!!!) to Antarctica In mid-late March. I think the govt is actually being pretty generous in providing fee free quarantine for those who left for leisure in the weeks during which they were strongly advising against travel."
Neal was there a reason you waited 9 days after our borders were shut and 2 weeks after overseas travelers were advised to return home to decide to travel?
"""Neal was there a reason you waited 9 days after our borders were shut and 2 weeks after overseas travelers were advised to return home to decide to travel?""This is exactly my question.I was in Croatia, and coincidentally was due to fly back on 29th of March. I realised on 13th of March that I needed to make way back asap. I flew back on 18th of March. I would have flown back on 14th or 15th, but had something I had to do before I left Croatia. IMO some people didn't take the pandemic seriously at first and then when things got serious, expected the government to fetch them. I am not saying that was the case with Neal."
"I am sure there are many Australians currently overseas, like me, who left Australia BEFORE the pandemic and stayed through lockdown where they were.I left Australia at the end of last year with the intention of living in a remote village in Tuscany, Italy, for 6 months. When the PM issued his media release urging Australians ""travelling"" to come home he said the risk for them was from stations, airports and places where people congregate. I was not and have not been a traveller on this trip, and in fact I have not left my village (which has suffered no COVID deaths) for 5 months. To answer the question posed at #36, in respect of my circumstances I consulted with the Australian Embassy in Rome and it was agreed it would in fact have been far riskier for me to leave my village and travel back to Australia. This was because to go back when the call was made would involve, for me, a 50km bus trip, then a walk to a train station, then a train to Rome, then another train or bus to the airport, then a flight to London, then a flight a Singapore, then a flight to Sydney. It would have also involved me getting a permit to leave the village and travel to Rome because at that time we were in total lockdown and not allowed outside our homes for any reason except getting medical attention and buying food. The police were patrolling the streets and in some places, such as Padua further north they were inspecting the bags of shoppers as they left the store and issuing on-the-spot fines to anyone with only one or two items in their bags.Our total lockdown was imposed on 8 March and was in place for 10 full weeks. On the first morning, my daughter, SIL, and youngest son were in Florence and about get into a hire car and come to stay with me for a few days. Instead, they had to catch a train to Rome and fly out that day. My daughter and SIL ended up on the second last Qantas flight leaving London. My son ended up in lockdown in Barcelona but did not go back to school in Denmark but instead arrived back in Sydney a few hours before quarantine was imposed in incoming travellers. All other family and friends' planned visits to my village were cancelled, including my wife, who I have not seen for 5 months and who is not allowed to leave Australia to visit me despite Italy's borders now being re-open and quarantine removed.Each Australian living overseas, such as me, would have gone through the same process of trying to determine the best course of action leading up to Australia closing its border. Panic and take flight? Or settle down and ride it out? It was a risk assessment based on personal circumstances. Any suggestion Australians living overseas should have responded to the media's misreporting of what the PM advised by immediately trying to find a way home is idiotic.Now that my 6-month visa free period in Italy is nearing an end, the Embassy has passed on to me the Italian Government's request that I leave Italy ""as soon as feasible"" after the 6 months, so now it is not a matter of choice. My original flight home leaving Rome on 19 June was cancelled. This was a Qantas flight operated by Emirates. I had that flight transferred to the first flight after Emirates planned for July, departing Rome on 1 July, then departing Dubai early on 2 July. Now Emirates have cancelled their 1 July flight. For some reason I was automatically given a ticket to fly from Dubai to Sydney on 3 July, but now I have to get onto Qantas again to get my 1 July flight from Rome transferred to 2 July. I daresay there will be other Australians on that 3 July flight from Dubai returning home.At no time have I expected a rescue flight or similar from the Australian Government.Edited: 2:12 am, June 09, 2020 "
So you were posting messages about the bushfires and so on earlier this year from Tuscany? That's admirable dedication
"""Any suggestion Australians living overseas should have responded to the media's misreporting of what the PM advised by immediately trying to find a way home is idiotic.""I didn't rely on media. I was in constant contact with my family here and relied on them for more accurate information."
"We left our home on Christmas Day and had spent the previous 2 days getting our 100-yr old farmhouse in North Katoomba as fire ready as possible. I spent an entire day just clearing out the gutters. We packed our valuables at the same time as packing for the trip. Those last few days the air was thick with smoke and ash and burnt leaves were falling, and the Grose Valley fire was headed our way. Evacuation was on the cards, so evacuating to Europe just seemed an extension of that. Every day for the next 3 weeks before my wife flew back home (to a safe home) we would check the Fires Near Us website, the weather, and other sources including the neighbours so yeh, I had a handle on the situation. I also kept up to date on the Leura railway landslide courtesy of contacts at Transport NSW and my wife, who commutes, and on other happenings. For example my wife sent me video footage of the landslide at Leura Cascades which closed Cliff Drive. It's pretty easy keeping up to date so long as you know the places that are being talked about, and I do. Another example has been the open/closed situation involving Jenolan and access to it. I know the detour to get in the back way very well and in fact drove it several times only last Nov/Dec. I also know first hand most of the tracks that have been affected by landslides, rockslides, floods and fire since December."
"""Any suggestion Australians living overseas should have responded to the media's misreporting of what the PM advised by immediately trying to find a way home is idiotic.""EDIT: ""Any suggestion by Australians IN Australia, the whole time, that all Australians living overseas should have responded to the media's misreporting of what the PM advised by immediately trying to find a way home is naïve at best and idiotic at worst."""
Peter I asked a question of Neal to gather more information. If he is an Australian living overseas then I see it as a different situation than a tourist on a limited holiday plan. If your case I think it was perfectly sensible to shelter in place as you were planning on being there for months at a time. But as you also stated you’re not expecting a mercy flight home to be arranged for you.
"Yeh, I get that."
"Hi LOstris, yes there was a reason why we couldn’t get back in March before the borders closed. Travel was normal and then suddenly it wasn’t. Egypt closed its borders and stopped international flights with under 24 hours notice, suddenly the outbound flights were packed in the scramble. Not that we knew it as “The Dragon Storm” meant we had no power for 4 days so no phone, tv or internet (the storm killed 20 people and the roads were blocked by flooding, still had a flooded highway near us for over a week). Then the airport was closed and Etihad had suspended flights. Charter flights are not cheap, minimum triple the airfare of normal flights. I would have taken one in April to get back to work ( my wife and son would then stay here until flights resume) but I naively thought Etihad wouldn’t cancel our replacement flight of the beginning of May. Plus the risk of being stranded mid journey is very high ( over half of the charters get cancelled) and the transit hubs can be very expensive if they make you stay in a hotel or can be very unpleasant places to be stranded (I’ve been stuck before at airports in dumps where the airport has no decent toilets and it was easy to walk into and out of the airport without any checks).Also from reports I’ve read about many charter flights the odds are you don’t get a refund if the flight is cancelled. For the cost of a single charter flight ticket the 3 of us have lived here for 3 months (we own an apartment) so I’d rather save the money to live comfortably here than blow it on the gamble of a charter flight. My biggest cost is the time off work so we have no income but still have expenses in Australia."
"Wow Peter, what else can happen this year ???"
And now it looks like quarantine may have to be self funded....https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/nati…
A deterrent to what? A deterrent to people returning to Australia?It also seems strange that international airports and border control is a federal matter but the quarantine of international travellers is being done by the states. Considering that the government gouges many millions out of us on the costs of passports and airport departure levies then they can put some of that back for the costs the government makes in requiring quarantine.
"Neal, there is good reasons for the State and Territories to run this. They control their own Health Departments and Hospitals, they appoint the Police.Add to this the money they get from the Grants Commission every year , and the billions the Federal Government is shoveling to the States Currently.Good Luck"
"Simple, if you want to complain about the costs of travel- dont travel. If you break down the costs o pf a passport over 10 years, its the price of a few cups of coffee each year. How else do we afford to fund immigration and customs forces to protect our borders and laws. The free ride needs to end at some point."
"""Considering that the government gouges many millions out of us on the costs of passports and airport departure levies then they can put some of that back for the costs the government makes in requiring quarantine.""Come on. The money they make on those things are for costs associated with those things, not for putting up people into hotels."
"I'm not sure why imposing quarantine fees would be seen as a deterrent, other than a deterrent from coming home until quarantine is lifted. Which doesn't make sense to me because, as with Australia, other countries have time limits on visas for visitors and time limits for non-visa stays. In my case the issue of quarantine once I land back in Sydney is irrelevant to my decision as to when or if I return home, whoever is bearing the cost. Once my visa-free 6 months stay in Italy ends I am obliged to leave the country as soon as it is feasible to do so. Period.As for the cost to the state governments of paying for quarantine, it is decreasing each week and relative to other costs being borne by the taxpayer in response to COVID-19, is overall a mere drop in the ocean of public spending. I'm ok with a fee and understand that perhaps a choice of hotel is not feasible due to the involvement of federal resources in enforcing it."
"Being forced into quarantine isn’t “a free ride”. It isn’t something that I want or need. It is something that the government wants and is an overreaction to something that is really just another flu. Most of the deaths ( over 98%) are people with comorbidities and most are elderly with perhaps half in nursing homes. Before this virus 4% of nursing home patients died each week and the common flu strains kill around 5000 each year in Australia. The lockdowns will cause more deaths than the virus what with people not getting timely medical treatment, the rise in suicides due to loss of jobs and loss of social contact ( like the guy who commutes suicide when locked in a Melbourne quarantine hotel).As it is I have not worked now for 3 months and when I get back I will be eligible for the dole as I can’t work when locked up in the quarantine (plus the job I had vanished when it was forced to shut down). So what can the government do if we refuse to pay for the quarantine that they want?"
"Gosh Neal, didn’t realise we had a medical expert here in your good self. I would have thought you’d easily find a job when you get back to Australia and out of quarantine.Going by your comparison with regular flu, I had no idea that more than 400,000 people died from regular flu annually. Who knew?"
"""It also seems strange that international airports and border control is a federal matter but the quarantine of international travellers is being done by the states.""If that was true then it would be strange. But it isn't true. Quarantining is managed by the ABF and the AFP.""Considering that the government gouges many millions out of us on the costs of passports and airport departure levies then they can put some of that back for the costs the government makes in requiring quarantine.""Gouges? Are you serious? You pay $298 for a passport that is valid for 10 years and is replete with sophisticated technology designed to protect your identity. Compared to the cost of an annual driver's licence every year for 10 years I'd say that's a small price to pay for probably the single most important document you will ever have the privilege of holding. And the airport departure levies? There is only one charge - the PMC. It applies to all departing travellers, including non-citizens, and is the same kind of fee that many other countries charge, NZ being notable exception, so don't feel the Government is targeting you. And at $60, yeh that's some serious gouging going on. Not."
"Yorkfoodie, yes, I actually am a medical expert of sorts, spent 11 years after college in biological (animal) research with the CSIRO, probably read 10,000 extracts then and probably a similar number since (I left the research field 25 years ago but still spend 20+ hours/week reading an eclectic range of articles). Yes, more people have died from the common flu this year than have died from this bug. It’s nasty but not any worse than say the flu outbreaks of 1968 or 1957 and we didn’t shut down the worlds economy then.It isn’t this bug that is messing things up but the overreaction of people and governments that will cost money and lives.The inconvenience to me is minor, we own a nice flat here and am enjoying ourselves plus I’ll have work when I get out of quarantine but many people won’t ( my qualifications make it that I have to turn down job offers but many of my former coworkers are probably now unemployed as it isn’t easy to find work without a range of qualifications). In the city I’m in (Cairo) there are now an extra million unemployed and the government handouts are only given to a portion of them and it is only $45/month.As for Australian fees and charges for passports and airports they are double what most countries charge. The chip and whatnot in the passport doesn’t protect me against identity theft if the embassy gives out people’s contact details (like the Australian embassy here did), so that is a feature that is a waste of money.When I left Australia there was no restrictions and the number infected on this continent of 1.2 billion was less than 20, even now there are only a few million infected so perhaps 1 in 500. Frankly I have more chance of catching a hundred other diseases that wouldn’t be detected by the 14 day quarantine but people fixate on this particular bug. Madness."
"BTW Yorkfoodie, I’m surprised that you didn’t know that the annual flu death toll was more than 400,000. There are multiple publications that cover the subject. Might I recommend John Pagets research paper from 2019 if you want to know more.Also I’m not sure where you got the 400,000 figure from, flu deaths are higher than that of course and this new bug has killed far less than that (400,000 dying with the virus is not the same as 400,000 dying from the virus)."
"Neal, you raise a very good question, about what the Government can do to recover the Quarantine costs.As you are such a smart person and I also worked for CSIRO , I thought that you might have a understanding on how Governments work. The Federal Government have great powers to recover funds.So if you get a job , they can instruct your employer to take a payment from your wages and remit.If you get a benefit from the Government they can deduct from there They can also hold the debt, and impose interests, they can keep doing this till the end. So this could get sorted on your 'Final"" Tax Return. The executor of your will is required to pay the ATO as the first creditor.So Good Luck and stay safe"

"Interestingly, the four hospitals we had quickly built in the UK at the start of lockdown, to cope with the extra burden on the NHS, have hardly been used. At one time there were about 21 people in the Nightingale Unit in London out of 4000 beds and one of the emergency overflow units had so few patients it has been closed.Even with over 41,000 people dying from Covid and the thousands of ill people, it has not made as big an impact on the capacity of our hospitals as was expected."
GW I know what you are saying. But IMO we DID overreact around ICU beds -especially her is SA where we never had more than 4 cases in ICU.
"The virus began here in February (with the first recorded cases coming from Italy where they had been skiing) but winter is our peak time for colds and (normal) flu. I expect many people here assumed they had a cold/flu and did nothing more than take paracetamol (as is advised) at first, until they became much worse at the beginning of the pandemic.Both of us were ill after Christmas, my OH wasn't that bad but went on for a couple of weeks, mine was later and worse, but only lasted three days. Neither of us at the time were at all concerned as the news about the virus didn't come until later. Now it transpires that it is believed the virus had been around longer than first thought.We few back from Australia in early December and transited through Bangkok, and it has been thought the virus originated in Thailand. For all we know, we might have both picked it up there! Or maybe it was just a bug. We though nothing of it at the time.Agree that many didn't act quickly when they showed symptoms so the virus took hold when it could perhaps have been treated. Yes, we have much denser population than Australia and more people are nearer major hospitals than in Australia.I think those factors made it worse in the UK and the fact we didn't shut our borders and didn't instigate quarantine from the start and then we have an inept government!"
"The other thing Neal ignores when quoting statistics is that the total of deaths from Covid-19 so far may be close to the number of deaths from regular flu, but this total has been reached in a few months as opposed to a full year, under conditions that in many countries would limit the number of cases of Covid-19 in the first place, so a thinking person would have to conclude that Covid-19 is rather deadlier than regular flu."
"Also, I wonder what the death toll from the virus would have been if restrictions and lockdown weren't implemented?"
">>>Interestingly the all cause death statistics from the US are showing that even with this virus fewer people are dying each week than last year.<<<https:/…dashboardUm - no, they are not. During the worst weeks of the pandemic nearly 40% more people were dying in the US."
"Clearly this is an instance where a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. CDC numbers for flu deaths in the most recent season in the US are about 34,000. In a year. So far Covid deaths are in excess of 115,000 in a few months. That’s more than three times as many deaths in less than half the time. I really don’t know how anyone can conclude that countries that want to limit Covid as much as possible are just being worry warts.And now they are finding that many of the younger folk who recover from Covid turn out to have permanent medical issues as a result."
