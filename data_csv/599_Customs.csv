How is Customs handling COVID-19 distancing? Last time I was there the lines were up to an hour long.
"Last time that you arrived in Cabo you would of arrived at the International Terminal 2 site. At the current time that terminal is closed and all Flights are currently arriving at the airport Terminal 1 site. When Air Traffic increase's the again Mexican Authorities will open Termainal 2 . When is up to the Mexican Authorities.Edited: 1:58 pm, June 22, 2020 "
Thank you. Just worried about the tremendous amount of people and long lines I experienced back in December
"Try to jet in before Noon, most of the mainland Mexico flights arrive before Noon. From Noon - 3pm it gets an influx of American planes arriving within minutes of each other. That's why it gets backed up. Or get Global Entry and skip the lines! Problem Solved"
"If you are trying to avoid long lines, I recommend flying in/out of SJD in the middle of the week. Not only will lines be shorter, flights are also cheaper which is a nice bonus. This is true regardless of pandemic or not, because lots of travelers to Cabo want to fly on Saturday/Sunday to align with their timeshare rentals."
Zero line when I went in 2 weeks ago just the 15 people from the flight
"@# 5 Where was your flight departing from, if I may ask. ? Was it a direct flight? Did you have to wear a mask for the entire flight all the time ?Thanks in advance"
"People must be confusing Customs/Aduana with Immigration/Migracion.I flew back on June 11th and they bused us from the tarmac at Terminal 1 to Terminal 2, which is closed. The line at Immigration was non-existent but at Customs, very long and slow despite there being only a few passengers. They had a single agent working and after about 15 minutes a second came to help."
"I flew from Dallas my experience was different then Candids. They bused us to neither terminal 1 or 2 but a building to the right of terminal 1. There were more custom agents then passengers on the plane. They took us 10 at a time lined us up took our passport etc and a questionnaire they made us fill out stating where you've been the last 2 weeks. Went into a backroom with all our passports came back with them stamped took about 5 minutes was very quick. Outside of having to walk to terminal 1 with my luggage wasn't bad. I kept my mask on the whole time same with everyone else on planeEdited: 11:25 am, June 23, 2020 "
