"I am aware of the new restrictions, but I was just wondering if people have been allowed to walk around at Short Pump mall as long as they distance themselves? I know some of the restaurants are doing takeout, so there is some activity there. Also, is the Belle Island general area open?"
"According to the Short Pump website's covid-19 update, the interior and exterior common areas have ceased to be open."
Family member works in the area and said nothing is open.
Thank you. I haven't been over that way so wasn't sure what was going on. I keep getting email updates from a restaurant that was doing take out so that is why I wondered.
