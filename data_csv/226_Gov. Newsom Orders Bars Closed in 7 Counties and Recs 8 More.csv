"Gov. Newsom ordered bars to close in these counties:Frenso, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Los Angeles, San Joaquin and Tulare.He went on to recommend that they be closed in these counties: Contra Costa,. Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernadino, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Stanislaus and Ventura. San Francisco has not allowed bars to reopen from its Stay at Home order on 3/16. Hey, I drink and I like to have drinks with friends at a bar. But right now they are fetid swamps for Covid. IMO the Governor's edict didn't go far enough."
I'm kind of shocked San Diego is not on either list. Things have not been going that great here for the past week.
"I was surprised that Orange wasn't either. Who knows why? Unfortunately this health crisis has become more about politics than a concern for citizens' health, not to mention their lives."
"Those were the counties currently on the watch list based on trends such as rising hospitalizations, test positivity rates rising above 8%, etc.Orange and San Diego counties so far have not seen increases large enough to go on the watch list. That doesn't mean they won't just that they are not currently under as close a watch from the state.Edited: 9:42 pm, June 28, 2020 "
Yep politics first .yeah one day Orange County is a hotspot and concernThe next Newsom is praising Disneyland and not a word about Orange County Covid19 cases are on the rise and everything else that was said 3 days prior.A doctor is concerned that the USA may have missed their chance to tame Covid19..And the EU doesn't want Americans in their country.
This is the state's county by county tracking for identifying those that need to go the watch list. Counties currently meeting the state benchmarks have checkmarks for that factor. Those not meeting benchmarks have the current number shown.https:/…COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx
"Don't mix up California's response with that of the US, huge difference.So far I think Newsom is doing a very good job under tremendously trying circumstances."
Thanks for that link FresnoFacts. It's interesting that our local stats show we're failing two of the state metrics where the state page still has check marks. It'll be interesting to watch how it gets updated over the next few days.
"Cathy, the bottom of the state page says last update 6/27. But that also depends upon what date of information they used. It might be a day or two behind."
"And if not checked off next week, Newsom can add San Diego and Orange. Having concrete standards is useful."
I think the question should be asked if the metrics should be tightened down given the fast upward rise of the curve. All well and good to monitor a fire line. Until it stars to overwhelm. Monitoring metrics for standards that seemed appropriate with opening over a month ago may need to be reassessed.
"It is not the metrics that need to be tightened down. It is the actions that are supposed to be tied to those metrics. This is not the fault of the yardstick but the failing of the tailor.I think Newsom fell out of his original fact based modality in large part because of the pressures to re-open. Per The NY Times, only two states are seeing declining cases, and we aren’t one of them. That is only one indicator.We need metrics for comparability purposes as well as progress and regress measures. We need greater discipline to take us where the metrics take us, coupled with the courage to speak truth.And so, San Francisco should stay strict and vigilant, and safe. I hope San Diego can do better.Edited: 8:25 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"I think we’re arguing both side of the same thing. If metrics were set that were thought to be acceptable over a long period of reopening but are overwhelmed quickly, well, those metrics should be re-evaluated and reversals to reopening done. Because, for whatever reason, the virus is progressing faster than anticipated. SF’s slower reopening has obviously been helpful. However, I believe SF was doing better prior to any reopening as well. This is where I part company with Newsom: his allowing counties which weren’t in a proper place to reopen in the first place to do so anyway. His leadership has petered out and is beginning to crumble."
in LA80 percent didn't adhere to the guidelines of being open in the hospitality industry of bars and restaurantsI have a hard time believing there are that many dishonest business owners along with employees.But I saw things.It's so weird taking a mask off to eat or drink .And talk and breathe all over everything. Then get the check and put Your mask on for safety outside..All people have to do is put on a mask to get in .
"I was in Huntington Beach earlier today. On Main Street by the pier, you wouldn’t know it from any other Sunday in the summer. Tons of people walking around, beach parking lots pretty full, and very few masks being worn. I think it’s a trade off we need to respect. If they open up restrictions, people need to behave responsibly. If not, the restrictions kick back in. I guess that’s what’s we’re going to see."
What I understand is the State sets the requirements for each phase.The businesses check off what they accomplished to the State in good faith that they met the requirements . Then the county goes on site and finds it hasn't been done during inspection
Home wine bars are very convenient nowadays. As are wine clubs with delivery. ;)
>>Home wine bars are very convenient nowadays. As are wine clubs with delivery. ;) <<I told my wife today we need to buy some extra wine and beer before it becomes the new shortage.
Oh dear. Don't say that! True apocalypse.
Oh good! I just wrote an email to Governor Newsom last night to get back on with the program. Nice to know he's listening to me!
"California goes from 24 to 96 COVID-19 deaths between June 21 and June 24. California media's reaction - We're all going to die!California goes from 96 deaths to 31 COVID-19 deaths between June 24 and June 28. California media's reaction - Zzzzzzzz.USA COVID-19 deaths have gone from a high of 2,749 on April 21 to 285 on June 28. That's 285 deaths out of 330,000,000. On average, 8,000 people died every day in the USA in 2019. Let's keep things in perspective, peepo."
"If you want to keep things in perspective, look at Brazil . Wow. So bad they decided to stop putting the numbers up. Kinda like Florida."
"Santa Clara County never reopened bars, so telling SCC to close them is alityle premature."
"Brazil and Florida are irrelevant and have nothing to do with California.All of 11 COVID-19 patients hospitalized here in San Mateo County, with a population of 770,000.Edited: 12:29 am, June 29, 2020 "
I got a number wrong in my previous comment. 27 people in San Mateo County hospitalized for COVID-19. 11 are in ICU beds.

Yes to the average Joe it's pretty simple. They are now saying the Memorial Day crowds had an impact on the rising cases OMG you must be kidding.LA hit an all time high of 2903 cases. A death count of 3300+. Over 100k total And Newsoms words of wisdom?We still have a lot of work to doNo you have work to do! Make government force what you keep telling us to do We don't need anymore sugar coating and Pats on the back for doing nothing.It's daunting that the biggest challenge in people's lives is wearing a mask while in public.Opening right before holidays is a bad move. Is that not obvious.
"Orange County, along with Solano, Merced, and Glenn Counties, were all added to the watch list today. Lost their checkmarks on the tracking site I posted on page 1.If counties on the watchlist do not improve they can see restrictions put in place again."
"I still contend that waiting until you’re overwhelmed with deaths is not the way to go. LA health officials are afraid and anticipating that hospitals and ICUs will be at/over capacity around mid-July. Deaths will follow a few weeks after. Orange and San Diego counties have curves that should have public health officials fearing the worst. Why beaches in SoCal are not closing prior to July 4 is anyone’s guess. Well, it’s got me scratching my head anyway. Hospitalizations are costing the state and nation huge amounts of money. So if people are worried about only about the economy, then keeping people from getting infected, and therefore out of the hospital, should be a priority."
"San Diego County is closing bars again on Wednesday, ahead of the July 4th weekend. I think that's a local decision, not mandated by the state."
I said a long time ago bring in the National Guard to get the job done. Someone said only Orange County would do that when I LOL when they ordered SAH self quarantine.You know so many aren't going to Self. Anything That's right OC was a leader in opening the beach just in time for Memorial Day. And the Sheriff's aren't going to enforce anything.We're just peasants around here.And the reason for OC is ANAHEIM and Santa Ana yet Newsom praises Disneyland for doing such a great job.Anaheim plus Disneyland is a time bomb ticking
"""I still contend that waiting until you’re overwhelmed with deaths is not the way to go.""Nobody said wait until we're overwhelmed with deaths. If there's a definitive spike in deaths for several days, then you start taking action. ""Hospitalizations are costing the state and nation huge amounts of money. ""Then why did so many hospitals have to lay off people for lack of patients and revenue? The financial cost to the shutdowns comes in the form of lost business and tax revenue, and huge payouts for unemployment and stimulus."
">>If there's a definitive spike in deaths for several days, then you start taking action.<<You did not read what I posted. Deaths will trail by 2+ weeks. By the time that happens, all bets are off. Principal Deputy at the CDC is quoted today: ""The coronavirus is spreading too rapidly and too broadly for the US to get it under control as some other countries have .... This is really the beginning.""Buckle up."
"I doubt we're getting or hearing an accurate death countAfter they ""reopened"" at some point they said we don't have to count the death rate to move onto the next phase. Today the State of California will make a new department to go after the defiant business owners. A tad pokey.When the cats away the mice will playEdited: 2:51 am, July 04, 2020 "
