"At Allegro I like the Pappardelle. Never had anything at Charlie's but a milkshake so I can't comment on that. Room service was 24/7, FYI. Unfortunately Wynn bars tend to close early. Earlier than ususal. That is the one and only downside to staying there. Ironically you might have been mere feet or yards from us at Cosmo on Sunday. Sadly, cancelled my Skyloft with Terrace this morning and already cancelled my MB almost comped Penthouse for my wife's October birthday trip, but it is what it is. Was told almost no one ever cancels those, which I am sure wasn't an exaggeration. From the tone in the agent's voice I think he has been getting a lot of cancellations. However, I'm sure we will both be back in the near future. Good TR, congrats on the Royal, which still eludes me."
"Thanks, man. I was at the Chandelier from 11 am - 7:30 or so on Sunday, so we might very well have been near each other. Sorry to hear about having to cancel upcoming reservations, and I'm not surprised at all if cancellations are heavy for all properties right now. I fell badly for people who were just getting back to work who will inevitably face furloughs and/or huge reductions in hours."
"Was there around 3 on Sunday at Chandelier then played some slots. Yeah I feel worse for the workers than myself, I really do. I know I'll eventually be back but the people that rely on tips, hours, this is going to suck. I've actually made friends with some of the people that work there. One came to my wedding! I leave them out of TR's for a reason. What really irks me is the attitude by the casinos of ""we are doing this for you"" not because the Governor is forcing their hand. Corporate bs/spin at its finest. Just glad we both got to experience a little fun before the storm comes in. It will tide me over for a while."
They may face furloughs but at least they'll be alive and without permanent lung damage

Your 1st paragraph is obnoxious. I stopped there.You are perfectly entitled to your views. Yours ways of expressing them leave a lot to be desired. You present as an attention seeker
Good. Please ignore me from now on. I deal with kids 180 days per year already.
"Lol, yeah, covid-19 ain't the only thing that's contagious, apparently"
I'm glad you had a good trip! We are looking forward to September and will be wearing our masks. We just did it and it was totally fine.
"That's my wife's favorite view in Las Vegas. Others may want to see Strip lights at night, we really like the view of greenery during the day.Doesn't Wynn still have 9/6 JOB on the floor at the $5 level? I can understand the waits for rideshare, but was there also waits for cabs? I would think Cosmo and Wynn should both have cabs waiting. At a difference of maybe $3 over rideshare.Thanks for the report."
"i don't know about cabs. i thought about taking one on sunday night, but like i said, i decided to walk. i was pretty buzzed or i would've been smart and taken one, lol. i think i might be staying at wynn again over xmas, and will play $5 job for sure if it's 9./6. i loved the golf course view with the pool as well. my only problem with the room was the window area got super hot in the am, which was actually okay because i tended to be in my room later anyway."
"also, ktinca, that was your advice i was following regarding high floor as south as possible facing the golf course, not kbunde. thanks again for the advice, ktinca!"
"""I deal with kids 180 days per year already.""Are you a teacher?"
Thanks for all the details.Happy you enjoyed your trip.
Great TR. Thanks for sharing.
