"I have reservations at Glacier NP in aug. I am 61 and have a 12 York granddaughter. I had planned on meeting my 35 yr old army son at the NP for vacation. He can't go now. I am debating on the train from Va.or a long car trip. I would have to rent a car once I got there anyway. Is the train SAFE? I am very apprehensive about being alone. Airlines look so crazy these days, and I could not wear a mask for that long. Any suggestions?"
Not sure in what context you are asking about safe. If you are considering the Empire Builder it is a safe.
Safe in terms of travelling alone? I'd say yes it is. Safe as in not catching covid-19? I'd say it'd be as safe as flying.
In terms of not caching coronavirus the train is probably less safe than flying. Airlines specificity American and United are getting stricter about mask rules but as far as I know Amtrak is less strict you will need to have one to board the train but once on board a lot of people take them off. You do what you think is best for you Iif it were me I would probably wait until things are back to normal before I would go.
"The train is, of course, safe travel. Amtrak has done more to protect its staff and passengers. It’s not the land excursion that we’ve come to love but is safer that the packed airplane fuselage with recirculated air. However COVID-19 is a predator. You and your grandchild are at susceptible ages. If you drive, you may find the States partially closed to your travel plans. Washington DC, NYC, Chicago are still closed. Many places, like Chicago, are trying to open for their citizens but they’re not open for tourism. Many States have tried to open too soon and are seeing a rise in COVID-19. Montana is one of them. Postpone your trip until 2021.Edited: 8:09 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"A magazine published recent passenger counts for some long distance trains. The Empire Builder carried., at most, 24 passengers at any one time. That's half a bus load spread over several railway cars.You would be very far part for any other travellers.I would prefer train to crowded airports and planes any time, That's assuming the trains are still running and that inter-state travel is permitted. The situation in Europe is not much different. Trains are running with hardly any passengers on them. Face masks are mandatory. That's another thing. If face masks are or become mandatory on US long distance trains, could you really wear one for maybe 2 days at a stretch?"
">>However COVID-19 is a predator. You and your grandchild are at susceptible ages<<Total hyperbolic nonsense. Children are the least likely to have any major symptoms, (if they have any at alll) - for most it is harmless. And 61 is way below the at risk age range."
"Worth noting that this question about travel in USA from a US resident has only had one reply from USA. I would think carefully about that advice. On top of that:You have to break the original problem down into levels.1. It was supposed to be a vaction with 2 of your loved ones, and now you are 50% down on that.2. There is every chance that what you can do at the NP will be more stressful/less fun than it should have been.3. The journey may be more complicated due to reduced service and schedule changes even before you consider the health restrictions.already it looks like it may be better at another date (in another year) and I haven't mentioned safety.If you travel in private Bedroom accomodation and take the meals as room service you will probably be as safe from the virus as any place outside your own home. But feel like a prisoner being transported to jail!Stuck inside your private room you will have a view on one side only and won't meet anyone to talk with, which is supposed to be part of the experience.Add everything together, safety shouldn't be a big issue but is it really still worth the trip?"
"Actually Cubsur, if you have a sleeping compartment you would not be wearing your mask inside it. The mask would be worn in areas outside the sleeping compartment in the public areas and when you tired of wearing in public spaces just go back to your compartment and take it off."
"Uhh, cubsur, you’re a bit far afield. Amtrak has announced reducing everyday long distance service to 3 per week. Some 5 regional trains a day services been cut back to 1 or two but not cancelled. The trains are still running.There has never been and will never be a ban on inter-State travel. Facemasks are mandatory on Amtrak in the Public Cars, which includes chair cars. You may remove your masks in your private sleeping compartments.Mari, postpone your trip until next year.Edited: 5:26 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"Sort of bored so clicked this forum to read. I’m not a contributor here but I encourage you to read the Montana forum carefully regarding what is open in the Glacier NP area and what is closed to see if this will impact the planned trip for you and your granddaughter. https:/…ShowForum-g28947-i982-Montana.htmlA number of people have posted on the Yellowstone forum that they have changed plans from Glacier to Yellowstone/Grand Tetons due to closures. However, Yellowstone is not conveniently accessible by train.I’m completely aware you did not ask for this information but felt I should make sure you did some research regarding your destination.Edited: 12:32 am, June 20, 2020 "
"""Uhh, cubsur, you’re a bit far afield""Accepted! Things are changing fast, sometimes not for the better.And some of the changes we like least may become permanent."
"Bungle I owe you an apology. For example, Florida had 4,024 new COVID-19 case yesterday. A one day count, and the mean age is 37.Great suggestions D0bby. Montana is having a new spike in cases too.Edited: 11:32 am, June 20, 2020 "
"@13 Nonsense. It was stated that ""COVID-19 is a predator. You and your grandchild are at susceptible ages"", that is total cobblers.What are you suggesting, that people never leave house? In the UK only the over 70s are considered significantly at risk that they needed to isolate.You know what I see? I see lot of people on social media who have got them themselves whipped up into a hysteria, thinking COVD-19 is some kind of new Black Death. It's not even close to being that. Yet again people prove they are incapable of thinking for themselves, and absorbing the information that is out there. The hysteria is more scary than the disease itself if you ask me, and that is not very scary at all."
"@Bungle73, it's nice to start the day with a bit of reason and common sense. Thank you for that!"
I wonder if your views would be the same if one of your loved ones had succumbed to the virus?Or indeed working or connected to someone working in trying circumstances to save lives?
@How would that change the facts?
The facts according to Bungle are also available in a thread on UK train company policy in which he denied a UK Government statement had been made - even though it was done live on TV and the video is still online.I think this thread has run it's course.

"""I think this thread has run it's course.""Steve, I think you are right. The OP hasn't been back to check and let the forum know the answers to followup questions or what she thinks about the actual advice given. Hopefully the wrangling among members hasn't scared her off from participating.FWIW the Blackfeet Nation have still not made a decision on opening their tribal lands to the public so the East side of Glacier is still shut down."
"Even though the OP hasn't been back, I thought I'd post the information that was just released this afternoon from the Blackfeet Nation on the Eastern Border of Glacier. This is a copy/paste from a thread on the Yellowstone forum:""The Blackfeet Tribe just announced (around 5 pm MST) on their Blackfeet Covid-19 Incident Command Facebook page that the East Side of Glacier Park will be closed for the remainder of the 2020 Season.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:WHEREAS, The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council passed the “Blackfeet Tribe COVID-19 Ordinance” No. 121 and Resolution No. 2020-181 “ Reaffirming the Declaration Addressing the COVID-19 Outbreak for the Blackfeet Reservation” and further orders for the purpose of limiting the risk of infection from the global pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 to members and residents of the Blackfeet Reservation, andWHEREAS, Based on the spike in COVID-19 cases in Montana and the health and safety risk to the residents of the Blackfeet Reservation have high numbers of health disparities, the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council hereby desires to close the eastern border of Glacier National Park for the protection of the residents of the Blackfeet Reservation for the rest of the 2020 tourism season, nowTHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:1. Closure of the Eastern Border of Glacier National Park. The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council hereby closes the Eastern Border of Glacier National Park into the Blackfeet Reservation including all the following roads: Two Medicine, Chief Mountain, St. Mary’s, Cut Bank Creek, and Many Glacier until end of the 2020 tourism season.2. Penalty. Violation of this resolution shall be subject to the penalties prescribed pursuant to Ordinance #121.3. Public Advertisement. The Public Relations Specialist is hereby directed to make notice effective immediately of this Resolution to the Public.https:/…********************************************************""To the OP, regardless of whether you decide to travel by train or fly or drive, unfortunately Glacier is not a good destination this summer."
"@ Steve8482 and Bungle: Since this is a post regarding Amtrak USA, your answers and guesses from the UK don't hold water over here. We're having our own Covid-19 problems and they're getting worse. The EU just banned travel from the USA because of it. D0bby has a second answer not Covid related. Glacier is closed. Third; the Canadian border is closed."

"""In the UK only the over 70s are considered significantly at risk that they needed to isolate.""Not only the over 70s."
>>Not only the over 70s.<<Er that is the only part that is relevant to this conversation..........
