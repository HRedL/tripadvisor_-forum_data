Wondering when one can expect Australia to open its borders to foreign tourists. Was hoping to go in October or November.
"There's mention in the thread attached, that it could be December, but personally I've not heard or read of any date at this stage - https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g25…"
"To be honest, no-one has any idea. There is no official word of when the Australia will open it's borders to international travel again. However, if I was a betting man, I wouldn't be putting my money on them being opened again before Christmas."
"For sometime now the Prime Minster has advise us that overseas travel will not be possible in 2020. Other than the 'Travel Bubble "" within the region.Last week, a group came out and advise that they wanted travel NZ to Australia in July. Mr Peters from NZ said not before September.The issue Australia has is Covid 19 , being imported. The last case is Diplomat Returning and he did not have to use the Hotel System of Quarantine. Add to this the what happened over the weekend, Australia might have been set back for at least 28 days at best.There are a lot of good news stories , such as the new screen machine being developed in Australia , some promising Vaccines.So my opinion is , 2021 will see some opening up to some countries, which ones will depend on factors yet to be determine.New Zealand is ahead of Australia , once we have no cases or even very few traced one , the New Zealand -Australia will open. Then it will depend on the agreements. Here is an example, say Malaysia has low casesand they only let in people from other low risk countries , this might be possible for Australians to travel there . However if Malaysia was to open to high risk countries, then cannot see that travel between the two being possible.Good Luck and Stay safeEdited: 9:20 pm, June 08, 2020 "
My guess - mid 2021 for Europe and the US.
"Luigi, when you look at the graph you posted, it is amazing how well some of the Asian countries are handling the current situation. For example, Malaysia has a death rate /1 million of 4, Thailand 0.8, Hong Kong 0.5 Taiwan 0.3 and Vietnam hasn't even recorded a death yet. Then look at some of the European statistics, UK 598, France 448 and Belgium 829."
"Navy, I wonder how much of that is because of different testing regimes. You can't report a death if you haven't tested anyone. It also seems to be ""attacking"" first world countries first, so I also wonder if those Asian nations haven't seen the worst of it yet. Then again, with travel curtailed, it may not even become a problem there. Interesting times."
"In the case of some of the Asian countries, they have had previous experience with SARS and MERS, and so they have learned from those experiences."
"Totally correct Ed. I think some of the Asian countries learnt a lot from previous situations. Loki, I understand where you are coming from and generally, I agree with you. I do find it hard to believe that Vietnam hasn't had one solidary death. However, as a very frequent traveller to both Taiwan and Hong Kong, I would put them right up with the most developed countries in the world ."
aaron.. the usa is still averaging between 15-20 000 new cases daily and this hasnt slowed...unless by some miracle a vaccine is found - it wont be this year.
I also don't think they'll open the borders to Europe until probably mid next year and the USA in late 2021
Someone posted a link to a proposal by tourism for a date of 15th December. That is optimistic and hasn’t been accepted by the government.So you’veno chance of October or November. Look at 2021. Us needs to have this under control before you’ll be welcomed. Same goes for Europe.
"Similar to other posts, I think your chances of getting to Australia this year are really slim. No-one knows an exact date but state borders within Australia are still closed so not much chance of international travel anytime soon.I would look at end of 2021."
"A lot can and does happen in 6 months. I am hoping by years end the Australian government can be convinced it's safe to let in some of us naughty countries from Europe. (if we buck up)#14 I think end 2021 is a bit of a long shot. I am sure as soon as the Aussy Government and scientist are comfortable with the numbers they will want as many world tourists in as possible, and hopefully once again this is going to be very early in the new year. I will be at the front of the queue."
Australia will not open its borders to people from the UK until the UK has the pandemic under control with zero new infections. Do you really think that this will be the position early next year?
Waft happens if you have to transit through an “Unsafe” Country to reach Australia? I’m in Ireland and we are in single figures of daily cases and fatalities. However I would need to travel to Australia via the UK or UAE
No one knows. It’s a waiting game. Until the government decides all we can do is guess. It’s possible that even with borders open they ay retain 2 weeks quarantine. That may be fine for someone coming out for 2 months to visit relos not so much for a tourist coming for 3 weeks.I can’t see them treating Ireland different from the U.K. ecause of the Common Travel area.
"Ryan, Here is my take on it, there are those who can get things down. In the case you mention it would be in the Airlines interest to see seamless transfer.This means handling the transit very well and keeping the risk low.This would mean taking measures to keep the risk down, such as in transit Lounge . However , you might have to fly LHR-BKK-SYD on Thai Airways .The Quarantine thing, I am in the camp it will not happen, it is just been a nightmare, this was proven again this week. It has had too many problems. It started with self isolation at home. Then people did not comply. then we went to the next stage of Hotels, again has not work very well. The issue was people left the Hotel. Because they are not goals . In addition you really need the whole hotel for the purpose . They have been landing flights in Canberra , yesterday we saw another one. Details on quarantine , where not in the press package . What I do know we will not see another here for more than two weeks.Lastly the cost was picked up by the tax payer. Some got 5 Star and others got the IBIS. I think now most agree , we wait and see. Some days we fell we are moving forward, then something happens and we are pushed back, such as events over the weekend .Just got to wait.Good Luck"
Yes you are correct.It just would be good to be able to start planning

"Post 21, you make a good point, the Population of the USA is more than 10 times that of Australia.More like 12My understanding is the death rate in the USA is 340 per million. Australia is 4 people per million.We too have had an issue last weekend that has set us back by at least 28 days. We have our fair share of dumbies too !While testing is great, it is just one of the tools used . Many will test Negative , however this is not 100%Many people have lost jobs, businesses have shut for good. Many people will go bankrupt . Many will lose their house.Good Luck and Stay safe"
If Australia goes covid free like NZ (difficult but not too far off) the covid free dividend of no social distancing is of great economic benefit and far outweighs the value of international tourism.The first challenge will be international business travel followed closely by international student travel. Widespread international tourism is a very distant third.The bubble with NZ and south Pacific nations will be pursued but it is of marginal benefit to Australian tourism. Most travel will be family reunions.For what it is worth many of the successful South East Asia countries will be doing the same.Europe and the US will be pursuing completely different paths and therefore comparisons are hard.Of course I could be wrong...who knows
"Post 23 You are partly correct, on the NZ -Australia.I was at dinner on Tuesday night, with group of friends that all travel out of Australia quite bit.One person is waiting to visit her grand daughter who has moved to NZ. There are a lot of people from NZ who have family here so, yes there will be family trips. However , I did see a package on the News and there are lot of New Zealanders who travel here and go to places like Queensland and it is not all all staying with family.When I was flying on Emirates to Bangkok, in the days of EK 418+ 419 , I would meet a lot of people from NZ going to Thailand during the winter.So , I think that many people will travel NZ-Australia as this is one place they can go.Yes probably countries will open for Business Travel .However, as person who worked for large companies who would send us overseas, I see this travel will be few and far between. This is based on the recession Australia is having. When we had boom times the companies I worked for had lots of trips on offer, moving forward , this is just cost. In addition is risk, sending a person out of the country , many companies might think what happens if they get Covid 19. Even here in Australia we will see less business travel as we have become a custom to Video Calls.Overseas Students, this will be high on the list for Australia .They are very important to our economy on many fronts , and I would say they are more important than Tourists. The accounting firm I use has found this .Yes , the opening with SEA will be important to your country. My cousin is based out of Hong Kong and travel through out the region. I have often met people from Singapore when travelling to Bangkok.Good Luck"
"I think our government has not made a firm decision beyond 'not yet' and will reassess as needed. I agree that a bubble with NZ is likely, they will probably see how that goes before opening up to anywhere else. Maybe Vietnam, since a direct flight is possible. At the moment it looks like we will get a vaccine for covid19 in the next year or so, I would be surprised if we allowed unrestricted travel before then. If there was no hope for a vaccine that would change..."
"I’m wondering how a bubble with NZ and nearby island nations might work. NZ has close links to countries such as the Cook Islands, so would it be fair to say if Australians travel to NZ then they will be mingling with travellers from a number of the islands (making it not feasible to only have an Au-NZ exclusive bubble.More importantly how impervious will the bubble be? Can people travel to NZ on their Australian passport, then fly off to Bali or wherever on another passport and then do the return journey? That leaves no indication in their Australian passport of that trip outside the bubble and if they don’t tell anyone when they come back who would suspect them oif maybe having the virus?"
The bubble is likely to mean that there are no flights to Bali from Australia or NZ - we can only go to NZ and they can only come here.Remember NZ had a tougher close down than us so don't think PM Jacinta is going to allow us to mess that up.
"Well you can’t currently travel to Bali anyway, and if the travel bubble is only for NZ and SP (which will be reciprocal) then you would have to quarantine if you happened to arrive from Bali. The bubble will only be implemented to countries that keep it within the bubble, so Australia won’t allow travel between say Australia and Fiji of Fiji allows travelers in from the US. It’s a bubble, you’ll only be able to travel within the bubble. Bali is not in the bubble."
"Hi,>> Bali is not in the bubble.<<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBZ7AfZR9xsCheers,"
"I wouldn't think it would be before 2021 unless coming from NZ or perhaps the Pacific islands. The PM has consistently said this.Edited: 2:23 am, June 19, 2020 "
Not this year and probably not next. You are coming from a disease ridden environment and will have to do 14 days quarantine at least.
"Or next. 45,000 new cases today"
Thirteen times our population - BUT 350 times our infections and 120 times our deaths. It will be years before we let Americans in.

Neal ... why are you here? Surely if you want to push a political agenda as you clearly do shouldn't you be on some white supremacy page where your lies would be welcome? This is a travel advice website ... and clearly this isn't the USA ... neither the site or place to push political agendas.

This thread has gone way off topic from the context of the OP’s post and should be shut down as further debate is meaningless.
And what are you doing here? That's the question?

"George Floyd's death was not ""drug-toxicity related""; while there was some evidence of recent drug use it was not in potentially lethal amounts. The official finding for the cause of death is ""a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained"" by officers who had subjected Floyd to ""neck compression"", and a second autopsy found that ""evidence is consistent with mechanical asphyxia as the cause of Floyd's death"".Go peddle your racist bulldust somewhere else."

A two year chick sexing course in Japan! But even then the best chick sexers just feel it in their waters...that link is gold. As it happens I’m off to buy a couple of poulets today to replace my dear old black chook who dropped off the perch last week. I’ll be thinking of all that has gone into providing me with hens and not roosters.
"Hi,Whilst chicken sexing give some thought as to how the black chooks regard the whites and visa versa. In the same vein as Basil's ""Don't mention the War"", don't mention Plymouth Rock chooks.Cheers,"
"Neal, you clearly have no idea what the protests are about. While George Floyd’s death was the straw that broke the camel’s back, the protests are mostly about police violence and other forms of discrimination against black people.It may interest you to know that we have black people in Australia, with similar experiences of police violence and discrimination."
"We had a trip to Melbourne booked for next month, and it isn't going to happen now for obvious reasons. Jetstar gave us a voucher, which seemed like a good deal a couple of months ago when the trip was canceled. I figured that we'd just rebook for the same dates next year. With the way things are going right now here in the US, I'm starting to worry that Australia won't be open to Americans by next (austral) winter (and I don't blame Australia one bit). Hopefully, the expiration date of the voucher will be extended if we can't rebook for next July. Not everyone here in the US is being inconsiderate and selfish in regards to the spread of COVID. Unfortunately, those who aren't acting like responsible adults are ruining things for the rest of us."
"We were just commenting yesterday that the situation on the ground in the US must be different to what we’re seeing in the media if Biden is now favoured to win . That is I assume most people are not out with their guns demanding an end to lockdowns with the encouragement of Trump.We were in the USA just after Sandy Hook and were struck by the number of Americans who told us they desperately wanted gun control, quite different to the picture we generally get.Our PM commented off the cuff last week that July 2021 would not be an unreasonable guess as to when borders would open. Our outgoing Chief Medical Officer, in an interview with our public broadcaster, commented that our border, until there’s a vaccine, will not open at the very least without mandatory quarantine on arrival, and even that is a second best option to no arrivals at all. Bit by bit you can see the border reopening expectations being managed, from initially, somewhere towards the end of this year, to early next year, now to mid next year. Essentially until there’s a vaccine."
And if there is no vaccine ? Which is a distinct possibility.What then?Australia cannot afford to keep borders closed indefinitely.
And now the EU will allow us to visit them (not sure how we get there and back home).https:/…world-europe-53222356Agree that the virus without a vaccine (just like the common cold) is a real possibility so there will be some interesting decisions on travel to be made next year.
Agree. There might not be a vaccine. We cannot live totally isolated from rest of the world forever. We are not in 10th century.We should open the borders for that is happy to stay in quarantine for 2 weeks and get tested at the end of that.Personally I would be happy with that.
"Interesting though that mandatory quarantine is now being extended to 24 days for those unwilling to take a test. The CMO referred to the possibility that 14 days may not be enough, although I don’t think there have been any cases here that have arisen from a returned traveller who’s done the 14 days. That to me, together with watching Brendan Murphy’s interview, indicates a firming of border restriction attitudes. As to whether a vaccine is possible, governments are going down that road until they don’t, indicating they think it’s worth the shot."
Yep Im with you Cromans. I think its easier for people who have many years of possible travel opportunities ahead of them or whom maybe havent seen much of Australia to be sanguine about waiting years. But for those of us whose time is rumning out and for whom international travel is a key part of their lifestyle waiting for years is a very daunting prospect.And as soon as I can I will be on the first plane out of here.There is very little of Australia i havent seen at least once But there is much of thr rest of the planet on the bucket list.
"Hi,I agree with Cromans and nozzie but won't be joining them.The real issue won't be Australians/permanent residents willing to follow this regime it will be those who wish to visit Oz from OS (NZ and Pacific Islands excepted).Certain elements of Victorian society have already demonstrated that they are unable/unwilling to follow the protocols and have cost businesses in QLD and SA dearly, just when their opening was imminent. Hopefully NSW will follow suit and close its' borders to Mexico too.Cheers,"
"Yep, it’s surreal to think all we took for granted, including international travel, could cease overnight and for an extended time. Just goes to show how fragile it all is in the end. Meanwhile I’ve been trying to book domestic travel and experiences in regional NSW and so much is booked out. Much of that trade would likely have gone to Qld I suspect, had the border been open. We haven’t had community transmission here in weeks, apart from random cases which I bet turn out to be false positives as there have been no further cases around them. Good for NSW economy though."
"OZ, we shouldn’t be leaving it up to individuals to follow the rules. Recent history tells us that not everybody can be trusted. There are ways of making individuals comply.Yes nozzle, I waited for a long time to be able to travel overseas. We couldn’t afford it and didn’t have time. Now we have the money and time and want to make most of it.We too have seen a lot of Australia. There is more to see, but we can do that too."
"Sorry nozzie, despite me being careful, the stupid autocorrect still gets its way sometimes."
No worries Croman!And the other point I would make about our wiffle waffle govt is that they said business would not open up until around 50% or people had the Covid Safe App.Well guess what? Only 6million have downloaded it and businesses in most places started opening weeks ago. So I take very little notice of their predictions. Plus NOT one person has been identified from that stupid app. I was horrified when I understood that testing is NOT compulsory for people coming in though- and for those who have refused- you are IDIOTS!! I am more than happy to be tested and quarantined. I just want to go!! And SA will not now be opening our borders to Victoria in 3 weeks as previously intended. Just too risky!
"@Nozzie, where are you off to first ie when international border reopens?"
Indonesia/West Papua which is booked for this October but will almost certainly be postponed and then Zimbabwe late next year if we dont run out of time.
Looks like it’s not happening this year.
