Short refernce of the last Press Conference today Mar 20 at 1PMOf course this is not offical but based 100% on the Press Conference...mostly guided by our Health Secretary Dr. Daniel Salas.As today:113 confirmed cases2 dead people4 in the hospital2 intensive care1046 tested no positivethe coronavirus is in 27 Municipalidades2 North American after 2 weeks of cuarentine are free to goroadadvisor
You are more than WELCOME !!Wash your hands and stay home....Please let us know if you may need anything...roadadvisor
"To my dear friends in Costa Rica, please stay home and avoid other people as much as you can. This disease is spiraling out of control here in NYC. By the time you see emergency rooms full of people it will be far too late. We will be like Italy, it is too late for us to stop it. I can only hope you can do enough to avoid this fate. There is no such thing as too much caution."
I read that the USA is 10 days behind Italy. I really appreciate this country taking the situation seriously before it escalates as in other countries. I wish tourists would realize how bad the situation is as many appear oblivious.
Dear Racandee...we are with you guys..and of course we are listen...hard to say anything...please take care of your family !!Thank you Nature...it sounds like a horror movie....but is real ...Roadadvisor
How come YOU aren't staying home????
My HOME is Costa Ria and I feel responsible for some passengers...and try to help them to get back home...but any way Im in MY home country Costa Rica...are you in your home country ??roadadvsiro
"The best advice right now is to limit the contacts with others as much as possible. There are jobs that can not just stay home. For them wearing proper mask, gloves, and disinfecting their hands, and in the case of public transportation, the whole vehicle as many times, is essential in order to keep the spreading curve as flat as possible.Roadavisor, I am sure you know all of that, and that you disinfect the vehicle after each client transported. In Slovenia taxi drivers can still operate but only the condition to disinfect the vehicle after each client."
"Racandee, hopefully the lessons learned by China, South Korea, Italy, some positive some negative, will help others to cope with the virus as efficiently as possible. Slovenia has started to implement strict measures early, but if they are strict enough, and early enough, only future months will tell us.Stay safe and stay home!"
Thank you XELAS...yes we are taking extreme ways to clean the vehicles...and try to keep at leats 1.5 mts...from each other once inside the vehicle.In same cases hard to refuse some people...and we are trying to help them as much as possibleAccording to last Official Press Conference by our President Alvarado...yesterday 24 new case ...in the last 24 hours ...ONLY 4 new case....that is great...hopefully we can keep low numbers.!!roadadvsiro
"Six months ago, the news was that 25 people died from tainted alcohol in Costa Rica. Now your country closed its borders because 2 people died from Coronavirus???In my country (Canada) more than one person dies every 2 minutes (270,000+ last year). Yet we closed our borders with less than 20 deaths (most were over 70+ & less than a year away from dying due to pre-existing health conditions).My wife & I came back from Costa Rica last month. We both wish we were locked down in your country until sanity returns!"
"The actual age distribution of Covid19 cases in Canada on Mar 21 is not what is posted in Post 11 - https:/…a3 . Only 30% are ppl over 60. However, the value of human life at any age, ""70+"" or any other, should not be dismissed. ""...less than a year from dying"" anyway? Wow!"
"If someone is trying to leave Costa Rica to fly back to the USA on March 23, will they experience any problems leaving? I'm asking for my friend. She and her family are wrapping up their trip today, and planning to leave tomorrow. Thanks."
"Gord_Edmonton, drinking tainted alcohol is easy to avoid. catching a coronavirus is not. Your other remarks are not to be commented. I wish you are lock down in your room until sanity returns!"
"Reneet960, to my knowledge foreign visitors have right to leave the country whenever this is possible. About the regulations on entering USA you must either find info on internet or ask on USA forum."
"@xelas - OK, thank you!"
"Tell your friends to get home ASAP. Most airlines are discontinuing flights back to the US VERY soon. For Copa and Southwest, for example, it's today."

Thanks. I think she is flying with Delta tomorrow.

"Costa Rica has 5 million people; 70 die every day. Since the beginning of 2020, approximately 6,500 people have died.How many people in Costa Rica have died from Coronavirus this year?As the priest told me 25 years ago when my 32 year old wife died; Old people always die, young people sometimes die. That is the way it always has been; that is the way it always will be...6,500 people have died in Costa Rica this year; only a few from Coronavirus. Why shut down your country from tourists & their economic benefits?Edited: 6:14 am, March 26, 2020 "
"The deaths from virus will soon increase drastically and infect and shut down your hospital system, adding more deaths from unrelated diseases, accidents, Etc. which can no longer be treated in hospital shut down.. Tourists will not want to go there to get infected, quarantined, abandoned, and possibly die, Plus many Airlines have already stopped flying there and back. Sorry, but just look at Italy tourist situation."
"Gord_Edmonton, one does not need to be a priest to understand that eventually we all will die. But why to die before our time is due? Why putting the money before life? If you are on the giving side of the tourism money, you can always send it to whomever you think is needing it right now. But do stay home, and thus let others be safer. When pandemic will be over, then you go and spend as much money in Costa Rica as you can! They will need every dollar."
"Oh gosh. One of those.... Can't believe there really are people out there who still don't get the tremendous potential this has to kill millions of people all over the world.Why oh why could it possibly be that just about all scientists and all government have such a strong reaction? Why could it possibly be that they are willing to shut down their economies, throw their countries into a recession, cause millions of people to lose their jobs, have lots of people lose their houses due to lack of funds, and look at a decade or two of economic recovery? After all, lots of people die in car crashes...You think that, must maybe, you are missing something here? Like basic comprehension?"
"Thank you Framptonian...Im with you...some people...are ""inmune"" and many other things...I love God...and of course a lot of respect for...but some . Priest are good for nothing..just to ask for money and confuse people...God save them...Today Press Conference...231 positive...5 intensive care from 36 to 76 years old..8 ready to be release...still 2 dead.2321 tested negative roadadvisor"
"Framptonian - ""the tremendous potential this has to kill millions of people all over the world.""Not sure if you noticed - mosquito bites kill over a million people each year. Google Search will prove I am correct!Regarding car crashes - more than 1.25 million people die each year from vehicle accidents across planet Earth. More than 350 died in Costa Rica last year. Should the Costa Rican Government shut down the roads? Ban cars & motorcycles?To put things into perspective; how many people in Costa Rica have died from Coronavirus? Facts prove that cars & motorcycles are much, much, much more dangerous..."
"You keep wowing me, Gord.Again, try to think long and hard what it is that you might be missing in your thought process. Maybe you can figure it out.If not, I suggest you urgently contact the WHO to inform them of your tremendous insight into pandemics so that they can disseminate this important piece of information that governments and health experts around the world have missed."
Framptonian - you have not proven one of my facts wrong! Or even tried to refute them...Did more than a million people on the planet die from mosquito bites last year? Did more than than 1.25 million die in vehicular accidents?Yes or no?If the answer is yes - why impose martial law across our planet? For an normal planet death rate...
"Gord, your facts are correct. No one disputes them. But your logic is wrong! Malaria has been eradicated across many countries. It could be eradicated also in Africa, but for some reasons, money is spent elsewhere. Same goes with many but not all other diseases.Traffic accidents and related casualties ... about 100 years ago the situation was completely different. Also, present ""martial laws"" (according to your words) will surely diminish that number, maybe even in a way to balance the other (coronavirus) side.Back to your logic. Not doing anything, the ""normal planet death rate"" would be increased by the death from the coronavirus pandemic. How many of those? I really don't care. Even one life lost is one life too many.YMMV. But do read a bit more about this virus. Start here: https:/…coronavirus-disease-covid-19.htmlStay safe and stay home!Edited: 6:19 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Any country's health infrastructure is built to survive deaths from traffic accidents, mosquito bites, Etc. The health and some other infrastructures get broken with a pandemic like the Black Death/ bubonic plague that killed an estimated 50% of European population, or the 1918 Spanish flu which killed an estimated 30% of the world population. The total death count by numbers or percentage of population are huge compared to traffic accidents and the other things mentioned, if this COVID is similar to those pandemics!We won't know the death numbers for CR or any country until this COVID virus has peaked worldwide and been brought under control. Sometimes a pandemic virus will mutate and come back to do more damage like in the 1918 Spanish Flu situation, making the final death count even worse than expected. Since quarantines have already been put into place, lives have already been saved and the final death counts when covid-19 ends will most certainly be lower- than if there was no quarantine!Better to have live people around to help with solving any economic problems resulting from the quarantine than not, in my humble opinion."
"Oops, timed out on this correction. The number of deaths for the 1918 Spanish Flu was about 3.0% or about 50 million people, but over 30% or 500 million people were infected worldwide."
"Gord - I don't need to refute your numbers. They are utterly irrelevant in this discussion.How often have your heard of entire hospital infrastructures in multiple countries being overwhelmed at the same time due to car accidents? How often do multiple locations all over the world beg for basic hospital supplies? How often do multiple countries pass incredible financial packages to help their economies survive the impact of high numbers of car accidents?That's right: Never.In addition to using such mute numbers, you are also using retrospective numbers - meaning that the number of deaths due to car accidents are known after the fact AND through longitudinal assessment. You have car accident data for many past decades. We combat the potential for even higher car accident rates by having speed limits, mandated seat belts, air bags, child seats, structural safety standards, etc. In short, we take action when things get out of control.Going by your ""logic"" none of that is necessary because people fall off ladders in their homes, too and we don't make them wear a safety harness and insist that they are strapped to a wall to avoid getting killed. Why overreact when it comes to car accidents?The current crisis has infected a VERY small percentage of the population at this point. Alas, if it is just as contagious as the common flu, then it will infect many millions - but with a mortality rate that is anywhere between 10 to 30 times as high across age groups, with the elderly being affected at a multitude of that.Let's go for US stats since I am familiar with those numbers: Roughly 10% of the population catch the flu in a given year - that's roughly 35 million people. Of those 35 million, 35,000 die. That's a mortality rate of .01%If we assume the estimated mortality rate of Covid-19 to be 3% across all age groups (which is currently indicated) and go by current estimates that it is roughly as infectious as the common flu (and both numbers might be wrong - this is a developing and not a concluded situation), then there won't be 35,000 deaths, but a little over 1 million. In the US alone...Now we're taking this illness into countries with far fewer resources as the US, and the effect on the local population will be much more severe. How many ICU beds equipped with respirators do you think exist in Costa Rica? Even countries that are much wealthier than Costa Rica are unable to meet their own demand - by a very large margin.I know I'm talking to a wall, but what do you think YOU know that (with exceptionally small exceptions) every specialist, every health professional, and every politician relying on their very best resources and brightest minds has missed in this?What do you know that everybody else does not know that makes them kill their economies, restrict movement of individuals, and threaten the most fundamental societal dynamics in so many countries around the world?What do you know that could help the Italians not have roughly 1000 deaths a day from this virus alone? What about the current 200 deaths a day in the US, the hundreds of deaths in Spain or France or?At some point you need to realize that you are missing the most basic points in this...And finally, what do YOU think this is all about - because in your esteemed opinion it has nothing to do with the severity and potential threat to life that others have come to understand?Please do tell!"
"I am calling troll. Gordo is holed up in his basement, bored silly, and is getting his kicks by poking the bear. Just ignore him."
"I am not that sure, CanaTico. Out there, many have similar opinion as Gordo. I am following only about 10 forums and at least half of them have similar posters. And not only occasional posters, even a long time members, even DE! So there is a need for them not to be ignored. That each and every of such wrong ideas to be replied with facts.Edited: 5:14 pm, March 27, 2020 "
"It's painful to see such utter ignorance and lack of logic. But that, too, is part of the human condition. I live in my own little academic bubble and rarely get to have such exposure - so it's simply stunning for me to witness.Current (Mar 27, 2020) projection of expected deaths due to Covid-19 if NO interventions (like those questioned by Gord) are taken: 40 Million."
"A bit more info for Gord:Italy registered its first Covid-19 death 30 days ago. Today, they have had 8215 deaths...The US registered its first Covid-19 death 22 days ago. Today: 1209...Spain: First death, 19 days ago. Today: 4365...All numbers are rising rapidly with the number of death per day increasing faster and faster.Source is Johns Hopkins University: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19Seems just slightly more severe than car accidents...Edited: 5:52 pm, March 27, 2020 "
"""all of the deaths from coronavirus so far in B.C. have been among people older than 70. Most of those in intensive care have been people over 60, she said.""https:/…If one ignores the hysteria & look at the facts planet wide; my gut feeling is that the numbers are similar. And before I get called uncaring; my wife & I are in the danger age zone. We just prefer to keep living an enjoyable life rather than hiding under our couch waiting to die ..."
"Gord, as long as you are playing with your own life (lives), it is absolutely up to you what and how will you do. But as this is not about ""me"", it is about ""you"". We are all asked to keep social distancing in various forms to save other people lives firstly, and only secondly to save our own.Sadly, also the myth that only older people are dying is already busted.So, what your gut feeling is telling you is very selfish. Tell him to shut up."
"@xelas as I posted two days ago, Costa Rica has 5 million people; 70 die every day. Since the beginning of 2020, approximately 6,500 people have died.As of today only 2 have died from Coronavirus. Only two out of 5,000,000 people. To shut down a $2 billion part of your economy because 2 people died; the logic escapes me...Nothing wrong with precautions; nothing wrong with reasonable restrictions. But to shut down your country because two people died... The logic fails me!Edited: 6:34 am, March 28, 2020 "
Ok. CanaTico is right. I'm calling troll.
"Indeed she is right. Oh well, at least we have spoken to others out there."
"""She""? Xelas, you know my real name..."
"My bad! Must be all that isolation already taken effects on my mental health :-)) So sorry, mi amigo!"
"The # of resolved cases resulting in death has been increasing, we are running out of supplies and beds, people are refusing to do social distancing. I personally doubt the death toll will be anywhere near as low as predicted. I left Costa Rica where they took action before it may have appeared needed and # of cases are remaining low. It has been quite a shock to be back in the USA watching how this is turning out here."
