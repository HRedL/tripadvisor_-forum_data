Hi everybody.Am planning a trip to Bali next month. Is it safe to travel against the effects of coronavirus ?
"India has positive Covid-19 patient. Indonesia until nowadays has no positive Covid-19 patient.You may read:11. Re: Bali Corona Virus update?Feb 19, 2020, 1:05 AMThat is true, they cooperation with Kobe University and have found the reagent for identify Covid-19. For common all Corona virus, Indonesia has do testing more than ten years. If positive, so the sample will be tested in Jakarta for assay, so will know what kinds of Corona Virus, needs about 2 days for it. With reagent needs only hours."
"You should be safe anywhere in Indonesia but I would not go to places like China, Hong Kong or India etc where there are many confirmed cases of Coronavirus."
"I do not understand why you are asking fellow travellers on a forum this question. Why would we know any more than you could find out easily.I also donâ€™t understand why you are worried about safety as this virus has been detected in India, which I believe is where you live."
