"I'm a U.S citizen who has been in Singapore for the last year.I have to leave soon because my visa is expiring soon. I've been here since before the pandemic. I don't really want to go back to the U.S right now. I've never been to Turkey before. I read on some travel forums that Turkey is supposed to be open.But I can't start planning for Turkey until I can be 100% sure it's possible to board the flight to Turkey and enter Turkey.. hmmm I tried e-mailing and sending messages on Twitter to: Turkish Airlines, Turkey's Tourism, and Turkish Embassy in the U.S and Singapore. That was about two weeks ago.I have received zero replies. How can I find out if Turkey is actually open and possible to fly to Turkey and enter Turkey as a tourist?Look forward to any replies"
"The answer is that although there are flights there is no guarantee they will happen on the day and every possibility of postponements. On the Turkey Trip Advisor forums there are many discussions which could be worth you reading so you can make an informed decision. Sorry not to be more definite but no one here has the knowledge to say “Yes go ahead, buy a flight, have a holiday”. It’s not satisfactory I guess but it’s honest."
"postpostpostpostpost, Yes, Turkey is open to visit with some restrictions due to Covid-19 of course. Here are the current flights of the Turkish Airlines: ""https:/…"", and Covid-19 rules at flights, airport and the city: ""https://www.istairport.com/en/covid19"".You need an evisa as a US citizen, that you can get at: ""www.evisa.gov.tr/en/"".good luck,enigma..."
Enigma whilst I am sure all your valuable knowledge about Istanbul and Turkey is truly respected by everyone you reply to I do feel in circumstances such as these no one has the authority to recommend travel to others. It’s up to the individual to gather the evidence and make an informed decision that is pertinent to their particular situation. We have already heard of many flights that had been scheduled being cancelled or delayed etc. People need to take their country’s travel advice into account and also to not attempt to circumnavigate any restrictions etc. Flights currently are for essential travel rather than mass tourism. It is a disservice to suggest otherwise.
VIP. Amen to your excellent advice.
Well said vip.
"VIP, I disagree. Of course I do recommend travel here at these forums. You come from UK. So if the Turkish government issues a very serious travel warning against visiting UK due to high number of cases of Covid-19 there, should I immediately cancel my travel plans? Of course not. I will do my own research extensively and make my own judgement. Travel warnings are highly political tools in the hands of governments, Even before Covid-19 has been in the scene, there is some good research that has been done on such travel warnings. Those so called travel warnings are written by government bureucrats who have never stepped foot in Turkey, and most likely would not be able to show Turkey on the map. What's more those so called ""warnings"" are pretty much politically motivated all over the globe and governments use it as political tools. These warnings are more often than not far removed from reality. The reality is pretty much expressed at the following scientific research blog: ""https:/…"". I always take these so called warnings with the grain of salt they deserve.Furthermore when answering these questions I do my own research. I called Istanbul Airport twice and Turkish Airlines once. The airport said that so far the airport is working as scheduled by the airlines that are operating so far, but PCR testing for all incoming passengers has been postponed till further notice. Therefore temperature check, and of course wearing a mask, social distance and hygiene requirements are in place and observed.It is the responsibility of the our posters to check all requirements, to obey all the rules of the airlines and the airports before they travel. They should also check the return requirements of their own countries to see if there is a quarantine or not. These are international forums. There may be disagreements among posters and DE's. That is normal. I respect your opinion and you and others should respect mine. My responsibility is to offer best current info to the posters and let them decide on their own what they want to do. They may or may not take my advice and that is entirely their own decision and their responsibility. enigma...."
"VIP, I post both facts and opinions and they are easily recognizable by those who can make a distinction.And I do not deserve the sarcasm in your last remark.Enigma..."
Sorry you read it as sarcasm as it certainly wasn’t intended that way.
"Very interesting thread, this, and I totally agree with everyone.It seems the consensus is a ""Yes! You can come to Turkey."" to the original question (thank you Enigma), and ""Take care to investigate the problems that may occur when you leave Turkey for your home country "" (thanks VIP)"

Where is yours?
"postpostpost, better call the embassy here in Singapore. My experience is they answer 50% of the time. Got my visa right before the pandemic...Good luck."
"@ #6 EnigmaI fully second this. My government has the highest travel warning for Turkey and many other countries. In Turkey's case this is ridiculous and politically motivated. Ridiculous given the number of infections and measures taken by the TR government plus the robust and excellent Turkish health system. Politically because my government want their citizens to spend holidays locally and prevent them from vacationing abroad. Turkey is a popular destination.So when I want to go to Turkey I have to make sure the TR Government allows me into the country. Which it does at least for now. And I will check the measures taken and any restrictions I need to adhere to. And if there are flights the decision is entirely my own.I had booked flights for last week with Turkish Airlines. There was a schedule change, which turned out to be convenient but then the return flight got cancelled. So I had TK convert the ticket into an open one until I found a new date. Dates and flights are fixed now and so far all looks good and I am all set looking forward to visiting this fantastic city again very soon. When returning to my home country I am supposed to self quarantine or take a test. I have no problem with that.Even if the countries were open I would not go now let's say to Brazil, South America in general, the US or India. It is my choice, my decision."
"@ vipfamily #3""Flights currently are for essential travel rather than mass tourism. It is a disservice to suggest otherwise.""Just to make sure - is this your opinion or is this an official rule? Have I overlooked something? For example in Germany until recently you could only book/check into a hotel if you had a valid reason - for which you had provide proof. Travel for touristic purposes was not allowed. The Turkish Airlines agent did not ask me during the booking process of my flight whether my trip was essential. In any case I think we are far from a situation like mass tourism."
postpostpostas for entry restrictions this is a good starting point - provides an overview. In case you need to transfer for your flight.https:/…1580226297.htmTurkey - not restrictedPublished 12.06.20201. Coronavirus (COVID-19) entry regulations lifted on 12 June 2020.2. Passengers and airline crew are subject to medical screening.For the time being flight schedules of any airlines are rather volatile. TK is scheduled to have 2 flights weekly to SIN from 18 Julyhttps:/…
In all fairness I really am not bothered whether people travel or not. I am more concerned that travel lust blows common sense out of the window. Just go by your country’s advisory to where ever you are admitted. All I am doing is exercising a little common sense from the perspective of an infection control professional.
"Some very arrogant people on this thread. No need to be so rude to DE vip who obviously knows a lot more about the situation there than you do, and people won’t respond to questions if you continue to attack those who take time to try and advise you."
"openhorizons2015 and josephineh226, Thank you very much both for your support and detailed common sensical explanations of the current situation. Vey helpful for future travellers.enigma..."
"I was referring to the two very unpleasant posts 11 and 15 towards vip, l think you may have read my response a bit wrong Enigma! There was no need for the two people responsible to be so rude."
"Josephine, no problem. I found those two posts you mention, very informative. Thanks anyway.Enigma..."
"#20 @josephineh226Can you elaborate on what exactly is rude, arrogant and unpleasant about my post? Are you not stretching it a bit much? Or could it be you feel for some reason protective of vipfamily when he/she got caught out accusing others of what he/she is doing?""So please Enigma make it clear it is opinion rather than solid fact"" and then """"Flights currently are for essential travel rather than mass tourism. It is a disservice to suggest otherwise.""Post #2 - I cannot see any recommendation. Each of us has to make his or her informed decision.It is entirely vipfamily's problem fretting over other people's common sense while travelling and then mumbling something about being a infection control professional. Surely not contracted by the Turkish health and tourism officials in this pandemic?This is a travel forum. A question was asked. The country is open. This is a decision by the Turkish government, whether you or vipfamily likes it or not. I know Turkey well enough to feel safe when travelling there. It is the responsibility of any traveller to apply common sense when travelling in any given situation. And it is nobody's business to make assumptions about another person's common sense.This is my response to your ""very arrogant, unpleasant and rude""."
"openhorizons2015, Amen, to your excellent advice.enigma..."
"Tell you what!! All of you travel, encourage anyone into your country, don’t even attempt to protect the country you apparently love’s citizens. Let money drive you. I take offence at vague mutterings about my professional training. At least I hold my hands up to where my concerns come from unlike some. Does the fact that flights are very much restricted not tell you that tourism is rather low on the agenda. That maybe thousands arriving from God knows where really is not a way forward. Advocating travel by those that think they can avoid the virus rather than going “home”. In most of the country it is mandatory to wear face masks in public. For heavens sake get a grip will you!! All your pontificating doesn’t alter the fact that this virus is around for a long time unless people are sensible and reading this forum ( all regions) they most patently are NOT sensible and common sense seems to have been blown away with this craving to enter another country.Sorry I am not driven by any economic reason just the overwhelming wish for people to actually take responsibility for their own actions and do all they can to beat this virus. It ain’t over yet folks!! Please help it on its way though. Get ready to welcome the second wave. It will come and probably spread by those visiting the country because they couldn’t wait another couple of months."
"Well said vip. I am also sick of people in denial & turning on those who are following govt advice and trying to advise common sense precautions. I am out of here... this thread needs deleted, it’s misleading and unpleasant in the extreme.."
"Isn't the fact that Turkey - the only party interested - is allowing tourists to return all the ""government advice"" we require ?There are two parties in this matter : the tourist, and the country the tourist wishes to visit. If the country welcomes the tourist, and the tourist is happy to visit, what does any third party have to say about it ?If the tourist's home country then requires the tourist to comply with specific regulations upon his return (tests, quarantine, etc... ), then again that is the business of the tourist and his home country. Every country is free to impose the regulations they want, and everyone is free to either comply with them, or stay home. What is there to complain about ??"
"Well said, Nicolas.Enigma..."
"Salutations everyone. Good to see you are still alive and posting enigma. Could be a long time before Australia opens up its international borders. Two years is not out of the question. The big variable is a COVID vaccination and it being controlled internationally.This was the first thread I have read in months. It does seem like people are getting a bit cranky, I guess the ongoing health concerns could account for this change.Take care all."
"Darryl T, It is nice to see you posting here again. Australia has been rather successful in fighting with the Covid-19 so I suppose the government is very careful to relax the restrictions on travel. Hope to see you here in Istanbul soon.Enigma..."
Can an Americans go.to Turkey July 2020?
"@jeri: Forum search is your friend, but, yes, ANYONE can enter Turkey (we've moved suddenly from one of the most restrictive regimes to the most open). However, you may be subject to health checks at the airport, which could delay your entry until the results come back or, worse, cause you to spend your time in Turkey at a different facility to the one you intended, and for 14 days."
"Can an American kindly STOP posting the same question multiple times within minutes?Edited: 2:43 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"Jeri, Definitely. Here are the Turkish Airlines schedules for flights between US and Istanbul in July: ""https:/…"".enigma....Edited: 4:11 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"There are no restrictions to come to Turkey. Both my girlfriend and I just came to Turkey last week. Me coming from Brazil and she coming from Thailand. Both as tourists. However, as things have been changing very quickly and with short or no notice, I advise you to contact the embassy of Turkey in the country you're currently located and also the airline company you're going to fly with. Good luck"
