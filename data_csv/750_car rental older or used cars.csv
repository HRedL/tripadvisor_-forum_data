"Need some help from the TA community. We were in Maui 5 years ago and rented a car that was gently used, maybe a 3 or 4 year old Mustang and saved some money. Ive been trying to find the company but im having trouble. I thought I found it a couple days ago on a rental site that had several older cars, as old as a 20 year old camry. I know its not Kihei rentals. It was not a broker for the well known agencies. Can anybody help me find this company? TIA"
Was it Frank's?Remember that whatever did exist may not when the COVID-19 crisis is over and tourism starts up again.
"scott sYou can get a great and reliable deal from the major companies that will be close to or even beat the 'old car' guys.This is frequently true even in normal times and even more so for some time in the future.Use Discount Hawaii Car Rental, Costco and Autoslash. A committed reservation without prepay from you - or even supplying credit card information. You can rebook/cancel if you find a better price later.I am so looking forward to getting back to that."
"Hi Scott. We often go with ""hawaiian rent-a-car"". Hawaiian transplant (his name is Adam), big hockey guy, real nice guy. The last 2 years, I have been renting a 2013(?) Nissan Rogue. Frank's is another one to check. However, I have to chuckle a bit. I love Frank's, but his cars seem to be falling apart on me. But, it is cheap. I don't think I've ever driven anything less than 10 years old. Maybe I'm just unlucky and getting his older cars. :-)"
We and our entire family have used Cruisin Maui Rent a Car a couple of times. Highly recommended!!!
"I found i used hawaiicarrentals.net last time. But im finding that there are a lot of options for renting a car in maui. I would like to support a local business, ill just have to decide which one is the best fit. Thank you all for the advice"
"Scott, depending on when you plan to visit, some of the smaller companies may not be operating. We don't know how many will survive the shutdown.The 14 day quarantine and the lockdown orders were just extended to May 31st. I hope you aren't planning a trip before fall."
Visiting feb 2021. A lot could change by then
"Yeah, much will be very different by then. We have a curious journey ahead."
