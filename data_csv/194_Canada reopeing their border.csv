Will Canada reopen their border before 2022?i am planning on going to niagara falls through an Amtrak vacation package in 2022.will it be safe to plan that trip?
"No one here can tell give you an answer...no one knows.Our governments will let us know when the decide.Doubtful that this will go on till 2022 though...plan the trip but whats the hurry?You have (+-) 2 years, assuming travel is summer 2022."
Our govt finds it difficult to work one month in advance right now so any speculation about 2022 is not realistic.
Your guess is as good as anyone.You can probably imagine what you would have been told if you asked about now two years ago so that should tell you a little something about the crystal ball business.
"Not being rude.but as a American i been following the rules by social distancing and wearing the mask when going to the store or out to a restrarant. I don't have the virus due to doing the right thing.I am only asking will i be able to travel in 2022 to niagara falls,Ontario.Thats all i am asking.and will it be safe to travel by then"
It will be in 2022 but not sure when yet.me and my friend are doing a niagara falls Ontario get away through amtrak its a four day package.
"Ignore the shaming Dawn... some people are incapable of seeing over their noses.2022 is a long time from now. One would hope & expect the borders will be open and life will have returned to some kind of normality. But realistically no one can foresee what 2022 will look like. I would proceed on the assumption that the border will be open, and make your plans accordingly. But I wouldn't be booking a trip now, for travel 2 years from now. You've got plenty of time to make your decision."
I doubt you could book anything this far in advance and I can't imagine you would need to do any planning for a 'package' really.......but regardless you should just get the cancellation policy from Amtrak in writing when the time comes that you can't resist booking.Searching the internet to see what happened to Americans who booked the same package earlier but needed to cancel because the border closed might give you some clues on what you can expect financial wise if the border is closed or re-closed after you book something.
"Hard to tell, what 4 million cases in USA, lets ASSUME they get a vaccine, improbably but not impossible.So do you bookings as you seem to be in a hurry, and GET CANCELLATION insurance, this would be not your whim but Canada telling you, NO SHOW."
"Our government has suggested it will stay closed until a vaccine is in use. It may be that you have to show proof of immunization to enter.-------------LOL a vaccine for a virus like this mainly helps the person who gets vaccinated. That doesn't mean you won't get the virus and won't be contagious, it means you shouldn't develop complications and should be able to recover faster. Also, nobody can get completely immune to a virus as it mutates all the time. So a proof of vaccination will do nothing.Edited: 8:23 am, July 24, 2020 "
"Life changes by the hour these days. What is open one day, closes another...and vice versa. I love to travel, and continue to book travels, but also I assume that they will cancel so I book things that can be cancelled easily.Currently, the US is not in a position for Canada to open the borders-it's not about you personally, but our country collectively.Book something you can cancel if you want to book now."
"Well said, Laurie P.The situation is changing regularly throughout the world, not just in Canada and the USA. No one can know definitely what the situation will be next month, let alone in six months or a year. So if you are booking anything right now, make sure it can be easily cancelled. Better yet, hold off booking.We have cancelled anything before December. We have a booking for Florida in early December 2020 and a booking for St. Martin in mid-January 2021. Both can be cancelled up to 30 days in advance without any penalties. If it is not safe then, we will not be travelling. Travel is a want, not a need. Life and safety are the first priority."
"@ 10""LOL a vaccine for a virus like this mainly helps the person who gets vaccinated""This is so wrong and part of the anti vaxxer mantra. Vaccines protect us all, the more the merrier!If you don't get infected with a virus you can't give it to me and vice versa.That being said, unlikely we will have a vaccine for Covid anytime soon."
">> nobody can get completely immune to a virus as it mutates all the time. Really? Then how do you explain that there is a vaccination for the varicella zoster virus, so that people don't get chicken pox or shingles? Or that there are vaccines for several strains of HPV (the human papilloma virus)? According to what's been in the media, there is not enough known yet about the coronavirus that causes covid-19 to know whether it mutates quickly enough to evade a vaccine, or whether a vaccine will be effective for a longer term. That's all stuff they're working on now."
"Comparing apples to oranges. These are not the same type of viruses. You get these vaccines once in your lifetime and you can never get chicken pox or varicella once you have been exposed to it. Covid is a respiratory illness similar to the common cold or flu, it just affects some people more severely. That is why people get flu shots every single year and they are still not 100% immune. I am just being realistic. I wish they could come up with a vaccine that can eradicate the virus but even scientists say that is unlikely.Edited: 3:41 pm, yesterday "
"I bet poor Dawn T is uninterested in the vaccine conversation, which is why she hasn't come back ... maybe the vaccines discussion could move on to another forum."
"I am sure border will be opened by 2022. No need to rush to book tour now. You can always book tours close to your travel dates. In case if you have to cancel the tour due to COVID-19 or otherwise, check out their cancellation policy as well. Will they give you full refund."
"I'm sure glad you're not a doctor or public health professional, Botev, because you clearly have no idea what you're talking about."
"1. Whether it is safe to plan an Amtrac vacation package in 2022 would depend upon Amtrac's cancellation policy and your ability to plan an alternative holiday at the last minute. 2. Nobody knows when the Canada-US border will reopen. Canada has taken a cautious approach to Covid, and from a political perspective the government has nothing to gain and everything to loose by opening the border before the US numbers come down dramatically. Will it be open this year? Probably not. Will it be open in 2022? Probably yes, but zero guarantee. Again, depends on covid numbers.3. Beyond the border opening there is the matter of quarantine. With very limited exceptions, anyone entering the Canada faces a strict 14 day quarantine . This might remain in place if the border was reopened."
"Anyone travelling to Canada for non-discretionary/tourism purposes now or then will not be allowed in, so quarantine is a moot point.As far as 2022 goes, no one knows if travel to Canada will be safe then. Enjoy researching and planning a trip but be prepared to save your ideas to the following year. You could even make refundable hotel reservations from the middle of 2021 and know that they can be cancelled within the hotel's cancellation policies. Check to see what the cancellation policy of Amtrak is before purchasing your package."

"First, September 21 would be the earliest it would open - the border closure date is reviewed once a month since it took effect in the spring, and typically an announcement is made a week earlier. It has been renewed each time it was about to expire.Most people expect that the closure will be extended into next year. And even if the border were to open, there remains the matter of mandatory quarantine for those entering the country. Second to those who want to use this and other travel forums to debate whether Covid is real, what caused it, whether different governments have over or under responded, please take that debate elsewhere.This is a travel forum - posts that go beyond information that assists in travel decisions are not helpful. You may or may not agree with the Canadian government's approach to Covid or with the American government's approach to Covid, but the reality is that the border is closed because of Covid and is likely to remain that way for some time into the future. Arguing about that decision or hurling insults on a travel forum will not change that reality about travel during the Covid era."
Sorry...cant resist saying: current thinking is that Covid-19 is actually a vascular illness not a respiratory illness.
"@Vancouverite67For the sake of people's safety, especially those contemplating any type of travel, it is important to clarify your statement. From what I have read in the most recent medical extracts, Covid-19 is STILL deemed to be a respiratory illness. That is how it is spread and so things like mask wearing, hand washing and physical distancing are still the primary methods of preventing infection.One of the EFFECTS of Covid-19, as more cases are seen and analyzed, is that it can cause and aggravate vascular-related illnesses. So if you get Covid-19, one of the results, as well as a significant contributor to death and long-term effects if you survive, is vascular-related illness. Your statement that It is NOT a respiratory illness is misleading and inaccurate, IMO."
"To be fair to V67, she has not said COVID-19 is 'NOT"" a respiratory illness, she has said that current thinking (I take that to mean professional medical scientists/researchers?) is that it is actually a vascular disease. I have read that too. I think everybody is trying to keep up with COVID info. I don't see anything misleading or inaccurate in referring to another point of view."
"Sorry, Mufti, but I have to stand by my comments. Please re-read post # 27. V67 specifically says, and I quote, ""current thinking is that Covid-19 is actually a vascular illness NOT a respiratory illness"" (the capitalization is mine, for emphasis).The articles I have read state that it IS STILL a respiratory illness, since that is how it is contracted and initially starts. What they are now finding is that, unlike any other human corona virus before it, it ALSO appears to be a vascular illness. It STARTS as a respiratory illness, but then develops and manifests itself in ways that are peculiar to vascular disease.I won't get into the technical details, but here is one of the articles:https://elemental.medium.com/coronavirus-may…So the original post by V67 is inaccurate. It may even be potentially dangerous to some readers or travellers if they think they do not have to deal with it as a respiratory illness. Nothing in the medical articles indicates that is the case and to that extent the comment is also misleading IMO.Edited: 2:03 pm, August 26, 2020 "
"Covid 19 IS a respiratory illness, in that, it enters the body via the lungs. Research is now showing that it can affect people with vascular disease. For example blood clots in the lungs etc... I presume that the poster in #27 was being facetious."
"You need to take health comments from poster #27 with a huge grain of salt ... back in March she was telling people that Covid was no worse than the common cold, and to be more concerned about the flu. I think most people with any common sense would pay attention to the medical experts."
"There is a study from the Harvard School of Medicine and published in the NEJM (back in May) that says : ""While caused by a respiratory virus, COVID-19 manifests as a vascular disease that leads to severe injuries to blood vessels throughout the lungs."" https:/…distinctive-features"
"@RTWhatever ""regularly scheduled programming"" is for cross-border travel during a pandemic, when no one can actually travel across the border!!! LOL!! ;-)"
"I got that RT, but we will have to agree to disagree. I usually agree with you on most topics. I am afraid that this time I find your interpretation of what is ""travel-related"" to be far too restrictive, IMO.This thread is about when the Canadian border might be re-opened. The status of Covid-19, particularly in the USA, is the single biggest determinant of when that might occur. So it is very much a relevant and ""travel-related"" issue, as it is on most other forums in which I participate.We talk on forums all the time about passport and eTA rules, how safe particular cities are, or what areas to avoid. They are considered ""travel-related"". Without a passport or eTA no travel might occur. With Covid-19 little or no travel will occur. So why is a pandemic that has put unprecedented restrictions on travel, unlike any seen before, somehow NOT ""travel-related""? Sorry, that makes no sense to me.By extension, when someone posts what I consider to be inaccurate or misleading information about the status or nature of Covid-19, I am going to comment, as I would on most safety issues. I, too, would prefer not to get into the minutiae of Covid-19, but to me it's no different than commenting on inaccurate advice about a destination.You can choose to ignore such comments or threads. Nothing wrong with that!Edited: 7:05 pm, August 27, 2020 "
Whether COVID-19 is vascular or respiratory in nature is not travel related.
"Posts 22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and maybe 33 were all deemed travel related and reinstated by TA mods. Post 22 had a replacement message that said ""Removed at the request of the author"" (me) which was not the case."
"On a general note, I don't disagree Frommy.However, with all respect, when someone raises the issue that Covid-19 is vascular and NOT respiratory, then IMO it does become relevant to the OP's question about when the border might re-open and is therefore travel-related. If it means some readers might think they don't have to deal with it as a respiratory illness, it will only prolong the time before Covid rates decline and the border can re-open.Unlike Australia, we have to deal with the minority here, but also that same minority south of the border that still want to travel, but are looking for any excuse under the sun to not wear masks or exercise physical distancing. That is one of the reasons our Covid rates, while better than in the US, have been worse than yours.Anyway, I am not going to continue to repeat myself. I've stated my position and you and RT have done the same, which is obviously different than mine. Enough said."
The respiratory vs vascular debate is not new or current thinking. https:/…12130856@38 “Whether COVID-19 is vascular or respiratory in nature is not travel related.” Weekly one line potshots are?
"#41, and what is travel related about your potshot?"
I hope so - I'm forced to by Canadian Milk and a plastic milk container. I miss my 99 cent milk at Kroger and Olive Garden! :-)
"Support Canadian farmers!! They pay Canadian taxes! They contribute to our economy! If you ate today, thank a farmer."
"Since when do you have to buy your milk in a plastic container in Canada? I would rather spend a bit more and support Canadian farmers and ranchers than send my money across the border. Also, we have Olive Garden in Canada."
"No Olive Garden in Ontario anymore.In Ontario, we buy milk either in a carton or in plastic bags. If you buy it in the latter form, you need a re-usable plastic pitcher to put the milk bag in.https:/…1-milkhttps:/…milk-pitcher-0422052p.htmlAnd yes, I agree - we should always be supporting Canadian farmers - now more than ever.Edited: 6:13 pm, yesterday "
"Thanks, phpr - you learn something every day. We still have Olive Garden in Alberta. Here we buy milk in cardboard cartons or plastic jugs so don’t need anything else to put the milk in. Also, we have to pay two deposits on all milk containers - a refundable beverage container fee plus a non-refundable recycling fee.Anyway, I guess none of this has anything to do with reopening of our borders other than I hope everyone supports all Canadian businesses."
