"Great news as a start, let’s see what the restrictions are. Surprised the UK is on the list. Thanks Manat.Edited: 2:23 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"I haven't dug into this, but I'm wondering if this is just a technical thing where the previous decree was to issue E-Visas from whenever until 30/06/20 and this is just extending the legal basis of the E-Visa system, rather than an actual decision to start issuing E-Visas again. I shall have a dig once the littlies are a bed."
"This must be merely a technical change to the E-visa regulations. Just last week the government indicated it would only be opening to markets which have contained the coronavirus. And the dates discussed are in the fall. https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/places/v…Surely, Brazil, Russia, USA, and United Kingdom don't fall into the category of having contained the virus but they are listed in the E-Visa press release."
"""....but I'm wondering if this is just a technical thing where the previous decree was to issue E-Visas from whenever until 30/06/20....""Yep, that would be my guess.Scott"
"> Pursuant to the Law amending and supplementing a number of articles of the Law on entry, exit, transit, and residence of foreigners in Vietnam dated November 25, 2019;Which is this: asemconnectvietnam.gov.vn/law.aspx…> Regulate foreigners making entry into economic zones of border checkpoint areas, special administrative - economic zones and coastal economic zones ...Only effect appears to be adding Cẩm Phả, Dung Quất, Nghi Sơn, Vũng Áng seaports, so I'd say it's purely technical as far as tourists are concerned until they actually start issuing E-Visas again."
"Ill believe it when I see it. It sounds like the govt thinking out aloud. I find it hard to believe they are allowing so many entry pointsEdited: 10:31 pm, May 26, 2020 "
India' and Brazil's covid19 curves are volcano like and I cant see them being allowed into Vietnam in 5 weeks.
"The e-visa pilot program was established by Government Decree and further decrees amended and supplemented the conditions in a previous decree. It was extended a few times, the last being until Feb 1 2021. It was also expanded a few times. Last November the 2014 Law on visas, entry etc for foreigners was amended and a key addition formalised the issuance and use of e-visas, to take effect from July 1 this year, so ending the pilot June 30.With all the essentials now enshrined in the law, this decree is legislative housekeeping to attach the lists of eligible countries and permitted points of entry to the Law in place of those in the soon to be superseded decrees. The only change is the addition of 4 seaports. The measures announced to limit the spread of covid-19 override this law - with a few exceptions, no new visas issued, entry denied to foreign nationals even those with a visa, visa waivers, certicates of exemption - until otherwise announced.RegardsrayzaEdited: 3:19 am, May 27, 2020 "
"Seems to be more concrete https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-to… but the proof is in the last couple of sentences :""This is an initial step showing Vietnam is planning to open up again, said Nguyen Duc Chi, a tourism expert, adding that for the policy to fully manifest, there has to be resumption of flight routes as well, apart from other things.""Who the e-visa would be issued to - diplomats, investors or tourists, would have to be reaffirmed,"" he said"".In other words watch this space. And for many, who would go on a long trip only to find on your return that you have to quarantine for 14 days. Certainly not me at the moment. I certainly wouldn't be buying tickets etc. The airline might even go bust or change flights at the last moment. So many variables and unknowns. I'll stick with my Christmas idea. Looks like a holiday in the UK for this year - at some point!"
"If allowed, I would definitely go.Tick a box to say you intend to quarantine... job done. The level of lying and incompetence from the wallies we have in charge in uk, I would simply ignore them anyway"
"We have direct flights from UK booked 7th August 2020, which I assumed would be cancelled/refunded. Now I'm not sure whether to start preparing to go, getting vaccinations, etc, just in case. If flights are running, visas become available and FCO changes its travel advice we won't get a refund on our flights... Could all be very last minute. Watch this space I guess...Edited: 8:34 am, May 27, 2020 "
"""...which I assumed would be cancelled/refunded.""Unfortunately, and it's only my opinion, but l would be sticking with that assumption.This 1 July date announcement doesn't take the virus into account.But seriously, good luck with it all. Scott"
"Thanks Scott - that was my take on it too. Just a bit in limbo as we can't book anything else until we know for sure. I'd rather just transfer everything to next year, but it's out of our hands."
"Fine to get a visa but we also need to book flights, hope in november to go back if possible, should have been in Vietnam now, instead were exploring the Netherlands"
"Hello,We knew this already, right?From Tuoi Tre News:""Granting e-visa from July 1 doesn’t mean allowing foreigners entry into Vietnam: immigration dept:""https:/…Take care :("
"> We knew this already, right?We'd worked it out. This is just Tuoi Tre News playing catch up since they either didn't work that out or didn't ask when the announcement was first made."
"""This is just Tuoi Tre News playing catch up""Yes, I suppose but it was good to see this article as rumors of Vietnam's July 1st re-opening were starting to spread......Take care"
"28th May""The National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control agreed Thursday that Viet Nam should continue closing borders to foreign tourists at this time, as external COVID-19 transmission risks still remain.The committee also agreed that inbound tourism would only be resumed once the safety conditions are met and Viet Nam may only consider to open door to tourists from countries where the pandemic is put under control.""…chinhphu.vn/Home/…40278.vgpRegardsrayza"
"Hi all, We were booked to fly out on the 1st July 2020 (EDI to CDG to HAN to DAD), that flight was cancelled and were re-booked to fly out on the 5th July. As off today, my flights are still on. Fingers crossed and if the borders were to open for tourists on the 1st July doesn't give me much time to get a visa."
> Fingers crossed and if the borders were to open for tourists I think the UK will be well down the list...
"UK yes but you could argue that Scotland is a lot better than Engerland which most people think you are from, living in the UK. LOL...."
"> you could argue that Scotland Well, /you/ could, but it would be pretty pointless. Vietnam will aim at minimizing risk and I'd be very surprised if they didn't treat all UK folks the same."
Australia and NZ have penciled in September to allow visitors into each others country. I imagine other countries will be watching to see how they do it and how successful it is . And then other countries with similar corona situations may follow suit.Some people are saying it wont be until 2023 when they expect airlines to be operating at 80-90% of pre c19 flights
https:/…
"I agree with you Ross @ 24 will watch with interest how you and NZ will be the first countries allowed in this September. I can see it being 2023 before some semblance of normality returns with airline travel especially long haul flights. Certainly will not be in any hurry to book any flights until at least late autumn and there is a big big improvement here. With the UK governments appalling handling of the pandemic and still very high infection rate I can't see us Brits getting to far east Asia this year. Hopefully a successful vaccine is rolled out to save us. Countries like USA,UK, Russia, Brazil and Mexico IMO could have big problems this winter when a second peak is expected, especially when we have already come out of lock down and infection rates are still high. I read on other forums speculation about these travel ""bubbles"" meaning short distance travel is possible between countries with similar infection rates. So for the UK the best we can hope for this year is Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Holland. Maybe Greece at some point"
Interestingly Cyprus has opened for tourists but excluding Brazil and one other maybe USA/UK from memory.Cheers Ross
Cyprus: far from openhttps:/…cyprus-covid19-travel-protocol20th June for category A. Category B need a recent PCR test. Plenty of countries left out.
Manat the fact that they are OPEN is the point. Not many people will just get up and go they will make bookings. The observations by me are on the basis of optimism rather than pessimism.
"I'm hoping for the COVID to die down or at least a cure, I'm from the united state and I heard someone told me that if we allow traveling to Vietnam(i heard the evisa it open again in July) which is a good thing but the bad thing is you have to get 14 days quarantine."
> (i heard the evisa it open again in JulyYou heard wrong :http://news.gov.vn/Home/Steering-Committee-VN-still-closes-borders-to-foreign-tourists-due-to-COVID19/20205/40278.vgp…chinhphu.vn/portal/… - the thing that caused the 1st of July E-Visa buzz is just an administrative thing following on from 51/2019/QH14: asemconnectvietnam.gov.vn/law.aspx… for the Special Coastal Zones and extending to more countries. It's nothing to do with re-opening. Been planned since last November.You can't currently get an E-Visa. Tourists can't currently enter Vietnam.
"Meanwhile...Vietnam continues on the course the PM announced last month, focussing on domestic tourism until the end of the Summer holidays (end of August) and planning for re-opening international tourism soon after. The PM reaffirmed this on June 9, mentioning some of the plans required from ministries, provinces and cities. ""Regarding the opening of international commercial flights, the Prime Minister assigned the Steering Committee to announce safe areas to re-open routes to areas where COVID-19 cases have not been detected in the past 30 days.""Before then, the Ministry of Transport has been asked to prioritise flights for Vietnamese who have not been able to return home and it seems foreign investors, experts and businessmen may be able to join them. MOFA has been asked to set criteria and a registration process. …chinhphu.vn/Home/…40397.vgpI notice there will be a fee for isolation. No fee is mentioned for mandatory testing. ( Cyprus is requiring a €60 test on arrival. The Maldives will charge $100.)Previous government mentions of using, initially, ""safe corridors"" and door-to-door short haul flights relates to saying Covid-19 free ""areas"" rather than ""countries"". The PM says ""no Covid-19 cases"" when the previous statement was ""no new cases"". I think both refer to community infections, not those testing positive on arrival and in quarantine.They are being far more cautious than the EU.Regardsrayza"
