"Hi we are thinking of going for a week roadtrip between the 28th December and the 4th of July. While for us adults the scenic view is the thing we are reserving for ourselves, the trip is intended for the children to see some things that are fun and of interest to them (ages 6 and 4). Can you please suggest a nice trip from london to london which appeals to children of this age? I would prefer to avoid large cities and explore more villages and nature. I would not mind going to a large city for the New Year's eve clebration but then again if there will be something the kids would like.Thanks."
Do you mean the 4th January?Not a great time to be visiting the countryside to be honest. Possibility of poor weather and many attractions will be closed.What sort of things are of interest to your children?
That's a long week!! Take it You mean January !
oh sorry thanks for pointing that out - yest it is January. Kids like animals playgrounds and play areas and science related things. Was considering friving up to Allendale Town for the festivities and find some things of interest along the way.
Those poor kids..!Do this at a time when there is a better chance of finding a reasonable choice of things to amuse them
With the poor weather and short days I canâ€™t think anything like this would be fun for little children
/would you suggest a specific base instead and if so where at this time of year pls?
"London would be a good base, still plenty there going on to keep them amused."
"I agree - base yourselves in central London for the whole period at that time of year.Much better than heading somewhere nearly 300 miles away.Most places in UK go into a strange kind of slumber between about 23 Dec and 8 Jan, and some attractions are closed. Fwiw we rarely pre-plan longish UK road trips between mid-Nov & mid-Mar. Hours of daylight are short and weather can be unfriendly.If nothing is booked already, I would change the plan completely and visit at a better time of year.Edited: 2:10 pm, May 24, 2020 "
"A road trip in January is a very poor idea, it is dark for 16 hours a day, it will probably be wet and cold, and outside the main towns everything will be closed. The children will be totally miserable, I know I would."
We might still have Covid-19 restrictions even then - or have them reimposed because of a further outbreak. I wouldn't plan or book anything just yet.
">>Kids like animals playgrounds and play areas and science related things. <<All available in London - not just the zoo, but also city farms, major museums of science and natural history in South Kensington, playgrounds in lots of places, but particularly in Hyde Park.But all probably better experienced in spring/summer: nicer weather and much longer daylight hours (roughly, 0600 to 2100 at this time of year as against 0800 to 1600 in January) . Then you could combine it with day trips into the countryside and/or the seaside (by train rather than car - much less stressful all round).Edited: 7:14 am, May 25, 2020 "
"I too would suggest staying in London if you must come, much of the countryside is cold, wet and miserable. You can get some nice cold crisp days if you are lucky but there is no guarantee.Many outside attractions such as Thorpe park, Peppa. pig World, National Trust houses close for the period between November and March. The weather is so variable they cannot make it worth their while opening for those months."
"A road trip is not a good idea in December and January, full stop. Even though New Year will get in the way (higher accommodation costs) I think you'd be well served by staying in London. There are lo so parks if you do get some better weather and plenty of things to do that will keep the little ones entertained.Staying in one place will also avoid the logistical problems of bouncing around different places with small humans and all the stuff they might need."
"Oh, I almost forgot. I wouldn't personally take 4 and 6 year old's to the firework display on NYE. There will be crowds and a lot of hanging about in what could be miserable weather. Watch it on TV wherever you're staying, and then if the children get tired it doesn't matter if they fall asleep."
