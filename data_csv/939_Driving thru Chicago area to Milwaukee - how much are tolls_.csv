"Driving from Virginia to Milwaukee and trying to avoid the $75 in tolls during our first trip. So will be on I-65 north from Indianapolis thru Lafayette to Gary - where I would prefer to take I-94 and I-294 around the city instead of I-90 - which goes thru the downtown Chicago area.Approximately, how much is the toll to use I-94 and I-294 around Chicago? Does not have to be exact amount - just ball park. $5, $10, or more?Thanks"
"https://www.getipass.com/trip-calculatorIf I calculated this right, it seems to be $9.20."
The cash booths are closed due to the Covid issues. You will just drive through toll areas but you will still need to pay online. Keep track of the plaza number you go through and follow the instructions to pay here.https://www.illinoistollway.com/unpaid-tolls
Thank you both for your comments - okay about $10. A bit more than I would like - but less stressful than driving by townWe have an Easypass from VA that will work in Illinois per my bad memory - but will check.

"IF, IF, IF you time your time passing thru chicagoland during off-peak hours (weekend mornings, late evenings, or real early weekday mornings), you can drive right on thru the city (90--->94--->US-41) without much traffic... 294 is a nice alternative, but sometimes it's no picnic, especially where it passes near o'hare airport...."
You're traveling during a pandemic and worried about $9?
"(I recently posted this in response to another question, and I hope the regulars don't mind me mentioning it again.) We have come to prefer taking I-355 to get around Chicago, which is west of I-294. Much less truck traffic. It may be a buck or two more in tolls, but it's worth it to us to have a relatively less stressful stretch of driving.Edited: 4:37 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"yeah, but the thing is, that's a good alternative if you're continuing westbound out to rockford, madison etc and beyond.... but they're heading to MKE.... unfortunately, a viable route from I-355/IL-53 up to SEW is decades away, if ever......."
"<94--->US-41) without much traffic... 294 is a nice alternative, but sometimes it's no picnic, especially where it passes near o'hare airport....>>Yep, big city with lots of traffic. We lived in the Washington DC metro area for 30+ yrs and detested the traffic. We will make a point to drive thru the area midday before the beginning of evening rush. We have driven on 90 thru the city several times - luckily, it was never been horrible but just some relatively short slowdowns. But getting too old for the unneeded stress - LOL,"
"if you go the city route, when you peel off to I-94 (edens expressway) north of downtown, continue north on US-41 to wisc to avoid all tolls... if you follow the signs and stay on I-94, it will veer you off to the tri-state tollway (I-294 south of this point, I-94 north and beyond).... US-41 is a divided highway, with maybe a dozen stoplights between the split and the wisc border, where it rejoins I-94. the speed limit is anywhere from 45-55 MPH, so if traffic is moving, it goes pretty quick.... the tollway will probably save you maybe 15-20 minutes (assuming traffic is good on both routes), but if you wanna save on tolls, US-41 is the way to go. check google traffic as you get close to chicagoland so you can fine tune your route...."
"Traffic is way, way down during the pandemic. Most days you could go right through the city with no issues if you want to avoid the tollway."
Fire up Waze or Google Maos on your phone for the best routing option as you’re passing through.
"What Wes & Dave148 said: Because of the pandemic, traffic on the Expressways through the City isn't an issue, even during ""rush-hour,"" unless there is an accident. I'd plan on taking the non-toll Expressways through the City, but keep an eye on Waze or GoogleMaps just to be sure that there aren't any problems with the route."
"I’d check the traffic sites on your way in. I have been on the road when I’m wondering, where are all these people going? And I have certainly encountered an afternoon rush hour in various places."
The Kennedy headed downtown is jam packed in the afternoon.
"We live near Milwaukee. In the attempt to be brief in my original reply, I neglected to say that we follow 355 to 290 to 53 where it ends at Lake Cook Road, and then scoot over on Lake Cook to re-connect with 94. (You will be briefly off the interstate, but it's a straight shot east to 94.) This was a pretty important part to leave out; sorry about the confusion."
I was wondering a bit how you went from 355 to Waukesha County. Figured you had to cut over somewhere.
Unless there's a major accident on 94 or 294 - 355 is way out of the way to get to Milwaukee.
"WOW, everyone, thank you all for the comments!Given less traffic due to COVID, we will likely just opt for I-90 thru the City. I admit that I am cheap and $10 bucks is on the high end. We have driven to MKE only a few times since it is just as cheap to fly instead of expense of 1 night hotel, food, and gas for the 18 hr drive. But with Covid, I canceled our flight reservations.After the first time with tolls of $75 from the Washington metro area, I now pay attention. It was stupid to pay that outrageous amount when there are free interstates essentially parelleling many of the toll roads. Definite disadvantage when using a transponder to pay the tolls. I was stupid only one time. On our current route, the only major tolls are in the Chicago area. There is a small $2 toll in West VA which is essential to save an extra 1 hr drive on rolling narrow roads - LOL - I found out the hard way the first time. I have also taken Rt 41 to avoid the toll from Chicago to the WI border. All those lights are irritating, so usually opt to pay the extra $2-3 there. Great idea to check Waze or Googlemaps for traffic. Hmm, but my data is limited because I just changed to a $3 per month cell phone plan from the monthly $50 T Mobile unlimited that I never use. Okay, I will purchase a data pass when needed and hope it works."
"Your tolls will be less because you have EZ pass, that was the cash rate. Probably about 50% less."
Listen to AM 780 - traffic reports every 10 minutes. No data required.
You’re worried about tolls costing as much as a hamburger but ignoring COVID-19 ??? Please stay in your car and drive straight through Illinois.
SS - they’re not stopping here. Just passing through.
Good.
"<< Listen to AM 780 - traffic reports every 10 minutes. No data required.>>LOL- the problem is that it would be meaningless as I am not familiar with name of the the roads, etc in the Chicago area. In Wash DC metro area, the traffic reports would refer to where 3 interstates intersected as the ""mixing bowl"". Or entering into downtown DC, you had 4 bridges that were always backed up - 14th street, Memorial, Theodore Roosevelt, or Key Bridge. On the DC Beltway, the Woodrow Wilson and Cabin John bridges would also back up. But if you were from out of town, you would have no clue where these places are located and how to avoid them. But if EasyPass rates are half price, I will be a big spender and opt for the toll road for $5. Thanks for that tip - an excellent one!"
