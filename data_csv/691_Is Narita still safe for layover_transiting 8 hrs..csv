"My flight will have an 8 hrs layover in Narita airport before proceeding to Newark, NJ. I'm nervous coz of covid-19"
"Who knows? If you're nervous, pay a fortune and change your flight."
People are still using the airport every day all day. We on TripAdvisor don’t know how many people are there with the virus spreading the infection to other people on 8-hour layovers. I’d be more afraid of the passengers getting on there and then sitting with me for 12 hours on a flight to the USA. You don’t know where their fingers have been or if they ever washed them to get the virus off. Although just having to go to Newark would leave me feeling uneasy anyway.
"Let's see..... Japan's population is 126 million. The Diamond Princess has had 691 cases, 3 passengers (all Japanese in their 80's) have died, 36 are still serious/critical. 17 have recovered and were discharged. For the rest of Japan, including returnees from Wuhan, there have been 146 cases. 1 elderly woman has died; 7 are serious. 23 have recovered and were discharged. How many die from gun violence in the US? I'm more afraid of going there than staying here. Here's a pretty good site for finding the fairly latest numbers. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
">>>How many die from gun violence in the US?<<<About 30,000 per year die from gunshot wounds in the USA last time I checked."
"Generally speaking, I don't find the airport particularly dangerous. The key is you should exercise good personal hygiene. That means avoid touching everything in sight and then bringing your hands to your face. Also, if we see people coughing without a mask, we immediately walk as quickly away as possible. You can always find somewhere at the airport not so crowded to sit.The flight could be another matter. Air filtration inside the plane is very safe according to studies. You can wipe your seat and the IFE screen and remote with disinfectant wipes. However, if you have passengers next to you who happen to have a bug, then it's possible you could catch some form of disease (not just the Cornoavirus). Wearing a mask, especially a more face fitting one, could help. There is still no guarantee though.I am flying (not to Japan) later this week. One thing in my favor is what looks like a low passenger load. I don't think I am taking a big risk at all. However, your flight and your risk profile are different so you have to decide."
"Sigh........ And..... 14,000 have died from the ""regular influenza"" in the US this SEASON! Fortunately, Japan's influenza rate has decreased significantly because of all the handwashing and gargling that everyone is doing. Practicing good hygiene makes a difference! Eat well. Sleep well. And flush the toilet with the lid closed!!! :-) petfriendly, from your posts on other forums, you were looking for an eye doctor in New Zealand and Australia. Did you actually need to see one? FYI, there are clinics at Narita Airport. Terminal 2 has an Ophthalmologist on Thursdays. https:/…svc_21"
"Mamajelli, Thank you for the tip about opthalmologist in Narita term 2. it's worthwhile to know incase I need one. My travel itinerary changed and my flight will transiting Narita 8 hrs ."
"I think it might be better to be careful about wordings unless you would like to get on locals' nerves.If it becomes unsafe, it will be closed.If you think it would be safer to avoid transit at Narita, just as Dr. Shibuyakko wrote, change your flight."

"Yes it is fine, the issue is about at 2-3 hour transition before Narita to the City Center and back."
"Some Tourist sites and disneyland will be closed as well as schools?Edited: 1:15 am, February 28, 2020 "
Schools aren’t actually closed across Japan. That’s just the wording they’ve used in the media to make it look like they’re making an effort to protect everyone.
