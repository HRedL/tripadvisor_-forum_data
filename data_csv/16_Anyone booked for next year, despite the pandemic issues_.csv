"Hi allDespite the tragedies and general mayhem this pandemic has caused globally and with the likelihood of social distancing continuing into next year, we went ahead and booked this morning. The price was good. It still took a lot of thought and consideration. Now I realise many, many people are waiting for money back or to rebook next year. But my question is..Have you booked orlando for next year and what will you do differently- or will you be giving it a miss?"
"We have booked for next year. Actually we have rescheduled rather than a new booking. We were due to go in Sept staying on site with free dining but with so much uncertainty we decided it was not worth the cost as I am sure Disney will not be back to ""normal""by then. We now have 15 months for things to get to some sort of normal. I doubt everything will be the same but hopefully by then there is a vaccine or the virus has run its course. As seniors we don't do many rides so if we find there are still no shows, parades, fireworks etc we will cancel and rather lose £100 than pay thousands for a watered down experience."
"Unfortunately we had already booked for next August and also had a trip booked for this September, both packages with TUI.We have moved this September’s trip to next October, and likely won’t go on the August one,purely as DH has had a previous DVT and it’s too risky to take 4 long haul flights within 6 weeks.We will only go next October if it’s completely safe, or as safe as we want it to be anyway. So that means either the virus has ‘disappeared’, which I know is nigh on impossible, or if we have had a vaccine.We are in the ‘older’ age group , though we do enjoy the rides!Though we are obviously hoping that we can go, we are trying to be realistic and not build our hopes up. It’s nice to have a holiday to look forward to, but we both realise that there are more important things to worry about."
"We’re meant to visit next year and although I’m optimistic that the restrictions might be returning to whatever the new normal will look like, I’m still holding off for now until I know for sure what I’ll be getting for my money.I live in hope!"
"I won't be going back any time in the foreseeable future.The thought of 9 hours on a plane wearing a mask, having to ask to use the toilet etc just doesn't appeal I'm afraid. I'll be perfectly content if flights to Jersey resume and I can go over and visit family once again. I think I can manage 40 mins in the air!"
I think we will book relatively soon for next May/June however will be booking with a low £25pp deposit so if it gets worse over the coming months we will only have lost £50.. think we’d rather get our name down whilst prices for next year are reasonable before good news (Hopefully) comes out about a vaccine or treatment at which point prices will go sky high.
We took an open ticket for our flights and vouchers. We are looking at next April fingers crossed.The flight prices were initially very high but seem to be dropping nicely. So hopefully re booking soon.
We re booked ours for Oct/Nov 2021. With the hope it will be somewhere getting back to being enjoyable. Who knows.
We were meant to be going this July and changed it to October. That was cancelled so we have rebooked for May 2021.
We was originally going august this year decide to move it to end of july next year
"We are booked for next May, it is what it is, what will be will be, I’d rather have it booked at a good price just now than wait and see then maybe have to pay more, everything is booked and only deposits paid, hopefully the world might be in a better place in 9 months when I need to start paying the rest"
Exactly goco.
"I agree Goco - better to have your name down with a deposit as opposed to waiting 6 months and paying extremely high prices!Edited: 3:02 pm, June 07, 2020 "
Sure I read it was VA ppmaiden
I read the same goco..Certainly easier getting flights back up to Glasgow from Heathrow rather than Gatwick..
"We were to go this August. We canceled and hope to go next August. Packages for next year are not yet released in the US. They should be soon, but we probably won’t book right away as we would like to see how things evolve. Our vouchers from JetBlue are good for two years (just have to book within two years, not travel).Edited: 6:24 am, June 08, 2020 "
"We've booked for February next year. We're going over half term and the price was so good we figured that if we can't go (flights grounded) then we'll use that money for another break another time. If the parks aren't open we'll hire a car and explore. I'm definitely going with the 'it'll all be fine' mindset!?I've paid a deposit on the park tickets (£10 per ticket, so £80 in total), they need paying off 5 weeks before we travel so I think by then (mid December) we will have a better idea of whether it will be possible."
"Following on from my previous post - we booked today for next May, got a decent price and added an extra 4 nights for slightly more than what we paid for this years! Fingers crossed will be fine however only paid £75 deposit so not much to lose if anything gets worse..Factor that made us rebook now was fare prices, been looking over the past few weeks and seems to have increased week by week."
Haha I know looking forward to it!! Decided to stick with Virgin as they offered me a decent deal!
Hi LiamVirgin offered you a decent deal..I must have missed the memo on that one. Why do I seem to find them more expensive?
"Hi PP - for what we wanted, a split stay flying from Manchester, VH was coming in same price as BA without the hassle of flying down to London then over to Orlando. I’ve found that actually speaking to someone and booking over the phone has got me more discount then ever booking online..Edited: 6:53 pm, June 08, 2020 "
Hi LiamI’ve had the same experience when booking flights with Air Miles..Speaking to someone who can adjust by a day or so rather than the “formal” online process..
"I am hoping to go on nov this was moved from my April trip I had planned , I also have booked for next March in case nov doesn’t go ahead.For insurance I got mines the other day by way of annual policy which covers you for catching covid whilst your there"
"Who are you covered with simple_stoo?Edited: 1:12 pm, June 09, 2020 "
You should always get insurance on the date of booking as the cover then starts from the date of purchase of the policy. They will ask for the booking invoice which shows the date of booking if you make a claim
I've rescheduled our April holiday to next April. We have 2 weeks booked for November so just waiting to see what happens
Sounds good Florida21 - next year looks like it will be busier than ever!! Fingers crossed for your November trip!
"Simple - the insurance cover will probably cover your medical bits with Covid but it probably won’t cover cancellation because of Covid, at least that’s what mine does."
Yeah PMP and to be fair that’s all I’m bothered about as long as medical expenses are covered I’m happy!
Booked flydrive 24th december 21 for 14 nights. When will 2022 prices be released.
Flights are usually released 11 months prior.Christmas in Orlando sounds fab!
"Christmas in Orlando is just brilliant this will be our first time since 2010 we won’t be there, we have decided to spend this year in the Smoky Mountains"
"We're booked for June 2021, and really looking forward to it!"
"for interestt will likely be ""months"" before travellers will be allowed into the US from Britain, according to Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.Since March, America has placed a travel ban on visitors from the UK, China, Brazil and the European Union. Dr Fauci told the Sunday Telegraph that the restriction could be in place until a coronavirus vaccine is developed.""I don't think there's going to be an immediate pull-back for those kinds of restrictions. My feeling, looking at what's going on with the infection rate, I think it's more likely measured in months rather than weeks,"" said Dr Fauci.He also noted that while infection rates are dropping in cities, including New York, Chicago and New Orleans, cases are still spreading elsewhere in the country""[The virus] could go on for a couple of cycles, coming back and forth,"" he added. ""I would hope to get to some degree of real normality within a year or so. But I don't think it's this winter or fall, we'll be seeing it for a bit more.""But Dr Fauci expressed optimism about the chances of a vaccine being developed by the end of the year.“You can never guarantee success with a vaccine, that’s foolish to do so, there’s so many possibilities of things going wrong,"" he said. ""[But] everything we have seen from early results, it’s conceivable we get two or three vaccines that are successful.”"
I cannot see that the US would wait months before allowing UK visitors back. It’s not just tourists They would miss our spend but far more important to the US economy would be business. The scientists may like to keep the country completely cut off for months to come but it’s not practical and I cannot see Trump listening to “ the science” anyway. A vaccine may never be available so would the scientists have everyone kept out forever.
I agree M&M - I reckon borders will be open both ways by September..
"I have now, well moved this years August to next year."
"Lineandalan, did you get the 35% room discount or didn’t you have free dining to start with? We moved our dates shortly before they made the announcement about a discount and lost both DP and gift card. We were told there would definitely not be any compensation for losing it so I have emailed Disney to see if they will let us have it. They can only say no."
"M&M I had free dining. But the 35% is only if you keep to the existing booking. Most got to keep their gift card and I was offered it by the first person I spoke to. But I was asking questions about if a; offer comes out being able to move my deposit across to the new offer. The reason is my insurers have said providing my deposit is moved across I am still covered. The supervisor agreed to note the booking that I can do this.Got to be honest if no offer comes out I’m unlikely to go ahead, it’s just way too expensive. Especially if my flights get cancelled and I can get the money back."
Interesting you can keep the gift card. We were told we lost everything. Once I get a reply to my email if it’s not satisfactory I will phone and see what they say. Thanks.
We have booked for early June 2021 and thoroughly looking forward too it! Lord knows its needed!! One very tired student nurse! Keeping everything crossed things have settled by the end of this year.

"PPMaiden yeah probably. I will ignoreBut you mentioned Vlogs. Tim Tracker is fine. I do feel though that he has been vlogging for so long that it’s hard to get a good overview. So rather than watch the home vlogs I have been more interested in watching old vlogs from other people’s prior trips. The Despicable three, RixFlix, Prince Charming Dev, Adam Hattan, and his friend Gary C are good IMO. If you have time to check any of those out. Adam used to work there so has some really good tips."
Tim Trackers current vlogs seem to be advising people not to go to the theme parks at the moment. He has had a couple of recent visits where the people around him have not worn masks or social distanced and it has spooked him .
Thanks for the tips October.. tim tracker is a new novelty for us but entertaining.Sure coaster.. he is off his mantle with the masks and social distancing.
I believe that Tim Tracker’s wife has compromised immunity issues. They also have a very young baby. I would be leery too in his situation.
Very young baby and large percentage of the US is not social distancing. Smart of Tim to try to social distance. Wish more of us were able to and understood why important.
Adam Hatton (with a Gary C) is our favourite Vlog.
"Adam Hattan and Gary C the best. I am not as excited when they vlog with others, who are probably lovely people. But the friendship between Adam and Gary is so sweet. I love how they look out for each other - going to shops they know the other would like, or rides, or knowing how much one loves character greets. It’s just fun, but they also include lots of time filming shows or fireworks and explaining food choices."
"Oh yes I totally agree with Tim I wouldn’t go to the parks at the moment, we are both in the ‘older’ age group so that’s why we feel the way we do. We have been travelling to the USA for over twenty years and have visited the parks many times, but it just wouldn’t seem like a holiday to us if you were constantly looking over your shoulder to make sure people hadn’t got too close, couldn’t eat and drink when and where you wanted, couldn’t visit the park you wanted when you wanted to, and had to be on a plane for 9 hrs in close proximity to many people not knowing if anyone near you had the virus.Some are saying Florida is going to be the next epicentre, I try to treat everything I read objectively but the signs are not good.I wish everyone well who decides to go, but the above reasons are the reasons we will wait for now."

"I think James is our friend pirate!Edited: 5:20 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"There is a difference between dying ""of"" covid 19 and ""with"" covid 19The news doesn't tell you of the multiple hospitals that have gotten in trouble for falsifying cause of death as covid 19 because the patient tested positive. In New York, my friend's wife died from head trauma in a car accident and they put the cause of death covid 19!!! People die every day and it is easy to inflate the numbers if they are putting covid 19 as the cause of death just"
James while that may be true you also have to look at ‘excess deaths’ Which shows that there are far higher number of deaths than is normal at the same time of year. Those excess deaths are way outside of an acceptable le margin to not be caused by Covid19.
