"Japan is obviously organized, clean and advanced in so many ways, but the things really surprised me were:-The incredible respect for privacy. The Japanese people are not the staring type. That is wrongly interpreted by some as avoiding eye contact and being unfriendly, When, in fact, it's the opposite. Just whenever I ask someone for directions, I see the big smile and the friendly behavior that makes me wanna bow my head in gratitude. -No Tips. Any shape or form is nonexistent. -Toilets!-Most Japanese use iphones. I mean, I was pretty sure I would see Sony&Sharp everywhere and those interesting flip smartphones. I even tried buying Sony, that I had to search for, but couldn't because it was SIM locked. It was kinda frustrating though, and I understood then why it's almost nonexistent brand where I live.So, what were the things that surprised you?"
"Amazingly tiny hotel rooms, carefully designed to fit all the important amenities into a small space. Good quality hotel rooms for as little as 4,000 yen.Polite and helpful staff anticipating my needs at hotels, stores, museums, everywhere! Even groups of drunk men on the street at night were polite. Loud clashing music from different sections of large retail spaces. Difficult address system. High standards of design everywhere. Even the shopping carts at Costco were perfectly arranged. Restaurants, stores, and banks with English names don't necessarily have English-speaking staff. Dejavu Fiberwig mascara--with thin-film technology, no more racoon eyes!A train system with frequent service, almost always on schedule, staffed by people who actually care about maintaining quality service."
"Toilets? Sure--washlets are great, but squatters are not. There are still a lot of them around. Also, surprising to see so many facilities without soap (or towels/hand dryers)Loud Clashing Music-yes, too much noise pollution in some stores, especially electronic ones. Really don't need to hear the same jingle every minute all day long. How can the employees stand it?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3aR-DnEcM8One enjoyable amenity-beer and chuhi vending machines at the hotel. Great.Edited: 10:10 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"Maybe you just didn't notice that liquid soap comes out when you bring your hands close to a square next to the water one. We are supposed to carry handerchieves or hand towels. You will only find paper towels at hotels or Kabukiza Theater.""-No Tips. Any shape or form is nonexistent. ""This is not true, either. You are supposed to tip Nakaisan at Ryokans etc. People who knows the rules smartingly hand gratuity."
"Most restrooms these days have the hand dryer. Places where I often find paper towels are restaurants.Shop jingles--yes. At places like Donki and Yodobashi, they play the same song all day. I am sure the employees have learned to block out the music."
"They have hand dryers, but to prevent the spread of COVID-19, you won't be able to use them in Japan these days."
"Washlet is a trademark of TOTO. LIXIL has Shower Toilet, and Panosonic has Beauty Toilet, respectively."
"For me it was :How polite / respectful everyone was, even when I didn't speak more than a few basic phrases everyone I met / spoke to was polite and tried their best to help out. Also did not get any weird stares or any behavior that made me feel uncomfortable or unwelcome as a foreigner.How clean the water was, what i mean by this is the water from the shower / sink in my hotel room made me feel WAY cleaner than the water here in california. I am unsure how to explain it but I just felt cleaner over all if it makes sense? Like when washing hair gel off my hands it just rinsed right out without any effort, compared to having to use a LOT of soap here.Convenience stores: the food way exceeded my expectations in terms of selection and the quality of it, it was just so good and fairly inexpensive. would rate 10/10Transportation / Train system : how easily it was to adapt and navigate, towards the end of my trip I was to the point where I almost didn't my phone to see GPS map for my destination. Color coded railways and numbering made it easy, not to mention there were a lot of signs in english as well as announcements.Vending Machines: Saw a lot of vending machines, almost on every corner which surprised me but there were usually a few different machines from different brands and a wide selection of drinks which were actually really good and fairly inexpensive. The other thing that surprised me about this was they had both a Hot and Cold selection for both food and drinks, which was very convenient.Tipping: I knew there was no tipping system but I had not realized how used to leaving a tip I was that I often found myself trying to leave a tip only to remember it's not accepted there. I even offered my cab driver (airport to hotel and vice versa) a tip for their fast and excellent transportation but was rejected.Maid Cafe's: Went to a Maid Cafe to see what it was about, and the Ladies / Staff were very friendly (i know its part of their job) but still made me feel welcome and made the experience great. They did singing shows from a variety of music selection (anime / pop / etc) and it was great.Store buildings with multiple floors- what i mean is the straight up buildings that have different floors for different things- such as movies, music, adult etc. Also the ones for anime / video games / collectibles.Arcades and Prize Games / Claw machines etc: Surprised by how full the arcades were, everyone just having a great time letting off steam. The crowd ranged from kids to business adults in suits which surprised me but it was good to see that you are not judged like here. In regards to the prize / claw games i was surprised by how good the people were at them, everywhere i looked people were winning prizes left and right, from small to huge prizes. I tried my luck and won some games but I paled in comparison to the skill of the rest of the people there. Was a great experience."
"Shoes on or off can vary country to country.IIn my home country, people take their shoes off when they enter a house. No one wears shoes in the house. They come off at the door and are put at the entrance way. I suspect our winter weather has something to do with that habit. The country I formerly lived in, everyone wore shoes in the house."
"Shoes off isn't exceptional in Asian countries, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, etc. Ondol heating room is very comfortable during winter season in South Korea. We take off shoes at the door entrance step. When I was in Singapore, we took off our shoes at the unit entrance as other locals did. It was common both in condo and HDB.Some locals also do it in HI. They inherit Asia life style a lot."
"#7 I think, each culture has it's own way of showing respect. Like wearing a hat inside a place or building might be considered in some cultures disrespectful. The same goes with wearing shoes. The foreigner you mentioned was looking at this as something confining his freedom and simply a drag, while for the Japanese it's merely good manners. I think the shoes off was originally for hygienic reasons though."
"#8 Thank you for sharing the things that surprised you. I gotta say, though, I never went to maid cafes, but the idea itself is weird and makes me somewhat uncomfortable. Maybe the experience itself is a bit different."
"@hfot2,since you mentioned about music, it reminds me of the melody roads when I drove along the Venus line in the highlands in Nagano Prefecture :)""Ode to Joy"" played along Venus Line.japantravelinsights.com/jp-2018-sept-nagano-â€¦"
