"i did Nhs test, got confirmation email with date and time and results in other email. Im not sure if private test done by post will work tho, the best is doing it in person, as its always might be lost in post or results came later then expected. I had mine in less then 24h."
I was trying to find out online if you get dates and email with NHS tests? It's all so confusing. Part of me wanted to cancel my holiday but can't as it's with ryanair
Did you just do via drive through and ask for email to confirm results? Sorry to ask but it’s all so confusing and there’s nothing from anyone to actually tell you what you’re to do thank you Sarah Tofts
post #5passengers with NHS test need to have 1. their NHS test appointment confirmation (72 hours begin with this) 2. the NHS COVID-19 Notification (negative result).
Thank you from what I’ve been able to find out you just book test and wait for email should be with you in about 24 hours
"Hi cazSo after chatting with a sister at Cambridge hospital basically we just book a test either drive through or at a pod via nhs site just make sure it’s not more than 72 hours before your flight also don’t forget your Cyprus flight passEdited: 11:24 am, August 11, 2020 "
When is everyone due to go to cyprus.. I’m due To go October And I’m a little bit worried about going
I’m going on September 30. Hopefully will get A NHS COVID test without any problems. It would be better if UK was moved to category A but I can’t see this happening. My holiday is with Jet2. To be honest I won’t be to disappointed if it gets cancelled.
How did u get a separate email with the date and time taken plz !!!!!?????
"Hi, how did u get an email with the date and time of your results? Got the negative text and email but nothing about when was taken going in a day !!!"
You just need the email that confirmed when your appointment was.
