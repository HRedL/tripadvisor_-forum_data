"We are doing a cross country road trip later on in the month and will be driving through/near Chicago. I know we are not responsible for the 14day quarantine since we are just passing through and not physically staying in the city, but we still wanted to stop in for a few hours and see a few things. My son is 10 and wants to see Cloud Gate- it is the number 1 thing on his list for the whole road trip. Does anyone have any other suggestions that we could possibly do and while still following social distancing rules?"
How long do you have? If you’re by cloud gate you could walk to buckingham fountain or down by the lake. Walk up to the river walk.
"I interpret it that you are affected by the Emergency Travel Order. If you are traveling cross country, it would be very easy to stay outside the city limits anyway. Let us know where you are coming from and where you are going, and we can provide some routes that would avoid the city. The states affected will be updated each week, so maybe Louisiana will be taken off the list by the time you travel.https:/…emergency-travel-order.html"
Chicago is actually way out of the way but he has it at the top of his list. So I am trying to work it In - we will be coming from St Louis to Chicago and then going west to Omaha (family is there) and then on to Mt Rushmore. I had thought about driving in early on Friday (the 17th) and staying outside of the city so we wouldn’t be breaking the city ordinances. If we do that we would potentially have the day we drive in and then the following day to do something else before continuing on. We could potentially stay 2 nights outside of the city if there was an abundance of things to do. Our dates aren’t set yet so I am open to any advice!
@IlliniTrav we are residents of Louisiana so we are currently on the list
Last time I was there it was blocked off. You could see it but you couldn't touch it or go under it.
Just curious... Where did you see that you don't need to quarantine if you are just passing through and not physically staying in the city? I've been looking and can't find anything that says that. Can anyone else clarify?

@ msmejkal- when were you last there? I read that that area was opened back up as of last week...? @IlliniTrav- I believe it was Forbes. Let me find the article and I’ll post it.
"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…@illinitrav - this isn’t the original article I saw but this one also talks about exceptions and has been shared numerous times in these Chicago Forums... “The order also does not apply to people who are at the airport for a connecting flight, or are driving through the city on their way elsewhere.”"
"Before we send tourists to see Buckingham Fountain, are we certain it has even been turned on this year? The Jaume Plensa fountain in Millennium Park has not, nor has the fountain in Lincoln Park near the Zoo.To the OP, you can see the Cloud Gate from a distance but, as mentioned above, it's roped off and you cannot walk up to it, under it or touch it, unfortunately. You could consider a River Cruise and/or walking along the RiverWalk with any additional time you may have here."
"Msmejkal is correct, the cloud gate is blocked off. You should believe Chicagoans, not something you read. Do not come to Chicago. Keep COVID in Louisiana. Stay out of Chicago until your home state has its pandemic under control and we can once again welcome visitors who respect our city rules. You should drive directly from St Louis to Omaha."
If you are visiting tourist sites then you are not driving through and need to quarantine. Don't stay in the suburbs and take day trips. There's a reason for the quarantine. Come another time.

"What msmejkal said. If you are from a state on the quarantine list, you shouldn't be sightseeing in Chicago."
"Hopefully you will get a chance to see it, however, Chicago is in stage 4 recovery and not quite ready for tourists. I believe you can walk through Millennium Park where Cloud 9 or “the bean” is located. Millennium Park is quite beautiful but social distancing is in effect. I believe Cloud 9 is roped off/barricaded so that folks can’t get too close to it unfortunately. Architecturally Chicago is stunning. I love driving down Lake Shore Drive to view the lake, the skyscrapers, the museums and Soldier Field, home of Da Bears. A drive on Michigan Avenue is nice or anywhere you can view the buildings just to get a feel of the city. Since you are going to Mount Rushmore I hope they are finished with the renovations. It was a bit disappointing last fall because much of it was blocked off. Do consider going to Custer State Park nearby if you haven’t already. The 18 mile wildlife loop is worth seeing with all the bison and other animals there. We enjoyed that much more than Mount Rushmore. Safe travels."
"I just want to reiterate what posters no. 12 and 14 said. Please don’t try to end run the quarantine if your state is on the list. There is a reason why travelers from LA need to quarantine for 2 weeks. See the most recent LA data, https:/…. You may be infected, but asymptomatic. Please don’t bring the virus here.Edited: 5:40 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"It is a bad time to come to Chicago. Quarantine and all. Very, very strict mask rules. Social distancing everywhere and lots and lots of things are not open. Including many hotels. There is a reason for this. As nasty as it sounds. No one wants people from your state (and others) here. We have worked too hard to get our Covid19 numbers under control. B."
Stay away. What don't you get about Covid-19 restrictions. Our restrictions apply to you.
"Sorry guys- I thought I posted a couple of days ago, but maybe it didn’t go through.Thanks for all of the input and advice, we have decided to skip over Chicago and redo our plans to locations that are open to LA residents. Hopefully if Chicago is open in the fall we can visit then! I hope all of y’all are staying safe!"
Thanks for bypassing Chicago. IMO It is nicer in the fall anyway.B.
"""I believe you can walk through Millennium Park where Cloud 9...""I'm doing fine on Cloud 9, but I believe it's called Cloud Gate."
"FLWfan from Vista California, of course you are correct but 2 pages of answers from Chicagoans knew what the OP was asking about without correcting her. You are correct that the sculptures real title is “cloud gate” but we call it “The Bean”. We tended, it seems, as to why the OP was traveling to Chicago in the time of COVID-19. Coming from Calif. you understand this.Edited: 11:45 pm, July 15, 2020 "
