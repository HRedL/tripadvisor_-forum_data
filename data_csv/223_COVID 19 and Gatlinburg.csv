I know that different areas in Sevier County and Tennessee are affected at different stages of the virus. Can anyone advise me on the severity in Gatlinburg at this time?
"I was just looking at the current counts for Sevier County which contains Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, and Sevierville. The COVID-19 cases continue to climb in Tennessee's gateway county to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As of July 22, the total count of positive cases in the county is 1,174. Known active cases: 323. The county's hospital, LeConte Medical Center, has only 79 beds."
"There are currently only 43 hospitalizations. The number of active cases has been fairly steady for several days.This is a good website for the latest info....https:/…press-releases.htmlEdited: 8:58 am, July 23, 2020 "
"This gives more details but nothing specific for Gatlinburg, just Sevier County...https:/…"
"Gatlinburg’s zip code is 37738 (Sevierville’s: 37764, 37862, 37864, 37876. Pigeon Forge: 37863, 37868). If you will click on Recent Trends by Zip Code, and choose East TN, you can see trends by zip code here https:/…maps.htmlSee Post 269 of this Thread for more information if you’re interested: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60842…Sevier County has a press release each day with cumulative cases, active cases, negative tests, hospitalization & deaths since the beginning. They have a rolling update, so it’s easy to compare from day to day: https:/…press-releases.html While overall cases are rising, active cases as of yesterday have actually decreased since July 3 due to recoveries (although admittedly there is a very long backlog for results). I hope that helps!"
"One thing to note about COVID-19 recoveries:The number of recoveries is encouraging, but with regard to COVID-19, the definition of ""recovered"" only means that the patient has tested negative for the virus twice. It does not mean that the patient has recovered to their previous normal health. The timeframe for full recovery can take much longer."
"I have been traveling for over 30 years, to Gatlinburg and parts of this great country. I can tell you beware of the numbers, areas are reporting multiple positive test, hospitals are reporting Covid cases when Covid is NOT present in the patient. Case in point, Doctor fired from hospital for refusing to state that Covid was an underlying reason for an ER visit by a patient who went with a broken foot, gun shoot victims are being reported as Covid case, don’t believe everything the Government is telling you. Hospitals are getting money from the Government for every Covid case they report and there is no checks and balances to ensure the reporting is correct. It baffles me that for a county with a population of almost 1000,000 people and that see almost over a million a year and only the one hospital, that poor planning. Also, the numbers seem a little skewed, 1174 positive cases with 323 active case. What is the purpose of separating the two, when you have 1174 total cases in the county with last know count of only 4 deaths. That is based on population 1.2% positive cases and .003% death rate. I would say that’s damn good compared to other places."
"RetiredGovEmp,The purpose of giving the different totals is to keep track of how many cases there have been since the beginning of record keeping on this, and how many cases are currently active, how many have recovered. I think it’s extremely helpful to know this information."
"Ok, but don’t you think they should have also stated what happened to the other 851 cases, which included the 4 deaths. Now did the rest of the 847 cases recover or something else. There is a big difference between positive and active cases especially when only 43 were hospitalized since the beginning of the outbreak. Even if you go back to June when they started reporting the hospitalizations still good numbers. Your health dept admits it’s counting possible Covid case due to other risk factors the person may have even if they tested negative."

Wasn’t anecdotal and wasn’t a misdiagnosis the patient had a broken foot not a the virus.
I wouldn’t really concern myself with the case count in gatlinburg or severe county since most people you’re going to be around are tourists and nobody knows where they came from.. I think there’s a lot better chance to catch from them than locals
"I agree and I think most of them will check the requirements before coming. You will always have those others. It there are some local that think that Gatlinburg should shut down, personally I think that would cause more problems than the virus."
"I would almost assure you that the rise in cases since Memorial Day was not community spread among locals, but was due to the virus being brought to the area by visitors who were either asymptomatic or were in the incubation phase of the virus.We are facing the same problem in Nashville in the tourist district, the visitors are coming, infecting those who live and work there and then leaving.It's pointless to argue whether a positive case was or wasn't COVID-19. Mistakes happen, but the number of possible misdiagnosed cases as a whole is negligible and not worthy of dismissing the entire pandemic. If 100 people stare at the sun for 5 minutes and 99 are blinded, it's silly to say because 1 person wasn't, then staring at the sun won't cause blindness."
"It’s very presumptive of you blaming the visitors for being the cause in the rise of cases without any data. Especially since a lot of visitors also come from within the State. I can understand mistakes happen between Covid and the flu, but how can you say it’s a mistake between a broken foot or gun shot wound and Covid."
"RetiredGovEmp,Just take a look at the aforementioned Sevier County Press Releases. On the Thursday before Memorial Day, May 21, there was ONE active case in Sevier County. Sevier County had smashed the curve and their case count was one of the lowest in the state by that point.As others have mentioned, with the multiple thousands of visitors to Sevier County per week, who knows what is coming in and out, as the public statistics are only for Sevier County residents. May we all do our part!Edited: 2:34 pm, July 23, 2020 "
So I fact there could have been a lot of cases in the county just not known due to the lack of testing available for all.

"The thing you have to consider here is that individuals from out of town who visit and test positive, either before or after their trip, do not count in Sevier County. They count where they live."
"A lot of new cases have been attributed to travel. I think it wise to self quarantine if you travel at this time. If you are not able to allow the extra time for self quarantine, then postpone your trip for a safer time. Just my opinion.Stay safe."
"Where I currently reside, we have been under a stay at home situation for beginning in March. When I must, I visit the grocer where all must wear face masks to enter. This is not to guarantee anything as I consider the disinfection to be more important than the breathing restriction with masks. I will continue to visit this site until the time I could make the journey in the coming Spring. Hopefully I will be able to make the visit. I will interpret the validity of the current information for me personally, and this will only let me know if the situation is better or worse than the previous month, if this info is available."

"We were in Gatlinburg on 19th and 20th of July. Many people did not seem to be aware of the ongoing Covid19 epidemic and did not seem to take any precautions at all....no masks, no social distancing, eating inside of crowded restaurants.... The place is fantastic but you need to be careful there"
"That was our experience in July as well. So we limited our outings to hiking the less crowded trails, Publix and Lowe’s. We own a cabin in Sevierville so we are there every month. Our home is in Florida where we are finally seeing more compliance with the safety guidelines."
"This is what has us on the fence to keep our trip (Aug 16-20). My family has been looking forward to this trip since having to cancel at spring break. Our primary plan is to hike and we don't plan to eat anywhere indoors, but still....I do want to come home with my annual vacation sweatshirt ;). We will minimize exposure to ourselves and to others but there is still a much greater risk of contracting the virus there than if we stayed home where we have experienced relatively minimal virus activity. Decisions, decisions."
"Lisa, the one advantage to those dates will be a lot of schools will be back in session. There will likely be much less human traffic in town and in the national park, at least during the week. Weekends will probably still be busy."
"Yes there is definitely risk of exposure if you travel. A lot of those risks can be cut down by planning ahead. We are coming in early September and are doing our homework before coming.Yes I’ve seen the videos of huge crowds with very few masks. People crowded into restaurants, and the lines of cars along the popular trailheads. People are crowding into all the attractions. Which is why will NOT be eating out or visiting those places.We plan on bringIng our groceries with us to avoid the food stores. Frozen water bottles keeps food very cold for days. It is a vacation and yes we will order food but as takeout to enjoy in our condo or at a picnic area. Our days will be spent exploring the park in our car driving or on quiet trails were we will have our masks if we need them. I have containers of wipes and cans of Lysol to disinfect our condo and any picnic table we use.No it will not be the vacation we planned last January but I believe we can still have a good trip.I know everyone has gotten so judgmental on people who travel. I really wish people would stop that. This is a travel sight and people are afraid to ask questions because they are being told not to come.I am coming for a much needed break. I work in a dental office where obviously people can’t have masks on when we are working on them. The stress level of worrying about being exposed despite all of our precautions is very real. I am sure that many others on here have their own reasons as well. It is very stressful in so many medical professions right now, that yes we need to look at those beautiful mountains and breathe in that fresh air without our masks that we wear all day to keep you safe.I wish everyone safe travels and please wear your mask to protect the wonderful people who call the smoky mountains home. They should not have to risk their health because you feel a mask is uncomfortable. I wear one every day for 8 hours, an hour or two doesn’t seem to much to ask."
"We were there for 4 nights in mid July and managed to stay away from people pretty well. There is some parts of the National Park that are very remote where we saw very few people, the Cataloochee area in particular which is in the more NE part of the National Park.We mostly cooked at the cabin, did take out a couple of times and did eat two meals out with different comfort levels as far as safety measures go."
"#30 Lisa, don't be on the fence. Go. Enjoy. Take the precautions you feel you need to, but also relax and have fun. We're all so stressed out these days, the mental health break will be wonderful! :)"
Checking back to see if anyone knows whether Sevier County and Gatlinburg has flattened the curve concerning COVID-19? I’ve noticed where tourism is starting to pick up. I believe I’ve seen where the mask mandate has been extended until the end of the month!
"Bill, tourism is the same or a little heavier than usual. East Tennessee in general has not flattened the curve. It is still suggested to follow the core preventative actions such as distancing, mask wearing, frequent hand washing, etc. There's not a lot of that going on, however. We've got some counties who initially refused a mask mandate who are finally putting them in place, so hopefully things will start to smooth out some. And, it does matter what ""surrounding"" counties do in re: to Sevier County - many, many people travel back and forth from Sevier County for shopping and dining (and vice versa) so the virus doesn't behave differently in one county than a neighboring. The mask mandate in Sevier County has indeed been extended to August 29, for public indoor areas / businesses."
"Bill T,The daily press releases from Sevier County update statistics each day, and the page is organized for a quick view of the day to day counts. https:/…press-releases.html"
"""We've got some counties who initially refused a mask mandate who are finally putting them in place, so hopefully things will start to smooth out some.""Which counties are you referring to? I haven't seen any in the nearby area other than Sevier having a mandate, other than Knox. Don't think Blount nor Cocke have one."
