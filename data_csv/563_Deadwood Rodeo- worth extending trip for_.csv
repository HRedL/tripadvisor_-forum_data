"I'm traveling through with my 3 older kids in July. My plan is to travel from Yellowstone to Devils Tower on the first day. So Tuesday morning would be Devils Tower, drive Spearfish Falls/Trail/Canyon to Deadwood. Settle in and do the 8pm show that night in town. Wednesday do Adams House, Mt Roosevelt, the Gold Mine, maybe Tatanka...so this is where my question comes in...is it worth lingering to go to the Rodeo Wednesday night? If we do, it's Mt Rushmore/Crazy Horse, to Custer Thursday. Thursday evening/Friday morning drive the CSP roads. Friday head to Hot Springs for the Mammoth site then hit the Badlands before I hike it quickly back to Indiana by Saturday afternoon. If we skip the rodeo, I'd go to Custer Wednesday night, probably hitting Mt Rushmore Wednesday afternoon. So Thursday would be more of CSP, maybe down to Hot Springs then stay down there or closer to the Badlands...speaking of, if we did this option, I think I would miss sunrise/sunset but I wouldn't be so rushed in driving back."
"I personally have not seen the rodeo, but I wouldn't extend a trip for any rodeo, as I have no interest. Sometimes I think it's easier to not have such a rushed drive back home and be able to break it up more, as it's my preferred method. However, everyone is different. If you run short on time, I personally would also skip the Mammoth Site in favor of more time in the Badlands (i.e. sunrise/sunset)."
"I guess the rodeo is still scheduled but I wonder how Covid-19 will effect it. Social distancing, masks, who knows?"
"There was a rodeo going on in Wall when we were there a couple of weeks ago, no masks, about a hundred people there in the afternoon. But that was then and things change daily..."
With so much scenery I thought the Mammoth Site would be good to throw my not-as-adventurous 11yo boy a bone of interest before the long drive back. Is it worth a stop? I’m confident by this point in the trip I won’t get them up for sunrise but I may be able to catch sunset the last night at badlands.
My kids (and we adults) thought the Mammoth Site was excellent. I think the guides make a conscious effort to include the children in the presentation when possible. Our kids were able to hold a large replica mammoth bone during the talk and they thought that was cool.
"If you can make it work to see a sunset in the Badlands, then I would opt to make the stop at the Mammoth Site, particularly if your son enjoys fossils. I didn't mean to imply the site wasn't worthwhile. I haven't had the chance to do sunrise/sunset in the Badlands, and it's on my bucket list for next time we visit. I think that's why I was making it a priority.Our daughter had a similar experience to what Longhorn describes when we toured. She enjoyed it as well."
"The mammoth site is excellent, really well done and super interesting."
