"Hi allI added a post to the Causes Forum (https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g1-…) encouraging people to post reviews in TA to highlight those operators who have responded, in these extraordinary times, positively (COVID-19 Heroes) to their clients or negatively (COVID-19 Profiteer). I have added a ""COVID-19 Hero"" review for the Millennium Dubai Airport Hotel, which allowed us to cancel our non-refundable reservation (for a booking in October) without question. I would encourage all TA-ers to do the same - especially the COVID-19 heroes - these establishments deserve to be highlighted so they can benefit from their generosity when things eventually turn around.CheersMark"
"Thank you Shaun - I hope every TA-er agrees with you, and those, that interact with a provider during this difficult time, post a review to reflect the positive/negative outcome."
"Unfortunately I disagree, Shaun ... While I accept that some people lodge negative reviews for ludicrous reasons, TripAdvisor is about reporting both the good and the bad. It is up to the reader to decide on a) the credibility of the poster (e.g. is it their first and only review? have others reported in the same vain?) and b) the validity of the negative review (e.g. because staff in a hotel in China speak 'poor English' - according to the reviewer, that does not make it a bad hotel).However, I am seeing many reports in booking.com community forums, of people who have had to cancel 'non refundable' reservations, due to travel bans in their country, and the hotel has refused to give them a refund - totally disregarding these extraordinary circumstances. Such hotels deserve to be called for their 'Covid-19 Profiteering' and I have encouraged people to do so via TA.I, for one, would definitely want to know if an establishment showed no compassion for its clients during this time - it would certainly give me pause to really consider if I wanted to give them my business. Similarly, if I see a 'Covid-19 Hero' review in my search for a hotel, I will give serious and deserved consideration to booking with them.Edited: 8:52 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"PS Meanwhile, take care and stay healthy, Shaun. I look forward to hitting you up for some Dubai tips when hopefully we head there some time in the future"
"The issue I’d have is there can be a tendency for people to post blaming others without looking at themselves first, or the case objectively. Sometimes people don’t know what they’ve booked, or their rights, or they are economical with the facts and jump to the “it’s someone else that’s to blame” then write a less than fair review or post than disappear. Sometimes people want to get it off their chest rather than find a resolution.For instance, people booking non-refundable travel or with shonky agents or websites have a choice - often a poor or uninformed one granted - and thus, they’re at the mercy of the provider for a goodwill gesture.Call out bad service or people not playing by the rules by all means, but only if the poster is fair, reasonable and completely without fault and that saves readers having to make their own minds up.If an OTA is offering a concession on non-refundable rates, that’s a plus for them - they’ve (generally) no obligation to do so.If an OTA offers a concession but doesn’t go out it, call them out. Take Emirates for instance; they could be considered a hero and a profiteer. ^ Before the FCO changed their advice they were offering amending bookings even in non-changeable fare types = hero.* After FCO changed advice & EK cancelled flights, they won’t honour passenger rights to a refund and instead offer vouchers which could be refunded but only after a year = zero. * After EK have been advised they will be bailed out with a cash injection, still not honouring refunds = profiteer.There’s a big difference in profiteering and providers sticking to their rights, but all I’d say is anyone posting needs to be fair, honest, reasonable and objective.Edited: 12:59 am, April 02, 2020 "
"Mark, you're right about BookingCom - there was a thread here a couple of weeks back ago BookingCom not honouring their ""Forced Circumstances' refund, saying it was the landlord that wasn't agreeing not them. It's not ideal really to see they have no measures in place to cover this, but after all is said and done. it's down to the traveller to make the decision to risk non-refundable bookings.Edited: 5:22 am, April 02, 2020 "
"Yes Shaun, you are absolutely right - in normal circumstances ... but these are extraordinary circumstances ... nobody could have predicted a health crisis that would affect world-wide travel and impact the livelihoods of a substantial part of the travelling community. So I do accept I, and others like me, accepted a lower rate on a non-refundable tariff - but why are some hotels (many of which are small family run operations) accepting that the circumstances still warrant a refund, while large multi-national chains (like the hotel to which I referred in Munich) are obstinately applying the letter of the law? While I might consider not writing a 'profiteer' review for a smaller hotel, I will not resile from condemning large chains which put profits before decency.Phew - thus endeth my sermon ... sorry blood boiling a bit there ... time for bed :)Edited: 8:04 am, April 02, 2020 "
"No worries Mark, all discourse is good and it's worth seeing and reading different views, thoughts and opinions.I'm hardly one to stick up for the other side, but it's unprecedented for everyone and it's not at all clear who are going to come out of the other side and stay in business, hence my hope any opinions, reviews and suchlike are balanced, objective and fair.Which multi-national chain/which Munich hotel are you referring to BTW? From what I've seen, most of the main chains are being pretty forthcoming, although the issue could be complicated further when third parties become involved."
"Shaun, at this stage, I'm only prepared to say that the hotel, in my case, belongs to one of the larger chains in the Accor group. As you say, opinions and reviews need to be balanced and I don't want to 'name and shame' them in an open forum yet, as there is plenty of time for them to give me a refund before I will actually lose money. Having said that, I won't be giving them a 'Covid-19 Hero' review if they do give me a refund, as their current attitude is not deserving of such praise - rather I will say nothing, in deference to the fact they eventually saw (my subjectivity here) ""reason"".Currently, Accor (like most of the larger chains) are offering vouchers to those affected by Covid-19, including anyone who has a 'non-refundable' booking. In my communications with this particular hotel, they have said, 'no cancellation booking - therefore no refund, no change of date, no voucher'. Your statement re '... BookingCom not honouring their ""Forced Circumstances"" refund' definitely piqued my interest - I'm going to look into that further, for as you will not be surprised to hear, BookingCom have totally disavowed any responsibility for bookings made through their site and are putting it totally back on to the hotel.Finally - re Emirates. QANTAS are doing similar with vouchers (and not not openly offering refunds), but at least they are giving customers until Dec 2021 to use their vouchers. They are another provider we have approached for a refund - we won't be using 'our flights' until Sep 2022. In the case of QANTAS, I expect them to be more understanding, as our Federal Govt has just handed a large sum of tax-payers' money to Australian-owned airlines to 'help sustain them' in the coming months.Definitely appreciating your balanced perspective in these unprecedented times."
"What is the specific reason you’re looking for a refund?That may be a factor in their stance perhaps? Whilst it’s a dynamic and fast-moving situation, it could be possible there are a range of factors impacting travel but clarity does help - especially if BookingCom are only exempting particular ones.Here’s is the link >>>https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/help/legal…If you search back in this forum (or maybe the Dubai one) the thread title included “Forced Circumstance’ I think. However, the OP in that case wasn’t explicit in his case and some facts seemed to waiver as the thread developed to make the story seem a little more complex. They’d chatted to BookingCom who claimed they would give a refund but the landlord refused.Regarding your Munich hotel, is it booked through Accor or BookingCom? Ultimately it’s down to the policy of who you booked with but it’s always worth keeping patient and trying for an escalation, or different channel. One alternative could be - not ideal, but maybe better - is if you explain that you can’t avail of the voucher or rebooking, ask if you can make a booking on their site for a friend for similar value then get your cash back?"
"We have cancelled our Sep/Oct trip now because of the decision by the Oberammergau Passion Play committee to cancel their season until 2022. While we are expecting that in Australia some travel restriction will still be in place in Sep, who knows what it will be like? - but our Prime Minister is suggesting we should expect a disruption to normal life for at least 6 months. We had only just started to plan and make arrangements for our trip, so had only made a few bookings. So, essentially we have cancelled because of the uncertainty of the situation.We booked the Munich hotel through BookingCom as 'non-refundable' because our air fare has us in Munich on that day - so obviously we had no reason to expect a refund ... and if we had to cancel for drastic personal reasons, we'd be covered by our travel insurance. Unfortunately, our travel insurance (probably all policies?) has a specific exclusion for ""... any interference with your travel plans by any government, government regulation or prohibition or intervention or official authority."" - e.g. a govt. imposed travel ban.But, as you say, it's early days for us so I will bide my time and drop the matter with the hotel until closer to the date when the situation for Sep is clearer."
