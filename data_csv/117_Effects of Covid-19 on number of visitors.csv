"am due to visit Orlando in April/May this year from UK. Nothing will stop me going bar my flight being cancelled, but I was pondering it. With the people of China and Italy not travelling, and a lot of people choosing not to travel or visit crowded places, will we be expecting the parks to be quieter? For those who arent concerned, this could be the best time to visit!"
"Every cloud has a silver lining it seemsEdited: 4:58 pm, March 01, 2020 "
Too soon to tell
We were at AK today and it was jammed packed. I'd say its too early as well.
Of course Disney may just shut down entirely.
"Unless we have a huge outbreak in Florida, I would expect it to be more crowded than usual. As temperatures rise into the 80's in April and May in Florida, the virus should become less infectious, just like colds and flu. It could be a safer place to travel to than many other places in the world. Maybe people from some countries will have a harder time getting into the US, but so far that doesn't seem like the case. We'll be traveling outside of the US for much of that time, but not to anyplace that's currently out of control. No one knows what will happen by then. We'll be going unless our flights are cancelled.Edited: 6:44 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Crowds at the US parks won't diminish unless our economy literally hits another recession. Flu and stomach bug outbreaks don't keep folk from Disney, neither will this virus."
Nope. You’ll find it just as busy. Only way it won’t be is that the economic impact of the reaction to this flu virus is so great significant recession sets in. That and airlines no longer have staff or funds to keep flying.
Just canceled our March trip to Disney/Universal. Seems like the worst place to visit for ourselves and our community. We can always rebook.
"Shouldn't you be more concerned about what is going on in your own backyard?!Edited: 4:33 pm, March 02, 2020 "
I don’t believe any one person has the right to tell anyone else what they need to be concerned aboutEveryone has the right to do what they feel is best for themselves and their family
"Annonymous9527 - Thank you for that illuminating reply, I am actually not concerned at all about Corona Virus at all, the chances of being effected (in my area) currently are low and I maintain good hygiene. I was merely querying whether the parks were likely to see a reduce in visitors, out of pure curiosity. Good luck to you and I hope your backyard remains healthy.Edited: 5:11 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"My response was based on the Seattle person cancelling, not you. 6 people have died there. No one has died in Florida. I have no idea what the U.K. Situation is. I am proceeding with my Florida trip this weekend. Unfortunately it will probably be too soon for me to see reduced crowds. Maybe my April trip will benefit."
"Ah, well thats different then. Thank you for that reply, I understand now. We will be continuing plans until told otherwise, I feel the disruption may come from cancelled flights as BA started the proceedings this evening by cancelling flights to New York based on low ticket sales. So, time will tell!! Let us know how your trip went, I will be interested to hear!"
"I’ve been tracking hotel prices in Orlando for our visit in a couple weeks. Suddenly, late today there’s some nice deals popping up on the same day Florida declares a state of emergency. Looks like somebody thinks incentives are in order to keep up bookings.More cases are going to be discovered in FL. The testing so far has been laughable. Just based on the numbers there is a good chance somebody with this illness has already been to WDW. So yeah, bookings are going to go down as more bad news comes out. Just a question of how quick and steep that curve is."
I am going in 4 days. Not concerned right now. I have been taking Elderberry syrup and now taking Vitamin C and echinacea.I do not see this spreading as much but we'll see. Good hygiene makes a big difference.
Elderberry syrup echinacea and vit c and zinc are not helpful. Please don’t encourage those.
No brainer. Of course it will have an impact. Hoping by 2021 it will have all blown over.
October I respectfully disagree. This was told to me by an ER doctor I respect. You do not believe building your immune system will help?Are you a doctor?

"More worried about pack closure and what reimbursement would be. I've got the whole holiday package through Disney, so if parks closed fingers crossed I will get it all refunded... but if just the parks and not hotel are shut... what happens then? No point in this holiday without the park, but will they agree?"
"I share the same concerns with blackwhite85: you can buy Disney tickets a day before you go, but what about my flights? The resort reservation?"
"I also contest that elderberry, zinc, and vit c ""do nothing."" Of course they do; we are just laymen that can't measure our own immune system's robustness."
"Try to pack lunches and snacks the less people touching your food the better. Food industry workers generally don't get sick leave and are not paid well enough that they can just stay home. I wonder if the people who rode out the hurricanes in the resort have any input on how Disney handled compensation for park closures. Disney trips are not cheap and it would be heartbreaking not to be able to go after all the planning, so this is a valid worry."
"I doubt very much WDW, Universal and Seaworld will shut down over this virus. Unless there is a significant outbreak which in Florida's climate is doubtful. Anyone that is panicking just now about it needs to chill out. It is very early stages especially in the US. We are due to fly out in October and I have no doubt whatsover that this will all blow over well before then."
"Blackwhite85 - I think this is where you need to ensure you have robust travel insurance, and ask whats covered. I have the same queries, but I'm assuming WDW and the other parks will be understanding. Also, most of the tickets are valid for quite a while as long as they arent used, so if it were possible to rebook you could just keep them until then."
"preid90, funny story; on the weekend I was posting and thinking in a couple months, when this virus hits FL then we need to worry. Turned out a couple months was tomorrow and the spread is really unknown because the US gov limited testing so much. Yeah, I guess that’s not actually a funny story.Edited: 9:53 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Well, Tokyo Disney is closed for a couple of weeks. If infection cases in FL reach a certain level I expect all parks will get closed, it all gets down to how bad the number of cases get and whether the government orders closures as has been happening in Italy. We are going to Orlando in May unless the parks are closed.Edited: 2:31 am, March 04, 2020 "
"This virus doesn’t like the heat. I’m hoping that once warmer temps come and stay, it will be gone by August when we go."
"I hope a lot sooner, we are there next month."
"Im leaving on Friday for Disney. So far it ""seems"" to be spreading slowly but as some have said, those with mild symptoms may not seek out a doctor. Guess time will tell. I feel ok about going but can you see my ripping out my Lysol wipes on every ride and seat we sit in? Seems overkill doesn't it?"
Overkill? Maybe. But will it hurt?
Lysol wiping your ride seat/bars/whatever will do very little. It takes 4 minutes to disinfect fully. Youre probanly better off just sanitizing your hands immediately after.
"Live in Seattle and believe me once -people are dying and numbers of cases go up daily, things slow down.If several hundred cases appear in the Orlando area WDW may be closing their parks like they did in China and Japan.Luckily younger kids not getting the virus as much or have mild reaction.It is just getting started"
Disney isn’t the majority owner of the Asian parks so they don’t have control over closings. Unless forced to I highly doubt they would close the parks here or in California. https:/…
"My workplace has banned any work related travel until May 1. Domestic and International So this may decrease attendance at conferences in Orlando that offer the chance to attend a conference and visit the parks, or have family visit the parks. Who knows if this will be noticeable in crowd levels."
"I have heard of companies canceling work related conventions, etc. I think you will see numbers down of those traveling in general but not all. I have 2 separate friends who flew to UK this week, one with his family. I think most will cancel trips to Italy for now. I would not go there either with the unknowns. DIVoc Interesting you mention boosting the immune system which i have done. In Target last night they had a huge shelf of their own brand immune tablets and the entire huge shelf was empty. I have heard of Costcos where people are buying huge amounts of water and toilet paper. I think some people are going overboard."
"Well, assuming parks will stay open, I will have one more with me to Orlando later on this month as older DD’s spring break trip to Quebec just got cancelled. Thank goodness for CFAR insurance clause - highly recommend! On the plus side, I haven’t seen airfare to MCO this low in a long time! $54 per way nonstop on Southwest, $48 on AA."
"susieb. I totally agree with you! Why on earth are some people stocking up on bottled water??!!Are the taps going to run dry?Whoops. Missed your earlier post Mike!Edited: 2:10 pm, March 06, 2020 "
Yes they may. Houston lost all clean water due to massive water main break just last week. About 3 million people affected Freaked everyone out and bottled water was hard to find. Now everyone in Houston is stocking up. But we have to anyways for the hurricanes.
Susie those are the kind of people who would jump in front of women and children on the titanic!Went to Disney Springs today. Worker at one restaurant told me they can see a difference this week.My hotel does not feel busy at all.Did have to search a bit to find a dinner rez near the boardwalk.Epcot tomorrow. Will let you know how it goes.
"Just coming to the end of our time in Orlando. If the crowds in Disneyworld are less now because of Coronavirus, I dread to think how bad they are normally! Everywhere has been packed solid."
Was packed at Epcot yesterday.You'd never know Coronavirus was a worry.only saw one person in Orlando airport wearing a mask.It is not a worry for tourists except for companies canceling conventions. That has to be a huge hit for Disney hotels and parks but you wouldn't know it by the crowds.
"Interesting... We left last night, 7 March, and felt we had some of the most manageable crowds we have encountered over 5+ visits in the last 15 months. Our 8 day stay saw some heavy crowds on Wed at DHS for the opening on MMRR, and Epcot for Flower and Garden but otherwise didn’t notice the crowds much. Never got in a standby line over 20 minutes (except MMRR)."
"Our trip isn't until 2021 so things should be back to normal by then (whatever that is) That said, if I had a trip scheduled this year, I would still go."
We just got back and loved it. Unless people start dropping like flies in the Orlando area I wouldn't be too worried about it.
"Well, this has escalated far beyond what I imagined! Universal and WDW closing for the foreseeable is a massive blow, my trip isnt until end of April but I'm not holding out much hope!"
"I would hold off cancelling for now. things could change for the better, but please don't underestimate anything. Just keep watching the news for any new info."

"While I am not as enthusiastic as Warren, I don't disagree. Even the most financially stable company can't withstand extended closures. There will have to be a middle ground at some point in the next few weeks where we continue to live but with extra precautions. Otherwise the economy will collapse."
"The name of this virus is COVID-19, not the “Chinese Virus”."
"I agree, really Warren?"

"Wondering if the parks will be quieter?People need to start wondering whether or not Disney Corp is going to survive.Disney just released a new corporate projection; many of their chief revenue streams have now become negatives. Operations in theme parks, cruise ships, theatrical production, are all frozen. Their stock price is tumbling and they are a cash poor company. I expect they will be bought out or get a bailout.https://blogmickey.com/2020/03/disney-warns-…The other important factor is the progression of the virus in FL. A 34 year old man just died in California from complications from the virus. He was diagnosed shortly after a visit to a conference at WDW in early March. As many have suspected, including me, the virus has been present at WDW for a long time.https:/…Which leads into the next point, the FL virus response has been and continues to be terrible. Testing program remains stunningly deficient. Imho the Governor and other officials have done this in part purposefully to protect the tourism business.https:/…coronavirus-florida-desantis.amp.html So effect of the virus on visitors will be there will be no visitors for a long time.Edited: 4:11 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Yarbogash - Could you please check the date of posts, before leaving condescending messages. The original post was written before any this was considered an International Crisis. There was no mention of flights being cancelled or parks closing at the time. Clearly we are far removed from that now, and the climate is very different and does not reflect the orignal post."
"Tenni, ?!? This from the person who just posted that the economy might collapse?Whatever. Love ya. Always good to hear from you. Posted links just for you. Interesting you don’t let facts get in the way of your rant. I guess that’s not what it was about with you after all.And to the op, did not mean to be condescending. It was more directed to on going discussions than your first post. Apologies for how it came off. As I wrote that post I thought wow, this is kinda dark. But it is honest."
"And just so nobody is confused, from the NYT article I linked to:‘ A disease that is deadly to the elderly and easily spread by the young has left Florida especially vulnerable. Yet faced with the prospect of dealing a shattering blow to an $86 billion tourism industry, Gov. Ron DeSantis has moved more slowly than some other states to contain a pandemic that is spreading with alarming speed. Whole swaths of the state have yet to begin robust testing, according to State Department of Health data. And even as some of the beaches still swarmed with college revelers, the state refused to close them.’Testing in FL has been consistently lagging, and even when the cdc relaxed the criteria for who could get the test FL refused to adopt the expanded criteria. So no, the response in Florida has not been like every other state."
Disney survived John Carter and Mars Needs Moms. They can survive this.

"Mike-c, heh I’m in an evidence driven business and the evidence is usually not pretty. So maybe you are right. And I actually pulled my punches here. If you get a chance read the tmz article I posted. Look at the timeline and think about what that means. Who knew what when. That can give you some really dark ideas."
Tenni all states have not reacted equally . Here is a nice article showing which states have reacted how quickly. They are ranked. 1 is most aggressive.https:/…My state is in the bottom 5. Florida in the lower half ranked 37
"Yarbogash - I actually appreciated that comment! Thanks for acknoledging it wasnt based on my original post, I actually agree with the rest of what you said now you've clarified its aimed at the current situation. You might just be right... but dont tell the others I said that..."
"Ok, looking at the timeline. Disney announced parks closing on 3/12, this test came back positive on 3/13, WDW closed on 3/15. Was his conference at Disney? Did he stay at one of the Disney resorts? If so, which one? A lot more info needed here.Re Disney’s survival, the company has a sufficiently diversified revenue to weather the storm for some time. And with Chapek at the helm, I can’t think of a better person who knows how to generate investor confidence and profits once this nightmare is over.I agree with you on the lack of testing and Florida’s delayed response. As difficult as these closures are, it appears to be the only way to “flatten the curve” right now. And it goes without saying - the longer this nightmare goes on, the bigger its economic impact will be."
California governor orders all residents to stay home. Not quite what Florida governor is ordering. Those spring break photos were scary. All states are not doing the same thing.
"Floria’s Governor has made some very bad calls. Leaving the beaches open has sent the message it’s ok to visit. Even yesterday, loads of visitors were checking into hotels here In Key West and crowding the Main Street and County and State Beaches. Thankfully our County leaders have finally stepped up and effective Saturday night all hotels, vacation rentals and campgrounds are closed and all visitors must leave."
I wish California’s governor could be our president. We need a very firm hand during this global crisis.
"I've booked a trip from Orlando to Gatwick for late April and very much doubt that the UK will be accepting US tourists by then, or the reverse. I also doubt that Orlando's theme parks will have re-opened. Due to lack of testing, no one knows how many Florida residents are infected. A smart thermometer website ominously suggests there's lots of fevers. https://healthweather.us/The state has many people without health insurance (and very poor access to charity care), many more with poor health insurance, and weak public health departments that have been cut back in recent years to fund state tax cuts. Some hospitals are extraordinarily well run and may actually have adequate supplies for the impending crisis. In terms of the overall economy, Disney is an enormously successful corporation and should be able to fend for itself. I wonder whether Universal might have to slow its ambitious expansion plans. Sea World is probably in trouble. Expansion of Orlando International Airport with a new South Terminal is fully financed and so far, plans are to proceed with construction. At least one large convention hotel has shut down temporarily. Orlando is a city of low wages and what is looking like a prolonged shutdown by major employers will be devastating. It grew rapidly over the past decade.Edited: 1:33 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Re: Post 72The Governor decided on the beaches (video): “They want you to social distance, of course. But they actually encourage people to get fresh air.”https:/…"
Drove down I-drive yesterday and it was a surreal scene. It was a ghost town. Virtually no one. Restaurants closed. Hotel parking lots nearly completely empty. The only place that seemed open was Coco key resort. The water park looked packed.
A water park?!!!!That is seriously dangerous and gross ick.
are there any flights from the UK being allowed in to sanford airport??
Not at the moment..
