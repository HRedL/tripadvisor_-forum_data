"China is now doing clinical trials of at least 3 anti-coronavirus drugs now, including anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, and Gilead’s experimental drug, remdesivir, and the newest anti-flue drug, Favipiravir. However, as I have worked as a Experimental and Clinical Researcher for viral diseases for more than 20 years, Favipiravir seems to be the most promising drug from the following reason.It was a new drug for influenza discovered and made in Japan, as follows.https:/…https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130005881888/However, it works as a chain terminator which inhibits the synthesis of RNA of VARIOUS VIRUSES and indeed it was found later to be effective for various viral infections including Ebola virus, etc. Recently, Favipiravir demonstrated encouraging effects in a clinical trial involving 70 patients with new coronavirus COVID-19 infection in China. Chinese Government approved Favipiravir as experimental anti-coronavirus, as follows.https:/…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGH2XfbcKsghttps:/…Japanese Prime Minister Abe also ordered Japanese Government yesterday to encourage the wide use of this drug in Japan. Therefore, we might finally obtain the resolution for outbreak of this virus soon!!"
"Efficacy of Favipiravir (commercial name of the drug in Japan is Avian) for preventing the development of serious symptoms in mild cases, and the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic cases with coronavirus was also confirmed in Japan. Here are the latest news about Favipiravir (Avian) from Japan. https:/….XlEADy3ANSwhttps:/…0006371608"
"Thanks for the news. I hope that works out so that we can reduce the risk from this virus. According to one of the articles you linked to, it is also called Avigan? (with a g)I certainly hope they pick another commercial name other than Avian. The name Avian may bring back the negative memory of Avian Flu. That will hurt its acceptance by the general public.Edited: 6:52 am, February 22, 2020 "
"Sorry, yes, it's Avigan, not Avian.https:/…0006371608"
"It is not Avian, it is Avigan, by the way."
Is there is possibility to buy somwhere such medicine ?
"It is a drug you need a prescription from a Japanese hospital. Also, although it has been a drug for influenza since 2014 in Japan, because it has a concern for teratogenesity, it has not been widely used as anti-flu drug in Japan, and only used for selected patients with severe flu which cannot be treated with other anti-flu drugs. However, this drug is effective for other viral infections including Ebola virus and the new coronavirus. Thus, Prime Minister Abe ordered its production and wide use for the coronavirus in last Saturday. Thus, I hope its prescription can soon be obtained in Japanese hospitals, but probably only to those who are diagnosed as having this virus. Tomorrow, Japanese Government are going to have an announcement for prevention, diagnosis, and probably also for treatment of this virus, and they may show us current results of the clinical trial of this dug for the virus. If they show us new information, I will show them here tomorrow."
"We read more actual information about effects of existing antiviral agents on 2019-nCoV : https:/…Coronavirus_disease_2019. There have been found 30 drugs of traditional and alternative medicine, which have a necessary antiviral effect. Among them, there are both, exotic agents that are rarely found and quite popular antiviral drugs.So lopinavir and ritonavir are on this list. Both substances are used in the treatment of HIV and are the active ingredients of Kaletra.See more: http://medhalsa.site/p/covid4en/kaletra.html"
"It's way too early and premature to state, "" Favipiravir as the most promising anti-coronavirus drug"" since the clinical trial has just begun. I understand and appreciate Doctor Mabei's enthusiasm but this post is misleading, IMO. The clinical trial of Remdesivir on COVID-19 patients has begun in the US. This medication has previously shown promise in animal models for treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which are caused by other coronaviruses. Remdesivir looks more promising to me:https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-release…"
"Yes, I also know that more than 80 clinical trials are going on for treatment of the coronavirus now, as follows.https:/…d41586-020-00444-3https:/…d41573-020-00016-0But, I think nucrleoside analogue which has strong direct anti-viral effect will be the most promising. Remdesivir is also a nucrleoside analogue, created by Gilead Science, the leading company for anti-viral medicine in the world. Thus, it’s indeed similarly promising as Favipiravir for the coronavirus, although it was not effective for Ebola virus in the clinical trial in Congo, as follows.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RemdesivirHowever, the first reason why I expect Favipiravir as the most promising drug to treat the coronavirus is that any effective for this virus drug should come out ASAP to treat the patients before its outbreak ends. Favipiravir is already appoved for influenza in Japan in 2014. Because it cannot be used for pregnant women due to its teratogenicity and embryotoxicity, the drug has not been usually used as anti-flu drug even in Japan. Toyama Chemical and Fujifilm, the producer of the drug, have stocks of 2 million tablets (for 50 thousand patients, since one patient takes 40 tablets in 5 days), but were asked from Japanese Government to increase the production of the drug to treat the coronavirus last Saturday. Secondly, favipiravir is known to act as the “Chain Terminator” to block the synthesis of RNA of various RNA viruses, similarly to the famous Harboni of Gilead Science acts for HCV. Thus, it looks effective from virological point of view.In the case of Remdesivir, clinical trials have just started in the U.S.A., but their results will come out on late April or early May."
"Anyway, whatever treatment, I wish it to be established ASAP in Japan, so that more foreign visitors can come safely to Japan, as @2 months before."
"I can’t believe a physician made such an irresponsible post without any evidence to back up his claim. Yes, favipiravir was tried on several patients in China and showed some promise, but the trial was not done in a controlled environment. These patients who got favipiravir might have gotten better without it anyway. Since there was no control group, we really can’t telll what made these patients better.How the drug works is not an evidence it will work on the coronavirus. Op should have said favipiravir could be or might be the most promising anti coronavirus drug. Even that is stretching the facts, though. In any case, this post is misleading especially if the reader is a non medical layperson."
That’s Japan.
"I showed this post to several physicians at work and they either laughed out or shook their heads. I don't think any American physician I know would post anything like this on a public forum; very limited human trial, no controlled research, no evidence, nothing to backup your claim. I really hope this drug would work on COVID-19, but it has lots of side effects as well. I can't wait to see how the trial in Japan goes."
"＠ShinzouiUsually, I only tell and prescribe to my patients the drugs approved by our Misitry of Health, Labor and Welfare, based on possible results on phase III clinical trial(s). But, I think who can only tell the results of phase III trial with no hope in this kind of emergent situation is ""the non medical layperson"". Although the phase III trial is the proof for its efficacy, sometimes we can expect its efficacy before the phase III trial. Prime Minister Abe told yesterday that clinical trials of at least 3 drugs are going on in Japan and the results of Avigan (Favipiravir) will be obtained in late March. I think he mentioned this based on the opinions of several experts in Infectious Diseases in Japan. My hope is just as same as what the Prime Minister have said. @Dr. Shibuyakko,I don't care what you and your colleagues said about me. But, I noticed the lack of sense of emergency in you and your colleagues, despite the number of infected people is increasing in the U.S.A. I think this is probably because positive results of phase III trial is required for the approval by FDA. I wonder what will happen if this disease is spread out in the U.S.A. before positive results are obtained from the phase III trial(s) of Remdesivir, may be in May? May be, nothing. Positive phase III trial is required because the drug is expensive in the U.S.A., even in emergency situation. Then, I feel sorry for American people. Even if Remdesivir is approved by FDA, it will be very expensive, and people without a good health insurance won't be able to take it: they are asked what insurance they have, and if is not covered by the insurance, no treatment, just goodbye. So, there are poor patients, but only rich doctors in the U.S.A. @kobekeith,Yes, I'm glad I am a Japanese doctor, who can care any patients, thanks to our National Health Care system."
"“Our” National health care system? What does that mean?! Your nationalist leanings are slipping out again. Be careful. People might see through it. FYI everyone, even foreigners born in Japan aren’t included in that comment made by an alleged Japanese doctor. It’s “their” system and “their” country no matter how long you’ve lived here or even if you’re born here but don’t actually have any Japanese blood in you. Sad but true. Even though “we” all pay for the same health care and pay the same taxes. Always unwelcome outsiders under the surface."
"@ kobekeith,Why I'm a Nationalist? As I said, ""Anyway, whatever treatment, I wish it to be established ASAP in Japan, so that more foreign visitors can come safely to Japan, as @2 months before."" That's true. Please think about what do you mean by ""That’s Japan."" I thought you were the Nationalist. You thought most of the medicine in Japan is based on without phase III trials, didn't you?"
"@mabeiLook, all I’m saying is that you need to show scientific data that can backup your statement.The human trial of favipiravir in any meaningful scale has not even started. Thus there is no data to support your post. End of discussion."
"The title of his post has the word ""promising"" therefore I don't see anything misleading. He didn't claim that it was THE cure for coronavirus. Also, it doesn't matter whether he's a doctor or not. He can have his own opinion on the matter and share it with others."
"Of course anybody can post his own opinion on a public forum such as this, but I think when a physician posts a scientific claim the bar should be set higher, IMO. To those of you who are interested, here is a good article by Nature about the clinical trials that are going on in China. The funny thing is that Favipiravir is not even mentioned here, though I believe they have tested it on several patients:https:/…d41586-020-00444-3I've also read that the Fujita Medical University in Japan has submitted a permit for a clinical trial to test Favipiravir on 70 patients. So the phase III trial may begin in the near future. Will be really interesting to see how this drug does in a placebo controlled, double blinded trial."
"@Jay B, and those who gave me Helpful Votes,Thank you. Exactly.I wanted people to pay more attention to the drugs on clinical trails for the coronavirus."
"Considering one of the main reasons that the outbreak of the virus is so bad is because of China’s actions, or rather lack thereof in the first place I don’t think we should have great faith in these medical trials."
"＠Shot,Thank you. Yes, DNA vaccine is another good candidate. Anyway, it is the Japanese Government that approves drug in Japan. In the case of Favipiravir (Aigan), our Prime Minister said clearly on TV that ""Observational Study"" is going on in Japan. I thought he is going to approve the drug based on phase II trial, because it's an emergency. I have read in a review article for Randomized Clinical Trials in NEJM in the past that emergent situation can be an exception to phase III clinical trials. This is also not only a medical issue, but also a social, economic, and political issue, especially before Tokyo Olympic 2020: he wants to save as many people as he can ASAP, and compensate their initial mistakes on not banning Chinese entry, and on spreading the virus in a cruise ship. We will see."
">>I have read in a review article for Randomized Clinical Trials in NEJM in the past that emergent situation can be an exception to phase III clinical trials. <<I wonder when was ""in the past."" These days, nobody will distribute a drug to the general public without a human trial in a controlled environment (phase III trial). Otherwise, we won't know if the drug is effective and/or safe. Favipiravir seemed to work on several random Chinese patients but that doesn't mean a thing. They might have gotten better with sneak oil for all we know. Not even Abe is stupid enough to allow a drug to be distributed to the general public without figuring out if it works and/or safe. Well, he just might as his political life and the Olympics are at steak."
"Here is a news article in Wall Street Journal today about Japan is going to test this drug despite danger of birth defects. I don't know if you can see the whole article though, as Wall Street Journal is usually behind a pay wall.https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-tests-cor…"
"There are 6 clinical trials already going on in China: https://www.bioworld.com/articles/433502-sih…Interesting to see if the Japanese trial shows the similar results to Chinese ones. We won't know for quite some time, though."
"Although RCT is regarded as gold, there are many reviews which point out the problems of RCTs. Not only the one I have read in the past, but here is a relatively new Review in NEJM which also describes the limitation of RCTs.https:/…NEJMra1614394Especially, in the Table of this Review, ""Impractical for urgent situations"" is listed as weakness of RCT.Anyway, if Mr. Abe approve the drug in order to save as many patients as possible ASAP, based on the data in the observational study which show patients taking the drug is associated with no death, you cannot call him ""stupid"". The safety of the drug has already been known in the clinical trials for influenza and Ebola in the past."
"Doctors, you disagree strongly, so I'm curious to see what answer each of you gives to this: do you think by April things are back to normal? My theory is if you both give the same answer, given how much you disagree, that will be the correct answer."
"Nobody knows. It's just a speculation. But, it's true that our Prime Minister wants to do something positive ASAP. Although it depends on the data of clinical trial, even the data already obtained in China is promising or clear: I only know the data in part. RTC is necessary when the difference is marginal or unclear. but it is not when the efficacy is clear, especially in urgent situation. Thus, I speculate by April, but not all doctors as you know. I'm going to ask my colleague, Professor of Infectious Diseases in our University about if the data in China was clear and why they are doing phase II trial in Japan when I meet him tomorrow."
">>>:do you think by April things are back to normal? <<I'm not an infectious disease specialist so I don't know. But the general consensus among the experts is that COVID-19 cases will peak in April-May globally. I personally think it will get worse now to end April then the cases will slowly come down. It's just my educated guess.As for the cure. There won't be any miracle drug available by Aprill. Many promising drugs are still in a trail or even pre trial phase. It takes at least a few months to determine the efficacy and safety of each drug. Historically speaking, we have not developed any drug that works well against other coronavirus disease such as SARS and MERS, so I'm not very optimistic about finding a miracle drug for COVID-19 soon. Likelihood of developing vaccine is higher, but the experts say that won't be available clinically until next year."
"Thank you for your replies. I am not concerned for myself because of my age, but it seems like every day more and more is closed and I fear by April I'll arrive in Japan for the trip if a lifetime only to find everything I want to see and experience is closed.I had some hope as the word in the investor world is that the outcome of remdesivir will be out by the end of March rather than April 10 as planned, which seems like only good news, but it seems like that's a hope against hope."
">>>I had some hope as the word in the investor world is that the outcome of remdesivir will be out by the end of March rather than April 10 as planned<<<I have no idea where you got that idea, but a proper clinical trial takes a long time. Please read and note that the estimated completion of the trial. It's April 1, 2023:https:/…NCT04280705"
"Sorry, I should have been more clear, it's the preliminary readout of data collected that is expected to come early. Proper studies take too long, but depending on the data off-label use is always an option."
This is the one I'm talking about https:/…NCT04280705
"The bottom line is that no drug will be made available to the general public without a proper clinical trial. I still don't know what data you refer to but even if that show great results, you and I won't be getting the drug anytime soon."
"Sorry, I pasted the wrong link.this onehttps:/…NCT04252664"
"In the case of SARS in 2003, effective drug could not be found because its outbreak suddenly ended in June when several clinical trials were going on and development of those drugs ended. This happens in this kind of infectious disease outbreak. in the following Editorial in NEJM which I've already showed, Dr. Frieden clearly wrote in his Summary that ""These limitations also affect the use of RCTs for urgent health issues, such as infectious disease outbreaks,----"".https:/…NEJMra1614394 and its Table 1.He also wrote in the following site that ""RCTs may not be practical for population-wide interventions and often aren’t relevant for urgent health issues such as infectious disease outbreaks, for which public health decisions must be made quickly."" https:/…I knew this idea from @20 years ago, but those are what I exactly meant.Those clinical trials you listed are all of Remdesivir which may come out in May, June or later, but I wish it comes out ASAP when it is really needed, unlike in the case of SARS. But, it won't: that's why I hope Japanese Government to approve Favipiravir (Avian) earlier, so that it can save people in Japan ASAP and we can recommend foreigners to come to Japan. We will see."
"Sorry, Avigan, not Avian."
this is not quite true. The journal articles you cite are from 2017... if you had a recent controlled human trial for Favipiravir that showed statistically significant results against COVID-19 you should list them but I suspect you have none...There are several promising clinical trials of other RNA polyemerase chain terminators like Remdesivir but you should cite one with results that are out NOW . As of now no results are out from any controlled trials until at least APRIL...  While it would be great if this worked I havent seen any significant results yet in any double blind placebo controlled human trial yet that showed statistically significant improvement in surviving COVID-19 infection in humans.China has approved several drugs but I havent seen any results yet. There are over a 100 trials of drugs and vaccines in China and in the US and all over the world including Chloroquine and Kaletra.
"I have mentioned that RCT is NOT always the Golden Standard in Clinical Medicine, just as Dr. Tom Frieden clearly wrote in NEJM. It does not matter if it was 2017 or 2018 or 2019. He was the director of CDC in the U.S.A., an Expert in Infectious Diseases is much more important. This suggests that Japanese Experts of Infectious Diseases will also think the same way in this urgent situation.BTW, China have just reported their positive results of the RCT of Favipiravir showing the efficacy of the drug for the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection yesterday, as follows.https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/202…xinhuanet.com/english/…c_138887971.htm"
"Have you seen this article though - https:/…026000c""However, an individual related to Japan's Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare pointed out, ""We've given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn't seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied. The same goes for Kaletra."""
"Actually, China will approve the drug based on the positive results of their RCT in Wuhan, but they are in the final stage of the outbreak, and should have approved the drug earlier to save the life of patients before more than 3,000 people died. Anyway, the infection is still a big problem in the world, and this might be the only good present from China to the world in this case. Japan will also approve it soon."
"Again you don’t seem to understand what a controlled trial is....and the year does matter because you need to see how it does against Covid-19 and the trials you cite were in Vitro tests not a placebo controlled double blinded trial in humans against Covid-19. Favipiavir is one of many Chain terminating drugs and like most will probably fail in a controlled trial..Dr Ximin could not provide data from a controlled trial...and he is from the chinese ministry that has the final say so. Abe is a politician not a scientist so what he says has about as much weight as Trump which is basically zeroCiting newspaper articles makes no sense...you need to cite a controlled human trial done against covid19 from a refereed journal...or what you have said is total nonsense.And again it doesn’t matter who says anything in Nejm...you need proof backed by controlled trials...anything else is pure bsEdited: 2:36 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Wow, thank you. Finally here comes someone who truly understands the issue. I've given up on discussing with op as he doesn't seem to get it no matter what."
"@ ShotI guess you're implying that I wrote #41 and 45, but I did not. As for your question, yes, it's worthy news, but it's just news and we don't even know the article is accurate. In the medical/science community, you simply cannot cite a newspaper article as evidence of medical research. A physician/scientist should know that."
"As @Shot said, it's not an IN VITRO study in China, RCT. But , we have to see the details of the results of the studies in China and Japan. But, if those reports are accurate, the drug might not be efficient in severe patients, although is effective in mild patients. But, it seems no patient is severe from the beginning. So, they might have to take it early."
Looks like Mabei was right! https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/1…
"Thank you, Grey Suitcases. Yes, I'm glad that efficacy of Favipiravir (Avigan) was proven in the clinical trials, including RCT, in China and the drug became the first drug for Covid-19 in the world, as I have expected @1 month before. The results of the trials were written in Japanese Wikipedia of Favipiravir in more detail, as follows. https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ファビピラビルHowever, I wanted this drug to be approved in Japan ASAP, so that it can help foreign travelers to come to Japan. Thus, it's only @50%, and it should be approved in Japan ASAP. Even if it won't be effective in severe patients in Japan as written in the site of Mainichi Newspaper, it's no problem if it's effective for mild and moderate patients, as clearly shown in the trials in China, since most severe patients are not severe from the beginning. It would only mean to take the drug ASAP after its diagnosis. Actually, I assume no anti-viral drug can be effective when cytokine storm has developed in severe cases."
"Who's right was never the issue here. An effective and safe medication becoming available to the general public is. I'm glad to see favipiravir showed some efficacy and safety in the Chinese study. But you need to remember that the drug was given to only 340 patients. I don't know how Japan approves medications but I'm sure they'll have to do more clinical trials in Japan. I sincerely hope that gets done very soon. For your information, both chloroquine and remdesivir showed some efficacy in random trials as well."
"Favipiravir, also known as Avigan, was developed as anti-influenza drug by Toyama Chemical in Japan, as follows, then Fuji Film bought Toyama Chemical in 2008. https:/…Japanese Government approved the drug for influenza in 2014, and Toyama Chemical initially hoped that it would become a new influenza drug that could replace Tamiflu. However, animal experiments showed the potential for teratogenic effects on fetuses, and the approval by Japanese Government was greatly delayed and its production was limited only in an emergency by new influenza virus in Japan. In March 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration completed a Phase III clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in the treatment of influenza. But, the drug also showed unique inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo to many other RNA viruses including Ebola virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, other flaviviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses, as follows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FavipiravirSo, it's efficacy was also expected for the Covid-19. A Chinese company obtained the license from Fuji Film, and started its clinical trials for Covid-19 from February, 2020, and Chinese officials announced that the drug had been effective in treating Covid-19 in Wuhan and Shenzhen on March 17, 2020."
The question now is how long it takes the Japanese government to approve favipiravir as a COVID-19 treatment and make it available to the general public. Time to buy some Fuji Film stocks :-)
"Rather than asking an outsider, why don't you ask the company itself?…fujifilm.co.jp/information/…200225.html"
"I started this post FREE only for foreign travelers coming to Japan, but I was very sad because I was heavily criticized from the U.S.A. So, I wanted to do something for myself, not for others. Thus, I bought many stocks of Fuji Film last week, of which value is @1.2 times and I’m happy now, although this wasn’t my primarily goal!! Gilead Science in the U.S.A. will announce the result of their current ongoing phase III trial in China in April. Anyway, I now hope that stocks of not only Fuji Film but also of many other companies in the world to increase by these drugs changing current PESSIMISTIC world into future OPTIMISTIC one and we can hopefully recommend foreign visitors to come to Japan again in the future!!"
<>The RCTs of chloroquine and/or remdesivir for Covet-19 have not been completed yet.
"It's way too early to even speculate which medication is most effective against COVID-19 at this time. Japan still has to conduct a clinical trial of favipiravir within Japan which will take some time. Meanwhile, in the US, clinical trials of chloroquine and remdesivir are on the way. Both showed some efficacy in random studies. In any case, we need to find a cure ASAP!"
Hi would it be possible to obtain Favipiravir for myself and my family.I am a doctor in Florida and my wife and I are close to 60 so I am willing to trust Japan's FDA and take the medication if we contract the virus
"That's a strange question coming from a doctor. If you're a real doctor (MD), you should well know that nobody can get a medication that is not approved by the FDA in the US. Read about remdesivir and chloroquine trials against COVID-19. Both of them showed some positive results. In the US at the moment, the best you can do is to get hydroxychloroquine. Also, read about hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combo against COVID-19:https:/…I'm keeping hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin at home."
"Although Favipiravir was approved in China, it's a pity that it cannot be used in other countries. Even in Japan, approval of Remdesivir might be earlier than Favipiravir. I think Fuji Film should have done an international clinical trial including China, Japan, and other countries, so that it can be approved earlier in other countries. Gilead Science has done much better with international clinical trials including China, although we don't know their results yet. Although PM Abe have recently announced that they are going to work with other countries for early drug development, he should have done it much earlier. If the drug is approved in Summer (@August), there might be no patient with the disease. International community should think about better specific ways to cope with this kind of pandemic infection outbreak."
https:/…101f44864203Looks like Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is one step ahead of everything else.
"Dr. Mabei - if you didn't get out of your Fuji stocks when it bounced the other day, might want to do it on the next bounce. Even Fuji doesn't think they'll make much money on this, and there is a lot more to the company than this one drug. The Chinese are able to make the drug for themselves without paying Fuji per the license agreement they had that ended last year, and Fuji doesn't actively market Avigan, so it's not even approved in most places."
"BTW, to keep information here correct, it should be mentioned the FDA does in fact allow for unapproved drugs in some circumstances, and the current situation fits, but there is no supply in the US of this drug, so the exception possibility is moot here."
"I was just talking to my physician (had a physical last month and was getting the results), and he mentioned Avigan. He said it worked for Ebola, and is definitely the promising drug for COVID-19. Although Fuji Film had the original patent, it can now be made by anyone, so probably China has made the generic version.Edited: 1:33 am, March 23, 2020 "
Timely article. https:/…
"I don't want to discuss about stocks in this TA Forum, but briefly, Fuji Film had allowed a Chinese company to make its generic, and the clinical trials in China were done by using the generic. I don't know if this was the reason why Fuji couldn't join in the clinical trial in China, because they say Fuji has good relationship with the Chinese company. But, Fuji still has its right in other countries, since it was approved for influenza in the U.S.A. in 2015, and for Ebola virus in other countries. Clinical trials for Favipiravir for Covet-19 are now going on in Italy and Japan. It's a pity if this drug cannot be approved for Covet-19 in the next month in Japan.But, since it's now Pandemic, clinical trials for any drug should be international, so that it can be simultaneously approved in the world. The clinical trial of Chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine was just started, and only in the U.S.A. Gilead Science might be the only company to have the power (money) for such international clinical trial, as mamajeli have just introduced. Political leaders have said that they are going to work together, but I wonder what they mean in reality, and if this is the only international trial, so far. From virological point of view, Favipiravir, which is effective even for Ebola virus, seems to be stronger than Remdesivir, which could not be approved for other viruses."
Thank you anyway. We all waiting a good results from anywhere from any places all around the world and holding our breath.And praying our scientist an dr. Will found something to rescue humanity. So please find something quickly.What are anyone think about Planequenil?? Plus azitromisin combination?? Is there any opinion about this. Please could you share it? Thanks.L
"Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate), anti-inflammatory and anti-malarial agent, was also a candidate for treating the Covid-19 infection in addition to Remdesivir, Favipiravir at first in China, and is now tested by clinical trials in many countries. However, the drug has a side effect to the heart and cannot be given to a person who has heart disease. Also, China have recently reported on March 25 the result of a small RCT that hydroxychloroquine did not show any efficacy for the Covid-19. BTW, Favipiravir was effective in a RCT and approved in China, but has not been approved in any other countries. Fuji Film has just started an international RCT of Favipiravir in Japan and other countries, and it will take more time. Gilead Sciences will report the results of the RCTs of Remdesivir in China in early April, and in the U.S.A. and other countries in May, and Remdesivir might be the first drug in the rest of the world."
"Efficacy of anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir-ritonavir, for severe pneumonia caused by Covid-19 was denied by the RCT in China, as follows. https:/…NEJMoa2001282Therefore, we now should expect the results of RCTs of Remdesivir for patients with severe Covid-19 (from early April) and mild or moderate Covid-19 (from mid April) diseases in China."
"In the US, the FDA issued emergency authorization of hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 patients:https://news.yahoo.com/fda-issues-emergency-…We've already started giving it along with Z-Pack to many patients in my hospital. So far, nobody had adverse reactions, as far as I know. Can't tell how effective they are yet."
"Here are the latest news of Favipiravir and Remdesivir.1. RCTs.1) Favipiravir:The results of RCT which compared the efficacy of Favipiravir vs Umifenovir(Arbidol) for moderate patients with Covid-19 infection was reported from China. The clinical recovery rate of day 7 was higher (P=0.02) in the Favipiravir group (71.4%) than in the Umifenovir (Arbidol) group (55.9%), as follows.https:/…2020.03.17.20037432v22) Remdesivir:: Among 6 RCTs which are going on in the world for Remdesivir, 2 trials in China will be completed within April, and will be soon reported. I expect this drug to be the first drug approved for mild and moderate Covid-19 disease in the world. 2. Compationate Uses:1) Favipiravir:It was announced 2 days ago that German Government would purchase Favipiravir (Avigan) from Fuji Film Holdings to treat Covid-19. They are probably going to use it for “Compationate Use” to their patients, and they say they are going to use it for severe patients, but I assume it will be better for mild and moderate degree patients. But, Japanese Government announced yesterday that they will distribute Favipiravir (Avigan) to other 30 countries, which have requested it, FREE, while asking those nations to participate in the international clinical trial of the drug. Then, there are many Japanese, who are unhappy with the news, probably because they don’t know that Favipiravir(Avigan) can also be used now FREE for Compationate Use at a limited number of hospitals in Japan. The Government should at least open the name of the hospitals where people can receive its Compationate Use.2) Remdesivir:Gilead Sciences had also allowed Compationate Use of Remdesivir for patients who could not enroll in clinical trials in the U.S.A. But, since the number exceeded 1,000, they continue the Compassionate Use program now only for children and pregnant women, reducing the numbers to a level where the system can cope. https://www.gilead.com/stories/articles/an-o…"
"I can tell you I know one hospital in the USA using Remdesivir for people who have a confirmed positive test, but the issue they had was until a few days ago they had a 5 day turnaround on tests, so they were moving on to other treatment methods rather than waiting for most people. Doctor still hasn't seen Avigan, not because he wouldn't try it, but because he can't get his hands on it.,. Any idea if the US is in those 30 countries?Edited: 9:10 am, April 04, 2020 "
Indonesia seems to be among the 30 countries and Germany is said to buy them. You can read how it is seen in the US in the article below.https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronaviru…
The US will be one of the first countries to get Avigan from Japan. We just have to convince the FDA:https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/31/whi…
"Germany seems to be earlier.https:/…What do you think making the difference between the numbers of death between the US and Germany? The number tested is different, so it might not be fair to compare but is it obesity rate, related with people with high blood pressure or diabetes?"
">>What do you think making the difference between the numbers of death between the US and Germany?<<I wish I knew. Could be a lot of factors, and I'd really like to know how Germany keeps the death rate so low--currently at 1.4% vs US's 2.7% as of today."
"Look at the number of hospital beds per capita in Germany vs the US, as well as how well-versed and well-equipped they are for ECMO."
"The US has fewer hospital beds per capita compared to many other countries mainly because we don't hospitalize patients unless they really need to be in the hospital. For example, after an appendectomy, we usually discharge a patient after 1-2 days compared to 6-7 days in other countries. Many surgeries are done as outpatient bases in the US as well.The US, however, has the highest ICU beds per capita:https:/…1dbfb6887f86Do you have the date that shows the availability of ECMO in Germany vs the US?"
"Lovepastries might get a different source but so far Wikipedia for ECMO:https:/…Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenationBTW, ECMO is for the very last stage ,doesn't it? I found the FOX news coverage, published on March 24.https:/…why-germany-coronavirus-deaths-low"
">>BTW, ECMO is for the very last stage ,doesn't it?<<You got it right. ECMO is reserved for very critically ill patients, the last-ditch effort, mainly because it can cause many bad complications. Putting a patient on the ECMO itself is a hardship for an already compromised body. ECMO is not used all that much at all. I've only seen several patients on ECMO in my 20+years in working in the ICU. Thanks for the link to the Fox News article. A very aggressive testing and COVID positive population being relatively young in Germany are most likely the factors in their death rate being so low. I hope you're safe and well, Global."
"Thank you so much for your kind words., Doctor. Because most of my work were cancelled, I'm staying home all the time except grocery shopping and occasional strolls on weekdays.ECMO couldn't save Ken Shimura. I prayed that it would save the nationwide loved Comedian. It seemed to be too late for the former heavy smoker, who quit smoking when he got pneumonia four years ago. The US was definitely too late to start testing, letting it spread all over the country. I remember the number was less than 700 when I met New Yorkers in February. I'm quite surprised even they didn't have enough test kits to check all the passengers on Ruby Princess, now they are testing 1.6 millions.Once the Health Ministry change the policy of saving patients with mild symptoms from being hospitalized, maybe Japan can test more. It is hard to tell how actually wildely spread it is in Tokyo now that I feel the least time on the trains and buses are safer. My prayers are with you, all the great health care workers and the people to survive this hard times."
Israel will start with 80 patients.https:/…202004070000122.html
"I'm happy to report that some hospitals in the US started to use remdesivir on COVID patients, including the hospital I work at. We also use hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Avigan is not on the scene yet because it's not approved by the FDA . I wish they can expedite the process so we can start testing!"
"Yesterday Mr. Abe announced if the patients would like to, they could ask their doctors to get them Avigan.I saw the news of the doctor who used Ciclesonide to some of the patients from Diamond Princess. He talked quite persuasive. https://www.fs-hkd-sc.com/?p=111"
"The problem of Favipiravir (Avian) and most other drugs is that clinical studies (RCTs) are now going on and Favipiravir(Avian) is going to be approved in April and other drugs even later. The results of RCTs of Remdesivir in China will be obtained in April and this drug will be the first to be approved in many countries,"
"Dr. Iwabuchi got his report in English already on the internet.https://writening.net/page?FC3QPmI think he said on the TV news program, ciclesonide was already approved in Japan, so his team gave it a try and it worked well."
"@Global715255The report you presented is a case report of 3 cases who received Ciclesonide (Alvesco) for Covid-19. There are many case reports using many other drugs for Covid-19. Ciclesonide (Alvesco) is not approved as a medicine for Covit-19. As the authors of this report clearly mentioned in the last part of this report, observational study with more cases is needed and finally randomized control trial (RCT) is required for the drug to be approved by the government.When I first posted that Favipiravir (Avigan) was the most promising drug for Covid-19, I was heavily criticized that I should not say that the drug is effective until we see a positive results in RCT. I thought that in this kind of urgent situation with a pandemic infectious disease, the Government should not follow ordinary policy with RCT. My opinion was the same as the opinion of previous Director of CDC in the U.S.A., Dr. Tomas Frieden, as follows, as I have already mentioned.https:/…NEJMra1614394Especially, the generic drug of Favipiravir (Avigan) had shown clear efficacy in RCTs in China. Usually, no generic drug is approved by a RCT for any diseases. Why should the efficacy of Avigan has to be proven by a RCT in this kind of urgent situation, when the efficacy of its generic drug was proven in China by RCTs ? However, unfortunately our government followed the ordinary policy and the RCT of Favipiravir (Avigan) is now ongoing in Japan and in other countries. Therefore, Avigan as well as any other drugs will not be approved as a drug for Covid-19 unless positive results are obtained by RCT(s). Compationate Uses of many unapproved drugs including Ciclesonide(Alvesco) are going on in a limited number of hospitals in Japan and other countries. But, in Japan, the name of those hospitals are not informed to people. I think the Government should open the name of those hospitals where the patients can receive the Compassionate Use of those drugs, so that the patients can select such hospital."
"I think you were criticized because you didn't put auxilary verbs like ""MIGHT be"" in your sentence. You cannot be assertive at this stage without evidence yet. Dr. Iwabuchi is calling for other doctors for more case accumulation So far it is already approved for asthma. It actually saved three critical patients.I'm totally sad about the in-hospital infections going on at Eiji Hospital. Taito Ward has the largest populations of the elderly among the 23 wards. Still 24 were found testing positive today, too. More than 140 something in total. I guess more than 6-8 died. The sick people are extremely vulnerable to infections.Edited: 10:20 am, April 08, 2020 "
"It's Japan, but if it happened in the US, the hospital will be sued, I believe. And Eiju General Hospital might need to pay for the compensation.It's the major hospital in this neighborhood, so I also went there when I got injured decades ago."
"Yes, I am sorry for the Eiju General Hospital. Many hospitals in Japan do not want to be like the Eiju Hospital, so they don't want to see any Covit-19 patients now. Indeed, in my hospital, a patient whom I saw 2 weeks before for fever and cough, called us that he still has high fever and frequent cough, and he wanted us to call the local ""Hokenjo"" who can test the Covid-19 virus, because when he called the Hokenjo, he was asked to contact us at first. So, I called the Hokenjo for him and told them that they should definitely test his blood for Covid-19 and he went to the Hokenjo. The director of our hospital didn't want him to come to our hospital again, because he don't want our hospital to be like the Eiju hospital."
"Anyway, I only said Favipiravir is the most promising drug: thus equal to MIGHT. But, the mind of most American people have changed drastically in these 2 months. In February, the disease was Asian disease, so most Americans think that any drug requires RCT(s). However, in March the disease became a Pandemic disease with most patients in the U.S.A. Thus, many Americans now think that even compassionate use of any drug which was effective in case reports is important, even not proven in RCTs. I think that especially the Experts in Infectious Diseases should re-think about the approval system of new drugs in this kind of urgent situation. The numbers of patients have started to decrease in Italy and Spain in addition to China and South Korea. It may also decrease in Japan in 1 month. Thus, if the drug is approved in August, it might be too late, as it was in the case for SARS in 2003, which suddenly disappear in June when several RCTs were ongoing in the world: thus no drug was approved for SARS."
"It happened at Toride, too, right?　Even in a smaller scale.If your patient test positive, he needs to go to infectious wards, so you might be free from his revisit.The doctor at Kita 医療センター talked how they do zoning to prevent hospital infections on NHK. (I forgot his name.) He also mentioned that the ambulance called saying that the patients with symptoms like pneumonia are rejected by several hospitals and Kita 医療センター accepted them.Talking about Tokyo, it looks like it is quite widely spread. The Hokenjo are doing triage because there are not enough beds for the infectious. Once they have more capacity, they should test more offensively. It is quite scary to walk outside, hearing some people coughing."
"You have tendency of optimistic speculation. I guess the Americans were too much in the presidential election before noticing it widely spread in their backyard. I went to the lobby of Hilton Tokyo in mid February. While I was waiting, there were French flight crew. All of them were still doing ""la bise"" which was quite shocking when Japanese were taking a lot of precautions with the COVID-19. Two weeks later, France had the outburst. They should be more careful earlier. Less body contact. zWhen I shook hands with a New Yorker the next week, the number at the Big Apple was still small but I used the alcohol sanitizer soon at the entrance and after he shook hands before I leave, I washed my hands soonafter we parted at 7-11. They should have been more careful at that stage.Edited: 11:30 am, April 08, 2020 "
"Not a time to make optimistic speculations yet at all.Many Japanese doctors based in New Yorkers are warning us that Tokyo looks like NY two or three weeks ago. We really need to change our future without having parties for a while, iincluding the young doctors."
"Hi Everyone,All the countries across the world is looking for Covid'19 vaccine. Across the world so many scientists are working on this forum. Where are we now on this? How many trails done so far? When will be getting this vaccine fully finctiona?https://newsonthegotoday.com/ga2oml"
"It takes much time to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19. Even if there are some candidates, it takes much time to test their efficacy in clinical trials. Medicines effective for Covid-19 will come out much earlier than a vaccine. Avigan (Favipiravir) of Fuji Film Toyama Chemical will be approved in this Month in Japan and the U.S.A., and Remdesivir of Gilead Sciences will also probably be approved in the U.S.A. and Japan in this Month: although the latter drug did not improve the survival in its RCT for severe patients with Covid-19, its clinical trial for mild and moderate Covid-19 patients will soon come out and it will probably show its efficacy. Approval of these drugs can change the world and will probably enable us for travelling abroad with a travel insurance which covers these drugs for Covid-19."
"Remdesivir was approved on May 7 in Japan.https:/…Because of the side effects, I thought the news said that it would only be used with the serious and critical patients with informed consents."
">>Approval of these drugs can change the world <<Remdesivir has been authorized for emergency use in the U.S. and approved for use in Japan for people with severe symptoms. I'm a pulmonologist and ICU specialist, so I see COVID patients every day and I've been giving remdesivir to many patients for about 2 months now. I see some good results but it is by no means a magic bullet. A recent study showed that remdesivir reduced recovery time from 15 to 11 days in seriously ill patients. The mortality rate was 8.4 % with remdesivir treatment and 11.7 % in the placebo group. Thus, the FDA stated on 1 May 2020, that it is ""reasonable to believe"" that known and potential benefits of remdesivir outweigh its known and potential risks, in some specific populations hospitalized with severe COVID‑19."" Remdesivir is not a cure-all for COVID-19 by any means. As for Avigan, I have not seen any scientific data that shows efficacy in a large study. There have been small studies that showed some efficacy in selected COVID patients, but that's about it. I have not seen Avigan used in the US yet. My suggestion to Mabei is to learn to research better and stop posting statements that are not supported by scientific evidence and data. You have posted many such statements on this thread. I'd feel embarrassed if I were you."
"Our Prime Minister Mr. Abe and Minister of Korosho (Health, Welfare and Labor) Mr. Kato have said that Japanese Government is going to approve Avigan in this month for several times, and they are based on the opinions of Japanese Experts for Infectious Diseases. We will soon see if I'm right or wrong, but my opinion is not only mine, but the opinion of many Experts here. Nobody embarrasses someone by just siting the opinion of their Prime Minister. https:/…"
"I think most of us know by now that Dr.MAbei is hyperoptimistic, so much wishful thinking, and not using auxiliary verbs in the right way and doesn't care about that much about them. Rather than that, I found Dr. Kato, surgeon working in NYC, answering the TV interview quite interesting yesterday.He himself got COVID-19 without paying attention that his patients might have it. He lost conscious for three weeks and on the way of recovery after using ECMO and he also mentioned the after effects of the disease.https:/…178966.htmlI had chances to meet and talk with American and British doctors. I hope all the medical workers stay safe and strong."
