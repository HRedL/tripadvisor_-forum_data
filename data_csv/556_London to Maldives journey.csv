"OK so we're off - first hand review to hopefully help with some of the questions people have.We're travelling Lon-Dubai-Male on Emirates, then onto Dusit Thani.Heathrow - relatively quiet, queue to get into T2 but all moves quite fast. Masks required on entry and throughout. We arrived 2hrs before departure (M25 was a bit busy so delayed us!) and it took that long to get through the airport onto the plane, pretty much no time for shops/food. 75% of outlets open, incl Leon and Nero (near B46 gate)Checkin - took quite a while, not much queue but Emirates are currently in T2 vs normally in T3, so a bit more manual and staff still working out whats what.Covid test - no problems with the NHS test, took email print out of results and test booking to show time.Health declaration- they have copies at checkin to fill out, but save time doing it in advance.On board - about quarter full, looks immaculately clean, staff all seems pleased to be here and very helpful.About to take off, more to come as we progress..."
"Oh wow, how exciting! Very, very interested to hear how the rest if the journey goes please :)And interesting that the NHS C19 test and a print out was fine for this purpose."
thanks for the update - have a good journey
"Hi secretsanta, good luck with your holiday.It's interesting that you mention an NHS C19 test. Did you pay for this? I was just wondering how you did it, as I wasn't aware that the NHS C19 tests were available for the primary purpose of international travel."
"I thought that too Lynphdhttps:/…Treat""COVID-19 testing for the purposes of international travel is not available on the NHS. Pre-travel COVID-19 tests may be available in the private sector, however, private testing processes and accuracy of results may vary. This should be discussed with the test provider before payment""Perhaps secrersanta has special ""connections"" or they thought they might have symptoms a few days before travelling!https:/…"
"Reading the NHS website further, it seems results are by text which would not fulfil Emirates criteria."
Hi Secret SantaExcellent write up - I know it will have put plenty of people’s concerns in a better context. For information (first hand) the NHS test provides a response in both text and email format. Have a great trip. Richard from PurelyMaldives
"The NHS test can be booked only if you have covid symptoms. However, you book this online so nobody can really check if you actually have any of the symptoms. Not really ethical, but it can be done. Note that neither the text or the email mentions the date when the sample was collected."
"Hi Radu A, it’s definitely not ethical for people to abuse the NHS. This isn’t the place to publicly encourage people, who wish to travel internationally on holiday, to take a free NHS test that they are not eligible for.Edited: 1:48 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"Don’t get me wrong, far away from me to encourage it."
"Hi Radu A, perhaps go back and reconsider your earlier post then.Edited: 1:49 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"I certainly didn't read that as any sort of encouragement, nor is anyone responsible for someone else's actions based on what they read on a forum."
"Update 2 - made it to Maldives, now waiting for the seaplane.Surprisingly relaxing journey so far - less people on board, less people in the airport at Dubai etc going through all the customs/scanners etc makes for a pretty good run through. Masks all the way are a bit annoying but fine. They do also like you to wear gloves (they provide) but that was more flexible.No kids meals/kits on board at the moment and seemed a bit limited on alcohol but that might just be emirates. Normal supply of blankets/pillows, but they do an extra hazmat bin run for masks and gloves to keep things separate.Dubai - everything was open (middle of the night), shops all sanitising baskets on entry and controlling numbers well. Alternative waiting seats blocked of for distancing. Remember to complete the online health form for the Maldives - you can't board at Dubai until you have the QR code. We forgot to do it in advance so did it at the gate. Didn't see any random PCR testing in the transit area, that must be in the arrivals only.Flight from Dubai to Maldives was also about a quarter full. Its more heavily stacked towards the front (same on Lon-Dub), so I would suggest choosing seats further back so you have more space around you and more choice of other rows to move to and stretch out - crew seemed happy for people to take a few nearby seats after takeoff. Emirates didn't seem to be doing any proactive spacing of people across the plane.Arrival in Male - some sort of body temp scanner when coming through. Seemed a bit ropey though- I saw my 8yr go through on the screen and it thought he was 34 degrees and my 6yr old was 33 degrees so not sure its very useful! Immigration took a while despite not many people on board - plenty of staff, just seemed slow.Usual hotel staff there to greet once you come out of the baggage area, masks still in full use and lots of sanitiser around.Hotels' own lounges at the seaplane terminal mostly not open presumably due to low numbers. In the 'VIP' lounge now with 5 others. Its not very VIP but has snacks, coffee, aircon and WiFi. I think we're all on the same plane, once some others arrive in an hour or so (wait time will be about 2.5hrs).Will post again once at the resort with an update on how busy (or not!) things are there.Re the NHS covid testing - i'm not going to get into the debate on that, but there are a variety of reasons that you can get an NHS test as it says on the NHS website. I made the point around the NHS test originally as there were quite a few questions about whether it would be accepted, so I can confirm that it is accepted (results come by email and text).Personally given all the infrastructure that the NHS has set up for the testing, and the relatively low uptake at the moment, I think the NHS should offer the testing for travel and charge something below the private prices - maybe £50 or so. Could be a nice earner for them as it becomes an increasingly common requirement for travellers."
This is really helpful and interesting. Thank you! Enjoy your holiday.
"Thanks for all the info, secretsanta. So glad your journey went well and Im sure your holiday will be fantastic. Did you have to continue to wear masks in the seaplane lounge?"
"Really good to read, thanks so much for taking the time to update us all!It doesn’t sound too awful an experience, thankfully.Looking forward to hearing what, if anything, is different about the transfer and arrival at resort."
"This is very helpful thank you for posting, do you not have to be showing symptoms to have the NHS test ? And did you request the results by email as I believe they text them through at times, enjoy your holiday and I will look forward to hearing how it goes"
"Hi Jayne H, the NHS COVID-19 PCR test is not for the purpose of international travel. The permitted use of the test is shown on:https:/…""Who can get a testYou can get a test:-for yourself, if you have coronavirus symptoms now (a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste)-for someone you live with, if they have symptoms-if you live in England and have been told to have a test before you go into hospital, for example, for surgery-if you live, work or study in an area with a coronavirus outbreak (Leicester, Luton, Pendle, or Blackburn with Darwen local councils)This service is for people in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland""The NHS fit for travel website is much clearer on this subject:""COVID-19 testing for the purposes of international travel is not available on the NHS.""https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations"
Interesting thread. Can I enquire about your travel insurance for a trip to a country currently not on the FCO safe list?
"Thank you, I thought that too so was wondering how the lady travelling managed to get one on the NHS ? And they accepted it at check in"
"Hi Jayne H, yes I am wondering the same. From post 14: ""Re the NHS covid testing - i'm not going to get into the debate on that, but there are a variety of reasons that you can get an NHS test as it says on the NHS website."""
"Looking forward to updates, so lucky to travel"
Have a great holiday. Glad you got there ok.
"I have just had a quick look and there is an option saying “no symptoms” if you click that then it still gives me the option to book a test so I don’t know ? I’ve also looked at the private testing which is £150 per person which will cost me £900 as 6 of us are travelling, I just don’t know what to do now ! Also advice is all but essential travel so insurance wouldn’t cover you anyway"
"I would just do it on NHS as the poster suggested. We all pay taxes and should be able to get at least something for free. Not getting into debate on this, but do not consider it to be unethical- both are high rate tax payers with private medical and claim literally nothing on NHS or other services."
"Personally if you can afford to go to the Maldives surely you can afford to pay for a COVID -19 test. As our government advice is about not putting unnecessary stress and pressure on our NHS and testing services so surely they should be used for people who are displaying symptoms or need the test to safely working in the chosen work place. dare say I will get shot down in flames for my opinion! My big worry is and remains if it is against all none essential travel via the UK government where does that leave people with holiday insurance if medical treatment or repatriation is needed? For me personally I wouldn’t travel to the Maldives at the moment with small children - long flights, a transit, mixing with other nationalities - limited medical facilities if needed and there COVID -19 cases on the rise. It’s one thing to put ourselves as adults in that situation and potentially at risk it’s a whole different ball game to put children in that situation."
"Hi Megg092, ""Personally if you can afford to go to the Maldives surely you can afford to pay for a COVID -19 test. As our government advice is about not putting unnecessary stress and pressure on our NHS and testing services so surely they should be used for people who are displaying symptoms or need the test to safely working in the chosen work place. dare say I will get shot down in flames for my opinion!""I think you have put it very well indeed."
"I have to agree with Megg. As much as I would love to return to the Maldives after having been all Madivesed-out for a few years I would struggle Big Time with my conscience over swinging a FOC NHS test to which I wasn't truly entitled. I am not saying that this was the case for Secretsanta btw as only they know the circumstances of their situation and it's up to them but it would not be something I would consider. I'd rather pay and feel comfortable with myself.Edited: 7:49 am, August 02, 2020 "
"@Elena: I’m afraid that this is not how the NHS works - you’re not getting anything from it now but if you’ll ever need a transplant or a prolonged ITU stay probably all you lifetime tax contributions won’t cover for it. If we all go and get tested via NHS for travel purposes then the testing system will get overwhelmed and instead of having results within 24h so you can track contacts and isolate them we’ll have to wait for days. Who is going to lose? All of us!Edited: 1:34 pm, August 02, 2020 "
Great to hear how things are form horses mouth so too speak ! Have a fabulous family holiday
"Very jealous - have a brilliant time! We are going next March and really hope BA are running their direct flights by then I phoned our travel insurance and they told me they‘d still cover us if we contracted covid in the Maldives for medical treatment over there/needing to be flown home, but they wouldn’t cover cancellation for any places not on the government list, if we cancelled prior to flying. We are with Lloyd’s bank Looking forward to hearing more of your trip :)Edited: 12:39 pm, August 02, 2020 "
good to hear your experiences - thank you so much for taking time to report the reality of travelling in these unprecedented times!! keep us up to date with how things are on resort but above all enjoy .
thanks secretsanta! did you see anyone at MLE be subject to random covid testing? i read in the guidelines that they are planing to occasionally test tourists.
Looking forward to hearing (hopefully) that life as we know it still exists in paradise. Fingers crossed for you that everything feels as normal even though it's not. Thanks for taking time out to give informative feedback.
"Thank you, have a fabulous time"
"Update 3Seaplane was great fun, hot and smelly but amazing views. Probably the least covid friendly - they tried with sanitiser etc but ultimately its a small cabin and was full so everyone is quite close together, masks generally worn and only a short journey. Wait was just over 3hrs though, felt like they were filling up the planes before leaving, not sure if that is normal or not.Hotel - so we're currently on 10-1 staff to guest ratio! There are 9 guests of which we are 4. Now whilst that does hit the vibe a bit, the staff are all going out of their way to make everything as normal as possible. Little things like setting out all the loungers and towels by the pool make a big difference to the feel and ultimately its an almost private island with lots of staff! They've condensed the restaurants down to just 1 and 1 bar but changed the menus so that you can try food from all of the restaurant menus and are very flexible and making anything we like really.Covid wise they have made some real effort - there's a multiple pdf of what they are doing, but high level the staff are all wearing masks (doesnt even feel odd anymore), everyone has daily temperature checks (guests and staff), any contact points like bills etc come with a bottle of sanitiser. The staff all live on the island at the moment to reduce infection chances, even those who's homes are on neighbouring islands. All in all we're feeling 100% confident about what they are doing - combined with the low numbers of people coming in and out and the fact a lot of people travel via UAE with the covid testing, its enough to feel completely relaxed.Many of the staff have been on the island through lockdown and have been giving it all a full deep clean as well as general maintenance.It feels multiple times safer than a trip to a UK supermarket right now.Couple of questions people have asked:Insurance- we're on a bank annual policy (first direct) similar to the terms mentioned of the lloyds policy. It was in effect before covid so covers everything except for a mid-stay cancellation at our request (ie if we got here and werent happy we couldn't just come home), but covers for any covid issues and everything else as normal.Medical facilities here - the Maldives health authority have set up a number (5?) Of Intensive care facilities in the atols, so we have a 20 bed brand new ICU a couple of islands away, never been used. There's also a doctor and small clinic on site here at the hotel. One comment on the NHS debate - its already standard to get vaccinations for foreign travel free on the NHS, so i dont see why covid testing would not at some point also become standard, albeit not at present.Hopefully thats been helpful, happy to answer any (non-NHS!) questions.I'll let you know how the PCR test gets done for the return journey (2 of the 9 guests are from Dubai and returning in a few days so it will be worked out by then)"
"""One comment on the NHS debate - its already standard to get vaccinations for foreign travel free on the NHS, so i dont see why covid testing would not at some point also become standard, albeit not at present.""NOT AT PRESENT being key here.The NHS only provides polio, typhoid, diphtheria and hepatitis A vaccinations free for travellers. There is a long list of vaccinations which are not free on the NHS."
"Regarding travel insurance, it is important for people to check that their insurance covers them not only for COVID-19 related medical issues but also that their insurance is not invalidated by travelling on holiday to a destination where the FCO is advising against all but essential travel."
"So glad that you are there and enjoying a lovely holiday secretsanta. Thanks so much for taking the time to post, it will be super helpful for many people I'm sure. Have a wonderful time"
"I'd hope that it goes without saying that individuals should check that their travel insurance covers everything they need. For many annual policies, the only thing not covered when the FCO ADVISES against travel is the early termination, everything else is covered. But that will vary by policy and indeed everyone should check for themselves.Yes - not at present is key, hence including it!Thanks for all the holiday well wishes!"
Thank you so much for the updates. It’s so refreshing to hear from someone travelling at the moment. Enjoy your holiday.

"So some idiots flouting the rules makes it OK for others to do the same. Is that what you are saying or have I misunderstood?I don't get why you can't get things like (to name just a few) free screening for all sorts of nasties, free care at the point of need and the free travel jabs from which hubbo and I have benefitted over the years along with many others?Sorry but I don""t understand."
Thanks for taking the time with updates have a great holiday
If a test is required for your trip to Maldives please go and get a private test. I’m amazed by how people don’t want to understand that the NHS testing capacity it’s limited to those who have symptoms. If we use all that capacity with holiday testing this will increase the waiting time for those that need to isolate. Vaccinations can be booked in advance and are a different story.
I had a trip planned for Sep 2020 but flights have been cancelled. I am honestly so envious! Do enjoy yourselves and post updates if possible so that the rest of us know what to expect. ENjoy and keep safe!The maldives is the best place for isolation.
"Couldn’t agree more Radu A the NHS tests are for people with symptoms not people wanting a forgien holiday. My big concern at the moment is that case seem to be on a steep raising curve at the moment in Male which will be putting stress on the Maldives medical facilities, if tourists are also poorly will they be able to cope? Other issue is it’s against government advice to travel so not sure people will be covered by insurance. We would love abit if sea, sun and relaxation at the moment but at what cost?"
Every standard travel insurance policy I've looked at says you are not covered if you travel against FCO advice. Companies sell specific policies for those that need to travel against FCO advice such as journalists and aid worker
"So happy to hear a live report to the maldives! Hope you have a fantastic trip.My question for you is, when you arrived in Male you said that you had thermal temp taking. Did you see or notice if any random pcr testing was occuring?"
I dont understand how people are getting their Covid test done by the NHS. Surely you have to give a reason for you and whoever else you are travelling with who also need a test. The site clearly states it isn't intended for travel purposes.
It is puzzling certainly and nobody seems to want to talk about it any more! Perhaps someone who had a legit free one will enlighten the forum at some stage but as you say the NHS test is not supposed to be for travel purposes so I wouldn't hold your breath. Going to the Maldives is expensive anyway so paying for a test so as to play by the rules seems perfectly reasonable to me. It won't cost that much compared to the holiday itself.
@wid: I had 3 tests done myself as I’m working in a high risk job and I had symptoms. You simply book them online and there is nothing stopping you to say that for example you lost your smell/taste or you have a cough. Then you go to the drive through center where you are handed the test and you do it yourself. People working over there are not medically trained and nobody asks you anything. N.B: by the above example I’m not encouraging people to go and get unless they have symptoms.
"I don’t want to dampen anyone’s holiday but it’s worth pointing out also that should one die in the Maldives from Covid-19, you will be buried in Hululmale, no cremation or embalming and absolutely no repatriation. ...AG"
No wish to get involved in who's right or wrong but this post appeared on one of our local FB pages yesterday.....https:/…John
"HiMy experience is similar to SecretSanta so no need for a new thread. Arrived Wednesday morning at MLE after travelling thru LHR and DXB. Thermal testing as you walk thru and COVID medical screening completed to receive QR code within 24 hours prior to Male arrival. We are across the water from SecretSanta on Amilla Fushi. The island have made huge efforts to protect themselves from any sort of COVID effects which protect staff and guests alike. Testing now on island arrival and at day 3 - however this will change once country testing is increased and a central facility will provide lower cost (to the island) testing. Last night sitting on our patio with a breeze blowing and dinner served to us with no cooking, no clearing plates and no washing up was a great change for Jess and I. Vive les vacancesRichard from PurelyMaldives"
"Radu #55There would indeed be nothing to stop you from saying you had symptoms or a loss of smell/taste as long as that were the case.#57I don't do Facebook so what am I missing?!!!Edited: 3:27 am, August 06, 2020 "
"You don't have to ""DO"" FB.....just clicking the link shows the post.FWIW....I don't do it much either. Too many arguments.John"
Hi John I have clicked the link too and it just presents me with a FB sign in page. ThanksRichard from PurelyMaldives
"You need to be signed in to FB to see FB posts (you didn’t used to, going back maybe 15 years), and if they are posts in a group where you need to be a member to see the posts, you need to be signed in and a member of that group."
I am a FB member but can’t get the shared post.
"OK.....apologies, as I said, I'm no FB expert.This is what it says..... The Covid-19 testing centre in Castleton Way will test anyone who wants a test, you don't need to have symptoms and you don't need an appointment. They are there on Wednesday's and Sunday's 10 - 4pm. Results are emailed and texted within 24hrs. It is free.John"
"Oh goodness. That's the sort of post that really does put things straight. Well I never. So even though the official line is that free NHS tests are not there to fulfill travel requirements, they are in fact available for that very purpose at this clinic. I was quite disturbed by the thought of people cheating the NHS just so they could swan off on an expensive holiday."
"Hi John, that sounds like it is a test centre for ""essential workers"". Are you sure the quote isn't taken out of context with respect to this forum thread?"
"Hi Wid, best not to believe everything you read on FB.The NHS stance hasn't changedhttps:/…coronavirus-disease-covid-19Edited: 6:00 am, August 06, 2020 "
"I don't know where Castleton Way is but if it is in an area subject to a recent covid outbreak then anyone in that area would be entitled to a test. But that begs the question should you really be travelling in those circumstances.You don't need to have symptoms to be eligible for a test but you do have to have another valid reason. ie been asked to if going into hospital or by track and trace; or live in an area with a recent outbreak (Leicester, Luton.Pendle, Blackburn and Darwen as listed on NHS website)The test centres are usually run by third parties who do not check eligibility but the fact remains that NHS testing is not available for international travel."
"#67So I have heard! That's why I have never partaken of FB and never will! It scares me rigid!Looks like I was naive to think that we all had this wrong and that tests for people who had no symptoms but were about to travel were available after all. I think it's much more likely that the FB post refers to either asymptomatic people who have a legit work-related reason for requiring a test or those who live in a locally locked-down area. There is a Castleton Way in Wigan which might explain it.For the record, I have no plans whatsoever to go anywhere on holiday until a proven vaccine has been unrolled so the issue doesn't actually affect me personally except that I feel passionately protective of the NHS and all it stands for especially in the current crisis.Edited: 7:03 am, August 06, 2020 "
"""I feel passionately protective of the NHS and all it stands for especially in the current crisis.""Well said Wid."
Seeking clarification.John
We are hoping to go in November . We both had Covid in March confirmed by a privately bought anti-body test . If we then need to re test again before travelling I would not hesitate to use the empty NHS testing site at Chessington .
Poor you having contracted the virus. I bet you are glad you recovered fully. I ask this respectfully and am not getting at you but why do you think you are now entitled to a free C19 test rather than paying for one? Is it because your testing site is 'empty'?

Another thing that you might want to keep in mind is that the NHS results don’t mention the date or the time when your sample was collected. Therefore you can’t prove that this was done 96h before the flight.
"Yes a bit the centre near us is empty most of the time - Boris has set all these sites and especially in Surrey , the infection rate is really low . I would pay a small fee to cover it but most of the cost are the staff standing around waiting for someone to come in ?!"
Then I guess that is the answer - we would have to go private if a dated test is needed!I am hoping BA direct we wont need it - but if we do then private it is !
"As things stand you don't need it for BA as this is a UAE requirement, not a UK or Maldives one. We just need FCO to add Maldives to the exempt from All Non-essential Travel however with the recent spike in cases in Male, I suspect that isn't going to be soon"
"Sorry but if we have paid to go on holiday to the Maldives, have decided we still want to travel despite our Government advising us not, chances Are have no holiday insurance so should we contract the virus whilst on said holiday and have to pay for accommodation, treatment and return flights WHY would people not be willing to pay for a private COVID -19 test? We have a holiday booked for October has been booked since December of last year and insurance in place since the same date - flying with Quatar so not the regulations Emerites currently have in place - will we travel? We will make that decision nearer the time, but if it is against governments recommendation no we won’t. If we need COVID -19 test would I lie and claim to have symptoms or need it for work or hospital NO I won’t! It’s wrong on every level! why do people think it’s ok to pressure on the NHS, GPS and testing Centre’s just so they can have a few weeks in the sun?"
I'm with you 100%
"Hi DubaiAlfiedog""I would pay a small fee to cover it but most of the cost are the staff standing around waiting for someone to come in ?!""I'm not sure how much you think that ""small fee"" should be. To set up the additional local testing centres required for sample acquisition, the government had to call in the MoD to help and also recruit additional staff. The cost to the NHS has been in acquiring the required laboratory equipment, the batches of good quality reagents and trained laboratory staff that are required to carry out the COVID-19 PCR test correctly. The scale of testing required has been phenomenal, especially when considering they didn't even have this test on their books back in January. This is why even the NHS is having to get support from companies such as Randox to be able to deliver the amount of testing that is required to cover hospital patients, front line staff, people with symptoms, essential workers and people in areas of local lockdown. That's why private companies such as Randox are charging around £115 for a private test (and the cost that you will have to pay for the test to get back out of the Maldives looks to be much more than that according to some Resorts).Edited: 7:41 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Those tests are not processed locally. So if you see an empty testing site it doesn’t mean that the lab processing the test is not busy. For pillar 1 and 2 there were 175k tests done in the last 24h. These are people requiring a test because of their symptoms. If someone can access a test in a certain area without having any symptoms it’s because there is a local outbreak. You’ve probably spent thousands for a Maldives holiday, some private testing won’t get you bankrupt. So don’t abuse the system because you are “entitled” to do so."
I presume all these righteous people haven't taken any money from Rishi in the last 6 months ??
"Living off our state pensions and nothing else since March actually. No Maldives trips for us until it's safe to go back to drawing down!Edited: 6:33 am, August 07, 2020 "
"I’ve worked all the way thro the pandemic! In social care - longer hours than normal - with no let up or break insight. We have a holiday booked for October but most definitely will not be choosing a nhs guest and lying to get it! Nor will we travel against Government advice - despite the fact that I am desperate for a break, a bit of pampering and a few weeks in paradise. For us it’s not worth putting ourselves and others at risk."
You and I think very alike. By the way. I think you mean 'test' not 'guest'!You must be done in. Social care is such a difficult job. Hats off to you and I sincerely hope you get your well deserved holiday.
It's a shame that this arguing about covid testing has derailed what could have been a useful thread for those about to travel. Perhaps we can draw a line under this now and get back to directly travel related topics.
"Nope, not taken any money from Rishi. I feel lucky that my NHS treatment has continued throughout the lockdown. Some cancer patients have faced delays to surgery and suspension of chemotherapy in part because the NHS had to redeploy staff to focus their attention and resources on COVID-19. I am just baffled by anyone who feels that they should put any unnecessary pressure on the NHS, especially during the current crisis."
"Post #87 LindylouisaI agree that the post is a very good and useful idea but you must realise that unfortunately it was the OP her/himself who in commenting how they had had an NHS test led others to wonder how this had been achieved and whether or not it was perhaps, unknown to the rest of us, allowed after all. I think that it was the OP's unwillingness to explain the situation that caused a few raised eyebrows, got people thinking and gave rise to a secondary diversion within the topic."
Wid and Lynphd I couldn’t agree more!
"I hope those of you who are there are having a great time. Understanding Your experiences is really helpful, thank you, and a perfect use of this travel forum. I hope you will feel welcome to continue to share. Please!"
"OP, we have missed you! Please do continue to share. You are still very welcomed in this forum!"
Well said
"Not much to update on, especially not the NHS test debate.....had a few stormy days but now back to clear blue skies! Sounds like classic August weather over hereCOVID test due today, being done in resort then samples flown to Male tomorrow morning and results due in 48hrs. Hotel is sorting everything incl staying on top of forms we need to complete etc so doing a great job at keeping us relaxed.Guest numbers are increasing - maybe 25/30 here now. New arrivals most days, and some departures. Mix of nationalities including UK, US, Czech, Russian, French. Only some of the restaurants that are closed, other facilities are all fully functioning incl spa, kids club, ocean centre etc"
"Thanks secretsanta, so all smooth with no drama? Sounds as if it is all being handled efficiently."
Secretsanta I am not planning to travel to Maldvies until middle of next year but you are a star and your journey update is very helpful. Thanks for sharing
"Secretsanta, so glad to hear that you're having a lovely time and that everything is going smoothly for you. Thanks for taking time out of your holiday to let us all know how it's going"
"HiWe are less than 1 mile from SecretSanta - surprisingly we experienced exactly the same weather !Now blue skies, bright sunshine and shades on.Our island (Amilla Fushi) has decided to only open 1 restaurant per night as it is also offering full meal service in rooms at no additional charge. The spa is open but Kids Club closed.On 3 days we have been in the main pool for about 1 hour each time and had it to ourselves.I believe there are about 26 guests on the island.Richard from PurelyMaldives"
"Glad you're also having a lovely holiday, Richard. Hope the rest of your time on the island and your return journey goes smoothly."
Thank you for the updates only problem is you're making me really excited to go but who knows what will be happening in April! Hope you have a great holiday
Hi !Can you tell us about allowed/available activities ?I've read that tourists are not allowed to move or go for day trip to any other resort island or inhabited island but are snorkeling tours and divings tours not landing on any island available ?Is it allowed to go snorkeling from the beach ?Enjoy your stay :)Matt
"Matthieu - the watersports at Dusit Thani is fully operational. Snorkeling, diving, motorised things - I dont know that they have any trips to other islands, I would think those are not happening, but all of the core watersports is operatingEdited: 4:12 am, August 13, 2020 "
"and you can snorkle from the beach or straight from the overwater villas, they are right on the reef so you are straight into the fish action!"
"Hisame across here. The only restrictions are for trips which would normally land on a different island/land mass where people mixing could happen. Basically each island forms it’s own protected bubble. For instance, all people (staff and guests) in Amilla Fushi have passed 2 tests as negative and do not need to wear masks to move around the island. Despite this, you will find most staff still wearing a mask when serving food or coming close to guests. It all feels safe and welcoming at the same time. Richard from PurelyMaldives currently reporting from Amilla Fushi"
"Thanks to the OP and others who have been very helpful. We are on our way over to the Maldives now (currently transiting in Doha), will write a detailed overview of our experience when I get to the Maldives but so far the journey had been excellent - flight from London was about 75pct full in business (they did have Q suite on the flight from London despite their website suggesting otherwise). Doha airport is very quiet (more so than I have ever seen before). Overall we have been impressed with how seriously Qatar seem to be taking COVID - the requirement to wear face masks is followed by everyone (visors are provided for boarding and are required in economy). Our leg to the Maldives is in economy so will be able to contrast once we get there but so far I feel a lot safer here than i do shopping in my local supermarket."
"Thanks for the update on this, my wife and I are doing the same trip the end of the month! Have a safe second flight and a great stay!"
We are due to fly out to the Maldives mid November. I also have insurance through my bank with AXA. I called them to see if I’m covered if we travel and was told if we travel against FCO advise then the insurance is void. How are people getting around this?
HiIt is possible to purchase insurance that is not void when travelling against FCO advice. Richard from PurelyMaldives
@dianesw we're in the some position going with BA. I suspect that BA won't fly against FCO advice - most of their passengers won't have travel insurance (unless they have bought a special one which is unlikely) and they won't want to fly empty planes.
"I have travel insurance through my bank with Aviva and I am still covered for travel against FCO advice except for abandonment. I still would not travel though against FCO advice as it would be just my luck to get stranded - just my opinion by the way and I wish luck to anyone who decides to travel.There are companies offering insurance against FCO advice such as Battleface, but then again whilst this covers medical is doesn't seem to cover travel disruption or a lockdown. I don't know of any that will provide full cover.@lilybeachlovers BA still seem to be flying to Dubai which has an FCO advisory against all but essential travel but I would imagine they would still likely cancel if not enough passengers."
"Just to round off Doha to Male on Qatar was good. The flight was pretty empty and they had obviously blocked a lot of seats out as social distancing was well practiced. What that meant in practice was that there was nobody in the two rows in front of us or the row behind us and only 1 person in the corresponding middle rows of the plane. Masks were worn by all, visors worn by most (but not enforced eg. If people were sleeping). Immigration at Male was also fine and only took about 10 mins - they are limiting the number of people on the buses to the terminal to 29 so worth bearing in mind that disembarking might take a bit longer than one would imagine. We had our temperature checked at the airport and then again in the seaplane lounge. Overall very happy with Qatar and wouldn’t hesitate flying again with them in this environment"
"Thanks for the info, Stroudy, hope you have a wonderful holiday.Which island are you going to, by the way?Edited: 1:41 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"@LindyLouisa, in another thread I think that stroudy said she was going to Joali."
"Thanks Dianna, wow very nice."
Hi Richard. The only insurance company I’ve found is battleface that will cover you if you travel against fco advice but they won’t cover you if the island goes into lockdown
"We are indeed at Joali.On the question around insurance, we had a scare as our daughter got a fever literally within a few hours of us landing at the resort and we ended up going to hospital and having a COVID-19 test done (negative - she is fine but instead has tonsillitis). We took out insurance with Battleface and so will be making a claim - once I get back to the U.K. I will have a first hand account of how well is covers me or otherwise so will post an update. Also just to put peoples minds at ease around the state of the hospitals here - we went to the hospital in Raa Atoll - it was perfectly good; we were seen right away and they were very thorough. Joali have been great in helping us - given the above we have spent most of our time in the room so haven’t really got a feel for the island yet but will post a review once back"
Thank you for the great info - A US bloke so I will stay out of the NHS testing issue but given that Emirates/UAE are requiring a Covid test 96 hrs prior to transit - it apears that you are able to get that test done at the resort . We are staying at a Veligandu a CCR property - so understand that each resort may be different but is return Covid testing just part of the resort service to get folks to come?
For our resort if you need it the hotel will take a swab in the room and then take it by speedboat to a local clinic. I think the cost was $112 per test plus a flat $200 for the speedboat (irrespective of how many people there are) but I guess that will vary from resort to resort. The results come back within 24 hours.
"Thanks for the happy holiday wishes throughout the thread - we're home and had a fantastic trip!Final updateEverything went very smoothly, similar to way out but planes were much fuller - at least 75% full Male-Dubai and Dub-Lon.COvid test in resort - cost about $150 each, test was done in resort by their doctor, on the next days seaplane to Male and results back by email 48hrs later. There was confusion about the need for kids to have tests as the Emirates site was less clear for returning to the UK but they have now updated it - under 12s do NOT need a test. We did have to show test results a few times on the journey so keep them handy.Shops were open at Male and Dubai airports. Male was a pretty quick run through, 30 mins max from arrival there to being at the gate (incl some wrangling at checkin about seat selection!).Heathrow T2 is massive and was a long walk from plane to immigration - queue was about 20 mins, just make sure you have you passenger locator form completed before starting travel. Luggage though took 1hr20 from when we got off the plane to coming out on the belt, no idea what they were doing with it...Thats all, safe and happy travels everyone!"
