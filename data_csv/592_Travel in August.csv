"Hi, we are due to visit Kotor in August, does anyone live there or know the area, what is the situation like at the moment and is there talk of tourism coming back to life this year? Many thanks and stay safe"
"Except Croatia is in the EU, and Montenegro outside the EU borders.Anyway your guess is as good as any. I'm not optimistic."
"Hey there, I live in Tivat and Montengro certainly hopes that in August if not before it will continue business as usual. Today we hope to hear about the relaxation of the measures introduced to halt corona virus since so far, touch the wood we are doing quite alright. Total Montenegro News website gives you the most recent news from Montenegro in English. Stay safe and I hope you will come to My beautiful Country in August"
"Hi,I think you will be able to come to Montenegro in August. Of course with attention, but I'm almost sure you'll be able to visit our country. As they have already told you, partial normalization measures are already being announced.Kotor is a great choice, unique city. And the whole bay is special. Enjoy."
"We have a holiday booked to Kotor for July unfortunately I don't think we will be allowed to come by then, do you?"
Exactly probably no flights and we might still be in partial lockdown the way it's going here. A shame we were really looking forward to coming.
"Hi Philippa, you are very welcome. I am from Kotor and happy that Kotor is corona free city. At the moment Montenegro is still in lockdown, fortunately the Government has begin to discount the measures. In the beginning of May hairdressing salons, boutiques etc start operating. Cafes, restaurants and sopping centers will open on Maj 18, intercity traffic will open on June 1, airports open in July. Hope to see you in Kotor in August!Stay safe"
"Hi do you know when in July your airports open please, we are due to travel on 4th? Thanks"
"Hi, at the moment we have only information that airports will be open in July, but not exact date. I will notify you of the date as soon as the government announces the exact date.Feel free to contact me for any additional information.Greetings from sunny KotorSladjanaStay Safe"
Many thanks I'll come back to read this post later when you have an update.
"Hi, some countries are staying UK visitors are not welcome in July but have to wait until later in the year, do you know what Montenegro thinks of this? Maybe if a traveller just produced a test result before travelling has been suggested."
"Hi, at the moment we don’t have that information. Once the Government decides the date of opening the borders, we will have all informations.Feel free to contact me any time for any additional information here or on my mail montenegrocarhire@gmail.comRegards from Kotor,SladjanaStay safe"
"Hi! Montenegro airlines might start to operate in July, but it is hard to be certain at the moment. Kotor is one of the Montenegrin towns that had 0 reported cases of COVID 19. The whole country is looking to a verry positive outcome with just 1 reported case in this week. It is still early to say, but maybe from 18th of may we will have a much clearer situation. Kotor is unique in many ways, and without cruise tourism (which is almost definite for this summer) this might be the best year to visit it."
"We are due to visit Kotor in July if we can but our flight has been cancelled so I'll have at look at Montenegro airlines, thanks for tip and yes agree it sounds nicer actually without the cruise tourists."
"That's great news for you, now I just need to get there! Wish the airports and airlines would at least tell us what is being planned regarding testing or Covid 19 passports and how we get them."
paulaf who was your original flight booked with if you don’t mind me asking? We have flights booked with easyJet for July but haven’t heard anything as of yet (to be expected until nearer the time I know) I was curious as to who has already cancelled yours.
"Sam M mine is with Ryanair from Dublin on 9th of August, it’s a waiting game to be honest but I am holding out hope! We are meant to go to Mexico in July and there has been no cancellations yet for that with British airways but I expect there will be as the virus is in early stages there."
"Sam M it was BA Heathrow to Podgorica and they've cancelled the route for the whole summer, but it was a new route wasn't due to start until 4th July guess they decided this summer wasn't now the best time to run a new route. We can fly Easy jet instead if flights resume.Edited: 3:49 pm, May 04, 2020 "
BA are only working on June cancellations for now and they work about 3 weeks ahead so you won't know about your Mexico flight just yet.
"Thanks both, makes sense not the best time to start a new route!"
"We have flights on Montenegro Airlines in July, so are hoping that they will be flying to London by then."
"gov.me/en/…The UK is on the green list so you can come. Ryanair started flying from London to Podgorica today. Enjoy your vacation and take care,"
Hi we're hoping to fly into dubrovnik airport end of Aug pick up a car and spend the first three nights in Kotor montenegro. We're then dropping car back at airport and staying in cavtat for eleven nights. Trying to keep track with what's allowed and what's not. Do you think we'll be able to do this? thanks in advance
"Think if we do get it'll be easier just to come and stay the 14 days in Croatia, rather than going to both montenegro and Croatia. Thanks for your information, changing all the time"
