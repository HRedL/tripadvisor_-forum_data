"Hello,in July I plan on visiting Turkey for max. 90 days, to visit my significant other.My major concern is not having an international health insurance which would cover the costs of treatment in case I'm diagnosed with COVID-19. I've contacted the Turkish embassy in Slovenia and they replied that any foreigner diagnosed with the disease will be directed to a private hospital and they recommend I have at least 10.000 EUR with me to cover the costs if I am not insured.And since no insurance company in my country (Slovenia) offers an international insurance that covers COVID-19 treatment (since it it still considered a pandemic), I am kindly asking for your opinion on this matter. Can you recommend some (any) insurance companies that offer an international insurance I'm looking for?Thank you!Dejan"
Turkey government are now offering travel insurance to cover medical including COVID 19. Announced yesterday and apparently will be able to purchase at airports and from airlines
"Turkey unveils COVID-19 medical insurance plan for touristsTurkey will cover the cost of medical treatment for holidaymakers, the country’s tourism minister has announced.Turkish minister of tourism and culture Mehmet Nuri Ersoy has revealed plans to reopen to tourists under a Safe Tourism Certification Program to keep visitors safe from COVID-19.The plan covers all aspects of the journey from the aircraft to the airport, transfers and hotels.One of the measures announced are insurance packages that will cover medical costs up to €7,000 that will be sold by airlines, tour operators and online from July 1.The new protocols and health and safety regime were set out to the media and representatives of source markets this weekend in Antalya.Ersoy said the actions being put in place in Turkey were “trailblazing” and claimed its safe tourism certification programme was one of the first in the world to be rolled out.He said: “We would like take this opportunity to remind our guests that we will be looking forward to welcome their citizens to Turkey after the resumption of international flights.“Observing the positive impression made by the measures we have taken on our guests further confirms the expediency of our Safe Tourism Certification programme.“We considered all the details for our guests who want to have a holiday in our country.”Ersoy said the number of Covid-19 cases is now “quite low” in popular tourist cities such as Aydın, Antalya and Muğla.He added: “Thanks to our thousands of healthcare professionals working here, these cities are also health centres as well as tourism.“We thought of all the details for our guests who want to have a holiday in our country during the epidemic period. As of July 1, we have created a health insurance package that includes Covid-19 for our foreign guests visiting our country.All health expenses up to €3,000, €5,0000 and €7,000 thousand can be covered within the scope of 15, 19, and 23 Euro insurance packages that can be purchased through contracted airlines, various sales points before passport control, tour operators, and online channels.“Our guests can feel comfortable, just like the Safe Tourism Certificate, we are thinking for all of the details on behalf of them"
"So....the top level of health insurance covers up to 7000euro but the recommendation is to carry at least 10,000euro.Am I missing something??"
"One is insurance solely for to cover instances of covid-19, the other is for everything else."

"This is actually a repeat of what vip posted a short while back: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…Numerous articles online, but I can't seem to find one in English. https://www.milliyet.com.tr/ekonomi/turistle…PS: This is supposed to be in place from July, so there's no-one I could find who's offering this now.Edited: 12:15 pm, June 22, 2020 "
"Thank you so much for the valuable info everyone!I have contacted Turkish Airlines in the mean time about this new insurance and they referred me here: https:/…Can anyone confirm that this is in fact this new insurance that will be available from July 1st? I've checked this website a few days ago and I'm not sure this what we were talking about...Thank you!Edited: 4:04 am, June 24, 2020 "
"@Dejan: That's travel insurance, not covid."
"Also just worth mentioning is that this is Covid insurance to cover, as far as we know, any Covid related illness whilst in Turkey. Depending on your own country’s official travel advisory if you travel whilst the government is advising against all overseas travel except essential you would invalidate any other travel insurance you have that insured against lost baggage, accidents, lost or stolen money, passports, repatriation if required, hospital costs for treatment etc etc! I know some countries have lifted restrictions and changed advice so so please check the current advice re travel from your country."
"Does anyone have a link for this new insurance? I checked the Turkish airlines website, they don’t seem to have it"
Here it is the insurance covering covid19 - for Turkey only: https://tga.gov.tr/insurance/Note this means the international travelers need to buy 2 insurances: one to cover covid19 and the other one to cover other travel and health insurance.
"Also note it is not available to over 65’s. So the many over 65’s that visit Turkey from U.K need to ensure they are fully covered before they travel to include consequences of contracting Covid virus and the medical protection etc you would be covered for. Think flight changes, additional hotel accommodation if not well enough to travel, things affected if delayed going home to U.K."
"Hey! I am in a similar situation right now so I am wondering, what have you decided?"
