"We have a trip to Stoupa booked for September which we rescheduled from June. Bearing in mind the rules currently in place, I'd be interested to hear what other folk are thinking of doing. The big problem area seems to be that if anyone on your flight tests positive for Covid19, everyone on the flight will be required to self isolate for 2 weeks in (possibly?) government provided accommodation. Self isolation in any accommodation for 14 days seems to make the whole idea of paying for a 2 week holiday pointless? We would be gutted not to have our annual Stoupa fix, but are torn between taking the risk or not."
"U.K. visitors please be aware of the following information, which may change, but worth persevering reading so you are aware of the regulation of entry and procedure into Greece.UK FCO advice which MUST BE FOLLOWED which still suggests any UK visitor to Greece might have to undergo a Covid 19 test on arrival and to self-quarantine on arrival if you or a fellow passenger test positive for Covid 19-You must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before your arrival in Greece. The form is online, in English. Once you have completed the form, you will receive a QR code (which you can display either on your mobile phone, or on a printed piece of paper). You will need to show this code to the Greek authorities on your arrival in Greece. The PLF as it stands at the moment is mandatory until 31st August 2020 and will be reviewed.When you arrive in Greece, the Greek authorities will scan the QR code generated when you completed the PLF form, and may direct you for health screening (including testing for coronavirus). The Greek authorities’ instructions will differ according to whether you arrive by land, sea or air. Check out the requirements that will apply to you on the PLF form page.You must wear a face mask at all times when on an aeroplane or ferry travelling to or from Greece; and whilst at airports.Greece’s borders with most neighbouring countries ([Turkey](https:/…Tourism-g293969-Turkey-Vacations.html), [Albania](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g294445-…) and North [Macedonia](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g65…)) are closed to passenger traffic. The border with [Bulgaria](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g294451-…) is open.Testing and quarantineThe Greek authorities may require you to undergo testing for coronavirus, as part of health screening after you arrive in Greece. Any passenger entering Greece is liable to be asked to undergo a test, but you are likely to be asked if you have arrived from a country outside of the EU (including the UK), either directly or via indirect [flights](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g189398-…).If you are a British national who lives permanently within the EU, or have been in another EU country for some time before travelling on to Greece, you may be asked to prove that you have not recently travelled from the UK.After testing, you will need to self-isolate at the address given on your PLF form, filled out prior to your arrival in Greece. You will be contacted by the Greek authorities with your test results, and given further instructions (e.g. whether you are free to leave your accommodation, or must self-isolate for a longer period). If your test result is negative, you will no longer need to self-isolate. If your test result is positive, the Greek authorities are likely to ask you to self-isolate in government-provided accommodation for 14 days.You must comply with all instructions given by the Greek authorities. Failure to do so may result in you being refused permission to enter Greece and/or legal enforcement.You should also be aware that if other passengers on your [flight](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g189398-…) subsequently test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek Authorities’ requirements.British nationals are not affected by the European Union’s measures to close EU borders to non-EU country nationals. If you’re a British national, you can still enter Greece, but you must comply with the Greek authorities’ requirements, including on testing and self-isolation."
"Welcome to Greece!Beginning July 1, 2020, the Greek government has determined how the country will welcome travelers, carry out the necessary diagnostic screening and keep everyone safe throughout the season.The Passenger Locator Form (PLF) is a key element in the planning. As of July 9th 2020, all travelers must complete their PLF at least 24 hours before entering the country, providing detailed information on their point of departure, the duration of previous stays in other countries, and the address of their stay while in Greece. In case of multiple stays, they are required to provide the address for the first 24 hours at least.Travelers will receive a confirmation email upon submission of the PLF.Travelers will receive the PLF with their unique Quick Response (QR) code on the day of their scheduled arrival in Greece (at midnight) and will be notified via email (the QR code will be provided in a link in the confirmation email).The PLF can also be found on the Visit Greece app and at travel.gov.gr.It is strongly recommended that all visitors download the Visit Greece app (GDPR compliant) for free, prior their arrival in Protocol for air arrivals(top)Arrival at the entry gate.Transfer to the area where the screening personnel are located. Travelers are requested to show their QR code either on their mobile phone screen or in print. If travel departure begins prior to the day of arrival, travelers are allowed to board after showing the confirmation email (and not necessarily the QR code which is scheduled to arrive during their trip.)Depending on their QR code/confirmation, travelers are directed either to the screening area where they will be tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by a trained health team or to the exit (to baggage claim area or passport control).Upon completion of the test, travelers are directed towards the exit (to baggage claim area or passport control).The test results are expected to become available within 24 hours. During that time, passengers who are tested are advised to practise social distancing according to local guidelines and self monitoring for symptoms that could indicate COVID-19. In case of such symptoms, medical advice and/or contact with the National Public Health Organization (EODY) Operations Centre should be immediately sought. Only in case they test positive, the authorities will contact them and proceed with the health protocol in place. Otherwise, they may continue with their holidays, adhering to the general public health safety guidelines.If travelers plan to have multiple stop-overs in Greece, they must declare this and report their initial destination and their travel itinerary for the next 7 days.All travelers must comply with all of the necessary preventive hygiene measures (use of masks and physical distancing) according to local guidance."
Nothing on this to suggest if someone on the plane test positive people near them have to quarantine.
"H.D.H. Sorry but these are the facts, which are changing all the time, and surely it is important that everybody is fully aware and therefore under no misunderstandings of what the Greek Authorities have introduced to help safeguard its citizens and visitors."
"Thanks all. Its the paragraph that reads ""if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive, you may (must confess I read this as ""will"") be subject to further quarantine/self isolation"" etc etc. which prompted my initial comments. No beach, no tavernas, no Mango bar H.D.H.!! I also wonder how the good people of The Mani feel about people from the UK arriving anyway. They have done such a good job keeping this thing under control that they must be concerned when they read our statistics. Petervalbarnes probably has insight into that."
"I read this on tanea.grSo if during testing a positive case is identified on the plane do i have to isolate? Well it all depends on how close you were to the person during the flight How is close contact (high exposure risk) defined with a COVID-19 cases A person who has had direct physical contact with a patient with COVID-19 (eg handshake) A person with unprotected contact with infectious secretions patient with COVID-19 A person who had contact with a person in the same room as the suspect A person who had “face to face” contact with a patient with COVID-19 at a distance of <2 meters and for ≥ 15 minutes A person who remained indoors with a patient with COVID-19 at a distance <2 meters and for ≥ 15 minutes A passenger on the same aircraft, who was sitting at a distance of two rows of seats (in each direction) from the patient with COVID-19 infection, people traveling together or caring for the patient and crew members who served the specific part of the aircraft where the patient was sitting.You have to think about how effective the PLF and testing system is.Your average holiday jet has nearly 200 passengers on board, just plain old randomly testing would be like playing ""find the lady"" with 200 cards!So they will likely use a combination of the information on the PLF and perhaps a temp scanner at the airport to identify subjects to test.So arrive with all sweaty with a temperature from say Leicester after a visit to the US last week and you will be tested.If the result is positive the rest of the flight will likely be contacted and asked where they were seated, if you were close enough you'd have to quarantine."
"Carol H Hi, I cannot speak on behalf of the people of the Mani but of course Hoteliers/Accommodation/Taverna/Kafenion Owners will welcome the potential extra revenue of tourists. As the Mani has stayed Covid free (at the moment) naturally there is an element of apprehension concerning tourists not only from the U.K. but also from other countries. The lockdown in Greece was very strict including form or SMS to leave your property, restriction on travel and number allowed in a vehicle, beaches closed etc and immediate 150€ fines for any breaches of the restrictions.The Greek Authorities have implemented measures that they deem to be necessary for the protection of citizens and visitors. I am sure any visitors will still enjoy their holidays all be it maybe slightly different to previous years but still good food, hospitality and sunshine.Unfortunately this week Mon - Weds there were 77 visitors who tested positive for Covid (mainly on the land border with Bulgaria) which has prompted the Prime Minister to state that next Monday he may well introduce new measures, all we can do is wait and see what they will be."
Carol H - we too are planning to travel to Greece in September.Things are changing all the time and it's 8 weeks or so before we plan to go.The worse thing for me would be if I had to be quarantined. Having said that I could just as easily be quarantined at any point here in the UK.Keeping up to date with the facts is important but at the same time as trying to get that information I am also trying not to get overtaken by the scaremongering that is appearing on some of the threads on the forums. Not on this one though!Thanks to the posters for putting the facts down.
