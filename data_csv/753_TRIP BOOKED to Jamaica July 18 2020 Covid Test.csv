Guys quick question I have a trip planned to Jamaica in about 1 week will I have to get a Covid Test before my Trip to Jamaica in order to board the plane and vacation in Jamaica?. I know I might be tested at the Airport in Montego Bay once we arrive. So do I need a Covid Test prior to my arrival in Jamaica
"Of course you should be tested, do you understand how prevent it is in F.....Florida?Please your own country wouldn't want you to move to another state.What are you looking for better weather ?"
I have been tested negative about 1 month ago my question was will another test be required before I enter Jamaica. That's my question is it REQUIRED before my arrival into Jamaica
"In order to ensure a hassle-free journey, visitors from high-risk areas (such as Florida, New York, Arizona and Texas) must be pre-tested before entry for arrivals from July 15, 2020 onward. If you are visiting from a high-risk area, you will be required to upload a negative test result (no more than seven days old) here prior to arrival. We encourage all guests to continue to check the same link for the most updated information and to ensure smooth sailing for their trip to our resorts."
Thank You
"Yes a negative test within the last ten days is needed as you are from a high risk areaMy cousin flew in from Florida a day ago, had a negative test prior and wasn’t tested on landing in JamaicaEdited: 4:40 pm, July 10, 2020 "

"Jamaica reopened last month and requires that visitors undergo COVID-19 testing upon arrival at the airport. Travelers must stay at their hotel or resort for at least 24-48 hours while they await their test results. ""If a traveler tests positive for COVID-19 on arrival, the person will be isolated in a public health facility for a minimum period of 14 days, or until they are able to produce two consecutive negative tests in a 48-hour period,"" said Donovan White, Jamaica's Director of Tourism."
"Myself and my girlfriend are getting Covid tested tonight. My neighbor is also coming he claims that he can still board the plane in Florida and just wait to get tested in Jamaica is their any truth to that?. He does not have to get tested before he leaves Florida that he can just wait and be tested at the airport in Jamaica. Please adviseEdited: 6:07 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"I don't think they will let you board a flight for Jamaica without the test, again contact the airline and ask."
Negative test results will be required to be uploaded before you can get your travel authorization document if you are from a hot spot.Everyone must apply for an authorization document 3 days before you leave. Only hot spot travelers are required to pre test.
We usually stay for a week. only. Sounds like a problem for us. Also how and where can we get 2 tests before departure and ow much? Not sure worth thr trip.
"""Jamaica reopened last month and requires that visitors undergo COVID-19 testing upon arrival at the airport"".As of recently the policy in Jamaica regarding testing at the airport has changed - they will only test you there if you are considered high-risk.Edited: 10:44 am, July 11, 2020 "
I did not have my test back in time for flight they would not let me check in without I am in Arizona hot spot .I called airport and airport was told no test no check in.
"I'm sorry John, thank you for giving us your information.I wish you all the best, stay healthy.I spoke to my friend in Jamaica tonight, they are aware US is putting them at risk.If we would all stay home a little longer.It's low season, we shouldn't put high season at risk, but for the power.That's reasonable right?"
"According to visitjamaica.com (where you apply for your Travel Authorization), you have to not only have a negative COVID test prior to departure if you're from a high risk area (ie Florida), but it is supposed to be from a College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited medical laboratory. You cannot be approved for your Travel Authorization until you upload a copy of the test result, and you cannot board the plane without showing your approved Travel Authorization. Furthermore, if you do come from a high risk area that requires showing proof of a negative test result, it can take up to 2 days for your authorization to be approved once you apply for it (whereas normally they only take about 10 mins)."
"This website is operated by the Jamaica Tourist Board and has the latest information and frequently asked questions. https://www.visitjamaica.com. Visitors from high-risk states in the US are required to have a travel authorization from the site in order to board a plane going to Jamaica. In order to get the travel authorization, visitors from the high-risk states in the US are required to upload a negative test result, in order to get the approved travel authorization. Your neighbor would not be able to board the plane without the pre-test if traveling from a high-risk state. Here is a statement from the landing page on the site...Beginning July 15, all non-business travelers 12 years of age and over, from Arizona, Florida, New York, and Texas in the USA will be required to upload a negative COVID-19 PCR test result from a College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited medical laboratory. The date of the test must be within 10 days of the arrival date in order to obtain a Travel Authorization."
"Please..No disrespect, I am sure that the majority of you traveling now like the casinos. We are not a good gamblers...on most occasions we do not win!! How the hell can any body travel now only.... looking after themselves only .. Seems selfish... Its like shooting craps. I have to say after traveling for 20 + years my wife and I will wait!! One day we will win the big one, until then I will keep our hands close to the heart. You all have fun!!!Edited: 6:02 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"""How the hell can any body travel now only.... looking after themselves only .. Seems selfish...""Talk to me when YOU have a seriously ill family member 3,000 miles away from you that you must go tend to.Please keep your judgements to yourself."
"Hey. I am actually on vacation here until the 18th. I really hate seeing people be given bad information or what they “think” is happening. Here is MY experience. You need a travel authorization form which you fill out 72 hours before you trip. I recommend keeping a couple copies of it with you on your trip. I had my temp check before I boarded and after I landed in Montego Bay. They do the expected “are you feeling sick or have been around anyone sick” questionS. They do NOT give you any type of actual test other than the questions. No cotton swabs. Nothing. All this nonsense about you receiving your “results” within 2 days is silly. Even talking to others from other resorts, nobody was tested more than a few questions and a temp check. Any other questions feel free to ask.Edited: 7:08 pm, July 13, 2020 "
Thanks for the update on your experience. Do you have to stay within your resort or Are you to walk the beach and go to other restaurants and have drinks at beach bars?
"It will all work out! I’m in TX and I was tested today. When I get results, I will apply 72 hours bf flight. Make sure your test is CAP certified. They now have a list on the site by state. My only concern at this point is the 2 day response after the 72 hour max application. Does anyone know if you can do at 12:01 am or does it have to coincide with time you arrive?"
Yes
"Pablo E. Where were you traveling from?Edited: 8:06 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"Pablo: Your experience is exactly as what is described in the posts in this thread so as it turns out - no one is giving out bad information.You weren't tested because you weren't deemed high risk and you didn't have to pre-test because you don't come from Florida, Texas, New York or Arizona.What I'm still fuzzy on is this ""stay on hotel property"" requirement so I too would like to know if you were told to not leave your resort property for your one week stay? Or is the requirement for a shorter period of time? Several first-hand reports that have come in (after July 10th when everything changed) have said that they were told to stay on their hotel property for their entire stay (one was four days, one ten days).It's funny - I'm sure people who normally never leave their resort are all of a sudden very interested in getting out to explore :)"
Hi hope you are enjoying your vacation. We are planning to travel on August 13th. I know nobody knows what things will be like then. Problem is I’m in pa and for now no testing is required. I can’t quarantine for 14 days. So I’m not sure what to do
"You should pre-test as close to your travel dates as possible for your own and others’ safety and so you have no surprises at the airport should they decide to test you, which they can do with any passenger they choose."
"Shelly - as far as the quarantine, I'm fuzzy on current protocols but it seems folks posting here first hand are saying they are being told to stay on their hotel property for their entire stay."
Well we got our Covid test done on Saturday July 11. Leave for Jamaica July 18 right now in Florida taking 5-7 business days to get the results back. Our back up plan if I don’t have my results back by Thursday July 16 will be Punta Cana. No covid test needed but temp check boarding and arriving in DR fingers crossed at this point.
"Thank you this is helpful. I'm planning to fly to Kingston in a few weeks from Canada, I'm aware the authorization form needs to be completed before arrival! Wish me luck, safe travels!"
"Quick tip... I'm in a similar situation awaiting for test results, and the results were most likely going to come from Lab Corp. My husband found this page on Lab Corp's site, and there is a link to request a status of your results. Hours later we got an email that my results were available through my login on the Lab Corp site. My husband's results are still pending, but he's not traveling. Give this link a try, it can't hurt :) https:/…patient-information"
I tested on Monday and got my results today! Negative of course. I went to an urgent care in the Houston area and used my insurance. The lab they use is bio reference which is CAP approved.Hope this helps other texans and other states.

So sorry you are so angry. Happy Travels!
"Lorna, seriously I'm not picking on you - many Canadians are not informed about our poor excuse of a healthcare system and once they are they smack their heads at our country's stupidity....""You felt you where so important that you went to urgent care?""""Urgent Care"" here has nothing to do with urgency - it's basically a clinic and in many cases charge less for ""stuff"" (like Covid tests). Because our testing situation is as bad as it is (and I'm sure way worse in ""hot spot"" states like mine) if you need/want a test you have to actually work all the angles to find a place that is taking appointments, use a lab (now) that is CAP approved AND with a reasonable expectation that you will get the results back in a timely manner. Urgent care centers are often places people go (a friend who was directly exposed went to one in Marin County here in Cali). ""They"" say you don't have to be symptomatic - but truth is, unless you are going to a county testing site you DO have to say you have symptoms or that you have been in direct contact with an infected person. Hey - I lied - told them I had a sore throat just to get a damn test so I could try to protect my 65 year old husband. So it had nothing to do with Robin being ""important"" in her choice of going to that Urgent Care - as it turns out she got her results super quickly.Here I am, having gone through my doctor's office, having had to lie to get a test and it's the end of Day 8 and I STILL don't have my results.Insert head-smacking emoji here."
"Thanks. Actually my doctor doesn’t give COVID tests, I was referred to the urgent care CLINIC where I had to make an appointment, it took 3 days to get an appointment after I filled out paperwork online. I did not have any symptoms and told them that. The key is to select a clinic with a lab that is local so they don’t have to send it out of state. Hope this helps others in high risk areas."
"Well took my covid tests almost 6 days ago results still not back yet. looking at plan B now Punta Cana or Cabo have up until Friday at 6pm to decide. No covid test required but temp screenings and masks required. Would be disappointed not to travel to Negril have been for 10 straight years now.Edited: 11:55 am, July 16, 2020 "
"I hope it all works out for you! I believe you got caught up in processes changing for your dates. Wherever you go, enjoy. Robin"
Thanks 7 days later no Covid results going to Punta Cana instead
Tymas I'm waiting 10 days now for my results - my quarantine ends tommorow it's anyone's guess as to whether I have/had Covid or not.
Have a great time!!!!
"Rasta-A passenger into Barbados tested negative upon arrival had to quarantine for 7 day per the protocol and test again at 5-7 days. They tested negative the 2nd time. Normally they would be ""let go"" but because they sat in close proximity to a passenger that tested positive on that second test they held onto them and tested them a 3rd time and at day 11 they too tested positive.. do not know if they had symptoms but I believe they did not. You are most likely fine so many days out but it's an example of it really can go that long with out showing up, or there were one or two false negatives earlierEdited: 6:28 pm, July 17, 2020 "
I live in Jamaica would be nice to hang out with you guys if that's ok with you...I'm 18 just needs some friends to go out with enjoy ourselves
Barbados has the right idea - maybe a little over-kill in this one guest's case. But it also has more money than Jamaica so they can do that type of PROPER testing (we can't even get that together here in the US).My test results came back 11 days after I got swabbed. Negative. But disgraceful the way things are being handled and now I hear my county is running out of supplies.
visit Jamaica site said you can do the authorization form w/in 5 days of departure.
"Curious how your stay in Jamaica was. What area did you stay in? If you've been before, what was different? Heading there in 3 weeks."
How was the process coming back to US? Were you mandated to quarantine?
Can you tell me how you managed to get a covid test and receive the results within 10 days of travel. And also upload those results to the visit Jamaica website to apply for a travel authorisation which can take up to 2 days to process?I have tickets booked to travel on Aug 17th.It seems that the only way to do this & get the covid test results in time to travel is to get a test 14 ish days before travel rather than the requested 10.. Would be interested to hear what your experience was with that.Thanks
You need to get tested 10 days bf. I went to an urgent care in Houston. Got results in 2 days. Uploaded results 5 days bf travel date. Got approval in 20 hours. Robin
"Robin, we're also in TX and the testing is giving me anxiety! What kind of test did you request at Urgent Care? I'm hearing there's 2 different types and you have to be sure to get the correct one? Thanks for any help!"
excelurgentcare.comThe lab is bioreference Laboratory The test was Covid-19 nasalGo on their site to see if has locations near you.
You can also check cap.org
"Dear UXdesigner,You need to get a PCR or PCR-RT test - it detects actual virus from an active infection. Not an antibody test - it detects if you were infected in the past. Not an antigen test - this is the most common ""Fast"" test. The PCR test is based on a mucus sample typically taken from your nose but sometimes from your throat."
"Robin, just wanted to thank you for sharing your Houston experience! We’re still hoping we will be able to travel to Jamaica later this year from there so I’ve saved this info.I went through the county testing experience several weeks back and there’s no way that would work with the required timeline for Jamaica."
Great!
Thank you so much for your clarification. We are scheduled to leave on August 21 from Boston and you clarified our concerns. Enjoy your stay.!!
Yes you need an approved covid test and a visit jamaica.com travel authorization to board your flight. You could be tested again and quarantined when you arrive. Go to travel jamaica.com to see details.
