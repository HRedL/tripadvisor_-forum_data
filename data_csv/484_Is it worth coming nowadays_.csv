Hi question for travellers who just been there or for residents of budapest. Do you think it is worthwile coming for a city trip? we are with 8 guys around 25 years of age and we planned this city trip a half year ago but i'm now seriously doubting to fly and stay there in budapest if it's not worthwile. appreciate if someone can give me an opinion :)Thanks
Where from ?abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/…
We are from Belgium but that doesn't matter. i'm just asking if we can enjoy everything that budapest has to offer in these times or do you suggest to come back when more is open and safe.
"It depends on what you want to do. For sightseeing, walking in the city and do the ""regular"" touristy things maybe it's a good time. Akmost everything is open and available, with small restrictions (face mask, for example). For parties, having fun, nightlife - I'm not sure."
"I did spend last weekend in Budapest. Indeed for sightseeing fine, nightlife is more quite than usual. Bar are mostly open and you can easily go out for a few drinks."
Now is the best time to travel to enjoy the city without the usual crowds of tourists.
"Yes, if you want to see the city it is the right time, no crowds. Restaurants, bars , shopping centers, even baths are open but no concerts, no festivals. I would say life is normal here apart from the fact that you have to wear a mask in public transport and in supermarkets, but that's all.And your country is in the green list, so you won't have a problem at the airport with quarantining."
"Hi,for some kind of cultural voyage yes, it is probably the best time ever. You will have the city almost to yourself.But taking into consideration that your age is in the 25 years zone, I can guess you are looking for some kind of ""action"" which is almost absent this year.They just have announced today the cancellation of all those absolutely stupid (during these very hard and serious times), burning money attractions like the August 20 fireworks.They wanted to make it the largest money burning event in Corona stricken Europe, fortunately not anymore.Already more than 90,000 people have signed the petition for cancellation and sense of reason has won, however I am pretty much sure there was fear of getting a sudden explosion of infections. You can not organize a hundred thousand people standing at a safe distance from each other.All the festivals have been cancelled (max 500 people allowed) and the list goes on. Also looking at today's trend of (Again) growing infection numbers in many European countries (like in your country https:/… ), I am not sure they will not introduce a new ban for entering the country. Such is reality, nothing is certain today..."
"Can I assume the cancelations include Octoberfest, 2020?Pjk"
"PJK,If the government here is going to give in that easily on the Szent István nap , it is a good guess that the Oktoberfest's cancellation is an eventual formality.Based on my experiences and observances, it is my belief that the local Budapesters are pretty nonchalant about Covid. Between the semi-obligingly wearing of masks and coughing and blowing their nose trumpet as enthusiastically as Dizzy Gillespie indoors, and more than a few attributing ""Magyar superiority"" as to why Hungary is relatively unscathed, and with some of our neighbors getting recent flare ups.I really hope that I am wrong but there's a good chance that it is only a matter of time before Hungary has its second wave come this fall or winter. But, at least in my opinion, Oktoberfest in Budapest is a facsimile of a facsimile of the bona fide München Oktoberfest. I only went to the first one, which was not professionally run, but it had some ragged and unique charm. In recent years in has changed venues a couple times and from what I have heard, it lost that charm. But the question should be: is it worth coming to Budapest in the fall? It could very well be, but not necessarily for Budapest's Oktoberfest.I hopes this helps."
"The simple true is that Hungary was not hit by the virus so strong as many other countries. 99% of the population has not experienced anything from the virus just the consequences of the virus. We stayed at home in March and April, had a responsible attitude, wearing mask, keeping distance..etc But it is true that for now we have our normal life back. There is nothing wrong with it.Accoriding toi the Octoberfest: As we are not living in an isolated island the cancellation of it will depend on what is going on in Europe. Nobody knows now anything for October. The August 20th festives would have been within a month, and actually there was a big protest against it so I am not sure if it was cancelled only by the virus..."
"pjk, given that they have just officially cancelled August 20th - 5 weeks away - it may be September before they officially cancel Oktoberfest: but the organisers may decide long before that. Watch their website, I suggest."
"We were using Oktoberfest, 10/1 to 10/4, to kind of set the dates for a trip. We'd spend a week in Prague first, then a week in Budapest ending on that weekend. And we figured Oktoberfest would be a change from the Wine Festival. But at this point we'd settle for any chance for time in the city. We've always found plenty to do - old favorite things and new discoveries - and the typically great food and drink. Sadly I doubt we will make Europe this year, but we can be ready to go in a heartbeat.Thanks, all. and stay well.Pjk."
"I was at Oktoberfest maybe for both the years we lived there. Outside of serving German beer it is indistinguishable from the various food truck festivals they have there (at the horse track). This is a festival that is totally dependant on weather as there are very few tourists/foreigners...if it is cold and rainy as is common in October, it will be empty."
"We stopped at the funnel cake festival last year. We walked around and took in the various stands, each had a froccs, then took off. Pjk"
Bars/restaurants are open. Open air concerts are on. Walking tours are no problem. Spas maybe still closed. Museums are open too. Nightlife is not back to normal yet;)
