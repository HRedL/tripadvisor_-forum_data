"This is by a real estate firm in Colliers. It paints what might be an optimistic projection for foreign (inbound) tourist numbers to Philippines in calendar 2020 given the decline in hotel occupancy rates Covid-19 is causing:https:/…coronavirus-and-philippine-tourismAt this stage no one knows whether this disease will become a pandemic and last for many months (or even years) or whether it's less serious. Hard though to see inbound tourism quickly recovering and increasing '10 to 20 per cent' (compared with the second half of 2019) in July to December 2020. There's been so much negative publicity that it may take a while before many travellers start booking major holidays, while business travel is also adversely affected at present.There's always a lag effect as people generally don't book the day before if travelling from overseas, but weeks or months in advance. And while numbers of foreigners visiting Philippines in 2019 during the traditional 'off season' of July to November saw a substantial rise, the fact remains it's still 'low season' when typhoons are more likely."
"You could also expect a substantial drop in 2020 due to legislation passed in Dec 2019 prohibiting the tens of thousands of Chinese workers namely in the POGO and construction industries, arriving into the Philippines on tourist visas.This will also ensure more jobs for local Filipinos and reflect a more true account of incoming bona fide tourists in 2020."
"The Covid-19 coronavirus has more effect to Thailand,Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia in tourism numbers than the Philippines.The Philippines is the less visited places in south east asia by the Chinese. If you want to be infected by the Covid-19 coronavirus, go to Thailand, they did not impose ban on Chinese visitors. https:/…https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/co…Edited: 1:22 pm, February 17, 2020 "

"not sure about that,...they locked down manila and the province of bohol"
Just learned that ALL incoming passengers arriving into New Zealand including NZ citizens shall suffer mandatory quarantine for 14 days.Cruise ships also banned until end of June.Hopefully Australia can do the same in order to stop this disease spread.
