"""Will Japan really be ready to be the host of *2020* Olympics, which they agree *comes* as early as 2021 summer? And/Or will participating countries be able to send their delegates/teams then?""With the new news maybe a vaccine will be around in January it is a big possibility now."
"I wouldn't have my hopes on the Olympics. Reality check. Unless there's a miracle vaccine that is discovered, it's going to take awhile.https:/…"
"The 1980 Olympics was not cancelled. It was boycotted by several nations, but it still went ahead. The 1976 and 1984 games also experienced boycotts.Edited: 6:14 pm, May 02, 2020 "
"Summer Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 (Berlin) and 1940 (Tokyo). Winter games were canceled in 1940 (Sapporo) and 1944 (Cortina d'Ampezzo). Under the current situation around the world, my guess is Tokyo will be canceled in 2021, and Beijing 2022 can be boycotted."
"""Under the current situation around the world, my guess is Tokyo will be canceled in 2021""I think 2021 will be ok as long as the vaccine is found by January and available by March for everyone."
"I can't believe what I'm reading. Olympics cancelled in 2021? Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine. Why does everyone want a vaccine? Because you listen to Bill Gates, Dr Fauci and the New York Times. You are being deceived. With the vaccine comes your digital tattoo and mark of the beast Microsoft biometrics. All you need is HydroxychloroQUINE - quinine. On March 10 1945, 90000-100000 people died in the bombing of Tokyo. Next day they were out cleaning up and getting on with life. 517 have died in Japan and you are so fearful...."
"As far as I read here opinions by the experts, including executive members of Japan Medical Association, most people are not that optimistic about the implementation of the virus vaccine in spring 2021. The fastest simulation is currently in late summer till early autumn. Very fast implementation may include side effect. When the organizing committee chair said there would be no second postpone, everyone here understands it will be implied to be a cancel."
