"Hi all,After recommendations for afternoon tea post lockdown for myself, the hubby and our daughter who will be twenty one. We will be spending the day, (which will be a Monday) in London shopping in and around Oxford Street and Borough Market. Then afternoon tea, We're happy to splash out as it is for a special birthday, the venue I'm open to ideas, for us the food must be amazing with a nice ambiance, later on we intend to go to the Shard for a drink at Sunset and then make our way home, Many thanks for any information given."
I hope your Daughter is only 19 just now!I can’t see any of your plans being fulfilled in the next 6 months!
madscotsman not sure I said it was in the next six months..........
"The best afternoon tea I've had is at the Savoy. Very formal atmosphere in some ways, but I found the service very friendly and the entire setting and presentation to be elegant. (And I don't remember being disappointed by the food.) Second-best is the Renaissance St. Pancras, more for the atmosphere and service, although the food is very good.Future results, of course, may vary."
Had afternoon tea at Fortnum & Mason a few months ago . Very smart room and would happily return for more food.
Not sure if you have seen this -https:/…best-afternoon-teas-london
"Madscotsman that made me laugh out loud. Tough thing to do these days :-)Sorry Yvonne, no disrespect but it was a snappy reposte :-)"
"The OP doesn't indicate when the trip to London is scheduled/planned. Your daughter's birthday may likely have to be celebrated at home before a trip to London is possible.And sorry, with all due respect, what 21 year old daughter wouldn't want to hop on a train with friends and stay in London overnight to celebrate, enjoying music, food, drinks, etc. in London pubs??"
"I too would choose the Savoy for both the food and the ambience. An alternative to the Shard may be a drink at the Sky Garden if that's of interest to your daughter.This thread may attract one of the forum's usual suspects, who will comment about the ownership of the Savoy or any other venue, the income of those who frequent such places, may provide a website that will have nothing to do with the matter at hand, and will denigrate some choices and praise others as a cack-handed attempt to demonstrate superiority. You'll know the post when you see it."
My favourite is Browns on Albemarle Street - it is convenient for Oxford Street (close to the bottomend of Bond Street) and is a proper traditional AT.
"No problem, thank you"
Claridges for me
When it comes to A/T I'm a traditionalist. However on this occasion your daughter might enjoy this one.www.onealdwych.com
"We have done many Afternoon Teas, and all have been good, albeit different.For a special celebratory Afternoon Tea, my choice would ne The Dorchester, in the Promenade.Enjoy,Hunt"
"Hmmmm for a 21 year old, I would suggest the Madhatter's Tea Party at the Sanderson, I went in my early 20s and loved it. Alternatively, how about Afternoon Tea at Sketch? I went just before the lockdown and it was full of trendy 20-somethings."
to Yvonne Camberley 1] have not been to Savoy for tea for some time thus I will not encroach upon more illustrious contributor 2]Browns hotel belongs to Rocco Forte excellent choice. building has character. 3] has two entrances in two different streets Concierge staff jokingly told me once probably apocryphal story thereof  url here informative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_PolizziIn the Bar famous photographer Donovan has a exhibit of photos is worth a quick peek  Enjoy regmaiche
Ah it feels almost like a return to normality having an afternoon tea question on TALF again......I can dream....
"verve80 lol asking questions like this in anticipation of post lockdown is what is keeping me going, and I'm a key worker working with people that have COVID-19 so I am getting out to work. I want some normality back, but not too soon, as a second wave of COVID-19 would be awful...... I can dream too....xEdited: 11:46 am, May 08, 2020 "
"Many thanks for the amazing recommendations, they all look wonderful.Many thanks Traveller Plus for the Sky Garden, recommendation, that looks amazing, will definitely go there. Thanks DavidJ, I will try the savory afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason once lockdown ends as I have never had that before.DESK29 thanks for the link for the various afternoon teas :) Many thanksto you all for taking the time to help me and my hubby, the afternoon teas all look so lovely and different, I really appreciate the time you have taken.we got some difficult, albeit extremely yummy decisions to make, will come back at a later date once we have decided where to go, altho' I can see us doing afternooon teas on various future trips to London.Edited: 12:00 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"Yvonne - me too - just dreaming of the time I can hug my grandchildren again after eight weeks and see my son in London. By the way, about four years ago, my mum, daughter and I had a fab afternoon tea at the Landmark Hotel on Marylebone Rd. The sandwiches (which they kept bringing til we were bursting), bottomless cups of tea and little patisseries were delicious and there was a pianist playing too. It was served in the huge centre courtyard (glazed, so indoors) and the staff were lovely - a real treat."

used to he HQ of British Rail poor location on main road out of Londonexcellent pianist obviously used to classics so her programme playing modern bit stilted.I lunch there when going to St Mays Hospital;  https:/…history.phpregmaiche
"My favourite is the Wolseley. Its a good price, compared to many of the London top end offering and feels suitably luxurious without a stuffy atmosphere. https://www.thewolseley.com/I've been there a couple of times and actually thinking of buying a voucher to go back when they are able to reopen, to help them out during these times.Edited: 5:13 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"The Wolsley was Michael Winners favourite too, oh bleater of the night...."
Many thanks for coming back and saying thanks.And a very happy twenty first to your daughter.
1]Landmark used to be HQ of British Rail noisy location on main road exit from London like race track but for traffic lights 2] the pianist is vg . I go there sometimes 5 times a year en route to/from St Marys Hospital3]nostalgia url https:/…history.php regmaiche
The Wolsley is great too owned by Corbin & King famous restauranteurs  re MW I was guest at some ridiculously overpriced restaurant and saw MW waving his napkin like a banner as receiving no attention from Maitre d 2] there is a shortage of characters on today's sceneregmaiche
"Hello Yvonne - such a good idea to give your family something to look forward to, when circumstances change, whenever that may be. Though not a formal afternoon tea, I could recommend the biscuiteers for tea and a selection of the most amazing iced biscuits. There is also a lovely bakery in Bloomsbury - can't remember the name but it's pale pink and on Instagram posts so you'll soon find it. Fine dining afternoon teas do seem to be overrated (and overpriced) in my opinion so I couldn't really recommend any of them."
