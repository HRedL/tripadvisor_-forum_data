"Hi, I am looking to hopefully travel to vegas from Manchester uk in May 2021 for mine and husbands 5th wedding anniversary.I am struggling to find package flight and hotels?? TUI dont seem to show any packages for may.. virgin from london are coming in around £1300 per person for 5 nights? Seems excessive? Should I book flights and hotel separate? What prices are flight only normally? Any help appreciated:) thank you"
"Tui don't do package deals to Vegas. Virgin Holidays will be your best bet, have you tried flying from Manchester or checking expedia?"
It’s simply too early for May 2021.A package deal gives you ABTA protection which you don’t get with booking hotels and flights separately.If you do the latter you need good travel insurance that covers travel disruption to ensure you are covered for any shutdownsAt the best of times it’s impossible to predict future flight prices and even more so for May 2021 - who knows which airlines will be operating and what routes they will service.Don’t forget travel insurance - the price of a good policy in the future could be a nasty shock to many
"Book flights and hotel separately, and directly with the airline and hotel. The advantage of a package will be reduced cost. I wouldn't do a package unless there was a £200 - £300 pp saving.Try something like Skyscanner to get an idea of cheap flights, then check the airline's website to see how much extra a direct booking would be with the airline."
Definitely too early for May 2021.And book separately. And make sure hotel can be cancelled. If a better hotel offer becomes available....you can jump on it
Virgin Atlantic only announce flights 11 months in advance. Because of this Virgin holidays mostly book the same time frame. Probably be around July before you can book for May 2021.That is if international travel is allowed and if Vegas does reopen.
"In normal times you should be able to get economy flights from Manchester to Vegas in May for less than £500pp, but who knows what will happen now....Hotel pricing can vary widely depending on dates, but if flexible you should be able to get a decent hotel for a few hundred pounds for 5 nights."
Travel restrictions will be in place for some time until a vaccine is available. You may also not be protected by travel insurance as I’m sure this will become an exclusion.
"""Travel restrictions will be in place for some time until a vaccine is available."" - That's just your opinion, nobody knows yet what restrictions will be in place for May 2021."
Hi. As a fellow U.K. traveller definitely book separate. It’s too early at the moment. For may 21 it’s going to be at least September this year before best to book. Just keep an eye on Skyscanner. For hotels I use a search engine like booking.com then book direct with the hotel. Always best. Enjoy. Going to be there maybe April or perhaps a June in 2021. Good travels.
"Becky, give Barrhead Travel a try."
"Hi Becky - we have done seperate bookings and packages over the years, whatever is cheaper. We flew from London with BA and stayed at the Luxor for £550pp last year - so packages can be good value (remember with a package or individually you will likely still have to pay a resort fee of around $45 per night ontop of whatever prices you see).For info, we booked our cheap package in the BA sale which starts late July. The Virgin sale is the same time.Obviously the current situation will have a profound impact on demand and pricing - but I would look once the sales start (Manchester is usually even cheaper than flying from London!)."
"""Travel restrictions will be in place for some time until a vaccine is available.""What is your source for that information ?"
Anyone with common sense shouldn’t book until they know they can travel. Anyone who needs a source for that I don’t know what to tell you.
As mentioned it is a bit too early for May 2021.I have done packages and booked separately for Vegas.I would lean on booking flights and a refundable hotel deal as a separate package.Get immediate travel insurance cover.I have no idea what the Coronavirus situation would be in a years time.
Becky. Be aware of resort fees when choosing hotel. They are quite clear on hotel websites just ensure factor in. If booking a package I would hope they are also included in the cost of the package. Never done that but assume - others will advise. The reason I don’t book a package and book direct with the hotel is I like to gamble low stakes. I usually get a little knocked off the bill when time to settle at the end of the hol. If using a package hol the hotel don’t have the scope to do that. Depends if you like to gamble a bit or not. I find the direct prices really competitive tho the 550 deal for flights and Luxor (bot my fave) someone mentioned in an earlier post is a very good deal so I get why it’s attractive.
Thank you all for your replies. I'll definitely look more towards Sept to book then :)
"Definitely too early! I'd say book separate, we got flights from Manchester > Amsterdam > Vegas for less with 500 each. Do your research on which hotels you'd be interested in and check on their website for prices, maybe look for a sale around holidays, black friday that type of thing for lower prices :)"
"If you plan to book hotel direct, sign up on-line for a players card. I think both MLife and Caesars will be offering great deals and you may get some offers to entice you to their respective properties."
"Try British Airways Holidays - we’ve booked a package with them many times, normally beat virgin on package deals."
"Packages have got more expensive this past few years, I've had a couple around £500 pp flights and hotel, ended up taking it for the flights alone and bunked the hotel off for comps I had in better hotels.These days I book separate as I travel more regularly and get better comps.Have you considered checking prices from Dublin, sometimes you can get good flight deals there plus you can do pre-clearance. You'd only need a cheap flight from MAN to DUB."
Seriously Don't book anything You have zero chance of getting travel insurance for the foreseeable future
"Hi Becky, I'm trying to book for March 2025 and running into the same problems."
"Definately too early,even taking account the current crisis. Since TC went bust Manchester prices have gone OTT in my opinion. If you can get yourself to London you are more likely to get a deal."
"William.One place to look for is Ramsay World Travel, They do some really good deals"
"There are great deals for 27th April on the virgin website, for a package, could you go then or is you date fixed?"
"Holiday Pirates are doing ridiculous deals at the moment for next year and late this year. Due to the lack of vaccine and the gates not being open to is yet, I haven’t took up that deal but for others it may be right for them."
I believe they will be making an anouncement on travel restrictions within the next week.
Mr.NiceGuyDo you have an official source for that or is it just a personal belief

"We're in the UK and flights from Man have shot through the roof .We always buy a package on Expedia as it's cheaper that way , but opted to take a chance that Virgin will still be around Jan next year ,and are flying from Heathrow as Man prices were loads more .Good luck ."
