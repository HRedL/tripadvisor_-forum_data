Does any recent travelers to Punta Cana have any news as to the topic at resorts there?
No reported cases at the moment ... https:/…
None.
The topic and discussion won’t be about the resorts but the impact at PUJ and potential arrival delays if they have to implement screening of inbound flights.

"If there were, would it be made public?Edited: 4:56 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"I know I don't have any posts really but I am an avid TA reader I really just like to keep to myself and certainly don't like to get involved in the political aspect. I just find it odd that someones first post ever would be about spreading unproven 3rd party info. I think Punta Cana has suffered enough in the last year.This is not a gossiping social media site but an informational advice for those looking for specific information from people that have first hand knowledge. So I think if you want to stir the pot maybe a facebook page is more suitable to your liking. Im sure if there is something with truth and fact someone with first hand knowledge will post, otherwise please try not to spread 3rd party gossip. People are spending thousands of dollars and would appreciate fact not fiction.Thats my 2 cents."
JennandJames ... exactly
Ok so could you share the article that you've read so we can see for ourselves what you are basing your facts on still strange that you just joined February of this month and felt compelled to share but can't back it up.Just sayingMaybe a troll in a better direction is in your future
"I was just asking if you could back up your claim, after keeping quiet for a year after seeing people bash DR I felt compelled to not silence myself. The difference between FB and TA is FB is more of a highschool BS gossiping site while TA is an informative fact based site. Like you commented to the pisters question whick was not directed at you personally, I commented as well to you, just asking you to provide readers with legitimate information. Like what paper it was published, date ect... thats how you give proper information and pass it on as knowledgeable fact based.Yes I need a vacation and will enjoy immensely, thank you fir your concerns"
"JennJames...I have read your multiple posts today with hilarity. If you honestly think this particular forum on TA is not without its high school BS: cliques; bullying and gossip, etc.you haven't been around long enough. I have watched as a few people were kicked off this forum, while a DE is spell and grammar checked posts.The OP asked a legitimate question, especially in light of what is currently happening at a hotel in the Canary Islands. Someone provided info they had seen and was removed. Removal of info happens all the time. Far be it for me to question her motives. Last year, I traveled to EEC, despite living in the thick of news coverage. I use the term ""news"" lightly.Inteestingly enough, EEC, with a 30% occupancy, there was a large amount of Chinese travelers and South American travelers. A frequent poster and local business man even described the visitors that replaced my narrow minded fellow Americans as ""worldly"". Therefore, I reiterate...any answer is postable. Yes, even your question and suggestion the poster was a troll is postable.Interesting: You spent the day with question after question boosting your count.For the record, I traveled to Mexico during the Swine Flu. I am 10 years older, with a weaker immune system, so I am keeping an eye this Corona Virus, and I am not easily swayed by hype."
"Yes I totaly get what you are saying and I totally believe the posters question is legitimate, I am very much watching this closely as I am visiting in April with my child I just want to make sure I am or wveryone is informed properly so we can avoid similar situations that have happened on this forum in the past year. Yes I definitely want to be informed if there are positive cases of this virus in the area. I don't think I was going out of bounds by asking where this info came from just want to make sure it is correct. I have used Trip Advisor since 2014 when we went to Sandals Montego Bay unfortunately I had me email account hacked and couldn't retrieve my TA account. Like I said I really don't post much and could give to chits about whether my post count goes up or not, but I do think this is a serious topic and just asking for legitimate sources. Was I wrong for that? Sorry if I offended."
"Jenn James, You have every right to ask for sources. But like your hacked account, articles can disappear. I was offended by the troll accusal.It was ugly on these forums last year. Misinformation, exaggerated info, actual info were all part of the daily postings by cheer leaders, business owners, those who played devil's advocate and those who wanted info.Some good things happened1. The Punta Cana Pledge, I believe Palladium is a part of itwww.puntacanapromise.com 2. Mandated security cameras, which had previously been mandatedI wish you a fab trip with your son. I remember how excited it was to take my then 11 year old, but now 25 year old on her first trip to MX. The ex took her to PC previously lol"
My apologies should have worded it differently. I get caught up at times when your trying to sift thru all the bs to get to the good. Ty for the well wishes for my trip my boy is so stoked. This will be his first tropical vacay I'll make sure to send off a toast while I'm lying on the beach absorbing the rays. The -50 we had was a lil hard this winter and I'm definitely looking a lil chalky to say the least.Cheers
"Thanks for the future toast and will return the toast hopefully, in October. Philadelphia has had a mild winter, but then again once we received over 2 feet in March many moons ago.Chalky? Chalky is a good thing, isn't it. lol Once I reached my 50's and realized my previous sun worshipping has costed me a small fortune in skin care products, I have convinced myself that SPF shirts and brimmed hats are cool. Speaking of SPF shirts...you might want to consider a surf shirt for your son."
"https:/… there are none as of today.Edited: 11:17 pm, February 25, 2020 "
https:/… here you will get updates. Hope it helps
just a week after I got back from 28 nights in Punta Cana I started with rotten man flu (I hope)
Agree with some others ... if the virus begins to occur in PC it will be hushed up very quicklyAs I find from reading this forum everything is always glorious in PC
Sunny...why are you so cloudy about Punta Cana? LOL
"I read the news every day here from multiple sources, in both English and Spanish (using google translate). There are no confirmed cases. Precautions taken? Yes. Confirmed cases....NO!There were 5 who were put under observation and found to test negative. In other words, they do not have the virus.https:/…1727868https://listindiario.com/la-republica/2020/0…https:/…20000013-4168779This is how misinformation starts. Usually with someone who joined a day ago, never to be heard from again, unless under a brand new name a day later, commenting on a sensitive subjectEveryone in this country is very aware of coronavirus, with it all over the news, plus through municipal awareness programs taking place. The same survailence of cases is taking place here as it is in most countries around the world."
"Thank you for the links to daily updates. I will also trust the sources from the WHO and the CDC. @Mike...I also read the same Dominican online newspapers. How can you trust the leaders when they cancel elections? How can you trust a system that has repeatedly not enforced its own tourism policies?Tourism is the staple of the economy. There is a great deal of investment and many palms have been greased to make a beautiful island a floating Disney experience.Imo, you have no credibility because you have an oar in the boat, your lively hood. You post a great deal of valuable info, but when the topic involves an effect on tourism, imo, you shouldn't be allowed to post. Your presence here ensures constant promotion for your business.For the record, I don't trust my own government either.Last but not least, calling out someone as a troll is the defense of someone who has run out of salient info.Let's not start another year of battles."
Thanks for the advice Philly.
Eloquently put PFF
WOW...the wrecking crew is back! LOL
Agreed - well done.
Welcome Andres...anything else to add?

@RJP...Thanks for the injection of brevity. I hope your wife and daughter have safe and enjoyable travels.@Zeeka...Indeed!
Well said n totaly agree!
Is it safe to travel there? Any coronavirus cases yet?
ZERO Coronavirus infections in the Dominican Republic. It is safe.

The Boston Globe reports it will not allow a cruise ship to dock for fear of Covid 19https:/…
The President of DR has ordered emergency provisions. YES THIS ARTICLE IS IN ENGLISHhttps:/…
This virus is so unfortunate for everyone....Within a couple or two months ~ I am hoping that some sort of antidote comes to lite.. optimism
"I whole heartedly agree Zeeka!IMO, Right now, we can protect ourselves with knowledge."
Agreed Zeeka...and if we can just figure out the common flu that kills 10's of thousands a year in North America (Canada and the US). Always hope for a solution. I am with you on that!
What I find amazing is how similar this is to the Flu and many people will refuse to get Flu shots. Even though Flu shots are not 100% it still helps.
That last heard was that any vaccine is many months away and the lead time may even reach into 2021 and even then at Mike has said no vaccine is 100% effective
Hopefully this is somewhat seasonal like the flu.

I also so this here is the link:https:/…
"I am booked to travel to Punta Cana in a few weeks, now very reluctant to go. All the resorts I went to, have guests from all over the world: Europe, Italy, Frensh, British and of course from US and Canada. Being on the resort, is better than being on a cruise, but involves lots of the same activities people gathering around the buffet, in restaurants and bars. Don't know how you can protect yourself in such environment. My reservation is non refundable, but I feel better losing my money than get stuck in a hospital or worst being quarantine. Love to hear from others who are in the same situation on trying to postpone these trips. Don't know if insurance companies will cover this situation unless there is an advisory not to go to DR."
"Corona virus is going to make its rounds probably everywhere but the main concerns is still the unknown but were you worried about the flu before this crisis hit? Can't live in fear. Watch for WHO travel warnings and adjust at that time if the warning goes to a high level.CDC estimates* that, from October 1, 2019, through February 22, 2020, there have been:32,000,000 – 45,000,000flu illnessesperson coughing icon14,000,000 – 21,000,000flu medical visitsdoctor patient icon310,000 – 560,000flu hospitalizationshospital room icon18,000 – 46,000flu deaths"
"I would think you may have more people from different countries in Ottawa!I was in Toronto for SARS, life went onIf you feel more comfortable cancelling that is a call you will have to make,probably what others are doing will not change your comfort leveland you are correct insurance companies are not providing refundsfor me I have multiple travel plans this year and 2 of them I have the option to cancel for any reason, I have no intentions of using that option"
First case of corona virus in domenican republic was reported today .
"i'm in the same boat - not sure how much of my trip would be refunded, we're supposed to head out 3/6 to 3/16. There are 4 of us (2 kids 2 and 4) and while i'm slightly worried about catching the virus (i'm currently pregnant) I'm more worried about getting stuck in quarantine - either on the island or when getting back home. I'm ok with staying in the house once I get back - but I can't imagine getting closed up for 14 days or whatever with 2 little kids.Also - my kids get random fevers from many things - stomach bug, change of environment - we might get quarantined inadvertantly. they're constantly picking up sniffles and coughs... i really don't know what to do. I hate to overreact but I'm really torn on what to do."
Just a follow up to my previous posts This reflects more for Canadian travellers who are considering cancelling trip https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus…
"To gosia4, Thanks for sharing, whether you go or stay, please provide us with your experience being there or dealing with the travel company."
"I’m not canceling but boy it’s only a matter of a few weeks when at least 80-90% of all countries around the world have at least a few cases.. bring your immune system fighters, exercise, hand sanitizer, and don’t panic. Remember, it’s mostly affecting those of advance age (50+) with a weak or fragile immune system.. otherwise you should be fine and likely to recover if you do by any chance contract something. DR’s warm tropical climate should help it, but scientists are still investigating this."
What resort Italian with carina virus stay
HiWe have 35 confirmed cases here in the UK so roll on our trip to PC in a few weeks time

Today it was announced the first case of corona virus in DR: https:/…article240781521.htmlWe are heading to Puna cana in 3 weeks. I am not sure what would happen by then.
Please keep in mind that the COVID-19 patient is from Italy...
Doesn't matter the originality of the patient. The problem is how many people would have been infected so far and they have remained unknown (COVID-19 can remain unknown for 2 week in the body of patient). I hope DR does a good job to contain infected people.
People who strictly adhere to the 5 second rule are immune to the Coronavirus-Facebook Medical :-)
The Italian traveler is being quarantined at a military base near Santo Domingo.
Does anybody know which resort was the Italian traveler?
viva Wyndham dominicus beach - I read on another thread - not sure how accurate that is
Link to report where the Italian traveller was staying.https:/…Angie.
"Two things: they say he didn't show any symptoms but obviously that doesn't mean he didn't have the virus before travelling (how long before symptoms appear?) and also, how long was he at the resort before symptoms did show up ( had he been there a while, there would be more risk of infecting others)? Seems like the resort did well in isolating and cleaning up after they isolated the patient though."
This really is the wrong forum as the traveler was not staying in Punta Cana at all and never traveled there. He was staying in Dominicus and flew into the airport near that area which is a couple of hours away from Punta Cana.
"@72Yes, but many of the other guests of that resort probably flew into Punta Cana and will be flying out of Punta Cana when they go home. I know when we stayed at Viva a few years ago, that was our itinerary.Some guest also fly into Santo Domingo for the Dominicus/Bayahibe area.Edited: 1:13 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"# 72, we were in Bayahibe last year. We landed in Punta Cana and we traveled by a van for 45 minutes to Bayahibe. He might very well landed in Punta cana. So it is quite relevant to this forum"
"Discover12 while some passengers do use both airports this particular passenger flew into the La Romana International Airport according to the government. Here is the link. He also was not technically in Bayahibe but just south in Dominicus. Here is the link verifying he flew into La Romana.https:/…Edited: 1:36 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"# 75, thanks for the clarification. There are many other issues that concerns me: that this person as I understand is taken to a military hospital, then who pays his expenses. He must have used the buffer for some of his meals, in close proximity to other guests, contaminating the buffet utensils and in contact with the servers and other employees. What happen then and how can you contain such contagious virus. I know they use hand synthesizer. Did he ever blow his nose or touched his face before handling the utensils???"
<< “I know they use hand synthesizer.” >>Now THAT’S funny.:-)
"Sorry, of Course I meant hand sanitizer."
Gotta love auto-corrupt.:-)
They have said in the resorts news release that the government had a special team come through with special sanitation equipment/chemicals to go over his room entirely. They also apparently are monitoring other people at the Viva Resort at Dominicus. Not sure if it means those people he came into contact with are quarantined or what exactly that means.
"Sorry if I am going over and over this issue. I am booked to go there in a couple of weeks. it is non refundable booking and insurance company would not refund any of the large sum of money I paid. So I am trying to quantify the risk of even just one person being infected with the virus. I cannot imagine what it would take to identify and monitor the hundreds of guests that came in contact with this one person. What about cleaning staff and reception staff,....what about disinfecting beach, pool and lobby chairs. Did he swim in the pool and would the pool require any treatment. I could go on and on of the many issues of one person in a resort being infected. I was at the RIU many many years ago and I was one of the victims of Norwalk virus at the resort, they eventually closed the resort for months before they were able to control the situation."
"Discover...""So far, the new coronavirus has led to more than 89,000 illnesses and 3,000 deaths worldwide. But that's nothing compared with the flu, also called influenza. In the U.S. alone, the flu has caused an estimated 32 million illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations and 18,000 deaths this season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""I would be far more concerned about the Flu, based on CDC data.But as someone has said....we go...meh...about the flu."
"All this is, is another form of the flu.. maybe it has a higher mortality rate. Slightly. Not trying to downplay it. God bless the families who have lost love ones due to this, but it all just sounds like a bad flu. It’s killed quite a lot of people in China, but then again there’s over 1.2 billion people there. And Chinese doctors have mentioned that this whole thing started 4-5 months before it was first reported. So it’s not like 3,000 people dropped dead in a matter of 3-4 weeks either.."
Exactamundo !!!! Bingo !!!!
"Discover12...You’re going to drive yourself crazy with all those what ifs. Sounds like you may be more comfortable staying home. Sucks but ya gotta be okay with whatever decision you make. If you do decide to go, have a great time. (Curious, do you have any long-term effects from NV?)"
"Yeah, another case of the irresponsible media blowing something out of proportion. I'm not saying there isn't a problem, but thus far, it's not even on the level of the annual flu, and yet it's affecting the economy (local and global), and making people paranoid. Chinese restaurants here in Toronto are going out of business. People thinking of canceling trips two weeks from now where there's been one suspected case among millions.Ridiculous.Mark"
"Thanks Becky for your encouraging response, no long term effect from NV. Thanks to all of you who contributed to this forum, it made it very interesting forum. I received enough encouragement from all of you to proceed with this trip. So unless things deteriorates I will be writing again in a few weeks about hopefully my positive experience at my DR vacation. I guess I am more careful after living through many events in my past travel, being in Santiago Chile during their major earth quick, was vacationing in China during the Sar epidemic and was at the RIU, DR during the Newark virus . In the meantime I will be following the news for any development. All the best to all of you."
"discover12 - we are proceeding as well - scheduled for 3/6 thru 3/15. I wish you well and I hope we're both back here reporting great, uneventful trips in a few weeks :)"
We are scheduled to go to PC (Ambar) April 25th. There is no way I am cancelling unless they suddenly decide to stop all flights (which I assume will not happen). :)
"We are up to 20 cases in Ontario, over 30 for the country. ONE isolated case in the whole DR country."
time to close the Ontario border ;-)
Time for me to move to PC ;o)
There are going to be more cases in the DR and most likely anywhere in the world and probably many cases. Follow what your government tells you or WHO and continue to live your life and be cautious but if you are watching for every single case in a country before you travel and you freak out each time you see a case then don't travel. Otherwise live life.
There are 2 reported cases in Punta Cana. 1 from Italy and 1 from France. Both visitors.
Traveller from Italy isn't in PC. Where is the info on the other visitor?
"All the best gosia4, when you have a chance please let us know how the vacation is progressing and hope that you will have a very enjoyable vacation."
mari s<< There are 2 reported cases in Punta Cana. 1 from Italy and 1 from France. Both visitors. >>Link please to article Angie.
"a 56-year-old man from France, is under observation in the hospital and awaiting test results for the virus. ......https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hea…"
"Man from France ""under observation"" and is also in SD not PC. Still only one confirmed case."
"Was just replying to Angie who was looking for a link ... and yes still only one confirmed case ......the original poster was stating both were in Punta Cana .... link clarifies not the case ...both are in Santo Domingo ...https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-dominican/dominican-republic-confirms-first-case-of-coronavirus-idUSKBN20O21VEdited: 1:12 pm, March 03, 2020 "
There are a lot of people who have been tested and the results come back negative over 90% of the time in the US so I would not read to much into testing. Obviously there is the 1 case from the Italian guy who was never in Punta Cana by the way but in Bayahibe who is quarantined at a military hospital.
"hdbjones,Thanks for link but as I suspected not in Punta Cana the other poster did not clarify the area and I was just curious where she got her statement from. Angie."
"First reported case at a hotel in Bayahibe. Sadly, I had just booked airfare and was reviewing hotels when my sister sent me the notice. As there is no CDC warning, I still would have gone, but one in our party is fairly unrational."
"For those who might not be aware of another forum on this subject, first hand information from someone who just arrived to Punta Cana, here is the link:https:/…105851115"
"Just an FYI..A doctor and a nurse from the infirmary at Viva Dominicus,who worked with the first paatient, is being quarantined. How long until the rest of the staff gets sick? : (https:/…"
"Prizfromphilly ""How long until the rest of the staff gets sick? "" The article does not state they are sick. Only quarantined as a precaution. Just like in your country or mine."
""" How long until the rest of the staff gets sick?""So just who is sick ? Talk about fearmongering ..,"
They are being quarantined at the military hospital off the property out of precaution not because they are showing symptoms.Agreed SWNova PrizefromPhilly obviously trying to stir the pot. Just to remind people there are still ZERO coronavirus cases in Punta Cana also this is the wrong forum for this conversation as the 1 guy in the country from Italy who had it was never ever in Punta Cana and traveled to another part of the country.
just got back from breathless in punta cana. no coronavirus chat at all. you'll be fine.
Enough tequila flowing around at Breathless. That stuff will kill any virus.... LOL. I'm still recuperating and have been back a month. :o)
Slyguy23: (I'm still recuperating and have been back a month) Is that from the tequila or was there other issues?
Yes from the tequilla mostly... LOL. No issues whatsoever with serious issues like food or other things.
"<< “ Yes from the tequilla mostly...” >>As my roommate in college used to say...‘“One tequila, two tequila, three tequila... floor!”:-)Edited: 2:46 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"This was in Santo Domingo, not in Punta Cana."
My family a total of 8 of us are going to Punta Cana for the kids March Break from Canada and we are keeping track on the Canadian Travel Advisory website. However our aunt and uncle are also joining us from the UK where the virus has increased in numbers. DR has said on their government website that they are not accepting flights from the 8 affected countries which is a good sign however what do we do if the UK is still okay to arrive in DR and someone is affected with the virus? Is DR screening in the airports?
To the last part of your question... I hope so.
I'm here now...all buffets and alacarts had greeters last week putting hand sanitizer on everyone as they entered
Are you back home Bomby? Hand Sanitizer have been used at restaurants and buffets at most resorts for a few years now. At least resorts I have visited.
Not insisted on to every person coming in..
When at AI resorts in Mexico people invariably want to do tequila shots at various times during the stay. Personally I prefer Sambuca or well many other shots than tequila but I will do 1 if people want. They want to do 2 I draw the line. I have seen too many friends elect to do more and the end up feeling like crap the next day or puking them back up so I draw the line at 1 for tequila at a time LOL.
"Bomb, good to hear.Yes, some resorts do have hand sanitizers stations, however, upon my observation I only see about 1-5% of people using them."
"I know that at Secrets Cap Cana in December, the hostess would not let you in the door at restos or buffet without taking a ""squirt"" of the hand sanitizer.... LOL."
We are scheduled to go to Punta Cana on 3/15 for spring break. Any updates from anywhere there now? Hopefully we can all go and have a great vacation.
"Melissa, a few folks there right now or just returned have commented on various threads and have indicated that there are no issues and very little mention of this at the resorts they visited."
Managers at Palma Real had a big meeting about it...precautions..it doesn't do well in hot places..better to be here than in cold..
"Melissa, there has been 1 Italian tourist who is quarantined at a military hospital. He was never in Punta Cana and didn't fly into the airport in Punta Cana but traveled to another area of the DR. They also tested a French tourist but his test came back negative for the coronavirus. They have also tested all of the Italian man's family who traveled with him and they also have come back negative for the virus as well. Here is the link.https:/…"
SlyGuy23 They have been also doing the squirt in the hand at the Bahia resorts for a few years. Most restaurants are very aggressive to make sure you take your squirt.
"CT, yes I remember our trip to Ambar about 6 years ago and the young lady at the buffet was very ""persuasive"" with her hand sanitizer thingy...LOL."
"I am here at the Corner Bar now. As for being proactive, the bar is wiped down with Lysol every 30 minutes regardless of if anyone is there. The same is happening for all surfaces people may touch...door handles, sink faucets, toilet handles...etc.The girls are instructed to wash their hands every 30 minutes.Also, it looks like patrons are discouraged from giving the staff a kiss...a common gesture in the islands. So, yes, even small operations are taking this seriously."
TY Mike for sharing proactive info. I can't wait to read what resorts are doing and shuttle/transfers are doing to protect the traveler and the staff of both. (other than the Sanitizer Spritz I get at my resort on any given day-although grateful to read that info) The Corner Bar is lucky to get those Lysol Wipes. They are difficult to find in my area and online.
I'm going to Punta Cana and I'm not worried. We have more people infected here in Quebéc then Punta Cana. I ordered some special masks and plan on wearing my latex gloves. I'm bringing lysol wipes for the things I will touch without my gloves.As long as you take precautions you will be safe. Plus the virus does in the heat.
"Youlanda: Agree probably it is safer in DR than in Canada. Hope you have a wonderful vacation please keep us up-to-date on your vacation, we are planning to go there in couple of weeks unless DR start having new case."
"Actually Prize...not the wipes...the spray. I observed it first hand. Also, bathroom check logs posted. I was with 2 tourist who commented...cleaner bathrooms than back home! I guess a compliment to the bar. I can only speak for one transfer company that will be unmentioned, but the procedure is spray down all hard surfaces where hands come into contact with Lysol spray in advance of any pick-up."
"Ughhh, add this one to the list...https:/…"
"I am currently staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana. Everything is fine , there is no news regarding corona virus or anyone being infected here."
Mary B...what are you relying on for your news source?
https://dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2020/03/…

"Deb...So sad.Mike...That's great info about the bar and the shuttle service that shall be nameless. You can be sure I want the same info from our transfer company. If not to my satisfaction, I will find one that does. I love reading useful proactive info, rather than info that ignores that it will come to PC, because, it most likely will. It is just a matter of time.SW Nova...At least call me out. I don't flag posts. I have no issue with the person in question posting info that does not directly affect his bottomline. I am happy to read proactive or actual on the ground info, His post re the Corner Bar actually shared helpful proactive info that did not directly affect his bottom line. He has also posted he doesn't like Hospiten hospital. Great info. I think someone needs to wipe off their lipstick. ; )I would love to know how many test kits the Ministry of Health has for its citizens and it's tourists. I know my own country is a disgrace in this department."
"Oh now little Prize.., I never mentioned any ones name, yet you somehow seem to self identify with that person who would call another poster out for no good reason other than they that come on here to state the way things really are in PC . Then that same poster cries out .. "" OH you can't do that ! You can't truthfully say what is going on in PC because you run a business there, you are so biased ! ""Says a lot about you, doesn't it."" I know my own country is a disgrace. "" Can't argue with that..,Edited: 11:31 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"@zeeka, yes, it is mandatory to inform the Ministry of Public Health."
Really looking forward to our 21 night trip in a few weeks time as we now have 116 confirmed cases here in the UK
People saying i will keep updating you when we ll there but nobody is updating us .what is going there in Punta Cana. Can someone post??
Likely because there is nothing to update from PC as nothing happening there.
Because they are having to much fun on their vacations to spend time posting here.
Can't post if there is nothing to tell
"We arrived here 3/3 . Leaving 3/10. At Hardrock. Traveling with my husband. I have not heard anyone talking about the virus. No one has brought it up to me. I am seeing and smelling disinfectant in public areas, seeing staff cleaning. I am trying to be careful of all surfaces I touch, but nearly impossible in a resort setting. I am searching the internet a couple of times per day and watching the news for any new developments. Am checking here as well. Got to say that everyone here is having a good time and there appears to be a definite lack of concern."
"EnzoX2: Thanks for posting the updates. Great news, Glad to hear that you are having good time. please keep us up to date with any new development. So far so good, Enjoy the rest of your vacation."

"Your travels are surely memorable. Thankfully you are well. Our Gal group is flying from TO to Punta Cana one week from now for March Break. Be aware the airline can change your flight date, time & carrier airline at any time. That happened to us last year. If my travel partner had not noticed we would have missed our flight. We were changed from China Airlines to Air Canada at an earlier flight time. Personally I’m concerned about dengue because there were 14,000 cases in DR last year - 2019. I’ve lots of insect wipes with DEET."
No one has bitten me yet! Lol totally comfortable here right now. 82 deg and slightly cloudy. We will call it heaven.
"Never had that problem post #158 after 16 visits but then I drink alcohol which kills the mosquitos . Please show use the 14,000 cases with proof."

"Hi, any panic over in PC that youve noticed?"
"Brenda, great question !!!! It acutally pertains to Punta Cana :-)"
Hola! We return on March 8 and there were no issues at our resort (Barcelo Bavaro Beach Adults side) or airport. Staff had hand sanitizing pumps at buffets and people were more diligent about washing hands.
Thank you!
"Thank you, good not know they have hand sanitizing stations at buffet.Edited: 2:52 pm, March 10, 2020 "
I saw this from club med. They seem to be taking it seriously.https:/…coronavirus-measure
"Hand sanitiser in the buffet has been a regular sight every time we've been to the DR over the last few years. In Cayo Levantado one of the wait staff stood in the door with the pump dispenser so you had no choice but to use it, think people are just noticing it more."
"Hi, Where were they flying from? We are due to go 23rd April and worrying we are going to get cancelled. we will be devastated"
Crazyemmg: I cancelled mine because I would be devastated if I go there and be quarantined in a military base in DR. If they cancel it is for a reason. If they have cancelled mine I would have got all my money back from them or the insurance company. All I can say I hope that you will be able to go there and have a wonderful vacation. I haven't heard of anyone that went and got the virus except perhaps a couple in Bayahipe in DR.

Who is in Dominican Republic right now? How is everything there? I m going there in couple of days im so stressed (
The more people who get hysterical and decide not to go is great news for those of us are going. Shorter lines at the airport and less crowded resorts. Totally a win-win!
I just read there are 5 reported cases in the Dominican Republic- all travel related. Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer said for people over the age of 65 not to travel outside of Canada. But it didn’t come from Canada’s Chief Medical Officer- I don’t know if we should bring our parents they are 69 and healthy. Thoughts anyone?
"MG3: There is always another time where you and your parents will feel comfortable. In particular if you can get your money back, or if you can negotiate with the hotel and airline to postpone the trip. Although the news sound good from all the Caribbean, I personally decided to cancel and loose the money. So that depends on your level of comfort."
Dina...I am here...all aware ( at least those I talk to) but just another day in the tropics.
Are people wearing masks at the airport and resorts?
"Junto a mi familia viajaremos a Punta Cana por 10 dias a partir del 05 Abril 2020 y estamos pensando en, o suspender el viaje, o postergar el viaje a uno de los Resort Palladium.Favor sus comentarios para ayudarnos a tomar una decisión definitiva."
"In my daily travels in and out of resorts and around the region, seeing someone with a mask is very rare."
If you booked through Air Canada Vacation you can now change your booking date
Glad to hear AC Vacations is doing this. We are scheduled to leave via AC Vacations on April 25th. We are still planning to go but will reschedule if needed (they are saying you can re-book up to 3 days before).
My wife and I are headed to PC on the 19th of this month. Traveling from Michigan where there is now 2 confirmed cases. Getting a bit nervous about traveling - worst part would be stuck on a DR military base for 14+ days. We are still weighing our options though.
https:/…
Thanks for the info but isn't this from March 2nd? I could be wrong. It doesn't actually say when that was updated.
"Hola Estamos en la misma situación,Pero dicen que no devuelven pasajes o cambian fechas.Nos complica el viaje en el avión donde toda la gente va en un mismo espacio...también tenemos fecha para el 5 de abril con reservas en el Iberoestar.Alguna sugerencia??"
"I am beyond appreciative of everyone’s posts on this thread and have been following the past 2 weeks so THANK YOU! Sadly though, we just cancelled this morning for our trip scheduled this Saturday 3/14-3/21 since there is no guarantee to make it back home to the states. Our travel agency was great about the whole thing. Neither of us were concerned with catching the dreaded virus (heck, I don’t even want to catch a cold!) but the unknown of border closings is just not a gamble I’m willing to take."
This is my fear also - what is the likelihood of not being allowed back into the country? I do not want to be stranded
Thanks for this. We're scheduled on the 17th of April. Booked hotel separately. Flying on Aeroplan points. Aeroplan is now also allowing re-booking with no penalty. We'll make a decision closer to the time...I will be so upset if we don't end up going. We love PC!
"Seems like since the WHO declared the virus Pandemic, all airlines are now waiving change fees. Some allow flights/bookings to be changed until the end of 2020 which provides lots of flexibility should you still wish to travel once this thing is under control."
"Me2, I'm supposed to.leave this Sat and return the 22nd. We are very concerned"
@ Matt B Agreed!...and precisely why we’ve made the difficult decision to cancel/postpone. We would have worried the entire trip and ruined it for ourselves anyway. The DR news don’t appear very forthcoming with reported cases and are not putting anything out to inform about what precautionary measures are being taken at the resorts or in the country so the possibility of more positive cases in the area and being closed off from US borders makes it feel risky.
"I have to question our airlines allowing people to postpone... does that mean they hold onto your money and you have to book later on... but at a much higher price?They have to make up their losses somewhere.Edited: 2:52 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Where are you from originally? Do you know of any airports being shut down due to the virus ?
This is my only concern really!!
if not part of a group. Group can't if travel date is less than 21 days.
That's my only concern at the moment aris
We are leaving next Wednesday to 18th for PC and are ready to go! Not letting this stop us. Just using basic sanitary precautions. Taking some extra sanitizer with us. Going to a brand new resort so not overly concerned. I do not believe we will have any issues coming back into the states.
We leave on 3/23 from Chicago for one week. We are staying at the Nickelodeon Resort. I called the concierge this morning. Sounds like there has been 5 cases all in Santa Domingo. None in Punta Cana and none at the Nickelodeon resort. So confused on what to do. Booked with CheapCaribbean and they won't let me cancel or rebook so I would lose all my money.
"To all of those who are worried about their vacation. Except for one returning vacationer to Canada, we haven't heard from anyone who is there now or came recently that ran into any problem. My brother who is in Jamaica right now , reporting that he is enjoying his vacation very much, resort is less crowded, but that make the situation more manageable and enjoyable. On the other hand, I was booked to go to DR shortly and cancelled my vacation, Air Canada refused to let me reschedule so I lost my ticket except about $ 150 tax. So everyone has his own comfort level but it seems that the risk is very low to get into trouble if you travel now, hopefully no change in the situation."
"Discouver12So why did AC not let you reschedule your trip if all the Canadian airlines said they would allow it?Edited: 5:23 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"From Dominican Today news:Santo Domingo.- Despite that several countries have closed their borders and restricted the arrival of people from China, Italy and other nations as a preventive measure against COVID-19, the Dominican Republic still allows the entry of passengers arriving from those countries through several airlines.This is confirmed by a statement from JetBlue airline, in which its customers are informed that all those who have been in China in the last 14 days will only be able to travel to Punta Cana (PUJ) and Santo Domingo (SDQ), and no another destination in the Dominican Republic.So far the Dominican Republic has restricted flights from Italy, however there are passengers who have entered the country, with connections to other terminals such as Spain.JetBlue has told its customers of the measures they have taken against the new coronavirus and of the restrictions that exist in the destinations in their itineraries."
"Carl H: Because the ticket was booked June last year, I can only reschedule it if I pay $ 400 penalty travel between now and June this year and pay the difference in fares.After failing several trials during the daytime to reach Air Canada, I got up at 4:30 AM and waited on the phone for an hour and half to reach someone. I am sure that everyone has experienced how terrible Air Canada service have been recently. You can book online, but once they have your money good luck trying to do any changes."
"hdbjohnes: Thanks for the information. This is a very poor decision from the government, cannot imagine the problem, that one person with the virus in any of these resorts, may create risking the safety of vacationers health and their enjoyments"
Hbdjones. As does Canada
"Dina, we decided to go on our trip. We have 2 kids. We are currently at the Hard Rock Hotel in PC. Our plane was full coming into PC. No one was wearing mask at MSP airport, on the plane, at PUJ airport, nor at Hard Rock. The resort is very clean, hand sanitizer stations at check-in counters, buffets, restaurants, and bars. People are enjoying the time here. I do wish that everyone will stay healthy and happy whether they choose to go or cancel/postpone their trips.ps; I bring with us lots of hand sanitizer and wipes, to wipe the seats on the plane, and to use at the resort. Please bring bug spray and sunscreen too :)"

Hi glad you enjoying your trip. Travelling from the UK to Puna Cana on Sunday. Can you please tell me what measures there were at airport to check incoming passengers if they had symptoms of COVID 19. Are they testing or checking temperatures
Currently they are doing nothing but normal procedures.
Im glad to hear you enjoying vacation with your family. We leaving on 3/16 and still didn’t decide what to do its very scary to get stock
My flight came to PC from the US. There were no measures such as health screenings or temperature scanning. The lines at the immigration moved fairly quick. The officer did ask if we had been to China and Italy in the last 2 weeks. Im not sure if there would be different procedures for planes coming from other countries. I wish you a safe flight and Im sure you will enjoy the time here in PC. It is very sunny and warm here today. Everyone at Hard Rock Hotel that I see is well and happy.
Barrie how can you confirm that? Is there anyone in PC that has gone thru airport that can confirm on here please?
Baba’s thank you for that updated info. Can’t believe they not screening at airport. Big decisions to make before Sunday. What made you choose to still go to PC from USA ?
"When Canada is advising its citizen to avoid all international travel, I believe it is prudent to follow their advice. I am not smarter than health officials. Another season will come when we can travel without worrying about all what ifs. Too bad they don't come with a ban on outside travel so insurance companies don't have any excuse to not cover trip cancellation policies.Edited: 2:23 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"I was booked to go to Dreams Punta Cana on March 22, for my nephew's wedding. It looks like they're calling the trip off. It was booked with Air Transat. Trips can be changed up until 24 hours before the flight, and re-booked (including destination and hotel) for any time up until October 31, 2020.My friend was taking his family to Grand Cayman this Sunday. He's cancelling. He's been trying to get through to Sunwing, but no luck yet. He says their policy is 5 days before flight, so he might be out of luck.Mark"
Hi is still the situation in Punta Cana save? I should gl there next Thursday but I worried a little bit. I don ´t want to be stuck there for long time because of coronavirus. Thank you! And enjoy the vacation!
I’m in the same boat :( what are you leaning towards?
The 2 confirmed came from Italy and France. Go on your vacation and take the necessary precautions. Enjoy
Why are you saying being stuck on military bases? Is that what is happening?

My cousin is there she wore a mask and gloves on the plain and is having a great time.
"Dave, with what's going on right now, choosing to go on the trips or to stay home is a personal preference . It also depends on the updated information from the WHO, CDC, the mainstream reports from the DR, which I have been watching those very closely before I decided to go. I booked my trip back in Nov, 2019, with cancel for any reason. We are in the early 40s and our 2 kids are in elementary and middle school. We are all healthy individuals.I took with us lots of hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes. I teach my family to be diligent in hand hygiene. We love the atmosphere and the people here in PC and we are glad that we are here now. We feel very safe here at the resort. The beach is beautiful, lots of spaces for people to enjoy. Keep up with hand hygiene is my golden rule. My State back home has more cases than the DR (in Santo Domingo, no case yet in PC as far as I am aware). Dave, whatever decision you would make, I wish you and your family be healthy and safe."

"As of this morning there are 11 cases total confirmed, 119 being monitored at home, 18 being monitored in the hospital. I’d be worried all week!...who’s preparing the food? Who’s sitting at the table next to me? Who was in this lounge chair before me? Who caught it down here and is flying back home with me? Those are things I have no control over regardless of how much I wash my hands or refrain from touching my face. We’re both in our early 40’s and healthy so, yes, we’d probably both recover fine but the others we could infect that may not survive are what separate the socially conscious from the selfish."

"Baba Thanks for update. Yes agree it’s up to your own attitude to risk. My stance is me & my family got more chance of catching virus in UK than DM. There is no screening upon entry into UK and we have over 1000 positive cases or the USA so why would DM with 5 cases. My stance is we go, take precautions, good hygiene hand wash etc and enjoy our holiday. Has anyone in Puma Can been told what quarantine measures are if anyone catches virus whilst in your hotel? Please post some answers if possible by 3/16I just hope there is no lockdown when we return on 3/26. This is my biggest worry"
"The sad thing is that the biggest concern with travelling to PC isn't necessarily the fear of the virus but more the ever changing rules being imposed by various countries on re-entry. And yes being in a plane with 200 or so folks I know nothing about for numerous hours is an added ""bonus""."
"Yeah, it wasn't specifically Punta Cana that was the issue for us - it was travelling anywhere. The possibility of being stranded, quarantined, etc. doesn't appeal to me.Mark"
Exactly Mark. And we can't even find toilet paper anywhere in my part of town right now... talk about panic. Thinking about leaving the country suddenly doesn't seem like a great idea to me.
"I wish people would read more then just the headlines of news articles and use reliable sources. Below are two articles from the CDC and US Embassy for those traveling from the states. Note, there are no restrictions from US citizens being able to come back into the country, even from Level 3 areas (China, Italy, etc). Again, read more than just the headlines.

We're scheduled to fly out of Utah on the 26th and in the same boat. I think we've decided unless they cancel our trip we're going. My biggest concern is exactly the same as you stated.
"Glad you see it this way Pioneer. Thing is we are reading everything and for us in Canada, rules and restrictions are changing every hour. Latest one to come is that some airports will be closed to out of country flights. This means some will not be returning home directly. Bit of an ""inconvenience "" I would say. Add potential of imposed quarantine, loss of salary etc... just a few things to consider. If none of those things apply to you then yes, enjoy your trip. For others (who have read the latest rules) it might not be so simple."
Yes - changing as we currently speak.
"Hi, I was there for 3 weeks until the 2end of March. It was no problem at all, fantastic weather and all was good. No any talk nor any cases regarding the Coronovirus. However the emigration officials do wear the mask at the airport."
"Conditions are changing rapidly, so what still seems OK today may not feel like a good idea, or may not even be an option, tomorrow. Our Canadian government is already advising against all international travel and, as stated, advises all returning travelers to self isolate. Glad we bumped our trip up a little earlier this year and returned from PC Feb 21. I find the following site more current and more detailed than the Johns Hopkins site for tracking the global situation. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
Yes. Stay home

"beboy, this is an english site, no clue what you just said"
"Beboy said there was only one Italian case and died of Dengue fever. Not just old news but also misinformation. Obviously beboy is not even reading the posts here, or perhaps that what DR news media saying in Spanish not to raise alarm."

Can anyone give a honest up to date clarification on what is happening in DR at the moment and in particular Punta Cana.

#Update. Just been informed at 10.30am GMT today UK time by my travel company that my holiday to DR has been cancelled due to new travel restrictions announced by DR authorities. We were due to depart UK tomorrow. Any UK posts on here check your travel agent. For my USA and Canadian friends I hope you all get some clear updates from your Government. This announcement may have an impact on you all if this has been a Dominican decision. I wish you all well and hope this info helps.
Hi Dave.Sorry to hear that. Can I please ask which tour operator you were travelling with. We are due to leave on 2/4 not on a package but flights through British Airways. Thanks
Hi Calagan it was TUI
I was scheduled for a trip to Punta Cana on a direct flight from Nova Scotia 3-14 Mar. Developed symptoms on 9-10 Mar but thought was likely a cold. On 10 Mar made a planned move from resort to condo. As my cough was quite bad and I was concerned about flying I tried to contact airline on 12 Mar to no avail. Then contacted Canadian Embassy who notified Dominican authorities. I am waiting for them to come to take swabs. The test then has to go to Santo Domingo. There is a queue and then 36hr for result so earliest I can leave I think will be 19 Mar. I am isolating in the condo and Dominican authorities and my airbnb host have been very supportive. As I arrived well before any blanket travel advisories my insurance is covering. But if you come now I'm not sure if that remains the case. Luckily the condo was available for an extended stay.
Callan- just posted on another thread that BA have just cancelled our holiday. We were due to fly on 21st March.
"For anyone flying from UK/EuropeThe Dominican Government reported last night (Saturday 14th) that it suspended flights to and from Europe, South Korea and China, starting at 6:00 am on Monday and for a month, due to the expansion of the coronavirus.Angie."
We are going april 8th from uk and definitely not thinking of cancelling. To stop us will on be if we're told we can't go.

Hard Rock had one confirmed case of Codvid
Hey /Fernando not valid without a link ;-)
"<< ""Hard Rock had one confirmed case"" >>Links... or it didn't happen.:-)Edited: 7:30 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Not true, Im at Hard Rock right now. Things are as normal as can be."
Hola Jorge! Pudieron resolver el tema? Yo estoy en la misma pero viajo o viajaba el 2 de abril desde BsAs
"We are at Barcelo Bavaro Beach. There is nothing out of the ordinary here... which is disturbing! We watched a dance contest between 5 men , all from different countries. They hugged continuously, they shook hands, they kissed the hostess. A squirt of hand sanitizer when you walk in a restaurant is not going to stop the virus. Being informed might! Watched a worker rub her nose, then hand me a drink. No evidence of a lot of illness but occasionally Visitors are coughing and sneezing into their hands. We are distancing ourselves socially as much as is possible in this situation. If we can, sitting far from others, not striking up conversations etc. Why am I here you ask? The major warnings From Canada came less than 24 hours from departure. We tried to call and get guidance but could not get through to anyone. Ultimately we are and I think theses resorts do not have a clue what’s coming"
alguna informacion en aeroporto de bogota ? Las fechas estan de acuerdo ? alguna informacion de cerrar los aeroportos ?
"Vly, no need to feel guilty, the info coming from our PM has been confusing last week... plus if the airlines are still flying there and telling people everything's okay then many other people also went. Try to enjoy the best you can and keep informed of return flights."
Thanks for the reassuring words @debinatore❣️
"Anyone who is still debating to go or not, please watch this alarming simulation of how Corona virus spread.Be safe.https:/…"
""" Ultimately we are and I think theses resorts do not have a clue what’s coming""If you look at North America, I would say the same thing...thus the reason for the total shutdown of bars and restaurants in some places. The warning meant nothing."
"Inacio: I decided earlier on to cancel my vacation, nowhere in the world is safe. The governments of the world advising that unless it is absolutely essential you should stay put. Watch the simulation link I posted few minutes ago to understand the severity of the situation. All the best."
Mike: It is time for resorts to take short term pain for long term gain. The later they act the worst it is going to get. Just like the situation in north america now. They were too slow to react and now they are facing unprecedented shutdown.
"Thanks discover for your prompt answer... here in Brazil, there is no kind of closed airports or flights, there is only a low demand at flights and few flights got scheduled... today one of the biggest flight company released a video showing that any airport got the order to close... me and a group of friends got a trip to Punta Cana and looking for to do... we might flight tonight and little scaried about the return flight at 03-24Edited: 8:55 am, March 16, 2020 "
Stay home as when you get home you have to self quarantine for 14 days
"<< ""Stay home as when you get home you have to self quarantine for 14 days"" >>And if you DO stay home... self-quarantining for 14 days anyway is still a good idea.(Looking more and more like we're heading in that direction anyway, no?)"
Thanks I did read something else about 10 mins after I wrote this. So yes I know I'm not going. Hope others have better luck at later dates.
"Fernando, can you provide evidence of this?"
"Te aconsejo que canceles el viaje o mejor dicho muevas la fecha para mas adelante,es un riesgo viajar en avion e ir a otro pais que no es eua y contraer ese virus ,to tenia pasaje y hotel en puntacana para la primera semana de abril y cancele todo salud es mas importante"
Thanks for the post. We leave for PC on the 28th and trying to figure out what to do. Things are changing daily but think it is worse being here b/c of the amount of cases vs pretty much no cases in PC.
"Duke, you could be a carrier and have no symptoms yet. The advice not to travel isn't just for you, it is for others as well. You don't want to risk contaminating others-especially in a country where health and unemployment systems aren't like ours.  Let's stop the propagation. That's what these travel bans are about."
Dominican Republic to adopt more anti-crisis measures.Will await the see what president Danilo Medina has to say.https:/…Angie.
"Just so you are aware, the virus has hit the D.R. Hearing from ""boots on the ground"" ... grocery stores are opening early for the elderly to shop, supplies are limited for a few days now, depending on the area and the store, people that can are stocking up, many people laid off, no pay, excursions cancelled due to lack of guests, resorts closing or combining.... etc."
"Well said Daisy, thanks Angie for the link, I hope Duke you read that link and take the advice of Daisy. At this time we have to be considerate of these struggling islands with much less resources and means to withstand this crises. There will be always a time where we can take a vacation and not being worried what will happen. All the best Duke."
"I’m getting more sick of the know-Alls on this site treating people like children. It’s stressful enough dealing with this without talking down to people.. say it once, then shut up.. sorry... it’s been eating at me"
"We are quickly entering the tough times.No paper of any sort, no rice at all, no pasta. Lots of very expensive steaks available. Yes, major chains and banks cutting way back on hours and restricting those who enter.Yesterday, the main road from La Romana to Punta Cana was blocked by protesters in regard to the lack of healthcare, being released from hotel jobs without any remuneration and generally being hung out to dry. Expect more of this as the days pass and closer to Punta Cana. Meanwhile, inside the resort walls, Biff and Muffy are having the time of their lives!"
"Well Mike, Biff and Muffy may not get a flight home."
"Mike, I was told a different story about the blockade... since things are effed up anyway I will say it here... I was told the blockade was in protest to the gov't/health setting up a quarantine ""camp"" close to where a lot of haitians live and they don't want it so close to them."
"I have heard some resorts are closing for a period of time ....because people aren't traveling for fear of the virus, but not anything about the virus there."
"@304: it's because some people are behaving like children. When governments are asking people to avoid unnecessary travel so as to try to curtail the propagation of the disease to other people, when they are shutting everything down, when people are losing their jobs, their savings, getting sick, yes I think people can criticize those that don’t listen. The sooner people will listen, the sooner this will be over. If they don’t then, the disease will keep spreading and more stringent measures with penalties like those announced by France yesterday will be adopted."
"Wahoowa: you have the choice of not reading the post or turning off your computer. No need to shout at those of us who are just trying to help. I was in the same situation two weeks ago, the feedback from kind people who posted their opinion helped me making my decision. Thanks to all who are taking the time to advise others. Please don't be ofended with Wahoowa remarks."
"I'm not offended, and, some of us were of the same mindframe at some point. Some countries, leaders, fan pages made out that there was nothing wrong and business as usual. If people were told the truth in the beginning or our so-called leaders acted / reacted earlier we wouldn't be in this predicament.Now, it's a differen story,it IS upon us and we must do what we can...damkeyboard isacting up LOL"
"Of course some will not listen until it is too late. And of course, we can criticize decisions made by Government or Leadership cause we know better... well at least we voted so that gives us the right to criticize right? In the end, this thing is here and it will be a while until things are back to normal. For those of us who love to travel, this is simply a set back in our vacation planning. The true victims are folks who make a living at hosting us. Virus or no virus, they will be feeling the impact of this for a while."
If I offended.. I’m not sorry. There is a way to talk to people and a way not to. Advice on this forum is phenomenal! Talking to people like idiots is not! Compassion people. Some aren’t as seasoned as others. We’ve been to PC 14 times.. doesn’t mean I need to talk down to people. Ok.. I’ve said all I need to say.
"I was scheduled to be in PC on the 18th of April. Brazilian airline GOL has just suspended all international flights. So I guess I won't be heading to PC anytime soon. Well, too bad! Luckly I got all my money back and no problems cancelling The Level at Melia either. I guess it's a good idea for us all to stay home for the upcoming months! Be safe! Wash your hands!"
"Charles, had you booked The Level at Melia directly or through a third party? We are booked to be there May 5-13 and feel we will be postponing this trip to a later date as I doubt think the dust will settle in time to consider going. This is the first time we booked directly through Melia, but I don’t see any notices on their website regarding the Coronavirus. We still have time, but I hope we won’t have a problem postponing. A voucher would be fine as we would use it after everything clears."
"Calll the Melia and they will change your reservation, I did."
"Anyone from the U.K. has anyone checked the FCO advisory? I spotted the advisory about DR and nationals from Europe and including the U.K., will NOT be permitted entry. Please people be smart and check advisories. @SharonPGood luck trying to go in April, your best hold off, Coz the situation is changing rapidly. I work in travel, so I know this first hand"
"I just returned from Punta Cana, until yesterday no restriction, no people wearing masks on the resorts, no cancellation of excursions, normal life... But this situation was yesterday, things are changing too fast, and we could notice at the airport flight cancelations, people looking for anticipate their flights, I don’t know until when the normal life will remains!"
"For anyone that comes across this thread here is the latest update the DR is closing their borders air, land, sea at 6:00 AM Thursday March 19th. President Danilo Medina announced. Only repatriation flights allowed to get foreign citizens returned to their country of origin.https:/…Angie."
"If you're still at the resort... We're all pretty good at throwing some money around during our vacation holidays, but these are the times when families on the island really need some help with all the resort closures. If you are able to please consider reaching into your pockets a little more often, these people are really going to need some cash to buy food and necessities."
I heard they maybe shutting the borders down tomorrow I’m not positive I just saw it
PassportCorrect see my post #320.Angie.
"Yo como Dominicano que soy y profesional hotelero, debo mirar los interese de los clientes. Mi consejo es que nos visites después del verano para que no se lleve sorpresa. Ya estarán todas las cosas calmadas con Dios por delante y sus vacaciones serán placenteras."
Capcansports: Thank you for your kind word. Dominican Republic is my favorite country for winter vacation. My wife and I have been their over 30 times. I hope there will be a turn around soon. We already booked our next winter vacation to your beautiful country. All the best.Gracias por tu amable palabra. República Dominicana es mi país favorito para las vacaciones de invierno. Mi esposa y yo hemos estado allí más de 30 veces. Espero que haya un cambio pronto. Ya reservamos nuestras próximas vacaciones de invierno en tu hermoso país. Todo lo mejor.
"Just read this today, While some companies are taking advantage of the situation, that is what Sunwing is doing:Sunwing is offering available seats on its repatriation flights from southern destinations to stranded Canadians, free of charge – including for non-Sunwing customers, the company announced on Thursday (March 19th) “We understand a lot of Canadians are still stranded outside the country and struggling to get home,” said Stephen Hunter, CEO of Sunwing Travel Group. “That’s why we want to open up any extra capacity we have. It’s the Canadian thing to do.”"
thank you for your message capcanasports
