"Hello!I'm planning to travel via Croatia as part of a longer train journey from London to Athens, and I'd like to take the Slovenia-Zagreb-Belgrade night train. I can buy tickets on bahn.de as far as Dobova, the last station in Slovenia at the Croatian border, but need to find a way to buy tickets for the Dobova-Zagreb and Zagreb-Belgrade legs online, at a stop or on the train!Does anyone know how I can go about this? Any information on whether couchettes usually run on this service would also be appreciated (I'm currently planning on just making myself comfortable in a seat!)"
"You can also see this train plus the Beograd - Thessaloniki(actually Gevgelija) train in the Serbian Railways timetable. It's easier to download then the Croatian, becuse you can choose to select only the international timetable.Choose the last one on the bottom of the page saying: Међународни саобраћај https://www.srbvoz.rs/red-voznje-kurir/Vagonweb also shows it: https://www.vagonweb.cz/razeni/vlak.php…The remark by the couchette says in German ""Verkehrstage unbekannt"" = days of operation(of the couchette only, not the whole train!) not known.You can buy the Ljubljana - Beograd ticket in Ljubljana, the Sloveninan Railways site even shows the ticket prices:https://potniski.sz.si/srbija/Edited: 9:39 am, June 18, 2020 "
