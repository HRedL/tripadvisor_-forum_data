"Hi will be traveling to albufeira next week , is there any confirmed cases of the corona virus there yet ?"
From what i hear you are more likely to bring it with you than catch it as of this moment as i understand there are no confirmed cases in the Algarve
We have plenty of toilet roll too. 2 cases reported in Porto. #nopanichere and please God let it stay that way.
"No, no confirmed cases. But also no tested possibilities. (No hospitals....) Don't worry, we all have to die sometime! And Portugal is a great place to do so!"
"If you want to know the official numbers in Portugal there are several international sites and the portuguese official daily report, we have imported cases from Italy and Spain and those have infected some friends and relatives (till now) https://www.dgs.pt/em-destaque/relatorio-de-…"
Cancel your trip if you are afraid. You will lose your money. Life goes on as normal here.21 confirmed cases in a population of 10 million. Hardly an epidemic.
"We all stand the chance of getting it.Follow the official guide lines Don,t join the panic buying morons.Life has to go on.Where would you rather be ?"
We have just returned last night from alberferiaWe did not see any cases of corovirus people were just getting on with there holidays as normal
"You won,t see any signs in the UK , apart from the idiots panic buying.Life is going on as normal."
"Very sad for those that do perish from this virus, but despite exaggerated coverage from our media, it would seem that more people have been murdered in the USA alone than are likely to die 100% from this mild virus. (other ailments seem to be affecting most of those that have passed) I`m pretty sure that once another Royal Baby is announced, it gets a bit windy, or a politician missteps this illness will be put on the back burner."
"As I posted before an average two people die each day in UK after falling down stairs.Apart from in the 'hot spots' the infection rate is almost infinitesimally tiny.Yes it is nasty for some who get it and yes some die, but people die every winter from influenza type viruses.People who are that worried have no alternative but to stay indoors and avoid all human contact until it passes.Meanwhile it is a nice sunny day here in Albufeira. The temperature is around 21º, the marina is busy and people are queuing for boat trips.Edited: 9:14 am, March 08, 2020 "
Just watching Portuguese news Channel (in a bar of course) 1 confirmed case in algarve. Don't panic. Don't panic.....please.
"I will be coming next week, not interested in figures or media scaremongering, life goes on, some will get it, some wont. 25yrs ago Aids was going to kill us all. then Sars, then Swine flu, then Nuclear war, every day its a battle to stay alive, why worry."
"1 confirmed case in algarve- Portimão, a teenager that went to Italy with her parents, another Italy imported case. She's now in Lisbon at the pediatric hospital."
And a case of Sagres.
"You cant take it lightly either! I am supposed to go to Porto in May and I will have a better idea whether to go or not a week or two before I am to leave. Iberia is allowing passengers to reschedule if you are to travel before April 30th but I wouldn't be leaving for a few weeks after that. So I just have to wait and see. And yes, I am taking Iberia to Porto. I am sorry to hear that there are two people who contracted the virus."
"Obviously people will need to look at Gov.uk websites if travelling from UK or other info/updates if travelling within Portugal or other countries for further updates if its safe to travel. Sad situation really, but that's life."
I've ordered extra of the essential prescription medication for me & hubby for if we do make it over there and then get ill or quarantined and end up staying longer( Especially with hubbys heart failure).Hoping the situation everywhere improves by the time we are due to fly out in 12 weeks time . Been looking forwards to our return visit so much.

ptnov...I think it's.......'and a case of Sagres (beer)' In response to # 14 re pasta etc.
"I was wondering how long it would be before somebody brought up Corona virus as a topic. Asking on a travel forum if there are any confirmed cases, so looking for a yes/no answer I assume. Would you then base your decisionto travel or not on this answer ?"
The case reported last night was a 16 year old girl from portimao who had been in Italy. She is now being treated in Lisbon.
"There are currently 31 reported cases. I returned to the UK from Cabanas, two weeks ago, I return to the Algarve next week and have two other planned trips in the coming months. Would I alter my plans? Not unless the official authorities of either country, asked me to. Life's a gamble, I'm not going to waste it, worrying.Edited: 7:22 am, March 09, 2020 "
31 in Portugal the UK heading towards 300.The only advice I will follow regarding travel or leisure activities is that from the appointed medical experts ..
"Hundreds of thousands die each year from the flu. If the News media where not blowing this out of all proportion, 99.9% of the population would not be aware of this very Minor event. Go enjoy your holiday and make good memories with your loved ones."
Cancellations of existing bookings up to 60%.Collapse in bookings for the summer.If we are to believe the Portugal News the Algarve is being hit badly by the side effects of the Corona virus.Maybe we should not be too surprised but certainly a massive over reaction.
"The national newspapers via the Algarve Hotel Association say ""At the end of last week, “more than 60% of hotels have reservations for the next three months canceled. The reports that arrive through international travel operators, say that people are ""more concerned with the eventual contamination in air transport and at airports"" than eventual local contamination"". Summer sales are not being massively canceled, the sales had ""a strong braking"" so the perspective is not good."
Lot of chat about this on an Albufeira facebook group and not one mention of anyone cancelling. The AHA are a body not really in touch with reality - just look at how many complaints are directed against their old and need of modernising hotels and yet nothing gets done. They are about as useful as the tourist board who can't even supply bus timetables etc. I hope people see sense and don't over react.
we just got back from albuferia and our hotel was pretty full nobody seemed to be bothered everyone enjoying there time away
"The time to worry is when governments start banning travel and public gatherings like in Italy, or introduce compulsory quarantine on arrival as Israel has just done.If that comes to pass, losing your holiday will be the least of your worries.I am due to fly to UK in a month. If UK Govt. says I cannot, then I cannot. Equally if Portugal bans flights from UK, they it's out of your hands.Edited: 3:53 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"The next phase of UK government action as per its senior medical officer would be for anyone with a temperature or a cold or any respiratory symptoms to self isolate.Not to go to work, not to travel.This could be announced in 10 days or so.Tourism globally is going to take a serious hit.is already seriously affected.The Algarve will be no exception.Cancellations are being reported and there is no problem finding any form of accommodation even in high season.Remember Brits are not the only tourists ..What we all hope for is that any disruption is limited to a few weeks not for the summer."
"I've booked to come over in four weeks and still hoping to do so. Instead of taking tour buses to see the area we might opt for hiring a car instead. A pain as I'm the one who'd be doing all the driving, but maybe the more sensible option.I've also booked to go to Spain in June. Fingers crossed that life can continue without major disruptions during this crisis. Holidays mean so much to people for obvious reasons."
Good on you acequion.
"Hopefully Portugal won't be closing its borders and we shall still be allowed over there. Doing a dummy booking for our holiday today, the price has dropped £125 since we booked 3 weeks ago. Cotswold's ,& Lake district etc in UK also seeing dramatic loss of business. As well as the usual high number of Asian tourists not present,other tourists staying away incase they are there apparently....I'm more worried about picking something up from the plane.Edited: 7:47 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"The level of ignorance of some British posters here is shocking.This is your life and your decisions but now is a bad time for a journey. Cancel your trip for a later time, period. You can have holidays from hell, for example, quarantine, stay in hospital or even death etc. There is no vaccine for this virus. You can catch the virus early on the plane. Health is more important and this is my opinion."
The level of hysteria from some Polish posters on here is shocking... This is my opinion.

"Hodge670, we arrived Armacao de Pera Saturday and the weather is unbelievably hot for March with temps of 27C forecast for tomorrow but, in the sun and round our hotel pool, its more like 34C. I’ve never known the weather to be like this on the Algarve and am having to seek shade under the parasol. The evenings are not chilly - it was about 17C last evening and everyone was out in short sleeves and some still in shorts - except for the Portuguese and the ex-pats of course whose blood has become thin adjusting to the climate. Its almost as hot as Goa in March!"
Well me and my partner are booked to go to Albufaira in June and still looking forward to it.... nothing is going to stop us going unless the government says different.You are just as likely to catch any virus at home anyway.
"We are booked to fly there next weekend from U.K. For a short holiday. Keeping eyes on the news and government guidance. If things don't go out of control, then we will continue with our holiday with due precautions. Heartening to know from some posts of people who have just come back that they still had a good holiday !"

"Can’t wait to get back on Sunday, would rather be isolated there than UK , but I don’t need to worry about my job. Had a scary ten minutes in doctors waiting room today with two people coughing. One a child who said Mum what happens if I’ve got corona virus. She’s coughed a lot and touched a lot of things. Probably more dangerous there!"
We are heading to Portugal in a couple of weeks..no matter what we are going.
"There’s so much uncertainty about the virus at present that it’s very difficult to know what’s the right thing to do.As happens with many different issues, you get a lot of people at either extreme. You have people stockpiling food and other goods, thereby creating shortages that cause other people to start stockpiling, leading to more shortages and so on. At the other extreme, you have people saying it’s all going to blow over and there’s no need to anyone to behave in any way differently to how they would normally behave. Either of these extremes is going to lead to undesirable consequences. I guess at a simplistic level, public health trumps all other concerns, but an extreme overreaction can also have an impact on public health, if it causes all economic activity to cease.I don’t know where the correct balance lies and I don’t think anyone knows this right now. Governments around the world are struggling to come up with the correct approach.As someone who lives in Dublin, I was very uncomfortable with the fact that several thousand Italian rugby fans who had booked flights and accommodation for the rugby international that was due to take place last weekend decided to come to Dublin anyway, even though the match was cancelled because of public health concerns.Now I find myself in a similar position to those Italian rugby fans. I’ve flights booked for next week and accommodation arranged and I had been looking forward to being back in Alvor. But I don’t know if I’m being irresponsible by travelling.What if I become exposed to the virus while travelling and end up being infected? What if I’ve already been exposed without knowing it and I become responsible for spreading it to those on the plane with me or those I meet while in the Algarve?And, if I don’t go, what about the impact on the livelihood of those people who rely on tourism for a living?I’m very torn and really don’t know what is the right thing to do. Would it be selfish of me to go, because I would be recklessly endangering others? Or would it be selfish of me to cancel, because I would be contributing to unnecessary panic and jeopardising the livelihood of people who I have come to know and respect over the past several years. Apologies for the length of this post, but I feel that it is a subject that requires reasoned debate and I would welcome the thoughts of others on their matter."
"The first thing any of us could or should do is if we have any symptons, a cold, cough etc get tested before travelling.At least then you know that you will not have it and be carrying to your destination.For all we know that may well become a rule at some time in the future.Those of us of a certain age will remember back in the late 70s there was a death from smallpox in the UK.We went to Yugoslavia that year and had to get smallpox injections before travelling as a condition of entry."
"As of today what's official in Portugal is that the initial infected persons (that have created the 6 active focus that we are having) are all portuguese that went on holidays or business mainly to Italy (one was to Spain and now apparently there's one to Germany/Austria).TAP and other companies are offering the possibility of changing flights without penalties. So if that's a possibility (many don't have it), why not?Portugal government has decided to cancel all flights from Porto, Lisboa and Faro to/from some airports in Italy (Milão-Malpensa, Internacional II Caravaggio (Bérgamo) e Internacional Marco Polo) from the 11 to the 24 march.Extra measures are being discussed everyday, so things can change rapidly...."
"I suppose it had to happen, the first of the big travel insurance providers AVIVA has announced that it is reducing the cover on NEW policies for travel disruption.Expect others to follow."
"We are in our 70's and due to fly out on 22nd,for our 4th visit. So far TAP have not cancelled our flight although they have cancelled some. We will travel out, unless medics/airlines say otherwise."
"We are now seeing the first precautionary measures down here in the Algarve. All local football has been cancelled until at least 28th March.The final of the Algarve Women's Cup, scheduled for tonight, was called off yesterday to allow the Italian party to find a way home before all flights are cancelled."
It seems that the UK is still lagging behind in preventative measures.Indoor concerts and events with up to a couple of thousand expected to attend still going ahead...Unless the UK comes into line with other countries on preventative measure it will not be will I travel but will I be allowed in.
"PaulV66 at post 48 captures the dilemma perfectly. We were looking at booking for early April however are now thinking this might be a bit irresponsible. Things in UK look to be ramping up, so god knows what the government guidance will be tomorrow, never mind a few weeks down the line,and as Cubsur indicates there are some early precautinary measures being applied in the Algarve. Much as I would love to be looking forward to another hoiday in a few weeks, it is a dilemma."
"Paul #48 I feel your pain, my sentiments exactly. We were due to fly at the weekend and feeling slightly unwell with cold symptoms, I have postponed our trip. I have no wish to inflict anything that I may or may not have, on any other passenger/crew or carry it to another country. The fact we've been able to reschedule flights, free of charge, means that we at least, will still spend the money abroad, (in fact we've swapped a weeks holiday for a fortnight, so will spend twice as much). But for those who lose their holiday and aren't able to do similar, it will have a huge impact on local businesses. I'm just hoping that all is well by summer and those that have delayed booking anything yet, will aid with the recovery by boosting bookings for the Autumn instead. I appreciate not everyone will be able to ride the storm but really hope that most can."
"My wife works for one of the very large pharma companies that is working on a vaccine for this virus . They were told 2 weeks ago to work from home until further notice and not to go to the office unless vital and if so go by private car .That notice has arrived and they are not to go to any office until 1st June . This is a global employee instruction .They have been instructed not to use any public transport and definitly not the london underground . They describe it as a very dangerous virus so i guess keep an eye on the government advice and don't treat this issue lightly .Edited: 8:45 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Quick heads up from Olhao for anyone coming over. It’s , business as usual great atmosphere around the town. . There is a worry though from some restaurant / bar owners about whether the virus situation will affect trade in the coming months. Other than that the weather is glorious !"
bi monthly bus station markets are now cancelled and some council services now only available online or by phone
"Also closed here in Albufeira until at least next Tuesday are swimming pools, sports halls, museums, galleries and the public library.Situation to be reviewed next Tuesday.The annual junior basketball festival scheduled for 2nd to 7th April is also cancelled."
"The next step will be closed schools, home office for companies, canceled flights, no mass events, empty shops, etc.Anyway the weather is perfect as mentioned in earlier posts. Have fun.Edited: 10:03 am, March 11, 2020 "
#57 Unless your prepared to name the company then all your doing is scaremongering like MSM. Just like the BBC saying reliable source.
little bit of panic buying in lidl loule recently. i shop there twice a week for the restaurant and opening time normally just a handful of clients. today about 30 people and several shelves were empty
"We are meant to be arriving next Sun (22nd) and determined that we would be going but things are changing so rapidly i think that its now not going to happen ! Our biggest fear is things changing whilst we are over ie flight bans, also my elderly mum in law is also meant to be coming and i think it would be a bit risky for her, more worried about the travelling than being in Albufeira to be honest. Will play it by ear but at the end of the day Albufeira will still be here when all this blows over, better safe than sorry."
"There is absolutly nothing going on in the Algarve, people still go out, the suportmarkets are prepared to suply the demand, life goes on as normal.Just for safety issues easter holidays for schools have started today instead of April and major events have been canceled."
"""Just for safety issues easter holidays for schools have started today instead of April and major events have been canceled.""thats quite a big step ."
"Given the lack of action in the UK, the Algarve looks like being a safer place to be.As of now, large public gatherings, concerts, indoors and outdoors still going ahead in the UK."
Just for safety issues easter holidays for schools have started today instead of April - NOT TRUE. It's still under discussion at the government level.
"It’s just been announced that all schools, colleges and childcare facilities in the Republic of Ireland are to close from tonight until March 29th. I’m thinking we might be safer over there, but not sure we’d be able to get back home if things get worse in Ireland and there’s also the concern about becoming infected on the flight or causing infection over there if unbeknownst to us, we have already contracted the virus."
"my elderly parents (85 and 83) are flying into Faro on Saturday for 3 weeks with two friends (slightly younger)...they are relatively fit and well but suffer from mild COPD......They seem untroubled but I, as son, seem more concerned and not about the current situation but about the changes in the next three weeks?"
"LV have also announced yesterday they have stopped new sales of Travel insurance.Luckily we have already got our holiday covered with them on our annual policy which ends after our holiday in June. They say that if government advice is not to travel to your holiday destination, if you do travel against advice then their cover will not apply."
"I'm over 70 with damaged immune system and heart prob. I was due to travel to Albufeira March 30 but I've now changed the date to 25 October, the latest date I can get with the operator. Perhaps the emergency will be over by then."
"Andrew, only you can make the decision about your elderly parents but, if they insist on flying out this Saturday, you must ensure they have excellent insurance cover and that they have declared all health and COPD issues.Coronavirus spreads very quickly and the situation in a week’s time, let alone in 3 weeks’ time, is impossible to guess.We flew out on Ryanair from Bournemouth last Saturday and are in Armacao de Pera for 2 weeks, but even we cannot be sure our return flight won’t be affected."
"Insurance companies are withdrawing cover.The latest, Liverpool and Victoria is stopping selling new policies for at least month."
"Much as it pains me to say it, I think things are going to get worse before they eventually improve. I can see at least the early part of the holiday season being very difficult, not only for Albufeira but for everywhere, with a drop in numbers travelling (or being allowed to travel) now looking inevitable"
"If we rescheduled to later in the year, our annual insurance policy with LV would have run out by then. Had trouble getting quotes off anyone else when we tried comparing prices because of amount of meds we are both on for hubbys heart failure and other conditions. (Even one saying they cover all conditions wouldn't quote, saying they would cover me but not hubby for medical emergencies. So we stayed with LV ). Looks like hols in the UK if we don't manage to have our June holiday in Albufiera that we've booked and LV won't renew our annual policy when it expires!"
2 cases confirmed in Portimao up the coast
New cases or the ones reported earlier this week.If the old news s a mother and daughter returned from Italy.
"Hi Stafford. You may find that if you have to claim for anything to do with Corona you won’t actually be covered, as I have a comprehensive policy and I’ve just had an email from my insurer seemingly pointing out I would have to pay extra for that cover! Of course there was no corona virus when I took out the policy."
We are coming to Albuferia at the end of this month and unless we are refused entry or refused leave from the UK we will still be coming.
"Im coming just after Easter,Luckily I dont have to pay the Hotel until 1st April. Hopefully things will be a lot clearer by then."
PM and his experts suggesting that it will not be over by Easter but will last a lot longer than that.No UK restrictions on travel to Portugal so far.
"Some Travel Insurance policies are covering in certain circumstances (FCO I assume?) although I'm sure there'll be an out clause somewhere. Fortunately for me I've nothing booked other than the Algarve, so won't be finding out. Received email today...<< As your current policy already has our Travel Disruption Extension cover on it, then you are covered for travel disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic as explained in your policy document. >>"
"AA. Yes, that’s it. I’m trying to see if mine has that cover on it. No point in ringing to find out as there is no chance of getting through to them.It is a comprehensive policy but I don’t see anything mentioning TDE. I have emailed them to ask but not expecting a quick reply!"
"We are here now in olhos de Agua and everything is going on as normal. The bars and restaurants are busy, supermarkets are well stocked up and our hotel is open and functioning as expected. I was very apprehensive before flying out but at this present time the corona virus seems a million miles away though I guess this will change very shortly. Our taxi driver on arrival told us many people are cancelling their holidays and they are very concerned about it. I thought I just give an up to date view as of today."
"Wandering Star - Thanks, just checked with LV. They are covering existing customers for Coronavirus. (As long as not travelling against FCO advice) .Also found out that they are still offering renewals to their existing customers. Got all my holiday spending Euros well in advance when the rate was 1.175 , so hope I get to spend it over there now !Edited: 2:49 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Thanks snaphappychap. Have a great holiday :)
"Thanks everyone for the info. My policy apparently doesn’t have TDE cover but what they would/wouldn’t cover us for is not too clear! I thought we were covered for all the important events! It was a good policy but I don’t remember anything about travel disruption extension at the time, or, didn’t notice it. Of course there was no covid-19 when I took the policy out and it never entered my head we’d need TDE cover!Edited: 5:53 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"ALL companies in the North Brabant region have requested people to work from home if possible. No idea if this is an over reaction. We were in Ischgl a few weeks ago. Now all apres ski is closed and the ski lifts will close for 2 weeks. Scheduled for Algarve in May. Difficult to know what to do, especially as the hotel is quite large and popular with older guests. We don't mind just spending the holiday walking in nature but if the hotel isn't functioning..."
Scheduled for Algarve in May - too soon to know. Every decision now if for March till early April...
"The dilemma is indeed knowing it's too early to know, but cancelling early incurs a much lighter penalty. Delaying doesn't solve anything for us. The cancellation costs only go up, and the uncertainty doesn't decrease. We didn't know Ischgl was affected until the day after we arrived home.I really feel for the older guests who love the Algarve as we do. And the hotel operators.We don't want to bring anything with us unknown from a region that has been hit quite hard so far (over 250 cases and counting). But if the virus does hit Albuferia I can't imagine the healthcare system in the Algarve being able to cope with large numbers of sick older tourists."
We are heading to Alvor in a couple of weeks...no refund.on hotels...3 weeks..leaving from Canada via London...hoping the borders stay open.
"The last poster 91 hits the nail on the head.Is it fair on the people of Portugal that tourists from areas of high infection but still travel free increase the risks in Portugal.Add to the pressure on a health system that is already struggling.But then if we do not travel the economic effects could be just as damaging.It's a real dilema. Cases now reported in Lagos linked to the ones in Portimao.Anyone attending hospital from these towns .has to wear a mask , sanitize hands etc.Edited: 5:02 am, March 13, 2020 "
One confirmed today in Albufeira. A Canadian.
Projected losses from falling tourist numbers will be 100s millions of Euros ( Algarve daily news )Zoomarine is restricting numbers.In Carvoeiro our local tennis and fitness club is following the new rules and limiting class sizes .This is peak golf season with every week 100s from across Europe normally arriving to play in the Algarve..Staying in hotels.
schools closed from monday. nightclubs closed and big public gathering cancelled. bars and restaurants must reduce capacity by one third. supermarkets and malls will limit numbers and people will queue outside rather than inside any building. these are the main points announced last night which may have an impact on tourists
"Given that the Algarve is still in its winter shutdown these restrictions will not have a serious impact on those who do travel.Many restaurants, bars etc have yet to open and will probably delay their opening until tourist numbers pick up ."
terry nearly all open and busy in oura. sensible measures that let us and tourists carry on pretty much as normal
"Yes, I have just got news about a Canadian man who was at a hotel near my home for 2 months. He has it and has been taken to Faro hospital. The whole area here must be infected now. Apparently he was feeling sick for a long time. Don´t come here.The hotel is the one at the Tres Palmeiras circle.Edited: 7:34 am, March 13, 2020 "
"But you must accept that tourist numbers are going to be affected in the months ahead.Portugal cannot avoid the economic impact that may last until the summer.Personally we will not be going out to eat,or to bars as much as before as we will be limiting public contact .."
yes numbers will be affected but if china a bench mark things could return a bit more normal 6-8 weeks after the peak which is likely in next 3 weeks which gives hope for main tourist season
"Few countries has taken the steps China took so you cannot compare events there to what is happening in Europe..Reduction in the spread will result from a reduction in contact, in travel..The UK government believes it will be months not weeks.If people avoid crowds , avoid contact in the UK then that is exactly what they should do elsewhere.Sit on the beach , play golf but avoid anywhere where you will be closer than 1 metre from the next person for extended periods.Hotels,apartments how deep will the cleaning be between guests.Where are the announcements from hotel chains detailing the steps they are taking."
"I am due to fly out in nine days and am not sure what to do. I have just contacted my tour operator (Jet2) waited 30 mins on hold. They said they would be willing to change my dates any time up to the end of April 2021. However I would have to pay £150 pp admin fee. Absolutely disgraceful, I expected to pay something for the change but £300 is extortionate."
But there are no travel restriction to Portugal so the airline is not obliged to do anything.
"TERRY R, I understand that there are no travel restrictions to Portugal at present. But we are in uncharted territory, as the Prime Minister said yesterday we are in the midst of a medical emergency that is a once in a generation occurrence. Easyjet are waiving the rebooking charge at present but it seems that Jet2 are not. I didn’t expect to change for free but £300 is very steep considering the circumstances."
Not yet!
Any update on pubs/nightclubs/restaurants closing?
"We are due to pay our Jet2 holidays balance next week. Got 11 weeks before we go. With our government trying to delay our peak until around that time, don't know what to do. Lose the deposit and cancel now , wait and see if FCO advice is to not travel and hopefully get a refund or holiday moved to later in the year, or wait and see if the situation improves and we can still go.....All UK football and other matches have been cancelled from today until 3rd April. (That's made the decision for us whether to go on the coach to a match we have tickets for tomorrow or not!)Edited: 9:35 am, March 13, 2020 "
james s. clubs closed and bars and restaurants asked to reduce capacity by a third to give people more space
"<< Any update on pubs/nightclubs/restaurants closing? >> Hopefully, it won't come to the temporary closure of bars/restaurants etc. but unfortunately, it's possible. TA_ have permitted 'Temporary Closure' notices to be placed on listings. I'll post the details for business owners on the Algarve forum."
"I've just read a post on a local travel forum here in Ireland about how Alfufeira is like a ghost town and how there might even be a lock down? Is that true or is it more hysteria? Im fully aware that this situation is deadly serious but exaggeration and hysteria don't help.We're due to go over on 6th April, booked into Hotel Falesia for 4 nights. It's looking increasingly unlikely but I haven't lost hope. It's not a holiday we can reschedule so if we lose it, that's it.Horrible times!"
"along with Italy, Jet2 have just announced there will be no outward flights to Cyprus, Czechia & Austria. So unfortunately it looks like only a matter of time before the Iberian peninsular is affected"
One case confirmed today but took 3 private hospital visits before public one diagnosed positive now in faro hospital they not named the hotel he was staying in
life goes on as normal except bars and restaurants being asked to lower their capacity to give people more space. we are as busy as previous years in our restaurant
So much for the so called superiority of private hospitals.
Message from Portuguese parliamentarians in advance of the Prime Ministers announcement tonight.Cancel everything and Stay at home.
Been checking the webcams .. counted around 600 on the main beaches ... looks fairly busy for mid-March ...maybe the precautions will work ..
"ChampaignSocialist - Where did you spot about Jet2 cancelling to Cyprus, Czechia & Austria.?I tried to find it , latest update I can find from Jet2 is yesterdays."
"It's not Jet 2 but countries closing their borders.Google the news sites.Edited: 11:43 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Aah , finally found something about it on TTG website - Thanks TERRY."
Best to keep an eye on their facebook.......https://m.facebook.com/jet2/
Evidence in the shops here this afternoon of some panic buying. Tourists though seem oblivious.
National site covid19.min-saude.pt says 6 cases in Algarve ..
"Thanks for facebook link algarveaddict . Very useful.I don't use facebook normally, so didn't think about Jet2 being on facebook with latest news, ( Using hubbys account now to keep track of it :) )"
An update we just spent the day on Falesia beach and people were sunbathing and swimming in the sea so I guess the gorgeous weather today made everyone forget about this virus. Also we went into the supermarket in Olhos de Agua and no restrictions with plenty of food and alcohol on the shelves. Also the lady outside the tourist shop tried to sell us excursion tickets and the hop on hop off bus still running too though I guess things could change at short notice
Just read a Canadian man in his 60s Staying in Albufeira has tested positive today.
Yes I am in albufeira and a canadian tourist was diagnosed yesterday I'm told 60% of hotels and resturaunts are closing but cant confirm that only heresay
Yes there is confirmed cases in albufeira I'm there right now and have been told (tho only heresay) that 60% of hotels are closing here
"Flying with TAp on Sunday to Quinta de Lago and not sure to go or not as more worried about lock down than actually getting the virus there does not seem to be any guidance from the airlines or hotel. Travelling with our two year old , anyone in quinta can a£ vice what the situation is like there at present"
Only the Portuguese government can determine if flights will be affected.The airlines and hotels know as much as any of us.
James @ 129. Suggest you look on the main ‘Algarve Forum’ where there are several threads on CV updated.
Just take precautions where ever you are ..but Albufeira is the safest place to visit..
Harit @ 132. What a ridiculous and irresponsible thing to say! Your first ever post on this forum and think you must have your own interests at heart. Everyone should look on the main Algarve Forum to get more accurate and up-to-date details.
National site covid19.min-saude.pt still says 6 cases in Algarve ... so that hasnt changed for two days ...
"I'm due to fly out on Tuesday 17th March to Albuferia , Is it safe to travel there and is everything still open etc ?"
"The actions taken by the government' is being followed by the population with bars, restaurants closing or reducing hours in every resort in the Algarve are designed at limiting the spread.Not preventing it, just limiting it., it cannot be prevented.We non Portuguese , tourists or resident should follow the advice from the Portuguese government. .If you find bars empty, no entertainment etc, Don,t complain its for your benefit as well..At least so far Portugal is still letting you in..Some Spanish resorts are now on lockdown, flights from the UK cancelled."
Here in Ayrshire there were 4 cases until 2pm Friday ..these figures would not deter me from travelling ... if flight is still going .. and that will be half empty I assume.
"We are supposed to go in May. This is such a light hearted answer. As long as I get my holiday first, I don't mind popping my clogs at the end of it lol x"
I know there a cases in Algrave not as many in albuferia - is there things still open like the stalls on the streets restaurants bars? is it still okay to travel there ?
"4 cases in Ayr and 6 in Algarve etc .These are the confirmed nos but as the chief medical officer for England said , we really don't know the true amount his best guess as of a few days ago was between 5000 and 10000 and that was when the recorded no was 600 .So yes the confirmed now might give an idea but they are far from giving the full picture . So this is the problem you just don't know who has it .Edited: 5:58 am, March 14, 2020 "
"As many have posted, there are no clubs open, bars and restaurants are closing or closing early.Markets cancelled..Is it safer than the UK.Only you can make that decision.."
Did you trip go ahead? We are travelling this Thursday and just wondering is it ok
Hey J Bradford - Im debating myself to go or not but unfortnately im going with the husband and in laws so its gonna have to be a mutal decision but read up most of the restuarants are closed bars and markets . we are due to fly on tuesday
"""...çread up most of the restuarants are closed bars and markets ""Not yet, as I said in reply to your other question on the other post.If I were in your position I would not come."
"Many Thanks - Cubsur , its my husband and the inlaws going and they all really want to go but Ive just been seing things that bar and resturants and stalls are closed and i wouldnt fancy been stuck in the hotel for the week ?"
"As I said they are not closed yet, but next week will almost certainly see a lot of closures, limited hours little available for the average tourist.And it's going to be raining.There is no good reason at all to be here next week."
"Thanks for the update Cubsur. I think you’ve made my mind up for me.Aer Lingus and Ryanair are waiving their change fee for flights in March, April or May and I can change to October flights for less than €100 in total. Seems like the only sensible option, although I feel sorry for the businesses that will be losing more and more custom as more and more people cancel their travel plans."
"I hope that Albufeira , the strip does not experience the problems seen in Spain where drunken Brits have objected to the 12.00midnight curfew there.Those of us of a certain age will remember the 10.30 , 11,00 closing time in pubs.As Cubsur has said better not to come if you are not going to get the holiday experience you were anticipating..I fear that Some bars , restaurants who only start to make money from now on will not make it through the year.The economic repercussions have yet to be appreciated.How will anyone on basic sick pay for weeks be able to afford a holiday this year.Edited: 6:59 am, March 14, 2020 "
"We should be out there now but I changed my flights earlier this week, when I felt unwell. The situation at the time in Albufeira was negligible, however I didn't want to put anyone at risk if I developed the virus. What a difference a few days have made.Numbers of confirmed cases are just that, without knowing the numbers being tested, it's not a true reflection of the situation. The total number of confirmed cases per million of population is currently 11.8 in the UK and 11.0 in Portugal, several days behind the UK in the infection period. Unfortunately with the close proximity to Spain, who are currently running at 111.9 cases per million of population, sadly the numbers in Portugal are likely to rise quite significantly. The Portuguese government are acting swiftly and rightly so."
Italy on lockdown.. Spain on lockdown and the same will happen in Portugal.. starts off with a few cases and then gradually escalates I'm not scaremongering cos I'm going out at the end of this month.. it also depends on the airline your flying with!
If you get here will you be able to fly back?
"I've changed my flights to October. Hopefully things will be back to normal (or something close to normal) by then, but who knows?"
StrappingJock@151 is right! Unless you’ve booked a return return flight you will most likely find it difficult to find a flight back.Some who spent the winter here and tried in the past week to get a flight home are finding the planes are “sold out”.
It is perfectly normal at this time of year to find seats hard to come by ... I just checked Easyjet Glasgow and Ryanair Prestwick for flights to Faro in the bext few days ... each has between 18 and 20 seats which may well fill up .. and as you say some are scrambling to go home ..so it will be difficult until the number of flights increasesearly April .. (more people coming in than going out) ..
"We have flights booked with easyjet to fly to Faro from Manchester next Sat 21st for a 10 day holiday. Our accommodation is a nice small villa complex in Bordeira so not a hotel and probably away from the resorts. Easyjet haven't cancelled yet and our accommodation is a non refundable rate, but as a young family, should we go ahead and hope for the best and go or accept we should cancel whether we can get there or not. Our fear is being stuck there once we're there and nothing to access, could they also close the beaches?"
<< .....could they also close the beaches? >> I sincerely hope not but the order has been given in areas of northern Portugal.
"Unfortunately I didn't cancel my trip , should have went with my gut feeling and stayed home , but thanks to you and many more on here that were living in a bubble I decided to travel , big big mistake the place is like a ghost town , atmosphere is terrible , just today Eddy's bar shut down and I am hearing the whole place will be on lockdown ,my advice to anyone is don't travel .this is not going to end well ."
the strip at 2pm was not a ghost down. in the oura area at least 50 bars and restaurants and cafe open. we had our busiest saturday day session so far this year. lots of people milling around. cant believe what gets posted on here - about as much fiction as some of the reviewsif i could post pics i would showing people still having fun but exercising caution and personal space
"Just a reflection on our day today and what we saw. Mid morning we caught a taxi from Olhos de Agua to Vilamoura and we was very apprehensive about what the day would bring. On arrival at the marina everything seemed normal with bars and restaurants open and touting for business and we even saw a couple of stag parties parading around. We sat outside O’Neils and had a beer and others were enjoying their selves playing cards and laughing. We then walked back to Olhos de Agua along Falesia beach enjoying the hot sunshine on route sitting and watching the para gliders taking off from the cliffs. The whole day was very relaxed and looking at everyone else this virus seemed a million miles from peoples minds. We took a chance coming here but at the moment I feel more worried about going home and what to expect there. This report is what I saw today but we are taking one day at a time but tomorrow could be a different story! Edit I totally agree with the previous postEdited: 3:32 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"snappyhappychap - glad you are having a good holiday so far and thanks for reporting . Please keep posting the latest daily as we are trying to decide what to do over the next few days. (whether to cancel before we have to pay the balance next saturday and just lose the £120 deposit, cancel and reschedule to later in the year which will also cost us £80 , or hope for the best and still come over at end of May....more worried with hubby having heart failure if taken ill over there )"
"I would ask the Cottage to post a picture of the strip at 12.00pm and compare it to a normal Saturday night in mid march and then tell us that nothing has changed,.."
"Got to agree with you TERRY R. Got two lots of friends in Albufeira at present and they are very apprehensive about what going on. Read on Portugal News today that the manager of Forte Du Vale was interviewed and the hotel was only being monitored.After a positive case has been identified there. Think Cottage is playing the strip up to protect his business. One of the regular posters a Resident on here has advised people to stay away, what does that tell you ."
"I booked non refundable room,,,but I emailed them ,and because of corona they said I can cancel without and fee if I wish"
"Stop with your nonsense cottage , I am here now , and at least 50 % of bars and restaurants are closed , and by Monday nothing will open , anybody thinking of traveling , please don't it's a ghost town"
"I was due to fly out sunday 15th but i have made the decision not to fly ..... its not worth the risk in my opinion i was also due to book for may but i won't be , I'm thinking of trying again in october if everything dies down. I think feel sorry for businesses as a few no doubt will fold due to lack of customers and restrictions of opening hours and capacity ect"
"Been speaking to a few friends who have bars/work in old Town and they are either already closed or closing tomorrow for at least 2wks, was also told Piccadilly closing tomorrow."
law today says bars must close at 9pm. i think as some poster says above they all close from monday that they would not have made this law today. and i was talking about the strip at noon terry 12pm not the 12pm which you suggest is night time 12 o'clock which is actually 12am. i did not say it was as busy as a previous mid march - just that with a later easter this year its quite busy for mid march
"Unfortunately it's looking like this could drag on for months, and Albufeira will suffer like everywhere else, and shutting down for two weeks is not going to cut it. My uneducated guess would be that the majority of this main tourist season will be lost. I only hope and pray that businesses can survive and will still be there maybe for a busy September/October"
"Just read UK govt will soon be bringing in the decision to instruct all over 70s to self isolate for 4 months , even if they feel well and have no symptoms.Looks like lots won't be allowed to go on holiday even if feeling healthy and wanting to.Going to have to make our decision tomorrow as to whether to lose money and cancel , or pay to reschedule in the hope things dramatically improve. Can't see it all being back to normal by end of May :(Our holiday is going out to restaurants for evening meal and then touring the bars all night. Might be in our 60's , but still young at heart and enjoy some lively nightlife. Looks like that won't be happening if we do actually get to come over in May!"
"Stafford jas, sounds like your idea of a good holiday is exactly same as ours, and were both closer to 60 than 50. Unfortunately for now anyway it's looking more and more likely that you won't get that holiday. We were close to booking for early April, but decided against it. Somehow with what's going on it just didn't feel right. Hoping to get back later in the year, please god !"
"JohnP033 - Think you are right about looking like not going to get our holiday.Reading a post , pointing out the whole of the hotel will be on lockdown if a guest gets the virus, has helped our decision . We like walking out in the daytime as well, would hate to have to spend a fortnight stuck in a hotel room.Just checked , only 76 days to go so not much time for things to get back to normal by then. Can cancel on line if just losing the deposit , got until friday....Also did a dummy booking and a hell of a lot of previously reserved seats on our planes have suddenly become available . (Hotel price dropped another £200 as well.)Same holiday in September is available, but can't book that incase we can't get insurance. Our annual policy expires in July , LV say they are just doing annual renewals at the moment (no new policies) ,but can't guarantee it will be renewed when the time comes.Oh well, hopefully we will be able to rebook later in the year or early next year. Is the weather usually decent in March/April ?"

Terence151. What a shocking post! Please take it down.
Ghost town here in Armação de Pera also. Police (GNR) calling into bars last night telling them to close at 9 p.m.Most restaurants will be closed after today if they haven’t already. Tourists just arriving this weekend are looking for flights home. We leave next Saturday as scheduled and have decided to eat in our hotel’s restaurant until then.
"Same here, due to fly out today, accommodation contacted us Friday night to cancel booking with a full refund. So decided not to travel .Edited: 9:59 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Looking like our June 30th Holiday with Jet2 may be in doubt, never mind April & May they are basically gone. Only time will tell if our insurance covers us for all of our holiday cost. September we have booked flights and Hotel seperately so may lose all of our Hotel money which we paid for in full last November, However with Easy Jet we took out insurance so maybe get full refund for flightsEdited: 10:25 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Why, the UK government is targeting over 70s."
Over-70s - and younger people with certain health conditions

"Another update we have just spent the day on Falesia beach walking halfway up to Vilamoura and then back along the cliffs and again it was a very relaxing day. We started the day by first doing some shopping in the supermarket in Olhos de Agua and with no restrictions of people entering and lots of food and drinks on the shelf so no problems buying what we needed. The snack bars on the beach were open and many locals, tourists and families with children playing and sunbathing on the beach and also being another fantastic day some braving the cold sea for a dip. We also saw many joggers and hikers so again as yesterday it seemed as though no one had a care in the world. Our hotel is fantastic with hygiene very high and this morning tables laid out with large gaps between them. Everything seems to be going on as normal including nearby ones too but for how long who knows. Even though I have given a very positive feedback personally if I was at home and thinking of coming within the next couple of days I would seriously consider cancelling not because of what is happening here at the moment but what could happen in the very near future and the unknown"
"William B, post 180. You’re not alone, many on here would happily contribute to the fare!! But which of the 2 Terry/Terries?"
We should be coming over on April 6th should we be cautious and cancel or still fly over. I'd rather keep my holiday to be honest.
Hi providing flights are not cancelled we are due to fly on the 6th april is there abby issues in praia da gale? I don't want to worry unnecessarily.
"We go in May hope flights get back to normal and I don’t have to swim there as it is an awful long way. Just back from Fuerteventura last night and it was awful, let’s hope this is over soon the holiday resorts and there economy need our money ."
Don't go
The President of the Spanish state of Andalucia has demanded that the Spanish government close its borders including that with Portugal.
I hope to be proved wrong but i suspect that we are only yet seeing the tip of the iceberg so to speak.We came home from Olhos dAqua on Thursday and were due to return on 21st April but there is no chance i believe.We have the chance to change flight at no charge except fare difference and i am thinking about September and dont even know if this is secure.
"Latest news provided by Portugal Resident newspaperhttps:/…If the link isn't direct, copy and paste into your browser bar."
Thank you for that update.
"I know the feeling Tina A. We're also due to come out on the 6th April but it really doesn't look like it now. We're just gutted. I haven't done anything about cancelling as it's still 3 weeks away and if they close the borders I'll at least get refunded or compensated by insurance so it's a wait and see. Unbelievable how everything has changed in a week since this thread started. Unbelievable how the world as we know it can literally change overnight. My heart goes out to all those affected, either directly by the virus or whose businesses will fold."
"Thanks for that Jayjan .Certainly is very scary how quick this whole thing is escalating. We took the decision to cancel our 30 May holiday tonight , just losing our deposit. Hopefully we will be able to rebook later in the year, or around this time next year. Absolutely gutted , and hard to click the button to do it, but with health problems feel it's the best decision."
Update. Tourism between Spain and Portugal to be stopped.As we know The Algarve is a very popular tourist destination for the Spanish.Cross border trade and those who live in one country but live in another will continue under regulation..Scource Reuters.
Did you goI am supposed to be there for a week
"I think it's time to be realistic. If you have plans to travel almost anywhere in the world in the next 2-3 months (could be longer) it aint gonna happen. The whole world is starting to go in to meltdown and the list of countries closing borders gets longer by the day. As I said in a previous post, just hoping that businesses can survive until hopefully we come out of this later in the year and get travelling again"
"We may rediscover the ?delights? of Blackpool, Bognor and Saltcoats."
I'll need to hunt out the bucket and spade and knotted hanky.
"Oi, my out laws not far from Bognor -Behave!"
"We've decided to cancel our trip scheduled on 29th March, Just hoping for some sort of lockdown either in the UK or Portugal so we've got a better chance of a refund. Ryan air are giving the option to reschedule our flights without the admin fee but I'd much rather not schedule another holiday/flight with all the uncertainty. We have a trip to Ibiza booked for July so I've got everything crossed for that one. We are unbelievably gutted, we have made the same winter trip every year for the past 6/7 years. We usually come in Jan or Feb so its sods law that the one year we book later this happens. Keep safe everyone!"

10 cases in Algarve
HelloThere was one confirmed case of a canadian tourist he was transferred to the hospital in faro He is 80 yrs old
I am in abufiera now have been here for 3 mths
"You may be here for a lot longer than that unless you can leave within the next 2 or 3 days.Edited: 7:36 am, March 17, 2020 "
You may be here for a lot longer than that unless you can leave within the next 2 or 3 days. WHY?? all airlines have said they would repatriate.
why?
"In relation to "" panic buying "" is it not sensible to buy enough food and essentials , who knows how long this will go on for , I'd rather know I have enough food to feed my family than trying to shop in a months time to find empty shelves People are probably buying more than they need but o wouldnt say stocking up isnt a good idea especially those parents who have children off school for an undetermined time what are they supposed to eat People should be less judgey"
"Anthony hardly anyone elses fault that YOU chose to travel based on forum reviews,everyone has their own ideas on what is acceptable to themSome may or may not like it busier , in the end the choice was yoursJust saying!"
Safari279601 Thank you I now have no toilet paper or eggs or flour thanks to people like you going through stores like a plague of locusts
"Re .... ’is it not sensible to buy enough food and essentials , who knows how long this will go on for’ No it’s not it’s irresponsible ! ..spot on Ian f Just saying ."
"Even though this may not be the place, I thought I would add my opinion. As I see it here are two possible outcomes:1. We all follow the advice and only buy what we need and there will be plenty for everyone.2. We all think ""everybody for themselves"" and there will be shortages.I'm going for option 1."
"Elitemagpie , It’s not the place correct , but it wound me up a bit !!! I Don’t usually get into arguments / opinion etc . It’s a tense time ."
"Elitemagpie , It's down to that old question ,we all have a choice and which person do you want to be ? , I.m with you . !"
"Brits should learn from the Portuguese.No mad panic buying, shelves full, no shortages.No huge queues.A far less selfish nation."
"I am surprised that anyone does not feel disgust and pity for those who have deprived the less fortunate, the elderly , the infirm of the basics needed to live., to cope with this crisis.We Brits have nothing to feel proud of .Who else saw the care worker in tears this morning on BBC unable to buy even the basics due to selfish panic buyers.Posters on this and many other forums frequently post criticisms of the Portuguese.Thus time we have much to learn from them.. In Portugal golf courses closed, In the UK open.Clubs, closed weeks ago, in the UK still open.Bars, restaurants in the UK still open, no restriction on hours.In Portugal if still open opening hours limited.In the UK all shops open, in Portugal only those regarded as "" essential "" still open.Those panicking and rushing to get back to the UK could be leaving the frying pan for the fire.."
"All restaurants, fast food outlets and bars here were ordered to close yesterday. Restaurants can offer take aways and home delivery, but it will be many weeks before anyone can sit down for a meal or a drink.Public transport is still running, but trains have already been cut back. Buses in the Algarve will no longer take cash on board for fares, You must have a pre paid ticket or pass.These little things and more will gradually bite.I popped into my local corner shop yesterday for some bread etc. No evidence of panic buying.Last night it was eerily quiet outside."
the beaches open?
"Really??? The beach? Nobody can go out of the house for leisure! Yes you can for a small stroll around your house, but that's it!"
"It's now raining hard here in Albufeira, so you would not be on the beach anyway.The beaches are not physically closed That would be impossible. But there is no possibility of any kind of 'leisure' activity even if it wasn't raining.Going out for a bit of a walk for some exercise is fine, provided your keep your distance from others."
"Just had a look on the beach webcams and even allowing for the weather I can't ever recall seeing the place look so quiet, even in the depths of winter.Quite sad to see."
"Cubsur, you are so lucky. Here we are not allowed to go for a walk outside or cycle. The beaches have been taped off by the police and they are monitoring infringements through the webcams. There are police and civil guard checkpoints on the roads checking there is only one person in a car and where you are going, checking papers etc. This decree covers the whole of Spain and the islands. Fines start at €100 and go up to €600,000. It is grim, but better than getting ill and dying."
"you are so lucky - for now... we are also in state of emergency and if these ""softer"" measures (which are the ones that the government wanted) will not decrease the very high daily rate of infection that we are having in a short period, we'll be exactely like that. And the probability is high, when people are more concerned if they can go to beach or not (as you can see)."

how many people have corona virus in faro
"Now over 40 in the Algarve, expect it will grow at the same rate as everywhere else until the effect of the lockdown kicks in at least.2-3 weeks"
"There's a publication by council, done by the regional heath authority …min-saude.pt/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/202…"
These can only be used as a rough guide as they are only confirmed cases . When the chief medical officer for the uk said we had 650 cases he also added the real amount was probably around 5000 .
"These can only be used as a rough guide as they are only confirmed cases - and the point is?? That it's impossible to known the real number wherever you are in the world?? That's a lapalissade...Edited: 6:02 am, March 24, 2020 "
number of deaths x 1000 is a better guide to number of people infected

Given that you can have or have had the virus with no serious symptoms how can anyone know just how widespread the infection has been and will be.
https:/…53498 8 cases till 25 march in albufeira...better don't come stay home stay safe

#239 A home made Coronavirusirus medicine? Seems unlikely.
Glad to see that #239 has been removed. Mad though it may seem there are New Agers and Crystal Twirlers out there who would give it a try in preference to the medical gudance.
There is not a chance there will be any foreign travel this year IMO. Forget your holidays and fix you houses up.
"3rd fatality in the Algarve, an elderly British resident of Benagil.Stay safe everyone..The state of emergency could continue until June."

"Quite a few cases = 0.05% of the Algarve population confirmed as infected and for 3 % of them it's beenfatal.The doors were closed quickly enough to keep most of it at bay and, as said, have stayed closed since.The latest 'outbreak' down here concerned 18 Indian and Nepalese (??) agricultural workers living in appalling conditions in a 'warehouse' near Tavira, where all 18 are down with the virus. That plus a similar situation a couple of weeks ago in Faro has skewed the figures.No-one can safely predict when or even if this will end, or what will happen even if it does clear up by let's say June.

"Intersting snippet from BBC newsnight .The Spanish tourism minister said that Spain will open to tourism when it is "" Safe "" only to visitors from "" Safe "" countries.Will tourists worldwide in future have to carry a certificate of vaccination, a certificate of a recent negative test.Certainly things are going to change ."
"Terry, if that is the case, I guess I will never be leaving Ireland again. ZERO chance I will take any vaccine offered up."
"Dont see any likelihood of a certificate if the UK Government cant test people now ... in any case around 90% of people are relatively unaffected by Covid-19 .. and they should be ok to travel by June.

"UK lockdown to be extended., with no unnecessary travel.The news is far from as optimistic as suggested A test will be developed, a vaccine will be developed but until then nobody should be suggesting any return to normality for some time yet.Certainly no one in The Portuguese government is suggesting any change to current restrictions.Edited: 10:42 am, April 08, 2020 "
There has been another death from the virus in the Algarve.The President has said that there will be no relaxation of the current containment measures which suggests a further extension of the current emergency measures.
"Re #248.......Wouldn't think it will be a certificate, far too easy to forge. If anything of the sort is set up, I imagine it will be done electronically, via passports, visas etc. Don't know where that would leave free movement in Europe, though?"

The PM of Portugal according to a report in the Portugal resident has suggested that the state of emergency could stay in place until the 17th May.That is another 5 weeks.
"Some time ago the UK government starterd work on a form of ID card, spent Zillions and gave up because they couldn't get a computer system to work.

For reasons yet to be determined Albufeira is the current virus hotspot in the Algarve with the highest number of infections.Two Algarve camaras have yet to record any cases.Portugal News.
The algarve news is reporting lots of 'out of towners' in albufeira at the moment. Let's hope it rains all week.
"It is concerning that the first cases in Portimao could be traced back to Italy but the increase in Albufeira is thought to be transmission within the community.Supermarkets busy with "" visitors "" can hardly be helping .Applying even tighter controls on movement in Albufeira is one of the options being considered..Our local Intermarche in Carvoeiro was very quiet yesterday with strict controls on numbers and spacing."
"Continente in Albufeira also has security guards at the entrance and exit who are controlling numbers within the store. There was hardly anyone in there on Thursday morning.I am thinking that, with most people not working, shopping hours have been spread out across the 12 hours of opening rather than being concentrated into a few peak periods.The likely best way to stop any virus spreading is to enforce a 24 hour curfew for maybe 14 days. For everybody, no exceptions. Do we really want that?The severe restrictions on travel during the Easter holiday are in force but families in cars are ignoring the laws and the GNR apparently powerless to enforce them, so why bother? The few who have no cars could not travel as there are no long distance trains or any national coach services operating from Thursday last until Tuesday next.We cannot go on like this indefinitely. Someone has to make the call after perhaps May 1st (expiry of next two weeks of emergency) for a gradual return to some form of reasonably normal life, while accepting the hard fact that some people will die.PS carrying ID is mandatory for all adults in Portugal, even tourists."
"""PS carrying ID is mandatory for all adults in Portugal, even tourists.""Hi CubsurI have to say that's news for me. I knew that you had to carry a driving licence (plus photo ID if this was not part of the driving licence) when driving a car. I wasn't aware of any broader requirement.Does this mean that we could be stopped at any time when out and about in the Algarve (which hopefully will be some time this year) and asked to produce photo ID?"
"Hi. Yes, you need to have your passport with you when driving, or it might be possible to get away with an authenticated copy signed by a solicitor or notary."
I was checked once on a bus from Faro by GNR. All I had was a photocopy of my passport photo page. They were happy with that.
"""""PS carrying ID is mandatory for all adults in Portugal, even tourists."" I have to say that's news for me."" That's the law, since ever... In Portugal the driving license is not an ID document."
"I’m amazed. You say that this requirement applies to everyone, not just tourists. How long has it been in place?My wife and I have been regular visitors to Portugal since the 1980s and have owned an apartment in Alvor since 2007. Since we bought the apartment, we have visited Alvor around 60 times and never once have we been asked to produce ID, other than at passport control in the airport.We were never made aware of this requirement, other than being told when hiring a car that we had to carry photo ID with us when driving. As our driving licences include a photo, we thought this would be all we would need, if stopped.What would happen if you were stopped and asked to produce ID and were unable to do so?Edited: 5:19 am, April 12, 2020 "
"We have been stopped a number of times and our UK photo driving license has always been sufficient, not asked for passportHowever a friend was fined for not having any I'D on them..If in any doubt carry your passport."
"We always carry a photocopy of our PP's for ID.Also, if we were ever to lose the original, we'd have handy the details required to assist with emergency TD's."
Thanks folks. I think carrying a photocopy of the passport (and also having a photo of this on your phone) sounds like the most sensible option. I don’t think it makes sense to carry your passport with you at all times due to the hassle it would cause if it was lost or stolen. And it makes it well nigh impossible to go for a swim on the beach unless you have someone with you to keep an eye on your stuff while you’re swimming.
"You say that this requirement applies to everyone, not just tourists. For everybody.How long has it been in place? Well I'm portuguese and I was always told that we have to carry our ID card with us all the time. We do have an ID card (now a standard EU Cartão Cidadão).

"Why is that, because of the lockdown, closed borders.Who in Portugal wants to open the country to tourists and travellers from countries with much higher infection rates.Portugals reaction and early action has received praise from across the world.."
"Non tourist sector makes up 90%,"
The figure I used was based on a report that 1 Euro in every 5 spent in Portugal was related in one way or another to tourism...
"Tourism accounts for 11.3% of Portuguese GDP. The national statistical institute recently showed that ""a reduction in 25% in the tourist activity, both in the tourism of non-resident visitors and in domestic tourism, will translate into a 2.9% reduction in annual GDP in Portugal"". But I believe that under the circumstances the ""phantom"" of a major crash of the national health system will have, still for a long period, a bigger impact on whatever decisions are going to be taken."
"Report today that Portugal is running out of the necessary components etc so that it can continue testing so infection figures will not be an accurate reflection of what is happening.Masks may also become mandatory in certain public areas.,e.g. , shops , post offices."

"""I imagine this is something of a worldwide phenomenon as people become increasingly fed up with the restrictions.

Calamity sounds more serious than emergency. Any idea what that might involve?
Why don't we wait until the government announcement on Thursday rather than trying to second guess.
"Calamity sounds more serious than emergency. Any idea what that might involve? It's not in the sense of the ""powers given"" to the government (and police/army). In our constitution, above the state of emergency it's only ""Estado de Sítio"" state of siege.In general terms with""calamity"" it's possible ""establishment of “sanitary and safety fences; limitation or restriction of the movement of people and vehicles; free access by Civil Protection agents to private property; use of private natural or energy resources; temporary access to “goods or services, depending on the” degree of urgency or public interest."" It seems not very different but in those intricate words of the law it is a bit different... one of the things might be (with time) to have regions in a state of calamity and others without."
"Interesting article, re: state of calamity.https:/…53403"
ptnov64 - Thanks for the explanaton.
"AT - that was the only council in the mainland Portugal where the virus transmission was so high that a sanitary fence was imposed, so besides being in state of emergency like the rest of country they were also under extra measures.This will not be the situation for the entire country if state of calamity will be declared. Because one thing that is going to happen is the slow return of the economical activities now closed. And in Ovar even some of the ""allowed"" activities under the state of emergency were shutdown at that time, now the fence was lifted and they are like the rest of the country..."
"Thanks for clarifying ptnov64. As you say, it sounds very similar to a state of emergency, but with some extra measures thrown in that would be difficult to operate on a State wide basis.Edited: 3:48 am, April 27, 2020 "

"Just been reading this what Antonio Costa had to say about the lifting of the state of emergency: António Costa described, a few moments ago, the new social rules that will be adopted in May and at the beginning of Juno, after the lifting of the State of Emergency.As of Monday, May 4, new rules of the State of Calamity come into force with the aim of allowing a phased return to normality, in various sectors.In the next week several stores will start to open, but there are things that do not change: teleworking will continue to be mandatory, for example; confinement is also recommended and becomes a ""civic duty"", warns António Costa, to continue to avoid contagion: ""It is not because of the state of emergency that the health emergency ends"".Limit of gatherings is now ten peopleEvents with more than ten people are prohibited, but funerals are not covered by this limitation. In churches, the right to worship also has softened rules and it is now possible to attend masses in any religion.Street shops of less than 200 square meters, hairdressers, barbers, retail trade, stands, bookstores, beauticians, libraries and dedicated public services (mandatory booking) are allowed to open doors, but always with “special safety, hygiene, health ”, in accordance with the rules of the DGS, such as the use of masks in serving the public.Mask will be mandatory on public transportPublic transport will start to have a capacity limited to 2/3 and it will be mandatory to wear a mask. On the 4th of May there is one more thing that is beginning to be allowed: outdoor sports, where surfing should be included , for example.When the second half of May (18th) arrives, the opening of restaurants and cafes will be evaluated, with a maximum occupancy of 50%, at which time the opening of stores with an area greater than 400 square meters will also be allowed."
Progressing towards the new normal.I doubt that this will result in tourists in any significant numbers returning to the Algarve. How will any bar restaurant operate profitably at 50% capacity.
The algarve will probably be the most popular tourist destination for 2021
"As Portugal heads towards the perfectly termed ‘new normal’ and people start thinking about the possibility of a holiday this year......think about the UK dealing with the new normal. I have 17 days booked for August and would love to be there but I’m 95% certain I will not be travelling. Here’s why, Manchester Airport in the new normal! It’s chaos at security standard. The ‘arrive 2 hours’ before you fly would need to be 6-8 hours with social distancing. The food outlets (if they are open) the shops/toilets etc would be queueing round the airport. Near impossible to social distance in a airport. You cannot social distance on a aeroplane. How many times have you got off a flight and picked up a sniffle/sore throat/cough etc from being in a airtight space. Then you arrive at Faro, masks required, social distancing etc to get through passport control (in August!!!) Collection of luggage as the brits push and shove for their cases (it’s been a very long day by now) Then finally you arrive at you resort which has all the ‘new normal’ rules in place. Restaurants/bars with limited tables (in August! Hard enough getting a table on the night as it was) so it’ll probably be takeaway most nights. The strip and old town in Albufeira in August has many hundreds walking around in the evening, same in Alvor (how would this be social distanced?) Not possible. Swimming pools will be off limits. Water parks closed. For me, this would be a more relaxed lockdown in the sun. But the most pertinent point is the chances of catching COVID 19. It will still be around all summer. Catching COVID 19 in a foreign country would be a nightmare. Quarantined from your family and stuck in hospital whilst they have to fly back. Dealing with the insurance etc. As much as I’d love to spend my usual thousands of pounds to help the tourism trade this year....the reality is it won’t happen."
"nice one M60-TFS1, do you do kids parties?"
"The Times has an article uggesting that when flights resume the min Check in time will need to be 4 hrs to cope with the necessary changes following the return to the "" New Normal "".Countries will only start to accept tourists when the risk to their populations is eliminated.Why should Portugal accept Brits, Swedes, Dutch, Germans, French , Italians et al when their infection and death rates exceed those in Portugal..Edited: 7:44 am, May 01, 2020 "
Have to admit that the thought of flying doesn't sound appealing whatsoever. I think we will be looking to drive when we next venture on holiday.
"No new cases of Covid-19 again yesterday in Algarve, still only 13 have died .. fingers crossed for no re-lapsefrom Monday .."
"Prymans.The decision to ease the regulations is based on the picture in all of Portugal, not just the Algarve.Better to post the national picture and it's isteady mprovement.What happens in Porto and Lisbon matters far more than the siuation in the Algarve ."

"loftywex, I imagine the lack of tourists combined with the lockdown, which by all accounts has been very well adhered to, has definitely kept the numbers down. The big test is what happens in the next few weeks once the restrictions are gradually lifted. Germany has seen an increase in cases since they relaxed restrictions.I know what you mean by being on a plane, we have decided that we will be driving down, rather than fly for our next holiday."
Germany has extended its ban on unnecessary foreign travel until June 14.Germany is ahead of the UK in its relaxation of virus restrictions.This dies not bode well for any significant return of tourist flights in June.

Great link pyrman. Good to see actual facts and figures
"No surprise that some do not know why Portugal acted so early and so severely.Compared to other countries listed Portugal is poor, one of the poorest in Europe. It has an overstretched under resourced health service. Anyone who has read posts on the conditions at Faro and Portimao hospital will know that it would have taken very little to totally overwhelm their ability to treat virus victims. That is the reality, not something you will learn from charts on the Internet."

Maybe no flights but will boats be able to access the marina?
As far as I can tell No. Cruise ships are only allowed to let Portuguese nationals and residents off.

William b that might become clearer tomorrow when we hear the decree. As there has been no mention of airports / maritime ect so far as I have seen. Just the cruise ship restrictions
Many thanks #353/354.

Great pics as usual cubsur. What’s the name of the small bar that sits beside the building with the steelwork?
The green tiled building has deteriorated a lot since we last saw it.It was derelict back in 2004.Are the supports a sign of redevelopment or to stop it collapsing in the street.
Last October I heard it was being redeveloped but it was only a passing comment.

Amazed it’s to only come in now Terry. But there again that’s the UK government for you.
"Being asked to self quarantine for 14 days would not stop us from travelling.We've been in lockdown for 7 weeks, why would we worry about another 14 days?"
"Not if you have a job,two weeks on holiday then two weeks in forced quarantine.How would you explain that to your employer.Not being able to go to the shops, go out for a walk.."
"Algarveaddict, how many people could take 2 weeks holiday and then a further 2 weeks off work in order to quarantine? Not enough to sustain mass tourism that's for sure.The UK ought to have closed all borders when the lockdown first started, only allowing UK residents back in and making them quarantine."
"Don't disagree but the clue is in my post, it would not stop us from travelling. 4 or 5 weeks in Portugal would be safer than here.Not going out to the shops, going for a walk. We haven't crossed the door in 7 weeks.Edited: 5:54 am, May 09, 2020 "

"The UK went in to lock-down on 23rd of March when we had 6,600 confirmed cases and 335 total deaths. Today we had 3,877 new cases and 210 deaths in the last 24 hours (the number of deaths recorded will be lower than actual due to weekend registering). Current estimates are there are around 250,00 people infected with the virus in the UK. In what universe do those numbers support the easing of any lock-down measures. The lock-down is being eased only because the NHS now has spare capacity and we have all the new Nightingale hospitals ready. Remember the initial UK government response was to build up herd immunity. It looks like that is still the plan."
There is no evidence that herd immunity exists so the risk remains until a vaccine is developed.
"This idea that maybe countries that had lax measures and haven't done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity – and so what if we lose a few old people along the way?““ “This is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation,” Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program, said at a briefing on Monday.”"

"Herd immunity does exist for other viruses/diseases. The magic number is 60% of the population need to have immunity to keep the rate of infection (R value) below one. I think Terry you meant that as yet there is no evidence that having had Covid 19 means you have immunity and for how long, which would indeed make the whole idea of herd immunity worthless."
"There are cases where people have had COVID 19 but still don't have immunity barriers to it, so could catch it again. Some folks have had it and didnt even know they had had it as symptoms were so mild, until they proved positive on a test. Until this virus is truly understood we are no more the wiser. Just my opinion. Stay safe folks and stick to the rules the best you can as its the only safe way for you and your family. Hopefully we can fight and end this virus within the future. How long it will take is another question."
There's no guarantee there will be any lasting immunity from or vaccine against covid 19. Many common colds are caused by Corona Viruses. No vaccine has yet been developed for the common cold.
The temporary corona virus field hospital in Portimao will remain open for the summer as a contingency measure.There is also a virus test centre in Portimao.
Another UK gov muppet on tv but this one looks like Frank Spencer.Think we need a modern day Guy Fawkes to stop this daily nonsense.

Wow why are their lots of posts been deleted by T/A have I missed something.BTW AgentNiKky did you get a reply from Safe Communities Portugal re the 14 day quarantine?
No reply as yet. William and Terry having another spat so they got reported and deleted.
"AgentNikky I have had a reply from them: copied and pasted from their reply ""It's mandatory in Madeira and Açores, but not for the rest of the country. It's a recommendation, but it can become mandatory if the results from health screenings and temperature checks being done at the airport lead to being put under active vigilance - Eliana"" . So from that answer it still could be put in force.mmmm, re the deleted posts , I thought that might be the case lol, thanks for confirming.Edited: 5:28 pm, May 17, 2020 "
Cool. Thanks for that. Probably not needed if faro airport closed and Spain having 14 days quarantine no one can get here either way. Sad sad world.
Big problem for future months is UK tourists going home from Portugal after their holiday if the 14 day quarantine is still in force when they arrive back in UK That maybe will put a lot of UK tourist off going on holiday in the first place . We will see what the future holds..
"Azores has announced this sunday that they will no longer impose a mandatory quarantine of 14 days at arrival. The reason being that it's against the portuguese constitution (we are no longer under State of Emergency), this was the Ponta Delgada court decision when a Azores' resident filled a complaint against the regional government. He arrived a week ago and was placed at the mandatory hotel for quarantine, he filled the complaint and won after 1 week, so this sunday the regional government decided to lift the mandatory quarantine avoiding that all the others would also file complaints..."
"474 , Boris in an article in one of the Sundays said that he expects life to return to normal ( whatever normal will be in the future) by July.If that is the case the there cannot be any 14 day quarantine..There will be flights ( many fewer ) in July so everyone keep your fingers crossed that we do not see infections rise again in the UK."
"In addition to Ryan, EJ etc it seems that Jet 2 are now cancelling June flights.Report from those who have had their flights cancelled. ."
"Portugal Resident, quoting an interview the PM gave on TSF radio , Gyms, bars and discos may not be allowed to open this summer.Let's hope that something has been lost in translation."
"Ryanair have cancelled our flights for June 30th , but are taking bookings for July 1st , maybe that is the new start point ? Flights are a fair price as would be expected ."

I've been to Harry's bar In carvoeiro tonight. It's open. Not one person ordered food. So 'bars are not open' ?? Some are. Ps. I did get a sausage Sarney earlier in the day. It depends on the type of licence. Local GNR tolerance I suppose. Especially as 2 GNR were getting a kebab across the road when we left.
"Harry's Bar is a restaurant , it has a restaurant license., it serves food.Under previous names and ownership it has always served food, we had lunch there a few times.If it does not have a restaurant license it is a bar and according to the rules cannot open.."
"Terry, talking to Aaron and Sue last night they believe they come under 'the like' category. Again being Portugal is all about interpretation of the rules. Forca Portugal. X"
"So 'bars are not open' ?? Some are - as said it's all to the kind of license that they have, here the word ""bar"" (maybe because it's an anglicism, not a portuguese word) is not restricted to nightlife bars, you can use it and have a restaurant license... so the ones that will have issues are the nightlife bars. GNR is going to check only those.

"Certainly the 'bars' in Albufeira are not open, only some of those places that have a 'food licence' which you can use even if not ordering food.Bars and night clubs used mainly by British visitors and ex-pats remain closed and I am told possibly may not open unless and until the 'social distancing' laws are scrapped.Joella A - who are you asking?

AT how are you getting to Faro.
I'm driving from the UK.
Be careful. Spain has 14 day quarantine in place.
"Sorry, I ought to have said I'm delivering to the Portuguese armed forces. So have permits in place from all countries being transited.Will only be in a van so an easy journey, just glad the restaurants will be open."
Safe trip then. Be interested in hearing if you encounter any issues at all and whether there are border checks. Have fun in faro. Lots opening here in carvoeiro so you should be OK. Remember to bring some masks with you.
Not sure if the IDPs are required yet. Different ones required for Portugal and SpainI. I assume this has been taken into account by the relevant paperwork.
No new cases in Algarve last few days .... no new cases in Albufeira for 10 days ..
Not just we Brits waiting on airlines to confirm their programs.I have seen an article in the Irish independent about an Irish couple stuck in Portugal.Aer lingus despite still showing flights from 31st May has said that all flights to Faro are still cancelled indefinitely..
"Terry I have friends who are resident in Portugal and keep getting their flights cancelled back to Faro from the UK so still stuck there , Think their flight was with Easyjet."
Untrue about Aer lingus flights to faro from Dublin . Not confirmed yet. They are actively on the phone and their social media pages replying to people publicly and no mention of that. However on their website you cannot book June flights now - showing “sold out”. Irish independent - no one reads that here unless you’re a certain political alignment. A rag of a newspaper akin to the Sun in UK.
"JaylanWe have had two flights cancelled so rather than wait for a third, rescheduled others. When you now see sold out it usually means it is not going to fly.I sympathise with the airlines, until the politicians make up their minds when. Where and how we can travel all they can do is promote flights that may never happen."
"After 10 days clear, Albufeira has one new case today ... and hundreds are on the beaches, many swimming."
Swimming should be encouraged. Mineral rich sea water is good for the body and a swim is good for the soul.Enjoy your swim!
Beach isnt that busy from looking at the webcam. Cannot wait to get back out there as soon as is safe.

John - There's too much politics in the UK Government decision making. Different factions pulling in opposite directions. We were too late into lockdown because of it. People have died as a result.
You're right. One step at a time.
Police forces across the UK have already stated that they do not have the manpower to enforce the 14 day quarantine. Looks good on paper for uk gov tho.
"My June flight with Jet 2 has just been cancelled. I don't know why they are bothering with the quarantine now. Too little too late as usual and, as a few people have stated, it's a political decision! Will get to my apartment one day!"
"Quarantine takes effect from the 8th June and will be reviewed every three weeks.That means that the first review takes place just before the majority of flights restart.Anyone travelling in early July may or may not have to be quarantined.No details on any air bridges between the UK and countries with low infection rates,BBC news."
But the UK doesn't have low infection rates! The UK has completely messed up their corona virus response. What country would want to consider an air bridge with the UK ?
Yep. Might just book a one way flight!
Just found this from BBC News https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52781812…
"France threatened reciprocity some time ago when the UK withdrew the decision not to quarantine arrivals from France.Greece has included the UK in a list of countries with a "" high"" infection rate which prohibits British tourists in the first phase of Greece opening to tourists in JuneBBC World news this morning. Both Greece and Portugal have kept infection rates down by reacting early and enforcing stricter rules than the UK."
"I bet there are more people infected with other communicable diseases than the figures show for this particular variety, which is causing fear and panic across the world.Albufeira and Portugal should keep tourists away. For a very long time. It will cause terrible hardship and cost tens of thousands of jobs, probably bankrupt the country, but it's the only way to keep the infection rate down to a manageable 0.1% of the population. Allowing exemptions and exceptions is asking for trouble.Edited: 4:22 am, May 24, 2020 "
"Sorry Terence, Greece has done genuinely well ... 276 cases per million pop. Portugal, on the other hand, didn`t do that well, with almost 3000 cases per million ... that is more than France or Germany, around 80% of Italy and UK ... Great news for Ryanair .. anyone can fly from Faro to UK .. via Dublin .. and avoid quarantine."
"Agreed. The UK govt. is prepared to sacrifice lives in order to get Covid ""done"". I fear peak after peak of deaths if we relax too soon. France is being wise."
Sorry Pryman you are in a minority of one.Both Greece and Portugal have received global praise for the way they have dealt with the virus Faro is the airport that welcomes millions of tourists to the Algarve not Lisbon.

"Are gyms, bars and restaurants open in Portugal?Flights are running from Dublin to Lisbon every couple of days, my other half can fly from Germany and meet me in Portugal.Will we be allowed to enter (both EU citizens)?Will quarantine be legally enforced?Thanks"
"There is no quarantine in Portugal unless you are showing symptoms. If you develop symptoms during your stay you have to self isolate. It's our civic duty to do so.Restaurants are opening with restrictions on numbers, hygiene, masks, ect.Stand alone bars not open but snack bars are. Pools remain closed.Gyms. Talk in the press this morning is they MAY be able to open 1st June."
Thanks for the quick response Nikky :)Do you have an official link about lack of enforcement and border control?
There are no border controls at Lisbon airport. Faro is closed.You can't cross the border from Spain to Portugal without being a resident with a permanent address.I wouldn't call it lack of enforcement. The Portuguese government doesn't want to enforce it's nationals or residents to do anything which is why they ask for truth and doing the decent thing. If you are on Facebook look up safe communities Portugal. Lots of info there.
Have I read an article correctly that says flights from Brazil are ok to land in Portugal?
Yes William you have. God help us.
"Technically, Faro is open .. there just are no major flights... just small craft. Similarly, smaller airports are open with light aircraft in and out all the time .. Cascais is particularly busy. Here is what ANA have to say ..At ANA we are trying to minimize the impact of COVID-19 at the 10 airports we manage, prioritizing the safety of our workers and passengers.Our airports are in permanent contact with the authorities, complying with government guidelines, and our teams operate in accordance with the safety standards indicated by Portugal’s Directorate-General of Health (DGS). We have taken a set of measures in order to mitigate this threat. In view of this difficult moment, we urge our passengers to remain calm, guaranteeing, on our part, permanent surveillance and updated information. We emphasize the importance of reducing visits to airports to what is strictly necessary and only by passengers, in order to avoid crowds in the terminal.84th day of Portugal`s infection ... still only 361 cases in Algarve, 15 deaths ..Edited: 9:08 am, May 25, 2020 "
"Meant to quote the most general statistic ... Algarve has had an equivalent 800 cases per million people, compared to UK 3800 , Spain 6000 ... and Brazil 1700 ..."
Does anybody have an official link to the current Portugal government stance on Covid?Much appreciated.
There is a comprehensive daily statistical update at https:/…The official stance on the situation with the new laws and other special measures is at https://covid19.min-saude.pt/ only in Portuguese.Albufeira town council has its own page some of which is in English at https:/…pagina-de-informacao-sobre-o-covid-19 - this re-iterates the government's laws and adds some local measures and information.
"PS there have been no commercial flights at Faro airport for several weeks now. The noise of aircraft is now so rare that when I heard one yesterday I looked out of the window. It was an 'executive' jet coming in from I know not where.It's actually quite something to look at the flight radar sites and see skies almost empty of commercial passenger flights. Not just here but in Spain, France and Italy. Flight radar shows the morning Cascais to Portimão Sevenair flight heading down, trundling along, 37 minutes late, eta 0957. Look out of the window if you are down that way."
"No new cases in Algarve in yesterday`s `relatorio` ... and for the first time, no new cases in Ayrshire ... but it was a Sunday .. fingers crossed for the rest of the week."
So to confirm before I book my flight today;If I arrive first week of June (EU citizen) I will not be turned away and not have quarantine enforced on me?
Who is flying into Faro in the first week of June ?Or rather who can you rely on to fly into Faro on the first week of June.You can fly Dublin to Lisbon.
Who is flying into Faro in the first week of June ?Irishflagman!
Anyone able to answer the question? Will he be allowed in and will he have to quarantine? I think the answer is yes he can enter Portugal and I am sure he doesn’t have to self quarantine.
The ROI government travel advice is avoid all unnecessary travel. So you shouldn't be booking flights anyway.your travel insurance will be invalid. There is no quarantine in Portugal unless you have symptoms.
Is there any advantage in claiming my ROI citizenship? I guess the rules are the same either way. Probabably the ROI will still be non schengen due to the border with the UK being open.
"@AgentNikky the Irish government advice should be taken with a pinch of salt. Other “advice” from them is “hold firm”, “we’re all in this together” and other bullsh*t. As a citizen, I can assure you a lot of us will be flying this summer. And we are well within our rights to book flights actually. Define necessary and unnecessary ? Only the individual themselves can decide that."
"Chocolate,Are Aer lingus still flying to Faro on Sunday .?"
"The hotel Group NAU is planning to start reopening from monday.Hotels in Albufeira, Salgados , and Salema , golf courses , Salgados and Morgado.It is predicting no more than 20% occupancy during June limiting this to 75 % as the season progresses."
"As promised, a quick update on my recent trip to Faro.French police at Eurotunnel checked that I had completed the form for entry into France. My first overnight stop was just outside Bordeaux and I was 5 minutes away when I got stopped by the French police, showed them what was needed and on my way within a minute.Crossed into Spain near Hendaye/Irun, a few French and Spanish police/customs about checking mainly cars, so straight through no problems.Made it to my evening stop in Spain without any checks.Only had approx 180 miles to do Friday, so a nice easy drive to the Portuguese border, quite a queue of traffic in both directions and was apparently taking up to 90 minutes to get through as they were checking everything other than HGV's. Fortunately I had spoken to my contact in Faro and they arranged for an police escort to meet me, so down the outside lane and waved straight through.Once I'd delivered and all paperwork completed, they gave me a lift to my hotel in a police minibus (social distancing).Painless check-in, screens up etc. I arranged with them not to do any housekeeping until I left, other than me getting clean towels from reception, the used ones I put in the trolley. Hardly saw any other guests, apparently there were only 8 of us all weekend.Most of the places I normally use in Montenegro were open and social distancing was being followed by most, though there were a few blips. Fortunately they all serve food, so never a problem just having a nice cold sagres.No Idea what it was like in Faro itself, as I was happy enough to stay in Montenegro.Whilst it isn't somewhere that has lots of tourists at the best of times, it wasn't quite as busy as normal so even the locals are taking time to get used to going out socialising again."

"Oh lord. Brexit again. Have we not sufferred enough? Can't they just go away quietly and ""Get Bexit Done"" as they promised?"
TD securities say 1.15 and RBC capital markets say 1.09 . I guess just get some Euros when you feel its a good rate . 1.12 is certainly an improvement . As you say a lot will depend on the negotiations .
The dangers of easing travel too soon were confirmed with the latest case in the Algarve being a woman who travelled from the relatively virus free Algarve to Lisbon to meet friends celebrating the easing of restrictions.
I understand the wish to restart tourism both for us and Portugal. But there must be a risk in allowing thousands of people from such an infected country as Britain. I hope Portugal doesn't regret having us back.
We will be traveling to the Algarve in June 2020. Are the hotel swimming pools open?
Yes with restrictions on social distancing etc.
Not quite over yet ... several new Covid cases reported today in Albufeira ... and a couple more in Loule ..
Cases some of which can be traced to increased movement around the country.A situation which could get worse as not just the Portuguese come South for their holidays but tourists arrive from the rest of Europe.It is far from over yet.
Hello everyone!Is there any information when could Lisbon open for tourists from the EU? When I say open I mean no quarantine or any other bans and limitations.Thank you!
No restrictions on EU arrivals by air.
"mmmm, I'd be wary of travelling to Lisbon, more Covid infections & deaths in the city and surrounding areas than the Algarve. Apparently today's figures havn't been published as yet due to technical problems, lets hope when they are published there is an improvement."
Unfortunately .. a big jump in new cases today ... 7 more .. https:/…but it seems to be centred on Loule more than anywhere else ... they could pass Albufeira in the next week or so.
Louie is the camara so includes not just the city but many of the resorts closest to the west of Faro..
"Terry, thank you. However, can I check the accuracy of your information somewhere? It seems a bit too good to be true to enter Lisbon without any restrictions or bans."
There are no restriction on anyone arriving from the EU into Lisbon.What they can do when they get there is a different matter. The rise in cases in Lisbon a large city are focused in areas of social deprivation. Where the majority of visitors would not go. Its all in the Portuguese press.. People albeit a few are driving down to the Algarve having flown into Lisbon..
"I know someone flying wizz air from luton, uk, to Lisbon this evening and catching train to albufeira tomorrow"
"In Lisbon, unlike elsewhere, the big shopping malls remain closed in an attempt to keep things under control.It is hardly surprising that, living in a crowded city and after 12 weeks of near house arrest, people are going outside and mingling. But infection still accounts for less than 0.1% of the population as a whole. This is not the Black Death."
406000 dead worldwide and that is with lockdown. Thankfully most countries haven’t followed the USA and Brazil or we would be in the millions.
406k worldwide. Only if you believe China didn't cook the books.
"Well I only gave that amount as someone would have insisted the official fig is , but yes your right Nicky along with some of the other states . Even the uks official fig is 40000 but if you include related deaths it’s 63000 ."
"Many people have it without knowing - asymptomatic - but can pass it on.Many people probably carry all sorts of infections without really knowing. In addition, that tea towel by your kitchen sink probably rates high on the list.Meanwhile it is a nice sunny day here in Albufeira, if rather windy. The snack bar / café a couple of doors up from me has several customers sharing the outside tables with friends.The local council's website is not working at the moment, so I cannot get the official word on next steps to restore some form of normality here. There is still no word as to when or if nightlife bars, discos etc can re-open. The definition 'nightlife' unfortunately includes the places where old fools like me fondly remember, sitting muttering over our ale while watching the football, rugby or cricket.All pleasures that may be denied us for a long time."
2 cases in Lagoa resulted in the local court being closed and disinfected.3 contacts of those infected isolating at home. Portugal Resident
More Americans have died with Covid than died during WW1.Shocking numbers and a reminder to everyone to please stay safe and obey the regulations whether your having a staycation or travelling abroad this year.
"William B - No alarming comparisons please.The USA lost more military personnel in World War One to disease (63,114) than to combat (53,402), largely due to the influenza epidemic of 1918. The population of USA in 1918 was about 30% of what it is now, so in relative terms the numbers from 1918 are worse than they are now.620,000 Americans died in their civil war when the total population was only around 10% of what it is now."
Don’t shoot the messenger please Cubsur. It was reported yesterday in the UK.The point I was trying to make is don’t be complacent and obey the rules unlike what’s happening in America at the moment where the fight between those who mask and those that don’t is unreal.And still a huge number that believe that it’s “ just a flu”.
"Portugal Resident ;""Illegal party in Lagos: confirmed Covid-19 cases rise to 16 with two admitted to hospital""https:/…No time to be smug. It'll spread in the Algarve just like everywhere else once the season gets going. Drunk brits won't care about distancing, hand washing etc.The choice is money or lives. Portugal has made its choice."
"Pointless and confusing use of stats is not helpful.30,000 people died in the London Blitz.2,977 died in the twin towers. Does that make Americans less devastated by their loss of life? Probably not.Cubsur, a stat. worth examining is % excess deaths (both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19) registered in 2020 compared with average deaths in 2015-19. That shows the real cost in lives."
"We will know next week if in response to demands from the airlines, holiday and leisure industries the Portuguese government relaxes the current regulations.Judging that thev risk to the economy being greater than the risk from the virus.As they keep saying, the lockdown can always be reimposed if the infection rate rises again...."

BBC News - Flu virus with 'pandemic potential' found in Chinahttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53218704Just when we thought things were improving!
Re-infection of Albufeira sees 40 new cases in two weeks ... and around 150 new cases in Algarve in the same period ... not good. This rate is far higher than the original infection over three months ...
618.An inevitable result of easing regulations..
Could be due to continued testing
"Either you have the virus or you to not.Testing means that you have been diagnosed before it could turn serious, you have to isolate before infecting others.More testing is a good thing.."
Keeping restrictions in place and minimising travel for at least another month would be good.
"328 new cases 8 deaths, up from yesterday.Not what Portugal needs if it wants to be on the no quarantine list."
"This is going to be a numbers game!! Lockdowns, restrictions, travel bans over 1 million cases per week current trend, what by end of July?? Attractions open, bars, Restaurants, Planes packed, Trumpy buying up all the medicine supplies around the world, this is going to be full circle.... all I want is my refund from Ryanair aghhh....."
"Before all this, there were plenty of other ways to get ill and die. The numbers still represent less than 1% of the population. It will never go away completely, so either we live in fear and confinement for the rest of our lives, or face up the fact that it might get us. And even if it does, there is a 98% recovery rate across almost age groups. I am happy with those odds. I do appreciate others might not be.Algarve region numbers : population, 440,000 confirmed cases in the 3 months : 639. Deaths : 15 - there have been none for about 8 weeks. Around a quarter of the cases resulted from three specific illegal events, that party and two cases of migrant workers being forced to live in insanitary and overcrowded conditions.There were plenty of Spanish and German voices to be heard around town today. They and their governments are apparently not worried about being here."
"Before all this, there were plenty of other ways to get ill and die.... yes but they were not called a pandemic, the illegal party you talk about was linked to 111 cases so how much after the two month summer party everyone is getting ready for??? I want a holiday the same as everyone else but this is to soon... p.s recovery rates were good because hospitals have worked hard for that while people are awaiting other treaments that got put on hold"
"There still is plenty of other ways to die.As long as those that are happy with the odds and are willing to take there chances observe the rules and mask up, social distance etc so as not to compromise the efforts for those who are a bit more cautious."
"At this stage, I'm inclined to go along with the ""plenty of other ways to die"" perspective.My wife and I have already postponed two planned trips to the Algarve this year and feel pressured into cancelling our planned visit from July 12th To July 26th. If we decide to travel, are we being irresponsible?Edited: 3:28 pm, July 02, 2020 "
Paul. I'm in 2 minds. The algarve is desperate for visitors. I'm seeing my friends running bars and restaurants really struggling. We need the financial input. But on the other hand we don't need a surge in cases. It's a tough call. Personally if you feel comfortable and happy to abide by the laws here then no I don't think it's irresponsible.
"Hi Paul. No you are not being irresponsible. All of us who live in tourist destinations are already well aware that whether home grown, or imported, this virus is coming back. Unless the human race goes into permanent lock down it will spread. The best all of us can now hope for is a slower spread so that health services are not over whelmed and then a vaccine."
It is important to remember that the `low deaths` figures in Portugal lulled a lot of people into a false sense of security ... perhaps the Costa government too... and high infection rates were `overlooked`.. But people who are much more susceptible to death from Corona virus are piling in from northern europe. If Costa cant stop northerners coming down to Algarve .. then I hate to say foreigners should maybe stay away ...
If say big Archie(and lads) from Scotland has mild symptoms 4 days into his hols!! does he(A) keep quiet and get on with it (B) doesn't fancy being stuck there and books 1st flight home still keeping quiet (C) get a test and then self isolate in the hotel for two weeks(hotel prob kick him out) and friends.... answers on a postcard
"It will take just one case in one hotel here to send everyone into a panic. It's a risk the Portuguese are willing to take to avoid the economic disaster should the tourist industry end . Are you willing to join that scenario? Or will you just stay indoors forever and hope it goes away?Your decision, unless governments make it for you."
"John C,Was big Archie sitting beside wee Jojo from Ireland on the flight out?"
Hi Steph. I’m looking at the FCO gov travel site and there is no change that I can see yet. It is still advising against travel. Sounds like yet another muddle!
"For the U.K. they have removed the “return from the U.K.” and updated the Covid partAlso the entry requirementsIt’s below the non essential travel partEdited: 4:36 am, July 03, 2020 "
"However, Telegraph Travel has noticed that the FCO has been tinkering its advice to 56 destinations, with the latest update reading: ""Editorial review to remove ‘Return to the UK’ section and improve ‘Coronavirus’ section"", the countries with this alert include:Latvia, San Marino, Poland, Austria, Norway, Italy, Hungary, Turkey, Switzerland, Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Cyprus, Malta, Iceland, Slovakia, Serbia, Germany, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Reunion, Australia, Finland, St Pierre and Miquelon, Andorra, New Zealand, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Gibraltar, Spain, Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Martinique, Monaco, St Lucia, Canada, Wallis and Futuna, Trinidad and Tobago, Montenegro, Bermuda, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei, French Polynesia, Denmark, Belgium, Estonia, France, Malaysia, Ireland, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Portugal."

The FCO pages have been updated but the advice is still the same. Click on Coronavirus on the main page then scroll down to returning to the UK and click on rules on entering the UK. Click on England and all the information is there about self isolating on your return
After 4 months and 122 daily Covid-19 reports from Portugal`s DGS ... todays report has not appeared over 3 hours late ..
What can be the issue that's delaying it.
now that Portugal is not on the list- what happens now to holidays and flights????
"Breaking news Portugal is NOT on the quarantine free list. BBC.Edited: 10:22 am, July 03, 2020 "
DamnSo one of the European countries with the least deaths and doesn’t make the cut??MmmmmmmAnyone would think Leicester wasn’t locked down this week and we’re a beacon of light
Nothing to do with death rate but current infection rates..Portugals has increased significantly in recent weeks.
"So have some specific regions in Spain, but it's still safe to go to Ibiza despite a sudden rise in cases due to yet another party."
"Ok TerryYou carry on isolating and believing everything with regards to the virus that you’re toldEveryone has a different opinion, but if Portugal are open to us I’d gladly fly."
"Surely you can't have an opinion on facts. A fact is a fact, is it not?"
"You can have an opinion on anything?The facts are Portugal misses the list, you can still fly, you’re advised to isolate for 14 days when you get back,but still allowed out for shopping and medical requirements, that about right?Shame some posters think only what they think matters, and belittle others, for what it’s worth I’m easy with either way of looking at it. Understand why some people are scared, but I’m. It one of them Enjoy whatever you do and good luck"
"Chippee, fantastic place Torquay. Had many a good night at the Hideaway.Qualityspy, have just been sent some pics from Ibiza from a friend who flew out on Wednesday. It looks as tho good times are being had in typical who cares fashion."
WilliamYes a beautiful place to liveHideaway?? That was a while back ;)
First visit was 1988 chippee
"I only moved down in 1997 , hideaway closed late 90s early 2000s from what I remember Be interesting to see what happens regards Portugal. I have a feeling it will make the next list, whenever that may be, too late for some no doubt which will be a shame. And if the airline don’t cancel the flight Then money will be lost. Mine was booked last year so will see what happensWhat a palaver:/"
