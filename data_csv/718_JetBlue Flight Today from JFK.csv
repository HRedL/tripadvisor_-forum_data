"The first flight from the US under the high-risk quarantine protocol arrived today. Based on the seat map on Friday there should be over 100 passengers. If anyone has any information on their immigration experience, please provide. How long does it take to get test results back upon arrival in Barbados?Will the Ministry of Health continue to hide the number of people detained in quarantine?On Friday, the Asst Sec of HHS testified to Congress that the (envy of the world) US testing program will not meet a benchmark of 2 to 3 days test results anytime soon. So I expect a lot of travelers will not have test results."
Detained?
"#1 Detained is in fact the correct word and used internationally in these circumstances (assuming you are not free to leave, you are detained). btw It has been announced now that there are 17 people at Harrisons Point from this evening. It was unfortunate that the government refused to be open or transparent about numbers a week or so ago, but hopefully they have learned that that kind of behaviour is counterproductive."
"And indeed Capt Dennis, you are right, the US program of testing is the biggest in the world (the biggest that can be verified, but not as a % of the population), and if they cannot guarantee 72 hour turnaround there are very few that can. Alas I do not have clients on this flight but did put some feelers out so if I hear anything..."
What do you mean about not being open and transparent a week ago. The number in isolation is published. I assume it's now jumped to 17 because of people coming in on the Jetblue flight as it was 7 this morning. It's all well being critical on how it's being handled and using words like detained - but I am not sure what else you expect them to do - if people are positive then they will be isolated and that should not come as any surprise.
I have just read about the 12 additional cases.. 9 nurses with positive test results - I am struggling to understand that one.
"I'd like to know how that flight went. Are they quarantining ALL US passengers for 7 days? I ask b/c I'm supposed to fly out for a funeral, staying on 6 days, but if they're quarantining everyone for 7 days, I unfortunately will cancel."
"#5 yodacat - it is difficult indeed to get your head around this business - were the Ghanaians tested before coming here? The country has tested far fewer people per thousand than Barbados, for example. In any event, not one of those nurses are able to work of course. Where will they all be staying in isolation/quarantine (or whatever term the government decides to use)? When a returning national tested positive a week or so ago, the govt detained those sat close to them in a disease centre even though they had negative tests and were not connected to the operson who tested positive. Will that happen with these nurses? One hopes the government will clarify very quickly the truth rather than a PR version of it."
"If you look at the FAQ’s in the Protocol Web Site on Visit Barbados , you will see that ALL passengers arriving from a high risk country , ie America , carrying a negative test will be put in Quarantine in a Government approved Hotel ( which are also listed ) at their own expense , or in a Government facility for free .  This will be for 7 days when they will then be tested a second time . If still negative , they may then continue their holiday .  However I believe they reserve the right to keep you longer as one Bajan American was tested positive after a third test at 11 days the other week . It seems I must point out , yet again , that ONLY those with a positive test are sent to the Covid 19 Specialist Hospital at Harrison’s Point . No one else !Edited: 10:09 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"In the US, and I believe in Canada and Britain also, many if not most people who test positive stay in isolation at home. Only people who need treatment that must be managed in a hospital go to a hospital. It seems extreme that anyone who tests positive must isolate at Harrison point."
"Do you know for certain that it's only negative test holders? The wording is weird. It sounds like all passengers from high risk countries are quarantined at ""satellite hotels"" (crane or hilton) for 7 days. I'm only trying to figure out if coming for a few days (for a funeral) is OK. I'm not getting a straight answer from anyone."
"Yes of course it’s only Negative test holders , if you have no test and are found to be Positive when tested on arrival , you will be taken straight to Harrison’s Point Hospital to be isolated and treated until you are better. If you come here less than 7 days before the funeral , you will not be able to attend it unfortunately.Edited: 11:47 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"Verona , I think if Positive testers were allowed to isolate at home , it would mean that Barbados could quickly end up in the same state as America ."
"If Barbados has people coming in from other countries whether they be considered high medium or low, you are very quickly going to run out of space at Harrison Point if you try to keep anyone who tests positive there. This policy will change by September. One negative test within 3 days is okay to a point but it is not going to keep the virus off the island. And all these people self quarantined are not going to be reporting that they have a fever. I am not suggesting what should be done I am saying that the current plan is not sustainable."
"Westie ...so true (again!!)"""""" it would mean that Barbados could quickly end up in the same state as America """"""or the UK for that matter. All sorts of questions being asked about how the Government handled the situation from February on..... including whether isolation at home for infected people was the correct policy. Impossible to see an alternative but there are some who believe that many with very mild symptoms may not have stayed in isolation at home Difficult to believe this is true but given the behaviour of some over the period since lockdown was eased I am not surprised at all A member of SAGE has suggested that infected people should be given free shelter to break the cycle of infection in homes The lack of social distancing in pubs/bars/restaurants is a joke and the pictures of beaches in the south of England on Friday were ,again , beyond belief .... do we not learn !!!Went to collect a takeaway last night from a restaurant that is now open ...4 young members of staff all behind the bar together .... less than 18"" apart ...even touched each other !!!!.... and serious questions now being asked asked as why hairdressers can work with just a visor and no mask ....whereas medical must wear a mask if using a visor"
".#14My hairdresser wears a visor that covers from her from ear to ear and from forehead to below her chin (she’s put a string of diamanté along the top rim and looks rather swish!). She also wears a disposable apron, And, of course, she’s always behind me. I have to sanitise my hands and wrists at the door and wear a face mask the whole time, inc when being shampooed, plus a neck to floor disposable gown that has a hole for my head but is torn off of me on completion. She has only one employee now (the Beauty Salon side is closed) and their stations are a good 8’ apart. There is a 15-minute gap between clients for complete sanitation of anything I’ve been near. Only the one client each allowed in the salon at any one time. I wait in the car and she WhatsApps when she’s ready for me to enter.We have to sign our name, address and phone number after each visit in case we have to be contacted should a client of the same day be found later to have the virus.No cash. No coffee. No water. No magazines.I don’t think she can do more and I feel safe. I didn’t know that medics had to wear a mask with a visor but can appreciate that it would be a good idea in a hospital situation as you can’t be too careful because of the lower immunity of patients, breathing problems, open wounds etc.."
Verona - I can't believe you think it's extreme that positive cases have to be isolated at Harrisons point. How do you think we can try to stop the spread if we don't isolate cases from everyone else. If this thing gets out into the population with community spread then god help us because I don't think you quite understand how limited our health care is in terms of dealing with that sort of crisis.
"Hi Verona You said “ All those people Quarantine are not going to report a fever “  Well with the Ministry visiting them daily for their twice daily temperature checks , how are they going to do that ? Also , quite honestly why would they do that? If I thought I had the virus I would be on the phone like a shot . Are people really so brainless ? They are in Government approved Hotels and not allowed out Don’t you realise that ?Edited: 6:49 am, August 02, 2020 "
"In case you doubt the fact that visitors from high risk countries quarantining in Government approved Hotels are not allowed out , I can attest to that . The hotel next to me was made one for a short time and those quarantined there could not use the pool , or leave the boundaries of their room and patio , not even for meals and they had visits from the Ministry daily . It’s a huge undertaking for a hotel and we should congratulate the staff at the Crane , the Hilton and the one at Worthing for they are truly also in the front line ."
BB .... yes all those things you mention have been experienced by myself and my wife The point being made in the article in the Sunday Telegraph today is that the visor on its own does not give sufficient protection ..which is why medical staff have to use bothThe logic seems to be that the visor produces a downwards 'plume' of air / breathe that ends up on top of the customer ...they cannot be behind you all the time ..especially if you have short hairOn my first visit I was a little surprised there were no masks but I was advised it is not mandatory for them to be worn No doubt the 'review' will produce an answer !!!Still probably a lot safer than the pub garden or the beach !!!
"Yodacat, The lack of transparency concerns the travelers who have tested negative that are then detained in quarantine. The status report only reflects positive cases which are in isolation. Just as the status report shows new isolation cases and new recoveries, it should show new quarantine cases and releases from quarantine.The JetBlue flight on 7/25 had a Bajan American who tested positive on arrival. There was also a positive case on the 7/30 AC flight. Per the protocols, for any risk country, passengers sitting in close proximity will be quarantined. The number of these cases is not reported.If one arrives from the US with a negative test, you are quarantined through the 7th day from your test date, so at least for 4 days, and then the 1-2 days for test results. If one arrives without a test and is then tested upon arrival with negative result, are you free after just maybe 1-2 days in quarantine?"
"Capt Dennis... I am not sure why we need a running total of people in quarantine and I think it's quite clear that if you come into contact with a positive case that you will be required to quarantine. If you are going to travel during a pandemic, surely you have to accept all the risks that go with it."

"They may let you out of Quarantine after 5 to 6 days as you say, but an American was tested again for a third time and tested positive at 11 days, so it seems there is no guarantee.Edited: 8:46 am, August 02, 2020 "
What's s bit scary to me is that passengers who come in from the US- negative test results or not will be quarantined for 7 days. Correct? I then would presume a lot would not bother to go through the difficult process of getting one and just test upon arriving in Barbados. I cant imagine there will be many people on these flights who understand the quarantine protocol but still..all those people walking into an airport and taking a flight not tested. Another example of the need for pre flight testing.
