"tapash1989Evert hing is shut down until 14th April, please wait until office open to get refund."
Better is to wait you will either get refund or a credit note
it will delay because of Covid-19
Did you receive a reply. Even I had booked for May 2020. No refund received yet
My booking was on 29.03.20 but cancelled due to corona outbreak now am waiting for the response. No one take calls.
May be all the offices are closed at present. You can try your luck once safari booking starts.
"Hi, I am going through the same. I had also booked the corbett safari and I haven't received any refund as well. Did you get any further information on it?"
