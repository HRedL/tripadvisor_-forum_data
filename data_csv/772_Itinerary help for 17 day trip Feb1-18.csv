"I would like to figure out the best itinerary that will show the highlights of japan but also get us into the winter festivities. I have been to japan several times already but I am bringing my parents this time, who are in their mid sixties. My hope was to figure out an itinerary that left us several days (4-5) in each location. Tokyo, Sapporo (during the snow festival), kyoto, and hakuba. These destinations were my hope as I would love to snowboard but have heard that hokkaido is more westernized and expensive, compared to the hakuba valley area. As it will be my parents only time in japan I was hoping to show them a more authentic location for skiing. If anyone has any idea how I can make this work I would be so happy! Money isn't really an issue. I just don't want to have a lot of travel time for my parents. Thanks in advance for any help!"
"Welcome to the TA forums.https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2400.html - suggested itineraries. Without knowing your arrival and departure airports, we can't give you too much advice."
"Since the dates are fixed, I would schedule everything around the Sapporo Snow Festival.To save travel time, I would schedule my trip to avoid backtracking as much as possible. E.g. A direct flight to Sapporo, then fly to Kyoto (Osaka), then shinkansen to Tokyo, then depart for home. Or rearrange your cities as necessary."
"I have tickets from Haneda Airport both flying in and flying out! I realized after the fact that I was going along the same time period as the Snow festival. The trip is more about the skiing and snowboarding as that is our hobby, but I have always thought that the snow sculpting festival looked awesome and would really like to fit in into my schedule if at all possible"
"Try to book lodgings for the Snow Festival 3 months in advance. Most years it sells out.Northern Japan has no shortage of good ski areas. Niseko in Hokkaido is extremely westernized and probably best avoided if you want to save money or don't like rowdy Australians. The resort is nice though. However there are many Ski areas in Hokkaido and I would think anywhere that's a bit less known would be more in line with what you are looking for. Furano is one I hear good things about but I haven't had the chance to go yet so can't comment on it. . I've heard good things about Hakuba but I can't say much as I've not been. As for places easily accessible from Tokyo I can recommend, I really like Joetsu International Ski area in Niigata prefecture, it's quite large and right off the Shinkansen line. But it can get really crowded especially on the easier slopes. Fukushima prefecture also has a lot of good places to ski, but they can be a bit more difficult to access due to distance from the Shinkansen. Zao in Miyagi Prefecture is another good spot for the scenery but the terrain isn't anything particularly interesting and there are a lot of flat bits so it's no so good for borders. Another place that has piqued my interest is Appi Kogen in Iwate prefecture. Seems to have one of the longest runs in the country. I'll probably try to go there next season assuming the weather cooperates. It's a bit far from any big cities though it seems pretty easy to access as it's close to the Shinkansen and highway."
">>> The trip is more about the skiing and snowboarding as that is our hobby, but I have always thought that the snow sculpting festival looked awesome and would really like to fit in into my schedule if at all possible <<<From personal experience the sculptures in Sapporo are amazing and something you'll remember forever. There are also other winter festivals in the vicinity of Sapporo. Asahikawa, Otaru, and Lake Shikotsu (and a few others) have festivals that are well worth attending, especially if you are already in Sapporo."
"I suggest starting your trip in Hokkaido and go skiing. On a ski slope, the main goal is to get a good ski experience with quality snow at a good resort. Niseko and some other slopes at Hokkaido meet that criteria. Niseko also offers good English support overall. Start your first week skiing there and then head to see Sapporo and Otaru. From Sapporo, you can choose to fly down to Kyoto and take the train to Tokyo (which has more international flights). Alternatively, you can also see a bit more of Hokkaido by taking the train to Hakodate and then Shinkansen to Tokyo. With just 18 days and allowing a week for Sapporo and Hokkaido, if you want your parents to see Tokyo and Kyoto, I suggest flying.If Hokkaido is not a must, you can of course go to ski at Hakuba or other ski slopes closer to Tokyo instead."

Money isn't really an issue. I just don't want to have a lot of travel time for my parents.Niseko and other ski resorts mentioned are all authentic for skiing, though in the last few years there are many more foreigners staying there, alongside many more western style apartments, restaurants, bars etc. As money is not an issue in your case, I'd also recommend Niseko for less travelling than to Hakuba (via Tokyo). Though beware that lines (for ski lifts/gondola) might be long so avoid weekends if possible - after the Sapporo Snow festival. From Sapporo/CTS, take direct domestic flight to Osaka/ITM to commence sightseeing in Kyoto and subsequently back to Tokyo as mentioned by Sammy.If you're all intermediate/advanced skiers/snowboarders, then Niseko, Hakuba, Shiga Kogen have plenty of good runs to enjoy for at least 4 days.Edited: 1:33 am, May 21, 2020 "
I strongly doubt if the Sapporo Snow Festival will be held next year.Hokkaido is suffering from the second wave of COVID-19 now.
"@Shot-sensei,hv skied in Niseko 4 times vs 7 in Hakuba - powder snow is indifferent during peak season (Jan to early March) in both. Indeed, the views of the 3 summits of snowy Shirouma-dake at nearly 3000m is sth we always yearn for from the top of Happo-one @1850m on clearly days.ONe of my skis in Hakuba with such views.japantravelinsights.com/jp-ski-hakuba-2017-jâ€¦"
">>Am now itching to go, can't wait! Ah ! no idea when I could hit the runs on Hakuba again after my last ski trip in Feb was cancelled. Hopefully in next Jan/Feb if all travel restrictions have been lifted. I did use that videocam to take videos in the past though in the last 2 ski trips I have not. Maybe too lazy to edit afterwards."
thank you all for the wonderful advice! for my first time posting something I am astonished at how many people gave me input. gotta love it!
