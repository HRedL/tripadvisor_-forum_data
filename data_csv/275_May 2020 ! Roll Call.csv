"05/16/2020 - 05/24/2020. Room 424. Taking advantage of the non-stop United flights, EWR - EYW and back. More expensive but much more convenient. Pjk"
Just booked yesterday! May 7 to May 14 staying at shipyard condos for the fourth time. Does anybody have any info on the dates for the 2020 singer songwriters festival?
May 22-25 for Memorial weekend.
May 31 to June 5 - our 45th wedding anniversary!

Nothing officially booked yet but I will be going for my fourth straight Songwriters Festival!
Booked May 12-20. Can’t wait
Usually go early December and Mid May. As KW is getting so expensive I'm trying NOLA this December. Will probably book KW soon after for May.
56 days till we arrive for our 5th trip and 2nd SWF! Who else will be there same time?
"May 17 - 24 for our annual week 20 at Hyatt Sunset Harbor. May cannot get here soon enough. I did see there is a BBQ, Bourbon and Blues festival during our week. This is the first I remember seeing such an event, have they done one before or is this a first time event?"
There's some information in here ---> https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g34345…Pjk

Has anyone else thought of canceling/postponing? Not sure what to do. Guess decide in two weeks? If I do has anyone been down in the month of November?
"Planned 10-15, waiting another 2 weeks to decide. Delta now free cancellation.Edited: 7:01 pm, March 22, 2020 "
Was going down 12-20. Will decide in two weeks. Hope things will get better.
We just moved from next week to the last week in May. I’m guessing it’s a crapshoot at this point as things seem to be changing daily. If we can’t go in May we are looking at November
Who is still planning on going and who is canceling due to covid-19
"I’d still love to go in May, but the way things are going it’s not looking to good. Who knows how long Key West will be closed to visitors. If they aren’t ready I’m thinking of rescheduling in November"
"Just read the state of emergency in Florida expires May 9, at that point they will decide to extend it or not"
"We are not making any plans until this crisis is over, we have canceled all of our travel through June."
I'm certainly not cancelling anything just yet. Too busy cancelling 7 days in Rennes then seven more in Paris in April. a trip that was completely rescheduled from this past Christmas and New Years.sheesh!Pjk
We have cancelled thru may but not June yet.
I just got off the phone with the inn I’m booked at. They told me to play it by ear. If I need to rebook they will waive the fees and hold on to my deposit. So you’re thinking Key West is going to be closed through May? Hope we all get through this and everyone in Key West stays healthy
"Czarjets, I was commenting on my personal travel plans for April and May but I wouldn’t be surprised if the county closes to tourists thru may. We are just at the tip of the iceberg here, more positives coming as the tests become available. We closed waaaay too late."
I agree Florida should have closed down sooner and kicked out the spring breakers. I have friends that live in Cape Coral and they were angry that Florida didn’t shut down sooner. I hope everyone stays well and when this is over will be down :)
I just booked for early November. With the flight restrictions and everything else going on wanted to be safe. I still have my May reservation just in case but I told the inn if we don’t go down they can keep it. I feel bad for the people in Key West.
We have cancelled our Hawaii travel plans for April. Our next scheduled trip is for the end of June in KW. We'll see if that happens. We now have to reschedule something for later this year - I'm thinking sometime in August or September. It's looking like we will have flight credits to use by October unless our flight scheduled for next week is actually cancelled by the airline.
I feel your pain cruisemom. We were supposed to be leaving for Japan in a week. Instead I am debating the safest way to make it down to Flagler Beach where my wife is snowbirding.
"Good luck Cruisemom, hope by June this is sorted out and you can go:)"
Anyone else rebooked for November ? Hope all of us May people can get down sometime this year. Stay healthy everyone
"We have canceled all of our travel plans until Thanksgiving, but now we are thinking of going down to Key West the beginning of November, we shall see what happens !"
It'll have to wait until sometime next year. If I get away this year it will be either Paris and Rennes or Prague and Budapest. Both if I can swing it but both depend on particular dates.Pjk
Bottomtime that’s when I rebooked. Good luck. Hope your travel works out for you pjk
I’m waiting until the last minute to change dates again to see what happens. May 25-May 31st. If rescheduling again think will try January!
"Yeah. I haven't yet cancelled anything . The hotel holds a room forme without a deposit so the only thing I'd need to do is cancel the flight, and United has already indicated that they are giving refunds.Pjk"
"We canceled three trips from Easter until October, we were refunded the money for all three trips from the airlines. We have one trip in November and one at Christmas, both qualify for refunds from the airlines if we decide not to go."
Some of my hotels have to be canceled by May 19th. I'll hold until then I guess.
"Kristyn - is November out for you? We had already planned another trip at Thanksgiving so we’re keeping that. If May falls through, and then June is a no-go, I think we’ll end up building on that November trip and bulking it up to 10 days or more. Right now we have a condo in Truman, but we may add a few nights up to Islamorada too!"
"Love to travel- November is power boat races I think the 8th-12th which I want to avoid, and we don’t want to be close to Thanksgiving. Our KW place is filling up for the type of room we want there so pretty limited for dates-which is why we may look at January instead. Still unsure but that’s the direction we are heading. Just waiting now...."
I'm hearing the beaches in Jacksonville FL will be opening starting tonight.
I think Jax opened beaches for limited times morning and evening for exercise. Groups of peeps and laying out isn’t allowed currently.
