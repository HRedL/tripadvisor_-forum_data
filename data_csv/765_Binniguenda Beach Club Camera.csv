"As we all deal with the Covid 19 pandemic, my wife and i have cancelled an upcoming UK trip and now we're hoping for a vaccine so we can book our annual visit to the Binni right after Christmas. In the meantime my wife logs on daily (or more...) to check the camera that shows real time on the beach in front of the club with the pool above and she noted this morning that there were two signs of a big runoff of water onto the beach, one off to the left towards the lobster restaurant and one about in line with the stairs going to the temporary beach club bar. Anyone know what happened to cause this? Stay safe. Bruce"
"Hi Bruce.We have had pounding surf at Playa Chahue for most of the afternoon. Quite relaxing given the solitude. Remember, there has been a rather FULL moon for the past two nights, probably pulling the sea higher.Sorry to hear about your change of travel plans, though, “change” is the way of all component things.Be safe, be well......CH"
"Bruce you were correct in seeing the water running from the new beach club webcam. The infinity pool has been filled, seen pics from the pool looking back towards the pier, looks fantastic. Went and watched the all day version and you can see a fair amount of water running towards the ocean."
So the beach club may be completed?
"No, but it should be close."
Hi Bill.Are you here in Huatulco?CH
"Casa, no would love to be there,but have many contacts in Huatulco."
"That's a nice photo Mike, but i'm thinking that's another Niru Hotel or an artist's rendering as the topography looks far different than that the Santa Cruz location of the Binni's Beach Club. We took numerous walk 'rounds during our January stay this year and i agree with others that it will look fabulous when completed. 'Just hope it doesn't change the culture of the Binni that many of us returning clients have long enjoyed over the years! Stay safe. Bruce"
If anyone has access to Huatulco drone's facebook page there is a nice view of Santa Cruz and includes the new beach club under construction on left of photo. Posted May 6th.
Thanks Bruce.CH
Thanks Bill. Love those drone photos and videos.CH
We can dream and hope.
I found this drone vid today.. filmed by Dave Hiebert - https://www.youtube.com/watch…
"Lovely, Suze, thank you!CH"
You are most welcome.. I thought of you both when I saw it!
"Too bad they blocked your link to the website, but we sure appreciate you following up and your description of the pool & beach club. The pool was all poured when we were there but they hadn't started tiling yet. Thank-you for all your efforts! Stay safe. Bruce"

"Thank-you so much for sharing that Suze. We chartered a boat & skipper to do some sightseeing on our last visit to Santa Cruz and 'were grateful to see the dolphins & whales in abundance. Of course it's not ""Disneyland"" so you never know what you'll see! Stay safe, Bruce"
Is there a link where we can see this camera?????
Here's the link but the camera isn't working these days due to COVID-19 issues. https:/…webcam-huatulco-santa-cruz-playa
If you ho to ToDo Huatulco's facebook page there is a short video from the new beach club pool.
Could someone give me the web address for the camera? Thanks!
It's not working!
"As per my post from a week ago, no it's not working and won't be until further notice. The webcam doesn't have electricity because the COVID-19 lock down in Huatulco is still in place and fixing things like webcams aren't a big priority.Edited: 1:54 pm, May 31, 2020 "
