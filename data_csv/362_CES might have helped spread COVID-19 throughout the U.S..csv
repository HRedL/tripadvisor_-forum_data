Just putting this out there. https:/…
"Interesting. I was there one week after the conference, and remember feeling a little sick when I got back home. Nothing serious though. I'd be interested in an antibody test."
Sooner or later Vegas was going to be blamed.
I’m sure Trump knew about this ahead of time and let it happen anyway...
"@TheSalesGuy, that's okay. After all, Florida gets blamed for pretty much everything else!"
"I was in Las Vegas in Dec., Jan., Feb., and March. Also in NYC twice in Feb. plus New Orleans. Seattle. All hot spots AFTER I LEFT. I am fine, but I suspect I may had it but no symptoms. My nephew’s girlfriend, 20ish, had a very bad flu November 2019, she fully recovered; all the symptoms were exactly same as Covid19. This was in Northern California, no foreign travel. This is someone I know.It is too early to say when and where Coronavirus started, or did it start from one area or many areas simultaneously? There have been many similar November and December cases in the US and Europe too."
"So it was Mac. Now, we are getting somewhere."

"I agree that this was here in November. I think I got sick at the Ritz Carlton in Tysons Corner in December. Checked in and saw a used Kleenex on the ottoman. Bellman removed it but didn't disinfect it. Guessing the person who had the room before us was sick. Tysons for those who don't know has the fancy mall for the Northern VA and DC area, so lots of tourists, international ones too. Got sick two days later. Heard a few stories of people being ill in November and it wasn't the flu. If it was around here in November, that means the studies being done, including the recent one from USC which stated that there is 28-55 times the number of people with antibodies than expected makes sense. It also tracks with what I have been saying that while the infection rate is high, the death rate is much closer to the seasonal flu. Now that doesn't remove blame from anyone. China tried to cover it up, just like they did the bird flu in 2006. They tried to spread fear through those texts that said the ports were going to be shut down, etc. The WHO was complicit with China, still is. The White House should have issued a travel ban from China much sooner, should have been coordinating with states sooner re equipment for this, and should have consistent messaging. Finally, the media and the political parties are to blame. The media for whipping people up into a hysteria with falsehoods and half truths, and the political parties for thinking only of their priorities vs actually helping the people they are supposed to serve."
Don't go to Mac for your macover.
"""Now that doesn't remove blame from anyone.""Including the arrogant prikc who won't wear a mask during a pandemic because it's an unbearable infringement on his freedoms."
"So if someone gets infected in Las Vegas, but then goes back to Ohio and dies there, do Las Vegas and Ohio both get 1/2 credit?No wonder the mayor wants the casinos to open. Those who contract the virus in Las Vegas probably won't die there. Or even be a burden on the LV medical system.Edited: 1:26 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"KT, the fatality is from where the person lives. Not where the died of got it from."
"PnS, didn't you say you were having an antibody test a few days ago? Just wondering what the outcome was for you?"
“ the fatality is from where the person lives. Not where the died of got it from.”Deaths are recorded in the jurisdiction where it takes place. Your survivors will have a Nevada death certificate if that’s where you’re declared dead. Even if you live in Wyoming.
"@JamI tried. When I got to the place, which was a 80 mile round trip btw, they said they were out of antibody tests. Apparently they are back in stock, looks like a better version. Price is now $125 vs $75. My wife said her company should have their validations done shortly. I'll just wait and get it from them. Our blood tests have always been free, so $250 saved plus gas and time. Plus I trust these people."
"PnS, thanks for that. Appreciated."
"Irishfan is correct re: what state ""counts"" the death."
"Are you sure about that? That is not what is being said out here. Case in point was a young male who worked in a pharmacy. He lived in San Diego and died in Riverside, the death is counted in San Diego’s Covid numbers not riverside."
"@SwearingenI don't like to wear masks for a few reasons. 1.) They are hard to breathe in. 2.) Notice how many times people touch them to adjust them, pull them up/down? This infects their hands which they then use to touch things. Considering a surgical mask only has a 56% protection rate from inhalation/exhalation of viral spray, you are turning that into a 100% chance of infecting another surface. You are also touching your face more which is the worst thing to be doing. That is why for decades the CDC said to not wear masks. The WHO still says not to. 3.) Masks are being forced on people to provoke reactions of fear. Seeing people in masks, gloves, chem suits only reinforces people's worry. If this was around in November, and was as bad as it is claimed, the infection rate and number of deaths would have been massive. Hospitals would have been overwhelmed months ago."
"I am a salesman, so when I travel all over the country and in foreign countries, I was in trade shows, talking to 100s of people from everywhere all day long. I was in Japan, Taiwan, China, HK and Korea in 2019. I declined handshakes 100s times, only one hug in last 6 months, it was a woman from Massachusetts, she was too fast with that hug, freaked me out. True, everywhere I went turned into hot spots later on. But it wasn’t me, I didn't even have a cold. Experts warn people not to watch too much covid19 news, after so much news, we all sort of get a chill, feeling funny, suspect we got it."
People need to be careful where they get their tests from. Anything that goes through Quest Diagnostics or Labcorp is legit for example.
"Do you wear a mask, Mac?Edited: 1:50 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"""Including the arrogant prikc who won't wear a mask during a pandemic because it's an unbearable infringement on his freedoms.""This could be one of the most ignorant comments I have read on here in awhile."
"I wear a mask going to the Liquor store, weed dispensary, bank, 7/11, or gun store. A month and a half ago logic would say you are a criminal, now it just the norm."
"I have a mask in my backpack 24/7/365 for years, also boxes of masks in office and homes. We are in earthquake and wildfire country, always be prepared. I wore a mask yesterday in bank to drop off a deposit. It’s the law. I have been in home for 6 weeks, I don’t wear mask at home. Last time I wore a mask was flying to NYC 1/30/2020, but everybody in airport looked at me like I was the Coronavirus, I took it off 10 minutes later. It mask is required, I follow the rules. Personal preferences or discomfort is trivia and irrelevant. The benefit of the majority outweighs the individual."
"Re: 23: It's not ignorant at all. Basic common sense dictates that wearing a face mask would reduce the chance of spreading any virus the wearer may have, due to less droplets escaping.Edited: 2:08 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"I *think* as the data comes in, and forensic investigations complete, the timeline will likely get pushed back to maybe Sept/Nov, 2019. I have a feeling that “patient zero” will be found to have been infected, much, much earlier, than currently suspected.After late Dec trip to London, we both fell ill, and all symptoms do seem to match.I am interested in getting the antibody test, but waiting for one of my wife’s hospitals to start that program. At present, they have had poor results, and many bad batches, so not “ready for primetime,” yet.If I can get the test, and results are, as we both suspect, then off to give plasma. Wife cannot give plasma, so only one of us might be a little helpful.Yep, CES, Chinese New Year, Mardi Gras, and similar, possibly have some bearing on the spread of this virus.Hunt"
"“ Yep, CES, Chinese New Year, Mardi Gras, and similar, possibly have some bearing on the spread of this virus.”Let’s throw the Super Bowl in there. NYE in various places. And midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Halloween! We should have shut things down a year ago."
"That is my plan too. If I have antibodies, I'll be donating plasma. I absolutely hate getting my blood drawn. Would never consider donating before that is how much I hate it. However, I'll put up with the extreme discomfort if I can help save 3 very sick people."
Anyplace anywhere that involved a crowd going back to early fall 2019 is a possibility ( maybe even a probability depending on specifics). It doesn't matter much currently ( other than for those studying / understanding the epidemiology of the bug). A likely outcome of these early infections and transmission info will be a positive thing in that it will ultimately reduce the earlier and erroneously modeled fatality / mortality rates published ( not blaming anyone..nobody knew anything about it all). That's got to be good news.

@Tina...that's infatuating...how fast you run the hundred?
Who needs medical experts when we’ve got Tina giving us advice?

"'Nothing spread it throughout the U.S. This was 80% hype and 90% bu$%s$%#.

The main fact will be the no. of deaths, which is currently just under 200,000 confirmed deaths as a result, which is probably more than 300,000 when the non hospital deaths are factored in.

The Dunning-Kruger effect....... in effect
"Swing flu H1N1 in 2009 was declared a pandemic. Globally, an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 people died from swine flu in the first year of the pandemic.I absolutely do not remember it, I didn’t get the memo. Over half a million people died worldwide, it started in the US. Any of you remember it?"
"I heard on news swine flu killed half a million people in 2009, I thought I heard it wrong, because I don’t remember any panic or shutdown. Here's a look back on the 2009 swine flu pandemic with eight key facts from the CDC:1. The flu strain responsible for the outbreak — influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 — was first detected in America in April 2009.2. The strain represented a unique combination of influenza viruses never before seen in humans or animals.3. The virus quickly spread globally, primarily affecting children and adults under 65 who lacked immunity to H1N1.4. The WHO declared the swine flu outbreak a pandemic on June 11, 2009.5. Between April 12, 2009, and April 10, 2010, the CDC estimates swine flu caused 60.8 million illnesses, 273,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths in the U.S.6. On Oct. 5, 2009, the U.S. began administering a newly approved H1N1 vaccine to select Americans, with vaccination coverage expanding nationwide by that December.7. WHO declared an end to the pandemic on Aug. 10, 2010.8. Globally, an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 people died from swine flu in the first year of the pandemic."
Yeah the Swine Flu H1N1. It didn’t effect the US as badly because we had a pandemic response team (until 2018).CDC website: https:/…2009-h1n1-pandemic.html
"We can all do quotes from Google searches:This was a well-conducted investigation into all deaths in England attributed to swine flu up to November 2009. It found that there were 138 deaths from an estimated 540,000 cases, or around 26 deaths per 100,000 people (infected).Edited: 4:33 pm, April 24, 2020 "

"""We should have shut things down a year ago"" Holy cripe. Why dont we keep things totally shut down until a virus is created. Keep people in their homes and only deliveries so nobody leaves home. I think we might find out that all the fear may have been unnecessary. We'll see."
"Well, our preparation will be better for the outbreak in the fall."
FFS Mac IS the super carrier. Make sure to lock him up.

Looks like the Democrats just lost another vote."
"I finished my last trade show 3/10 in Las Vegas, as we were driving back to SF 3/11, heard on car radio 3 new cases found in Mirage, plus other cases in LV. When I arrived 3/6, there was only one case in LV. It was like a Syfy movie as I was driving away from LV @80MPH, the world behind me was collapsing right behind me. Left just in time. I wasn’t even near Mirage. Traveling salesmen can be the worst nightmare for pandemic control, instead of driving town to town, we fly all over the world to sell, which involves nonstop face to face contacts 16 hours a day, 1,000s of people we meet go on to do the same in their world. CES is truly global, except that was in January, if there was wide spread infections, it wouldn’t wait 2 months. You’d know in 2 weeks, early February. Only one case in LV by early March."
What are the odds that Tina does not believe we had men on the moon?
"Tina only watches PMSNBC, and gets all other news from Twitter.No way to help some folk.Best of luck, and stay safe, in this cruel world.Hunt"
"What news do you watch, Hunt?"
#50 DTC. Isn’t it obvious?
"DTC,Fox is #1. Then, Fox Business.Within Fox, a tie between Neil Cavuto and Tucker Carlson.Then, probably a toss-up with CNN and NBC tired for #3, but quite a ways down the list.Bloomberg shows up too, but I only see MSNBC in clips elsewhere - nothing for me thee.Hunt"
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas..... or maybe not!
I got very sick after working CES. I’m pretty sure I got it. Going to get tested for antibodies this week.
Yeah. 5 months later. It’s good to be proactive on these things.
"""APM Reports also says a little more than 100 people attended this year's conference from Wuhan, China — where the first outbreak was recorded towards the end of 2019""............. No doubt they helped speed the virus here........How many people will want to be at CES next year?"
Get tested for common sense as well. 13
"Some people cannot count, CES was January 7-10, Covid19 does not stay inactive for many month in your body. I was in Las Vegas in January and March 5-11, there was only one Covid-19 case in Las Vegas at that time."
“ How many people will want to be at CES next year?”It probably won’t take place.
"This, too, shall pass. As did all crisis in the past. Conventions and trade shows are coming back. We have trade shows in August: Seattle, Los angles and lus Vegas. October, Dallas. We also signed up, paid for trade shows in 2021, February on, hotels booked. If my competitors think this is the end of world of business and stop all marketing and trade shows, that is good news to me."
