"I’m looking for a location for a very large party of people. Ideally, everyone would be contained in a single structure (i.e. a high rise building), though I suppose this is not a requirement. Security is very important. Either room service availability or a full kitchen is a must. On-site dining would be a plus.The stay will be a minimum of two weeks. The budget is flexible. Any thoughts on the best place to start looking? And the best way to go about booking? I know dealing directly with the owners can save booking and management fees. Can I just call up the Andaz and ask to book all their rooms? Also, what’s the best way to avoid a really thorough and expensive cleaning fee?"
"Sunny, how about the Villas at Andaz, the Villas at Kea Lani, or the Montage? Or maybe a buyout of the Hotel Wailea?"
"Hotel Wailea is a great call! There’s a gate, they don’t allow kids, and there’s already employee housing."
"So how many people total are you talking, Sunny? Are they perchance your in laws and relatives from NZ?Why is security so important.......curiosity is killing me!"
"The final numbers are still in a state of flux. I’m expecting they’ll start increasing exponentially by the end of the week.Edited: 1:04 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"<""The budget is flexible."">But no more than $200/night all in?"
"Ahhh.....escapees from a cruise ship? Or California, Washington, New York or another COVID-19 state?Will they bring their own toilet paper?"
"“But no more than $200/night all in?“Money is really no object. But I see no reason to waste money...I mean if a resort is going to be empty anyway, we should totally be getting a government rate."
“Will they bring their own toilet paper?“I don’t know why anyone would travel without their own toilet paper...
Four Seasons is doing a sale--it's supposedly for Kama'aina only.....but I bet you could get a good rate.
Sunny are invitations going out in the mail? Should I be checking my mailbox? :)
"I think you'll want to house this group in Wailuku...near Maui Memorial. Will you be planning to 'weld them in', as I've read is happening elsewhere in the world?"
