"I’m flying over to Bali for two weeks with my husband, with the current covid19 outbreak and my husband being a high risk I was wondering if anyone had had any first hand experiences with the hospitals over there? I’m heading to Canggu Ubud and Seminyak is there hospital in these areas or am I miles away? I just really need reassurance please. Thanks in advance Sarah"
"Canggu is next door to Seminyak.BIMC have various hospitals with bigger ones ""down south"".BIMC in Ubud is a smaller Klinik.Ubud to Kuta ~ 1h30Seminyak to BIMC Kuta only 15-20mins"
"Hi Sarah, as above are most of the main hospitals. I have spent time in Siloam in Kuta. The best advice I can give is come with your insurance certificate and the patients passport. Treatment seemed quicker in emergency than at home. Don't expect sandwiches and cups of tea though when admitted, I wasn't even offered water. Checking out was a very lengthy and officious event. I wouldn't want to spend any time there if could be avoided."
"If you are afraid of Covid-19, the best hospital to handle it is Sanglah Hospital. The other hospitals to handle Covid-19 are Tabanan Hospital and Sanjiwani Gianyar Hospital. They have isolation rooms."
"Having high risk of contracting coronavirus? If somebody shows covid-19 symptoms, your first medical responder e.g. puskesmas (community health facilities) or private hospitals e.g. mentioned in post 1 and 2 will send patients to large government-owned hospitals. That hospitals usually have observation/isolation rooms for infectious diseases. RS Sanglah Denpasar is the biggest hospital in Bali province"
Check your travel insurance before you go to one of the BIMC international hospitals or you might be up for a large bill. Some policies have a total block on all pandemics.
"So, as I suggest in #3 go to these hospitals directly. In Jakarta from 19 positive Covid-19 patients, 6 patients are foreigners."
