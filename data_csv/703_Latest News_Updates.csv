"So I heard again today that American will be allowed to start flying June 1 and are planning for first flights June 4 in Exuma.I heard that the Prime Minister will be announcing this at the end of May including 'opening the borders'.Of course, this is only what I have heard so far."
This would be awesome! Let's keep hoping it will come true!
"No way June 1st! We are only in Phase 1b of a 6 stage plan to reopen -- with Stage 5 being when the borders will open. No way we are going through 4 more stages between now and June 1. I just don't see it. Besides, where do you think these visitors are going to come from? And bring goodness knows what with them to out islands that have seen no COVID-19 cases. That's insane and idiotic, and all that work for nothing (See Germany, South Korea, China, and the lovely state of Georgia as to why this is so) Hang in there -- it will happen, but not June 1st."
"We received an email this morning form Delta that our June 9th flight to Georgetown was canceled. Glad Exuma is taking all of this serious and doing all they can to prevent it from getting to their island...but, still very disappointed to have to postpone our trip. So sad!"
Same for us. Our June 17th flight on Delta was cancelled this morning. Stay safe and we hope to be back to the Out Islands when it is safe to do so.
Delta cancelled our June 28th flight :(.
Hey I'm just letting people know what I'm hearing from people that work at American Airlines who are in contact with people that decide things.Beginning flying 3 weeks from now seems realistic. Would I put my 91 year old father on a plane? Nope but he doesn't like flying anyway. Precautions will be done. At the end of the day this is a virus and it affects everyone different like all viruses do.Decisions for weeks from now are being made today but that doesn't mean decisions won't be changed weeks from now.Try being a glass is half full guy instead of glass is half empty.
"Thank you @littlejohn I appreciate your take on this, - I am all for ""Seeing the glass half full"" vs half empty :) Maybe if flights do resume, probably with restrictions, same as in border opening. I could see maybe resorts like Sandals not be open till later in the year, but private residents can have visitors/guests. Just guessing, we can only take it day by day and be hopeful!"
"The latest:After American met with the govt today, they have pushed back it's opening date to July 7. American has to plan it's flight banks by certain dates so they have now tentatively decided on July 7.We will be canceling our house stay but are looking at dates for end of July early August. It's difficult because there are 11-12 of us traveling!Haven't received flight cancel from AA yet but this just happened."
"Looks like Delta was busy this morning. We were scheduled for June 13 and the flights were cancelled this morning. I’m grateful we can now get a refund versus credit, but so sad to be missing my sea turtles this year :( now the long wait for next June!"
My son and his friends had a “graduation celebration “ trip scheduled on Delta for June 9th. They were so excited for this trip and all the graduation festivities. Delta sent an email this morning canceling their trip :(We have a family trip scheduled for July 11th to Exuma. Hoping it’s safe to travel by then.
"littlejohn, I can appreciate everyone's wish to get back to Exuma (and the out islands), and being cautious is not about being ""glass half-empty"", but rather being aware of the risks and benefits and finding a balance. The reality is that even if the Bahamas is completely COVID-19 free -- best case scenario -- why one earth would we have done months of lockdowns and precautions only to allow flights from the US, who are awash in new and, in many states, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases? We will not reopen until the US (and other areas from which our visitors come) get their cases under control. It's admirable that you wouldn't put your 91 year old father on a flight to the Bahamas. What about my family and friends here in the Bahamas? As it is, even our own citizens cannot just get on a plane and come home. They have to go through a convoluted process to get tested in the US, then be added to a list and perhaps have access to a chartered flight operated by the Bahamas government. And once they arrive, they must go into 2 weeks quarantine. Would tourists agree to these restrictions? We will get there, but rushing the process will end badly -- as many places are learning. We do not want to make the same mistake!"
"I believe that you Dusty have misunderstood my comment. Without continuing with an argument, I will say that I have no problem as a tourist being quarantined on Exuma for 2 weeks and welcome that restriction. In fact, I will volunteer for that position."
"Yeah, LJ, didn't have the optimistic feeling this week that I had last week about your trip. Its great that you are getting scuttlebutt on the AA situation....I hope its reliable. With Bimini issues and the repatriation snafu, it may push things back even more, but let the 30% unemployment go too much longer and it may be as bad as the disease ever will be. But, July is pretty far off (as when we talked last month about June), so maybe Mid to late July is good, and hopefully the airlines will still be around by then..."
"Heard they opened travel back to citizens, residents and homeowners. A little hope for my late July trip."
"Shelby C, the Bahamas borders remain closed. No one is allowed back into the country at this time, unless they have specific permission and clearance to do so. There were 2 repatriation flights from Florida into the Bahamas last week. Those were flights arranged by the Bahamas government to bring back Bahamians who had been stranded in the US. Because of procedural issues, those flights have now been suspended. So, no, no Bahamians, residents and least of all, homeowners, are being allowed in at this time. There are extremely limited permissions being given to private individuals, but even that has been curtailed -- thanks to a couple of high-profile individuals who didn't think the rules applied to them. We are not even permitted domestic travel in the Bahamas -- and again, only with prior permission (emergency medical flights, essential personnel movements, etc.) The borders will remain closed until State 5. We are now in stage 1b. Factor a minimum timeline of 2-4 weeks before moving to the next stage of reopening."
Copy of email received from Makers Air. This may change but seems like homeowners could return but need to stay isolated for 14 days. https:/…
Makers Air and Staniel Cay are both advertising otherwise.
"Apologies - I obviously stand corrected. This information has not been made widely available to the Bahamian public - so clearly there are mixed messages being sent out. I'm astounded that while I, a Bahamian in the Bahamas, who has been under lockdown and curfews since March 15, cannot travel from one island in the Bahamas to another (even between ones with no reported cases), yet if I were outside the Bahamas, I could easily get permission to travel to any island I wished. There's definitely an incongruity there. Makes me wonder why I even bothered following the rules. A COVID-19 test within the past 7 days (as they are requiring) is useless in determining if someone is not infected on arrival into the Bahamas. Why bother with testing?Edited: 2:33 pm, May 15, 2020 "
"i redid my trip for aug 3 and need to make my last payment by july 3 hope things are good by july 3 , hate to play the payment and not be able to go , she is not giving a refund , aug3 is a while out ,,,ill keep watching"
As an outsider it’s so hard to understand what’s going on. Were scheduled to come in June 28 And stay for 10 days. It’s time for our usual visit were currently coming about three times a year. We have secured a real estate agent and an attorney and planning on buying a place. So obviously we were very excited to come down and look at property and visit as usual. We have been in extreme quarantine here in Kansas City and felt comfortable coming there because we don’t need to see people and as long as we can get our hands on some groceries and supplies we’re OK with that. And we’re very mindful we don’t want to get anyone sick. That being being said our flight to exuma hasn’t been canceled. But if you actually search the flight it’s not there anymore so it’s like who has our money or we still going we have no idea what’s happening. If we have to wait that’s fine we want to do what’s in the best interest for everyone involved but just not knowing anything is really mentally exhausting. It’s a very frustrating situation we want to do what’s best for the island as far as keeping it safe but we also understand that they do need tourist dollars and at what point do you take that risk
"Absolutely the feeling right now is June is not going to work out. The airlines (AA at least) keeps you hoping that they will fly, but as I checked the flights three days out (get the actual flight number you will be on and track it) they are all canceled. I, like you enjoy getting away from the rat race and getting lost on Exuma, but we got to play it by their rules. I monitor the Bahamian news daily, but not much going on there either, other than the political drama and increasing unemployment. Actually there is a sense of relief when we gave up and canceled our trip (moved it to October), so that's one way to cure the mental exhaustion. Push the June trip back as far as you can, and be ready with a few alternate dates between now and then to treat yourself to a bonus visit, and monitor the situation.Edited: 1:49 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"Our American Airlines flight for July 1 was cancelled yesterday- we did not get an email, I was randomly just checking. When I called AA they said their first flight into GGT will be July 7. So it looks like littlejohn’s info was correct!Edited: 1:06 pm, May 24, 2020 "
We did get calls from American about our flights being canceled BUT you have to request a refund. It was easy to do online.We haven't rescheduled our family trip yet but wife and I will probably run down there as soon as we are sure things are back open.
We still have our tickets for July 11th......we shall see.
We were able to rebook for July 7-15 and our house was available! Fingers crossed!
"In reply to mrsmuth from kansas who said:""As an outsider it’s so hard to understand what’s going on. Were scheduled to come in June 28 And stay for 10 days.

It’s a very frustrating situation we want to do what’s best for the island as far as keeping it safe but we also understand that they do need tourist dollars and at what point do you take that risk.""So Kansas City is in extreme quarantine so it must have plenty of cases of covid19. And you don't see a problem with getting on a plane and flying from Kansas City to Great Exuma, along with other people in Kansas City who haven't necessarily bothered with quarantine. From there, you hopefully are going to Nassau and then on to Great Exuma. There aren't many cases in Nassau. But if you plan to travel through Florida, the east coast airports will still be loaded with covid19. That's the hotspot for Florida, and the airports and cruiseports in FLL and MIA are where the vast majority of cases in Florida have come from. And after exposing yourself to others on your way to Great Exuma, you don't plan to meet with anyone when you arrive there, except for the airline and airport employees, you real estate agent who will take you throught properties that may be visited by others, the employees at the grocery store and other places where you need supplies. And if you find a property, you'll meet with your attorney, and those in the office will be affected.So when you say ""And we’re very mindful we don’t want to get anyone sick."", buy everything you've said about getting yourself there when flights are still being cancelled, and there's no solid reopening date from the PM says otherwise. Just think about someone bringing covid19 from Kansas to Nassau, which has a limited number of cases and is under control, and then passing it on to other islands that may have no current cases (or have never had any at all).And what will happen on your flight to Great Exuma? Even if you're negative, someone else on your flight, or in an airport, may have passed it on to you. Then you pass it on to those you plan to meet with, and the places that supply your needs. Have you looked at the medical facilities on Great Exuma? There's a clinic. They can't handle covid19, and going to the clinic to spread it to others would not be a good way to introduce yourself to the locals in a place where you want to live. Just wait. There will still be plenty of properties to buy when it's safer to go. The PM has said that the beginning of July is the earliest that tourist will be welcomed. And I doubt that hurricane season will have a lot of real estate sales over the summer."
Man I am so impressed! You have managed to comment on like ever single Bahamas post of trip advisor with your amazing opinions this weekend. Also We don’t go through Nassau. Do your research before you go spouting off.
"@SWFAOK I would not do anything unless the government allows it and even then I will be cautious. None of us on this forum plan on breaking the rules. This is why we are following the government mandates very closely. When they tell us it is safe to visit, we will."
Thank you
Delta and American Airlines has apparently cancelled all fights into Georgetown for July:( Waiting for a call back from Delta to confirm. The recording said I would receive a call back in 3 hours.
"This is ridiculous. You ASSUME that Kansas City has been on extremely lock down. The poster didn't say that. They said that THEY have been on extreme lock down. The entire state of Missour has had a MAX of 600 deaths. They are a state of 6 million, which puts their death rate at about .01%. Cases in MIssour are also in decline. If the Bahamas are open, there is no reason not to go."
Bummer girl! I thought they were just starting up in July.Guess we can now look forward to August!
Exactly! MY family has taken care of themselves. Plus we’re on the Kansas side of Kansas City with a competent governor. It looks like it doesn’t matter. If all the flights are canceled anyways...
"ours is for aug 3 , i did get a flight number change thats all ,if its canceled again mand dont know what ill do, the lady wont give our money back for house , iam in a pickle"
"Maybe you can find someone to rent the house, pay you and stay there if you aren't able to go."
"My flight with AA from LA is on July 22nd. It has not been canceled as of today. I am crossing my fingers that it will be. I do not feel safe sitting on a plane for 5 hours to Miami then another flight to Exuma for a total of 3 airports in 1 day.Edited: 4:56 pm, May 25, 2020 "
We rebooked our cancelled Delta flights to American Airlines. Our flight is on July 19th. We shall see.
I received an email from Hideaways that 'they' weren't opening till Nov 1. Is that just for Hideaways and facilities or other rentals there?
"Roe, did you get confirmation? We’re flying American and didn’t get any notification yet"
"littlejohn, is the November 1 date for rentals at Hideways? We aren’t booked at Hidaways but have two trips booked for September and October and hoping that isn’t an indication of what to expect."
"This is the email:Dear Friends of Hideaways & Island Time Villas,Here is what we have learned with regards to the re-launch of travel to the Bahamas and Exuma in particular. Exuma continues to be on hold until May 30, 2020 prior to beginning Phase 1B of re-opening.Exuma continues to be on weekend lock down, with weekday curfews still in place. Lockdown measures still remain in place, as do physical distancing measures and the requirement to wear masks. Commercial Business has not been cleared to resume business, essential services such as grocery stores, gas stations & pharmacy continue to operate with reduced operational hours. Any such re-opening to commercial scale traffic will also be dependent on the ongoing stabilization of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Bahamas. Resumption of Domestic Travel/Inter-Island Travel still be determined. Resumption of International Flights still to be determined. With the above in mind, we have made the decision to hold off re-opening Hideaways Exuma & Island Time Villas.Over the next several months, Hideaways will work to implement new staff guidelines, staff training, policies, procedures & protocols, to adjust to these changing times. The tentative date for Hideaways & Island Time Villas to re-open is November 1, 2020. The few guests with reservations that are scheduled to arrive between now and the re-launch will be contacted to re-schedule travel dates.Our Reservations Department will continue to operate, our toll free phone will be answered daily during normal business hours, emails will be responded to within a few hours."
"As homeowners in the Hideaways with rentals booked, we have sent a message to the owners of the resort asking for clarification. As soon as we hear back, my husband will be sending an email to our future guests."
Fingers crossed. I am scheduled for mid July since the Prime Minister said On or before July 1 if all goes well. I booked in Delta but seems all flight for July are gone in my region. Thanks For the update
Same here July 12 Delta
"We were on the July 2 Atlanta to Georgetown flight and now when I search the confirmation number my reservation can’t be found. I have reached out to Delta, but assume this means our flights have been canceled."
"No, it doesn't necessarily mean the flight has been cancelled. Same thing happened to me. It just meant the flight was sold out and they were no longer selling seats on it. Best to call before you make that assumption."
"Delta canceled all flights into Georgetown until July 31st. I was told this by a Delta representative yesterday when I called to check on our July 11th flights. They are however, flying into Nassau in July so you would need to book a separate flight from Nassau to Georgetown. We decided to book with American Airlines which still has flights going to Georgetown in July. Hopefully the Bahamas will open its borders and the flights are not cancelled."
hope ours in aug3 is good
Roe2868I just received a cancellation notice from Delta also atl to ggt July 12. I have a ticket on hold with American. So just to confirm deta cancelled all flight? Did they give your money back? Did you have insurance?
Pm speaking now. Country on lock down til end of June. So doesn’t look like airports are opening up anytime soon.
He moved the Bahamas into Phase 3 which is a good sign!
whats the mean ?
Maybe this helps:https://ewnews.com/phase-3-churches-gaming-h…
"According to this article, it was announced that travelers will be allowed back July 1. This is the only article that I can find that says this, so I do not know how accurate it is, but it was just posted today.https://www.travelpulse.com/news/destination…Also, has anyone noticed the application for International Travel on the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism & Aviation website? Does anyone know if this is just for residents returning to The Bahamas from abroad?https://tinyurl.com/yahjt24f"
"Littlejohn I think you mean July not June? I don't see flights July 4, but they are there the following week. Sandals has stated opening July 1 and seems to be taking reservations."
"tourism isnt till phase 5 , beaches are open , dont see anything about travel until phase 5"
"I saw that Travel Pulse article too - but don't see any real proof from the government that supports their claim. Sandals can take all the reservations they want, but that's a very optimistic play...who knows."
"The Prime Minister has announced hopeful optimism that Phase 5, which includes opening the borders, to happen in July. The new extended emergency orders expire June 29. If all goes well, there is hope! The International Travel forms are for returning Bahamians and Residents. Not sure what the process will be for tourists once we do open. Some of the Family Islands get to go back to mostly business as usual, minus the tourism, starting Tuesday the 2nd, but with curfews and weekend lockdowns through June. It’s a start, and we can go to the beach again!"
"Just had an online chat with an agent on the Bahamian Tourism website.https://www.bahamas.com/pressroom/bahamas-mi… I asked about policies, dates, what would change opening, etc. This was the response I was given.""At this time, our borders are still closed until our now confirmed date July 1st for international flights into The Bahamas. As for persons traveling via private vessel, yachting and private airlines, due to our first part of our reopening phase can access The Bahamas starting June 15th. I would recommend those traveling via private vessel and yachting to contact Bahamas Boating Association ( 844-556-5290 | U.S. 954-462-4591) and Bahamas Immigration (1-242-322-7530/1-242-604-0199/ 1-242-604-0201 ) for further assistance on the process. For those traveling via private aircraft, please contact our Department of Aviation ( 242 397 4700 ) for further assistance on the process.""I asked if Exuma was included because on the website it is not listed as cleared and was told the above paragraph is the latest information as of the press conference at 10 am today.""Me:In the paragraph on this website it says access for international travellers will apply only to those islands where the outbreak has been contained.Exuma is not listed as one of those islands. Bahamas Agent 4The above paragraph is the updated information since our press conference today at 10:00 a.m.""So, from what I can tell, July 1 Exuma will re-open to commercial travel.My questions at this point would be and don't know if anyone can answer...1. Are locals comfortable with this and do local businesses plan on reopening?2. Are protocols/guidelines going to be in place in the Bahamas? Eg, restaurants at XX% capacity, face masks encouraged/required in grocery stores, etc?We're looking at taking a trip to Exuma in the fall, but I'd be hesitant to go if we're not wanted, if local businesses aren't going to be open, or if there aren't any safety precautions in place.Exuma is obviously a rather spacious and there aren't many instances where maintaining proper distance would be difficult....but there are a few places that get busy. :)"
"Soooo...we are flying into Nassau on 7/18 and getting on a live-aboard catamarn for a one week sail down to the Exumas. We are then supposed to fly back to Fort Laurderdale on Silver Airways on 7/25 from GGT. Based on what you learned, is this trip still possible? I can't get a straight answer."
"Today it was announced as part of the return to tourism that interisland commercial travel will resume June 8. June 15 private pilots, perm residents and homeowners can return and July 1 all commercial tourism will commence including Airbnb, Hotel, taxi etc.. across all islands. Also, noted was no covid travel card will be required to enter."
"@susanfarley I would love to hear more information on your catamaran trip if you wouldn’t mind sharing.Edited: 7:06 pm, June 02, 2020 "
"Ben K - it sounds like good news based on real governmental source info. I am sure the Exuma folk will appreciate the business; I am just cautious on the ""to test the waters"" theory as far as travel for outlanders commencing on July 1. What if 5, 10, 20, 50, etc... test positive in the first week; does that mean the country will abruptly shut down again? I want to go there soooo bad, but am not 100% on if its a prudent decision. Exuma is pretty sparse, but what if Nassau gets a surge in cases - are we all going to suffer the consequence?"
Looks like all have heard about the July opening! We are really ready for real social distancing!I don't think we will be booking a flight until after they are landing on Exuma and we see where the requirements end up. But we can leave tomorrow if we need to.
If you REALLY want to see what the plan for The Bahamas is... Here's the link for the 108 page report!https:/…trrc_plan_public.pdf
"Hello, The official reopening date of The Bahamas is July 1st 2020 for all commercial airlines. The Bahamas will be open for boaters, yachters, private aviation on June 15th 2020. The Bahamas is ready to welcome you to our shores. You can receive updates for our phased re-opening on www.bahamas.comEdited: 1:10 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"LJ:Thanks for the info. I did notice that in the airline section I observed ""traveling with medical certificates indicating good health"" mentioned a couple of times. Any enlightenment here?"
Man I don’t know what the heck is going on. Went to look at flights for the end of July. And now all the American flights are gone. I also follow a fb page and people are freaking out that their July flights have all been canceled with American. Really hoping that it’s just a glitch and maybe either I’m regrouping and they will all come back up this afternoon
"@mrsmuth, same here. My flight from LA on July 22nd is still active, but when I tried booking another ticket with the same dates, it gave me “error” message."
Yes I noticed that too...wow
"They changed our flight today to leave later on July 15 but our arrival flight into Exuma on July 7 stayed the sameEdited: 2:26 pm, June 07, 2020 "
The Prime Minister also announced on June 4 they are entering phase 4 so I think that’s a good sign. I am willing our trip to happen as hard as I can!
"our flights first week in July were cancelled, and I was not able to rebook mid July, so I am wondering if American is waiting till July 1. and then make flights available again? Or maybe all tourists have to fly through Nassau? We will wait and see till things settle down a bit, our April stay was rebooked for end Oct. our July stay might have to wait till next year."
Our American Airlines flight for July 9th from Pensacola-Miami-Georgetown was canceled today. They left our return flight on the 17th. American said I should cancel and request a refund. I still hope they might rebook on another flight. I could cancel and book through Silver Airways. We need a vacation so bad! Why is American doing this? Do you guys trust Silver?
"you have me worried now , ours is with delta all the way to and from , i am calling them tomorrow and see if anything has changed , i see the island will be open july 1 to all travelers no ?"
"Unfortunately we decided to postpone our trip. We were scheduled to be there July 25-Aug 1. With all the uncertainty, we thought it best to wait. The villa owner could not have been kinder and allowed us to rebook for next year. We also rebooked our ATV tour and Minns rental. Everyone has been so nice. We’re so disappointed but we can’t wait until next year!"
"Just overnight all AA flights dried up from DC in July, so they either got booked or AA dropped them...dunno. Decided to try for August and all flights seemed to be back to normal again on Expedia around August 3."
Not too sure what’s going on with AA either. We are booked July 24-Aug 1st from DFW to GGT. When I log in it says there’s been a change but nothing updated yet. Hopefully this is just a glitch.
"I've been asking and checking and it looks like MOST seats are pretty booked! They are still playing around with number of flights/days, etc so plan for glitches. I found it easier to find a seat if I booked directly from MIA to GGT as opposed to from my home city. You might also check on single seats or one way and then before 'booking' it make another reservation on another computer window. Yea, we gotta get creative sometimes!More seats available in August right now but a few here and there for July."
I spoke to someone with friends in GTT and they said that the island is pretty well booked for July!
I called this morning in the way to work. They said my flight to GGT is good but flight back got cancelled. I either have to stay 4 more days or leave the next day from Nassau. Hopefully they fix this for me and not charge us.
RayJen- what are your dates?
July 24 - Aug 1stDeparture is good but not the return
"Super disappointed in how our resort has handled this entire situation. We were traveling from Nevada to Bahamas for 5 nights--3 at one resort, 2 at the sister property. Travel dates June 28-July 3. Our flights were canceled since international travel isn't permitted in June. Our hotel FINALLY agreed to refund us, but only for June 28-30 (since the resort is closed), not for July 1-3. We can't find flights that will get us there on July 1, and even if we could, it's crazy to travel all of that way for 2 nights (and we aren't able to extend our vacation for more days on the July end). I'm so disappointed that the resort insists on keeping our money given the circumstances.Edited: 1:01 pm, June 10, 2020 "
Vegasbaby.. that’s pretty crappy.... hopefully they will change their tune... I would suggest a little social media post. That tends to work for most businesses. On a positive note!!! Took about an hour and a half on the phone with American but we are all rescheduled for the end of July. Took a little bit of pushback from us because they were trying to make us pay the difference. Which was minimal. But we were like hey you canceled our flights! Not us. But it kind of worked out in a way because one of our flights was booked on points and it was actually considerably less points to fly with the new flight so that was good
"@VegasBaby, check with your credit card if you have insurance coverage for this type of situation. Under normal circumstance, they probably wouldn’t cover but these are unconventional times so who knows. Never hurts to ask."
"Thank you! Yes our credit card company has gone above and beyond. Really amazing. I went the social media route. The hotel responded and made up some story about how I tried to cancel before corona and just used corona as an excuse. Which isn’t true. I tried to give them plenty of notice, they said wait it out. We waited it out and now they won’t refund. For anyone interested...it’s Peace and Plenty/kahari resort."
"We had plans for staying at Kahari too. We just canceled for July because we can't get there - American Airlines is only flying there on certain days that didn't mesh with our hotel reservations. I just looked back at Trip Advisor to see your post and see that you are the folks who got the nonrefundable reservations! That's tough to negotiate under any circumstances so I feel for you. We have been following Exuma, Nassau and Turks and Caicos situations (we had reservations in each - don't ask :)) and don't see that hotels are giving $$ refunds if you have non-refundable reservations and they are supposed to be open, like Kahari - which is scheduled to open on June 29. Good luck!. I would guess that you are out of luck for those two nights. We always get refundable reservations because of being burned."
"Yes non refundable. We had flights booked too. I almost always book refundable, this time we didn’t. I understand their position too. But to not even offer a credit or anything!? They already canceled half of our reservation but won’t refund or credit the rest. And they have not been kind or forthcoming through any of this. Getting them to even answer the phone to answer basic questions has been a nightmare. We can’t even get there in time for the reservation coming from Las Vegas...there are no flights. Like I said, I feel for the Bahamas, but coming from a tourist town where the hotels have gone above and beyond to accommodate the customers/tourists, it’s hard to understand the lack of care and concern for the consumer."
"Latest update from Hideaways:After the most recent Press Conference, we have revised our plan for our re-launch. We will be prepared for guest arrivals beginning the first week in July. Of course this is all subject to the current plan by the government to allow international flights beginning July 1, 2020.Things will be a little different, as we slowly phase into having the property completely open. Following are our new protocols in response to COVID-19.

"Oh wow, I hope they re-open Splash...it kind of rounds out the experience. Any word on Chat-N-Chill?"
"Whitney - I would say that at this point any international travel is a risk in terms of interruptions, but the odds are looking in your favor for Great Exuma in early August. Since airlines are opening up 7/1, that gives other facilities an entire month to follow suit. If for some reason the businesses you are looking forward to are not open, you can still have an amazing time regardless!All of this said, just expect the unexpected, as this situation will be fluid for quite some time."
"@george5th: I haven't check with Chat N Chill but I'll text them tomorrow.@Whitney Allen: I would expect all will be good. Like Sara said, expect the unexpected! That's just how it is on small islands anyway. If you get stuck at Airbnb, just male sure it's a nice one!"
Fish fry was bumping last night. Never seen so many people there before. Seacor parking was full. People were parking down at Augusta bay. Crazy!
"i see Augusta bay is just down the road from we will be staying , be nice to talk to the people staying there now ."
Augusta Bay still closed they are opening July 1.
"ohh sorry , we are staying up the road there ,, thanks"
Question for you guys. Does anybody know yet what the restrictions are going to look like come July 1st?Will international passengers still need to document a negative test within 48 hours?Will there be a 14 day quarantine? Apologies if this information is out there.
@lott are you down there how did you get there ??
"According to The Bahamas website, no Covid test or quarantine is required, only an electronic health declaration.https://www.bahamas.com/tourism-reopeningEdited: 6:21 pm, June 13, 2020 "
Lots of chatter on fb about delta canceling a ton if not all flights the rest of the year. My husband is on hold with them right now. He is flying down on Delta August 3 and meeting me and the kids but then we’re flying home on American. The kids and i are on aa both legs. When he logs into his account his flight still shows up so I don’t know what to expect
Mrsmuth that’s interesting because I was looking last week at flights for our trip in November and Delta had flights for our travel days and I checked again yesterday and no flights for them were showing up.
"Delta told me they are resuming their flight to Georgetown on July 31st , 2020"
Did they tell you this today? Our November flight is showing cancelled.
My husband spoke to someone a from delta a few hours ago and as of right now his flight is still on. I am wondering if they switched to smaller planes and added sooner distancing. And some people are just lucky and some are not? I have no clue I am just speculating...
"@jordans, Delta told me this about 3 weeks ago."
After reading yesterdays posts I logged into Delta and had a notice that my flight from Altanta to GGT has been cancelled in September. Thanks for the posts.
"That's a bummer! Airlines are reducing flights and schedules so even though your flight THAT day is canceled, they might/probably have another flight within a day or two of yours."
"just signed into delta and changed my seats ,, all good so far ,( aug3-8"
You will be on the same flight as my husband! He is coming down that day on delta. The kids and I are going a week prior. Maybe I will get to meet you!
"So this news is out now (and thanks to those who sent me this info!):https://ewnews.com/negative-covid-19-test-ma…The article doesn't address how recent a test needs to be completed, what criteria needs to be utilized, what is an acceptable form of test reporting is and so forth.Of course, this was from TODAYS news and when it deals with this virus, it changes daily!"
Visitors must have evidence of negative covid test taken within 10 days of arrival
Any age limitations? Or toddlers included? I couldn’t find that answer.
Children under age 2 not required to have test. And don’t forget to fill out the travel health form at travel.gov.bs
dont understand if the airlines don say anything about and we get there what then ?
"The airlines will be required to follow the protocols set by the Bahamian government -- meaning that they will have to check for all the required documents (passports, health and contact forms filled out, etc.) and proof of a negative COVID-19 test done within the past 10 days for all passengers (except those under the age of 2) If you don't have this documentation, you likely will not be allowed to board the flight. An immigration form will be given to you on the flight to be filled out and presented to Bahamas Immigration on arrival -- one form per passenger."
"Lilrobo- without the proper documents, which you do now know about, you risk being denied entry. I wouldn’t chance it. We recently had some homeowners attempt to come back via charter plane, and when they arrived without the tests or permission, they were denied the flight. The airlines will most likely be appraised of what is need for travelers to the Bahamas, similar to the requirement to have a return ticket."
Here's the link to fill out the required form. Please not that there is a box to upload a test result and this submission form is required for each traveler.https://travel.gov.bs/international
"Folks around me are saying yet again another hurdle and maybe this trip isn't meant to be but I am determined because we NEED this vacation. Anyhow, I saw on FB some talking about officials not allowing rapid tests but allowing the nasal tests.....does anyone have any insight? I'm not a medical person but the rapid tests are nasal."
"It’s the antibody tests that aren’t allowed. They do need to be deep nasal swabs, from what I have heard."
So how long are test results taking to get back? I know it was 7 days or so which doesnt leave much time for error. We have a trip for 7/17 thru 7/24 and need to make a decision next week if we are going.
"Regarding the form on the Bahamas site, has anyone who filled it out and sent it received an email back? Three of us filled it out and none of us received a reply or email. I would feel a lot better if I knew my information was received. Traveling mid August. Thanks."
"you would think the airlines would tell us , if they know , ill bet they dont know anything more ,, i am supposed to pay the rest of my deposit july 3 , hope something come out by then '"
hey little john what is the box beside the travel doc .i do have a passport whats the box to the right ?
"I don’t know which nasal swab they will recognize...or if they will take whichever one you get...but there are three different types of nasal swab tests. And which one you get is determined by which lab the test is sent to for evaluation. Different labs required different types of nasal swabs. (My husband is a pharmacist who has been trained to administer the tests. He isn’t doing them yet, but has received the training. We live in a county that has had a total of 12 cases so far so his employer is rolling this out in cities and locations with a hot spot first). There is the “stick it in to your brain” test that the professional administers. There is one that goes in 3” or so and has to stay in your nose several seconds that is self-administered but with professional oversight, and the third one goes in maybe 1” and stays in the nose even longer. Also self administered with professional supervision. And all of them have to be done in each side of the nose.Edited: 8:03 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"ok i fill one out , out trip is aug3 the certificate expires on 04/07/2020, so thats july 4 ill have to fill out another a little closer , i guess"
Why are people filling out the form for travel months away?My interpretation is that you fill that out after you receive your test results. (<10 days prior to travel). What do y’all think?
You are correct we only fill it out after you have a test within 10 days of travel. We’re still a little over a month away but we’re scrambling I have made several phone calls today and it is not that easy to get a test where I live if you’re not symptomatic. And finding one for my kids is going to be even harder.
Does anyone know if travel insurance is required? Or is it just a question on the form ??Thaks
Yeah that’s what I’m concerned about. Finding a place to get a test when we have no symptoms. They are doing a free test date here in arlington but of course it’s not within 10 days of our trip. We don’t go until August and I still haven’t re-booked our outbound flight that was canceled bc we don’t know what to do. Ugh!
Update found a place that I have to pay $35 non-refundable but they will give us the test Question :: the travel form asks for Travel Insurance. Do we HAVE to have travel insurance? I think our credit card includes travel coverage but there isn’t a specific travelers policy number I don’t think.
That’s for your passport number- the box next to passport.
"Here’s our experience so far. We are in Austin Texas. We are traveling via air on 7/2 from Florida to Nassau. We called our primary care dr and scheduled a telemed appointment. We told our dr we are traveling out of the country and are require to have a nasal swab covid test. He issues lab orders. We are going through the drive through testing location on 6/23. This puts our test exactly 10 days out of our date of entry to the Bahamas. If our tests are negative, we will submit them results online via the Health Ministry form along with a copy of our passport. My understanding is the form can be submitted via Bahamas.com/international and they are expediting approvals. We hope to have our test results within 3-5 days of the 6/23 test. Which gives the government a little less than the required five business days of travel. Keeping our fingers crossed we do test negative- we have both been work from home since March and staying at home with limited exposure and strict mask wearing. We certainly don’t want to travel outside the country if we are positive. We are driving to Florida to reduce our exposure risk. Just thought I’d share our experience and plans in case or helps anyone else. Good luck everyone! I’ll update our progress once we submit the form and let you know how that goes."
@jennifer K what do you mean the required 5 business days? Now you have me worried. I’m scheduling a COVID test for July 27 and we will receive our results July 30 so that I can submit the travel form. We fly into Exuma Aug 1 that’s only 3 days from receiving tests results. Is that going to be a problem? I thought as long as the test was within 10 days of travel we would be fine?
@ Jennifer K There is a section for your passport and passport number but there is also a section asking for Travel Insurance so I think it’s asking for both!
Delta has cancelled all Exuma flights until 12/18/20.
"@ Whitney Allen,They are asking for Travel Insurance Information, however you can submit your form without. The sections that have the asterisk next to it must be filled in."
"just got a email that my delta flight has been canceled on aug 3 , was able to get one through united ,, wait and see"
"According to whom? Re: delta blanket cancellationsEdited: 1:42 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"i got a email went on line to check and sure enough no flight , so i had travelocity check and yeap"
I get a little conflicting information. I chatted with www.bahamas.com and they said use this Form https://travel.gov.bs/internationalAnd your request will be expedited. The health ministry says use their form but also says you need five business days. We plan on doing both. The health ministry card looks a little different than the form above. It includes quarantine information and I was told to ignore that section. I’m nervous too. Since we are driving to Florida from Texas I’m anxious about getting halfway there and finding out we can’t fly or enter the Bahamas.
"Whitney- gotcha! I see what you mean about the insurance.Edited: 2:06 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"I wonder if it’s like AA did and cancelled some, but not all, and are just not allowing new bookings until everything settles down"
"i was able to get flights with united ,, the plane has a lot of blank seats ,"
Is this the reason for the delta Cancellation? https://news.delta.com/delta-operations-inte…
"Jennifer - looks like a cluster over at Delta...when it rains it pours....Whitney Allen - I am leaving in August also - don't despair, the rules/procedures will change 5 more times before we go. I would like to be optimistic but the Florida thing has my attention. Won't take much to close the doors again. Our locales are offering those free tests all the time...and they will become even more available as we go into the summer and fall. I am thinking about taking one mid-July, then double my PPE and sanitary efforts and avoid everyone until 10 days prior, and then get the test for the trip, and coast from there. But like I said, things could change, but the Sands (beer) and blue water are worth the trouble."
George- the Florida situation concerns me as well. We are only two weeks out and traveling the week they open. Our hope is they give it at least a couple of weeks before they shut down again. Bahamas that is. I think many will agree Florida nor Texas will shut down again. In it for the long haul.
Has anyone gotten any updates regarding the Delta cancellations? They are not taking any phone calls and are unreachable by message
I just logged into my american flight for july 4th and found i did not have a connecting flight from Miami to GGT. AA didn't notify me of the cancellation. Upon calling in it was confirmed that flight was cancelled and i'm eligible for a refund. very surprised that i wasn't notified.
"I just got my email from Delta, that they canceled my flight to GGT on Aug 16th. I want to book on American through Miami, but what if they cancel too! Ughhhh. It is definitely because Bahamas is requiring the neg covid test, these airlines don't want to be responsible if a customer has to be put back on the plane if they didn't get tested"
My husbands was just now canceled on delta. I don’t understand why it took so long for their system to update. I’m in the process of canceling everything. The testing situation in our area is just not reliable.
"You are having the same experience that we did. We are American Platinum Pro and didn't get notification either. They have so many cancellations, they aren't emailing you. We got reimbursed after about 10 days."
"Hi Jennifer,Delta's service into GGT from CLT, and a few other islands (MHH, ELH) is scheduled to resume December 2020, until further notice. Also, with American Airline, service from CLT to GGT is scheduled to resume December 2020, until further notice. Here are flight options that are scheduled to resume next month:American Airline- MIA/GGT service is scheduled to commence on July 7th on a daily basis using E-75 equipment with 76 seats.Silver Airways- FLL/GGT service is scheduled to commence on July 1st .Flying directly into NAS, and taking a direct flight to GGT using one of the the local carriers that provides DAILY flights.  ·"
"we are using silver airways from FLL to GGT both ways so we might be ok , thanks for the update"
American literally let me book the flight from CLT to GGT YESTERDAY!! This was after scrambling when Delta cancelled us. Just went in and changed the flight to go through Miami instead. Crossing my fingers this works!!!
"Cancelled my flight on Delta last Friday, received my refund yesterday."
I just got off of the phone with American. They said my flight through Charlotte in October is still active. Hope it stays that way.
"I am sure they (check-in counter, airline gate clerk, etc.) would require the negative test certificate before you even got on the plane - right?"
You never know! I would plan on submitting your results and bring a hard copy with you.
I'm scheduled to go to GGT on AA on 7/22. Just got an email from AA asking me to confirm the flight. Would guess it's going to be full - assuming they are letting Floridians into the country next month.
I received a call from AA tonight telling me about a schedule change for our July flight. It was just a few minutes either way but I asked them about the requirements that The Bahama's has regarding entry and being tested. She said she wasn't aware of it.I'm worried that people might be getting on a flight or showing at the airport without knowing what's going on!
"Wow, I imagine they are going to be many visitors denied entry because they are unaware of the testing regulations."
"Thank You Bahamas Out Islands, I think I will book AA out of MIA, I should be all set for coming home, as I booked Silver/Jet Blue to FLL. My cottage at Paradise Bay is waiting for me, and I don't want to disappoint!"
"So now according to the Prime Minister's address last night, the Covid 19 testing needs to be done not more than 7 days before entry to Bahamas. The new 7 days prior to travel goes into affect on July 7th, so if you travel before that the previous 10 days is still acceptable."
Planning on traveling to Exuma July 10th. I just called Department of Bahamas Immigration (242-322-7530 then option 5 for visitors) just to clarify the travel health form needed to submit after negative results received. The lady said you now have to have a negative Covid-19 test within 7 days of travel! She said the Prime Minister spoke yesterday and made an update. She said the response from the government website giving you clearance to travel is immediate. https://travel.gov.bs/international
"I just saw the testing was 7 days prior as well. So, after we submit that application with neg test results, we immediately are approved...no waiting, correct? That's how I understood it as well."
"That's going to be tough for most people in the States but completely understandable. In our area, they are now restricting tests to those that are showing symptoms."
The lady I spoke with said the response is immediate...she actually said “within 10 seconds”?!
When you call the number and press 5 is it silent until someone answers? My husband and kids were tested TODAY and we fly out on the 7th. UGH!!!
The response is immediate. We each submitted and an email popped up immediately.
@Rhonda P...someone answered right away.
I spoke to the Bahamas Ministry of Health and they said make sure to print out a hard copy as well.
"Holy Moly, this is cutting it quite close. That means you will need results quickly. I will do all that I have to do to get to the Out Islands of the Bahamas. Good Luck to all and safe travels!"
Double check but I read you can use a home testing kit especially LabCorp. I read that someone called the ministry of Tourism and they said it was ok.
"Wow, and it's not even July 1 yet....10 days, 7 days, ...whats next? However, I don't see how they could lessen the days any more than they are now and be accommodating; dunno... Next week is sure to be a hoot.Stay strong!"
"is there anything (article, webpage, literally anything) the bahamian gov has put in writing that states exactly which tests from which providers are accepted? planning on taking a quick trip to the cove from 24-28 july and any info around this would be appreciated."
"I am with a group of ten people flying to the Exumas on July 3rd...all have negative test results. I uploaded my family's test results to the Ministry of Health and received an immediate approval. The following day, the other two families that I'm travelling with tried to submit their applications and are being told it is under review and will take 24/48 hours for approval. Have any of you received a similar response? If so, how long did it take to receive approval? Thanks so much!"
"I uploaded my husband and kid’s negative reports today and received an immediate email that they are at “medium” risk and their health visas will need to be reviewed. They went on Monday when the website said if you arrived July1-7 your test results must be no more than 10 days old. If you arrive after July 7 your results must be no more than 7 days old. Then that evening the website changed to July 1-6 10 days and after July 6- test no more 7 days old. That may be why the delay- because their test is 8 days old. I don’t think where they went will test them again until 7 days have passed. I was tested today so I should be fine...Edited: 9:35 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"We are in the same boat. half the party is approved and ready, the other half medium risk. We are supposed to hop on a flight this afternoon. Does anybody know if this means that it's under review or if this means they are denied?"
I just read somewhere that there's a glitch that is causing some people to be medium risk. I'd suggest calling.
"After I posted my question, some members in my group started receiving their approvals. It seems to be taking ab out 12 hours to be approved. Good luck!"
Have you heard back from them?
Let me know how that turns out!
"We are scheduled to get tested Mon, a week before arrival. I'm thinking about getting tested Wed also in case we don't get results back can't get to Exuma for a couple of days!"
"I also saw somewhere, maybe FB, where the Minister of Health said to bring your negative test results and you could fill out the travel form when you arrived into the Bahamas. it would only make sense to allow that if you had the results in hand."
"well just got the dreaded email , untied just changed my flights , the problem is 1 of the connecting flight wont work so united gave me a full refund , i an done with this ,the lady wont give my money back on house thats a joke , something dont want me to go to exuma i give in , ant going"
Yes for sure you will need PRINTED test results. They were not happy that we only had the results on our phone.
Thanks for the update! I’m glad you were able to make it.
My husband got an email that he is low risk. Does this mean he is clear? IS that email his Visa?
"i cant find a trip from lex to ggt , if we wanted to spend the night at fll and go the next day , thats the only way , gee been waiting from feb on this trip"
Lilrobo65 - nothing out of Charlotte? Lex to Charlotte to GGT?
"you would thing it would show up , the trip i had , had me going through there"
New edited restrictions. https://www.bahamas.com/sites/default/files/…
"For those arriving after July 7th, test results can’t be older than 7 days."
I called the Ministry of Health yesterday because our COVID tests were done ten days out as originally stated. I told them there was no way to get retested in time and she told me they will approve it if you are within a few days. I sent in my husband's results and he was approved immediately. I actually called twice and talked to two different people and they said the same thing.
"I've spoken with them as well and they all have been very nice, helpful and have lots of patience!"
We are flying on the 9th and my husband tested on the 2nd and got negative results on the 3rd. We uploaded and filled out the travel visa and it said he has until July 11th to travel. I’m wondering if their system still gives the automatic 10 days of travel validity? I feel like testing on the 2nd is actually 8 days out but reading your responses helps me to feel better. Have a great 4th of July!
"This updated link says test within seven “working” days. I’m assuming working days is the same as business days and only Monday through Friday days count. And also Bahamian holidays would also not be working days. Anybody able to confirm that weekends and holidays don’t count?https://covid19.gov.bs/travel/Edited: 2:23 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"In Houston we have a place that gives results the same day. Seems lots of companies are using them for their employees that have to work off shore, etc. And yes it is the swab test."
Nice! I need to find a place like that in Dallas. What company?
On my previous comment and link it was pointed out to me on Facebook that the title says it’s for entering the country in June so that may be old news even though it is still on the govt website when you click on travel.
"I'm in Dallas too, would love to know what company you're using in Houston with such fast results!"
"@RayJen and @Lisetta S it's called Urgent Doc. They have one in Houston, Livingston, Lufkin and Nacogdoches. Nac isn't THAT far really."
Quick question about screening on arrival. Do we need to bring copies of our covid test for them to keep or do they just want to inspect a hard copy of our results? Thanks!
You should bring a hard copy as well as uploading them.
Thanks little John! Do they take and keep the results or give them back?
You do need to register online and then show them at immigration. It's my understanding that they are returned to you.Someone else had posted that they showed them on their phone and it was ok. Not preferred method but they allowed them entry. I wouldn't take chances though!
@littlejohn - Thanks for the info on the testing site. Do you mind if I ask which location in Houston you are using for same day results? I am actually thinking of flying Southwest to get the test done if I can have guaranteed same or next day results...everything in Dallas is 3-10 days turnaround.
"Oh, I see there is just the one location. Thanks again!"
Good luck!
Leaving Wednesday. Can anyone tell me their experience with paperwork and how difficult it was or wasn’t?
Clarify. How it was when you actually got there.
"its funny there was several flights before and none , the ones i did see thats was good was 3k maybe next year"
I got that as well and I am flying on 7/26.
look at AA mid aug and on i found some there
"Flew in today! You must have your Covid test printed out or at the very least on your phone. One couple did not and they were not allowed thru immigration.He kept saying that he was told that if he had the health Visa they would have his downloaded test results. They were frantically trying to call the doctor’s office that administered their test. We were passed thru before we found out what ended up happening. Also, they kept all of our test documentation and looked through it to make sure it was the RT-PCR test.Edited: 10:19 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"lilrobo65 - yeah, I saw those $3000 tickets...they were $590 about 3 weeks ago...I had to opt for early-mid August also after the July 15-20 trip I was monitoring for two months disappeared overnight....Good luck and keep working on it...Rhonda P - Thanks for the intel on the Covid test...Edited: 11:09 pm, July 07, 2020 "
@RhondaP thanks for the info!
"Rhonda, which test did you take? was it at a center or a take home one?"
"We had our tests done this morning and was negative! Whole process took 1.45 hours and when the testing place called, they said that if we had waited, they could have given us the paper results right then. So now just waiting for the email so we can submit online and should be good to go (literally)!"
which one did you take ?
Rhonda did you use one of the approved at home tests?
"I have been going to the Out Islands for over 15 years. It was hard not to go in my opinion. Not for the faint of heart during these times. I had a regular doctor appointment for the usual exam, I took the opportunity to inquire about testing for my trip mid-August. I was very relieved to hear I can use a script from him and bring to Lab Corp which is five minutes away and have results in 2-3 days. Well within the ""window"" allowed. I will absolutely be holding my breath until I have those results in my eager little hands. Silver already bumped me to an 8 o'clock flight from the afternoon and I have no choice but fly in the day before and spend the night in Florida. Not thrilled, but I'm doing it. Im bringing two childhood girlfriends and its not even surprise-able that we are willing to do this, bad ass catholic school chicks in fourth grade!!Good luck to all and thanks for all the information. We can just pray all is good to go!"
@Don K it was the nasal swab test.
No. We went to a drive thru testing center at our local hospital. We are a group of 8 and some of us got our results thru our patient portal in 3 days. 1 test didn’t come back until Monday and we flew out Tuesday at 6am. It was nerve racking but so worth it. Most everyone here is wear a mask. We ate at Santana’s today and didn’t have to wear one but we hand sanitized and we’re respectful of whatever they wanted us to do.
Just saw a new protocol update from the PM. Back to tests must be taken within 10 days of travel. It was posted on the Prime Minister Facebook page.
Please be careful:tribune242.com/news/…
Alert. My group made it to the Bahamas but the group coming with us did not. They got their covid test and when they went to get the health visa it stated they would be reviewed for 24-58 hours before granted access. So beware of that new change. This was yesterday. So they had to cancel. Also- we watched them put someone back on the plane because results did not state the type of test and the lab name. Make sure results have all information.
"We just took our tests today and will get results and upload them to the site asap,I'm not waiting for crap once I have the test uploaded so I hope they're ready for drama down there!"
Drama won't get you very far with immigration officials. It will probably get you sent back to the plane. Today is Independence Day in the Bahamas so expect delays.
I uploaded my negative results and it said not approved. I freaked because my husbands came back immediately and his was approved. The instant message said mine was under review and I would get another email in 24-48 hours it took me 2 hours to get through to Ministry of Health (242-502-0829) and I spoke with Reagan Marshall (she was amazing) and she approved it and sent me an email immediately. Be patient and be nice! Drama and or confrontation gets you no where... EVER...and especially not in Exuma!
Not if we are approved then have issues at the airport!
"@littlejohn Do you know if this was a RT PCR test? My husband and I did a rapid covid test yesterday. It´s not the RT PCR but a NAAT molecular test. They told us upfront it was an PCR one but found out afterwards they gave us the wrong info :( It is confusing because when they ask duing the Travel HealthVisa application for what test type you did the options are anti gen, anti body and it then says RT PCR (including NAA, NAAT, TMA, RNA) and that makes me wonder if these test types in () is also approved. Anyone knows? We are supposed to travel the 16th and pretty nervous if it will work out."
"Ours was the Quidel Sofia 2 SARS COVID-19 Antigen Test.I submitted the results online and they were accepted.As far as the other stuff, I REALLY don't know about different tests, etc."
"@LittleJohn: the Quidel COVID Antigen test is an antigen test, not a PCR test. They may have accepted in error, but it does not comply with the requirements/guidance. In fact, the Health Visa application website specifically states: Currently, The Bahamas currently DOES NOT accept Rapid Antigen or Antibody (IgG/IgM).The reason the requirement specifies PCR tests is that they are more sensitive (ie less likely to return a ""negative"" result when a person is actually infected). Given the impact that introduction of COVID19 would have on the Bahamas (and especially Exuma), the rationale for using the most sensitive test available is obvious. It's likely the approval was in error. I'm aware of individuals being turned around in GGT earlier this week, so they are certainly making an effort to enforce the rules.Please everyone, get the right test, and keep yourself - and more importantly the island - (as) safe (as possible) and prevent a repeat shutdown.The following text is from the Quidel Fact Sheet:What does it mean if the specimen tests negative forthe virus that causes COVID-19?A negative test result for this test means that antigensfrom SARS-CoV-2 were not present in the specimenabove the limit of detection. However, a negative testresult does not rule out COVID-19 and should not beused as the sole basis for treatment or patientmanagement decisions, including infection controldecisions. ***Antigen tests are known to be less sensitivethan molecular tests that detect viral nucleic acids.[eg. an RT-PCR TEST// my addition]***Therefore, negative results should be treated aspresumptive and confirmed with a molecular assay, ifnecessary for patient management."

@jonsey. NAAT = nucleic acid amplification test = RT-PCR test (which amplifies nucleic acids/ie RNA).Your test should be compliant.Have a great + safe trip!
"Please everyone show your doctor or lab the requirements and get the appropriately required test. Granted, you might slip through customs with the wrong test. So might COVID..."
"Yea, I don't really know what all that means but we asked our RN/PA/DR about the test, got it done, submitted the results, received our health visa. We aren't going to circumvent any requirements and if we aren't allowed entry so be it. We can stay in FLA, get the test then travel.If we have to come home and are out the rental, it is what it is. Not the immigration dept fault, not the property owner's fault."
Thank you so much @Davesto5 This was very helpful in calming my nerves :)
Leaving Exuma tomorrow. Does anyone know how long getting through the airport will take? They told us get there three hours early. Seems like a long time to me.
"Definitely not 3 hours. 1 1/2 hours (and that is even being cautious) is plenty. With fewer people on planes it will take even less time to checkin and go through security. The waiting area, once through security, is very small...we usually checkin and go across the street to Kermits and grab one last Kalik and then go through security within 30 minutes of departure."
PCR is fine.........
"Just got the bomb dropped on my August 5 -10 trip by Expedia - American Airlines canceled the flights. WTF? I called Expedia and AA and nobody could tell me why... I did reschedule for Aug 7-12 and was charged $226 more for main cabin - no economy coach available; and the plane to and from GGT is smaller (CRJ145). We will see if they cancel this one too...anybody else getting the same notifications for early August?Edited: 7:26 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"I recently noticed our Delta flight near the end of February 2021 disappeared. Just the segment from ATL to GGT. So, hope to resolve that, but it could change 10 times by then. I must admit the airlines are having a rough time and completely understand..."
"Either they know something we don't, or they actually are cutting back...I just don't see that since these GGT flights always look full (even when checking seating well before the flight) and everyone wants to get away from it all. Just kind of surprised they would cancel when I'm usually worried they are sold out and won't get a seat...Delta no better it seems; although you can still go United/Bahamas Air if you are willing to go 2 stops and take 12 hours..."
So we showed in Exuma today and they said our test results needed to be 'adjusted'. The testing place we went to wouldn't make any adjustments so we flew back home and will hope another flight out in the next couple of days I think.
"We had our AA flights booked Dfw to FLL and enough time to make it to FXE to fly makers air to staniel cay. American cancelled ALL morning flights and now we will either have to push this trip out to next year or risk flying into Florida, finding a hotel and staying the night to make the makers flight. I’m not exactly thrilled by spending the night in a hotel in Florida due to the absurd increase in cases. Makers wants $5k for one way charter. I just can’t justify that. I suspect we might be one of the few already on that flight - we literally are the only guests on fowl cay that week. What would you do? I need to decide pretty quickly. I just don’t know what to do."
"Sorry, LJ, I just don't see how they can even let you leave the States if you are not a ""green light"" to go into the islands. Sounds like an altogether clustered mess, and given my daily review of the Bahamas newspaper sites, I can definitely see why this happens. Can you explain what the ""adjustment"" needed was?TXtravelinmom7: That's crazy money. Unless you got the jones bad for this trip, you should consider not going. But if you gotta get there, a night in FLA sounds daunting, but how is that any more dangerous than having to walk through FFL to get to your plane anyway?"
"Sorry to hear Littlejohn. It sounds like growing pains in the health visa program, but quickly evolved to now involve manual review of the uploaded tests to confirm PCR before greenlight. The earlier instant approvals were based obviously on applicants checking the PCR box. There was a story in the news about some travellers who arrived with antigen test but were let in, then subsequently flaunted the closed beach rules over their independence day weekend (and filmed doing so). Obviously this raised a lot of scrutiny locally. Story today says 100 ppl have been turned around. Hopefully this will decrease with more explicit info in the application website, manual review of the applications before greenlight, and ideally confirmation of this by the airlines prior to departure. What was AA's take on the situation - I guess no issues with space on the return flight. Did they make you pay?Hope you can get the PCR test and sort things out."
"Immigration was REALLY nice, only problem is that Kermit's was out of Sands!Obviously there's a website data input issue and then clarification on how the wording should be on the results with some of the labs/results. All would have been ok if our place would have worked with immigration.American was no problem but didn't have space in first for the return flight."
"I believe the people traveling have the ultimate responsibility to make sure they know the requirements when traveling and have the proper documentation--not the airlines. The airlines transport people of all nationalities and can't be responsible for that amount of current info and enforce it. Same with cruise ships. I've seen many people not allowed off the ship in certain ports due to documentation issues. Unfortunately, things are a hot mess now, and it will take awhile for issues to be sorted out. We are holding off to 2021--hopefully.Edited: 8:14 am, July 14, 2020 "
"I just checked Delta's Contract of Carriage. Rule 16 covers the info I referred to above. ""Carrier not liable"" etc, etc, etc. Same with all airlines and other travel related modes of transportation."
I would be curious to see what LJ’s paperwork looked like vs those who have been allowed in. We are getting our tests next week & wanting to make sure I have everything in place.
"Yes, definitely....I mean, if my damn printed test says ""negative"" and it was a PCR, or whatever the nomenclature de jour required, coupled with an approved health screen, that should be the good-to-go green light needed. Sounds like a disconnect somewhere...."
Ours had way too much wording on it! It mentioned all the other types of tests that can be done and immigration didn't like that. Immigration was on the phone with the testing place and we couldn't get the testing place to make changes.
"@george - if you have a negative PCR test and the appropriate visa with no symptoms I am sure you will be approved. However, it seems they are now manually renewing the uploaded documentation, rather than just accepting the ""checkbox"" that the applicant clicks saying it's a PCR test.As LittleJohn stated previously, he had an ANTIGEN test. These tests are specifically not accepted.The three types of tests are :1 - ANTIGEN test. This is a quick test that detects viral particles. IT IS NOT CURRENTLY ACCEPTED.2 - ANTIBODY test (serology). This is a test to see if you have antibodies, which imply PRIOR infection and immunity (however many tests are inaccurate. IT IS NOT CURRENTLY ACCEPTED3 - PCR test (also called RT-PCR, q-PCR, Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). This detects the viral RNA/genetic material. It is the most sensitive test, and the gold standard for acute infection. THIS IS THE TEST THAT IS REQUIRED.This information is provided without warranty and you should verify its accuracy! Check with your doctor or lab/pharmacy, but hopefully this knowledge will help people steer to right test.Also, note that the situation evolves. This information as far as I know is accurate as of today.Safe travels.(ps the lab will never make changes to the wording in the report. The report is part of the laboratory approval and subject to laboratory regulatory authorities etc).Edited: 6:41 pm, July 14, 2020 "
I meant they are REVIEWING the submitted documents before approval (not renewing).
"Walmart does the pcr test from etruenorth,we just got approved yesterday from the tourism ministry! I will tell you my test did not say pcr on it and was not accepted until I went online and printed off an article about which testing they did and it said the pcr and the bahamas accepted that article with my test results...Edited: 12:02 pm, July 15, 2020 "
Ryanboz7 - how long did it take for your results to come back? We did ours through etruenorth and they told me 3-5 days but I’m starting to get nervous.
"I’m kind of nervous because I have a flight with American Airlines for September 8th and it’s saying my flight has changed, but doesn’t say what’s changed about it. It just says check back soon to see what’s changed. I’m going to call in the morning to see what they say about my flight."
"@Jessica Please be patient as the airlines are changing their flights and adjusting their schedules to accommodate the changing world.I expect that your flight will still happen that day provided borders are still open, etc."
"So if anyone cares about our travel situation:We flew United IAH to NAS Thurs and had about 10-12 people on the plane. First had 4 people with seats for 16!Immigration in NAS was easy and VERY empty. Our visa was APPROVED on Wed but because we had been turned away in Exuma on Mon, the officer did go speak to a supervisor. After a few anxious moments, we were granted entry!Several hours wait in NAS for Bahamasair flight and BAM we are in Exuma!"
"i talked to AA yesterday and she said all was good everything had been on time , i hope ours stays that way"
"@littlejohn, so happy you made it to paradise!! Enjoy my friend. Give my love to Nancy."
Thanks Roe and we are looking forward to seeing Michael. We are at Feb Pt till Wed then move to Palm Bay almost next door.
Thanks for the update! I am scheduled to fly out of IAH in July 30. Fingers crossed For testing and health visa in time.
"Jesica:It may be just a time adjustment. If its canceled, its going to say canceled. We had our flight on August 5 canceled, but I think it was because AA canceled one of its daily flights out of MIA to GGT. We scrambled and with help from our very friendly Expedia travel agent (the guy from India), 2 hours later we got another flight on the 7th. I noticed that the plane has been downsized too; 50 seats v. 76 like they flew last year. Stay hopeful; we still got figures crossed with 20 days out (and dreading the Covid test rigormarole).Edited: 9:38 pm, July 17, 2020 "
I called AA and they told me the flight was just pushed back 30 minutes! So fingers crossed. We are leaving the 8th of September. So we plan to do our test the Tuesday before and then proceed with the visa. So 7 days after the test we’ll arrive. Hopefully this gives the visas plenty of time to be approved.
They eliminated all early flights. That has been my biggest hurdle. Still trying to figure out what to do
"Jesica- the timeframe to get your Covid test is now 10 days out. So, I would try and do your test closer to 10 days out if I were you. CVS does the PCR test and they are free....you can schedule your drive up test on their website. As of right now, my local one has available appointments 4 days out from now."
"we are flying AA also i haven't got a email mail yet , we are arriving there at 12:30 or so ,just checked ours and all good thanks or the heads upEdited: 7:30 am, July 19, 2020 "
Little John! Can you just stay there? How’s that going to go down with the borders shutting again!? I can’t think of a better place to be stranded!
"They are shutting down airline travel to / from the US Wednesday the 22nd midnight. Until then, flights will be coming in empty with only outbound passengers allowed. This was in PM Minnis' weekly address given today at 5pm est."
"I'm pretty sure the PM address said no commercial flights into the Bahamas after midnight on Wednesday the 22, but it did say commercial flights are allowed to depart from the Bahamas, except Grand Bahama.Here's an excerpt pertaining to travel from the recap on the Facebook page of the Office of the PMHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE PRIME MINISTER’S NATIONAL ADDRESS 19 JULY 2020-The Ministry of Health reporting 15 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 today, bringing total to 153.-International commercial flights NOT permitted to enter, except for flights from the UK, European Union and Canada, effective midnight Wednesday 22 July-Bahamasair to cease outgoing flights to the US, effective immediately-Outgoing commercial vessels and flights still allowed to depart The Bahamas, except Grand Bahama-Private aviation and pleasure craft and yachts still permitted to enter and depart The Bahamas"
"wel i guess it wasnt meant to be , i have tried 4 times to get to exuma , i get the hint ill go somewhere else"
lilrobo65 - you have been a trooper this whole time - Sorry they pulled it out from under ya again.
"thanks the sad part the lady wont give our deposit back on house , we lost half, ohh , i am looking into somewhere else ,, i need to get away"
Dang we were leaving Friday. All tests cleared. No wonder we only got 1/4 approved today. Hopefully the people we booked through will work with us on a refund or credit.
So is this for all out islands?!!
Read This.......PM Announces International Travel Restrictionstribune242.com/news/…
@lilrobo I feel the same way. I’ve started to look into other areas.
So if we are chattering a plane from Fort Lauderdale does that count as commercial??
Very disappointing! We got all our tests done this week and submitted for health visa. Was going to leave Friday as well. Hope silver airways will refund our trip cost
They just cancelled all USA commercial flights starting Wednesday. Can we charter in?
What are other options besides Mexico ?

"i find it more and more peculiar that counties are willing to open to other counties that clearly have lower testing standards just bc their “advertised” positivity rate or numbers are lower.this is not to say that the US has handled the situation well, cuz we haven’t. but at least we have mass testing and have a good gauge of what the situation is like. it’s so easy to say that you have a decline in positivity rate when you only perform tests on symptomatic people (@ europe). i argue that it is just as risky to let them in as it is to let americans in. this picking and choosing to open to select countries based on arbitrary statistics/parameters/metrics is silly, especially when they are not compra me because countries have different sizes, and administer tests based on different criteria. you either stay closed to everyone or take the plunge and open. in my opinion, this just makes it look unprofessional."
We are flying FXE to staniel cay and will be at fowl cay.
"Anyone going to Georgetown/Exuma on Sunday, August 2nd and looking to share a charter flight/boat charter? We are looking for someone who can take us from Fort Lauderdale is anyone knows anyone? (with COVID negative test in hand of course)"

"Of course this is easy for me to say but...We are here now and had to stay inside because of the weather and today isn't looking any better. There is a low pressure developing over The Bahamas so not much in the way of outdoor activities planned for us right now. We even missed the ;pig roast yesterday!Bein g here in this weather is still way better than being at home and if we are locked down here, then we must do our part to keep people safe."
"Directly from the PM's transcript: ""Private international flights and charters for Bahamians, residents and visitors will be permitted. Pleasure craft and yachts will also be permitted."""
"i understand no flights fro US and they are taking flights from Canada , now cany we go through Canada to get to GGT ?"
be careful all US flights are Banned from entering the bahamas due to the out of control virus in the states.
if your carrying a US passport you will be refused entry. Also being American you cannot pass through Canada as you are also denied entry.
"private chartered boat or plane.Edited: 5:27 pm, July 20, 2020 "
I think you can thank the state of Florida for that as they are only a quick flight away and their handling of the virus is not the best.
"Lynntodd - Miami Air Charters does flights, check with them to see if they have any scheduled, I think they do have one to Long Island on the 5th of August. They will sell seats on the deadhead routes, and can fly to any island. Private charter is OK, with visa and tests. Tropix air is another one. Ask them about deadhead seats maybe you can figure something out rather than a personal charter."
"This saga goes way beyond the state of Florida and Texas , this is all down to the current US administration's inept handling of the crises, it's like they are going out of their way to make it worse , quite extraordinary really.Edited: 7:16 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Confirmation from makers air, we are considered private. The trip is still a go."
"Well Tex, good luck to you - I hope it works out. In other news, Bermuda is so regulated that it scares me to even think of going there. St. Martin not much better, so I guess I'm just too tired to fight it now. Hopefully the end of October works out but I don't think folks are going to stand for Minnis switching gears every month, so until we get a vaccine, it looks iffy at least until 2021. I really got the Jones for getting away. Has anyone else considered a boat in their future?"
are they expensive ? makers air
"George5th, Pretty sure Saint Martin is closed to all US flights until August 1st, I had thoughts of returning to Anguilla but like yourself have given up on that idea, I'll have a look at how the land lies in Sept for an island visit of some sort, it's definitely disappointing but necessary to keep the virus out ."
I was under the impression that you can charter a private plane or boat and go? Even if you were a US citizen?.... am I wrong? I have my trip is September 8th and I’m hoping I don’t have to cancel it
"Jessica, yes. The Bahamas are open to US Citizens who charter a private plane, and also to private vessels. Closed to Commercial tourism. It’s a roll back to the mid June soft opening, basically. Less tourists, more tracing and accountability(and in my opinion a more respectful, hopefully, group of tourists)."
"#311>>and in my opinion a more respectful, hopefully, group of tourists)>>Why? Because they are wealthier than the average Joe who saves all year to spend a week at Atlantis or Baha Mar? What makes the charter/private yacht folks more ""respectful""? Have you ever watched Below Deck? LOL! Inquiring minds want to know."
@312 must agree that statement really seems off !!!
"You know, I regretted saying that after I wrote it. But I’ll own up. I was referring to the ones who were coming in, and complaining about wearing masks because “they came here to get away from that” and the ones who disobeyed the closed beach orders because they wanted to go to the beach. I’m sure most of you, and especially the ones who love and care about the out islands and their people, have been respectful. I appologize."
@314 thanks...understood.
"just talked to a charter service and he said that this should be over i a few weeks , out trip is aug 20 i am going to go through with things getting test on or about the 10 or 11 th by then we should see whats going on if not open by the 10th or so ill redo my trip , but he acted like this closer would be very long ,  wait and see"
"The first 2 cases of Covid have been confirmed on Cat island and according to the article they were not travel related so it was brought onto the island. It's unlikely this will be over in a few weeks tribune242.com/news/…Edited: 4:54 pm, July 21, 2020 "
@316 how would a charter service know anything about the situation of the covid pandemic and that it would be over in a few weeks. Come on.
"he said he thought it be over in a few weeks , i dont mind waiting and seeing , nothing else to do and i cant get money back on house all i have to to wait well see i guess"
"You are wise to consider departure and come back again when things are more certain and safer. As you may know, there were 2 cases in Cat Island today -- they were flown to Nassau for medical attention, as there are no health facilities on that island. In fact, there are few medical facilities available on most out islands -- including Exuma. And Nassau has only 46 hospital beds for COVID-19 cases. So it would not take much to overwhelm the limited medical facilities. Americans who get sick here will have to pay up-front for medical care, as most insurance isn't accepted here, or pay for very expensive medical evacuation flights.For those being cavalier about travelling to the Bahamas, you'd do well to do your research before coming. We have nearly 100 new cases in GB in the past 20 days (since the borders opened) -- keeping in mind that our prior total count was 103 cases for the prior 3 1/2 months. Grand Bahama is now in full lockdown -- no flights in or out -- for the next 14 days. All it will take is a few cases in the out islands and they too will be locked down -- meaning that if you're there, you'll be there (at your own expense) for the lockdown period. For some, that may sound like paradise, but I can't imagine getting ill on an out island in a foreign country with little or no medical assistance.And how on earth can a foreign charter company be a reliable source of information on what is happening in the Bahamas? All it's going to take is a few cases to show up on Exuma or Eleuthera and they too will be locked down. And likely the ""loophole"" of private charters and vessels will be ceased too. So, this is very much a ""wait and see"" situation that is literally changing day to day. As it stands now, we are awaiting the effects from 2 weeks ago -- and we're already seeing cases out of control in Grand Bahama within 6 days or open borders. We've got 15 days to chew our fingernails wondering which other islands have been infected.Edited: 8:25 pm, July 21, 2020 "
RT from FXE to staniel cay for 2 was 12k
I think at this point I might just cancel my trip altogether. There’s no way for my boyfriend to change his vacation days for work. And I just don’t believe exuma will be open in September
"I'm somewhat surprised people are still considering trying to make a trip in the coming months. There seems to be a disconnect in the message the Bahamians are sending and what Americans are hearing.They are closing borders, completely shutting down travel to/from some islands based off 2 hospitalizations, enforcing masks with fines, requiring difficult to obtain tests prior to travel, etc. To me, it seems the Bahamian government is trying to do everything in their power to eradicate the virus. Not flatten a curve or reduce the transmission. But, flat out get rid of it. And, that's their prerogative and likely what they feel is best for them based on their circumstances.But, it seems like people on here are trying to ignore that message and find a narrow window or loophole around the laws in order to plan or make a vacation. And, perhaps I'm wrong, but when I hear the Bahamian govt say they're not allowing commercial flights into the country from America, my initial thought was they don't want Americans there and that should be respected. It was not well maybe I can hop on a boat and float on over or get Billy from Backwoods Flying to get me in on a puddle jumper. No judgement, it actually sounds kind of fun to do those things and in the back of my mind they're really pretty brilliant ideas to outwit or circumvent a government that leaves things somewhat open. But, it's not the American govt, and, given the state of the world, their rules, even if somewhat confusing, should probably be taken at face value and not taken advantage of. And, yes, sunk costs suck. No disagreement. Hope that didn't come off as lecture like, just a general observation."
I enjoyed the lecture Ben K :). Well said
"Well we are the only guests on the island, don’t plan on visiting anything on in other island that remotely includes people. We have our own boat, flying in private and just plan to relax. I can see this lecture applying to larger more inhabited islands, and I agree. However considering it will be just us, and I get tested regularly due to being in healthcare, if I don’t take this break (which has been booked since January and postponed twice), I might as well find myself a nice padded room because I’m beyond burned out."
Txtravelinmom - thank you for all you and your fellow healthcare workers do. Enjoy your solitude ☀️
"Ben K, well said for the most part. Here's the main thing -- we DO NOT have the luxury of having hospitals with hundreds of beds, medical staff that we can transfer from state to state as needed, nor an endless supply of medicine and ventilators - as in many developed countries. While some places have the luxury of ""flattening the curve"", our only real option is to try and eradicate the virus from our shores -- which we essentially did for some 45 days prior to the reopening of our borders on July 1st. Obviously, it's a balancing act, as our economy relies on tourism, but in less than 20 days of our borders being reopened, our jump in cases is nearly the same number in those few days as we've had in the prior 3 1/2 months. And as most of you know, we have little to no medical facilities on most of the out islands. Even a handful of cases would be a major health risk for us. And we have a grand total of 46 hospital beds available in Nassau (and ZERO on the out islands) It would not take much to overwhelm our health system. So, for those of you who claim to love the out islands, why can't you understnad the necessity of us needing to keep ourselves safe? Why are you so hell-bent on getting to the islands no matter what? If you love the islands, please let us stay safe. Even the US is recommending that US citizens not undertake non-essential travel. Vacation is not essential travel."
"Excellent and informative posts Dusty and Ben K ,"
"Well said Ben.I think people need to understand that the overwhelming majority of Americans don't have the 'virus' and are taking major precautions to avoid possibilities. Yes I know there are no guarantees, etc, etc.I'm sorry that people were coming into The Bahamas under false pretenses/tests and not taking the necessary precautions but that doesn't mean that everyone is.Our friends that LIVE on Exuma are fine with visitors coming that are doing the rights things."
"Littlejohn, so you keep saying, but how do you know who has and who doesn't have the virus? Do you have some magical powers the rest of the world doesn't? If so, your talents are being wasted in Exuma. The point is that anyone can have COVID-19. That you've tested 10 days ago only means that 10 days ago you didn't have it. How do you know you weren't infected on the flight down -- maybe even by someone who falsified their test? Pure and simple, you don't know, so stop with that ""song and dance"" Did you hear that there are now cases in Abaco? One was airlifted to Nassau in serious condition and is now hospitalised. Our 46 beds are now down to 41 left ... and with rising cases, are you sure there's going to be a bed for you or your family member if the unthinkable happens? So now there are active cases in New Providence, Grand Bahama, Bimini, Abaco, Cat Island and Inagua. Not looking good for the odds at this point for the other islands."
"Txtravelinmom Y’all enjoy. We were on fowl cay 5 years ago right now for our 10th anniversary and it is paradise. Having it all to yourself sounds even better. We were supposed to be on great Exuma right now but canceled because of everything going on. Wish we were there!Edited: 4:29 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"The point that many who are posting on this forum seem to be missing and as Dusty has established is how volatile The Out Islands are from a medical perspective , anyone coming from areas that have high infection rates example Texas, Florida, even if they follow the protocols the fact that traveling from an infected area through airports etc, is going to put the islands at high risk, that's not fiction it is now fact with 4 Out Islands now having Cases of Covid"
"A BAHAMIAN contractor and Mexican construction worker at the Baker’s Bay property in Abaco have allegedly tested positive for COVID-19, now tell me how a mexican worker gets to the island , i know here in US the cross the border ,even here i am we have H2A workers ,but on the island , dont understand"
"Inagua? Wow, that is a surprise. That is not a place most people venture to."
Stay SAFE littlejohn...This couple from Katy rescheduled for next September...
Thanks! We are good and changed our flight to Sunday cause of the storm in the gulf. Next flight wasn't till Wednesday which I couldn't talk her into!
Littlejohn - what airline are you flying? We were supposed to fly out Saturday and our flight was just cancelled.
We fly Bahamasair Exuma to Nassau in the morning then United later that afternoon. Land in Houston about 5-6 I think.
"United has flights Sat, Sun, Wed and Thurs currently until they change their schedule!"
"I thought all outgoing flights by Bahamasair to the US were cancelled.,HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE PRIME MINISTER’S NATIONAL ADDRESS 19 JULY 2020-The Ministry of Health reporting 15 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 today, bringing total to 153.-International commercial flights NOT permitted to enter, except for flights from the UK, European Union and Canada, effective midnight Wednesday 22 July-Bahamasair to cease outgoing flights to the US, effective immediately-Outgoing commercial vessels and flights still allowed to depart The Bahamas, except Grand Bahama-Private aviation and pleasure craft and yachts still permitted to enter and depart The Bahamas ."
"@SWNova, yes, Bahamas Air can't fly to US, but LJ is flying to Nassua then on United from there.We are currently here, our American flight out of GGT was cancelled for today, we chartered in to Staniel Cay yesterday in case we needed to get out quickly via Makers Air to FXE in Fort Lauderdale. We also have a guy here in Staniel Cay on notice who will fly us back to GGT directly if we are able to secure a flight out of GGT."

"@Christina R How much for 2 people on charter?Edited: 1:07 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"lilrobo, if you did your research, you would have discovered the following --1. The Bahamian contractor normally lives in Grand Bahama. He had recently travelled to the US (Florida) and returned to GB without having to have a negative test (72 hour rule) 2. The Mexican worker arrived in the Bahamas (along with a crew of a dozen or so skilled workers from Mexico) on July 3. They had all been tested negative prior to departure. They are all here legally and on Bahamas government work permits, so your insinuation of how they got there is more a reflection on your attitude than the facts. 3. Both the Bahamian contractor and Mexican construction worker are at Baker's Bay -- which is filled with high net worth individuals from many countries -- though predominantly Americans. Though it's unlkely they would come into close proximity with the workers, there's always a chance for further community spread. So something to watch closely. 4. All of these cases date back to the so-called ""soft opening"" or within the first few days of border opening on July 1. What we have today won't be seen until 2-3 weeks from now, so we have 2-3 weeks to see the effects of having our borders open. So, if you arrived on June 22 (the last day before closing to commercial flights), you've got 2-3 weeks to find out if you or people you came into contact with test positive or get ill. That's not a very comforting feeling for most of us. There is a 6pm update from the Ministry of Health today. With a holiday weekend coming up and surging number of cases on islands who've yet to see any cases in the past 4 moths, I'll bet there will be new restrictions coming up. Stay tuned."
"I have been following this post since the beginning (we were supposed to be there now) and I am shocked at how many are still trying to find a way in even though the government says don't come. I know we all need a break from our routine and shut in life we are now living, but please put the people of Exuma above your own needs. If you take the virus to this island it could be tragic for them. Have you ever been there? There are no facilities on the island to take care of the people you could be infecting. Is it so bad to wait until next year? And we wonder why we are called selfish here in America."
"Misbake maybe now this may put people off travellinghttps://ewnews.com/govt-pulls-back-on-commer…Edited: 2:57 pm, July 24, 2020 "
I hope so. I had to cancel my trip to Italy in April and Exuma this month so I know everyone's pain. But I will wait until it is safe for me and for those I come in contact with before I travel internationally.
"Yep...gotta redirect dreams and aspirations for now. Good time to double down on work, focus on work, and make more spending money for when they really open back up... I'm sure Triphene at the Krusty Crab, Shirley, and the others will need us more than ever down the road."
Word here is that Bahamas will be locked down again starting tonight at 7 through Monday. Guess we might have to stay a few more days and a few more days and a few more days...
"Just in -- 5pm, Friday, July 24. Full lockdown in the ENTIRE Bahamas -- every island. Beginning 10pm Friday evening through Monday 5am. That means, you stay where you are -- no leaving islands, no going out, no going from island to island. In your hotel, rental or where you are staying from 10pm tonight until 5am Monday morning. You do not leave for any reason unless it's an emergency or you are an essential worker. More details to be announced at 6pm during the Ministry of Health update."
We are here now. Our flights for tomorrow were cancelled and we are now trying to fly out Sunday. It was my understanding that grocery stores and gas stations would be open? Flights off the island seem to be dwindling.
"#350 -- CORRECTION Apparently, grocery stores, pharmacies, water depots, gas stations will be open to the public from 7am to 5pm. Kind of defeats the purpose of a lockdown, as everyone will be out and about anyway, but...More to be announced at 6pm by the Ministry of Health and the PM."
"Dusty, please keep us advised. Sounds like an interesting scenario. I wonder how tourists in the islands now will be handled???"
"i am getting word that international fights are coming but have to quarantine for 14 days ,is this true ?"
"Yes, all commercial international flights, no matter the country of origin of passengers, are subject to a 14 day quarantine on arrival. At the end of the quarantine, a mandatory molecular swab test is done, and only on a negative result, si the passenger allowed to go. This does not change the current rules for private air and sea charters. Those rules remain in place -- subject to the same restrictions. In addition to the nationwide weekend lockdown (from 10pm Friday to 5am Monday), other restrictions are as follows -- The current Emergency Orders (General) have been extended until September 30. As of Monday,, July 27, businesses can remain open with the exception of that no indoor or outdoor dining will be permitted. Takeout and delivery is permitted. There are also to be no public gatherings -- social events, church, sporting events, etc. A maximum of 5 persons are permitted for funerals or weddings. Curfew will also go into effect (all islands, except Grand Bahama, which is currently in full lockdown) from 7pm to 5am from Monday onwards. This means you must remain in your residence, hotel, rental, vessel, etc. from 7pm until 5am unless you have an emergency. All businesses must be closed by 6pm so staff have time to get home. As of Tuesday, domestic or inter-island travel by sea or air will cease. This could last for some time, so be sure you're where you need/want to be by this time or you will be required to stay put for the duration. That's the main gist of things -- subject to change, of course -- depending on how well we do and can follow the rules. The PM has said that he may lift restrictions on specific islands as warranted, but for now, these restrictions apply to all islands."
So sad but finally departing tomorrow. Word on Exuma that another lock down is coming and will be for 2 weeks. People are expecting it to start this weekend.
Ok I was told this doesn’t apply to private aircraft or boats? Are you saying if we fly to a private island on a private plane that we are not allowed to use private boat to see places such as big major cay?
"Two more cases today in Exuma (assuming Great Exuma) and 40 overall in the Bahamas. :(Today we postponed our end of October trip (which had already been postponed from April) to May of next year.Edited: 7:00 pm, July 27, 2020 "
"I would see what the order actually says.Charters are currently allowed, but commercial flights were allowed before and now are not.Things change weekly in different countries as they think what is best."
We were finally able to fly out last night after 3 cancelled flights in a row (Silver Air is the worst). The island definitely felt a shift late in the week. It was hard to find a place to eat. I pray they can lockdown and keep new cases at bay. The locals there were some of the best we’ve ever experienced.
"Little John, I would love to read a trip report from you if you have time to post one!"
"I'll see if I can remember everything! We usually do the same things like beaches and places to eat. We are creatures of habit. A usual day for us is in the boat, find a beach, drink beer, look for wildlife, explore trails have lunch and repeat!Because you asked so nice, I'll put something together!"
"It's an ever changing situation and now looks like the charter and boating option loophole has been closed too.tribune242.com/news/…Edited: 10:53 am, July 28, 2020 "
"@txtravel I would consider this a lucky break. Incoming hurricane/TS, expanding pandemic, lockdown..."
FYI it’s not an all inclusive restriction. We can still go. But I’m thinking it best to cx and r/s as we will only be able to use the boat to explore uninhabited islands.
We cancelled. Will try for r/s #4 next year. I can’t use PTO in Q4 at work. Ugh. I desperately needed this vacation.
@Davesto5 - I think you are right...been trying all year to get there - maybe too hard. Let's let it cool off for a couple of months and try again. We were supposed to be there next week; a TS or hurricane would have been the icing on the cake for this year's misery. Hope they don't get hit too hard. I at least hope the U.S. Sailboat show in Annapolis is still on...
"so whats the latest on opening back up ? i l know its still early--- just saw this Nationwide lockdown in effect until August 19Edited: 6:28 am, August 05, 2020 "

"Your best source of info would be the Prime Minister, since that is where the opening would first be announced. You can follow him on facebook, he gives (almost) daily updates. https://www.facebook.com/opmbs"

"Just watched the PM from yesterday at 5 pm. Sounds very optimistic. If you get a chance scroll over to the 1 hr 15 min mark of the presentation; he seemed to be prepping the welcome back by stressing that the resurgence wasn't the tourists fault...he also stated in the news that ""a revised, detailed, phased reopening plan is being worked on."""
did he seem like visitors will be coming back ?
"seems like for a while there the room was a jumping ,,now all quite ,"
So I'm hearing that the PM will announce Sunday on allowing visitors again and that should happen within 2 weeks of that.No promises!
thanks little john
