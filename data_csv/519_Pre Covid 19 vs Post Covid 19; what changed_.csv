"If you visited Vegas Post Covid 19, what are the major differences you see?Such as Aria buffet not opened. I love seafood buffet so that would be one good reason why I might hold my trip until things open back up."
"I visited in late June which is a totally different experience than early July to now. That being said as of now. Masks. No bars. No shows. Several shops and restaurants closed. Several major casinos closed. Limited room service. Limited hours for shopping and dining. Plexiglass dividers. Temp checks. Funny enough in many hotels, worse housekeeping standards. A more rough crowd. Apparently significant pot use in the hotels."
"There is no “ Post “ Covid. “ Post” means “ after”.The pandemic continues.There are numerous reports right here on the first page or two about people’s experience with visiting after the casinos reopend.Edited: 12:32 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"I agree with Irish. Similar to when people say, ""there will be a second wave of COVID-19."" Lets focus on getting through this first wave of COVID-19, which continues..."
Right! The first wave has to be dealt with until the election is over. 13
"Why is it that the headings are so easy to decipher,yet cause so much consternation with some. I do agree with #4 though. After the election,things will change. And thats all I'll say about that.lol"
"With respect to eating establishments, it is limited... the number of restaurants that are open is reduced in each casino and those restaurants that are open have limited their menus as well..."
"Post Covid-19 is sometime next year, possibly at the start of 2022.I would hope there is an effective vaccine that knocks it out.Otherwise, I want to get it, develop antibodies while not infecting people I care about."
Part of the problem I have is should I spend the rest of my year sitting in my house reading books and drinking beer while avoiding human contact to avoid getting infected until a vaccine is developed?
"One issue is if it will kill me, I will do whatever I can to avoid it, but if I have 3-4 days of feeling like crap and it's gone, I'll deal."
"The major reason for me cancelling my trip was when masks became mandatory while lounging at poolside, also bars closed and no shows open. Hopefully by the end of this year , they will have a vaccine."
"The biggest difference is the city of Las Vegas, the entire region is now pretty much f%$ked.Don't kid yourselves, it might be the same some day, but it will be years. The recession, 9/11, their impact was nothing compared to this. Las Vegas wasn't built for gamblers. It wasn't built for people who love it there. It was built for business and trade. Their singular lifeblood is trade shows and meetings. And those aren't happening for a long, LONG time.Sixty percent of the restaurants on The Strip will shutter. Half a dozen casinos on The Strip either won't reopen or will end up shutting down again. Trade shows, meetings, concerts, events, all gone for the forseeable future. It's goin to get much much worse before it gets better."
What’s changed..... everything
"@Post #10 - "" Hopefully by the end of this year , they will have a vaccine.""I won't be rushing to get a vaccination, in light of the fast-track conditions that are being agreed. Big pharma is getting indemnity on long-term side effects from the vaccine.https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-astrazenec…"
"Here are some items that might not be noted in every public online videos/pics (providing that you have seen some already)....Most hotels, if not all, have free self-parking. Meanwhile, most hotels are not offering valet service. Many hotels (provided that they are open) have about 20% - 30% occupancy during weekdays, and about 50% - 60% on the weekends. (Staff from different hotels/chains have mentioned this.)Frequently you will come across displays of free: hand sanitizer dispensers; disposable masks; disposable gloves; and sanitizing wipes in casinos (and at every business too).Common policy for elevator usage is now limited to 4 people maximum (if users are not already associated with each other).Many slot machines (I estimate it at about 25%) are electronically disabled for social distancing. (For example, it is common to see the following: For 3 slots arranged in a linear fashion, 1 will be disabled; For 4 slots arranged linearly, 2 will be disabled; For islands of 3 or 4 slots, none will be disabled.)Some casino bathroom sinks and urinals have physical barriers:https://i.postimg.cc/h48Q9z9x/3-F8-A20-AD-BC…https://i.postimg.cc/ZKTBjbcQ/69-BAB231-F11-…https://i.postimg.cc/sDwBNkHg/E278-F485-610-…QR scan codes are everywhere. Most restaurants have their menus posted outside their store fronts, accessible by your smartphone through QR scan codes.Edited: 8:35 am, August 02, 2020 "
Are all slot machines turned on or do they have some turned off for distancing ?
"sally lBinghamton, New Yo rkAll slots. ( to my knowledge) have social distancing policises - (e.g. Every other machine turned off, some have barrier shieilds set up etc. ) THis is same type set in in PA Casinos."

"Pre covid Las Vegas was a National and International destination. People came for gambling, dining, shows, clubs, conventions and trade shows.Las Vegas after the reopening is mainly a regional destination for people driving in from nearby states and a few folks flying in from states farther away. The people come for gambling, partying and limited dining. Just my thoughts."
Does anyone have information on Shows?Is it partially opened or is all closed?Free shows for Diamond member is one of the reason why I liked Vegas vs other casinos.
"No shows are available. Hopefully things will get back to normal by next spring, but it could be later in 2021."
"What changed, me not going to Las Vegas. I am in Canada and can't go as I am an essential service worker (who knew?). So if I flew down, I would have to self isolate for 2 weeks with no pay. I am not going to take a chance on my health. For me Vegas is a place to getaway and have fun to destress. So until we get a vaccine or the virus dies out (if that ever happens), I'll be staying home. Miss it for sure. I have my gambling $ all set. Just need the virus to go away or get a vaccine. Until then, I'll just have to read trip advisor. Good luck to all that venture out though"
"""The first wave has to be dealt with until the election is over.PnS, is that you? If you think the US will be in great shape because the election takes place you're living on another planet."
"""Does anyone have information on Shows?""Well, someone said according to a concierge some Cirque shows and others will open August 1st.Yes, I know.I think it will be many years before Las Vegas remotely resembles what it used to just six months ago.Edited: 1:33 pm, August 06, 2020 "
