"I am hoping someone here can tell me if Americans need to quarantine 14 days at home after visiting Mexico? I am just curious because we, British Columbians, need to quarantine 14 days if we leave Canada right now. Many thanks.]]"
"All of Canada needs to quarantine for 14 days after any international return. I don't think AMericans do, but I'll let them chime in to confirm."

"I believe it is a *recommendation by the CDC. But if I travel anywhere during covid, I planned on it anyway."
"besides the numerous mistakes the US government made handling this crisis, this is one thing they got right, it's not the travel that causes the spikes, but totally neglijent people."
"Currently, there is virtually no federal level coordination around COVID 19 in the USA. Other than White House efforts to attempt to force schools to reopen in the coming weeks or lose access to federal relief and some uncoordinated efforts to continue to deny the nature and extent of the virus, nearly all relevant policies are being undertaken at state or local levels. Some states have imposed quarantines, but there are so many states that I cannot sum up the general picture.Edited: 5:52 pm, July 31, 2020 "
For international travel the CDC says YES. Check their website below and it’s under Travelers Health. https://www.cdc.gov
"Each US State can also have different guidelines. I found mine for returning to Kansas and it recommends CDC guidelines, but mandates a 14 day quarantine if returning from Florida."
"they advise to do it, but it's not mandatory."
"just can't wait for our federal government to lift this outdated restriction. EU lifted it for us a few weeks ago, expecting the same from us,but our incompetent healthcare system doesn't know what to do, they just figured it out a few weeks ago that masks are the most important form of protection."
I like the restrictions that we have.
"https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news…This article gives state by state summaries. But seems aimed at within the US, only a few mentioned international travel."
"Yaz, me too! I wish that Dr Bonnie Henry would mandate that masks must be worn in all public places."
"For international travel the CDC says YES, because we DO NOT have a nationwide plan it also depends on where you live by state. I only know what’s mandated in my state (CT), the 14 day quarantine for people visiting from ‘hot spot’ states are fined $1000 per day in they don’t comply, I don’t know how they are enforcing it. For me personally, I work for a company that globally requires all employees to quarantine for 14 days after returning from nonessential (vacation) outside of the country or specific states as well, using additional personal or vacation time or without pay."
"It is a ""recommendation"" by CDC for returning to the US from foreign travel, but not a ""requirement"" or legally obligated."
Yaz and Condu. Me too.
"Yaz, I like the restrictions too, not outdated, and obviously it’s working when looking at our situation compared to the US. Ensures someone traveling from a hotspot won’t go around infecting people before they show symptoms. ,"
"From the CDC:Key Points:::Widespread ongoing transmission of a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is occurring globally.CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential international travel.Older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions are at increased risk for severe disease.There may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.US residents may have difficulty returning to the United States.Travelers should avoid contact with sick people and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.All international travelers should stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing."
"But that is an ""advisory"", a ""recommendation"". People could ignore it, it's not law.Different from Oahu, Hawaii . So I need to revise my ""no"" post for at least some places in the USA.To use that example if you arrive Honolulu International Airport in August 2020 there IS a 14-day mandatory quarantine for everyone. You are required to go to a hotel or your home and stay put. Not even grocery shopping allowed. Food delivered only. No car rental. It's very strict."
Suze we're the same as Hawaii and I like it. We seem to be doing okay so far. We're going to do our best to follow our BC medical teams advice. Stay safe all.
"Yes I know Canada is different.Cliu/OP asked about ""Americans"" in her wording compared to BC... I assumed she meant the USA?Edited: 11:22 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"The answer to your question is No, you are not required."
"I find it ironic that if you visit Chicago, IL from Wisconsin, you must quarantine 14 days. Last weekend only 72 murders in Chicago. So chances are you can quarantine and not spread the virus........but your chance of being murdered are great! Don't you just love Chicago's thought process? Be safe folks!"
"A HUGE thank you to everyone for all your responses! Great to know. Hopefully Covid numbers will improve in PV so our Canadian travel advisory can be lifted from ""avoid all non essential travel"" along with doing away with the 14 day quarantine. But, right now, I totally understand why it is necessary.Stay safe everyone!"
The answer concerning returning to the USA varies state-by-state.

"I’m in California USA and our governor has issued the “recommendation “ to self quarantine for 14 days upon return to your home county from any travel, weather it be out of the county or state. Because this is a “recommendation “ only, many are not doing the 14-day quarantine. Our county’s case count is low however, many of our cases have been traced back to persons traveling. I’m not a proponent of casting ALL Americans in the light that many on the forum are, but I can certainly see why it’s happening. Not all 331,000,000+ of us should be lumped into one category. Millions of us are staying home."
"#26....I think some believe that the 14 day quarantine only pertains to distance traveling. What if you live in a zip code that has minimal covid cases but shopped at Costco located in"" hot spot"" a few miles away? What if your job is also located in a ""hot spot ""? Do you quarantine yourself after each outing?"
"Everything is closed, beaches and bars alcohol is sold during daylight hours from 7-3pm at Sam’s club in Nuevo."
"CDC recommendations mean nothing in the U S & the various states recommendations aren't much better. For a state or municipality to ""recommend"" anything holds about as much water as a sieve and few will comply. Wash your hands & avoid the crowds. Safe travels Life is good"
"Once again I'll repeat. It depends the state in the USA you are returning to. Hawaii is more than a ""recommendation"" it's a mandatory 14-day quarantine at this time and is being enforced (you can read discussions and updates from DEs on the Oahu forum)."
"Each state has different guidelines as to a 14 day quarantine upon return. Below is the list for Kansans. It lists a few countries but also says *any Level 3 risk country as determined by the CDC, and Mexico is Level 3. Kansas updates their quarantine list every 2 weeks. - Florida on or after June 29.- Arizona between June 17 – July 27.- Been on a cruise ship or river cruise on or after March 15.- International travel to Bahrain or French Guiana July 14 – July 26.- International travel on or after July 14 to countries with a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Notice, including China, Iran, European Schengen area, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Brazil. International travelers must follow CDC guidance and protocols."
Rene....I was out last night. I can assure you not everything is closed. A ton of places are open.
"It was just announced that Hawaii will accept Canadian tourists as of September 1, with no quarantine, as long as they show evidence of a negative covid test within 72 hours of travel.This to me sounds like a smart way to reopen to tourism.Edited: 1:09 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Alberta...that's the best news today...i was just writing in another forum how hawaii should take some pointers from Mexico how to open tourism...still think they need to limit occupancy levels, but probably it's not going to be an onslaught of tourists anyway... https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hawaii-welcomes-canada-back-september-1.5672470#:~:text=via%20Associated%20Press)-,A%20winter%20travel%20escape%20may%20not%20be%20top%2Dof%2Dmind,starting%20Sept.%201%2C%202020.&text=The%20test%20must%20be%20taken,boarding%20a%20flight%20to%20Hawaii.Edited: 1:14 pm, August 03, 2020 "

"""Hawaii will accept Canadian tourists as of September 1, with no quarantine, as long as they show evidence of a negative covid test within 72 hours of travel.""I'm just curious, will Canada test because someone wants to travel? Or maybe you have to pay for it?To be tested here, you have to have symptoms."
"I can’t speak for the other provinces, but here in Alberta, anyone who wants a test can get one. Free."
That is great Alberta! I wish we could do that here.
"Hawaii will accept all tourists (not just Canadians) sept 1st with a negative covid test dated 3 days prior to arrival. In theory this sounds great BUT it is nearly impossible to get a test back within 3 days. Yes, they have the rapid tests used by hospitals for surgeries but those are not being offered for ""tourism covid testing."" In my state (WA) you can get this test that Hawaii is requiring but it will cost $125 pp and is not covered by insurance. We have a trip to maui scheduled( much before corona) that we are supposed to go on November 14th, so I have researched and called all around to find this novel coronavirus test that Hawaii will be requiring (starting sept 1st). Also, if you are traveling inter island there is no 14 day quarantine or testing needed.Edited: 2:00 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Kansas, You can't get a free covid test in your state? Here in WA we can get free testing at several drive through testing facilities. Our county administers 1000's of test a day, all free."
"The tests are free but you have to have symptoms. They quiz you thoroughly. For a long time there just weren't enough tests and I'm sure they aren't overflowing with them now, but they have more of them now."
"Again speaking for Alberta, my daughter got her results in one day."
"kansas, That is interesting. Back in the spring you had to have symptoms but for several months now ANYONE can get a covid test symptoms or not."
"because of the nature of my work i already got tested 4 times in the last 2 months...it's not that easy to get the virus, you really have to be unlucky if you respect all the rules."
"I can bet that Canada will not be giving out ""free"" travel covid tests for people that want it for trips to Hawaii."
"Again in Alberta, anyone who wants a test, gets one. No question."
"Absolutely, same thing here in Washington. However, if I was a betting person, I am guessing that if you want a covid test for traveling to Hawaii (as the Hawaii governor is requesting) you are going to need to pay for it as it is deemed non essential. My family from Edmonton is supposed to meet us in Maui in November and as of now their primary doctor will not administer the test without symptoms. I am guessing there will be a way to get the test/results but you will need to pay for it, Maybe I am wrong."
Our health care here is very different. No charge for tests. They are not done by your doctor. They need to make an appointment online and go to one of the many test sites.
"Yes we have testing centers and you can make online appointments, but they will quiz you. My husband's doctor arranged our tests though. But it's virtually the same in that regard.Edited: 2:43 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Yes, I know that your healthcare is very different, I am married to a Canadian. When we found about about the covid testing that Hawaii will require we instantly told my in-laws as they would be traveling from Edmonton. We asked them to check into the covid testing on their end and report back. Your covid testing clinics cannot guarantee test results back within 72 hours as Hawaii is requesting for now. They are now looking into ""tourism covid testing"" which will require them to pay for since they are different testing (leisure) that would ensure their test results back therefor incurring a charge. I too could go everyday of the week here in WA state and get a free covid test, however, the result come back within 5 days. To ensure the 72 hour policy Hawaii is enforcing, I need to pay. That is all I am saying."
"It seems to be different all over our town, and apparently by state as to what is offered islandgirl. Our family all went to different places. Most of my family's tests were back in 24 hours, a couple were 48 hours, and our tests were administered within 24 hours of the appointment being made.  2 people got results within 15 minutes. But one of them waited in line for 6 hours. So here, it varies depending on where you go for the test or whether you have an appointment already."
"{Hawaii will accept all tourists ... sept 1st with a negative covid test dated 3 days prior to arrival.}Regarding Hawaii, that was originally to begin on August 1st (no quarantine with negative test within 72 hours of arrival) but it was pushed back one month at the last minute. It's possible that could happen again.Edited: 4:26 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"I am surprised you are saying that you can get the test anytime in Washington State. Watching Dr. Gupta on MSNBC, he is saying he still cannot get one, and he treats patients at UW. My neice is an ER nurse, and she cannot get one. I am assuming they mean unless they are sick. A good friend that works in nursing homes has gotten several, but has taken over a week to get results. I have not tried recently, so I do not know for sure, just repeating what I have seen and heard."
"Yes, originally supposed to be august 1st, pushed back. Will not be surprised if it pushes back again. Hawai’i is in dire straights with a tanking economy. Especially now that the CARES act has ended. I feel sorry for the locals living on $400/week unemployment."
"I live in Eastern Wa (Benton county specifically) we are still in modified phase 1.5. And considered a “hot spot”. We have several drive through sites that are open 7 days a week for Covid testing. I am shocked to hear that people in Seattle can’t get tested (if that’s true). Hell, even Riteaid is offering free Covid testing.Edited: 5:14 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"My daughter got tested last week very easily in So Cal. Next day drive through test, next day result (negative). No reason needed for the test. Covered fully by insurance. She needed it as a condition of being allowed to move into her college dorm.Edited: 5:17 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"From the City of Seattle website...""If you live, work, or regularly visit Seattle, and you are experiencing a symptom(s) of COVID-19 ​and/or​ you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19​ within the past 14 days, you can be tested for free."""
Depends on the state you live in or are even going to in the states.
We returned from PV on July 17th so just completed our quarantines July 31st and the government called to verify we had obeyed all the requirements. We are Covid-free. All the stores require distancing and some limit access. Masks are voluntary. Some residents refuse to ride the elevator with others. Prices are up across the board from early November.
"Today, all travelers need to quarantine after visiting from anywhere. Unless you don't think you should have to, or refuse to, because of an unquestionable belief and adherence to, a distorted, mythical and God granted exceptionalism.Edited: 8:40 am, August 19, 2020 "
"@ #60 - I believe the word ""need"" refers to a law based answer - no need to be snarky"
"Our family would like us to isolate for 14 days after our return. Not possible, since we're returning 10 days prior to Thanksgiving. We'll wear both masks and face shields on the plane and sanitize carefully. When in Vallarta, we'll practice the same safety measures that Kevin does. I appreciate his input. When we return, we will have Covid-19 tests prior to gathering with family. As stated, they're easy to get in SoCal. I made an appointment, called when I arrived, the doctor came to my car and swabbed my nose. I received my negative results the next day."
