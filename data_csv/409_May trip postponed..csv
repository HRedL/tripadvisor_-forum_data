"BF and I had a trip planned for May 30-6/4 to celebrate my 50th bday. Booked flights with Hawaiian Air and stay at the Princess Kauilani. Received a letter mid March from the PK manager stating our reservation was moved to Sheraton Waikiki at the same rate. After finding out that Hawai’i Stay at Home Order was extended til 5/31 we decided to move our trip. Called Sheraton Waikiki and although they could no longer offer us the same rate as the PK since they would be up and running by our new dates of August 20th, they did offer us a great rate with room upgrade to Ocean View. Called Hawaiian Air to switch flights and with no wait time and no hassle our flights were now switched to August. Now just hoping that everything is up and running by the time our vacation arrives and #’s decrease until then. Wishing everyone stay safe and healthy."
Glad you got it all rearranged. Perhaps by August Hawaii will be on the mend a little bit. Had to postpone my May trip to the mainland also!!
Hopefully!
Keeping an eye on how things work out - hope to rebook for October otherwise its 2021 for us
We were supposed to fly to Oahu in three days. Obviously we had to cancel those plans. We have rescheduled our trip for September. My hope is that the situation will allow us to take the trip. I also hope that the situation will be very clear by then. I don’t want to endanger anyone in Hawaii or myself.We would be happy to follow social distancing requests. A 14 day quarantine though seems like a clear request for us to stay home. It is going to be “interesting “ to see how this plays out. I will content myself with looking at our pictures for now and pray for this poor battered world!
We too are planning to rebook our April trip to October. If that doesn't work ... it'll be 2021 for us.
Our trip is scheduled for mid June. Traveling from mainland. Second time that I have postponed it. I only hope that for mid June things are better.
"Let’s hope all is cleared soon, not just for us who are anxiously awaiting our visit to paradise but so that more lives are not lost, businesses do not continue to loose money, children can return to live a “normal” life and we can get some sense of peace of mind."
I think it's necessary to keep an eye on things for timing. Here in Seattle some things are soon to reopen (you can go to the dentist :) But some major summer events are already being cancelled (or live stream only) out into June and July.
"We are all still self isolating and nothing has opened here in BC. I was able to ""postpone"" our Nov/Dec 2020 trip until Nov/Dec 2021. Hopefully, there will be a vaccine before then. My heart goes out to all those that have lost so much during this pandemic. I feel truly blessed that the pandemic has not hit Vancouver Island as hard as it did in other areas."
We were due to fly out on Tuesday but all cancelled. We are planning to return next May instead. We haven't lost any money. In fact we gained on the dollar conversion with refunds. Hope this terrible virus will be contained by then. Stay safe all.
Was looking forward to my annual trip to Hawaii in November 2020 which is now postponed indefinitely.I hope the World gets back to normal one day.
Agro_Sydney; Curious as to why you already pulled the plug on your November trip?I have 3 weeks planned on the islands that time as well and watching the situation unfold. I just have not come to your conclusion as of yet and wonder what yours was.
"I pulled the plug on my November trip because I can't see the Covid-19 virus being under control for international travel from Australia by November.  I hope I am wrong.We may need to have ""Health Passports"" as well as travel passports.Craig h when do you think the Covid-19 virus will be under control in the USA?I might be able to book at the last minute for November if a miracle happens.Edited: 11:35 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"Hi Agro-Sydney. I rebooked for next May as the virus has hit us pretty hard here in the UK - so many deaths sadly. I'm hoping that if international travel gets up and running, then by May they should have all the social distancing on flights well tried out by then and hopefully it wont affect our holiday too much. Fingers crossed for a vaccine by then."
"Hi Crazycross, I was about to book when the Corona virus hit hard. We are lucky in Australia as we have only had 95 deaths which is 95 too many and which could have been prevented. I hope everything will be back to the new ""normal"" by May 2021.It will be good if Hawaii can isolate like other ""islands"" like Australia and New Zealand and control or kill the virus.Edited: 8:38 am, May 05, 2020 "
