"Can someone give me a site that lists all scheduled events for spring/summer 2020. I'm trying to narrow down a few days in mid week to visit and am trying to avoid festivals/huge sporting events/awards shows etc. We would be staying within a few miles of downtown and are familiar with the area. I don't need help finding accommodations, just help with dates. Thanks in advance."
"https://www.nowplayingnashville.com/ is one of the most comprehensive events calendars, but this far out I'm sure a lot of things aren't settled yet so won't be on the calendar."
"The biggest dates that you should be planning around to avoid an influx of visitors due to planned events - off the top of my head, but by no means a comprehensive list - would be the SEC Tournament (March 11-15 are dates I'm seeing right now), The Nashville Marathon (Weekend of April 25), CMA Fest (June 4-7 with a couple days before and after), and the days surrounding the 4th of July holiday."
"That would be the major events that are already set.You should also check the calendar for Music City Center to see what is on tap for there. Some events, like the Southern Women's Show will draw mostly locals, so it will increase traffic a bit, it won't have a major impact on other activities. (https:/â€¦calendarThe major venues that you can check calendars for are: Nissan StadiumBridgestone ArenaMunicipal AuditoriumFirst Tennessee Park (soon to become First Horizon Park)Ascend AmphitheaterSchermerhorn Symphony CenterRyman AuditoriumTPAC (Tennessee Performing Arts Center)War Memorial AuditoriumThese are the major venues in the Downtown area that can accommodate at least 1,000 patrons. I think I've listed them in order of largest to smallest, give or take a few hundred."
Thank you all very much
"Well due to COVID-19 you in luck. No festivals, No gatherings so come on down"
