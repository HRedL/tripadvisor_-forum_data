"Hi everyone, so i asked already in another thread about passport extensions, but today my question is about obtaining a new passport from Venezuela for a child, my wifes daughter to be exact who is nearly 10 years old. We want to get a new passport for her and ideally, we would like to pay for it with a credit card from Ireland, however Saime have said that is not possible. I am just wondering how can we obtain a passport for a child in Venezuela while we are here? Do new applicants need to pay with Petro or a venezuelan credit card etc? We want to try get her daugther a passport so we can apply for a visa for her. thanks in advance for the help"
"Discussing your situation with my Venezuelan friend here in my apartment in Medellin Colombia, we are under quarantine, and impossible to do outside of Colombia then with a credit card from Ireland.She had to pay cash while she was in her home of Maracaibo in December 2019 for her new passport, $500. US dollars in CASH paid to a black market individual who has connections, no other way to get it done.After the fee was paid it took almost 2 months for the passport to be completed and delivered.Unless someone else has better information for you.Good luck, stay safe and god speed.Edited: 6:15 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"Pay with Bolivares, or USD dollars. Accepted everywhere in Venezuela."
"Thanks for the reply to you both. Would Saime accept that though? I know there is dollar in the country, but is it officially accepted by Maduro's government? And do payments need to be made online through the Saime portal? Its very hard when you are outside of the country and no real consulate close. The consulate in London rarely replies"
I believe all appointments and deliveries have been postponed until after the Covid-19 lockdown is over.
"Just published:bancaynegocios.com/saime-activa-portal-web-p…El director del Servicio Administrativo de Identificación Migración y Extranjería (Saime), Gustavo Vizcaíno, informó que se mantiene activo el portal web del ente para procesar trámites de pasaportes y prórrogas, durante la cuarentena social por el Covid-19.Explicó que los usuarios pueden ingresar en la dirección www.saime.gob.ve para introducir las solicitudes y las redes sociales permanecen activas las 24 horas para responder a otras inquietudes de relevancia.Por otra parte, indicó que el Saime no está enviando documentos a sedes consulares y sedes regionales, debido a la suspensión de vuelos comerciales, colo medida para combatir la pandemia."
"Thanks for the update, so basically they wont do anything until the lockdown is over? are they still printing passport extensions in Saime or are they also closed? Just it wasnt sure with the article."
