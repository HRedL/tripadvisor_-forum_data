The airline got the bail out and now AA is bailing out on the flyers.https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Amerâ€¦
"The middle seat blocking thing was just PR spin from the beginning. If you think that flying is a risk worth taking then having a seat blocked off next to you is going to make almost zero difference to your chances of getting infected.Just as long as the crew have the correct PPE, everyone who want to fly should do it."
"""As of June 30, American also will ask customers to certify that they have been free of covid-19 symptoms for the previous 14 days."" - Another piece of pointless PR, what about all those who have covid-19 but have no symptoms"
Tom what about all those that have it and decide to be less than truthful with their answer

"Given the fatality rate they may well have other things on their minds than flying. It smacks of 'needs must' and if they don't fill them the trench deepens beyond repair. I seem to recall that in 2018 AA announced, with their annual accounts, an about turn of aircraft orders. They 'converted' a substantial number of Max's into 787's and deferred a collosal number of orders through to '21/22 ish due to funding. I don't think they were in the best shape before this crisis hit, right now they may not have much of a choice.And to answer your question . . . as soon as 'normal' returns so will the punters, it'll all be erased by the $6 fare difference."
"Other airlines have been indicating they have been eliminating many middle seats from advance seat reservations but I don't recall them every guaranteeing that the middle seat will remain vacant. If they have passengers who want to fly, do you honestly think they'll leave them at the gate so they can keep all middle seats free? Airlines are hemorrhaging money and they're not about to pass up the fare they can get by putting someone in a middle seat. UA, for example, says they will notify you if you flight is going to be close to capacity and allow you to switch to another less crowded flight, but that may not work if you're making a connection or other things contingent on your flight times.Passenger travel will increase and as it does, you'll see fewer vacant seats. Plan on coming with your own PPE, even thought the airlines say they will provide masks and hand sanitizer."
