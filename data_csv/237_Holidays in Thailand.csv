Is it possible that Thailand Will be open to tourists in November?
Its possible
Maybe/maybe not.
"I think so. Being the best country in handling Covid, I won't be surprised if they will be open by November. I have booked our tickets from Pattaya to Koh Kood via Phuketferry and all is good. My ticket is open for any rescheduling for free though. The country of origin though may be a factor."
"Kieron M1 post Sure, anything is possible. It is even possible that you could win El Gordo too!-* There may be some special requirements in place if you can visit. Read up on what hoops you will have to jump through just to enter Thailand. Good luck.Edited: 9:52 am, August 04, 2020 "
"It may also depend on the situation of Covid-19 in your unnamed country.You are welcome!Edited: 2:04 pm, August 04, 2020 "
Much may depend on the country you are coming from Kieron M. I would not be booking any flights just yet though. Still a great deal of uncertainty and overall the World daily death tolls with Covid seem to be rising.
"Your are just going to have to wait and see and watch out for the Press Release from the Government.Post #3, The Countries that have handle Covid 19 very well have lot to protect. Take New Zealand as an example. So these will be the last to open up. Countries where it is out of control, like the USA have little to lose by being open.One issue is the import and then export of it.Chok Dee"
We come to Thailand every Christmas and I feel it's not looking likely for this year. I have to buy 5 flights from the UK so at the price they are at Xmas I feel it just isn't worth the risk. I really do hope Thailand change their quarantine rules but I feel they will change the rules back as quick
"Yes, Thailand might open their borders by November, and then again perhaps they won’t. Personally I feel the latter is most likely, yet if it is possible to enter Thailand, the insurance and quarantine requirements will possibly make it too expensive and difficult to be worthwhile. You would need to check that very carefully and thoroughly to avoid any unpleasant surprises on entry. Obviously potential travellers also need to be aware of whatever their own country requires on re-entry. Self funded quarantine in a hotel for 14 days would make the whole idea of the holiday out of the question and certainly not much fun."
I think most probably Thailand will open to internation tourists in November which is the start of peak season. However they may not allow those countries which are famous for anti face mask and score low in Covid 19 battle.
Good luck with that ....
"We booked our flights last november , to Phuket 7th November this year.We had booked our hotel in Khao lak paid a deposit but as they asked for full payment on the 8th sept we rang them and asked if we could defer the full payment till at least the first of nov. They said it would be best to cancel now and they would refund our deposit. Does this tell us we won’t be going.. This was through booking.com. Our flights are still active with flights4you. I have rang them a few times seems no change as yet but do I think we will go ,,,NO. We just have to wait ."
"Linda, if, as at present, Thailand is not accepting international tourists in the run up to 7 November then your outbound flight from the UK will be cancelled. This would likely occur around a month prior to your travel date.I am becoming increasingly pessimistic about ‘normal’ tourists being allowed in before the end of 2020."
Maybe not:https:/…
"The only accurate answer ... NOBODY KNOWS. Until the government makes an official announcement, no one can answer any questions as to when tourism to Thailand will resume. But I love how numerous folks have dragged out the TTG article as their evidence. Lets see ...Thaiglish job title - TAT Deputy Governor of International MarketingWestern equivalent - assistant to the head of international marketingThais love flamboyant titles for menial positions filled by children of the elite families - Na Ayudhya (the journalist couldn't even get the family name right throughout most of the article)."
"I'll say it, unofficially, and don't need a title. You can scratch Thailand as a holiday destination in 2020, for most normal tourism.That really is a no-brainer, and you'd be an idiot to waste your time booking anything.NZ has the best chance, if they do the bundle/cluster thingy, but doubtful this year. That tour group Idea is also highly unlikely, and would just be for China, Korea, Japan any way, as the ones that enjoy that type of traveling, but really can't see that happen either. And silly expensive if it did.So wouldn't benefit most of TA's Thailand members. Since things are so slow for starting up now, for local & expat tourism, that is possible, now, more place still closed than open, and many will never reopen, unless you own the building, don't expect much of a holiday if in the unlikely event, any part left of high season is ever opened.Unless wanting a very low key, R&R holiday, which we've been out & about a few times, enjoying the no crowds. Out again this week, for a few weeks. Just loving it. oops .... Sorry.I'd make my plans for high season 2021, and still only book refundable everything. If lucky, rainy season might be available, but doubt it. Think it depends on MSM's 2nd & 3rd wave hysteria, which I don't follow, so good luck with that."

"Some form of entry might be possible...... but it is likely to be accompanied by a lot of paperwork and travel restrictions within the country.The tourist industry in Thailand has basically shut down and many companies have totally collapsed. So quite apart from the military-dominated government deciding to ease restrictions, there is the added problem that if and when they do, much of the infrastructure will have collapsed.Hotels, travel companies etc have gone to the wall. Transport services ... bust ...... small street food vendors have no money to restart....taxis cant pay for their vehicles....many cant even eat...Thailand is being rather ambivalent about foreigners in general. ..they are considered to be the source of Covid and therefore Thailand's problems. ... BUT they desperately need foreigners to restart the business The government has tried to promote ""home tourism"" ... but even at full capacity it only approaches 30% of the tourist trade . Now with no money and being the rainy season, they are flogging a dead horse.So what about November,My feeling is that even if more foreigners are allowed in, it would be a pretty miserable place to holiday.If the government introduced a massive campaign of reductions and freebies, then things might take off this year.....otherwise I'd wait and see."
"""Being the best country in handling Covid,""This is precisely the reason that Thailand may not be open for some time.From the start Thailand was lucky rather than scientific about Covid...but a military regime allowed the government to implement draconian measures re outside travel. Furlledmore hyxenophobia than science. Furthermore the measures have brought immeasurable hardship to many involved in tourism and an 80% reduction in business over the year.. it will take a lot more than governmental ""all clear"" to reopen the country.And then we have to believe the figures too."
""" much of the infrastructure will have collapsed."" .... seriously. Yet another totally ridiculous statement from you. Geez, and I thought I was Mr Negative. Thailand, with exception of those dependent, and who geared their business totally around foreign tourist (not the brightest idea), yes, they are getting crushed. Unless owning their premises, probably closed and done for good.Sure their greedy hands made a bundle when times were good, hope, or not, they saved a bit for rough times.The rest of Thailand, is rebounding quite well. Big metros are busy busy again, and the smaller villages, well, they weren't really affected at all.But you wouldn't know that, since not here, are you ? Why would you be, as you really hate the place."
"I am reasonably sure that the infrastructure won't have collapsed.From what I can new highways/freeways being constructed, new rail lines, new​ shopping malls etc. New​ metro rail lines in Bangkok. New​ metro lines in cities in Esan. Given the level of unemployment and the once in human history low interest rates, any sensible government would be building infrastructure. On a very minor level Khao San Road has received a makeover to make it 'tourist friendly' and pretty like Disneyland.As for opening up to say New Zealand. New Zealand has just recorded 4 new Covid19 cases. Back into lock down. Businesses shut, people required to stay in their homes. Snakes and Ladders. Thailand won't open up until mid to late 2021.Thailand is not collapsing. The sky has not fallen in. Things are very difficult for people in Phuket, Hua Hin, Pattaya, Koh Samui etc, but those areas are isolated foreign tourist ghettos. If Japanese and other manufacturers suddenly left Thailand there would be a far bigger hit to Thai economy."
"Somluk - you are so very wrong - it already has. You just don't know what I mean by infrastructure in tourism - not civil engineering.The fact is that major hotel chains and travel companies ae going to the wall. Everyone from management to cleaners have left the business and some may never return......rehiring will be a mess.Food deliveries suppliers have go under, services -from cleaning to IT are all reduced.Many businesses simply haven't got the capital to continue and buildings will be left empty in ;limbo.furthermore if anyone expects the numbers to be anywhere near 40 million after the borders are gingerly speed, is living in cloud cuckoo land.As for when we get back to visitors - the latest comment from TAT is that is won't be till 2021.BTW - as for the latest on the big EE 'infrastructure"" schemes you will see that sponsors ae pulling out and certain parts e.g. hi-speed to Pattaya have been shelved."
