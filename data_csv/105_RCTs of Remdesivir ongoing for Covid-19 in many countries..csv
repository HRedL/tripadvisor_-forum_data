"There are currently many drug candidates and many compationate uses of those drugs for Covid-19. Although Favipiravir(Avigan) was approved in China, it's not yet approved and an international randomized clinical trial (RCT) has just been started, and it is said that it will be approved in August or later in Japan and other countries. Therefore, Remdesivir of Gilead Sciences, whose 6 RCTs are currently ongoing in China, the U.S.A., and other countries, as follows, seems to be the most promising drug for the earliest approval in the world.https:/…remdesivir-clinical-trialsAmong those 6 trials, we will soon see the results of the 2 RCTs in China in April. It is the anti-viral medicine, so it may not be effective to patients with severe pneumonia, who already have cytokine storm, but may be effective to patients with mild or moderate degree pneumonia."
"The results of ""Compassionate Use of Remdesivir for 53 Patients with Severe Covid-19"" was reported in NEJM on April 10, as follows. https:/…Although 57%(30 cases) of these patients were receiving mechanical ventilation and 8%(4 cases) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO), 68% (36 cases) had an improvement in oxygen-support class. Therefore, remdesivir might not only be effective for mild and moderate degree pneuminia by Covid-19, it might also be effective for severe degree pneumonia by the virus. The results of ongoing RCTs of the drug for Covit-19 are eagerly awaited."
From today's news feed:Gilead Sciences said that a draft document showing disappointing results from a closely watched clinical trial of the company’s treatment for the coronavirus contained “inappropriate characterizations” and that the study’s findings were “inconclusive.”andFinancial Times reported that antiviral drug remdesivir did not improve Covid-19 patients’ conditions or reduce the virus’ presence in the bloodstream in a clinical trial in China.
"Thank you, Japan CustomTours Japan. Yes, Financial Times unfortunately reported yesterday that Gilead's coronavirus drug, Remdesivir, flops in first trial. However, in addition to the fact that the study includes ""inappropriate characterization"", the first trial among the 2 clinical trials in China was only for SEVERE patients with Covid-19, as follows.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…Severe patients are known to have Cytokine Storm, which can be too late to be treated only by anti-viral drugs. But, most patients are mild to moderate degree when this disease is diagnosed. Thus, this medicine can be effective when given at its early stage and we have to wait until we see the results of its RCTs for mild and moderate degree patients in the near future."
"Don't believe everything you read online. As a physician and scientist, I personally don't trust anything comes from China. The said results of the Chinese study are now removed from the WHO website:""Results from a study investigating Gilead Sciences' antiviral medication remdesivir as a Covid-19 treatment were posted to the World Health Organization's website ""prematurely"" on Thursday and showed ""inconclusive"" results, according to the biotechnology company.The information is no longer on WHO's website.""Today, information from the first clinical study evaluating the investigational antiviral remdesivir in patients with severe Covid-19 disease in China was prematurely posted on the World Health Organization website. This information has since been removed, as the study investigators did not provide permission for the publication of the results. Furthermore, we believe the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study,"" said Dr. Merdad Parsey, chief medical officer of Gilead Sciences in a statement on Twitter.""https:/…index.htmlSome hospitals here in Southern California including where I work have been using remdesivir for a few weeks and the results as far as I can see are optimal. We're not conducting a formal study so I can't show data, but we'll keep using remdesivir for most COVID patients. Stay healthy and well, everyone!"
"Yep, the publishing and removal of some preliminary results adds to the curious elements around this. There are of course other reports around in the media and some pre-published results floating around, but I certainly don't believe everything I see in the media. If I did that, I could watch either of the polar opposite cable news channels feeding ""information"" to the USA. Still, it is interesting to see the contrast between stations like CNN vs Fox.Hope your treatments and patients do well over there in southern Cal Dr S."

"Yes, as our Prime Minister Mr. Abe mentioned yesterday, Remdesivir of Gilead Sciences will probably be approved in early May in the U.S.A. and also in other countries including Japan. Avigan (Favipiravir) will probably be approved later in Japan and other countries, although I and Dr. Yoshitake Yokokura, President of Japan Medical Association, wished it to be approved earlier."
Some celebrities are cured by it and talking in a few days their terrible fever went down. The TV news program are mentioning the patients can ask to the doctors to prescribe Avigan and if the Hospital Committee approves they will be offered even it is risky for people expecting to have babies.Is it right to understand that Avigan is more effective during the initial stage and Remdesivir works for patients with serious conditions?
Gilead says early results of coronavirus drug trial show improvement with shorter remdesivir treatment = https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/gilead-repor…
"Don't get too carried away thinking this is cure or ""game changer"". Note the benefits are minor (slightly shorter recovery time) and included a quote in the reports (from Fauci) that the mortality benefit ""has not reached statistical significance""."
"Actually, I'd think shortening recovery time to potentially free up ICU space is pretty good progress? I'm no expert but if you can have a person spend less time in an ICU bed, that means someone can fill it sooner and thus reduces the burden on the system, which is as I understand, THE biggest concern with this virus as failure to have adequate resources will increase death rates due to lack of treatment."
"The most important point in the announcement regarding the RCT of Remdesivir by Gilead Sciences on April 29 was that it was effective for SEVERE patients with pneumonia by Covid-19, which is completely different from the results in earlier inappropriate RCT in China on April 23. SEVERE pneumonia with Cytokine Storm is much more difficult to be treated only by anti-viral medicine than mild or moderate degree of pneumonia without Cytokine Storm. The RCT of Remdesivir conducted by Gilead Sciences for mild and moderate Covid-19 infection is going to be reported soon, but it will definitely show better results than this one. I can say now that Remdesivir is definitely going to be approved in the U.S.A., Japan, and other countries in the near future and the stock of Gilead Sciences will further increase."
"Actually, any anti-viral medicine should be given as early as possible. There are currently more mild and moderate patients than severe patients, but if we obtain an effective anti-viral medicine, we should diagnose the disease and treat it ASAP."
"Well, but the side effect of Avigan is something that one needs to be careful, especially who would like to have a baby or babies.https:/…0323_handouts.pdfHow can you tell the difference with a cold and COVID 19 during the first few days?Edited: 4:15 am, April 30, 2020 "
"The RCT of Remdesivir for mild and moderate Covid-19 was started on March 15, 9 days later that the RCT for severe Covid-19, so the results of the former study will be reported on @a week later, and Remdesivir will probably be approved in late May. Then, for travelers, it's important to find a travel insurance which covers Remdesivir for Covid-19. Avian will be approved later, but once approved, Avigan will be cheaper and more convenient for mild Covid-19 patients than Remdesivir, since Avigan is an oral medicine, while Remdesivir is an intravenously infused medicine."
"Because COVID 19 is a special infectious disease, all the treatment concerning it would be covered by Japanese taxes, I believe.If it is normal pneumonia, you need to pay the bill."
">>>Yes, JCT, and it was frequently mentioned that it seems to work best on those with more severe symptoms and its efficacy is very dependent on when the drug is given in the course of the virus.<<Remdesivir showed clear evidence of efficacy in a good-sized placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical trial in the US. So that means physicians can now give it to patients as soon as possible where Remdesivir is available. We've been using Remdesivir at where I work for about a month now on every COVID-19 patients. It's not a silver bullet, but we see good results. It makes me feel good to have this drug at hand! I hope everybody is staying safe and well. I've been working 14-16 hours/day, but I'm still healthy. Take care!"
Having something in the tool-kit is better than nothing. Time will tell how effective this and other treatments are. Nice to hear you are keeping healthy Dr S.
Thank you JCT!A samurai doesn't go down easily :-)
Agreed. Stay safe and well and keep up the fight. I'm surprised it's not 24 or 48 on off. My sis is a pediatric oncology nurse. They still have to work since covid may kill. Some cancers will 100 percent guaranteed will kill you. My friend 49 asthma positive and came out ok after being in ICU here in Yyz. apparently had some of the highest antibody responses of most patients. Looks like they picked up in UK but gladly shook off. They have been donating plasma etc and doing all sorts of trials since discharge.
Probably worthless.https://www.zerohedge.com/health/remdesivir-…
