We have plan to travel to Siem Reap in 2 wksWondering what is the virus situation there and in Asia in general for those who are there now
Why start another thread on this topic when others already exist?Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad@ Phnom Penh
"Just look around the internet plus the other news suppliers my man for infoIts early days as yet with this new virus to be honest, it appears that there is conflicting info out there as wellMaybe some are telling porkies about the actual virus for there own means by making false claims only time will tellThe punch line is that it will be down to you to make any decision as to what is best for youThere is a thread in the Malaysia forum which is warming up nicely, I recommend you have a butchers at that for a general overview of this new virus, if its still open HA HA HAHappy Travels"
"Current status. Confirmed case from Cambodia is in Sihanoukville which has a high Chinese population. #Coronavirus #Update January 27th - 2,877 confirmed cases - 57 healed - 81 deadChina 2,816Thailand: 8Hong Kong: 8Macau: 6US: 5Australia: 5Taiwan: 5Japan: 4Malaysia: 4Singapore: 4France: 3South Korea: 4Vietnam: 2Canada: 1Cambodia: 1Nepal: 1"
"I'm NOT writing this to start any sort of panic--am just reporting regarding our three weeks just spent in Thailand and Cambodia.I caught what I thought was a cold--by timing it could have come from Thailand or Cambodia. Craziest ""cold"" of my life. Some fever, terrible coughing, nights of drenching night sweats and insane chills. It's mainly over now but the traveling companion I shared a room with has it now but didn't stay in bed for a couple day like I did and it seems to be hanging on. The other two who were in another room are showing the first symptoms. Nothing serious enough to consider going to a doctor but we're essentially self-quarantining ourselves in our friends and traveling companions home in Istanbul before we head back to the USA in about 10 days."
@SwampeastMike: and you're sharing this because?
"Sharing because three of the four traveling together all say this is unlike any cold, flu, etc. we've ever had in our lives after visiting an area with LOTS of Chinese tourists."
"No, you can't go to the USA it's there!!!SwampeastMike, yup and you've probably given whatever you have to everyone on your flight.FFS, give it another few days and there will be many more countries with confirmed cases and many more will have undiagnosed cases."
"News Flash, 3 potential cases in Istanbul.Better cancel my trip to Istanbul then."
It wouldn't stop me from returning to Cambodia tomorrow.I wish we would have spent more than four nights there.Contagious diseases spread with amazing speed and there's very little that can be done to stop it.
"Going to see a ""DOCTOR"" might well help and undergoing tests to at least determine its not the coronavirus might have been a good start JESUS WEPT"
"Only one case in Cambodia as of today. Scattered cases in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, etc. Practice overall good germ safety, get relevant vaccinations and bring mosquito repellent. Aside from Corona, there is always hazards like Zika, Malaria, Dengue amongst others. I don't suggest exposing small children or elders. Otherwise, should be ok."
@SwampeastMike: I was wondering if you were intimating that you and your mates had/have the coronavirus. If that's the case then might be 1) quite irresponsible traveling and exposing others since there is so little known about it and 2) you definitely should be seeing a doctor if you really suspect you had/have it if only for the epidemiology to help gather data.Imho of course
SwampeastMike #Typhoid MaryJust saying.........
"I expect the number of cases will skyrocket after everyone travels back from their homeland to their working/current provinces in China. The Chinese government extended the New Year holiday nationwide hoping people will stay put but many will travel regardless and expose more others to the virus.I also expect an immediate increase in other Asian countries as many people with Chinese heritage, like here in Cambodia, return from their homelands after celebrating the holiday.I pray I am wrong but only time will tell.Hopefully more people will seek medical advice if they feel sick and not do as SwampeastMike and knowingly travel while they have ""a cold"". Great way to spread a new virus. Responsible travel at its best..."
"Today's Cambodian media states one (1) confirmed case at Sihanoukville and now in medical quarantine ex flight from China.Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad@ Phnom PenhEdited: 11:24 pm, January 27, 2020 "
"Well that's the end of the tourist high season, that was quick.A friend who works for the largest Chinese inbound tour operator in SR has just lost his job as they have suspended operations until after the virus has been contained.Say what you will about Chinese Tourists, there will be many Cambodian people hurting."
Here is the media report I mentioned in posting # 15https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/wu…Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad@ Phnom Penh but next for Sydney tonight.
"It wont only be Cambodians that will suffer there are several countries who have announced Visa / Travel restrictions on Chinese Tourists / TravelersLook on the bright at least it will stop admin having to close and remove so many "" Too many Chinese Visitors in { enter name as appropriate} Posts / ThreadsKeep your head down for a while Sars lasted for approx 6 months in 2003 this one is only just up and running but its not looking good on confirmed cases already, but much better on the percentage of recorded deathsFingers crossed and good luck"
"SwampeastMike #Typhoid MaryJust saying.........If you are calling me ""Thyphoid Mary"" I take great offense. I'm one with high consideration for other when I suspect I have a contagious disease. I isolate myself as much and possible and am particularly cautious regarding hygiene. Of course the ""isolate as much as possible"" becomes difficult when touring on extended holiday. Given the highly variable incubation period of most viral diseases there's no way to say which among us got it first or gave it to the other.I commented in this thread only to report that four visitors to Cambodia and Thailand now all have a very strange and obviously contagious disease while among a great number of fellow tourists from China.None of feel sick enough to seek formal medical treatment--it may just be a really weird cold..."
You are not realGet some medical help you irresponsible personLike yesterday
None of feel sick enough to seek formal medical treatment--it may just be a really weird cold...I really hope for your sake and all those you've come into contact with that that's all it is.
"As do we! Really? What do you do when get ""something"" on holiday and first hear of a strange new disease while on that holiday in an area close to and very popular with tourists from the area it began?"

Will only add that we visited a handful of pharmacies in Siem Reap between Sunday and Tuesday this week. They were all sold out of face masks.
Hi - my son who is 11 and myself are travelling to Cambodia on Tuesday on an organised tour. Travel agents tell me all is safe but I'm really worried... any advice please? Thanks
"Hello AnnMarie25Only that which is already posted to forum.Read and heed the advice of EXPERTS such as WHO, CDC and your national Government Travel Advisory notices and your travel medicine specialist.Taking travel medical advice off this forum from unqualified, self-appointed, ""experts"", who know nothing of your overall health history etc., is a recipe for disaster and no one to blame but yourself.Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad"
Hello BradJillThe common face mask is ineffective for the most part. Please see here.https:/…Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad
Angkorlad - thanks for posting links to news articles about the virus. The articles are helpful and sobering.
"Hello Richard MIt's a pleasure Richard.The informed, intelligent traveller needs facts - up to date facts - and then they can make up their own minds and form their own opinions. Not third party unfounded opinions, biases, prejudices, guestimates or whatever as is so often the case on forum. Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad"
"@AnneMarie25. The current advice from Smartraveller.com.au for Australians travelling to countries other than China where there have been confirmed cases of Coronavirus (which would include Cambodia) includes the following advice: ""Talk to your doctor before travelling with children, if you are pregnant or have a weak immune system.""You can read the Smartraveler recommendations in full here: https:/…novel-coronavirus-outbreakI'm not sure what your country of origin is but it would probably offer the same advice.Edited: 4:41 am, January 30, 2020 "

For a perspective on the current Coronavirus infection and Coronavirus in general this is an excellent interview with the internationally esteemed microbiologist Professor Ellen Jo Baron: https://youtu.be/_yJwSholVHgProf Ellen Jo has been a frequent visitor to Cambodia where she has been involved in training and supporting diagnostic microbiology services in the country. She makes a point in the interview of downplaying the severity of the current epidemic which she maintains is significantly less severe than an influenza epidemic. Hopefully it helps to allay some of the hysteria and misinformation which can be easily spread around an epidemic like this. I would urge those who are concerned to have a listen.

"@POST 37Confirmed cases have now reached approx 10,000She has not got a cat in hells chance of stopping anything now I am afraidI wish her luck all the sameHappy Travels"
Just watched the clip Angelino 53 posted. A must watch !This is solid information that helps cut the hysteria.Thank youCheers
"Two of us just spent three days hospitalized in isolation in Istanbul after developing severe pneumonia following a ""cold"" during our visit to Thailand and Cambodia.Fortunately it was bacterial and not corona virus. We're still not well and are under doctor's orders to spend the next week (the last part of our holiday) in essential isolation.."
"I've been finding out a lot about this situation, and so far there were 100 deaths from this respiratory infection, but in China that is where more than 1000 people died each year from respiratory infections, we would have to think that if it is and you have to take care of yourself, But it's very exaggerated."
"@POST 42You have been finding out a lot about this virus situation you claimI think you had better take another butchers at what is going on Have a look at the real figures and see what the WHO have announcedHappy TravelsEdited: 8:52 pm, January 31, 2020 "
@ Swampeastmike - so you quarantined straight after your Siem Reap trip report (29th Jan) when so many people told you how irresponsible you were being???
"#44 Yes. We were essentially self-quarantining at our friends' home when I got very bad VERY fast. Went to a clinic and told the doctor where I'd been and the symptoms and he told us we HAD to be tested for coronavirus and be hospitalized until the results were discovered. Believe me--you haven't lived until you've been under quarantine in a public hospital in Istanbul during a world health scare. Can you say ""prison"" with workers afraid to come near you unless wearing virtual space suits?"
"Thank you SwampeastMike for having the fortitude to report back on your health as many were concerned. The hospital sounds like an event that will be a good story when you look back on it. Not much fun being sick and away from home but you will recover, have a good story and live to travel another day.Get well soon.Cheers"
SwampeastMike - glad to hear you don't have Corona virus. Get well soon.
"Having had surgery in a third world public hospital, I a, very sorry for your experience, Mike. Glad that you got a proper diagnosis.I am in Siem Reap now. Sadly, the high season looks to be over.I’ll start a new post."
"Travelling from Canada to Cambodia and Vietnam next week. Wear a mask if you wish - it cannot hurt - especially in crowded places. Most important is to wash your hands and elbows for 20 seconds, and sanitize everything before you touch it. and don't touch your mouth, nose and eyes unless your hands are clean. For me the decision to go was based on - 99% of the cases are in China, and of that more than 60% of the cases are in Wuhan. I am not going to Wuhan or anywhere else in China. As more people are confirmed with having the coronavirus - as testing is very back logged - the mortality will likely decrease. it is currently at 2%. Until today all the deaths were in China and we have no information about the health of these individuals prior to the virus, and their nutritional state and health care they received. Globally 1 billion people will get the flu, and of that 3 - 5million will be seriously ill, and 500,000 + will die from influenza. We have a flu vaccine and not everybody chooses to be immunized. The situation with coronavirus is unprecedented, and the global response is unprecedented. You need to decide what your own level of risk is (elderly? travelling with children? immunocompromised? will you be in contact with individuals from Wuhan) and take reasonable precautions."
H5N1 reappears and adds to China and several other countries worries.Details here:https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50686775/outbre…Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad
"Have been in Siem Reap for a week now. There are few to no crowds at Angkor wat, ta prom, kbal spean etc. At some temples we were the only ones there. Place is very quiet. Bayon temple was the busiest with three larger tour groups of about twenty people/ group and people were wearing masks. The quiet at the temples has been a blessing. Hoping for more of the same as we head to phomn phen and vietnam"
"We're home in the USA now and we're still having bizarre night sweats, off-and-on fever, coughs that alternate between dry and productive, unending runny nose and shortness of breath with light activity. A ""cold"" with fever that gets better then becomes acute pneumonia to follow with a more severe ""cold"" all of which have lasted about a month... Very strange."
"Are we still self diagnosing my man, much cheaper than a MD Ha Ha Ha, and thats anywhere but especially where you areYou have either got a lot of staying power or a heart like a lion Good luck"
Awesome. Looking forward to visiting the temples without the crowds. Hope it holds for the next couple of weeks
"Hi, So I am in Siem Reap now and have gotten a cold. No fever. I'm trying to be responsible but the hospitals have no way of testing for coronavirus and could give me ZERO guidance. It seems like you get a fever if you have coronavirus, but I don't know for sure since so many people who carry don't even show symptoms! They told me one hospital can send a sample to Phnom Penh and I should know in a day or two. I'm supposed to fly out tomorrow :-("
"@Maria ""It seems like you get a fever if you have coronavirus, but I don't know for sure since so many people who carry don't even show symptoms!""If you can have coronavirus without symptoms then you can have coronavirus without fever. In all probability you have a cold. There have been NO recorded cases of transmission of coronavirus within Cambodia so far.There was one case in Sihanoukville from a Chinese man who flew in from China and is now cured and one from the cruise ship which docked in Sihanoukville and subsequently tested positive in Malaysia. Obviously I can't rule out you having coronavirus but I don't think hospitals in Cambodia are going to use limited resources to test every patient who comes to them with a cold for coronavirus.Edited: 8:16 am, February 19, 2020 "
If it were me I wouldn't worry. You can catch the virus anywhere and as far as I know there have been no cases in Siem Reap.
"I don't agree with altge above post. Chances you catch this at home is far less than when travelling as you simply come across a lot more people than you do back home. (transportation, restaurant, hotel, places of interest etc.)Plus, if I'd catch the virus I'd rather be in a place with good hospitals and where doctors and nurses speak my language. And finally, not surprising Cambodia has no cases when their hospitals can't even test for Coronavirus. 1 case in the entire country is simply impossible."
