Are they open for dining or just for take out only? Arriving 7/20TIA
Skinny Legs closed at 1 today- hear it is for a couple weeks. LimeOut closed for a day or two is what I read. In Cruz bay most are opened with social distancing- no sitting at bar to just drink.
High Tide and Dave and Jerry's have also voluntarily closed for a bit due to possible exposure. I expect to see these kinds of closures happen frequently and applaud those who do it when they find out they may have had exposure.
Lime out is open. Sam and jacks closed for a few days
Add Greengo’s to the shut down list due to COVID-19 testing.
Tap and Still “until we are able to get everyone tested”
The Terrace has decided to do take out only for the time being.
