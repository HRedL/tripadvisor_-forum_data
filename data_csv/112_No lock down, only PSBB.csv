"PSBB is Big Scale Social Limitation.Starting on April 10, 2020, Jakarta initial to do PSBB, after the proposal of to do PSBB is approved by Ministry of Health. PSBB itself is announced by President.The proposal must declare map of positive Covid-19 patients in the area, note that until nowadays Thousands Islands area, Jakarta is still Nil of Covid-19 patients and logistics and other needs of the people in the area must sufficient.Access to and from Jakarta is still normal, no blockade.Private vehicle can operate with maximum half capacity, means 7-seater vehicle can be filled by maximum 3 persons including driver.Public transportation operate from 0600am to 0600pm only with longer headway and do physical distancing.Traditional markets are still open.Supermarkets, mini markets and shops which sell foods and drinks can still operate from 0900am to 0800pm, exceptsupermarkets in a mall from 1100am.Restaurant can operate for take away and delivery only.People can buy their needs freely.Group more than 5 persons will be dismissed.Work from home, school from home, social/physical distancing and use mask in outside of the house are still applicable, but not PSBB and have done before PSBB.Nowadays there are no panic buying in Jakarta and all of Indonesia, almost no queue. Queue is also in physical distancing.Until nowadays there are 2 from 34 provinces in Indonesia are still free from COVID-19. All provinces have rapid test, so they can do it by themselves.There are possibility proposal from area surrounding Jakarta to do PSBB, but proposal is not means will be approved, if not fulfill the requirements. PSBB is area per area, with only positive Covid-19 patient and has good recovery rate, maybe won't get approval of PSBB.Indonesia is experienced with SARS, MERS and mainly Bird flu. 100 hospitals are already to handle Covid-19, when the Covid-19 initial in Indonesia and all are available since Bird flu. Nowadays Indonesia have more hospitals and also Emergency Hospitals of Covid-19 and relatively empty. In Kemayoran, Jakarta there are 2,000 beds and can expands to 8,000 beds, but maximum use is only 600 beds and nowadays even less than 400 beds.Bali and East Java have good recovery and maybe will flattening the curve soon.South Korea and Taiwan can handle Covid-19 good/well without Lock Down. Even WHO appreciate Taiwan."
"Honestly Sarwa, you are dreaming that Indonesia is flattening the curve.Of course all these so called hospitals are empty, because Indonesia's test rates are amongst the lowest in the world.The fact that Indoensia has the highest mortality rate to numbers infected speaks for itself."

"Dear forum members, the poster named Sarwa is a troll. Please ignore any information he posts re the Coronavirus issue in Indonesia. It is false and dangerous."
Sarwa what you are doing is dangerous. I don't even know why you're on these forums as you constantly post misleading or false info.
"Related to number 3,RI sudah Periksa 19.500 Orang lewat Tes PCR Terkait Covid-19https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2020/04/10/…19,500 tests is only swab test."
"Sarwa, why are you posting in Bahasa? Here is a sobering fact for you. Indonesia has tested .07 people per thousand.https:/…indonesia"
"More interesting facts about Indonesia's ability to handle the pandemic.A 2017 study found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people.You can have all the hospital beds in the world (Indonesia 12 beds per 10,000), but if you can't get people onto a respirator you are facing a vey high death toll."

"Indonesia is not lacks of Covid-19 hospitals/beds.For illustration, Emergency Hospital in Kemayoran, Jakarta has 3,000 beds, but is only used by 335 positive Covid-19 patients, 107 under supervision patients and 51 under monitoring patients. This hospital is only for mild and moderate condition patients and the patients usually will fast in recovery.https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/202004…"
"Indonesia will not have enough beds to cope with Covid on the scale of the U.S, Italy or Spain. That is a fact.Making a point about a 3,000 bed hospital is clearly ridiculous in a country of 27 million people."
"“Updated modelling from University of Indonesia researchers suggests Indonesia could now have a million infected patients, and that more than 120,000 people will die by the end of May if the government does not impose a nationwide lockdown and mass swab testing.”https:/…1b2173a13357bccf22997fc6aeea0fb1"
"Indonesia has about 200 hospitals to handle Covid-19 patients across Indonesia. Even East Nusa Tenggara and Gorontalo has only one positive Covid-19 patient each.Indonesia is an archipelago, so from one island to other island mainly use flight, not as vast area such as USA and Europe. Relatively no high mobility in vast area in Indonesia, so spreading out of Covid-19 is relatively low.Java area is twice than Tasmania area, whereas Bali is only a half of Sydney area."
"One million infected Indonesians. That calculation comes from the experts, not two bit troll who regurgitates government propaganda."
Scary isn't it Sarwa. Tiny islands filled with millions of people. Scarier than NYC.
"140 million people live in Java. Frightening really, given that the virus must be rampant there. I feel for the Indonesians who are hostage to government propaganda and inaction. Those 200 hospitals will amount to nothing when people start dying en-masse. Will you apologise to your fellow citizens then Sarwa, or will you continue telling fairytales?"
"Sarwa, you keep posting links in Indonesian language which is completely useless to most travelers here. Can I suggest you open those links in google and click to translate the pages in future."
Information and statistics coming from official Indonesian sources cannot be relied upon. It’s foreign minister thought that prayer would stop the virus from spreading in the country for heaven’s sake. No foreign government is going to risk taking them at their word on something so critical.
Sarwa makes the outrageous claim that the risk of spreading of Covid-19 in the archipelago is low.Sarwa can you give us more detail about Asia's Ijtima Jamaah Tabligh gathering in Gowa? Another cluster spreading out across Indonesia
"Gowa is in South Sulawesi. South Sulawesi has 222 positive Covid-19 patients, some of it is related with Asia's Ijtima Jamaah Tabligh gathering in Gowa. The gathering itself is cancelled, but many foreign people have visited Gowa, so infection happen, but not much such as in Malaysia with its Tabligh Akbar. Indonesia has also name of Indonesian participants, so tracing has to do, and not spread out to entire of country. So, the important thing is tracing since the beginning.You can read how Indonesia handle of Diamond Princess crew in,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavir…If Indonesia not tested well, so there are possibility many people will get positive Covid-19 infection.Another not too big cluster is happened in West Java, there are 4 clusters, Hipmi cluster, 2 churhes cluster and other cluster. All has been tracing well, however the priest died and his wife got postive Covid-19. So, Jakarta have most positive Covid-19 in Indonesia from imported cases and then local transmission, but seems Jakarta can control it, so local transmission is decreasing.Buleleng Regency in Bali have no local transmission and all patients are concentrate in Singaraja. Some of them got it from foreign countries and some of it got it in outside of Bali, so government has prohibited all of civil servants, polices and army are still stay at Jakarta or not to go home. Ied holidays has also been moved to December 2020.If we do tracing well since beginning, so local transmission will minimum. And if the cases are still in Java mainly in Jakarta and surrounding, so to handle Covid-19 is easier than has spread out to entire of country."
"Yes Sarwa, but they are only contact tracing those who have tested positive. That ignores the fact that any asymptomatic cases could be spreading the virus.Anyway how's that flattening curve working out for you?"
"Sulawesi Tenggara has a population of 2.4 million people but only one hospital is equipped to deal with COVID-19.Flattening the curve, indeed."
"Since March 23, 2020 or 3 weeks ago, Southeast Sulawesi has 7 Covid-19 hospitals,RSUP BahteramasRSUD KendariRSUD Unaaha KonaweRSUD Konawe SelatanRSUD Benyamin Guluh KolakaRSUD BaubauRSUD Raha"
"How many ventilators do these have, Sarwa? How many ICU beds? How much PPE for medical staff?"
"Siloam has so far built 39 emergency hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients across the country. Workers are on site 18 hours a day to complete each hospital in two weeks. Each of the emergency hospitals has an emergency room and a screening center. They also have a special ward for monitoring suspected Covid-19 patients (PDP), another ward for confirmed Covid-19 patients and an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Each room in the Siloam emergency hospitals is negative-pressured to prevent air from escaping outside.https:/…Edited: 2:13 am, April 14, 2020 "

"Hi,Regarding Soulwax’s posts #24/25. Siloam hospital in Bali is now offering private Covid-19 testing on a walk-in basis for 495,000 IDR. Cheers"
Good on Siloam for taking the initiative.
"Can't speak for Siloam In Bali , but have been to their hospital in Karawaci , Jakarta , a few times for dental treatment. Absolutely brilliant . First class hospital , better than some over here in Aus.Edited: 4:54 am, April 14, 2020 "
"Thanks, Soulwax. Great to see Siloam stepping up."
"Rp 495,000, I think it is not PCR, so how about sensitivity and specificity. I want more information.If only test the immunoglobuline, so many clinical laboratories across Indonesia can do it easily."
"Hello Sawa,They are offering Rapid test and swab test from 08:00-18:00 on a walk in basis. If you want more information I suggest you phone them on 0811 123 21520. Cheers"
"Government has given to several hospitals to do Swab Test, but it must be analyze at Sanglah Hospital. The Swab Test itself is free."
"So, you didn’t phone then."
"No, because I have know it before. Indonesia nowadays has 40 laboratories can analyze the swab test and all as I know, are not private hospitals.However, thank you so much for your attention.But, please correct me, if I'm wrong."
Well in this instance you are wrong. Cheers
"Drive Thru in Siloam Hospital is RAPID TEST not SWAB TEST Rp 489,000.Rapid Test through blood is to measure the antibody, there are Dangerous False Negative.https://foto.kompas.com/photo/read/2020/04/1…"
"Hi,There is no drive through test in Siloam. Both Siloam and BIMC do rapid tests and full blood count and X-ray analysis examinations. The tests are from Boizek in Norway. Cheers"
"Drive thru or not is same, Rapid test,Are full blood count and x-ray analysis examination is include Rp 495,000."
"You seemed to spend a lot of time enthusing about rapid tests not so long ago, but now your view is different. The worrying issue is that your government are using rapid tests to screen returning workers to Indonesia, so they must feel they are adequate. These Bali hospitals are offering tests to the worried well with money in most cases, but it’s a reassurance to some I suspect. And knowing these hospital I also suspect that full blood work and x-rays will cost a lot more than 495,000 IDR. Cheers"
"So, as I guess hidden cost, moreover if you must stay there.Rapid test to migrant workers is to screening the positive and the negative. The positive of rapid test must be isolated and then do swab test, the swab test positive or negative they must be still in isolation. The negative of rapid test must be self quarantine for 14 days or depends on the banjar, maybe banjar want all of the migrant workers stay in a house and banjar will watch them. In Java some villages even quarantine their residents for 14 days, if they come from Jakarta without any Rapid test."
How is Indonesia going with producing their own reagents Sarwa?
Can you please stop your misinformation on this forum Sarwa...dont know about others here but I'm getting tired of it. Your post is irrelevant to this forum.It is reported that Indonesia has the highest rate of Coronavirus in South East Asia.
