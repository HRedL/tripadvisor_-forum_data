"I feel the need to share this because my lack of focus is effecting my decision making - this might be the last trip I take. I don't have COVID, traveling won't put me in danger, but I'm young and did not expect to lose my chance at seeing more of this country. Please be kind, I'm sorry if my post is offensive in its lack of details, understand I am dealing with a lot and there is no general forum for travel in the US so this forum was suggested. I have done some preliminary research and just want to hear from others if they know of any other locations I might be interested in. I will iron out the details once I have a list of possibilities, that is up to me. I just want ideas right now. Just destinations that offer what we want, then I can research.-Dates: late June to mid July, we would be traveling for at least 1 week -Have our own car, open to flying then renting-Open to cabin/car camping w/ bathrooms, as well as motels/airbnbs (nothing luxurious)-Open to National/State parks.-Most interested in BOTH hiking (moderate level), and sunbathing by water. -Musuems and surfing are second priority, if open/nearby-4th of July fireworks nice, but low priority-Warm temperatures, nighttime lows 65+-We cannot drive a boatIn general we would like to stay put in one or two areas that have plenty to do rather than drive for days at a time. Some ideas were Big Sur & Yosemite, Biscayne National Park & Virignia Beach, Glen Canyon Arizona. We have visited and loved the Grand Canyon, Zion, Slide Rock Arizona, and Chattanooga. We are not set on any of these, they were just some places that popped up when I was looking for places that offer both hiking and beach/water access. We're looking for any suggestions for locations that meet our criteria. We will be taking COVID restrictions into account. We've got no idea where we want to go, I'm sorry if that's annoying, we just know we want to hike and sunbathe by water in warm weather over all else. Thank you for any comments you decide to leave."
"There really wasn't a need to close your other post and start this new one. You could have amended your original thoughts by simply adding another response to that thread.If you are planning on traveling late June/early July, then you don't have a lot of time to spend researching places. Maybe you should focus on the few places you have listed as possibilities and do a deeper dive in to those areas.  I provided extensive information on your other thread about visiting the Glen Canyon/Lake Powell/Page, Arizona area. But now that you've added the fact that you can't drive a boat, that makes visiting Lake Powell a little more difficult as there's just one place on the lake that's accessible by car, Lone Rock Beach. Note - driving a boat isn't all that difficult. There are many, many people who visit Lake Powell that rent speed boats, houseboats with no prior boating experience.There will be no sunbathing at Yosemite.But it will be hot. Big Sur isn't conducive to sunbathing either. The beach accesses are very rugged. And in northern California, hanging out on the beach to sunbather isn't really a thing. So maybe you should take those places off your list since they are the furthest away from the east coast.There are beaches all along the Gulf Coast. Maybe that area is something you should consider since it's closer to home. There are beaches all along the east coast from Virginia Beach south.You can also post on the destination forums for the states where these places are listed. Post on the Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas forums for more information about beach opportunities in those states."
"Timed out before I could edit.Covid19 restrictions will most likely have an impact on visiting beaches in other states. All the states you may visit will have a website that states current Covid19 restrictions and recommendations. Local municipalities may have additional restrictions regarding Covid 19. Some areas may also restrictions on out of state visitors from Covid19 hot spots like New York City.Also, it's a bit naive to think that traveling won't put you at risk for Covid 19 exposure. It's is still a real threat in many places. In Utah, for example, there's been a significant spike in Covid 19 cases since the stay at home recommendation was relaxed. The area around Lake Powell/Glen Canyon has been heavily hit with Covid19 and has strict curfew and shelter in place restrictions for the Navajo Nation. You need to take appropriate caution with traveling, including wearing a face mask in public.Edited: 12:02 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Follow Connie's excellent advice. During this time of great uncertainty, why try to go somewhere that is restricting visitors. Also, why travel to places that have relaxed their restrictions and are now seeing upticks in the number of cases. You still need to do a lot of research.Post in the Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida forums. Plenty of beaches there with great sunbathing (which seems to be one of your main interests). Get input from the locals who can give you the best advice. If you must travel, take steps to protect yourself. Wear your mask, even when others aren't. Carry hand sanitizer and clean all surfaces you come in contact with. When we traveled recently, we wiped down everything in the hotel rooms including light switches, door handles, etc. We also wipe nozzles at gas pumps. And, above all, we washed our hands thoroughly and used the hand sanitizer liberally."
"Connie: Thank you for letting me know I can rent a boat with no boating experience and that some of the areas I was considering are not conducive to sunbathing, as well as east coast states with beach access.  I thought perhaps I could visit one place for hiking, and one place for sunbathing, with a reasonable drive between both. But because I do not know which locations would offer both of those things within a reasonable distance, I decided to come here and ask. When I googled hiking and beaches, Biscayne and Glen Cove were both reaults. I am not married to any of the places I listed, was just using them as examples that articles online provided. This isn't quite what I had in mind, but for instance, Vegas has reopened and they have pools and sunbathing, and there are hiking opportunities nearby. It's that sort of two destination trip that I was considering if we couldn't find everything in one spot. I did not say that I would not be at risk for catching covid, I merely meant to convey that my prognosis does not include any condition that would put me at an increased risk for contracting COVID, such as respiratory problems. I have every intention of following traveling restrictions, including wearing a mask, as I do everyday when I leave the house, and have been keeping an eye on sites that list reopened states experiencing spikes. We will travel responsbily or not at all ❤️"
"I was only posting to get a list of destinations that meet our criteria, and then planned on researching each destinations restrictions. I have no desire to travel to a place I shouldn't - but when Googling ""hiking and beaches"", or when asking friends, the example destinations I listed we're those provided to me. Because many of these resources have not been updated since COVID, this is definitely a process of elimination. Thank you for the individual state suggestions.To further clarify about my health status, my prognosis does not put me at an increased risk for catching COVID (no respiratory issues for example), however that does not mean that I am cavalier. In my day-to-day life I already sanitize my groceries, carry hand sanitizer, wear a mask in public, have limited social contact, etc. Those precautions will be taken even more seriously while traveling."
"If you are desiring a couple of destinations where you can hike in one place and sunbath, be near water in another, then look at going to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and Page. There's plenty of hiking at the South Rim and it won't be unbearably hot (something to consider when hiking). You would fly in to Phoenix (or if you want a really long driving trip, drive from NYC). The only issue I see with visiting the South Rim right now would be getting hotel reservations on short notice. You could possibly add in a couple of nights in Sedona Arizona for more hiking. But Sedona will be very hot.Here's a plan to consider:Day 1: Fly from NYC to Phoenix. Overnight north of Phoenix.Day 2: Drive to Page, Arizona. 4 hour drive. No stopsDay 3: Day on Lake Powell - rent a boat from Wahweap Marina $600 a day plus fuel and deposit. Or do Glen Canyon float trip. Or spend day at Lone Rock Beach.Day 4: Drive to South Rim Grand Canyon. Stop at Horseshoe Bend in route. 3 hour drive, no stopsDay 5: Hiking at Grand Canyon or drive to Sedona 2 hour driveDay 6: Hiking in Sedona Day 7: AM in Sedona. Return to Phoenix for flight home. 2 hour drive, no stops.If you happen to decide on this plan, you need to be fully prepared for the intense heat while hiking. You will want plenty of water (a hydra back pack is the best option), a hat with a full brim that secures under your chin. You will want to limit hiking to early mornings or later afternoon/evening. Do not under estimate the effect heat will have on you doing outdoor activities.The above is just one idea. But you will need to get cracking on making hotel reservations, etc. if you decide this is where you want to go. Hopefully, others will be along with ideas for other places.Edited: 12:59 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Connie this is fantastic, thank you ❤️ I've done the South Rim, Horseshoe, and Slide Rock in Sedona a few summers ago - you basically recreated that trip haha! I'm not opposed to going a second time :)"
"I had no way of knowing that you had been there before since you haven't previously shared that information. And laying around in the hot sun at Lake Powell isn't all that great. It's blazing hot - daytime temps can easily be above 100 degrees. When we go to Lake Powell on our houseboat, no one lays around sunbathing unless they are floating on a mat on the lake. And that doesn't last very long either. It's just too darn hot. It's the water sports that's the draw at Lake Powell. So maybe you should just focus on going somewhere on the east coast.Edited: 1:34 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Both long distance driving and flying can be stressful.  Since you've been to the West, I'd consider Georgia.  You can go to the ocean or even an inland lake with a beach, like Lake Lanier, which should be plenty hot.  Just take a short drive north to the mountains for hiking.Edited: 2:10 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Oh I did mention in my post that I had been to the Grand Canyon, Zion, and Slide Rock (second paragraph from the bottom), but you mapped out a lovely intinerary regardless! And if we really wanted to, we could always try to incorporate Vegas into some of those locations to have an opportunity for sunbathing. But I will definitely be looking into East Coast options as well."
"Is Hawaii in your budget? Amazing beaches, sunbathing, marine life, and all sorts of hiking..waterfalls, tropical rain forests, etc etc. Hawaii literally has it all, but it would involve a long flight and is super expensive.What about combining a hiking trip in the Great Smokey Mountains with a road trip to the Florida panhandle for some amazing white sand beaches? Maybe a combination of Asheville, NC for hiking, and the Outer Banks in NC for beaches?The challenge is finding warm weather beaches (for sunbathing, swimming, etc) that has hiking trails in the vicinity that wouldn't be miserably hot!!"
"Vegas will be fry an egg on top of the car hot in July. One of the last places I would want to be in July. But then I have no use for Vegas any time of the year.Yes, you did mention your Grand Canyon Sedona trip AFTER I proposed a possible itinerary. Still think you should stick to the east coast destinations. The southwest is miserably hot in July.Edited: 2:43 pm, June 18, 2020 "
"Re the post in #11, Hawaii would be a better choice for 2021 or later. Currently there are very few flights going there because there is still a 14-day required quarantine in place until the end of July. Our COVID numbers are low and we intend to keep it that way."
>>There will be no sunbathing at Yosemite.<<Yes there will. That's just wrong. There are folks enjoying the sun and the rivers right now. Sunbathing is definitely an option. It's especially fun to relax in the sun in an inflatable tube. Getting lodging or campsite or Day Use permit reservations for Yosemite is much a bigger challenge.
"So, at least one week, your other said 3 weeks. You didn't want to drive much, now are open to driving. Big difference. I understand you are uncertain, but we can throw out a million places and if you really just want to drive a day or two, hike a place or two along the way, and then lay on the beach for a week or more, day trip to hike close to the beach for a couple days and drive a day or two back, that matters."
"I've heard lovely things about Georgia, and have been to Savannah, I'd love to see more of the state! Thank you for the suggestions :)"
"Connie I'm very confused, in my original post I mentioned I had been to these places, not in a comment. I'm not sure how I could have mentioned it AFTER you posted your itinerary if it's in the body of my post? I did not edit this post after posting it."
"PacificNwfamily: Yosemite did come up as a suggestion for a beach/hiking combo, and I would love to see a national park (I haven't been to many!). Glad to hear people do sunbathe there! I'll keep it on the list and see what's available, thank you :)"
"Thbergs: I'm open to driving and flying, and for traveling for ""at least"" a week, but can do longer. I'd prefer to not spend 2 weeks driving, but if I fell in love with a destination across the country and plane travel wasn't an option, I'd make it work. But it's more practical to either drive somewhere closer, or fly somewhere and rent a car. For the sake of the post maybe I provided unnecessary details that should have stayed inside my head. In short yes, I'd love to fly/drive somewhere warm, hike some days, drive to another place, lay about on the beach/water a bunch, then fly/drive back. That's the gist of it, if there's not a one stop shop location that's got it all."
"No need to get worked up about it. I missed it and wasn't looking at your original post when I wrote that comment. No big deal,OK. I hope you are able to figure out where you are headed in a couple of weeks."
You could combine the Outer Banks (NC - beaches) and the Smokies (NP - mountains/hiking); Asheville is a great city close to the Smokies to check out as well.
"Hey Connie, no worries, I just wanted to make sure I wasnt missing anything (sometimes I do). I really appreciate all your feedback and comments :) I know no matter where we go I'll be thrilled!"
Rjr: Thanks! :)
"If your beach doesn't have to be an ocean (I'm a navy brat... so that's my default thinking:) You could consider somewhere along Lake Michigan or Lake Superior. Door County, Wisconsin, or somewhere in the Upper Peninsula (Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore), or Sleeping bear dunes and the surrounding area of Michigan. Beautiful country there, and there are ""beaches"" ... most are rocky but you can find sandy ones, and the area actually has a lot of sand dunes (also waterfalls, thus great hiking opportunities). On my first visit, I couldn't believe the water was ""lake water"" because it was crystal clear and a beautiful turquoise or green in many places...not unlike the Caribbean. I was in the UP ""the yoop"" last summer and it was in the 90's during the day (it was actually hotter up there than it was in my home state of Texas some days!) so sunbathing wouldn't be a problem. I saw people swim in Lake Michigan (NOPE) .I hope you have a great trip!"
"Olliein: My beach definitely doesn't have to be the ocean lol! That area never even occurred to me, and I had no idea it got so hot. Lake Michigan is in the 80s right now. RE: your ""NOPE"", a quick Googling tells me Lake Michigan often isn't good for swimming due to bacteria and waves? I'm not much into swimming but I do dip in to cool off after lazing around the sun - should I focus on the other areas you mentioned? My partner definitely likes swimming!"
"It's all right here is a neatly wrapped little package. Sunbathing ( a naturist area) and clothed. Hiking, and beautiful sand dunes. Local seafood to die for. Think the Cape Cod of the Midwest minus the loud city people.https:/…Edited: 5:36 pm, June 18, 2020 "
Eric I think you just described paradise! And nude friendly areas? That's one of my favorite things!
I kinda had a feeling. Hope you have fun. Take plenty of sunblock!
"Lake Erie is the warmest of the Great Lakes. From ny stste beaches you aren’t far from mountains Other lakes are cold until late August.In Burlington you have lake Champlain near the mountains.Warm water beaches are only in the SE Atlantic, gulf coast. San Diego and LA water temps are in the upper 60s."
"""Cape Cod of the Midwest, minus the loud city people""...Eric that is perfect! I don't know if you coined that phrase, but I love it. The Door County peninsula was one of my favorite travel finds ever! Growing up with a Naval officer meant we never were allowed to consider anyplace without an ocean...LOL! Whitefish dunes, Cave point county park , Peninsula state park, wineries, cherry orchards, cheese curds...Door County is Heaven!Edited: 12:51 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"@Ollie...Yeah, I coined it,:-) I actually lived and worked on the Cape. It's great from Labor Day until Memorial Day. I visit Door County often, and love it as well. You did leave out the fish boil! I'm a USN guy myself...served in a VP squadron during Vietnam out of Okinawa and Cam Ranh Bay. Were you ever in the DC area as a brat? I grew up in Langley, VA"
"I lived in Fairfax, VA for 2 years!My dad was a bubble head:)Saratoga Springs, NYMystic Connecticut Charleston, SCSan Diego OahuThose are the ones I remember! When my dad retired we moved to San Antonio!"
