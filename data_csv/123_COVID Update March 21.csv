"SORRY - Update March 31We're a week into the lockdown and developments are starting to materialize rapidly. I've been working with our own team members to get information, but also other journalists. A couple things to note about Nepali journalism:- The reports you read are poorly researched. Nepali journalists don't dig, but rather wait for the news to fall on their heads. They also will never publish anything that could draw negative attention from the government. The news we're reading does not fully illustrate the evolving scene.New developments:- The NTB has done a great job of organizing evacuations for stranded tourists. As of today they may have helped as many as 1,500 people get back to Germany, France, Australia, and the first US flight is scheduled for today. Seats on these planes were priced at roughly $2500, so not cheap. - The lockdown in Kathmandu is fiercely enforced. In Pokhara we don't see many people out, nor much need for police enforcement. Pokhara is sealed tight with only a few markets open.- Anyone hoping to move around from city to city must get approval, which seems impossible to obtain.COVID Cases- There is a flood of misinformation spawn by the news. They are quick to report of suspected cases and tests administered, but do a crap job of follow through. Needless to say, I blame the media on any panic setting in. We currently know of four active cases, although even that is highly unlikely. If we have 4 here, we have 400. There have only been 1,000 tests, or really just 800 as some people were tested twice.- The cases reported are the result of government inaction to quarantine national returning from Europe and the UAE. The government neglegence is appalling. While tourists were expected to quarantine on arrival, more than 800 nationals arrived in KTM and then boarded domestic flights, buses, and flooded the rural areas. And so it begins. Expect thousands of cases soon.- The biggest threat is amassed on the border with India. Aside from thousands of Indians trying to get into Nepal, more than 500 national are also trying to get through. They are literally, stacked in huge mobs, shoulder to shoulder, likely infecting each other. When that torrent gets through, it's all over.So, as much as Nepal's government is trying to take action, controlling only 75% of the situation, and leaving 25% unchecked, is the problem. For now the next lockdown extension date is for April 15. I suspect it won't matter once the border gets invaded by a thousand infected nationals and Indians. Which is inevitable.For those of you planning trips to Nepal in October-December, don't. This situation is about to get a million times worse.Edited: 11:48 pm, March 30, 2020 "
Hi QuitouThanks for the update. I saw some photos of the mobs on the border and as you say once they get in all control over the epidemic is gone. Her in New Zealand the government is suggesting that all foreign travel should be delayed by a year to eighteen months anyway so I guess I'll have to sit at home for a while.EricMy Nepal Pages https://wanderingeric.org/category/nepal/
"Thank you for the update.If compared to the spanish flue starting in 1918, it took 2 years before it stopped. I fear we may be looking at the same time line with corona. This virus has caught the world by surprise and many countries underestimated it including Denmark."
"Maj, this is right but now nobody knows what brings the future.- I'm still full of hope to realize my travel plans from this year March / April to the coming autumn."
"Toni S I hope you are not disappointed.I just long for the time when you can leave your home without fearing the virus, or for my hairdresser to be open for business again. It is the small things."
"It’s terrible, the world has been asleep at the wheel, governments, the public, corporates, faiths, the medical pandemic experts have warned of it for years with many close calls like MERS, SARS, Ebola and H1N1 influenza in only the last 20 years. It’s likely to wipe away national budgets and economies and bankrupt many nations and go on for a few years. The countries that are able to control it initially will be in border lockdown for years until enough countries outside that can’t do anything else have achieved herd immunity the painful and costly way significant fatalities and failed economics, which will in turn create secondary welfare problems. Hopefully early drug treatment in the short term and possible vaccine in 18 months most hopeful result but more likely 5 years will arrive as many experienced in that field are suggesting.Best to find a quiet and safe corner somewhere to wait this out for 2 years or more, and try to do something to help in the mean time.With my line of work in environmental health we are waiting for further instructions from government to assist in contact tracing of infected persons, with eyes and ears to the ground to report problems to front line quarantine and community enforcement of lockdown rules."
"@toni s, Here in Nepal we're just at the onset of what could be a protracted epidemic. The key here is how unprepared Nepal is for something like this. Sitting here today, I feel like this is really all up to fate, the gods, luck, whatever you want to call it. The tools in place today to keep the virus in check will be quickly overwhelmed within days if the spread follows every trend elsewhere in the world.Right now there are 1,000 people on the Indian border, some likely infected, all itching to spread out all over Nepal's poorest, and most rural areas. What does that mean for the fall?It's anyone's guess what the tourism infrastructure will look like. Tourism was already down in the fall of 2019. People and officials say otherwise, but they're flat out wrong. To have this season wiped from the books, means a vast portion of the tourism industry will not open in the fall, even if, the virus is abated by then. Add to that a global economy unable to feed money into Nepal's travel industry, and many of us in the industry here think it could be fall of 2021 before things regain any kind of normality.I think anyone ""planning"" to come here in the fall is taking a bad gamble. March 2021 seems more logical. Given what we're seeing in other parts of the world, I think there's a very high possibility the virus could be still gripping Nepal well into 2021."
"Severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing equipment/kit and ventilators are major problems in the UK, and I think it is similar in the US. Problems vary from country to country. It is definitely not all hunky-dory here re medical resources. Currently no one has any clue as to the likely duration of this - including possible flares ups post any apparent improvement. Economic impact: it is already very severe, which has raised questions about the wisdom of the lockdowns. Most (all) investment/funding decisions in my line of work have stopped, and many firms are already facing severe cashflow issues. Most people do not realise how utterly dependent on flows (of cash, services and things) a modern society is - they are now finding out (I was going to say that the penny is dropping, to use a common expression)."
"What is the situation now of the many thousand Nepali workers in the Middle East, mostly Qatar ? Are they stranded there ? Are there plans for their return ?Revenue from workers abroad was the #1 source of hard currency for Nepal, in front of tourism."
"Pierre W Nepal is refusing migrant workers at the Indian Nepalese border entry into the country. Qatar air has been airlifting tourists out of Nepal, but no permission to carry passengers into Nepal, so think it is safe to say they are stranded. Migrant workers in Kathmandu have no jobs, no money and no food and have started walking back to their villages.In my country we do our best to get our citizenz back home whereever they are stranded, I do not believe that is the case in Nepal. It is heading for disaster.One of our well renowed danish tour operaters donated from their relief fond to their nepalese guides and drivers. Maybe a thought for concern when we want to travel as cheap as possible."
"""What is the situation now of the many thousand Nepali workers in the Middle East, mostly Qatar ?""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/qatar…I hope this is true...Aljazeera is owned by the government of Qatar so I am not sure that their reporting is accurate."
"I hope the news on the link that you posted is true Jean (post 10)– We know that the wages earned by Nepali migrant workers will be supporting extended family’s back at home, so if they are still being paid during periods of quarantine, then this will help reduce the suffering of their families.Best WishesRob"
