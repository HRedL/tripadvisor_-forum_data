Are you ready to stay under house arrest for the next 18 + months?
"This would not totally surprise me. I assume any release from lockdown should be gradual, and in careful phases ... and that those who are most susceptible should be last, and possibly not until there is a vaccine. It would be a drastic change for people, and incredibly difficult, financially, emotionally and otherwise. Very scary and stressful times, so much is unknown."
"It wouldn’t surprise me but whether it’s sustainable for possibly 18months is another matter. It’s not just elderly but also the highly vulnerable group and most probably the vulnerable group. In the UK, if you’ve self isolated for 12weeks you are still vulnerable after life returns to some sort of normality. I can foresee that my self isolation may last longer and I will have to decide what risks I’m willing to take. It’s certainly going to take a long time to get out of lockdown to anything like normality."
"It is not an official position of the EU, just something Ursula Von Der Leyen said. Besides, as we could already observe, the EU hasn't got a voice in this matter, each country decides its own policy.Apart from that, of course I find it unacceptable. I think many 'ekderly' people might prefer dying."
"Source you are referring to?I doubt that anybody demanded a house arrest for the elderly. It is clear, however, that risk groups will have to be particularly careful until a vaccination is ready to be widely distributed."
And what about young people with underlying conditions? Will they be under house arrest too?
"Here comes a source https://europost.eu/en/a/view/von-der-leyen-… but it is in all newspapers.I think U.Von der Leyen should rather shut up, and rather plan how the EU will survive.Besides it is completely unrealistic. Right now, we see many retirement / nursery / care homes have been contaminated, I don't see how it can be prevented if the virus is allowed to spread in the younger population to reach the herd immunity.If she is in favor of the herd immunity, she should rather tell the truth: millions of people, mostly over 70, will die. Maybe there isn't any alternative.Edited: 10:05 am, April 12, 2020 "
Funny. I’m sure I fit most definitions of elderly. I also have an “underlying” illness that makes me more “vulnerable”. I doubt any “elderly” prefer to die as suggested by #3 but at least in my case I don’t intend on being cooped up longer than anyone else. My underlying condition is progressive. I’m only complying to protect others. I don’t intend to stay isolated just to protect me I’ve got a life to live before my health incapacitates me. I’m sure other “elderly” don’t want paternalistic protection thru isolation.
"Nowhere is she speaking of „house arrest“, though. I‘d appreciate if such alarming wordings were avoided. The measures discussed are serious enough."
"“elderly may have to be kept isolated”That wording and the rest of the article talks about “kept”. “We have to limit”. She does not say “they need to isolate themselves” but that “someone (we) must keep them isolated”. Maybe it isn’t house arrest but it sounds much like it. The elderly and vulnerable need the freedom to decide for themselves.Edited: 11:51 am, April 12, 2020 "
"I have diabetes, under control, but who knows if that will last the rest of my life? So far it hasnt slowed me down. I am not ""elderly"" yet but on my way, like many others. I do not want to be ""held in isolation"" any longer than necessary. I already know I will be super cautious once the govt. and health dept experts say it's ok to start resuming life. I trust nobody. I'm glad I am content to stay in my house, I've got a great house and large property, so it's not a big deal - so far. But it may become that way, we'll see. I dont want to have to sit around my house and wait indefinitely to die."

"DayTrip, it is quite sad to se that there are people in this world like you."
I'd just love to know what anyone gets out of trying to disrupt discussions on a travel website. It just doesn't make any sense to me.
"I am in a similar position to PfD. I too have a condition that is progressive. I have already had 8 months of travel stolen from me while doctors faffed about with medication and just as I went on what I was told was a short list (less than 6 weeks) for a treatment with a considerably better than even chance of giving me a couple or so of pretty good years, Covid 19 came along and has probably turned weeks into months and months.I'm certainly not going to let any politician lock me up when others can work and travel."
"No I would not do it. I am 69 and have heart condition but is manageable with meds. I go to grocery stores and home improvement stores, but I always wear a mask and most people in my area are also wearing masks.Right now my husband is undergoing treatment for cancer so he is very vulnerable and doesn't go out except for his treatments. After he has recovered, we plan to take a long road trip in our RV where we can easily social distance from the rest of the world, except for occasional groceries. We will get gas at the pump. We will be going to see beautiful scenery and not participating in activities where there are big crowds or lines.Not willing to spend what time we have left in isolation, so we will just be as careful as we can."
"My 90 years old Dad and 87 years old Mom never missed a day of walking during the lockdown and are certainly not planning to stay inside. They even started doing grocery shopping themselves. To lock them inside their apartment would be a death sentence to them and I will not let it happen. We have resumed visiting them every week a month ago - so far, so good."
"There has been a lot about peoples mental health during lockdowm, but not much about physical problems. Lack of exercise for the old could prove catastrophic for the elderly. Not all have access to gardens to stroll around and certainly in my part of London, the lockdown was observed for less than a week. With everyone taking an enforced holiday there are far more people on the streets than usual and virtually none practice social distancing.Of course for many the old are expendable, toxic ageism is becoming rife.Edited: 10:32 am, June 07, 2020 "
"Being up there in age, wouldn't that be depressing having to stay in isolation. No, couldn't do it...we love to be out and about. If we are near others, always wear a mask, and we go on excursions in the car, and will continue to do so. As I said before, right now, nothing beats going to the lake, sitting there having a coffee....very peaceful. In fact, probably going golfing soon, they just opened up."
"OH has just been 'told' to do another 12 weeks shielding, so I will do it, as well. Very difficult, if we can see it through, we'll have done 6 months in isolation. If you'd asked me at the beginning, I'd have said absolutely no way..........but we have now lost two relatives to this dreadful virus. It is real, it kills lovely people, therefore we will do whatever we have to do, to try and survive it."
"There must be differences between countries because here the over 70-year-olds were never told they could not go for a walk. In fact quite the opposite, if I remember correctly."
"Here, the over 70s were just advised to stay indoors if they could but they weren't told they couldn't go out."
"Those that were considered high risk, Cancer, Diabetes, etc. were asked to remain indoors. My OH received several letters and texts from the Govt...........he wasn't even allowed out to the bins!!"
"Well, being in the USA, I do not worry about the EU, or China, and their lapdog, the WHO.While I might, or might not agree with the edicts/proclamations, I get to ignore them.Hunt"
"Here in the Philippines (admittedly not EU) we have been locked down since mid March. We just started a slow relaxation of the quarantine. But under 21 and over 60 are still not allowed out, unless there is no one else to shop for them (or for work). Also the Department of Education just recommended school stay closed until a vaccine is found. Looks like we are just taking a year off.I am only 56 but been gray since high school, so I get asked about my age everywhere I go. And for a country of over 100 million people we have just barely 20,000 cases so far. We must be doing something right. Better safe than sorry."
"@Tito Tim Travels #26, why do under 21s have to stay inside in the Phillipines? From what we read here in Australia, very few young people get this virus and if they do they are either asymptomatic or get a very mild version.My parents and in-laws are all over 70, closer to 80 in most cases, and they have all stayed inside, but I don't believe there is any rule that they should, it is simply commonsense. Now however, when we barely have 50 cases in the whole country, it is probably time for them to get back to the real world.@algarveaddict2015, I am so sorry for your loss. I am really starting to thing that the virus that is hitting the UK and the US, and Italy and Spain etc. might be a totally different beast to what we have in Australia and New Zealand. We have only had just over 100 deaths in the entire country and I can't believe that our government has done that much of a better job than others. Admittedly being an island helps, but then so is the UK, but for some bizarre reason they didn't shut their borders."
"Thank you, djh1. Both were elderly but still taken too soon. I wish they'd restricted the movements of the under 21's here in the UK. Many of them selfishly continued their lives as if it were a joke. Continued to meet, party etc. without any acknowledgement of social distancing or the consequences of their actions. I cannot understand why the Govt. allowed millions back, during Feb/March, from high risk countries. Many expats returning from Europe, who hadn't been back in years. I can only assume because of the NHS. I know of one family of eight, who returned purely because of the high cost of medical expenses, they could of incurred in their adopted country. We also brought millions of holidaymakers back from Spain, Italy, France etc. without any tests or quarantine. If the anti bodies do prove to give some immunity, then we will at least, be one of the 'safer' countries.Edited: 5:54 am, June 08, 2020 "
"Actually most of the deaths are elderly people who stayed in isolation, and that's what killed them. 70% of the deaths in Belgium are care home residents ! (And a similar although less extreme result in France, Sweden, Spain ...).Abiut the young people, they have paid too high a price already. Quite normal that some of them refused to comply.Edited: 6:17 am, June 08, 2020 "
How are care home residents in isolation?
"@djh1 They say here that the kids that do catch it are more likely to be sicker or die easier. Young & old are both considered high risk. I am not saying they are right... but that is what they say.The rules are written very poorly too. Not only can you not go out if you are under 21, over 60, or have any autoimmune issues (or any health risk)... you cannot go out if you live with any of those people. Which means 99% of the people in the country should not be allowed out. It is not enforced that way, but it is written that way."
"AstraZeneca’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines are going into Phase 3 testing, so maybe we will not be waiting for 20 years as someone thinks."
""" you cannot go out if you live with any of those people. ""Which is the only thing that makes sense. Most people are in closer contact with those they live with than with any random stranger. If people are really at risk you need to isolate them."
"Sorry, but the Philippines authorities lie. You can search the web and find lots of scientific evidence that children are very low risk, actually less risk than the seasonal flu."
"@Pierre W, yes that's what they say here in Australia. We have only had around 104 deaths and none of them are children, they are all elderly, and usually sick too.We have had a couple of children catch it in the last month or so, but they don't seem to be very sick at all.I really can't see how you can expect people to be locked up for months or years, they might as well already be dead!"
You have different issues.Are the kids getting ill? Then you need to protect the kids.Are the kids healthy carriers? Then you need to protect the fragile people they come into contact with. The point of the elderly going into isolation is because they have a high risk of ending up in the hospital. But no point have grandparents in isolation if they're grand kids are spreading the virus.
"Here in Illinois, roughly the same number of people under 20 and 80+ have tested positive for the virus (8,000-9,000 people in each category). Four reported deaths for those under 20, while 2,641 deaths for those 80+. I believe that nearly 70% of Covid deaths here are people who are 70+."
"""problem is that only 45% of people even get a flu shot and . what makes you think they'll get a coronavirus shot?""Here in the UK for the aged group 65+ the uptake rate in in excess of 72%Personally, I think the uptake of any corona virus vaccine would be much higher across all age groups because of the media coverage the deaths have quite rightly hadDo you have the flu jab J&D and would you have a corona virus shot if one was available?"
I have to admit I've never had a flu jab but I would have a Corona virus jab if one was available.
"Traveller #41,We have always gotten the flu shots.In my wife’s case, it is mandatory, as no employee, in any of her hospitals, can have contact with any patient, if they have not had a flu shot.Then for us, with a lot of travel, and much of it international, plus our ages, we have a higher than normal risk quotient.If a COVID vaccine does become available, we will most likely take that too.Hunt"
"I had never had a flu shot until two years ago. Our daughter-in-law thought it best since we would be spending time with our very young granddaughter. Our DIL is a pharmacist, and I respect her opinion & will continue getting one. My husband has always had a flu shot since his employer provides one free at the workplace."
"I receive a flu shot every fall, as they are free to get in Canada. Many jobs now require that you must receive the flu shot every year."
"Hunt.I used to work in a private hospital and we were offered a flu jab every winter. It was not mandatory for clinical or non clinical staff. I haven't worked there for 5.5 years now, so not sure if guidelines have changed."
"I get my flu shot every year and will get Covid vaccine when it is available. It is for sure for my own protection, but also to help with herd immunity to protect people who cannot get their vaccinations for medical reasons. I guess that will protect anti-vaxxers too!"
"Traveller #45,I would imagine that the policies will differ by institution and region.I can only relay what my wife’s hospitals require, in AZ, USA.Hunt"
"I have been getting the flu jab for many years, even before I qualified for the free jab.I am self employed and if I am not working, I am not earning any money. I also am lucky enough to love my work almost all the time.Many younger people in my chambers don't bother with the flu vaccine. I am very busy during flu season as I not only have my own work, but theirs as well.Yes. I will get the Covid 19 vaccine when it is available."
"I believe if a CV-19 vaccine becomes available, then it may be mandatory in order to fly.Yes, we would get vaccinated.Edited: 3:28 am, June 13, 2020 "
"I would hope if a vaccine that actually works is released, that it would be compulsory to be vaccinated. That would be the only way to wipe it out.I have had the flu shot every year since I was in my early 20s. We have to pay for it here, until you are over 65, but to me it is worth every penny. I have only had the real flu twice, and I don't ever want to get it again.I would certainly get a covid-19 vaccination if it was available.Edited: 4:08 am, June 13, 2020 "
We don't need 100% but the closer the better. I think herd immunity kicks in around 80%. The big thing is to limit the spread. One person gets it sad for them. They give it to ten people that's much worse. But if the majority of people have the vaccine then it won't spread very easily.
I would hope all the critical vaccinations were compulsory but they aren't and therefore some kids still don't get the necessary vaccinations.
Some kids can't. They are too weak/unhealthy to risk the vaccine or they have allergies. They are still protected if the vast majority get it. The problem is when the number of people getting it drops too low.
Hi againWhat people need to remember about the flue vaccine is that it only provides protection again certain flu strains and not every flu virus so it is quite possible for you to have the flue or a cold when you have had the flue jab
"nzentena, that's very understandable, I just meant families where the adults have anti-vaccine beliefs."
"""The problem is when the number of people getting it drops too low.""This is where I have problem with anti-vaxxers. Herd immunity, which protects people who cannot have vaccine for medical reasons, cannot be obtained if there are too many anti-vaxxers. Do they know that their children are protected because responsible people get the vaccine, the one they are against?"
