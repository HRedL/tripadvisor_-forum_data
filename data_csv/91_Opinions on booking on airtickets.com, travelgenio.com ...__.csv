"Hey,Momondo and Skyscanner often find cheap tickets at airtickets.com, travelgenio.com, travel2be ...What are your experiences with these websites, are they legitimate and safe to book air tickets with?I found some (not so good) opinions about airtrip.com on this forum, but I cannot find anything useful about above mentioned websites (maybe I have overlooked it?)Many thanks for your answers!Edited: 7 years ago "
always book direct with the airlines. 'Cheap' tickets usually turn out to be anything but.
"That seems to be the easiest answer (thanks though!), but seriously - did anybody already use those websites and have first-hand information about them?Edited: 7 years ago "
"Never use them, always search out deals on the website of the airlines I check to find the best deal with the aiirlne then see if my friendly local travel agent can equal or beat the price, they always can equal or beat the price.Problem with those 3rd party websites ( and I have looked at them ) is that often you get some cheap fare but routing / connections etc are not good, or, you are not seeing all the options. Hence never use them.Edited: 7 years ago "
Their homepage seems to indicate I can get a fligth (their spelling not mine) from 6£ to Paris and the Baleares. Wow that almost sounds too good to be true.Edited: 7 years ago 
"Travelgenio's payments page (frequently asked questions) is pretty scary reading as well, they seem to be reassuring the victim sorry I mean client ""hey don't panic if we charge you twice for the same transaction, it's only a glitch which we will sort out sometime, maybe"" Airtickets.com looks like they operate out of an accommodation address and I can't find any record of them or their management company Airtickets Travel Services Ltd at companies house Well I had my say!!!"
"often you get some cheap fare but routing / connections etc are not good <<<<<So very true. Just researched a fare from U.K. to India, for a friend who of the older generation does not have PC. Some of the cheaper options through the third party sites had horrendous connection times of upto 20 hours. Then there are credit card charges - booking direct with airline often involves no charges for credit card booking. Getting bit boring repeating 'always book direct with airline'"
"Just because you've found a cheap site via a reputable meta-search engine, does not mean that company is reliable. It's akin to you saying ""I found it on Google, so it must be great"". If there were such great third party sites, everybody would be talking about them, and you would have heard of them. Either that or you're the very first person to have found such an amazing site for cheap airline tickets.I wouldn't use them, but that's just me."
"""Some of the cheaper options through the third party sites had horrendous connection times of upto 20 hours. Then there are credit card charges - booking direct with airline often involves no charges for credit card booking""- - -I think that is completely irrelevant since you can clearly see that at Skyscanner or Momondo already and eliminate such unsuitable combinations of flights before you even start with the booking procedure.But after reading all other arguments, you convinced me somehow. However, I don't like generalised answers too much, I was asking about first-hand experiences specifically with above mentioned websites (eg. do you get valid tickets after the payment is processed?). Thanks anyway.Edited: 7 years ago "
If you think horrendous connections times and high credit card charges are irrelevant then go ahead and book - good luck.I am sure that well over 90 pct of bookings with these sites are without problems. The problems arise if you want to cancel/amend or need any sort of customer assistance - which is non existent with a lot of these sites.Edited: 7 years ago 
"You do not need to be convinced by our generalized answers. Try it out, and let us know how you went."
"I was talking about connection times (you can see them transparently well in advance, before booking). You can find unreasonable long connection times also when you're booking via carrier's website. CC charges may be an issue, I agree."
"Just because one person may state they never had problem with one of these sites, does not mean anything. Any long standing contributor to this site will tell you, Matej, that third party sites are fraught with potential problems.You may get a handful of posters jump up and say they never had problems with these sites, that does not mean you will not. If you are looking for reassurance booking through one of these sites then you will not find it on here."
"i just booked flight Europe to Asia on www.airtickets.com ..my outgoing flight is on 25.09.2013.,i wanted return date 30.05.2014...instead they gave me return date only two days later on 27.09.2013. !!! i was schoked,since then they not reply on phone,email or skype..also they publish low prices of airtickets,but when you want to buy it, they report is ,,zerro availability,, i tried to book my ticket at list 10 times,finaly i got wrong dates...be carefull when booking ticket with such scary websites,i have to wait to see if they replay on my request for date change and what will happen..."
"I totally agree with previous answers saying that as often as u can only book on companies websites. I just booked a flight with travel2be / travelgenio and this was such a wrong idea. Me and 4 friends out 6 who had booked the same flight received this message the day after (translated from - already bad - French):Message from 8/10/13 2:46 p.m. >>>> From: ""Travelgenio"" >>>> cc: >>>> Subject: [Travelgenio - Cancellations]>>>>>>>> Hello >>>> The book you ordered from us yesterday that can not be issuance. Does not exist an agreement between the companies. this is the reason for which we can not confirm the réservation. On may be emision by trayect but it's an increase of 39EUR per passenger.If you are agree please confirm today before 21h>"
"airtickets.com is absolutely horrendous. my dad used it to book a round trip to cyprus for me. the journey without connections takes less than 12hours but thanks to the ardous journey airtickets choose for me it took me well over 24 hours. I spent more time in the airports than on the plane. Now i am having great difficulty trying to change my return flight reservartion. The airline that i use for most of the journey Egyptair does not have offices in northern cyprus, the option to change me reservation is not loading on the website page and the contact number given for the website is not going through. i have been put on hold for over ten minutes now...this is one customer who will not use this site ever again."
"We booked a trip with Momondo for our son last year, Calgary to Penang. The price, connection time was excellent. No issues came up and perhaps that is why our experience was positive. We phoned Cathay Pacific directly to book the seats .Some airlines won't speak to you if you haven't booked directly with them, at least this was our experience with Iberia ( booked with Expedia). However, Iberia emailed us regarding an itinerary change. We just had to deal with the Expedia Call Centre in Cairo to reschedule the flight.The majority of the flights we take each year are booked directly with the airlines, but sometimes we find it necessary to use booking companies. It's not our first choice, but our experiences have always been great."
"NEVER USE TRAVELGENIO!They use the follwoing trick to get your money without service1. You book - put in your full details2. they put you on a payment website - you put in your payment details3. they let you know that the payment was unseccessful4. you do not hear from them anymore 5. The money (full ticket fare) is taken from your credit card6. They never send a conformation, no ticket - no answer to tel calls or emails7. You lost all your money without any service. STAY away!"
"I have booked the tickets through airtickets.com, then I had to cancel my reservation. I called on +44 (203) 432 8090 and made the cancellation. Lady form department of cancellations promised contact with me and confirm the operation asap. She didn't do it and I didn't get my money back.Later I found out that a lot of users of this site fell into a similar situation.Now I prefer to buy tickets in real agencies, even if it is on the 10-20 euro expensive.My advice - never use airtickets.com."
"I have used third party sites with no problem EXCEPT when I didn't check the details carefully. All flights, payments etc. were fine - but I urge you to check the connection times carefully as well as which Terminals the flights depart from. Almost got caught getting from the QF terminal in Dubai to the Emirates departure terminal which was a bus ride away."
"Travel Genio, is the worst travel agency ever..... dont ever book by travelgenio...I booked three tickets through travelgenio, for some circumstances i wanted to cancel the reservation and i asked for refund!! They told me they will charge me for 30euros for each ticket and i will get the refund in 15 days as maximum... Then i only got refund for two tickets... I tried to call to ask for the last ticket, but they never answer the phone, where an answering machine answers and keep you waiting for 10 or 15 minutes then disconnect, i had a phone bill of 100euro from this stupid answering machine (it is their way of earning money).... I tried by email, but they simply said that the refund is made!!! i told them i could get a bank statement and everything they ask, but they ignored my emails.....Anyways dont ever deal with them.."
"I fly frequently. I first research using http://matrix.itasoftware.com/ This site gives a detailed overview of availability and pricing but does not allow direct purchase of tickets. I then cross check any interesting possibilities with Skyscanner and follow the link to the cheapest booking site for the required fare.Once the booking is complete, I check the e ticket code with the airline concerned on their booking management page.I have not had issues with airtickets.com, apart from a rather too relaxed customer service ethos."
"In addition to the above. From following up the debit info on my credit card, I believe that Airtickets.com is a Greek company. Their business address is AIRTICKETS.GR118, ALEXANDROU PANAGOULI STR.,AGIA PARASKEVI, 15343 PREFECTURE OF ATTICATel: 210-6074000Fax: 210-6074150"
I then cross check any interesting possibilities with Skyscanner and follow the link to the cheapest booking site for the required fare.====================Doing that is a ticking timebomb. Skyscanner links to shonky companies such as Bravofly Edreams and Opodo where the 'cheapest' ticket often doesn't exist. Use matrix and skyscanner by all means as these are great search resources but when you have found a good routing/times purchase directly from the airline.
"What I should have said is that I follow the link to the cheapest REPUTABLE booking site. Airtickets.com are IATA accredited. My immediate action on booking with third party companies is to request the actual airline reservation code, not the company's own booking reference; if this has not already been provided. The only problem I have ever had in this area was a booking with the STA agencyWith regard to ""shonky,"" both Opodo and Edreams are part of the multi national ODIGEO group, domiciled in Barcelona. This is the 5th largest online travel ticketing company in the world and the largest in Europe, so perhaps this epithet is unwarranted. Bookings made with any of the UK arms of this company are subject to UK lawHowever, Bravofly, turns out to be an Italian outfit, but registered in the border town of Chiasso, just inside Switzerland and isues with this company are thus subject to Swiss law.Edited: 6 years ago "
"With regard to ""shonky,"" both Opodo and Edreams are part of the multi national ODIGEO group, domiciled in Barcelona. This is the 5th largest online travel ticketing company in the world and the largest in Europe, so perhaps this epithet is unwarranted. ===================So would you buy from Edreams Mr Metaxa, given the many many hundreds of posts on here detailing bait and switch, overcharging and other underhand tactics they employ. I would suggest the word shonky is underplaying it somewhat."
"With all of these types of companies you are entering into a higher than usual risk of you not getting what you paid for, or customer service not being what you expected if something needs to be changed.If saving some money is worth it to you to take on that risk, then go ahead, but do it with your eyes open, and please don't be surprised when the company turns out to be not what you expect.The reason we advise most people to book directly with the airlines is that while the prices may be higher, the risk involved with their trip not going as planned is significantly less, and there is recourse if things do go wrong."
"This is the 5th largest online travel ticketing company in the world and the largest in Europe, so perhaps this epithet is unwarranted. =======No, its very warranted."
"As a frequent flyer, I have used 3rd party bookers for many years and saved literally thousands of pounds. I will continue to do so. It all comes down to personal choice. I go in eyes and mind wide open and always pay with a credit card. I have used both E deams and Opodo, originally set up by a consortium of European airlines; on numerous occasions without issue.Airlines themselves are not always blameless. I have had on-line booking issues with Virgin Atlantic and also the perceived holy grail of airline efficiency, namely Emirates It would be interesting to know how many of the negative opinions on this thread are actually contributed by those who have had first hand negative experience with third party companies."
"<<I have used both E deams and Opodo, originally set up by a consortium of European airlines>>.... but no longer owned by them, so whats the relevance of that?<<Airlines themselves are not always blameless. I have had on-line booking issues with Virgin Atlantic and also the perceived holy grail of airline efficiency, namely Emirates >>How does adding another intermediary in the chain help that ?<<It would be interesting to know how many of the negative opinions on this thread are actually contributed by those who have had first hand negative experience with third party companies.>>In the thread on eDReams thats about 250 posts long, probably about 80-100 I would guess. In the thread on eDReams thats about 100 posts long, probably about 40-50 I would guess.That of course excludes the websites specifically set up to complain about them that gathers its own sets of negative comments.You say you've saved thousands, are you sure? I've seen people here *say* they were cheaper but whenever I've actually compared, they are maybe £10-£20 cheaper on a £500 fare. And that of course is the first fare. Not the one when they come back and say ""the price went up"".I suggest you go tell those who had some incredibly dismal experiences that they cannot have happened, and that your buying a flight without issue, means their experience was not true. How about the guy who was sold a flight that was only eligible for Israeli citizens (he was Swiss) and they refused to refund him. Or the folks sold two singles as a return, outward flight cancelled and refunded, told to go spin on the return which is obviously useless. Or selling a return as a single to make it cheaper, violating the airlines rules. I bet they weren't doing that when they were owned by airlines. Now, anything goes."
"""It all comes down to personal choice. I go in eyes and mind wide open and always pay with a credit card.""I totally agree with you. The problem is that a lot of folks don't go in with eyes open. They see lower prices, then close their eyes and push the ""Book now!"" button and get surprised when something goes wrong and the level of customer service doesn't match their expectations.Bottom line is - if you want to minimise the risk of something going wrong while maybe spending more (think of it like insurance) then go directly to the airlines and cut out the middle men. If you are willing to take on the risk for the sake of saving some money, then use companies like these, going in, as you say, with your eyes open."
">>As a frequent flyer, I have used 3rd party bookers for many years and saved literally thousands of pounds<<If that is true I will eat my own liver. It probably cost you that much, but you simply don't know it."
"I have been using Momondo regularly to search for cheap flights. I thought that all the sites Momondo directs you to were meant to be reliable (i.e. ""hand-picked"" by Momondo) but I have now been informed that Momondo is just a meta-search engine and it does not endorse any of the suppliers. In the past years, via Momondo, I have booked with the following 3rd party agents:AirTicketsDirect.comTravelPapa.comTripsta.ieExpedia.ieI have never had any problems with them. I paid online with my credit card and the tickets are issued ""immediately"" (usually within hours, at most within a day). This time, I had been directed to AirTickets.com and it's the first time that I have problems.My credit card was debited at the time that I made the booking (AirTickets.com claims to only deduct funds when tickets are issued) so I was led to believe that my tickets had already been issued. I waited a whole week but still no e-tickets had been emailed to me. I emailed them a few times but no replies. Since I am not in Europe (The company is based in Greece and has a +44 number only) it would be way too costly to call their ""customer service"" number (I was expecting looooong waits on the phone) so I tried to Skype-call them first. I tried 4 times. Each time was a 15 minute wait while you listen to their recording and a lady's voice telling you that all their lines are busy, then eventually it hangs up. When I finally got through, I was relieved to hear a human voice and I told the agent that I still had not received my ticket numbers and confirmation. After verifying the details he asked for my email address again and sent it to me right there and then. I was waiting on the line while he sends the email and I kept holding the call while I checked the reservation code on the Kenya Airways website to make sure it's legit before I'd let him go (I wasn't sure if I could get through if I called again). I was really, really worried after reading all the comments on their Facebook page. They all seem to be complaints. My e-tickets look alright now so fingers crossed that we will not experience any problems when we fly next month."
"Do not book through travelgenio or travel2be. Or at least hope everything goes well the first time. In my booking it didn't, which was my own mistake. Used the wrong name on a ticket. I wanted to inform whether changing it was an option. I sent an e-mail, nobody replied for 5 days, i sent another urging them to call me the same day as i was getting very worried it would all go wrong and one in our party wouldn't be able to fly 2 weeks later. Nobody replied for 2 days, then i called and the first person i spoke to started reading my e-mail for the first time. It took them almost another week to get an answer to my question. At last i was affraid everything would go wrong, couldn't wait anymore and booked a new ticket directly through the airline. The delay the company caused cost me a rise in ticketfare from 120 to 350 euro's. The old ticket was non-refundable. Bad, bad service reacting this slowly! unimaginable in today's travelindustry."
i`ve booked tickets to Vietnam via Netflights only £465- no problems no extras go tomorrow!!I was comcerned that i couldnt book seats on CP website so Netflights allocated us 3 and thankfully we checked in and have those seats.Edited: 6 years ago 
"DONT BOOK WITH THEM!I should fly this evening, called the fly agency to comfirm my ticket. ""im sorry your ticket has been cancelled because Travel GENIO didnt pay"". I had the prove that i did pay and had my e ticket ready. Called Travel Genio had to wait for minutes! After that they confirmd me that my ticket had been cancelled withoud telling me! At the end the woman did wish me a good after noon, did apolygize and told me i would get my money back in 30!!!!!!! days! So no ticket, no flight... Becarefull with this company, for me never ever again! Hoping to see my money! Google some more and you would see that its a fake company!"
"Hi I use sky scanner all the time and have never had any issues with them. Today I decided to use another flight search engine and was directed to airtickets.com to purchase my ticket. They were offering the exact flight I wanted that sky scanner kept saying was no longer available through the agencies signed up to skyscanner. so I thought I would give it a try, after all, my payment should be protected by VISA. With the transaction completed, I received confirmation details, receipt and e-ticket immediately. I then went to the BA airline website to see if my details were registered with them with the booking number I was given by airtickets.com. So went to ""manage my booking"" and all my personal details, flight information etc are there on the BA website. So I am glad to say, my experience has been a good one so farEdited: 6 years ago "
I tried and Failed to book tickets with aritickets.com - they are a disaster! NEVER USE THEM!! I booked paid for and received confirmation for flights from perth to Frankfurt to be emailed the next day being told that the airline failed to confirm and therefore the booking was cancelled! I called them up for help to confirm the booking pleading for them to sort it out and I was spoken to in a very cheeky manner by a lady in the call centre! I ended up fixing the issue myself after a few phone calls to the respective airlines (Garuda and Etihad) dealing with agents who were extremely helpful and went out of their way to sort it out for me! It was simple really all they would have had to do was put in a phone call to the airline themselves! RIDICULOUS that they are in operation!
"Horrible service. Booked a long-haul Lufthansa ticket on the morning of 10/12 which costs me more than £1000. Just to get told in the afternoon that they cannot secure a deal with the airline and the booking was cancelled. The real pain is that I couldn not get my money back even after more than 3 working days! Asked for their help to contact my bank in order to speed up the process so that I can access my money again, but they just won't do it.Horrible horrible customer service.Don't ever book through them.It will just cause you loose money rather than saving it!"
"This is the worst company i have ever encountered, I did my reservation with them in month of July 2013 with an insurance of cancellation. I cancelled my travel well before the flight time, my reimbursement was approved in month of August by an email & since then i've been waiting for it. But there is no response at all, they have stopped replying emails and when called client service they transfer the call from one operator to another & cut in the end after a long delay."
I always wonder why people book with 3rd party online sites;-)
"<I always wonder why people book with 3rd party online sites;-)>Cheers! I always wonder why people don't come to TripAdvisor FIRST to do reasearch before booking, but rather use TA as a complaint forum after they've ""been wronged""."
"Disaster: I'm really disappointed and angry! I booked a flight from Bali to Germany with the insurance plus! The insurance plus is promising 85% directly back, if I have to cancel the flight. I just have to send a mail to the special canceling address without any reasons and they will transfer the money back. That's what is standing on their website!But not at all!First at all, they didn't reply to one of my three emails, so I needed to organize a Skype call. It felt it took hours till they answered the call. Jesus Christ. The lady said, she got the emails, but I should know, that they will transfer the money earliest back after a minimum of 30 days. She knows she said, there are a lot things standing not clear enough on their website and hips of people complained, but there is no reaction from the side of the management! Now i have no money to book another flight home! It's horrible! This company need to be forbidden! That's ripp-off, a fraud! Don't book over travelgenio, they will not change anything, till they feel a consequence! I need a lawyer!"

"Tried to book tickets with airtickets.com. After entering passenger details, got message ""price was changed"", and the new offered price is significantly higher.. It happens all the times. Do not waste your time!"
airtickets is a legitimate website/company. I book most of my flights from them the last 5 yrs and never had a problem.
"Are you sure about that? it is supposedly managed by Airtickets Travel Services Ltd but cannot find any company of that name registered at Companies House, also hotels page is a screenscrape of booking.com website with the airtickets.com logo pasted on it First time post-smell a troll"
I reserved 2 flights from the US to Germany for this summer and confirmed with Amex but after the booking was completed I got an email telling me to use a shady online banking portal to pay for the tickets. They gave no explanation as to why this was necessary. I told them that we would only be willing to pay via amex but they kept requesting this online portal. Long story but in the end I attacked them via Facebook and via email with threats of legal action and fraud investigation. They took down every Facebook posting almost immediately. In the end it worked and they canceled the booking reservation without fees. Terrible experience. We alerted amex's fraud dept and hope that nothing shows up. Never again !!!!!!!!! Next time I will pay more attention to looking into the company before I try to book a cheap flight.
"I will never ever buy tickets from Travelgenio anymore. We booked ticketes and were waiting for a electronic tickets, but they didn't come, after a week of waiting I call to a travelgenio infolinoline to ask what happened with my ticket. The operators hang the phone three times till I finaly had a good luck and somebody helpful answered and sent me a ticket. Unfortunately this is not the end of the story. We bought a direct flight from Mexico City to Munich. On the ticket there was written no stop on the way, when we booked a flight, there was nothing written about any stop, the plane make between Mexico and Munich. When I came to the airport to take a plane from Mexico to Europe I was told that the plane makes stop in Atlanta and I need a visa. I didn't have any so I lost the plane. It cost a lot of money to get to rebook my ticket I nevergot back from the ticket seller.But this is not the end of the story neither. Unfortunately the same happened to my wife, she found out two weeks before her flight, so she had enough time to resolve the situation. She spent 3 days calling to Travelgenio, operators were keeping hanging up the phone. Finaly after three days they changed the flight via Europe, haleluya, and asked for 80EUR for the service! For their most sh..ty service ever they dare to ask extra 80EUR. I can't believe it...."
"I also found the best tickets in airticket.com. however i've been trying since yesterday to book one of three different tickets, and their website does seem to work properly.their phone support by the way, is very unfriendly.Good luck"
"airtickets.com seem to be in the habit of giving you the incorrect booking reference number for the airline in order for you to be able to check in.I booked with them a few days ago, decided to double-check what was supposedly the Etihad booking reference on the Etihad website, and it was incorrect. Due to earlier posts about how rubbish the customer service at airtickets.com is, I called Etihad directly using the e-ticket number and they were able to immediately give me the correct booking reference.The lady at Etihad also informed me that after flying one leg of the flight, you can modify your booking directly through them and don't have to deal with the third-party. Handy if you need to change your return date.Would (maybe) use again due to the ludicrous amount of money saved vs. the Etihad website (I have a lengthy stop over, which I am ok with). If you are going to use them I would make sure that you double check everything well before you are due to fly, and try contact the airline directly, rather than them, if there are any issues."
www.airtickets.comAvoid! Extremely hard to understand staff on their UK landline. When I cancelled my ticket I received an email stating the refund would take 30-50 days. Outrageous! It's been 45 days now and still waiting. Over £1000 sat in somebody else's account. Would never use nor recommend these to anybody. Absolutely disgusted with their service.

"Welcome to the forums ZiaRuma. Maybe you'd like to share your experience, as ironically your post doesn't seem to contain much information.Also I have a feeling that your post will be deleted shortly due to some unnecessary language."
"Contrary to the general belief, I booked and flew on my trip without a problem. I booked through Airtkt.com Can try it. It may take some time to finally get the ticket for the exact time/date but if not try their help line 24/7 (1-800-247-4775)."
My opinion on booking with any 3rd party agent who promises the lowest fare: Don't. Book Direct.
"UPDATE - An update to my previous post (copied below), I eventually received my refund after several more emails requesting the payment. Guess what? It was refunded on the 50th day, clearly hanging onto over £1000 of my money for as long as possible, for a tiny amount of interest! Disgusting behaviour. I don't doubt they may find cheap flights, but the returns process is an absolute shambles. I say again, AVOID!www.airtickets.comAvoid! Extremely hard to understand staff on their UK landline.When I cancelled my ticket I received an email stating the refund would take 30-50 days. Outrageous! It's been 45 days now and still waiting.

"This company, airtickets.com, helped to fraud our credit card even after I'd emailed them to tell them the prauthorization they'd put through was wrong. They told me the name of the man in Kansas who was trying to buy tickets on our card, asked if I was him and when I said definitely not, they waited until the preauth dropped off, added more charges, and put it through. They didn't listen to me at all when I told them it wasn't us and even though giving us his name did help to give me something to take to the authorities, it was still highly unhelpful of them to put the charge through after I'd told them what was going on and they'd spoken to me about it and all. Do not use them."
"<<It was refunded on the 50th day, clearly hanging onto over £1000 of my money for as long as possible, for a tiny amount of interest!>>Well, besides any interest, there might have been other benefits for them, such as upgrading a COH (Cash On Hand) statement with Moody's, or another rating agency. It could also have figured into an agent's bonus. Lot's of other ""uses,"" beyond simple interest, and you will likely never know.Good news - you DID get it back, even if on the last day of the promise.Hunt"
"NEVER EVER BOOK WITH AIRTICKETS.. the company is an absolute joke and I have never experienced such bad customer service... booked my ticket together with a friend, I got one and she did not.. the company did however take the money from her account and then proceeded to take over 10 days to pay her back the money! I was told that it would be no problem to refund my ticket since the mistake was theirs, but they are now saying its impossible!"
"Travelgenio NEVER!1- Booked the flight got an email saying all was ok.2- Next day, got an email saying it hadn't been possible to charge my credit card, and sent me a link to make payment.3- Link looked really suspicious, so I didn't give any details.4- I Called my bank and they told me no atempt had been made to charge the price for the tickets.5- Realized they had charged me 74€, that I never authorized.6- Sent them a mail threatening to file complaint both with bank and police authorities.7- Got an email from them,never offered an explanation, simply stating they were refunding the money, and eventually they did.I believe they're business has nothing to do with selling air tickets.After seeing so many people who describe the same experience on line and some even worse, I fail to understand how Skyscanner, keeps them on their search engine!"
We just got back from our trip in Kauai and I used the airticketsdirect.com website for booking the air tickets with alaska airlines. No problem at all! Airticketsdirect generated the e-tickets minutes after I booked the flights to Kauai. I would use them again for our next flights :) Definitely 5 stars!
That's a lovely story but Air Tickets Direct is not the same company as airtickets.com !!!
I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to book tickets on airtickets.com. They are the worst company to deal with. They never answer their phones nor do they phone you back if you ask them too. The tickets seems cheap but they charge you heavily on rebooking or you hardly get anything back if you need to cancel your ticket. I have made this mistake to book with them and this will be my last time. Never again!!! Go directly with the airline even if you do pay a little more.
"I do not know the website and agree that it is better to book always directly with the airline. However even if you book directly with the airline cancellation and change of booking fees depend on your ticket and T&C's. If you buy a non refundable ticket directly from the airline and cancel it subsequently, you will get in most cases nothing as it is non-refundable.Edited: 6 years ago "
"NEVER USE THIS SITE EVER! http://www.airtickets.com/It is a fraud!I was searching for a flight to Sweden on momondo.com then found a ticket of 348 EUR, I was directed to book it on airtickets.com, I booked the ticket (My Reservation Number airtickets.com: SSN2K0 ) and my Credit Card was charged by 355.98 EUR immediately.I have tried to check in with reservation number they sent to me via email but it did not work, I cannot find any record of them, I have tried calling and sending emails but I have no response, I have tried to call customer service number repetitively for over an hour but in vain.Later I found out that many users of this site fell into a similar situationExtremely worried that I have been ripped offI had to cancel it after finding that airticket.com is a fraud, but I did not get a refund of my moneyThis company is a fraud and the staff are the useless bunch of incompetent, rude, arrogant liars I have ever come acrossHow can I report this company for the police Internet Section?"
Finally some one who actually has common sense and knows what they talking about!
"I also had a TERRIBLE experience with them... NEVER use them, they are really crap. Hang on the phone when you contact them, do not reply to emails..."
"I haven't bothered to read through all of the comments. These seem to be from rich people, or people employed with major airlines. I have never used the Travelgenio specifically, but ALWAYS book on a 3rd party site. The airlines themselves are asking 2-4k per ticket, which I can get for around 1k through a 3rd party site. Until I'm made of money, I'll keep using them. Some of the responses were just a bunch of arrogant creeps. Like telling you, who posted to ask (because you're not stupid enough to assume that sites on a reputable search engine - supposedly - are reputable) that sites on a reputable search engine are not reputable. Thanks for reminding me of the control issues and ego issues too many people suffer from. Matej, I was seeking the same info, btw, specifically regarding Travelgenio. The responses to your question are basically useless."
"Hi, I booked my ticket from Christchurch New Zealand to healthrow last week through skyscanner and got diverted to airticket24.com. After I click pay, there is this tick that I should receive a receipt and my itinerary by email. 3 days later have recieve my credit card had been charge and until to this very moment I don't have any email or confirmation of some sort. I got a very funny feeling,....right now I am thinking if I don't hear anything I'll call my bank and ask their help. Please anyone can give me any practical solution. Cheers"
I'd suggest calling your bank ASAP to check to see if a payment has been processed as it's been 3 days since you have said you booked - your bank should be able to see a transaction by now.
"More than very close to cheating!I was checking flights between Tenerife and Malaga at Opedo, but I never pushed the “commit” button.There was too much additionals and complex, so I decided to buy directly from the airline company (Vueling).Next day I received an e-mail from Travel-Genio, where I was asked to complete my bookings ""“Click here to complete the previous booking. [Finish your reservation]”. I found this strange, since I felt I had completed the day before.But I was in a hurry, and followed the instructions. I later realized I had now bought the same tickets as I had previously bought with Vueling. Travelgenio showed no interest in cancelling my double buying.It must be Travelgenio's use of tracking cookies that has made it possible for them to track up my e-mail address, and mislead me to think my booking was not completed.This is dirty tricks, and I will warn everybody else: Avoid Travelgenio/Opedo."
"I used travelgenio.com to buy tickets to Sardinia. They were air italia tickets and were much cheaper through Travelgenio. I was worried the night before we flew as I couldn't book in online. In fact the message said that the ticket and booking number were not valid. I emailed travelgenio that night with my concern but I've not had a response. HOWEVER, the flights worked, we could book in at the airport, so I'd use them again."
"DONT do it!!!I'm currently stuck in Japan with no resolution. Airtickets.com has incorrectly stated my name twice on my ticket. I waited a week for them to get around it change my name the day of my flight. They charged me $50, I lost my seat assignment and food preference. After that, my name is wrong again! The agents are rude and frankly, poor English speakers at best. I was assured this would be fixed the day I booked. They were never going to change the reservation. Major credit card companies should revoke their charging privileges, this is not a legitimate agency."
agree. airtickets.com are awful. their site is a scam and i would hope momondo and other travel search sites would remove their results. I got ripped off for US$600!!I have filed a complaint with FTC essentially banning their access to the US market.
"Fellow travellers - do not to book with TravelGenio! I wanted to book flights through TravelGenio in April. The transaction was completed successfully as indicated on the site and I was told that I would receive a confirmation within 48 hours. Instead I received a very strange email indicating that due to ""the nature of my trip"" (which was an Easter vacation) I would not be allowed to pay by credit card and I was sent a link where I would need to input my bank account information to make a wire transfer for the payment. However, by this point I had already been charged the full amount of the flights on my credit card. I called their customer service line and was told that I would not be allowed to pay by credit card as TravelGenio requires payment through wire transfer unless you have a European account (I used a Visa credit card issued in Canada) and that they charged my credit card by mistake. The amount would be refunded on my account promptly and I would need to complete the wire transfer to purchase the flights. By this point I was too frustrated with the company to continue with the transaction or provide my bank wire information and decided to just receive my refund and cancel the order. When I received the refund however, I was out by about $40 CAD due to the difference in exchange rates over the days when the amount was mistakenly charged by TravelGenio on my card and when it was finally refunded. I proceeded to contact TravelGenio with my concerns, stating that I had essentially lost $40CAD due to a mistake made on their part. They should never have charged my card in the first place, since allegedly they cannot take a credit card payment on non European cards. After a string of 19 emails back and forth with TravelGenio customer service agents, where I was told I would be receiving a refund if I sent them my bank information (which I provided). However, I was finally told in the last email that they had once again reviewed my situation and had decided that they could not provide me any compensation as the difference is due to the bank foreign exchange rates and outside of their control. I find this completely unacceptable. The mistake was made by TravelGenio charging my credit card erroneously and the delay in refunding me the balance. Additionally, no where on their site could I find any information indicating that payment cannot be made by standard credit cards like Visa. Even if I had gone through with the flight booking, I would have still lost the $40 CAD by them charging and refunding the amounts on the credit card, which after further online research, I have found is standard practice for the company. Lastly, I can't believe that they made me correspond with them for weeks, over 19 emails, and send them my RIB/IBAN bank information which they now have at their disposal and still refused to compensate me in any way. Save yourself the hassle and book with someone else - unbelievable!"
"My experience with airtickets.com has been nothing but horrendous.I booked a ticket from Johannesburg to Bangkok which was an ok price and routing etc.My circumstances changed and I had to change the booking to a Johannesburg to Oslo flight.I wasn't cancelling the flight, I was changing the flight which was a more expensive flight anyway!!I was lied to, ignored, and treated like scum.My emails were ignored time and time again. I rang Etihad Airways and they advised they had no control over the situation as it was booked through a third party.I rang airtickets.com and was told the booking section was busy and I would get a call back. No call back, just a blatant fob off and lie.Disgraceful treatment from airtickets.com. DO NOT USE THEM!!!I am appalled at their unprofessional behaviour and lies.I would rather pay more for a ticket than ever use airtickets.com again.BUYER BEWARE!!!! DONT USE THEM THEY ARE A MISCHEVIOUS BACKYARD OPERATION."
And another thing in regards to my booking with airtickets.com.....I asked them for the Etihad airlines booking reference as they only gave me their ref number.They sent me ANOTHER PERSONS NAME AND BOOKING REFERENCE NUMBER!!!!!I could have accessed ANOTHER PERSONS BOOKING because these backyard idiots sent me the wrong details.Can you believe it!!!!??? If you use skyscanner for flight searches and one of the options comes up as AIRTICKETS.COM.........DONT USE THEM UNLESS YOU WANT FRUSTRATING ISSUES DOWN THE TRACK.
"^^^ There is no need to keep shouting in your posts. We get the message, just a shame you didn't before doing business with them."
"Do not book through Airtickets.com.While the booking is simple through their website I am now wasting time and money to get the reservation changed. Called 5 times from my end and had my (more patient wife) call them two more times. Always the promise to call back as their lines to the 'change department' are busy. Never been called back, though.I might just cancel the entire ticket and absorb the losses than hanging in there without confirmation that the flight was changed.These guys are not professional!"
"thank you all, read all your messages will now go and pay a little more booking with known provider. Why ruin holiday for 50.00"
"I just used airtickets.com to buy tickets to Greece after I was linked there by skyscanner.com. These tickets were$250 cheaper per person than any other travel site. After reading reviews, I was pretty nervous, but I concluded it was a legitimate site that had customer service issues. I purchased my tickets, and I have now confirmed with the two carriers, Air Canada and Lufthansa, that I am in fact booked on those flights. Bottom line is that it worked for me. It seems strange to me that all these people have name changing ticket issues. I imagine Airtickets.com just takes the names you typed in and puts that name on the ticket. I wonder if some people just entered the incorrect information when filling out the page online. I would just suggest that people be careful filling out their information on the site.I can't speak for their customer service, but I can say that I purchased tickets via airtickets.com and am now on the flights. Given that I am over 2 months out from my trip, I figured I could deal with a bad customer service department if necessary and it was worth it to save $500 altogether on flights."
"I imagine Airtickets.com just takes the names you typed in and puts that name on the ticket.========If they are like many others, the way they do that can be very low tech, literally retyping it, not some snazzy super duper direct connection to the airlines computer system.Or if not retyped, by a low tech kludgy technique called ""screen scraping"" which is subject to errors and bugs because the airline only needs make a small inconspicuous change to their website to mess up the seamless transmission of information.In either case, what you type in at one end doesn't necessarily come out the same at the airlines end.Edited: 6 years ago "
"i booked Vietnam last november via Kayak and using Netflights (who had a sale) everything went smoothly, flying with Cathay Pacific and we saved quite a lot (tickets were less than £540) compared to their own website. So i do not agree that you should avoid them. Just do your research first and use the reputable ones."
oh and i had a booking number and went straight on to cathay pacific and my booking was there with them.
"Niki, posting your booking number on an open Internet forum is idiotic. I use the word carefully. With a little search someone could get into your booking and cancel it in a couple of clicks. What are you thinking? Delete your post."

"If you book a ""budget"" ticket and your circumstances change, and you have to pay for it - WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING? You get what you pay for! You cannot blame the travel company! Are you kidding meCan we have an unbias opinion of using one of the budget sites and not changing your ticket? How did your experience go? I don't want to read bias reviews from people who feel like they can shop at McDonalds and are entitled to Prime Steakhouse customer service. Unbelievable"
"I have not done business with Airtickets. But today a company called ""Airtickets', giving the phone contact number of the Airtickets.Co.Uk site, tried to charge GBP 640.50 to my credit card. The credit card company (Halifax) was suspicious and blocked this, then called me. This was a definite fraud attempt by somebody, and has been reported to the police."
"I'd guess that odds are that the fraud originates outside airtickets, eg someone else was using your card number to try to buy a ticket via AIrtickets. I had a fraudulent charge on my Amex from Easyjet a couple of weeks ago, and maybe 5 years ago Iberia. So using credit cards to buy plane tickets is obviously a common fraud.Do I take it your card is being replaced? Amex cancelled my card immediately (and before that I think it was MasterCard, did the same)"
"NEVER use travelgenio !We booked tickets from Beijing to Bangkok. Two days before we left they send us a n email telling they booked us on another flight one day later. I sent an email back saying I will take the flight bu I thought it was mot correct of them to do this.When we got in the airport, we couldn t check in. They said travelgenio cancelled our tickets. so we could not leave. Travelgenio didn t let us know anything.I went through a lot of money to get my money back. When I asked why they cancelled it they said I asked them to."
"I read through all the posts in this thread, and I so want to avoid them at all cost. However the payment page of China Eastern turns out to be a mess and due to the long-wait page load, I was not not able to finish the transaction with them (the airliner).So as my friend booked through the agent and got his ticket issued almost immediately (can be checked and is valid on the airline website), I decided to give it (travel2be - turns out to be travelgenio actually) a try. Too bad, a day later they sent me an email, saying that they got trouble completing the transaction with my bank (my bank concluded that this transaction is suspicious and refused the debit from them, of course my balance is surely enough - thanks BNP). Then they introduced me a link, which lead to a ""secured payment platform by us"", and urged me to pay through that payment quickly.The ""secured platform"", although starts with https://, looks so suspicious, and miserable. Besides, all the information insides is get from the URL, which means I myself can create any payment page with random amount just by playing with the URL. At this point I stopped, and inform them, since the transaction is not effective, I cancel my reservation.They said OK, and the next day, an amount of 17.4 EUR appeared on my bill as ""agent fee"", even though no ticket whatsoever was issued. (17.4 EUR - I was lucky because I filled in the code promotion, otherwise it'll be 62 EUR).I wrote an email to them, saying that this charge is in dispute. If this is not resolved between me and them, I'll file the report to my bank, card provider company and even police.Well, I got problem with them just right from the stage of booking. The amount lost is not so much, however it still cause the feeling of being cheated. So guys, these kind of company should not have reasons to exist. Even if you get away without problems, you little discount is compensated by the money it rob from the others.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I booked my flight through airtickets.com...the ticket itself was ok, quite cheap, but the problem with these guys is the customer service. 3 weeks before the return trip they informed me via email that they changed my flight because of some issues with the stops. Well..I just said that it wouldn't be a problem if they could confirm the sits I booked on the previous flight. Since then it's been a nightmare. I sent many emails (never responded to me), made many calls and I always got the same answer: ""we'll give you a response in the very next day"". Lies. I moved on and booked a new ticket with a different company. My opinion is: disgraceful, hopeless and poor customer service. So if you book a ticket through them, pray that you're not gonna have any issue, otherwise you're in a lot of troubles.LucaEdited: 6 years ago "
"I tried to book flights though airtickets last night and got all the way to the finish line and then the website informed me that them flights weren't available so to try different dates.. I then looked in my bank account and they have taken the $5044.05 for the flights but didn't give me tickets. I've been contacting them all day (their customer service is horrible) and they are saying the money went back in immediately after the transaction failed but it hasn't and now they are trying to say it's the banks fault/problem so ""they"" don't want a bar of me. So never book with these guys as I'm still trying to get my money back and it's hard to contact your banks and them when you are overseas.. You make think you're saving money but in the long run you are out of pocket all your money . I hate airtickets!!!"
Have they made a 'reservation' on your credit card?
Any news? Are you thinking of taking any legal action against them?I'm still fighting my battle to get a refund...Edited: 6 years ago 
"Travel2be must be avoided. Just spent hours attempting to book, there site Is terrible. Many errors and then you get the email saying you have not completed offering you further discounts. I gave up after 2 days and more than three hours. Booked direct with airline found it was about 20% cheaper and no hassle. Travel 2be is either a giant scam or the most in competent travel site around. Watch your Credit Card account after dealing with them. DS, nz. 23 july2014."
Never ever use this site. They are thiefs.
"TravelGenio is a scam. I bought several flghts while in China. That went OK. I needed to cancel a flight and that went also OK, they promised me a % refund. Then the emailing stopped. I never heard back from them and they did not replied on my many emails anymore. Money was gone. They are just criminals."
"NEVER use travelgenio. I recently booked a return air flight. I was unable to make the first flight however got to my destination the next day on a different flight (not booked through Travelgenio). I then found out that because I didn't make the first leg of the return trip, travelgenio cancelled my return leg. Despite paying for it and being issued a seat, I turned up at the airport only to be advised that my travel agent (Travelgenio) cancelled my return flight. I then had to pay again to fly home.NEVER USE TRAVELGENIO"
"Totally agree. I booked a return flight thru them, couldn't make the first leg so they cancelled my return leg! Only found this out when I went to the airport to fly home. Agree, criminals"
"Richard L, I'm not a supporter of buying through travelgenio, and I'd always tell you to buy direct from the airline.But in this case even if you had done this, it's the airline that will have cancelled the return flight because you failed to turn up for the outward. This is absolutely standard worldwide, airline computers do it automatically, nothing to do with the travel agents at all."
"Thanks Andy. Doesn't seem just. I guess my anger is misdirected toward Travelgenio. Next time I will book two separate legs rather than a return trip on ten same booking. That way if I can't make the first leg, they can't cancel the return leg.Cheers"
"Why not book a return ticket that's changeable? They are more expensive, but maybe not as much as throwing away the cost of a on-way ticket. This is what business travellers often do. But be careful, there are different sorts of changeable tickets, sometimes there's a change fee, and often you have to pay the difference (if any) between the fare you've already paid and the fare for the new flight you want to take. Worth looking into before making a final decision."
"I've used ctrip.com twice before (which is also featured on skyscanner and may just be more common for flights in and out of China??) but I found with both experiences our flight was altered somewhat. Neither time was drastic, maybe to a flight time that's an hour later, but sometimes when you book a flight time you don't have that flexibility. I thought it was strange for the two times I used ctrip (which offered slightly lower fares), the flights were effected and they're never effected when I use expedia. So I don't know if you're last in the que of importance and get bumped easily? Would be strange if it was just a coincidence."
do not trust Travelgenio!!!We booked a flight from Cancun to Havana with travelgenio. When we arrived at the airport our tickets were canceled. There was a reservation in our names but it had been canceled the same day. We had to pay in cash to the airline company if we wanted to take that plane. We called travelgenio in Cancun but we were put on hold for more than 10 minutes ... there was no respons so we decided to hang up and we payed in cash.Still trying to get a refund. It has been more than a month. no respons on email and long waiting before answer on the phone
"http://www.airtickets.com/ i have bought a package from them, and once i went to air port , the air line deny to have me on board because they have not done their list from http://www.airtickets.com/ office, i have asked for refund and anfter lot's of emails and discation they are delaying to pay, it is almost 4 month now, and i am perty sure they have no intention on paying beck the refund amount.they are fake, and lier, they hide their face under british nationality, i found out the owner are indian or pakistani, and every time you call them the staff they answer they have weird accent. have no idea even if the operator are located in UK or the call center is some where in india. any way i have shared my history to alet new victim.Please be careful about his company and website.never deal with them, as they sound so scammer or fault service provider.thanks for reading."
"Have been trying to book a flight on Travelgenio - but it keeps coming up with the message 'booking has not been guaranted because the flight is no longer available'. You can then still proceed with payment but not over a secure connection!! 2,3,4 days later the flight is still on the web for sale with the same Travelgenio - I have to ask if this is some sort of scam."
"I actively advise against doing business with travel genio--I had a nightmare of a time booking tickets with them (emotionally, economically), it took five days and an additional $600 beyond the original ticket price. See additional complaints:https:/…www.travelgenio.com"
"They have been horrid to deal with ... we had a ticket suspended because while away on holidays visiting my aunt, she fell ill, was hospitalised, and died. Getting the ticket suspended was a nightmare and only happened because a lovely girl at Virgin took pity on me .... getting it reinstated so I could take the ashes back has been even worse ... it looks like I am going to have to pay for a ticket because I just can't get a response from them. NOT recommended!"
"Guys,I had booked a flight from Auckland (New Zealand) to Perth (Australia) on the 10th July 2014. I was travelling on the 31st September 2014. I've gone to the airport to check in and I've been told that I don't have a ticket. I booked using skyscanner and it directed me to travel2be.com. I thought I'd paid AUD$540.76 (there is a receipt in my emails). However, my credit card has not been charged. I've been told that it would occur over the comming weeks by travel2be.com and not to worry about it. I've stupidly relied on them and had to pay NZD$899 for a ticket at the airport. Please be careful using these sites. Air New Zealand have placed this website on their suspicious internet travel agent list."

"Hi,All the negativity to me does not seem in place. My experience have not been bad at all; always used skyscanner and have hence had my flights been ticketed by travelgenio, tripair, opodo, bravofly, gate1, tix, ...If you do not amend your flights - which most of the time you can't anyways in the lowest fare brackets - I think you're more than safe.The only thing I was triggered with recently: if the 'middle man' goes bust, is your flight stil guaranteed? There are all kinds of measures in place for airlines that fall over, but I couldnt find this for online travel agents. Are you protected via your credit card? Anyone good insights?Travelgenio / Travel2be has grown to an operating income of 180 million EUR, so not a small puppy anymore. Still, I think the business is not an easy one to keep your head afloat."

"so after the whole of this thread being read, your still not going to book direct with airline"
"Travelgenio is a fraud company. Booked a ticket from Barcelona to Norway after using a link on Skyscanner. I bought the ticket last Friday at 01 PM and got a confirmation e-mail right after saying ticket would come over e-mail, checked my e-mail several times afterwards on Friday but nothing. Next morning at 0700 I saw an e-mail from late evening the day before, stating due to travelling from a high-risk airport I had to pay with another e-mail link for Secure Transfer. I did so right away and received another e-mail saying my e-tickets would be issued shortly. Nothing happened and on my way to the airport I found the customer service, who barely spoke english, and after 30 min on the phone it turned out they had to send me another link to payment, as the ticket had become 50 Euro more expensive as I didn't pay directly after they send me the e-mail late Friday night. Get real!!! I told them to cancel my ticket and rather bought a 1000 Eur ticket directly from Air-France at the airport. I NEVER write customer reviews, but this time I think people should be warned. Do not even think about using travelgenio. Skyscanner is a good page, but if they want to become a serious player they must dump linking fraud companies like travelgenio, or else people with stop using their service in notime."

"Hi, I have just had exactly the same experience - arrived at the airport to be told that they had asked for a refund. I was unable to speak to them about it before my flight (for a connecting flight) left and I couldn't travel home as planned - and had to buy another flight. Can you please tell me how you went about claiming? Any advice at all would be great. So yeah, another - DO NOT USE TRAVELGENIO from me."
Does anyone know how/where to go about getting a refund from travelgenio? I arrived at the airport to take my return flight (I took the first one no problem) and was told that it was refunded already to travelgenio - I didn't do this! Would very much appreciate any help in what to do - I had to buy the flight again which cost 2000 Euos!!
"Terrible about refunds: I have been waiting for 3 months after a booking I made with Travelgenio was changed by the airline, Air Baltic. Travelgenio claim they have to wait for the airline to refund them before they can refund me - a load of nonsense! No-one else makes such a claim."

"""Travelgenio claim they have to wait for the airline to refund them before they can refund me - a load of nonsense!

There are 123 posts before yours warning people off them, so why you didn't check that before booking, .... oh well. Next time book directly with the airline, and then any refund, schedule change, and so on and so on, will be handled directly with the airline and not through some strange booker."
"Don't use them! Unacceptable. Two weeks after booking my tickets, I received an email with not only a change of time for my flight (that happens), but a change of date (2 days earlier)!!!I have tickets for a charity event that night, flights are full now (I could book directly through airlines, but it's 500€+ now); I am told it's that flight only or a refund! The AF outbound is operated by Delta but the equipment is some no name airline and travelgenio say they can only book alternatives with this no name (although they're not the operators). Makes no sense.Plus, I had to phone them 3 times to try and 'resolve' this, which didn't get resolved. I'm screwed, I cannot afford to book brand new tickets at the holidays now with less than 3 weeks before travel and I have to get to my destination for a visa appt with an embassy that cannot be missed. They refuse to allow me to speak to a supervisor or contact the airlines to find a solution. One man was ok and another was horrible at customer service, Joao.I will never use Travelgenio again and I suggest you never do either."
"flights are full now (I could book directly through airlines, but it's 500€+ now)=====So are they full, or 500€? There is a difference."
">>>I will never use Travelgenio again and I suggest you never do either.<<<You need to add the other dodgy third party sites to your warning. They are all pretty similar. Always book through the airlines. Third parties are hardly ever cheaper, despite what they claim."
"Travelgenio is not communicating. I ve sent them an email in July and now in November they answered me, but unfortunately not an answer on my question. So maybe next year i will get an answer again ..."
"No, don't book via travelgenio.You see a good Price and after you have finished the booking you have to pay a ""creditcard fee"" which is very high.But not anounced before.Very unserios."
"Airtickets.com had good offers... ***BUT!***Customer Service was about as bad as it can get. Very unfriendly and unapologetic when there were issues with the booking, that were caused by the customer and the booking agency. I asked to speak with the manager or a different agent but to no avail. In fact, there was only one agent. It cost me about 2 hours of my time and sweat to solve issues that were at least in part caused by airtickets.com. Next time, I will rather pay a few $$ more in the hope customer service would actually exist.THE BOTTOM LINE: I highly discourage booking through airtickets.com and will not recommend this to friends or other fellow travelers."
Do Not Use Airtickets.com!!!Simple story: I booked a flight through them. The flight was cancelled. This was in August and I am still fighting to get a refund. They just play games and hope that you lose your patience and give up on trying to get a refund...
Thanks for the advice. The sad story is that there are so many people out there who book and pay with them first and only once something goes wrong start to read/research on the internet. You are the living proof.
"They are real scam artists, DO NOT use airtickets.com they often charge higher prices than going direct to the airlines or expedia. Then the add a credit card usage fee on top. For instance a flight on jetstar in vietnam is half of what airtickets.com will charge and they will not match the price."
"Travelgenio is a perfectly reasonable agency. Using Momondo as the (excellent, very friendly) Search site, I have just booked over $8,000 of domestic airfares for my family's internal Australia travel for a saving of about $1000 less than booking direct with the airlines. No fuss, no bother, quick, polite responses - in English even tho based in Madrid. What's the problem?"
TRAVELGENIO = SCAMWarning this company is absolutly not truthful.
"Dont book through TravelGenio.I did. the airline cancelled the flight and put me on another flight quite a few hrs from my desired travel time.Normally the airline would then send an email to say you have an option- refund or anothe time.Travelgenio just gives another time. No way to change it.the time is not suitable for me and I am now driving to my deistination.I have called the airline to get the refund- they cannot do it, it must be done through travelgenio.I have emaiuled them 5 times, rung (placed in a que), sent a message through their website- still no respons e and no refund and Im booked in a flight I cant get to,Not really acceptable."

"Stay away from Airtickets.com. If you do decide to go with them , make sure you are aware of the hidden charges. I recently booked a ticket with them ( suggested by Momondo) and ended up paying an extra $70 on top of the total price of $1240. These charges were labeled as Credit Card Fee ,Administrative Fee , Airline Fee , etc. When contacted , I was told that I was informed about extra charges right before I clicked to finalize the transaction. Well I did not notice any such information but assuming that the CSR is telling the truth , these notifications are purposely designed to stay obscure. Had I known about these hidden charges , I would have taken an entirely different and probably more convenient route as far as my itinerary was concerned.Stay away from these people."
"Found them through Momondo.Booked a flight for me and my boyfriend, needed to change the date and time. Customer service said they will get back to me but hastily assured me, before hanging up, that the penalty will be £160 for both (I know - exorbitant!). I asked him to call me back to confirm the total price, because I want to re-book on the same price. One hour later he called my unsuspecting boyfriend (he had the phone number for both of us), and billed him on the spot for £200, saying that I had agreed to it. £40 is not much in the scheme of things but this is just sloppy, extremely unprofessional, and I even suspect deliberate. When asked for clarification, all they can say is 'that's how it is'. Absolutely not transparent, you don't know where the money goes, and the charges keep piling up.And all these time I'm wondering why oh why did I not book my tickets straight with Emirates? I'm sorry to say this, considering there are people out there who depend on this industry - but the reason middlemen exist is to offer added value (service, convenience) for customers, not to rip them off and make an extra buck here and there.If the latter is the case, then the whole travel agent thing can, and should just disappear altogether. This is the first, and last time I book with online agents."
"I booked with airtickets.com and after reading all the negative reveiew I was sure I was in trouble. Anyway I flew Orlando to Toronto, via Chicago O'Hare yesterday (Dec 10, 2014) and had no problems whatever. In fact I called their phone number and it was answered immediately although I was a bit nervous as it was obviously in Greece, or Russia. The ticket was made out using my first name with MR directly attached, I was sure it would be a problem so called the airline and they said it was fine, and I checked in On-Line. Just wanted to put airtickets.com in perspective, they are not a scam, in fact I ended up with a considerably cheap flight in comparison to lots of other sellers."
"very bad experience with Travelgenio.... I had to cancel my trip and it is already 7 months that Travelgenio has not been able to reimburse to me the ticket cost. I have canceled as per their rules with few month in advance notice. I am calling and writing few times a week ever then. They do not respond to the written messages and when I call they give a very vague answers. Not possible to talk to supervisor or complain as it arrives to the same people who do not reply. I have 15 years of extensive travel experience but that bad I was never treated. Please be careful with this shameful company - TRAVELGENIO... they may be ok if the situation is regular, but when it comes to cancellation it is a nightmare to get any money reimbursed."
"I have 15 years of extensive travel experience------Why then did you choose a company with a terrible reputation, not take out travel insurance, or think you are due anything back anyway from the sort of tickets these bucket shops sell?"

"Airtickets.ie is SCAM. I have just booked the flight for 850 EUR, found on MOMONDO, they charged my credit card and wrote after 3 hours this: Dear Mr. ,We would like to inform you that your booking with code XXXX has been cancelled because no ticketing possibleShould you require further clarifications or would like to make a new booking please do not hesitate to contact us.Chrysanthi Kousoulini+35 3190 15 232support@airtickets.iewww.airtickets.ieFRAUDSTERS I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
"When I try to call they on the number on their website, there is GREEK auto responder and it disconnects. On the website there is information they have support 24/7 NOT TRUE!"
"So hopefully you are contacting your credit card company to have the charge reversed?Next time, research before buying, not after. In general none of these third party sites provide significant savings despite their advertising claims, many end up costing MORE once hidden charges are included, some are downright fraudulent or as close to that as you can get, and nearly all add additional risk and complexity that make any small savings insignificant."
"lukleo, this may come as a shock to you, but not everything you see on a website will be true.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Travelgenio tries to scam a ramdom amount of money from you at the last conrifmation step when booking. They add administration fees to the price and try to hide it to the page so that you would not notice this. Horrible customer service, very bad website. Would not recommend!"
"<They add administration fees to the price and try to hide it to the page so that you would not notice this.>Hmmm. Doesn't seem like they are ""hiding"" anything. It's right in their T&C's (see below).Not that I'd ever use them, but a little basic research, please.Service FeesTRAVELGENIO charges a service fee per passenger as well as a fee for credit card payments. This fee is not refundable under any circumstances, and is independent of the rate selected by the user. In case of modifications on behalf of the client, wherever the tariffs allow, administrative fees may arise.…travelgenio.co.uk/pages/travelgenio-terms-a…"
"The fact that there is a service fee is not exactly hidden, it's in the T&C's which, in the words of many contributors here, 'no one bothers to read'.The fact it exists and is not refundable under any circumstances should make anyone who does bother to read the T&C's like they ought to, run a mile!"

"My husband booked through opodo one time for cdg-Kul flight. It was cheap and no problem whatsoever. I suppose he's lucky. After reading all the comments here, it's better to spend a bit more with the actual airline than having that possibility of going through hassles to get your ticket confirmed."
"I agree with you Bey79. I'm sure that many people do manage to book tickets and don't experience any problems. Many of them will never dream of coming on to a forum and telling everyone that nothing went wrong.But, and it's a very big but, anyone booking with a company like Opodo is very unlikely to be saving any money over booking directly with the airlines. What they will do is to increase the chances of something going wrong, and increase the difficulty of dealing with the situation if it does, or if any changes need to be made, because they are introducing a middle man and another level of complication.I always say it's like playing russian roulette. Eventually you'll find a bullet!"
"Do NOT book a ticket with this travel agency. We have had nothing but trouble. In the end, we ended up buying a new ticket.Esta agencia es HORRIBLE. Todo han sido problemas y al final hemos fenido que comprar un billete nuevo."
"Interestingly I just booked some tickets with ''Airtickets.com' - sydney to Dallas with one web site and airline and then another from Dallas to Jamaica. Deal was good, but you really had to look for the good connections and timing yourself (there are certainly some horrendous ones on there but they are cheap!) - unfortunately I screwed up how much time to leave between the two airlines, not figuring that I would have to recheck in at Dallas as I couldn't be booked 'all the way through from start to finish on the return leg. This is where air tickets.com really let themselves down - I rang to see if I could change to an earlier connection that happened to be via somewhere rather than direct, the one I had originally booked - this flight got me in a few hours earlier to Dallas and is the one I should have booked. Sent and email to the web page as they instruct, got an email back saying call us, called then told they had to wait until someone in the UK could answer and they would email me - they emailed and said you can't make the change from a direct to a via flight.I check US airways rules myself - same airline for the change and original, same start and end stop just that now, I needed to stop off for about an hour. Airline web page clearly says $200usd for any change plus the cost difference in the flat.Checked with the agent 3 times and they said it couldn't be done - even said I could contact the airline but it wouldn't so any good as they would just refer to the booking agent. Sod it, called the airline myself and hey presto, no problem at all sir, $200usd plus $30usd price difference and I will email you your new itninary. Really? Too good to be true? Sure enough a minute later up comes my new schedule online and by email.I'm now about to take air tickets to town for clearly talking a load of tosh.The mistake on booking was mine, but the key is unless you are 100% sure of what you want, any changes with these sorts of fares and travel agents are going to cost. Booking with the airline direct will get you a lot more support and cooperation.Ultimately depends on what is driving you - pure cost or piece of mind!"
"I couldn't agree with you more! I was just going to put a review about them, but you've summed it up wonderfully! They yelled at me when I called, would not let me talk, and they hung up on me. THE. WORST."
"I've booked with a lot of travel agencies, and have worked in customer service for years and I will say Travelgenio was THE WORST! I tried to cancel a flight of mine within the appropriate cancellation period without a penalty. The lady on the phone would not let me cancel and said she would charge me a fee of $38 just to cancel, but that I would not get the rest of my money back. Then I asked to speak with a supervisor and the lady informed me that they didn't have any---then she came back later and told me they were all busy. After trying to get her to listen to me--because she kept talking over me and yelling at me--she told me she would refund then HUNG UP ON ME. I called back...and then they were closed... I didn't know if the money had been refunded so I called back the next day and the gentleman I spoke to told me that it wasn't possible to refund and that I could cancel the ticket, but only with a fee and I would NOT GET MY MONEY BACK. He was also kept talking over me and would not let me talk to a supervisor because they were, ""Occupied."" I filed a case with my bank. These people totally will scam you...DO NOT USE THEM."
"I bought tickets last night on airtickets. There are two layovers from SFO to Denpasar Bali; 1hr at Seat-Tac and about 8 hrs in Singapore. I got a little paranoid after reading some stuff online, but called the airline and they verified that it went through. It worked fine for me and its epically low priced."
called the airline and they verified that it went through. It worked fine for me....------You haven't flown yet
"I've booked to go on a family holiday to Orlando Florida, Easter 2016 and have been looking for flights and prices. I have found a Virgin Atlantic flight for £598 an adult and £543 a child. I would value anyone's advice on the likelihood of anything better? The flights are from Gatwick, direct and good times. I know a lot of airlines do not release their flights and prices till after March or even July, but I am concerned if I wait, I would not get them at this price again, especially as we are travelling on a Saturday and it's over Easter, plus there are 10 in the party and am worried we may not get 10 seats if I leave it any longer. Any advice would be greatly received."
"My advice would be to wait until airlines release their flights, and probably a bit later than that. How can you know you'll get the flights at that price now, even the airline doesn't know what they'll be charging yet. You may well be leaving yourself open to all sorts of misery by using a third party agent, particularly at this stage."
"As most airlines do not release schedules and fares, until about 330 days from the travel date (it seems to vary slightly by airline, but that is the most common number of days in advance), I would wait until at least then, and search ONLY the airlines' Web sites for live prices and schedules (as they exist at that time - later? Who knows?).Hunt"
"Yes, Bill is right, I should have mentioned that you should stick to booking through the airlines own sites. The third party sites where you see low prices are usually designed to lure people in before telling hem the price is no longer available and you need to pay a lot more."
"Don't book at Travelgenio. Prices do increase without explanation before final booking is completed. Credit cards without extra fees are not accepted. You will find out that only, after you have entered the complete information an tried to complete the booking. Travelgenio at least is stealing your time (which is the most important thing you have in life!) and you may end up paying a higher price than advertised."
"I booked a flight on travelgenio between Stuttgart, Germany and Ancona, Italy. As soon as I booked it, I received a confirmation e mail right away like any normal online booking. It said my payment for the booking would be processed 24 hours later and I woudl receive an e mail confirmation. About 24 hours later I received an e mail that simply said: ""Payment of Booking"" and my confirmation number in the e mail subject line. The e mail was co,pletely blank. No text, no instructions, nothing. I thought it was odd, but it seemed to be the confirmation that payment had been processed successfully and I was ""ready to travel"" as the first e mail indicated.To my surprise, when I showed up at the airport for my interantional flight, I was told that the booking was never ticketed because payment was never processed. I was forced to buy a full-fare ticket at the agent counter, which cost double the price I had booked online in advance. A difference of almost 500 euro. After my trip, I contacted Travelgenio explaining the situation and requesting that they issue me a credit for the amount of the difference in the booked fare and the full ticket I was forced to purchase at the airport. Travelgenio refused to issue any credit and said I should have called 48 hours before my flight to confirm I had been ticketed. Has anyone ever done such a thing? I travel constantly for work, have booked literally thousands of tickets online, and have never once called an internet booking website before my flight just to see if they had processed my payment, especially when I receievd what seemed like two confirmation e mails indicating I was booked and ready to travel.To make matters worse, even contacting the company has been a nightmare. Their website is very amateurish, and the form to upload documents to prove what had happened was broken. When I finally got a reply it was in poorly written English basically telling me to buzz off. I will NEVER use Travelgenio again, and would strongly urge consumers to boycott their business. This is not acceptable business practice, and the error of the company cost me several hundred euro."
"""Their website is very amateurish""___And you still went ahead with a booking with them?"
"Do not trust Travelgenio!I made a booking today. there was mentioned that Luggage was included (I even have the prove, because i made a picture of it) and when they sended me the tickets there was mentioned: no lugagge included! I phoned twice but they tell me I have to pay €30 to cancel my reservation or I have to pay more to add Luggage! I will file a complaint but do not make a reservation with them!An"
"It always is a case of buyer beware and without incurring the wrath of readers I wonder how many people become seduced by the price on offer and went ahead with their purchase before reading the T&C's.First thing that be wary of is to make sure the price indicated is in your own currency. I made that mistake once, paid for everything and then realised the cost was in US$ not AU$.Second, the airline advertised can usually offer the same fare at the same price or be at least willing to price match. If you have the time, ring / email them, quote the price the 3rd party provider advertised (you may need to provide them with a link) and be prepared to haggle. It has worked for me more than once.Thirdly, if it is too good to be true it usually is. Cheap usually means an airline is trying to shift awkward seats, i.e. multiple stops, early / late departures, no / low luggage allowances, long stopovers etc. Again, read the fine print. How additional much inconvenience are you willing to tolerate to save a few dollars, Euro's etc.Personally, I have used Tripsta, www.booking.com (my favourite) and travelgenio multiple times with no problems.Edited: 5 years ago "
My booking went through on this website...I've just confirmed it with Virgin...they are legit

"Travelgenio is a big con! Do not use them!I have booked and paid for flights (back in Jan) to go on holiday in Koh Samui, Thailand. I have just received notification that one of the legs I've booked (from Bangkok to London Heathrow) no longer operates with Thai Airways.Thai Airways have confirmed that this flight TG916 still operates daily!I've asked Travelgenio to advise what their alternative plan is or whether they will provide a refund and they just don't respond.Its amazing that internet companies can just ""hide"" - not be accountable and as soon as they receive your money they change the rules.We will be taking our complaint to the Ombudsman, but my advice is not to get involved with Travelgenio in the first place!"
Airtickets is based out of Greece... you will never get ahold off them unless you are unrelentless like myself sending emails one after another.... They claim they had called me numerous times but said they could not get a connection... so i contacted the airline supplier to light a fire under their behinds in the mean time resending email every hour... and called for almost two months... only to be cut off or hung up on because they can not speak fluent english..... they have $1600.00 of mine and i wont give up.... i will be their worst nightmare....It helps to know contacts such as barristers who focus on helping individuals manage and resolve these situations through arbitration ADR or dispute through litigation. Be sure to contact one who is focused and educated in international arbitration and litigations....and act as counsel to enforce it.BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST WATCH CLOSELY IF YOU ARE USING A TRAVEL SEARCH ENGINE AS IT SHOWED I WAS DEALING WITH MY LOCAL AIRLINE WESTJET.....BUT ONCE I BOOKED I WAS SENT A LARGE BILL AS IT SHOWED MY TOTAL ON WESTJET IN CANADIAN DOLLARS......BUT ONCE BOOKED I WAS SENT A EMAIL FROM AIRTICKETS WHICH CHARGES IN EUROS!!!!!! VERY BIG DIFFERENCE AND VERY SNEAKY.... STAY AWAY .....VERY FAR AWAY FROM AIRTICKETS.COM .....THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY THEN MAKE COMMUNICATION IMPOSSIBLE..... but i fEAR THEY BARKED UP THE WRONG TREE I HAVE NOTHING BUT TIME TO HARASS THEM UNTIL ALL FORMS AND REPORTS FOR MY CLAIM GO THROUGH.......
"Thank you for all the CAPITAL LETTERS, I'm sure it will help complete idiots who think that knowing a barrister will help them."
"DO NOT book throught this site if you are in Australia booked return flights Brisbane to Melbourne .Th evening before his flight he received an email saying that his flights were cancelled as payment had since been made outside of warranty period and in order to retrieve booking an extra au 263.00 had to be paid .This was paid as he had a commitment in Melbourme and that that late stage it was hard to book other flights .I have since rung and queried this as was told the booking was made on 18 th March and paid on 19 th March .This compant is in Spain and has a time difference of aprox 10 hrs .When I pointed this out they were not impressed .Iasked what date it was there and was told 23 rd March and then said "" well here in Australia it.s the 24 th March so had does that work with your booking with Australians ? "" They will not refund the extra paid so be aware of this"
"Beware! Airtickets.com are scam artists. In my case, after purchasing flight tickets they emailed me that the flight was canceled and they wanted to reschedule it. When I’ve canceled, they said that the money will be returned in within 6 weeks. There’s not three months and the money are still not returned."

"I booked internal USA flights with Travelgenio. They sent me a confirmation email followed by one saying my Visa card was declined, however the money came out of my account. When I contacted them they said there was a mistake on their end and they would book me on the next available flight. That ended up being two days later than my planned flight. Apparently, my refund will come in soon.Now I cant book the original flight and instead have had to spend far more money on alternate flights, that will leave me tight to catch my return transatlantic flight.Absolute amateurs and cowboy traders. Completely avoid them."
"Well, I would NEVER recommend Travelgenio again, I consider them fraudulent and rude !!!Booked a flight, paid with credit card straight away (Amex as offered), they send a conformation email. Next day they send another email asking for payment again, no explanation why but I figured it, now they only accept Visa and MC. I pay again the full amount, they sending an automated confirmation email; checked my account, yep, they deducted the money straight away. Going online to book my seat, no booking, Reference unknown. I call the airline, they advise no booking for me in the system. I email Travelgenio 3 times, only get automatic replies with references numbers. Research the net to find Australian phone number, find one that is not in Spain.Call them, speak to an operator and she advises the fare went up and that is why I have no booking, have to pay extra. When I argued that I have paid and they took my money, issued a confirmation number but I received no ticket and not even advise of an extra fee. Travelgenio changed the price AFTER quoting and taking my money, now only offering to cancel or pay extra. Upon me insisting to honour my booking she advised it was MY fault, no supervisor available and hang up!Called Travelgenio again, spoke with another operator, this time writing down his details and got the same story. Long story short, had to pay extra for THEIR incapability. They advised I would get confirmation in latest 2 hours. I called after 3 hours, just to be advised to wait another hour. another broken promise, called again an hour later and finally got the confirmation email after insisting. Remember, if I would have not called them, I would not even have known that I had no flight to an important Business meeting.Be warned and careful, I consider their way of business fraudulent, unethical and rude. Better to pay a bit more directly with the airline"
"Hello BillieIt's a shame you didn't read all the previous warnings about hem going back to August 2013 in this thread alone. As is said here all the time, book with the airlines and avoid all of this frustration, and hassle. It's frustrating that so many people have to endure an unpleasant experience before coming to the same conclusion."
"I booked domestic flights in Australia via travelgenio.com without issues. I made payment and received my itinerary within half an hour after confirmation. the only thing to note is the TWO different airline codes shown on your itinerary. One code is the referene for the travelgenio.com website the other code which is shown in the itinerary details is the airline website reference. Payment went through okay, confirmation received and I was able to access my booking via the airline website where I could check-in And print my boarding pass without any issues. I guess if you have your doubts about it then go with the safest option and book direct with the airline or travel agent, however my experience wasnt at all like any of these reviews although if I had read these reviews I honestly would not have booked my flight on travelgenio which saved me $100 in the end. As it was EUR converting into AUD (as it is a spanish website) bit odd but in the end I saved money .. No conversion rates or fees were charged as I paid the AUD amount that became $100 less than what was on the airlines website! Not all experiences are the same I guess im just grateful mine was a good one"
I found cheap tickets with airtickets but was not able to book my baggage at the same time. The website said that I was to ring them afterwards to book in my baggage. It then cost 200 euros to take 2 bags to and from manchester to Greece. I will never book through this company again and would not recommend anyone else to do so.
"Maybe send a PM to the poster above you, and ask how they got so fortunate. Perhaps they can even give you the name of their agent (usually mentioned prominently in such posts), to help you out.Sorry that you did not find TA and this thread before you got hosed.Good luck,Hunt"
"Just paid 130 € for a flight from hong kong to shangai with airtickets.com! At the moment my bank freed the cash, theybsend me the message the flight couldn't be booked! I send them an email, and they answered; sorry! In a few hours your money will be returned.......Didn't happen yet!Scary!Aftherwards there have been some atempts to loothe my account.,,,, ( didn't work out though)"
"Don't use this company , I booked and paid for return flights with 23kg baggage from NZ to Australia ,went to check in and was told my booking was for carry on luggage only , result $250.00 . Can't seem to contact them , won't reply to emails , phone contacts are just a recording , just a big scam I think ."
Do you still have the original email from when you booked? What luggage does that say you have included?
"As a frequent flyer, I am trying always to book from the airline company directly, even if is 5-10 euro more expensive.In case this is not feasible, I am using airtickets. since 2009. Never had a problem even with a recent flight from Krakow to Warsaw operated by LOT company. Some weeks before flight, LOT changed the flight time and I surprisingly received a mail from airtickets stating that the flight time changed and if I would like to keep the reservation. I was nervous until I was on board, but everything was fine. My first booking was in 2009, with an Etihad flight, Athens- Doha via Abu Dabhi and back. Mission accomplished without scratch.The truth is that in the past I had some issue, but it was more a charging issues not booking. Such as, if you use a credit card you may be charged plus 1-2 euros, or to wait many days for a refund. As a Greek, I know that such issues are caused by our horrible banking system, in which they are charging you for everything and a delay is expected if you want your money back. Trapezites koufales, erxontai kremales!Off topic. I was laughing with a post, stating that a ""typical"" 6 hour round trip from Athens- Greece to Larnaca- Cyprus turned to be 22 hours caused by airtickets fault. For your info Athens- Larnaca is less that 2 hours flight. hahaha , liars!tip: Do not confuse airtickets with airticketsdirect.Disclaimer :P : This is my opinion. I have used airfasttickets in the past too without problem, but I know now that is scam. Also, I have never used the other companies."
"For your info Athens- Larnaca is less that 2 hours flight. hahaha , liars!=====Did it occur to you that the agency messed up and sold them a non direct flight with an extended layover?"
"Today Athens- Larnaca route is served with 7 direct flights daily. You don't mess with a non direct flight for a destination with such number of direct flight.For my point of view I think this comment was spam, but let's stay on topic!"
Today Athens- Larnaca route is served with 7 direct flights daily. You don't mess with a non direct flight for a destination with such number of direct -------Some people will go to extreme lengths to save a few pounds. Or it may be they were completely hapless and choose a cheaper flight without looking at the routing. Or the agency fooled them. Or all of those.
"I agree with joe.George, I do love your disclaimer, which for me, translates to 'This company is not a scam. I've used them for six years with only minor problems. I've used other companies without any problems too, even though they turned out to be a scam in the end'. This, and the stuff about direct flights being two hours etc etc without an appreciation of how some of these OTA's work, just undermines everything you have said."
"Hello Roj,thank you for the reply.That is my feeling for the specific agency. I don't know how to express it in English, but is goes like ""Innocent until proven guilty"" :PRegarding the off topic , I have never heard someone to use a non direct flight from Greece to Cyprus as it is like a domestic flight for us. Having in mind the 7 direct flights per day from 3 different companies I evaluate the post I read many pages ago as a fake."
"I don't think that you realise how many people will use a dodgy company to save a small amount of money, not realising or not caring that the cheapest itinerary produced by them could involve a long stopover and flights that go 'around the houses'. You'd be better advised to take the opposite view of agencies. As far a I'm concerned all third parties are useless (guilty) until the volume of evidence proves otherwise."
"Regarding the off topic , I have never heard someone to use a non direct flight from Greece to Cyprus as it is like a domestic flight for us. Having in mind the 7 direct flights per day from 3 different companies I evaluate the post I read many pages ago as a fake.====I can give you very real example. I sometimes fly Heathrow to Edinburgh for business. Thats about a 90 minute flight. When I book it on my company travel system, as well as the ""obvious"" such as Heathrow to Edinburgh (doh!) it will also offer me Heathrow to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Edinburgh, on the grounds its £5 cheaper ! Never mind its now about 5 hours.So, I can imagine someone either not realising they are buying two flights, or saving five pounds, or the travel agency doesn't show the full routing, and then such routing, with perhaps some delays and an overnight stay, becomes 22 hours."
I'm sure you can sense a tad bit of aggravation... wouldn't you be annoyed?
"NEVER use travelgenio!They do not get call for customer service.Also do not answer email.How terrible !!I booked flight ticket and also added a flexible date option, which was almost 100 dollars.But I cannot use this option!!"
Under no circumstances use travelgenio...they are scammers
"I initially had a problem with Travelgenio, but when I called and spoke to a Manager and the service instantly changed for me. I would recommend them but with all service providers if there is an issue call and talk to them but be patient. I am booking my next flights with them directly."
"just discovered their rip off regardless of their statements through the whole process with the amount being charged stated all the way through the process as $2538.16: with the statement: 'Best available rate paying with Maestro, incl. basic rate, taxes, fees, and any applicable discounts. The total price choosing a different payment methods is max 2571.60 AUD.' And yet, when you get to the payment screen it doesn't matter what card you use it increases the price by about $200+ . won't be using their 'service'."
agreed
Do not use airtickets.com as I did. They will figure out a way to not live up to their end of the bargain.
"Dealing with Travelgenio (Travel2be.com) has been a complete nightmare. There are so many bad reviews for this company which are beyond 200% true but unfortunately I came across the reviews after I booked with them. I had such a difficult time changing my reservation. They do not have a toll free number (you will be charged international fees to call Spain). I have used the online submission forms so many times and I kept getting the run around when I asked them to change my reservation. I finally disputed the transaction with them since they were not able to help me and I could not trust that I even had a flight anymore due to their lack of customer service and automated responses which could not even decipher proper English. They kept sending me threatening emails to pay for the ticket on alternate websites. THE SKETCHIEST COMPANY I'VE EVER DEALT WITH. Please spare yourself the drama, headache, and non-refundable money with no help and book with the hundreds of other trusted companies."
"I made a booking with Travelgenio to travel from Auckland to New Delhi return via Melbourne departing on 2nd September Tickets were issued for this. Then Air India cancelled their flight on 2nd from Melbourne to Delhi and re-booked me on 3rd. Travelgenio reissued me tickets to travel from Melbourne to New Delhi on 3rd but I still have the leg to Melbourne on the 2nd. I asked for the Auckland to Melbourne leg to also be on the 3rd. A booking for this flight on the 3rd shows up on my Quantas frequent flyer account (who code-share with Air India?) as a good to go confirmed booking. However Travelgenio have not issued the tickets for this flight. They don't answer my emails any more. QANTAS won't deal with me directly. QANTAS say I have to go thru Travelgenio travel agency to get tickets issued. It is all very confusing. I WOULD NEVER USE TRAVELGENIO AGAIN. Customer care is -1 out of 10. I just hope I can get my ticket for the 3rd issued, that are waiting there for me kindly provided by QANTAS at no additional cost to anybody, so that I don't have to bother with an unwanted overnight in Melbourne ."
I do not understand. You are stating that a <<good to go confirmed booking>> but also <<Travelgenio have not issued the tickets>>If you have a confirmed booking you can access electronically then you are fine.What is the status of this (confirmed booking or reservation)?
"I personally had a good experience with Travelgenio. So far I bought tickets via Expedia, Airtickets.com, Vayama.com, Hotwire.com and never had an issue. The only ""problem"" I had was the ticket I bought via Expedia because of the flight change and had to buy a new ticket while waiting for almost a month to get the money back from the first ticket I bought.Edited: 5 years ago "
Esta compania Travelgenio es un FRAUDE. Me han cobrado dos veces por un pasaje de Colombia a Copenhagen y mañana es el vuelo y no existe pasaje alguno. Cancelaron el ticket sin informarme y me robaron mi dinero. Llamo y llamo a su serivicio de 24 horas y solo personas incompetentes y sin ningun tipo de experiencia me responden que espere. Que espere que? Nunca me dejaron hablar con el manager ni nadie me dice que pasa. Mientras tanto que tienen mi plata ROBO. Ahora que leo en internet no soy la primera a la que roban hay muchas quejas en la pagina de tripadvisor que si es seria. Ustedes deberían rebozar tener a travelgenio en estas noticias.
"Travelgenio is the worst company to book your tickets with. Don't trust them. They charged us for the same ticket twice, we had to call several times and demand to have the double charging solved. It took them more than a week and then the ticket which we thought we had purchased didn't exist. We are still waiting for the money to be given back to us, but also have no ticket. It's a scam and the company should be shut down!"
>> They charged us for the same ticket twice <<contact your card company/bank and report an unauthorised payment
"As Carol says, you're contacting the wrong company to get the double charges issue resolved - speak to your bank or Credit Card supplier."

travelguide73 I've reported your profile via the help centre. You're not getting the message are you?
"Do NOT book with travelgenio! I booked a trip to San Francisco with them, when I got to the airport I had not ticket even though I had an email confirming my flight and an eticket with travelgenio. The airline could see that I was booked but then it was cancelled. I have been given so many excuses for why this happened, they claim the payment didn't go through, however my credit card company sees no attempt from the travel company to take the payment. AND why would they confirm my flight and give me an eticket if the payment hadn't gone through! Such a huge disappointment!!"
"<<Do NOT book with travelgenio>Thank YOU !! I was really undecided, as there were only 216 negative posts before yours, but the 217th has really pushed me over the edge.On another matter, that of just turning up at the airport to discover the ticket was cancelled weeks ago, that's a cardinal sin on your part (other than just randomly booking with whoever promised you the cheapest price without doing any further checking.). You should always be regularly checking on your booking, and you should checkin online as soon as possible (usually T-24) to pick up issues including ones as catastrophic as this, at least you have 24 hours to fix it then and are at home not at the airport with very few options.Added to this you never looked at your credit card statements, in fact you appear to have done nothing but go click click click buy and then turn up at the airport weeks or months later.This will likely be a very expensive lesson for you. Next time, check everything keep checking, and book direct."
"Travelgeno charged my VISA card in the same moment I bought a flight online. Later Travelgeno responded back to me, that they could not deliver the flight for the price which was already charged on my card. They informed me I had to pay another 60 Euro, because the price has changed.I responded back that I could buy this ticket cheaper from a different travel agency online, so I wanted to be refunded. This was OK and after a week I got my money back on my credit card. Only problem was that I was short of $75,91 on my credit card on the transaction with Travelgeno Madrid. I called travelginos Norwegian number at customer service +47 23960886 in order to have my situation resolved quickly. I got to speak to a nice girl and explained the below situation in detail for her. She spoke to her supervisor Mr. Pelar and I got a quite chocking reply. His answer was apparently that I was refunded the full amount I paid in Norwegian crones and any other expenses on this transaction would be mine.My account is an us account so the difference is properly currency expenses.I have sent Travelgino several emails in regards to this, but their approach to the problem is just to ignore me.This means that they think it is fare that I lost $76 on a product they could not deliver. Wonder if they even are allowed to charge my credit card before they have checked they can deliver the product?Please stay far away from buying anything from this company. They are not serious at all."
"Travelgenio = Terrible! Utterly terrible. I can't believe I was just the unlucky one. I have had about 30 interactions / attempted interactions with them in the past few days hours, and I cannot believe it.https:/…www.travelgenio.comI have had a terrible experience.I hate them!"
I have a had the same experience with being ignored!They are hand down the WORST travel company I have ever dealt with.
"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt this was necessary to warn others.I booked a flight through Skyscanner and now wish I listened to my gut feeling! I knew I shouldn't have booked with this dodgy company!A few weeks later, I needed to change my flight, so called the airline directly and they said no problem, no change fee, only a fare difference would need to be paid.However, the change needed to be done through Travelgenio as I booked with them. So I tried to contact Travelgenio. First, it took 4 days and 4 different emails until they responded to me(!!!!), second they said I would need to pay ""a penalty fee of 74 € + 30 € of service fee per passenger, if there is availability at the same rate. If not there will also be a fare difference.""Travelgenio are trying to charge me 100 EUR for nothing. The airline would have done it for free.If I wasn't in such a rush trying to book these flights on my phone while in a taxi, I would have booked directly with the airline s I normally do. The flights would have cost the same too!Stupid me.I am still at war with this company. They are still wasting my time, not making the changes that I've been trying to confirm, not answering their Australian call center in English but instead with a German speaker (WTF!), and are just costing me money on being on hold waiting for them to answer their phone, and in the meantime the flight price had increased! Cementing... worst travel agency I have ever experienced.It has been 9 hours since I last emailed them wondering why they still have not made the change to my booking. No reply. As expected from this $h!t company.They have also blocked me from their Facebook page after I posted this Trustpilot page. What a bunch of losers, trying to hide how rubbish they really are."
"I just booked 2 days ago a trip from Paris to Istanbul on air tickets.com.tr. They billed my visa right away. The next day they sent me an email saying that the trip was cancelled. The reason was written in Turkish so I had to ask them what it meant and was informed that because of the debt crisis in Greece, where air tickets is headquartered, Turkish Airlines will not allow them to sell they seat. The refund came through the next day but I lose 40.51 because they did not refund the same day they billed me so the exchange rate was different. And the message was 'tough luck'."
"Travelgenio are trying to charge me 100 EUR for nothing. The airline would have done it for free.-------But didn't you find a cheaper ticket with travelgenio? Isn't that why you used them? So you are trading off a cheaper ticket with higher change cost vs more expensive ticket with lower change cost. Add to that,you are using a company that will be running on razor thin margins, so again, that's why it took them along time to answer the phone, they have a few people maxxed out selling tickets and dealing with other matters isn't top priority.This all comes down to what you want is to have your cake and eat it , and get the best of all worlds,lowest fare and lowest change fees and best customer service all from one company. So whilst I have neve and never would, use Travelgenio, in this case your expectations are the issue, and they have done nothing more than fulfil the terms and conditions you agreed to about change fare. The $100 isn't ""for nothing"" it's the trade off and you agreed to it up front."
"Stay away from airtickets. They just canceled my reservation because of ""technical difficulties"". I found a good rate on airtickets on a flight from Europe to Canada. Purchased the tickets and canceled the tickets that i had on hold with another company. One day later airtickets sent an email that the tickets are canceled. I called them and explained that the tickets went up by $300 and they didn't care. Now I don't have my reservation with either one of the companies and am loosing $300 because of a company that has nothing better to do than waste your time. Shame on this company, at least they could have given a discount for the inconvenience."
"I wonder way Travelgenio has been able to operate so long without being blocked for all business and black listed from all web sites.Travelgenio is nothing else than a huge scam set up, that has got away with fraud a long time without consequences.There must be a legal way to have this stopped and a way to make them responsible for all the customers they have tricked and fooled?They very often operate like this:First they annouce a cheap ticket from A to B. This ticket has a little lower price than the companies they compete with. You book it and they charge your credit card immediately and you believe everything is OK, but you will not receive any ticket confirmation. After a day or two they will finally send you an email stating that a ticket cannot be issued because the airline has changed the price. You will be asked to bay approximately 100 Euro more (Depend on how much the ticket costed in the first place). Most people believe this is the case and pay the additional cost in order to get the ticket. If you instead check the prices the other companies are able to sell the same ticket for, you will soon realize that this is a scam. You always have the option to cancel and ask for a refund. They will refund you after a week or, so but if you have had any expenses using your card. Currency exchange rate etc. If you use a card with a different currency than the one you pay the ticket with, there is a fee for buying and selling this currency. Many time this expense can be 50 to 100 euro. Travelgenio will never refund you this loss. They state that this is your own expense. Then you can ask. How can they legally charge their customers credit card without first checking the can deliver the product?They make good money every they on first giving a false price then ask for more money. If you decline, you will loose money anyhow in fees. Therefore a lot of customers feel or are forced to go through with this purchase.PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM TRAVELGENIO, do not voluntarily let then steel money from you.I refused to pay the extra cost they required me to pay. I lost $75 on the transaction, but the ticket a competing travel company had were much lower than the original price Travelgenio asked for."
"Well i thought i happened to be another victim of the firm. Fortunately I was not. It all started when i without any second thought booked flight that seemed to be perfect. as it usually happens,they sent you confirmation withing a few minutes. Not this time. I panicked,googled and ended up here. Covered with a cold sweat after reading all the feedback, 99%of which negative i gave in. in vain In tried to call,i wrote emails. finally it took them around 3 hours to write back and sent confirmation letter. so i calmed down. only The next day they answered my complaints and double checked if i still wanted to cancel the booking. I hurriedly answered and waited and waited and waited. All in all i can say they are slow,maybe because located in Spain n there is lousy connection, but luckily for me turned out to be reliable. I didn't noticed any ruddiness or incapability to answer in English. As for ""extra"" charges wasn't surprise either cause i knew they charge in euro. I hope this will help someone not to panic like i did reading some really weird comments."
DON`T TRUST TRAVELGENIO!!!! they steal your money - just like they did from me!!! and then they dont reply or do anythinhg! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
i had to cancel my booking due to i felt sick and not fit to travel as i have been advised from a local doctor. travelgenio did not replay to my emails and not bother to refund my flight ticket fees.bad customer services and i'm not recomend it .
travelgenio ripped me off with $1015.00 .
"So, the tickets you had were fully refundable then? If so, that is very rare for someone to buy those these days. You also read the T&C's of both travelgenio and the airline didn't you before you ticked the box! Lucky that you have travel insurance. You do have travel insurance right?"
"Airtickets es la peor compañia del mundo, he tenido la peor experiencia en años viajando, ayer en la noche no pude hacer mi check in en la pagina, airfrance fue la compañia que solucionó mi inconveniente y a ellos les debo la solución, gestión y oportuna atención... airtickets no tiene linea abierta 24h, ni sabia lo que estaba pasando conmigo... Hoy en la mañana fui al aeropuerto porque nadie en su linea me haba contestado y mi vuelo estaba por salir a las 2 de la tarde, es increible que solo me enviarán un email diciendo que supuestamente se habian intentado comunicar conmigo, pero que no estaba disponible, cuando no he podido ni dormir de los nervios, esperando la llamada de ellos, porque solo tienen una opción de gestión en su web... se que confiamos en nuestra condición de clientes la solvencia de todos nuestros problemas con esta compañia, yo no volveré a optar nunca mas por compra de mi tickets online y menos con este tipo de empresas, hay un manejo incoherente e incapaz en esta empresa. De verdad me siento robada y afectada emocionalmente, este viaje me ha costado cerca de 3000 euros y no puedo creer que sigan estando girando en la red este tipo de fraudes e incompetencia.Los odio y comparto ese sentimiento de rencor como todos hemos expuesto aquí..."
Really bad experience with this company. Had to change my flights last minute do to a family emergency and each time I rang the call centre my call was cut off after I had just explained what I need to. As a result I missed the dead line to change my flights. Asked to speak to a supervisor and was told NO. Don't bother save your money and go with a reputable travel agent.
"I booked a domestic flight with Spicejet Airline on their website for 2 pax and made payment on 13 Jul 2015 using my MasterCard. My card issuer has confirmed that a payment of GBP108.46 + a Non-Sterling Transaction Fee of £3.19 = GBP 111.65 was made. I e-mailed the Airline’s Head Office based in Gurgaon, India to confirm my Flight Booking Reference (PNR). Initially they claimed that my payment was not received. They subsequently requested that I provide them details of my MasterCard to enable them to trace my payment so that they could make a refund. My friends in India informed me that this is a very unreliable airline. This warning has come too late for me. Spicejet eventually refunded my payment. I have re-booked my flight with another airline. I sincerely hope anyone of you reading this will think twice before flying with this Airline. You have been warned."
"I want to share my one and only experience with whoever is contemplating using Travelgenio. I booked a ticket through their website and my card blocked the transaction. So the first attempt was my bank avoiding possible scam being made on my account. So knowing the charge and transaction was declined and voided. I looked up the flights again and booked again, this time it went through and I received my booking #. Travelgenio took it upon themselves to take my credit card information and try the transaction again on their own accord. They did not prompt me nor tell me they would try again due to the first attempt being declined. So now at this point I had a double booking with two #s. I contacted them on the phone and wow, first of all the language barrier in itself was ridiculous to explain what had happened and getting them to realize that it was their fault for this double booking, I did not authorize them to try again, nor did they ask me. So I couldn't get a travelgenio agent to understand and they don't have managers to speak too. So I wrote an email to customer service and they understood and said They will contact airlines to see ""if"" they'd refund me. IF? luckily they told me that I would be getting a full refund back 30 to 45 days from the transaction date. 54 days later, Nothing! I responded back in the chain email and asked what was going on, why haven't I received my refund, and I have still not been given a response, I called and they are telling me they have no record of anything such case for a refund. Im blown away by this con, scam or whatever you may call it to not give me back my money. I have now filed with my bank to get my money back. Please beware of this 3rd party vendor, being international business and foreign to complying with customer care or even understanding in illegal transactions. I really suggest using someone else. Its not worth it, if something goes wrong with flights or booking , ITS A MESS."
"Roy O,Paragraphs would be very nice, and greatly appreciated.Thanks,Hunt"
"NEVER USE TRAVELGENIO!This company is trying to get money from their customers in a very embarrassing way. I booked a ticket with them and purchased a product called Flexible Ticket (99€!!!) to be able to change my dates flexibly as it is stated in their terms and conditions. When I called the company to make a change on my return flight, they told me that this was not possible anymore, since I have to make these changes BEFORE even entering my FIRST FLIGHT. This is NOT MENTIONED anywhere in the English or German version of their terms and conditions. They only mention it in their Spanish version, translated it wrong and in this way, try to get the money out of their customers. This is such a big scam and so disappointing! TRAVELGENIO NEVER AGAIN !"

"I just made a booking for Aeroflot flights with airtickets24.com for the very first time a week ago. (I don't know if airtickets24.com and airtickets.com that you asked are the same site or not, though.) The process was smooth with no hassle and I got confirmation e-mail and e-ticket within a few minutes. There was no charge for my payment with Master Card. Other cards would be charged a fee which I cannot remember how much.I later read on a TripAdvisor forum that the problems some people encountered with the web site is when they want to get a refund because something went wrong with their booking. That's the only problems I heard."
"I'd like to add that after reading more about these web sites, however, I am kinda scared and I will probably never do business with them again.I must admit that I made a mistake by booking with them without checking first about them. I just hope I am lucky and get on my flights in a couple of weeks with no problems."
"Probably way too late for me to read all this! Hubby got to airport for 5 am flight & they had nothing on him, even with confirmation # on email document. He had to purchase a new ticket right then. Now, I find a new email wanting our payment. WTF, I did that when I bought the ticket 2 days ago with ""their"" confirmation. Yes, it was a rushed last minute scheduling & I used my app. Need to ck bank acct ASAP (debit card). #learnedthehardway"
"NEVER use travelgenio. Four days before an international flight I booked months ago I received an email saying they had changed one (of three) flights to 24 hours later. I was given the options of a) wait in the Bangkok airport for 24 hours, no hotel offered or b) accept a refund for that flight only. After 30+ minutes of arguing (half on hold) I managed to get a refund for the entire itinerary and had to rebook (using a different site) last minute. The woman I spoke with actually said ""what is it you're wanting me to do?"" I will never recommend their site. Be warned!"
"<<had to rebook (using a different site) last minute>>Hope that this was not through any other skonky 3rd party agents.Did that second itinerary work for you?Travel safely,Hunt"

"Travelgenio is the biggest scam EVER! I made a huge mistake by booking through them thinking I'd ""save"" money. I wish I had booked through the airline directly.They charged me more than CHF 100 from the original price eventhough I have the confirmation via E-Mail. The customer service doesn't even speak english so its a long road to even get feedback or refund."
"Booked a flight from Saskatoon Canada to Heathrow.was $847 cdn return. When I got my credit card bill it was $1086. Yet they emailed me a receipt for the $847. So I called. I sent them all the info they needed. Still waiting for my refund from them. Flight was good. No problem with that. I also used skyscanner. Airtickets.com is bases in Greece. They say my claim is going through their accounting and because of the situation there right now, it's going to take longer than usual. F*ckers. Gone on trip and am back. Now it's been close to 2 months. Calling them tomorrow. I always use skyscanner for domestic sites. As for international, don't deal with airtickets.com. bunch of f*cktards."

"Please stay away from Travelgenio and Travel2be. I booked a flight, paid everything and in the evening (9 pm) they send me the ""offer"" to pay an extra 40 euros because the flight company had canceled the seats. This ""offer"" was only valid for that day. I saw those e-mails on Saturday and didn't trust it. I called the company which is located in Madrid and they told me that they had canceled everything because I didn't pay the extra money. This is such a illegal way of working. You are not allowed to offer something, let costumers pay and then after that checking whether the flight company still has the seats available. Save yourself a lot of trouble by booking your flight with another company!"
"Travelgenio is a (spanish) scam company and they steal your money. You never get your ticket. When you put your cc info they make charge. Only way is to co-op with your bank, close card asap, wait when your CC bill comes, make reclamation trough your bank. I also recommend that you give a hint of this company to your police economy crime department."
"You are not allowed to offer something, let customers pay and then after that checking whether the flight company still has the seats available.--------Yes you are. Many third parties work this way."
">>You are not allowed to offer something, let costumers pay and then after that checking whether the flight company still has the seats available.<<It's even in the terms and conditions you accept this will happen. Agreeing to stuff without reading it is really what shouldn't be allowed."
I also informed Momondo from this scam.

After I purchased the air ticket from them, I immediately received a confirmation email stating I had paid for the air ticket with my booking reference and my personal information there was correct. After half an hour or an hour, I received another email for the e-ticket. Therefore, I went on the airline website with my booking reference number and typed my last name, I managed to see the flight information was correct. I also went back to the travelgenio website and checked for the status of the booking, and everything was alright…So I was kinda relieved…But now I’m nervous and worried after reading all the negative reviews about travelgenio. Most of the cases here were either to deal with cancelling air tickets (refunding) and changing of the day of flight. My flight is next month, I hope there wont be any accidents/changes that happen later…."
"After Momondo contacted Travegenio in my case, they sent elect ticket. Only drawback was that my flight from Nuremberg to Munich is a BUS! Not plane. So keep away from Travelgenio (and Travel2be)."

We get it's not a joke but there's no need to sneak in an expletive here. Your post will probably be removed.
"And also, SkyScanner is just a search engine for flights, and they accept advertising linked to pay for the service you get for free from them. It was your choice to select a rubbish third part *advertiser* on SkyScanner to throw your money at without doing any research."
this is the worst of the worst they made mistake and i call them from uk for my refound they always give excuse saying the girl dealing with it is out they will refound the money more than 4 weeks now nothing they are bad
Any customers who require assistance regarding their bookings can contact us at customer.service@travelgenio.com We will be pleased to assist.Some transactions require us to contact the airline. This may mean that our agents will take a few more hours to reply to you. We apologise for the delay. Thank you very much. Best regards.
"Bought a flight to Greece and back couple of weeks ago. A week later one of my friends who bought the same flight from another travel agency told me the flight was canceled. That surprised me because I did not receive any information about that from Travelgenio. So I contacted the carrier - the flight was really canceled. Several days later I still didn't received any message from Travelgenio so I called them by myself. Travelgenio: ""Ooops... yes, the flight was canceled, I will send you a confirmation right know by e-mail...""Me: ""THAT I KNOW! What alternatives do you offer me?""Travelgenio: ""Hm... Let me see... It's not possible to fly on the same date you have booked for, but there's a flight one day before or we can do refund""Me: ""OK, when I can get the money back?""Travelgenio: ""Bla-bla-bla... In 1-2 Months... Bla-bla-bla""Me: ""???""Travelgenio: ""You can also contact the carrier, this can speed up the process...""I called the carrier, they told me that the ticket is issued under Hahn Air ticket. Now I'm supposed to get in touch with Hahn Air? Why? Is the role of Travelgenio in this story to take money and disappear? Should it ever exist then? Since then I'm trying to get the money back with no success so far...NEVER, NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM TRAVELGENIO.KAUFEN SIE NIE ETWAS BEI TRAVELGENIO."
The consistent advice given here is to book with the airline directly if you want a better experience.

"At the time when my travel was booked Airport Passenger Duty was collected in respect of 2 children. At the time of travel this duty had been removed from child fares. I have tried for months to get this money back - the airline, Icelandair, would only reimburse through these agents.......my experience highlights that travelgenio are incompetent. Firstly the muddied the waters by failing to address the request which was clearly presented, then they say that there us jo entitlement to receive the reimbursement - finally, the have said that they will seek to recover but will charge 30 euro per passenger to collect the reimbursement. I haven't given up and will now seek some help from Icelandair. Meanwhile, my advice - DO NOT USE TRAVELGENIO ."
"I'd give up trying to get a refund of APD - many/most third parties and even some airlines take care to set an admin charge that's the same - or even higher - than what you'd get back. You of course have no contract with Icelandair and they're nothing to do with you, as you chose to ask a third party to book tickets for you, so their response is correct.Did you save much by not booking direct?"
"Hi,I booked 6 tickets through travelgenio. they charged me the cost of the six tickets. subsequently the airlines i.e. gulf air and emirates also charged me the same amount again. double charged for same tickets. Have contacted Travelgenio but no response as yet."
Hello;We apologise for any inconvenience caused.Send us all the details to this email address: customer.service@travelgenio.comOur team will review the incident and we will keep you informed.Best regards.
<<subsequently the airlines i.e. gulf air and emirates>>That is a bit of a strange combination. What route do you intend to fly?
"Never use them! Worst company ever! Lost €900 to them because they refused point blank to have contact with the airline I was flying with, even though the airline was willing to facilitate my changes but couldn't because I booked through a third party company. Worst customer service ever."
"Travelgenio is the WORST booking company ever!! The customer service is unfriendly, un useful. I was disgusted. Hidden Fees, Not working Insurance, wrong email adresses and i forget some misadventures with this Ripp Off Agency. Get you ticket somewhere else you will make you a favor!!A disgusted custumer"
"When you say hidden fees, do you mean the fees and charges that are laid out in the T&C's which you didn't read but just agreed to?Or do you mean that they were truly hidden and not mentioned anywhere at all ont he website or during the booking process?"
"Travelgenio was a nightmare with my last flight. The 'cheapest' ticket from Rome to Singapore was via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Nobody told me it's from a completely different airport in Instanbul. No direct airport transfer service. US$60 to get a visa to change airports (for Australians). It took 2 hours by bus to get to the city centre and another 1/5hrs with another bus to get to Atakurk. When I called Travelgenio 3 times and asked to speak to a superviser, the woman wouldn't allow me to.I will never book with them again.I agree, use skyscanner and then book directly with the airline."
Just wondering if your flight progressed successfully?
"^^^^^^^^^^^Who are you posting to Gavin H? And of course, anyone else's flight experience has no relationship to yours. Good luck."
"I was replying to royroyroy106, #255. Nov 04, 2015, 10:33 PM"
Travelgenio is absolutely horrible.
"oh hi, im just got back from my trip.i had absolutely no problem with the flight.It went well, no delays and yea, everything was alright.I was quite worried that i might not be allowed to board the plane cos of my first name (a space was missing), so i called travelgenio and the person was quite helpful and told me that it would be alright and that it was the systems settings.Overall i had a good experience with travelgenio (I guess im lucky(?))."
"Had a very bad experience with Travelgenio.Two days (!) before the trip they informed me that the return flight was cancelled. I insisted they find an alternative, but they only offered a full refund.Finally I myself called the Airlines to find out that the flight wasn't cancelled, but my ticket was (human or systemic mistake). The airlines reconfirmed the return flight within a few hours.Travelgenio was too lazy to move a finger. Never again."
I do not recommend booking tickets via Travelgenio.Their customer service is very poor. The flight I have booked via Travelgenio has been cancelled and they are refusing to refund the price I have paid for the ticket. The customer service employees (I have spoken to 4 different ones by now) said that they cannot disclose the terms and conditions to me on which they base their refusal.
"skyscanner.com is normal to check cheap ticket but travelgenio is I guess cheating the people.My friend tried to buy ticket via sky scanner->travelgenio when he tried to buy the ticket total around 3000$. His credit card limit was not sufficient. In this case transaction suppose to decline but travelgenio deducted 300$ from the credit card after insufficient balance of 3000$. When my friend tried to cancel the booking than they said he needs to pay 30euro for each person and they send a link to pay the balance amount. Than we said ok let's pay the balance. We paid the balance amount and ticket has come. One day after from travelgenio we received another email indicating that we didn't make the payment on given time(but normally with in 24 for hours it was telling and we paid with in 12 hours.) and we need to pay another 130euro other wise they said they are going to cancel the ticket. We called and as above everybody telling the call centre is horrible. We sent couple of email telling that we paid the ticket on time. But first they said we didn't buy the ticket on time and our booking cancelled and they made new booking. We asked proof for that but they didn't give. Later email they said we paid the balance amount late due to that air fare changed and we need to pay the difference.But as i said we paid within the given time. Later we didn't pay the money and they cancelled the ticket and cut 30euro for each ticket and paid the balance back. First issue is illegally they charged less amount and they made you to pay the full amount and after that asked more money. After my calculation the cheap ticket became same or little more than the other websites offers. Another issue:After cancelling ticket we said ok let us take ticket again from travelgenio.Small Note: travelgenio price is almost 100$ less than all other website and even from flight company as well. This was question , how they do this?We have entered all the details for all the passengers. Ticket for one passenger was showing 550$ but in all other websites 650$.At the time of payment it was asking to choose the credit card type. When I choose master card than price became 650$ per person. I tried visa debit card option and it was showing it is 550$. I deposit money to my account to make the payment and i did booking again and the time of payment now it was showing maestro card holders can get in 550 others 650$ , one day before it was showing american express card having the 550$ option. They are playing puzzle with you and wrongly when you do payment in cheap rate than they are telling you to make the difference other wise they cancel your ticket with 30euro penalty. At any cost travelgenio is getting his money and we are loosing. Even now we don't know if we buy the ticket from them , they may send and email to make the extra payment due to rate changes. I suggest everybody to be careful while buying ticket from this cheaters. When you say them I will give you court, they are telling most welcome. So they know nobody will do that or they will not get any punishment from this.So I suggest keep distance with this cheaters...Mehmet Gul-India"
"TRAVELGENIO - never ever! the hidden commission on my flight with Qatar Airlines was 40 euros! Even though I checked evey step thoroughly and unticked all insurances, etc.! They didn't even answer my complaint!"
"NEVER AGAIN TRAVELGENIO!I had the worst experience after using their website to book my flights. They do not have instant check-out/booking facility. When you enter your credit card details, they don't issue the ticket immediately but they take the money from your account anyway! So what happened to me is that because I booked last minute, the original fare went up in a matter of hours and after Travelgenio charged the flight to my card, they sent me an email saying that the airline had cancelled my reservation because the payment was too late so now I had to pay an extra 19 euros for the fare difference. They offered to refund if I didn't want to go through but after researching all the negative reviews about Travelgenio I became extremely worried that I will never get my money back so I had no choice but to pay the extra 19 euros. I was frustrated that in the end I paid more than if I had booked directly with the airline! It was a deceiving trick because on skyscanner they show up as the cheapest fare, but when you book they charge in euros (my account is in USD) and ask for more money after they had already taken it. Be careful what you see on skyscanner!I called their madrid office several times confirming if they got my money or not. I asked them to call me on my phone but they never did so be prepared to spend a lot of money on overseas calls if you are not based in Spain!So after everything was booked and paid for they sent me my itinerary. Two days later, they send another email saying that my return flight had been changed and I was now to leave from a different airport in Istanbul. I printed out the new itinerary and showed it on check-in at IST airport and the staff told me they cannot find my ticket in the system! I was very vaguely told to go to the Ticket/Sales counter of Turkish Airlines to get my new ticket. I was shuffled to different counters, running from one end to the other because the lines at ticketing were so long and extremely worried and stressed that I will miss my flight since they won't let me check in! The ticketing staff insisted that my reservation had been changed but my ticket was not and that the ticket Travelgenio gave me still showed that I was supposed to leave from SAW airport not IST, so I had to pay for a NEW ticket so I can leave from IST! I was completely adamant at this point and argued my best not to pay for it as it was not my fault that the flight had changed and finally succeeded. I was able to check in for my flight with one hour to spare. If I had come to the airport later I probably would have missed my flight so I guess I was lucky. I was so stressed and tired from this ordeal I did not contact Travelgenio until after a few days after my trip. I sent them my complaint but no reply at all. Completely heartless and INCOMPETENT money-sucking booking website. Be warned!"
"I just went through a horrible exterience with travelgenio that turned my Christmas into a nightmare. I booked my tickets in May to have a better prices. When I arrived to the airport, I was told that the airline stopped to fly to my first destination (first leg- flight with change) 3 months ago and so the stupid Travelgenio has 3 months to inform me about that and they didn't. I spent hours on the phone, being put on hold - now my bill for the phone, only for that is 100 EUR and it was useless. They blamed the airline, when the airline said that they were informed about the changes in the flight on the current basis. Finally I was told that I can apply for the refund and left on my own, just before Christmas, when prices were crazy and everything overbooked. And I did not get the total refund for my ticket - only the airline refund me a bit. Since that time - NEVER ANY AGENCIES. I will only book directly by the airline. And I advise everyone the same."
"Now they only ignore my e-mails and when you call them they put you in hold for a long time and transfer from one person to the other and finally you get disconnected. Money suckers - nothing more. If you want to get screwed and turn your trip into a nightmare, this is the way!!! I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN, NOR ANY SIMILAR AGENCY. Only direct booking via the airline!"
I'm sorry that you had to learn the hard way that it is better to book direct and not go chasing what appear to be cheaper fares through third parties.
"> We had such a bad experience with this company that we thought it might be an idea to reactivate this thread. Without going into great detail, their web system failed to operate for verification of our credit card details and, as others have pointed out, their help line – when you get through the complicated system of reaching them, also failed to operate. Numerous emails were exchanged none of which addressed the issues at hand and all of which were in very poor English (which I only expect if a company says it is ‘international’). They claimed that they tried to phone us and couldn’t reach us – this was difficult to challenge until one of the phone numbers we gave them was a very large hotel we were staying in – they could prove that there was no record of the call! But, try telling them that. It is annoying that these companies are so inaccessible and seem to work by firing back a series of useless emails until there is no point continuing. Is there any way to make them accountable?"
"Well, what I can tell is that I was fooled by Travelgenio, this website has ""hiden fees"" that they like to call special discount, usually you get the discount if you have a special card for payment (god knows were you can get this card), any other option will give you a ticket price that sometime is 50% more then the one shown by the searching engine.Anyway, I just think that it is a misleading and dishonest way to make some extra profit."
"DO NOT TRUST TRAVELGENIOMy credit card was denied, since I was over the limit - so I coudln't afford to buy plane tickets. Everything OK at first, but they tried to get my money once again 1 hour later. Since it did not work again, they divided payment in 2 parts (but not at first!)- 'plane tickets' + 'fees for Travelgenio'. So Travelgenio charged me 71€ fees anyway, even I did not confirmed my booking and did not pay for the plane tickets. I also haven't received information from them why they charged me 71€ - so I immendiately canceled my credit card due to possible scam, what is additonal cost for me.Now they will refund me just 41€, but wont refund me 30€ due to their administrative fees. This is not reasonable, since I never confirmed my booking. I also never confirmed 71€ payment.I would not advice to buy tickets from this company! I would not trust them!Very unfair bussines ethics!"
"Hello Anja;You will find information on our web page regarding the most frequent reasons for rejection of some means of payment.If you have problems paying for your booking, contact us at customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will assist you.Best regards."
"NEVER use travelgenio. I bought a flexi ticket, but they did not accept the terms that they advertised. Their customer service is very rude and unhelpful. Best to stick companies that have ABTA recognition or something similar to show that they are legimate."
Hello SimonWe are sorry to read your comment.We will try to assist you about your flex ticket at customer.service@travelgenio.com as soon as possible.Best regards.
"I have contacted customer services many times. The problem is that I bought the flexi option because your web site said that I could change return date without penalty fees or administration fees. When I contacted them they said that there were hidden conditions that meant that I needed to pay both penalty fees and administration fees. I showed screen shots of the conditions I purchased, but to no avail. I still didn't get what I paid for. I recommend other people not to use TravelGenio because I have found that it isn't a trustworthy company."

"i used airtickets.com to book an internal flight in Japan. I needed to change my flight to a day earlier and for 3 weeks prior to the flight after dozens of calls and emails, they were not able to connect me to the airline nor able to change the ticket as their system did not have the capabilities. When I called the airline myself (who were very helpful), they could not do anything about it as air tickets booked the flight through some other arbitrary airline via a code share???? Seriously, i do not think they could be any more useless if they tried. Stay far away - not even a week in the maldives could undo the stress they cause. RUN"
"I was about to book a return flight to Iceland from Greece with Lufthansa, so I used momondo to see the rates.Although I found other cheaper bookers and Lufthansa site was not able to give me a roundtrip some how (???) , I fully booked my tickets from airtickets. I was nervous until few minutes later I received the booking confirmation and checked also on Lufthansa site that the booking was valid.Until now I have booked 2 round trips to Qatar, 1 to Switzerland, 1 to Sweden 1 to Hungary and lot of domestic flights in Greece without any single problem. And now, one more for Iceland.Airticket is recommended by me so far, but you never know in the future.I have to mention that so far it was no needed to change any flight or use the customer care, so I am not the right person to review it."

"Learned the hard way that Travelgenio / Travel2be are basically a scam and I'll never do business with them again. I unlike some others above actually had my flights booked correctly by them. But the very first leg of a trip from Perth to Berlin on 6 May last year was cancelled by the airline. I managed to get to Singapore by other means and got all remaining flights on the booking. Problem is Jetstar Asia refunded to Travelgenio, not me (on 14 May). Travelgenio have used every excuse and delaying tactic in the book to try and avoid paying the refund, including claiming British Airways has the money (!). Their customer service is beyond useless. I'm unfortunately having to file a complaint with the Spanish regulator and am getting advice from former Travelgenio customers who got their money back by taking legal action. It shouldn't have to be like this. They unfortunately impact on the reputation of all online travel firms when they do things like this.Edited: 4 years ago "

"Travelgenio is a scam! DO NOT USE THEM! I paid extra & purchased a flexi ticket - 3 weeks before my travel date I tried to change my flight times. I emailed customer service with my request - they wanted charge me an extra $1120. AUD, saying that the flights I requested were that much more expensive. I sent them a screen shot that showed the flights I wanted were only $20.AUD, extra. They told me the only option I had was to contact the airline, so I did, the airline altered my flight for a total of $170AUD. Thankyou Virgin Australia!!!When I was trying to negotiate my request with Travelgenio it would take them 2 hours to respond to my emails and even then they would not answer my questions. Save yourself the hassle and do not use Travelgenio. Does anyone know if there is a place that I can report Travelgenio so that other people do not get caught?"

"I booked a ticket for Swiss flight from GOT to ZUR. Now there are two different economy classes nowadays on Swiss, Economy Light and Economy Classic. The price difference for this flight was 40€. But the difference is among other things that ski equipment is free on Economy Classic and not on Economy Light! A little matter of paying 100€ or getting the ski baggage for free!!!No information what so ever was given of this in Travelgenio's web-booking, the class is given as ""Tourist"". I think this is definitely wrong and that it should be clear what class the ticket is valid for.I tried to get a change from Economy Light to Classic, for a fee of course. But got the short answer that this was not possible."

You've already got your own thread on Travelgenio Rachel - and you've already had a couple more posts removed by the TA community. Why post it again as it is likely that it will be removed again.
"Dear Rachel, yesterday we sent you the mails of the new itinerary. There was a schedule change operated by the airline and we gave you the alternatives they sent us. The refund was not a possibility as it was just a two hours delay. You received your tickets and everything is confirmed. Hope you and your relatives have a great trip. Regards"
"Hi Martins S, refunds follow the airlines policy and times and can be delayed more than we would like. Send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the status and contact you back. Thanks in advance"
"It seems that TRAVELGENIO staff checks this website every day, but it is very difficult for them to refund the money. They don't respect the law and their clients at all! I wait back my money already 4 months!!!!"
Please send us all the booking info to the mail customer.service@travelgenio.com Martins S. We will check the status and contact the airline to know what happened.
"I bought the flight tickets directly from TRAVELGENIO, not from the air company. Lawyer said that it's TRAVELGENIO responsibility to refund my money!I wrote many e-mails every week and wait already 4 months for reimbursement and nothing happens!!"
Is it possible to change my Surname? because i mistakenly wrote wrong detail when i booked a ticket with Travelgenio
"DO NOT book with travelgenio.As said in other messages, once you make the reservation, they send you a message that they will confirm within 24hrs but they actually send you an email saying the payment cannot be processed though they still take your money, like 30USD while you get nothing.Just don't use this scam!"
"Hi Azar, of course we can help you with your name changes. Airlines have different policies for these changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking information and the changes you need to make and we will ask the air company if it is possible and if there is an extra fee.Regards"

"I also just booked tickets from Melbourne to Vanuatu with Travelgenio - same deal; no credit card denial, e-tickets were emailed within half an hour - I checked with Virgin that everything was ok which is was and in the process saved myself AUD235.00. Looks to me that if you cancel or change flights that issues arise."
"DONT USE TRAVELGENIO!! They are really a bad website, I will NEVER AGAIN buy from them. I had a bad experience today as they were misleading on their site and did not indicate that the tickets i bought were without baggage allowance. so i had to purchase baggage through the airlines myself because, TRAVELGENIO charges a service fee when they do it for me. Can you believe this? They are really scum!"

She is rude, unprofessional and useless. Then since February 24. 2016 I wrote 31 e-mails and finally today I got reply. Stating they made a mistake but can not fix the problem and I am stuck with this useless ticket. They admit making the mistake but now it is my problem. Unbelievable but true. Be careful using this Agency. Best stay away from them."

Stay away from Travelgenio. They are the greatest rop off artists in the industry.My experience with Skyscanner is very positive and I used them a few times
Sent you all of the details in more than 30 e mails.Booking code FYI Z49S9NNow that I inform the public about the rotten serviceFrom your company you want more e mails.Fix the problem or I will never stop to advise the whole world about this matter
"""Fix the problem or I will never stop to advise the whole world about this matter""I have read some hollow threats on this forum, but this must be close to the weakest."
No Hollow Threat. So far 7 Forums have published my complaint. That is just today and it is just the beginning.
"Dear Albert, we are checking your case and one of our agents will contact you with all the information. Regards"
What information? You need to fix the problem. Your reply is meaningless. Options you have: cancel ticket and provide full refund or cancel your euro 42 service fee and pay for the luggage charge euro 30.
"<No Hollow Threat. So far 7 Forums have published my complaint.

This thread itself has 300+ warning posts - and there are thousands of others on other TripAdvisor threads/forums. What prevented you from doing research to view these posts, left for you, before you booked and sent your money?? Apparently advising the world not to use them, didn't work for the posters who warned you?"
That was my mistake. In future I will check on Tripadvisor. Lesson learned but that does not mean that I will not pursue this issue till it is solved to my satisfaction

"""That was my mistake.""___Not your only mistake. Publishing your booking reference in a public forum is also a mistake too."
Nothing secret about a booking code of a flight I will not take because it is not what I booked
"It's still your booking code. You're revealing it in a public domain, which along with other information which may be gleaned from you means others could access your booking. But, if you feel comfortable revealing it then that's entirely up to you."
"Pursue your complaint by all means, but you should also realise that an internet campaign like the one you are speaking of will almost certainly not achieve anything at all."
"thankfully I read your messages regarding Travelgenio. I was about to pay, when I've noticed that they want to charge the credit card transaction fee of $39.50 twice. I mean they stated that the fee is $39.50, but in the actual list of charges $79 appeared. There is only one airline involved in my trip, though change of planes. Wow, some creative accounting there.Update:I've just purchased the same trip from Finnair directly for $43 dollars more ... but no credit charges, so it was actually cheaper at the end. AND! the feeling you get when you receive the airline's free SMS confirmation immediately after making the payment ... priceless!Edited: 4 years ago "

"@heinzalbertWith all my respect, this is not travelgenio but a public forum.Please do not start spamming.You shared your negative experience like a few hundreds before you on this thread alone.To solve your problem you have to deal with travelgenio. Good luck and all the best."
"don't use travelgenio, terrible services, and it's a fraud it's also linked with travel2be. Best to check out your bankcard insurance as if any problems your bank can cover the cost of the lost money. But show the proof of whats happen. ok"
"That entire list of 3rd party sites give me chillsGood luck to all,Hunt"
Received fraud alert from my bank......have NO idea how they got into my account for over a 100 dollars.
FRAUD ALERT for my bank for unknown charges from them....stay away
"And how did 'they' get your CC numbers? If you have never dealt with an on-line ticket flogger recently, it could only be that someone else has details of your card and has tried to book with it."
"Dear Jean, please send us all the charges details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check them. Regards"
"We have also made the HUGE mistake of booking through TRAVELGENIO. They changed our flights over 20x and all of them have had the connection flight in the past (so we could never actually catch it). We have been on the phone with them for hours and hours and the lady we spoke to was SO rude! She also hung up on me because she just didn't want to deal with our situation anymore. They have also changed my partners name so its now incorrect, they refused to correct it and said it will be ok, but my name is also wrong and they suggested i should get a refund and re book! They are money grabbing robbers who will make your trip hellish before you have even started! DONT BOOK THROUGH TRAVELGENIO"
"Hi Saltyhairsandytoes, of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans.Regards"
BEWARE: AIRTICKETS.COM - do NOT book with them! Worst customer service. I have been waiting for a change to a booking for 7 days. It's only a name change and still nothing has been done. They have not replied to any emails sent via their website or directly to them.I have had to call their support line 3 times to follow up and each time I have been told someone will get back to me but nothing still!I have used many different sites to make booking and the customer service for this one has been the worst! I will never use them ever again!!!
"This website ruined our vacation. Me and my friend booked a roundtrip to Mexico and were very happy at first when we got the cheap tickets. Two weeks after we transferred the money we got an email from travelgenio to transfer the money again because they did not get it. I double checked it and also asked my bank and they said that travelgenio must have gotten it. I told travelgenio about it and they gave me two options: to either transfer the money again or send them an formal letter from my bank. I of course send them the letter because why should I pay twice?! I thought everything was fine now and we actually were able to fly to Mexico. Then I got an email two days before we were supposed to fly back. They wanted me to pay again durning the next 6 hours or they would be cancelling the flight. Because of the time difference to travelgenios office in Spain, I was not even able to transfer the money again, even tho I would not have done it anyways. The result is, they cancelled our flight right away. I was in total panic and had the worst trip afterwards because I was stressed 24/7. We booked the flight back directly over an airline this time and had to pay a huge amount for the last minute flight back. At the moment we are trying to take proceeding against them but this is going to be difficult because their office is in Spain.So everyone, do not ever use travelgenio, no matter how cheap it is."
"Marjolein K, if only there were a website out there where people could research reviews on companies like these."

"Hi Matej,I used Skyscanner on several occasions and it wad satisfactory. That is until I came accross Travelgenio and purchased an additional flexi ticket option. Common sense makes it clear that people use a flexi option to amend either outbound or inbound flight date. In my case I need to change an inbound flight but Travelgenio agents tell me that it cannot be done for partly used tickets. In other words you have to make all changes to the ticket BEFORE you travel. The question then is why would you need a flexi option? My opinion is Travelgenio is a scam."
"Dear All,I just booked yesterday a flight from Paris to Taipei with TRAVEL2BE within the TRAVELGENIO group (the client service signature clearly mentions the 2 companies).However, I did not receive any confirmations 24 hours after my reservation, so I called this morning the client service. They told me that my flight has been cancelled by the airline company. Consequently, I asked for a total refund of the amount (642.32€)I have a confirmation by telephone and by email from the Client Service that the amount will be refund in the following days (she said certainly on Monday 11 April 2016).I will certainly let you know the second part of the story...Best regards,Frédéric"
Have you checked on the airline website to see if the flight has actually been cancelled?
Hi Frederic;We can help you with your booking confirmation.Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards
"Dear Frommy,Thank to you advice, I just checked on the airline company. website and the flight is actually available.There is a gap of information between TRAVEL2BE client service over the phone and the airline company website :http://fr.ceair.com/MU8662Departure date : 8april2016Dear Travelgenio,I forwarded you my email exchange with the client service of TRAVEL2BE which is the same as yours, as the signature mentions both companies : TRAVEL2BE and TRAVELGENIO.Therefore, I am waiting for the total refund of the amount.Thank you for your help."
"Hi Frederic, we have received your mail and one of our agents will contact you asap to give you all the info about the refund you mention. Regards"
"""There is a gap of information""That is a polite way of saying that you have been fed a load of b*llshlt. The fare that you thought you were buying was probably never available in the first place so they told you the flight had been cancelled.Edited: 4 years ago "
"If my experience may help a future customer, I will keep you updated regarding any feedback from TRAVEL2BE, TRAVELGENIO and my bank account transactions (debit or credit) on this purpose."
"I have been refunded by TRAVEL2BE with no extra fees.After posting on tripadvisor, my request had been escalated to ""urgent request"" by the client service.Everything is ok on my side, more fright than real harm."
"Dear Matej,I can only strongly advise you not to book with Travelgenio!! It is the worst customer experience I ever had!! I tried to arrange a change in my return flight from China to Germany after my initial flight was cancelled and I was automatically booked on a flight 3 days later without any notice!! It took me already 6 calls to their customer service to try get a flight back on the same day. The call agents constantly are sending wrong information to airline (china air), which is why I am not moving an inch towards having my flights secured. On top of it, the call agents simply want to cut you off without having solved your problem (not to mention, that they Spanish with very limited command in English). I had problems with Travelgenio already last year, which ended with having to involve a law firm. It is a truly nightmare experience!!! I wish they would go bankrupt.hope it helps you to make the right decision, Vitaly"

"I booked 2 flights with Travelgenio that were cancelled because the airline cancelled the routes. I spoke with the airline and they told me I had alternative flights available to choose from in my travel agency, without any extra charge. So I contacted Travelgenio to choose from one of them, and after 2 hours and 30 minutes of 3 different calls, I had to speak Portuguese, Spanish and English to get an alternative flight. In each call I had to explain everything from the beginning, and I was provided with a different excuse. Then I would call back the airline, who didn't understand what was the big deal with selecting the alternative. At the end of the last call, I had my flights booked.Until 1 month later, I receive an email telling me the original flight was cancelled, and that I could ask for a full refund. I was tired of this, and asked for the refund, but I'm still waiting for an answer..."
"HI Pedro Miguel, we feel sorry for all these misunderstood. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our team will contact you to solve your involuntary changes and refund. Regards"
"I suggest you do not book with TravelGenio at all or read their Terms and Conditions very, very carefully and print them out in case you have to use them. However, I am in doubt that you will be able to use them in your defence as hey would probably have some new ones... In my case I bought a flexi ticket bearing in mind that I might change a return date. It appeared that TravelGenio would only change dates Before the trip has started. It does not make much sense to me because the whole idea of a flexi ticket is an option to change a return date after you actually set off for the journey. You would not avail of a flexi option if you know your return date in advance.They did not refund me any money; they re-directed me to their Terms and Conditions and suggested I read them more carefully. So watch out!"
"Hi Tatiana, as it appears in the flex ticket conditions, changes can be made before the ticket departure date as the ticket means both journeys. We feel sorry if there was a misunderstood. Anyway, you can contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com if you want us to check your case in detail. Regards"
"For a mistake on their webisite my booking was not correct...Well: Very low quality customer service, the operator was just keep saying the same thing and then hung up on me. Obivously you pay a lot even for calling... Better to spend 10 extra euro but you deal directly with the air company..."
Hello Giovanni;Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards
thanks all i almost got ripped off
"Travelgenio is a TOTAL SCAM!I just booked a flight from Skyscanner which directed me to Travelgenio which had the lowest price.The starting price was 826 Euros, but somehow I got charged with 877 Euros without selecting any extra options, just the basic ticket without any extra services. I wouldn't recommend it, and if you are going through Skyscanner then select tripsta because I took a flight with them and didn't have surprises"
"""select tripsta""Bye, bye frypan. Fire here I come."
"Hi Pierre, we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Warning - never ever use Travelgenio.com to book any airline tickets. I had my BOS-Peru (South America) flight tickets booked well in 2 months advance but due to some unfortunate circumstance in my family I could not make it to the trip and informed the airlines and Travelgenio customer service ahead of time, even though the airlines was offering a refund or a travel voucher for later use, Travelgenio refused and only replied after the date of the trip. They have the worst customer service ever, no US number and email response time is pathetic. Please spend some extra bucks and book it through a trusted travel agent and get some peace of mind. TRAVELGENIO has been the worst experience ever."
That would have been Travelgenio adding their T&C's which you would have agreed to at the time of booking. Hardly unfair if you agreed to it.
"Hi Parul417, of course we can help you with your booking schedule changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking reference and the changes you want to make and we will inform you about the changes possibilities of your ticket rate and, if they are allowed, the conditions for the changes. Regards"
That is an absolute untruth!I have received a reply to my email following this post which just stated that if I want to add baggage I can pay a fee to Travelgenio to change the booking then I can pay for the luggage. A total of 45 euro to add a suitcase - per person! I am also waiting for a reply to a separate email asking to send through a tax invoice. This was sent on the 4th May.
They are definitely not the cheapest once they add in all the unavoidable costs - like not accepting your mastercard so you're forced to pay with another card - with another cost. Should have realised that their alert that there were only 9 seats left was a scam.
"Dear AP0804, could you please tell us your booking code? We will check your case once more and see the tax invoice status. Regards"
"Stay away from travelgenio. I clicked on the flight, it opened a new tab and the price was higher. Then I clicked on the flight again. This time price increased more then I used the incognito mode and price dropped.I gave all my credit card information and clicked purchase then I recieved a notification saying ""The price increased 200 more in last two minutes. Do I still want to book this flight?""I am checking my transactions since then. Don't trust travelgenio."
"Hi Gokce y, our searcher is directly connected to the airline, the only one that can change the tickets prices. We would like to know more about what happened to the flight you chose. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will contact you with all the info, regards"
"Hey, I would strongly recommend you to book through the airlines website. We booked with TRAVEL GENIO and caused us so many problems for the 3 months leading up to our journey. 1. Changing flight schedules which mean the connecting flight was in the past.2. Changed my partner name to an incorrect name and then threatened that he couldn't fly with one letter wrong.3 Took 1hour on average to call them where they cannot communicate with you and are really rude then hang up! Anyway I hope you manage to find a good booking website but I would strongly recommend paying a little extra and be safe with the airline your flying with. Safe travels xEdited: 4 years ago "
"Hi Saltyhairsandytoes, we feel sorry for what we read. We cannot change the flight schedules, it is the airline the only one that can make those type of changes or cancellations according to the flight plan. About the name, we make the emmissions according to the info introduced during the booking process, as we don't make them manually. We will check it anyway to tell you how to proceed if you need to change it. Please send us all your booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will contact you. Regards"
"""we make the *emmissions* according to the info introduced""Wiki ""Emission of air pollutants, notably: Flue gas, gas exiting to the atmosphere via a flue. Exhaust gas, flue gas generated by fuel combustion.""So what you put out seems to me to be a lot of methane from the nether regions."
Sorry for the word used. We wanted to say that we cannot change nothing. Please send us the mail with the info. Regards
"we had a very bad experience with travelgenio.com as well.wanted to change the flight and their price was twice as much as original booking due to their high administration cost. This is a company of poor service and lack of care, would not recommend them to anybody."
"Hi Grazyn, we would like to know more about the changes you asked us for in your booking. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will be more than pleased to check it and contact you. Regards"
"Thanks to all the commenters here. Judging by the reviews, I will avoid third party sites and go direct with the airlines. Rather pay extra than get cheated!Edited: 4 years ago "
"<<Rather pay extra than get cheated!>> In most cases the reality is that you are actually pay less if you book directly with the airline. But this can only be judged once all the charges are in and the flight is over.Anyway, booking directly with the airline can avoid many problems."
"Even when a third party site does offer a genuinely cheaper fare than an airline, it's more than likely that over the medium to long term, you'll end up paying more through the agent. This is because at some point you'll probably need to rack up a phone bill getting something sorted out, or you'll fall foul of added fees and charges somewhere along the way. Or you'll simply pay a little more for flights than you need to without even realising it if you just get into the habit of using one particular agent without doing full price comparisons each time."
"DO NOT. I REPEAT. DO NOT BOOK YOUR TICKETS from TRAVELGENIO.com (Travel2be.com)I was lured into buying the cheapest ticket from skyscanner from Travel2be website. Once I was at the payment gateway, the amount was Rs 34080.27. At the time of payment however, as soon as I entered my card details, the amount shot up to 37,373. I got no OTP for this transaction and even though I stopped the payment midway, it got processed (blame my internet speed or just their good luck).As soon as I saw that the booking is being processed, I wrote to them to cancel the booking as it was still under process and not confirmed. I however got an automated reply from TRAVELGENIE.com instead. I still have a screenshot that I wrote to Travel2be but instead in my email, I got a reply from travelgenie.I called them up before the booking was confirmed. The man on the line literally made me wait for 15 mins. All he said each time was you would have to pay a penalty of 158 euros. Each time. Even though I told him I did not want this booking to get through, that it was still under process. Meanwhile I got a confirmation for my booking. He still kept me on hold asking me to wait. When I cancelled that call and called back in order to speak to someone more knowledgable, I was made to wait for 20 mins but none of their representatives picked up the call.ABsolutely disgusted with the customer service. Will never ever opt for them again!Edited: 4 years ago "
And absolutely did no research into who you were throwing your money at as well. Plenty of warnings if you had bothered to look. And you were not lured to book- you made a choice to click on the cheapest option of the ADVERTISED prices by third parties shown on SkyScannerEdited: 4 years ago 
"Hi Pahal, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the charges and the cancellation policy for the ticket you selected and contact you back. Regards"
"""I was lured into buying the cheapest ticket from skyscanner from Travel2be website.""-----------------------------No, no, you were not lured to book from skyscanner, skyscanner is just a search engine, actually, you were lured by the price, the cheapest price, and did not do a research yourself before giving money to them."
"You made the decision to go for what appeared to be the cheapest price returned by a search engine, Pahal. You were not lured or directed to go there."
"Hi, but where you actually able to board that flight? or where you basically scammed? I'm so worried"
Scam website! Very bad experience! they charges more than $30 into my credit card even when the air ticket booking is unsuccessful. Please avoid using this website
"HI THL888, sometimes, when you start the booking procces, although the reservation is not charged in complete because of the credit card limits, the administration fees can be charged because its amount. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the charges made and your case. Regards"
"I have been dealing with Travelgenio for two weeks and it is by far the worst customer service I have experienced. Firstly, as many others before me, I followed the links through skyscanner (with the correct dates) and somewhere along the way my dates were changed (never mind the price increase, additional costs etc). I admit at some point I probably agreed to this incorrect date. Let it be known I have NEVER booked incorrect flights, and the date I needed to book is a holiday here so there's no reason I would forget/mistaken it. I called Travelgenio twice and both times was on hold on their answer machine over 35mins.I was eventually offered to change my flights (for a fee higher that the airline fee) but when i questioned the dates I was suggested to send an email - which I did, with csreen shots of my sky scanner alerts with correct dates and web history showing I went from mail --> scanner --> Travelgenio to which I received no response. I sent two more emails and still no response so called again a week later. I called again, of course on hold, of course price changes went up and still extremely unhelpful.I asked to speak to a manager but apparently there is none. I was suggested to write to their 'complaints' centre who for 3 emails could only COPY/PASTE their ""apologies for my inconvenience"". To top it off, after I paid an extortionate amount to change my return flight (123 Euro!) they never emailed me my updated tickets or confirmation as promised and I had to write in again. I suggest you use this site at your own risk, and if you do end up needing to call/email do not expect any response."

"Travelgenio, if you had even bothered to read the message below (or check my records and the 6emails I sent) you would have realised1- I've already made the change (at an extortionate price and terrible experience)2- I'm only pointing out how unacceptable the level of customer service is - a point which you have brilliantly just proven!"

"HelloI booked a ticket with Travelgenio about 2 months ago and there were challenges with payment via card, hence booking did not go through, so i never got the ticket.Despite that, Travelgenio charged me for a reservation that was never done; i contacted them and each time they needed one month to answer my questions (so not client oriented).The started to answer after i said i'll make more complaints and write on forums.The feedback i got from them was that I cancelled my reservation (which i did not do) and that is why i was charged.Very bad experience!"
I fully agree with Point 2..i have been experiencing the same!

I confirm - will neve use them again
"Very bad experience with Travelgenio.... I had to cancel my trip and Travelgenio tried to tell me I couldn't get my money back or a credit, I rang Virigin airlines direct who the flight was with and they advised me that I could get a credit or refund on my flight. Travelgenio said that they would give me a credit. I have been trying to use my credit within the so called expiry date to use my credit. I am calling and writing few times a week however they do not respond to the written messages and when I call they give always hang up on me. It's never possible to talk to supervisor or complain as it arrives to the same people who do not reply. I have even followed their complaints process with no response.Please be careful with this shameful company - TRAVELGENIO... I would strongly suggest you book your fligths with another company.

"Or you book the incorrect airport and neglect to reconfirm anything until day or travel (your mistake, as you've admitted) ... right GRmary06?"
Travelgenio ruined my travel plans. I am shocked and infuriated at the lack of helpfulness and options with regards to changing and adjusting my booking. I spoke with two people over a span of three days because there was an entire day when NO ONE picked up and I was on hold for up to 30 minutes at a time. Having made multiple phone calls each time being put on hold I finally got through to someone on the third day and was informed that the price of changing my ticket would be more than 3 times the original price of the ticket and then when I asked for an extra leg to be added to the existing booking I was rudely told that this is not at all possible and that the agent can look at flights for me but it would be extremely expensive if he booked it and it told me to go look by myself.Edited: 4 years ago

"Hi Jimmy, please send us all the info regarding your cancellation petition to customer.service@travelgenio.com to check it in detail. Best regards"
"Travelgenio is a scam. Do not ever use them no matter what the cost.They are rude, dishonest and fraudulent.I was instructed by Travelgenio to cancel my ticket due to unforeseen changes at a cancellation fee of $136 Euro. However I am still owed $1257 and receiving no help or assistance from Travelgenio to have this money reimbursed. When I called (which is very difficult and you have to wait a very long time) I was told ""know one can help you"".Please never use Travelgenio no matter how cheap the airfare."
"Hi, could you please tell us your booking code to see the charges and all the info? We would like to contact you with all the details. Regards"
"Yes, it is better go to the court immediately, I will never buy any plane tickets in this company!"
"I've just booked a ticket through Travelgenio and am already not happy with them. They trick you into thinking your ticket is cheaper than it actually is. When I got to 'pay now' I saw that the reason why it was cheaper was because they give you a discount of 39.99 when paying with a debit card. Great, because I have two of them, but neither of them worked. So I called their call center where a very bored, not costumer-service minded person explained to me that that doesn't always work, so I had to select the 'pay with credit card' option, which would charge me the 39.99. No patient explanation, no apologies. So they let you believe that you're getting a cheaper price, then once you're in, they make you pay the full price anyway by making the website in such a way that paying (the cheaper fare) with a debit card doesn't work. It is that I really needed that get this ticket, otherwise I would have definitely gone with a different website. I don't like this' tricking people into things' way."
"Hi Mlissa, we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"TRAVELGENIO - FRAUD! Beware!While booking my flight tickets through travelgenio I kept seeing the same price of 803 USD. I was very conscious about unchecking all additional service fees, so the final amount remained the same. Before the checkout I went through the flight/payment information again, the amount was still 803. After paying I saw that my card was charged 837 USD. When I called the company, a person on the phone told me that was some service fee for paying with Visa and then offered two options: I either cancel my booking with paying 35 USD (!) service fee, or we just leave it as it is. That is absolutely inappropriate - the company advertises low prices and then charges you whatever it wants."
"Hi Dimsmile, There are some discounts only available for a credit card (something shown in the first screen), if the payment is made with other, the discount is not effective. Send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check it. Regards"
"My experience with Travelgenio is even worse - I made booking today with them (first and last time), they confirmed it and they charged my Visa (it was shown in Pending transaction section). An hour later they sent me an e-mail, telling me that they want to verify again my payment and asked me to PAY AGAIN for the same ticket. I called them and somebody with a heavy African accent started pushing me in giving my Visa card number again. It is a scam, stay away."
"Hi Silvers, we feel sorry for what we read. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the charges done and why you are asked for all the info once more. Regards"
Travelgenio is a terrible company to deal with. One of my flights home from Naples was changed so to make it impossible to catch the connection and they refuse to give me a full refund. They aren't even offering me half of what I paid. So now I am out the money from my old flight and paid twice as much to find another way home because this all happened so last minute.I highly reccommend you stay away from them
"Hi Cdeemert, please send us all the details to see the airline options that are available for your involuntary changes operated by the airline. We have to follow the options they give us to solve their changes. Our mail is customer.service@travelgenio.com"
"And your customer reply option does not work as well. You fill it up, click ""Submit"" and it does not go anywhere.My booking is YFXBWC - cancel it, I do not trust you, I am totally against giving you my credit card number, I would recommend DOT to shut down your operation in US - it is a scam, not a business."
We send your request to our team. They will contact you by mail with all the info. Regards
"Please do not use this company. I want to warn everyone out there thinking to book through ‘Travelgenio’ or ‘Travel2be’ to save your self the hassle and go with a more reputable travel company. These guys are criminals and take no responsibility for their actions. They take your money for weeks at a time and leave you in a country with no flight, and then when you finally get in touch with them they make the refund process so hard you nearly give up on it. I was left $370 out of pocket due to their actions but they didn’t want to know anything about it. They just put the blame back on you and after a while you just feel like your going around in circles. Do yourself a favor and book with another company.In short I booked a flight about 6 weeks in advance, I received an email with a booking confirmation and a flight itinerary as well as the amount for the flight being deducted from my bank account so it was pretty safe to say I thought I had a flight. Having organized my flight I went travelling for the next month or so and before needing to catch this flight I checked the flight number to ensure no changes or cancellations had been made which they hadn’t, the flight details still matched the original itinerary that I printed out. So on the day of my flight I arrive at the airport in a foreign country to be told I don’t have a reservation. After showing the attendant my itinerary and booking confirmation he goes out the back for 20 minutes and return with some print out that says I definitely don’t have a ticket. He then proceeds to tell me that instead of the original $350 that I already paid the price of the fair was now $720. As this was only one of a series of connecting flights on my way back home I had no choice but to pay it or risk missing all my other flights.Returning back home I get in contact with Travelgenio to see what had happened and they give me a drawn out explanation basically saying its my fault because I didn’t email them back to confirm my ticket after I booked it. (But they still took my money though? Yes I don’t get it either). So after about a dozen emails I finally get a refund of my original booking because they didn’t actually book anything for me. But that left my $370 out of pocket because of the $720 I had to pay at the airport when I could have got a ticket for $350 originally from multiple companies. But according to them it was all my fault and haven’t compensated any money for my loss. They made the refund process a nightmare having to go back and forth several times and speaking to about 4 different alternating people each day. They tried to lie to me about the refund process saying that it had already been started but when I asked for proof they didn’t get back to me until the next day but said “yes it was started yesterday” I said back to them “so you’ve had my money for 6 weeks and the refund process has only just started now?” Then they just completely ignore the question in their next response.So according to them it was my fault because I didn’t confirm with them yet I received a flight itinerary and a booking confirmation as well as money deducted from my account. I would have thought when they take money from your account that would have been confirmation enough. To put it in perspective I’ve flown about 12 times in the last 4 months while travelling and this is the only problem I’ve had with flying. I’ve booked with varying airlines through different booking agencies and this is the only problem I had when I booked for the first and ONLY time EVER with Travelgenio (or Travel2be, whatever you want to call them). But one thing to call them for sure is nasty. Do not use these guys, there are plenty of other travel agencies out there that do the right thing, these guys do not."

Travelgenio has one of the worst customer service Ive ever experienced in my life. Straight up rude people answering the phone. Also it takes around 15 minutes just for them to answer and they have this incredibly annoying music in the background.
"Hi Sergio, we feel sorry to read this. Could you please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com? We will contact you asap. REgards"
"Would definitely not book an airline ticket through Travelgeno again I have sent them at least seven request emails to change the dates of a future flight that I have booked and paid through them, but have not received any human reply. The last one was 6 days ago but have not received an answer.Would not recommend them to any one"

"Travelgenio have ruined our travel plans. We booked 7 tickets for our family, the money was taken from our bank account and no confirmation has been received. We spoke with their Melbourne office, gave them three different emails and none of these email addresses received the apparent confirmation email. ITS A SCAM!! We have contacted our Bank and will now pursue through lawyers. Shame on sky scanner to for directing people to these scammers."
""" will now pursue through lawyers""Save your money unless you have a friendly lawyer in Spain.""The present terms and conditions are governed in their totality by Spanish Law.""And SkyScanner did not direct you to this shower, you chose to click on a paid advert on the page of SkyScanner search results.Edited: 4 years ago "

"I found a flight through Kayak and when I selected the flight I was automatically transferred to the Travelgenio.com website.I tried to make payment with 3 different credit cards and each time it said the payment was rejected. I know these cards have no problem because I use them all the time without any problem.Finally I tried a 4th Card and I got the message that the payment was accepted.Then next day I received an email from Travelgenio stating that the payment did not go through. Because of the risk of losing the flight, I cancelled the reservation through Travelgenio and made the reservation direct with the airline.Travelgenio then charged me € 5.03 for the pleasure of their non-service.I protested and they replied ""I should have read the small print"".Basically DO NOT BOOK through these people, they are only out to rob you without giving the service.A RIGHT SCAM"

Many days later I got refund and no ""sorry"". My extra cost for their undone work - two taxi rides, few days, one hotel night. Any requests to them do not indicate they understand they have done something wrong. All they say is I can try next time again. No way!"

"Absolutely awful company DO NOT book with this company!!! We booked a flight from Dublin to Cancun. We only relised after we booked the flight that the flight was not going from Dublin to Gatwick but from dublin to london city airpirt then to gatwick with only 3 hours and 40 mins to make an hour and a half journey from london city airport to Gatwaick. This means is the flight from dublin to london city airport is anyway delayed we will miss our flight.We contact B.A and virgin and we were told this is ""absolutely impossible"" to get get our bags and check in again in Gatwick find our gate ect (in one of the worlds biggest airports).We were advised by a costumer service agent be prepared to miss our flight and that we were sold illegal flight. I contacted Trevelgenio and we were told this is possible and there is nothing they can do. So it is our word against their word. I feel like my holiday to Mexico has now been destroyed and a complete vilation of my consumer rights has been made.This company have no interest in consumer service and do not care or want to help.We even said that we would purchase our own flight to Gatwick but if we do this the whole ticket will cancel.So now instead of looking forward to my holiday I am looking into consumer legal action I can take against this company just to have my flight change so that I dont miss it. I was sold a flight that is impossible to make and this was not made clear when making this purchase."
"Dear Shauna, as told by mail, the airport info is shown during the booking process.

"TRAVEL GENIO: 2 months back I tried to book an online Delhi/London ticket through my Indian agency & was taken to a payment window, which I filled. I was then asked for a password of which I had no knowledge. I was locked in that window & so had no choice but to log out. I received no kind of communication from my agency or from the airline regarding the transaction and so proceeded to buy my ticket directly through the airline. Some time later, I was shocked to receive a notification from my credit card company telling me that a company called Travel Genio was charging me for the trip, and asking me whether they should effect the payment. I thanked them and asked them to block the payment.And now this week, I received a series of emails from Travel Genio threatening me with legal action if I didn't pay for my ticket, even telling me that they would send the police after me! I did some research on them and found that I'm not their first victim. I was lucky that my credit card company blocked payment for a ticket that didn't exist."

"I already did that and your solution was a flight 2 days earlier with a 30 hour layover. Maybe if you answered your emails as fast as trying to place comments on this site your customer service impression might improve. Why have you taken money from our account for flights you are not honoring and offering unrealistic options. Please confirm so everyone who reads can be clear that either the original flights will be honored as the airline is still selling seats on that date, we will be given realistic and similar revised options (without 30 hour layovers) or will be given our money back so we can book flights with someone who will honour the commitments they made and took money for"
"Travelgenio has the worst customer service I've ever come across. Although the flights are cheap they are full of stress, confusion and lies. Different people who work there promise different options but do not fulfill them. I am telling this from first hand experience as our flight was not issued and booked because of their bad communications. I urge you not to book your fights with them because they betray you."

Travel2be/travel genio is the worst company i have ever dealt with. I called them to find out about changing a flight and every person i spoke to was extremely rude and hung up on me. They obviously can not be bothered to deal with the thousands of calls they recieve because of their awful service so just hang up on every call without resolving. Absolutely extortionate fees to change - im prepared to pay admin fees and the difference but the charge they proposed was an extra fee of double the price of the original/a new flight - an extra $1000 just to make a change when i can see the flight is much less on their site. Awful people extremely rude on the phone i was told several times they didnt have time to speak to me as there were lots of calls waiting. Obviously lying about charges and prices to mislead the customer. Disgusted in their service and will never deal with them again.
">> an extra $1000 just to make a change when i can see the flight is much less on their site <<change fees are linked to the fare rules of the ticket purchased and are charged by the airlineIt is not uncommon to see a change fee of £300 + fare difference. To avoid paying airline change fees you would need to purchase a fully flexible ticket - these can be generally around 4x the cost of a more restricted ticketIn addition to the fees charged by the airline, your age will charge a fee - from the T&Cs this is €30 per ticketWhilst the customer service issues are no doubt valid, I expect the fees being quoted are linked to the ticket fare rules (with the €30 on top) Making changes to restricted tickets can often be expensive and you may want to check out whether buying a new ticket is cheaper"
"Hi Elsa, we feel sorry if you had a bad experience with our call center. Please send us all the changes requirements you made to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check what happened and contact you with all the info. Regards"
"Hi Carol, if you need to change your dates or cancel a flight we need to follow the ticket and airline penalties and the actualization of the rate if prices are different. All these if the fare accept changes, because some tickets do not allow them. Please send us all the info by mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the possibilities for your petition. Regards"
"Hi All,I used travelgenio to book flight tickets, since they had the cheapest option on skyscanner. However my experience with Travelgenio has been very disappointing and bad. Firstly, while booking their website shows that if you use a Visa Debit card , there is no transaction fee. However , when you use this option, it declines the card. When I used a credit card, the total transaction fee shown was much higher than what was the actual price shown . I called the customer care and tried to explain this to them however they are not helpful at all. Finally, I had to give my debit card details over the phone and they charged me a transaction fee on this despite it being clearly mentioned on the website that there would be no fee. When I asked to cancel the booking, I was told I would be charged $44 for cancellation for no fault of mine. This company is based in Spain, hence now I have no option but to wait for my booking to come through and hope that the booking is legit. I have sadly learnt my lesson and will never use them or recommend this to anyone."
"When you only go by selecting the cheapest advertised fares, and you don't research whoever is selling them, then you'll always run the risk of having a poor experience. It's also very important to look at the T&C's of the contract you'll be entering into, so that you understand the implications of things like cancellations."
"Hi Smitha, we would like to know more about the charges and the problems you had with the credit card during the payment. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will contact you. Regards"
20th July my account deducted with $1226.57 for flights from Bangkok to Madrid.15th August my account credited with $1087.94 for refunding flights that the airline could not honour.$138.63 deducted despite the airline advising a full refund would be given to travel genio.If you are fortunate enough to be reading this review before booking any flights with these scammers do not.Never in my life have I experienced such disgusting service from any company I have dealt with re the many flight bookings I have made in my life.DO NOT BOOK ANY FLIGHTS with this company as they are a total disgrace and scam.I wish I had read all the crap reviews on this site before booking as everyone is correct about this company.

"Yesterday I tried to purchase tickets to Vienna for a weekend. I looked on SkyScanner and with TravelGenio it would cost 88 euros, meanwhile with FlyNikki direct website it was 109 euros. So given the price difference, I chose TravelGenio. The thing is, they sent me two e-mails: one to confirm the reservation. Other to claim the credit card had denied the purchase. So I called the credit card company and they told me the transaction had been cancelled. So far, not a big deal. Later on the day I searched on the Internet and I figured out what their deal is about: 3 days after the purchase they will charge you 40 euros for cancelation tax. And at this moment the transaction will not be denied by the bank. How come? Well, basically because when they charge your credit card at the first transaction, they charge in an invalid currency. But for the 40 euros they use the correct currency, so the credit card accepts it.Edited: 3 years ago "

"Skyscanner is usually fine except booked with Travelgenio along with skyscanner and it was terrible. I booked my flight and was told upon check in that the bag was included, upon booking it didn't state any bag at all so I assumed it was fine but took photos just in case and of course there was no bag included even though it has said prior to booking. I contacted them and was given excuse after excuse, dealing with a number of people and getting the same response even after showing them that they were in the wrong and provided false information. All I wanted was the bag included which they wouldn't do. I always fly and have never had a bad experience but this was poorest customer service (and I use to work in customer service) will not be booking with them ever again or recommending them to anyone."
Hello Tecreator;Thanks for share your comments.If you need support please write to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking information and we will assist you.Best regards
"tecreator, skyscanner is fine as a way of searching who flies a route, but you have to be careful about the search results. There will be all sorts of companies appearing, none of whom are linked to Skyscanner except by paying to appear there, and that's who you book with. You don't ever book with Skyscanner themselves."
"THE CUSTOMER NEVER COMES FIRST AT TRAVELGENIOI bought a return ticket from Milan (Italy) to Las Vegas (United States) over Frankfurt (Lufthansa/Condor) with Travelgenio. To be safe, I took an open ticket with a price increase of 99 euro. When I did this, the details sounded like the following: Your ticket doesn't allow changes? Don't worry! We guarantee that you always travel when you want. • ALL types of DATE CHANGES, including:o OUTGOING FLIGHTo INCOMING FLIGHTo RETURN FLIGHTo 1 FLIGHT SEGMENTo VARIOUS FLIGHT SEGMENTS• NO rate restrictions• NO administration feesDuring my stay in the US I had to change the dates of my return flight for cause majeure and wrote to Travelgenio getting this answer:“…, we inform you that considering the conditions of the airline, the change of dates will have an additional cost of 300 euros penalty + 0 europrice difference + 30 euro for administrative fees.Your open ticket could have been used until 48 hours before your outbound flight.”Reasonably worried, but thinking about a mistake, I called Travelgenio’s customer service, that went on repeating the same thing not seeing the nonsense (an open ticket you can modify only 48 hours before you fly out is a never heard of in my case) and adding on top that there would have been no cancellation and no refund of any sort. One of the operators told me that those were the terms & conditions of the airline, hence I called Condor, but they said something different: they would refund 80% of the return ticket, I had to deal with it through the agency though. My frustration grew.I called Travelgenio once again and repeated my problem to a female operator who treated me inconsistently like “what the hell do you want from me?” She asked if I had read the terms & conditions, and yes, I did, but could not find anything among the lines which may have helped me avoiding this mess. I asked repeatedly to talk with her manager, but she literally denied it, she did not have a manager, I could eventually call again and get another operator on the phone, but it would be useless, she meant.Finally I lost my flight, got stuck in the US and I am in financial difficulties. I wonder who is going to pay for the damage. Reading some web reports and comments, there are a lot of similar complaints, this agency apparently offers low cost offers by squeezing whatever they can from customers through untold or hidden tricks.

"Hi, we would like to know more about your demand. The flex ticket allows changes (sometimes airline do not allow them without this option), but the rates have to be refreshed with the real new date price. The changes can be made before the first leg flight, we mean, the first departure as airline understand the whole ticket as one, not only just one journey. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking info and we will contact you with all the explanation asap. Regards"
"""The changes can be made before the first leg flight"" wasn't written amongst terms and conditions and if it was, it was royally hidden which is deeply customer unfriendly, that was my main problem. Thank you very much for your availability, but with one email and four phone calls you weren't able to solve anything but adding additional costs.Thank you very much indeed: 982.02 euro from Italy to get stuck in the US."
Please tell us your booking code or send us all the info to the mail told to find out all your details. Regards
"Checked on the travelgenio site.The following (amongst other) is written if you press the icon with the Question mark during booking:""Conditions...No modifications are permitted for partially used tickets ... The FLEXIBLE Ticket service allows changing the date of the flights of the original ticket, if the new flights are within the same rate level. If the requested change means that higher rates or taxes apply, the price difference must be paid by the passenger.""""Seems pretty clear to me."
"Besides the fact that I commonly buy a flexible ticket for the RETURN flight, because usually that's the one which is mostly uncertain in the vast majority of cases (and of course, ""usually"" is not to be used in case of straight-forward terms & conditions), it would be advantageous having that specified in BOLD among the advantages of buying a flexi. Otherwise it's just a waste of money like in my case. This is an information of main importance which cannot be left hidden among the lines of an icon. If you click on the main terms & conditions bar you will not be able to find it, at least that is what happened to me prior buying the flights from Travelgenio.Seems pretty clear to me, too."
"I am not defending shonky third parties.But let's be logical here. No airline these days has an interest to have a middle man. The days where travel agents were key to sell tickets are gone with the internet. Good travel agents are still needed, but they are more specialised and can handle difficult arrangements.But most online travel agents feed on no real or very little price advantage. They live from fees and selling other products. They have no margin for quality customer service, as well. And some of them benefit from being far away, where the consumer can not pull them before a judge or where this makes economically no sense.So the moment you buy from one of these online travel agents, you have to be very careful and really read what you are buying and come clear with whom you are doing business and what the consequences can be.Also they are normally not breaking the law but they operate frequently just at the very limit of doing so. That again should sound alarm bells, before pushing the buy button.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Totally agree, time to get smarter."
I had made a mistake with the name and they changed it within the day for no extra charge. My flight is tomorrow.........holding my breathe since I can't check in online......I really hope its not a bad sign
"I have always used third party agents......I have used Priceline, Skyscanner, Expedia, eDreams you name it,So far no glitches.Those complaining about connections, maybe I don't understand it but aren't you the one who chooses what connections correspond to the price you are willing to pay. The direct flights are always more expensive, so don't choose cheap tickets and still expect to pay the same price as the direct flights....you can't fault the airline for that...that choice in entirely within your control"
"I have used airtickets.com I got the name changed in a few hours for free by an 'Andriana German' very friendly and helpful even though it was my fault. We have boarded all our flights without any major issues. I have always used 3rd party sites because of their flexible connections so far......so good.The airtickets.com call centre operators though are not very friendly I suspect it's because of English not being their first language...it's easy to misinterpret/misunderstand each otherThe flight choices are made by the purchaser so I don't understand the complaints about layovers, connections etc.....you should carefully go through all the options before purchasing"
"""even though it was my fault.""""you should carefully go through all the options before purchasing""---Good advice, which it appears you didn't follow yourself. Although my preference would be to book flights directly with the airline, why even bother adding another link onto the chain which can only complicate things."
">>>Although my preference would be to book flights directly with the airline<<<I'll second that! I think it's better to keep things as simple as possible, so I don't like adding layers between myself and the supplier."
Don't use Travelgenio. They Charge additional fee's not described at the booking momentVery bad experience
"Hi Paulo, please send us all the details about the charges and your booking info to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check them and contact you. Regards"
Travelgenio is without doubt the worst ever... they charge you fraudulently.. i booked two tickets and was shown a certain price after which i was taken to the payment gateway after payment i was scammed of an approx 200 USD extra without any information. This is the worst website ever and definitely a fraud they have every intention to cheat.. i would warn everyone to be real careful when booking on this site..
"Hi Ashish, the final price is shown before accepting the booking process. There are some discounts only available for a certain credit cards as shown in the first screen. If you paid with another one, maybe the discount was not available for the one used. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the charges before contacting you to explain them. Regards"

"Agree that among those agencies I used, Travelgenio is disappointing. They accepted my payment and a few hours later, write email to tell me the airline does not have the seat. And you know what? Instead of a direct flight of 7 hours, they had the cheek to suggest an alternative with travel time of 20 hours!!!! And need me to pay extra 50euros!!! Normal agencies will make sure that the seats are available before they accept payment. But travelgenio takes your money first, then later tell you no seat and offer you alternative that takes you to ""Antartica"" and you have to pay more! To add to the misery, they want you to officially write back to tell them if you accept the alternative or want to cancel. Before you know what to do, another email from them pop up to tell you to pay for your ORIGINAL itenary. That makes me happy as I thought travelgenio earlier email was a mistake. I spent money to make the overseas call to them and they say second email was a mistake.They made me cry. And they require to write back so that they can cancel my booking."
DON'T cancel - just do not accept the alternative offered.
"Hello ptww, of course we can help you with your booking status. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"<<DON'T cancel - just do not accept the alternative offered.>>And dispute the charge on your credit card.And then maybe, book directly with the airline. Just think how much your time is worth and then calculate. Notwithstanding of all other potential issues.Edited: 3 years ago "
Great advice from Frommy and Dubai_Phil!
Never use them! Scam!
"Hi THL888, if you need our support do not hesitate in contacting us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"The advice came from the experience gained, hence the need to shareBooking directly with the airlines would have cost at least twice what airtickets charged us.It was way cheaper and the combination from the travel airtickets smarter and logical connects.We used Etihad , checking from the Airline website one way tickets to just Rome which was not the complete journey were almost two and half times what we paid for, which included return tickets to Amsterdam as well.So no, booking directly with airlines is not always the smartest or cheapest optionEdited: 3 years ago "
"I was contemplating travelgenio,& then i read this,no chanceI went directly to PAL's website,PAL were $36 more than travelgenioDon't need to be a rocket scientist to work out paying the $36 more is my preferred option"
Hello guys;Any customers who require assistance regarding their bookings can contact us at customer.service@travelgenio.com. We will be pleased to assist.
">>>Don't need to be a rocket scientist to work out paying the $36 more is my preferred option<<<The cheaper price may not be available when it comes to the crunch. It's possible you would end up[ paying more with Travelgenio.yellowbandana, you may have made a mistake while searching the airlines sites, but how much did you save on the prices with Travelgenio compared to a direct booking?"
"Travelgenio is to avoid in any case, totaly unprofessionnal, they will take your money but you will never be sure your flight is really booked. And do not hope to get your money back, its never going to happen.In my case they allowed me to book a flight wich in reality never existed, I got stuck in an airport with an expiring visa, several (quite expensive) calls didnt help. I was lucky enougth to be able to book another flight by myself that same day."
"Hi Patrick, could you please tell us your booking code? We would like to know what happened in your booking. You can also contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. REgards"
Whatever you do DO NOT book through Travelgenio!!! We booked 2 tickets a year ago with an airline that went bankrupt within 2 weeks after booking. They refunded our money to Travelgenio almost a year ago but we can't get our refund. We have sent over 13 e mails with the written proof from the airline that our money was refunded and called at least 6 times but no refund. They are total scam artists! We have now reported them to the European travel association. Don't make the same mistake we made :(

I had a similar experience 2 weeks ago. My 80 yr old dad had to pay $320 to British Airways because Travelgenio fraudulently denied a date change. The ticket I paid for was not recognized by British Airways. Travelgenio is a FRAUDULENT agent probably run by someone in their basement.
"Travelgenio is a fraudulent agency, NEVER AGAIN!!"
"So true, I learned the hard way."

"Hi David, changes are made by airlines not by the travel agency. They are the ones able to make the schedule changes.

"Wanted to book a flight, stopped, read ... at Momondo and Skyscanner it was 166 € (Travelgenio), at Travelgenio's website it said 174,56 € plus 11.95 € credit card fee, but at the final checkout they actually take 23,89 €.Hence the total amounts to 198,45 € (≄166 €).F#ck that. Now I booked directly with the airline, paid 177,77 €.Travelgenio obviously (!) is a rip-off."
"Hello vonYorck, of course we can help you with your payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
I don't think vonYorck needs or wants your help. They said they have booked with the airline at a lower overall cost. Which is very sensible of them!
Worst agency ever. They sent me a ticket with wrong name and didn't issue me new ticket while airline said it's their responsibility. Their rud staff told me use the flight with wrong name or pay penalty and cancel the flight. At the end sent me an email saying it was my fault. rude. uncooperative. worse ever.

"Hi Mozhgan, during the booking process we cannot change nothing as it is an authomatic process. Moreover, before the confirmation, everything is shown to be confirmed. Could you please tell us your booking code to see the possibilities if the name has to be changed?"
"HUGE RISK NOT WORTH TAKINGABSOLUTELY do not book airline tickets by TRAVELGENIO ! They are complete con artists in my experience and it will cost you a lot more money in the end so do not be fooled by their cheaper prices!After myself and my 19 year old son spent all afternoon checking and double checking flights we finally booked. One week later we found out that the flights booked did not correspond to those that we booked via the web site. So we had to spend another 6 hours trying to buy a replacement ticket which increased 350 Euros over the those few hours as the 4 TRAVELGENIO helpline staff we spoke to kept us on hold for several hours and / or they cut us off so we had to call again and start the whole process again. Not cheap when they are based in south America. In the end we paid over 2000 Euros for return flights from France to NZ for my student son to attend a course. The start out price was 1200 Euros !Totally unhelpful staff just out to make money by making you wait for hours on the phone. We did not book the flight they claim, but we did not take a screen shot so cannot prove it. Unbeknown to us, they changed the outward bound flight, to a different month, but with completely different times (we know we did not book that flight as they were not good times for my son who was travelling alone for the first time ), so the flight was missed (we never received the tickets either !) and because of this the return flight is voided also, so new tickets had to be purchased and they charged a penalty also!"

New go with theses loosersEdited: 3 years ago 
"Travel2be is a scam. The price changes on the payment page. I didn't pay attention and got trapped. Then the ticket I bought was an open ticket, which charged me more than the airline anyway. I called, before the departure, to change the date. I was told the departure can't be changed and the return can't be changed before the departure. But the return is open and can be changed any time after the departure. A few months before the return, I called to change my return ticket. The representative said it's open, but I can only change before the departure and there's nothing he can do. I said this wasn't the company told me before and he simply hung up the phone. Probably he thinks there's nothing anyone can do to the company since there's no physical address on their webpage and god knows where he's hiding. The company and all its dealings are probably illegal."
We have received your mail. An agent will contact you with all the info asap. REgards
"hello, i booked a ticket with this agency, i saw a big mistake was made on the departure and arrival on the confirmation email. (i work for an air plane cie i know how to book a ticket).So i called to correct the reservation and they told me that they can not modify my booking and if i want to Cx it will be 30 euro/pax then they said if you book now and call back they will cx my first booking no fee. and i did now i have 2 bookings and no confirmation. the girls at the costumer contact centre keep hanging up on me.so they insulted me they took my money, and have no confirmation for my flight!  ****************DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS AGENCY!!!!****************"
<<i work for an air plane cie i know how to book a ticket>> Seems not to me.
"Hi Selma, once the dates are chosen we cannot change nothing as it is an authomatical process. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check your booking. Regards"
I'm afraid that I find myself in full agreement with Dubai_Phil.
"NEVER EVER BOOK with travel2be or travelgenio they are the worst company ever. i called to change my flights and spent 2 hours onthe phone while i was travelling. i explained to the consultant how i was wanting to come home early and gave her a few dates to search for new flights. she booked the wrong date and changed my flights to 20 days AFTER my original flight. I had to pay 300 to change it to the wrong date, they blamed it on me and then had to pay ANOTHER 300 to change it to the correct date i wanted. such a rip off and THEN i missed my flight because they didnt warn me about double checking the times with the airline. NOT IMPRESSED"
"The company replied to all the complaint by asking everyone to contact their customer service. It sounds like they are willing find a solution. No they don't. They did reply to my email, but insisted on their nonsense interpretation of the fact. The only way to nail this scammer down is to report to government agencies and sue them. I'd recommend everyone to report them to fair trade commission 'https://www.ftc.gov/' first."
"We cannot give you support from here but by our mail or phone, where our agents will be pleased to assist our customers in their issues.

Yes I accept the terms and conditions and I think you violate the terms. The term is I bought an open ticket. You didn't honor the open ticket. I'm not sure what's the point of sending another email. I'm simply looking for a solution myself and recommending us to do whatever is good for them. Thank you.
"It's the terms and conditions that will govern what you bought, not the word 'open' or any other description.

"#575, you represent travel2be? travel2be works like some car dealers by manipulating terms and conditions. I sued car dealers before to get compensation. travel2be deserves exactly the same."

The merest glance at my posting history should easily illustrate that I am no friend at all of shonky third party OTA's.On the other hand, I like to be fair and to offer factual advice. That is what I am trying to do here. If you are convinced that they have acted illegally, then report them, sue them, whatever you want. But there are no guarantees that you are going to win, and if they are based in Spain, where their actual rep states they are located, then that is where you will need to sue them.Edited: 3 years ago "

"Tried to change a date on the flight I booked thru this mob (Travelgenio), get given an Australian number to call that ends up to a Spanish call centre!

"I have purchased a Lufthansa ticket from Zurich to Bangkok with Travelgenio for a Wedding. Lufthansa made a change on the flight times, and no suitable alternatives were offered. The flight to Bangkok was even deleted from my reservation. I have requested a refund, and more than 3 weeks passed nobody can confirm if a refund will be issued or offer any alternatives.There is an horrible ping pong of responsibilities, and lots of contradictory information:- Travelgenio refuses to call Lufthansa, when Lufthansa says they have to call to help solve the problem. - Lufthansa claims they have not received the ticket money from Travelgenio, therefore no refund can be issued. But Travelgenio says they have paid and are actually waiting for the Lufthansa refund.As a customer im stuck in between, and Travelgenio does not really help with the situation. I will avoid intermediaries in the future."
"Hi Paulo, changes and cancellations are made by airlines to suit their flight plans. We can offer the alternatives they provide us to the changes. As told, we will check it and contact you back. Regards"
"Dear Travelgenio. What i know is the folowing:1) I have payed 1200€ for this flight.2) Currently my flight to BKK is deleted from the reservation.3) I have spent countless hours speaking on the phone with Travelgenio and Lufthansa.4) Lufthansa claims that refund and changes need to be done by Travelgenio. Travelg enio claims that Lufthansa needs to offer alternatives or confirm refund.5) Im the one without money or ticket and nobody can tell me when this will be solved. 6) I have learned that travel agencies like travelgenio work well only to book tickets. When problems arise, its a complete bureaucracy and much easier to solve when you book directly with the airlines.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Paulo, our team is working in your issue. Changes and cancellations are airline responsability, the same as the solutions. As intermediaries we can offer you the alternatives they give us for their passengers. In case of refund, they have to authorise them and process them. We are trying our best to solve your queries. RegardsEdited: 3 years ago "
And this illustrates all too well how much complication can be added by going through a third party.
After my case was passed to another department at travelgenio (urgent@travelgenio.com) it ended up fine. They immediately confirmed the refund and kept me posted on all updates. Already have the refund on my account.
"Hi Paulo, many thanks for your comment. We feel glad you updated your case. Regards"

"BEWARE OF USING TRAVELGENIO: I recently booked a trip through Travelgenio and mistakenly added their ""service package."" (I only wanted to order a wheelchair, which is a free service, but forgot to unclick - my fault.) Just before the last step, the price suddenly went up substantially. They said that the airline's price had increased in the fifteen minutes it took me to book, but this was not true. The confirmation they sent me listed the outbound flight as tourist class but the inbound flight as business class; and said we had NO baggage allowance of any kind. I phoned them and they told me that the business class was a mistake but confirmed that we could not have any baggage. I contacted the actual airline, which told me that my flight was tourist class both ways and that all passengers had a good amount of cabin baggage allowance. I asked about the ""service package"" and was told that the airline has no such package. When I re-contacted Travelgenio to find out what I was entitled to for the money, they said that the €40 I'd paid for the package is only for them to do you the ""service"" of contacting the airline if you want a wheelchair or a seat with extra legroom or a special meal. Anything I wanted would then have to be paid as an extra to the airline. BE VERY CAREFUL when booking with them. The few Euros you might save are more than taken away by their price increases and extras."

Their customer service is absolutely appalling.I have exchanged i don't know how many emails with them by now, they involuntarily changed one of my flights TWICE and both times I wrote back immediately to tell them that the change makes it impossible for me to catch my next flight. More than 10 emails and ONE MONTH later I still have no confirmation of my return flight from South America to Europe, which is in 3 days. I will not even go into how they didn't answer half of my questions, how it takes them DAYS to respond...and sometimes they just don't.Do NOT book with this company! It is a nightmare! I am interested if there is anyone who successfully sued them for damages?"

"DON'T BOOK WITH TRAVELGENIO!!! They booked me into Newark airport and 4 hours later - out of JFK!It was insane! It is in another State. For international flights, you need to be there three hours before, the shuttle takes two hours with no traffic. I had to take a taxi, which cost me over 100 dollars and carry my baggage onto the plane, throwing out everything that could not make it past security. They also lied to me on the phone and told me I could re-book my return flight with a flexible ticket, when I booked it they sent me NO information about the conditions and when I tried, was told over the phone that I could not and then HUNG UP ON!!! Really, really irresponsible company."
"Also, I would like to sue them for damages and am looking into a lawyer at the moment."

"Dear Marius, as we have informed you by mail, the lugagge included for the rates offered depend on the airline policy and it is always shown during the booking process. If you want to add it, we have to follow their policy. Sometimes the lower rates are the ones more restrictive in these terms. If you need further info, reply our mails. Regards"
airtickets.com is horrendous and very expensive. They do not show all the costs until after you have paid! It really is so much easier to stick to booking directly through the airline. I have just used them to book flights and NEVER again.
"My 18 year old daughter recently had a trip planned to go Melbourne for a week she was very excited and had booked her ticket with Tiger Air. The morning she was due to fly she started to get a severe headache and vomiting and missed the flight. She started feeling a little better so we booked her another fight which cost $450.00 from Sydney we booked through Travelgenio. Unfortunately my daughters condition deteriorated and she was suffering from her first migraine that lasted three days.The Doctor said no flying and gave her a certificate, I emailed it to Travelgenio straight away 12 hours before the flight explaining the situation. After three days my daughter could actually turn on her computer she had an email advising that she had to 12 hours to confirm the cancellation and pay 30 euros. The email was two days old.She explained to the company that there was no way she could have answered the email she couldn't even handle daylight let alone go through her emails. Travelgenio point blank said too bad basically, we are still emailing them asking what is the point of the insurance, if you are in a coma in hospital and can't return a bloody email what's the point of it. I'm furious not only did the poor kid miss the trip but she is also $450 out of pocket which is a lot to student with only a part-time job.Do not book with Travegenio !!! by the way Tiger Air refunded the first ticket within a couple of days."
"Ali, could you please send us all the info to customer.service@travelgenio.com? We will check the insurance guidelines and also the airline ones for these cases. Regards"
************************************* DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! ***************************************This company is quite happy to take more from your card than you authorise and then try and cover it up stating that it is 'card fees' when even their own confirmation email states otherwise.

I will never use this company again and in fact will go out of my way to ensure that they lose as much business as possible as I do not want other people to be robbed like this. What a disgusting company. I have documentary evidence to support this that I am willing to share if anyone is in any doubt.

"Hi Squidgearooney, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Really? not what your advisor stated on the phone.... funny that... now you want to discuss it when it is made public. I have just sent you an email with the details and I am posting this to let everyone know this. I will then follow this with an update when you respond, if indeed you do."
"This seems to be their standard practice as I had the same experience.Wholeheartedly agree with ""************************************* DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!"""
"I think you may be correct. I got a response to my email stating:In reference to your inquiry, we inform you that the prices shown on the availability page are subject to discounts and possible administrative fees.firstly this is completely different to what I was told on the phone which was that the extra fee was because of the credit card I used.and second, the price stated previously for the original amount states quite clearly that it is inclusive of fees.What a joke. The problem for them is that I really am like a dog with a bone and I am more than happy to chase this through the courts in Spain where they are based and subsequently the european courts if I have to"
Perhaps you could have researched who you were throwing your money at before doing so? Please keep the forum informed of progress through the Spanish courts.
thanks for your helpful input there
If you need further regarding your case please answer our mails. As we can see our agents gave you all the information. REgards
"Stay away from Travelgenio. Charge fees for nothing!I tried to use travelgenio to book a flight to St.-Petersburg, Russia. After I finished booking I got an e-mail from them with the booking number. In 10 minutes I got another mail saying that my card was rejected. So I used the same credit card to book a flight directly from Aeroflot and this time there was no problem with payment. I almost forgot about travegenio but later I found out that despite Travelgenio was not able to receive a payment they were still able to charge me the fee (10 euro), which doesn't make any sense as it was still the same credit card! I paid a fee for nothing. And for me it is a theft."
"Hi Nomadkml, please send us all the details of the booking you tried to made and the charges information to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Sometimes the payment does not go through because of the card limits but, as the fees are lower, this amount can be charged. We will check it and contact you back. REgards"
"and here they go again trying to insinuate untruths and lying.... travelgenio... the last email you sent to me is:Dear Paul,Thank you for your answer.All the information we gave you in our previous email is correct.The final price is always shown before making the payment.As indicated before our department will study your case and give you an answer as soon as possible.Best Regards,-- Ana MaríaUser Satisfaction AgentTravelgenio.comClearly therefore the ball is in your court and I am awaiting your response. What a joke your company are. It is going to give me the upmost pleasure to see your company in ruins after the court case."
Could you please tell us your booking code please? We can see our team has informed you about your refund. RegardsEdited: 3 years ago 
"travelgenio is the worst company i ever used to order tickets from, Don't make the mistake i did. Don't order your tickets from them, they want us to pay about 45% of our flight price to correct a mistake they did"
"Hi Dor, our team is currently checking your case as told in other social net. You will receive a reply to your mail asap. Regards"
"Glad to say that I have been informed by Travelgenio that they will be refunding the €40 difference in the actual price and the price they charged to my card.They had argued since the very first instance that the fee charged was correct, giving different reasons for this, and stating that I was wrong. Funnily enough, I contacted the police in Madrid where Travelgenio are based and made a report of fraud, I then informed Travelgenio that I had done this and what do you know, within half an hour they are giving me a refund, how coincidental.Not happy that they stated that they are refunding me 'as a courtesy', there was absolutely no courtesy involved when I spoke to their agent who blatantly lied to me and no courtesy at all until the authorities were involved.Anyway, my refund has apparently been issued (will let you know if this actually comes through), and I will not be using this company again."
We keep at your disposal by mail if you need further info. REgards
I have to add that after several days of negotiations Travelgenio issued a refund. I still can't see it on my bank account but it usually takes up to two weeks. I am glad that at the end Travelgenio did a right thing. Thanks.
It has been a pleasure. Regards
I have just had the same experiences with airtickets.com as Dor P and Squidearooney have had with travelgenio. Are the two companies related?
"I do not believe that the 2 are related. Travelgenio are based in Madrid, Spain and airtickets.com are based in London, England. I have had a brief check, not in depth, and I cannot see any obvious link."
"This company is the absolute worst. If you live in the states, and are unable to call a European number for free, then STAY AWAY. You will only be able to communicate with them via email, and they will take on average 5 business days to reply. The agents are extremely unhelpful. I purchased a ticket in May 2016 for a trip to Trinidad in February 2017. They ended up charging my card TWICE, but the problem was fixed via my bank. Of course I purchased the insurance but make sure to read carefully which insurance because one of them is basically a hoax. I turned ill, and had to cancel the trip. When it came to using my insurance (which I paid extra for), I was hit with the BIGGEST HASSLE of life. You would think that they were refunding me my money from their own personal pay check. It was ridiculous. I provided them with a doctor's note, and they refused to accept it. Short of turning in my personal medical records, they refused to honor the insurance policy that I paid extra for. Mind you this was after it took them days to reply to my email requesting to cancel. I had to practically research every department's email before receiving a response. When they finally responded to my 3rd email, it was to copy and paste the insurance policy, no real explanation as to why they wouldn't cancel, just that they deemed my doctor's note invalid. Finally, my doctor contacted them personally on the hospital's phone (super long distance), and they informed me the hospital's ""stamp"" was required. I am not sure why they are going through such measures to assist me when I purchased insurance and provided them with a doctor's note. Finally they are willing to let me use my insurance for my ticket. The problem with the refund is because they double charged my card in May, my bank closed that card for my protection. The refund for my security could only be submitted to that card. The email from their agent requested I inform them how I would like to move forward once I have contacted my bank. I replied back and specifically told them NOT to refund but to instead reschedule my ticket. I wrote them at least four times, and waited over a week for a response. I finally called the airlines directly yesterday (3/6/17) only to find out that they had refunded the ticket already without my approval. This refund only gave me 85% of my money back instead of allowing me to reschedule with the full amount of my ticket. Needless to say, you are better off booking with expedia or priceline. I would rather pay more to not feel like I have been scammed. The amount of stress I gained while being sick and dealing with their terrible customer service has been ridiculous. Planning your vacation is not worth all of this hassle. Stay away from this INEFFECTIVE company."
"Hi Saradia, could you please send us all the info to customer.service@travelgenio.com to check what you are commenting? You can also tell us your booking code and we will get in touch with you. Regards"
Saradia.....book directly with the airline....never with any third party!
Our team has already sent you the info to your mail Saradia and are waiting for you to reply with some info. Regards
Never book your tickets through travelgenio. They don't answer calls and will not let you change flying dates or cancel the ticket. Always go directly to the airline office. Never ever rely on travelgenio. Had the worst experience with them. They put my call on hold and then cut it off. Waste of money!!

"Thanks Plassat for the info, we have send it to our team. They will get in touch with you by mail asap with all the info. Regards"
"PLEASE AVOID TRAVELGENIO!!!I trusted Momondo but found that Travelgenio have very misleading business practices. I was overcharged massively from the original quoted price. There ""personalised service"" implies all sort of additional extras, but actually gives you nothing - you still have to pay for all the options that it says that it includes. It would have been much cheaper to go direct to the airline. I was charged more than double to add a baggage allowance by Tavelgenio (Travelconio). To call them, is costs more than it should and they take ages to do anything. Their customer service is poor. When you email them, they bounce your email back to you. They do then reply, in poor English, just repeating that there charges are non refundable.PLEASE AVOID - Just go directly to the airline."
"Hi Jackie, please send us all the details and amounts to our mail customer.service@travelgenio.com and our team will check the booking process to find out what had happened. Regards"
"Dear Travelgenio, Thank you for your prompt response.I have sent the latest email communications between Travelgenio and me, which include the details of charges, to your customer services email address, as requested. Please let me know if you need any further information.Regards, Jackie."
"Hi RojBlake, Thanks you for your response. Yes, I appreciate that there is a lesson to be learned. In the past, I have been vigilant in checking out third party companies. In this instance, I had just come out of hospital, having had an E Coli infection which affected my transplanted kidney, so have not been on top form mentally (Sorry if that is too much info!) I also thought that Momondo was safe and trustworthy - so another lesson to be learned.I found flights from Norwich to Florence via Momondo with Travelgenio. I believe that each ticket was £210 or £212 - I cannot say for certain, as I never received a complete breakdown of the charged - in itself, rather irregular. I seem to remember (but I might be incorrect) that tax or airport charges was added to the price of each ticket. I then opted for a personalised service for each ticket, at £16 per ticket, as this offered all sorts of additional services, including being able to select your seats. I was then charged £7.95 per ticket to pay by debit card, which I thought was unusual, and a bit steep, but paid it anyway.When I received my e-tickets online - I noticed that the baggage allowance was zero; I have never encountered this before. There was very little information on the eticket or on the confirmation of booking email. I had to phone Travelgenio, on a costly phone line, to sort the problem out. The lady that spoke to me implied that the only way that I could add baggage allowances to the tickets was to pay 100 euros for 2 tickets. I questioned this, but felt that I did not have any other options.A short while later, I checked the KLM website and found that I could have bought the same tickets for £220 each and that the baggage allowance per ticket would have been £21.70.I contacted Travelgenio and requested to select my seats, since this was one of the features of the ""personalised service"" that I had paid for. But, I was told me that they would charge me for this - the personalised service only covers the cost of them actioning the seat selection - which would take me a couple of minutes online.I questioned why they charged me over double for the baggage allowances - I can only assume that they have added a massive service charge for this - but I had already paid for the personalised service! They have still not answered this question.I have asked what I actually get for the personalised service, since all the options included are charged additionally for; they have not yet answered this point satisfactorily either.Their email responses tell me that I agreed to pay the charges, and they are all non-refundable. My mistake - I agree, but hopefully my posting will warn others away from TRVAELGENIO's dubious and misleading business practices.JackieEdited: 3 years ago "
"Well, I thought that was too hopeful!I responded quickly to your request and, today, received another rather bland email telling me that the charges are all non-refundable.So you respond quickly on a public forum to imply to unwitting potential customers that you have high standards of customer care - but you really have not looked into my complaint at all! You have not answered my questions as to why you charge so much for baggage allowance (over double what the airline charges), what I get for the ""personalised service"" that I paid for - nothing, it would seem - and why you charge so much, per ticket, to use a debit card.I can only reiterate to future potential customers to AVOID TRAVELGENIO and always go direct to the airline website first.Jackie"
"I'm sorry about your illness, Jackie. I hope you're feeling better.It's my opinion that third parties like Travelgenio rely on the fees and charges to actually make a profit. I don't believe they would make sufficient money to keep going based on just selling flights. I am pretty certain that revenue streams like higher baggage and card fees are part of that, and deliberately so. I don't think that they will ever admit that's the case, though.Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that not enough people look for warnings and stories like yours. I hope I'm wrong, and I do admire your good intentions in trying to help others, but I don't think your message is going to have much effect."
"Our team informed you about all the information regarding the charges and the terms and conditions of the services you contracted. We follow the policies of everything. If you need further info, do not hesitate in contacting us by mail. Regards"
"All of those who have been overcharged by Travelgenio....This happened to me recently, I too got the same brick wall attitude saying that it was various fees and that I had agreed to it, bland emails and basically going nowhere.That was until I reported this to the police in Madrid where Travelgenio are based, you can file a report online, very easy. I then told Travelgenio that I had reported this matter as fraud and theft and guess what, the very same day I got an email back stating that they were refunding me the amount that they had overcharged me. I got the refund a few days later.Don't put up with this, they obviously know that they are on thin ground if a simple report to the police gets such a quick response."

"That is a confusing post.<<booking status appeared as confirmed and paid>> Where? With the airline?<<my payment had not been processed>> Did you not see this on your credit card charges?I do not understand how something can show as confirmed and paid if it is not in reality. Equally, if I am not getting charged, then I would assume that I also do not get tickets."
travelgenio is very very bad.They trick you with prices and at checkout you pay extra.. sometimes much more extra.Avoid!

I can tell you from personal experence that these bulk airline ticket compaines are dangerous.
"I purcahesd some tickets thru an app called JET RADAR, (i have used it before locally and got a small discount booking last minute.) which ended up purchasing thru AIRTICKETS. The passenger information page is very simple, no address info, passport info, or middle name. I made a mistake, and entered my Daughter's friend's middle name as her surname and the ticket was issued improperly. I called AIR tickets and they tried to charge me to cancel the booking and rebook at a higher p[rice which i refused to do. After that they all but refused to help i the matter at all and went so far as sending me an email that said that UNITED AIRLINES would not allow the name change. I called United multiple times and they said they had no record of any inquiry on the booking in question. The Sales rep Anastasia Alifragki, sent me an email suggesting that i cancel the entirety of the booking, and lose 3000.00USD.I had spent hours on the phone with both United and this air tickets, as well as another horrible company called ""TRIPSTA"" all because of a clerical error on a very poorly designed website. My Advice to anyone using these subsidiary air ticket companies, is this: Realize that you are taking a gamble, that if you have ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL, with your booking that you are no longer following the terms set forth by the actual airline, but of the travel agency who makes its living off of its very difficult and inflexible policy.I travel alot and have had many annoying encounters with airlines in my life but this one was the worst, based on its sheer ridiculousness."

"Indeed, you even said the mistake was yours, themonsheshe! If the website was poorly designed, why did you continue to proceed with the booking? Or did it seem OK at the time and it's only now you are convinced it caused you to make a mistake?"
"DO NOT book with Travelgenio or EDreams,We booked tickets in July 2016 to Australia and had nothing but trouble with them changing flight times and poor communication. They wanted us to get a refund on the original flights and then purchase the same flights again (but with Qantas rather than Jetstar), but excepted me to pay double the cost, as it was 'easier' for them to manage!!!Qantas representative states if the airline changes the flights then the travel agent has authority to accept passengers request (which I requested back in January 2017). However they continued to offer other options, despite informing them I was travelling with family members and wanted to be on the same flight.Travelgenio had the audacity to say the airline needs a confirmation in 2 days!! After dealing with them (by phone and numerous emails) for over 3 months and my flights are still not sorted, and I fly out in 4 days.Well, I HOPE!I don't believe they understand the English language as they don't respond to the points highlighted in my email or understand clear instructions/requests.I will NEVER use these types of companies again, go direct to airline."
"Hi, changes have to follow the airlines and ticket policy, accepted during the booking process. Please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check once more the possibilities. Regards"
I purchased a ticket on Saturday morning and I got the confirmation email. On Sunday I get another mail from travelgenio saying the airline had cancled my ticket but travelgenio was able to find me the exact dates but with a difference of 25 EUR. I wrote to them asking what was the reason. Didn't get any reply. Today I get another mail from travelgenio saying I need to pay 25 EUR in order for them to issue my electronic ticket. What nonsense is this? I paid the amount for my ticket which was written on the website in time of purchase. They never mentioned anything of an additional 25 EUR for the electronic ticket. Terrible!!!!
"Hi Shevimon, we would like to know more about your case to understand why you received that mail. Sometimes the ticket are not confirmed by airline and maybe that is what happened in your case and our team sent the current rate for the tickets you were looking for. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com, we will check it and contact you by mail. Regards"
""" I paid the amount for my ticket which was written on the website in time of purchase.""Simple. That price did not exist."
"It's pretty common, shevimon. Many third party sites don't have live pricing. You make a request to book a ticket and by the time your request gets to be processed, the price is no longer available. Companies will usually be loathe to admit that, so they come up with various excuses instead.The clues are often there in the T&C's, which I always read but it appears that most people don't."
"Concerning travelgenio.com......I had very bad experiences and cannot recommend them at all. I payed 99 Euro extra for a ""Flexible Ticket"" ( …travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and… ), which grants that the flight can be rescheduled - In their own words: ""The FLEXIBLE Ticket service is an exclusive service of our agency which guarantees that your change request will be processed even if tickets can no longer be changed directly with the airline."" - But when trying to reschedule my flight Travelgenio refuses to do so.The whole thing is a scam - a dishonest way to make money by deceiving people.Since then I prefer to pay a little bit more and book my flights via serious companies. At the end this is much less frustrating - and cheaper as well."
"Hi Nitidoku, of course we can help you with the management of your flex ticket. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and the arrangement you want to make and we will tell you if it is possible and the steps to follow. Regards"
Hi Travelgenio. This would be the forth email. So I only believe you if I finally get a confirmation of the rescheduled flight. I will post the result here...
"Hi Nitidoku, Flex ticket allows you to make changes, as stated in the terms and conditions of the service, before the first leg flight. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check your petition and we will inform you about the possibilities. Regards"
"Hi Travelgenio customer service. I just sent another Email with the booking code to the address given in your post. Let's see if it works. I'll post the result on this list later... Regards...By the way, the terms and conditions can be found here: …travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and… . I tried to understand what you mean by ""first leg flight"" - but a textual search for ""leg flight"" doesn't return anything. Reading the conditions concerning the paragraph ""Flexible Ticket"" didn't give any result either..."

"""I tried to understand what you mean by ""first leg flight""""First leg = first flight on your ticket. E.g. if you're booked to fly Edinburgh-London-NYC, the first leg is the flight from Edinburgh to London."
"Thank you, lexexpress. Anyway, the term is not mentioned neither in ""Travelgenio Terms"", nor in the paragraph defining the term ""Flexible Ticket"" by listing its conditions. Actually it is not used on travelgenio's site at all, as can be verified easily with google: https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=site:travelgenio.com+leg+flightActually, I cannot even find something similar in meaning in the respective paragraph. So I wonder to what Travelgenio is referring to when saying ""Flex ticket allows you to make changes, as stated in the terms and conditions of the service, before the first leg flight"". As it is a quite normal procedure to reschedule flights, a ""Flex ticket"" which is so inflexible would rather look like a joke anyway :)"
Do not book with travelgenio they are scam artists! They ruined our honeymoon by cancelling our ticket / most unhelpful/ couldnt get through on the phone! Never returned calls or promised to on numerous occasions email when email never arrived! Kept over 1500 of our hard earned cash for return flights from dublin to bali. Spent hours on the phone trying to sort it.Most unhelpful compamy I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.They only reply when you shame them on twitter which i will keep doing until they send our refund! Absolute scammers! Avoid at all costs.
"So here - as promised - the result of my email conversation with customer.service@travelgenio.com:Their posting further up on this page:> [...] of course we can help you with the management of your flex ticket. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and the arrangement you want to make and we will tell you if it is possible and the steps to follow. [...]That's what I did.The response was, that they actually cannot - and that the reason is the following condition ""No modifications are permitted for partially used tickets"". Now I wonder how I can have used my ticket partially as it is dated in the future. I also find it quite astonishing that they call a ticket, which cannot be changed per definition, a ""Flexible Ticket"", and bill 99 Euro more for this extra service.So here again my advise: Do yourself a favor and book your tickets via a honest company - even if it seems to be a little bit more expensive on the first view. On the long term you will save a lot of time and money - and your nerves will be grateful as well. I had to pay for this insight more than 460$ and probably it will cost me another 500$ because I now have to find a one-way ticket fast - unfortunately all this money goes to a company I am not very fond of having supported at all..."
"Hello Nitidoku;Our team sent you an email some days ago informing you of the flex ticket conditions.""No modifications are permitted for partially used tickets""If you need more info we will try to assist you at customer.service@travelgenio.com as soon as possible.Best regards."
"We purchased our flight tickets long before for the flight from Santiago de Cuba to Havana on 3rd April with Cubana . When we wanted to confirm the flight on the same day early in the morning at the Cubana office, it was said :""they were cancelled"" (still we do not know whether the flight was cancelled or our seats??) and we were offered another flight in the next day. It was impossible to change our itinerary because of other reservations and connection flight. They refused to pay refund but with a great difficulty, gave us a certifico explaining the situation. The internet and telephone connections were extremely difficult in Santiago, we tried several times to communicate with Travelgenio, however they do not have a direct E mail address and their telephones (in Spain) could not answer. It was a frustrating situation. Then we could hire a taxi by paying great amount of money and reached to Havana with 10 hours travel . Cubana office in Havana airport advised us to take the refund through Travelgenio, but it seems they are dissappeared now. We could only write and explain our situation through their survey web page and get no answer so far. Please do not rely on this company at all. They do not have exact address and a communication center.Armagan and Selma Kurra"
"Hi Armagan, please send us all the booking info to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our team will check what happened with the flights. Changes and cancellations are operated by the airline to suit their flight plans. We will check the alternatives they providen and contact you asap. Regards"
"I wanted to book a flight from Munich to Entebbe. Comparing prices with idealo.de Airtickets was the cheapest with 1119 €. After filling the booking form the booking stopped with a message, that the price has changed to 1355 €. It happened several times. Very dubious manner to be top ranked and seduce customers on their website."
"Hi,Here a short summary of the answer travelgenio sent me - so that other users can form their own opinion.Unfortunately tripadvisor does not allow images. So here the content in text form...When booking the ticket you get a window with the following information (translation of the original into English): Flexible Ticket  Your ticket does not allow changes? No worries! We grant you that you can fly whenever you want. All kinds of changes included: - outbound flight - return flight - outbound flight and return flight - a part of a flight - several parts of the flight No restrictions concerning the fare No handling feesIn the upper right corner is a tiny (i) symbol. Travelgenio informed me, that - if you press on this one - and be assured that nobody will ever do so as it is hardly visible - you then get to another page with the real conditions of the ""flexible"" ticket. If you had found this page - as travelgenio told me again, as I, of course, have not found it -, you might find as part of a long list of further condition the following ambiguous sentence: ""For partly used tickets no change are possible"". And this is what travelgenio will answer you if you actually try to change your ticket... I am pretty sure - but don't want to waste more time on this topic - that there are other conditions which can be used for refusing every other wish you ever might have... For this great service you pay 99 Euro extra...So on you to decide if you want to rely on this company...Have a wonderful flight - and good luck with your tickets!"
If you have any further doubt regarding the flex ticket option do not hesitate in contacting as a reply to our mails. The terms and conditions of the service are sent also. Regards
"I recently booked a flight with Travelgenio. I was satisfied with the price of the flight which is why I booked with them. I also believe I had used their company before with no issues. This time was a bit frustrating for me. I submitted my credit card and confirmed the booking on my end, received an email from Travelgenio stating that I should be getting another email once the payment had been accepted. I waited about 7 hours and did not receive any email confirming my flights or payment. I began to worry if I had actually been scammed! So, I called the company and twice I was instructed to call back in 5 minutes because the customer service representative did not speak English. I really began to worry. The third time I called, I was finally able to speak with a representative who spoke English. I was a bit frustrated so I explained my situation and requested that my booking be completely cancelled. After giving the representive my booking code, she put me on hold and returned to the call quite beta-like (maybe embarrassed), the tone was different for sure. She said they could not charge my credit card and did not have a reason as to why. I asked her if she could send me a confirmation of my cancellation and she told me that I could call back if I needed any confirmation. I have been watching my credit card since the booking, nothing has been charged from Travelgenio and I just received a cancellation confirmation email. So, ultimately I feel good about the fact that they did not charge my card and were able to cancel my booking without any extra charges, but I was not satisfied/confident with the booking, customer service, and I'm still concerned about the fact that they have my credit card number. Ultimately, I do not trust this company and would not recommend booking through them if you want to feel confident in your purchase."
"This was my first and last time to ever buy anything from TravelGenio, it has the worst service I have ever seen in my life.This complaint is related to the website http://es.travelgenio.com (Travelgenio/travel2be)I have booked a two-way flight for my wife through TravelGenio to Start from City A, having transit in City B, thentransit in City C, and final Destination City D, and return ticket in the same order.When I received the booking itinerary, it mentioned that I can do changes to the booking but it has to be beforemore than 24 hours from first flight ... which was fine.Unfortunately, my wife wasn't granted visa to City-D, which was the destination of the flight; therefore I had to call TravelGenio to change the booking.First of all, the number mentioned in the email doesn't function, I had to actually search in google for the contactnumber and email, then I finally found it.I sent more than one email to them in order to get a feedback,I got a response after few days, saying that I have to pay this much fees, and other fees depending on the newflight status.I sent another email to change the last flight from City C to D, to be from C to E, however, no body responded formultiple days; therefore I had to call them.Once I called TravelGenio call center, I spent around 80 minutes of international call just to try to change thebooking, while more than 50 minutes of this call I was ON-HOLD !!!Thank God I can speak Spanish, since many of the call-center agents only speak Spanish.And after all this time, I wasn't able to change ANYTHING ...I wasn't allowed to change the last flight (from C to D), I wasn't able to postpone the ticket, I wasn't able tochange the name of the passenger, I wasn't able to do NOTHING even though I was willing to pay to do thechanges ...I even asked them to cancel the trip between City C and D and terminate the flight in City C, but that was notpossible either.I wasn't able to cancel the booking either ... so pretty much, if my wife didn't go on that plane, all the money I paid for this long trip is gone ...I have contacted the specific airlines in the booking to ask them if I can change the booking, and they said onlyTravelGenio can do it since they are the one who booked it.I ended up letting my wife go on the flight until City-C with a hand-bag, and cancel the last flight to City-D with the airlines (which worked). And I bought her two way Tickets from City-D to E, hoping that I can get her to the plane from City-C back to City-A using the booking. However, TravelGenio has canceled the whole return flight ... and I had to buy her a new one way ticket that is double the regular price (1,540 USD) since they couldn't do any changes from their side to RE-ISSUE the flight from City-C to B.They even told me that they will refund the return ticket, but after waiting more than a month ... they replied withthe below:""We apologize for the delay.We regret to inform you that the airline has refused the partial refund of your ticket as the schedule change waslower than 3 hours."""
"Hi Loay, any changes in the tickets one emitted have to be authorised both by the ticket conditions and by the airline. Please send us all the info to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check all the process we followed. Regards"
"I just booked a flight thru travelgenio. First of all they add an extra charge for special service which I dint request. Secondly, when I am call their customer service number no response and thridly, they don't have any e-mail address to get in touch with them. I am even wondering what kind travel agent skyscanner puts up on their website. Don't waste your money on this."

"It's abit late but I hope that will stop someone buying from travelgenio.comI've just purchased 2 tickets from them and until I hit the purchase button price was $1594.63 and there is another confirmation checkbox at the very buttom of the page that says ""I have read and accept the General Conditions of Travelgenio and the privacy and data protection policy and I agree to pay a total of 1594.63 AUD for this purchase"" once I hit the purchase button it become 1727.55 AUD!!! I've called their customer support and tried to explain my situation however person at the other end of the line didn't even let me finish my word and pushed his template sentence saying ""Look sir you have two options either cancel your tickets and pay €30 for each passenger or accept it and fly"". I said listen price got changed after I click the purchase but... and get his answer before I finish ""I know what you saying but you have two options...""I've waited for him to finish but couldn't hold my self after he repeated him self third time. /)-_-) Hey list.. you have two options...(`;`(\ /)`.`) look I'm tryin...

"2 years ago last week, a flight I'd booked through Travelgenio (1st leg of a 6 leg trip) was cancelled by the airline. I was told it would be refunded, but after a year of excuses and lies from Travelgenio, no money was forthcoming. They blamed the airline and claimed they'd never received the money but the airline confirmed they had refunded to them 8 days after the (non-) flight. I had insurance for the trip but as neither the airline nor Travelgenio would give me the information the insurance needed, I ended up out of pocket there too. All I can advise is to learn from my mistake and never book through this dishonest, stealing company."
"#694 reported as duplicate - previously posted in this same thread about a year ago (#299).Andrew O, you only need to post about your situation once.There are plenty more people out there who (like you) do no research, buy the first cheapest thing they can find, and then post a (new) complaint after they have a problem and don't get any satisfaction from the OTA. Adding one more complaint to the list won't really help someone who is determined to do it wrong.-JimG"
"The best way to deal with problems with them is to dispute the charge with your credit card company and to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).

"I agree TRAVELGENIO is the WORST travel agency EVER: ask you if you wanna bring animals, if you wanna have larger seats, if you wanna have special meal and they DO NOT ask you if you want checked luggage!?!?!I booked and the result is that I booked a flight without checked luggage and, to add the checked LUGGAGE, I have to pay almost the same amount I paid for the ticket!If I would know that the ticket with checked luggage would cost double price I would booked another flight, probably with another agency.Do you think is this FAIR?? come on! be serious! I use to buy many tickets per month and, of course this is the last time I will book with your agency! an, oc course, I will not recommend at all to anyone will ask me about an online travel agency or about you1Edited: 3 years ago "

I think it is great that at representative from Travelgenio is at least present on this forum and is trying to offer some solutions so we should at leats give him or her some credit for this.
What evidence is there that they are actually helping people rather than just trying to make it look as if they care?
"I strongly dis-encourage to book with them! They tricked me with the price, by opening a pop-up page while I was on another company. Result, I paid 200 dollars more!!They are just an opportunist company!!"

"I just booked a flight on Travel genio. Never again. (I have in the past and had no problem.)I was very careful to check that using Visa non-debit card did not add any charges. I chose that card type, which displayed +0.0When I clicked the button my card was charged 36 euro over the quoted price.Almost no way to get to customer support from the site."
"Hi jegirl, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
This is the worst company I ever dealt with. It took over 30 phone calls and at least 25 emails to solve a problem they created. Do not trust them and best do not deal with them in the first place
"Yes, it seems the mysterious ""deduction"" disappears when you choose any credit card. One credit card listed a 19 euro reduction. Others were all 0.0, so I had no reason to consider it as relevant. I'm not sure, but I think the reduction goes away when you choose a credit card, and I only saw it exactly as I clicked OK."

"Well said, susiesnowflake.There are far too many complaint posts which read along the lines of ""I bought a non-refundable ticket and the company would not issue a refund"", or ""I booked a flight which had 17 connections and the trip was far too long"", or""I decided to fly to New Zealand instead of Mexico, the company refuses to change my ticket"""
I have found them really bad to deal with - dishonest regarding baggage charges.
This is your standard useless reply which nobody ever follows up on emails. You can not be trusted!!!

You are not telling the truth in your standard reply
I got a notification that I was being refunded to my credit card. It looked kind of official. So far neither the original charge or the refund have shown up. I will update.In the past I have used them without problems. I think they are reconsidering their policies. In the past I did find the cheapest tickets on this site.

"Hi,www.travelgenio.com, small suggestion please have trained motivated customer care as representatives.Was looking to book a flight for 4 people during summer vacation and little search landed me at travelgenio, where I tried to purchase a ticket but fortunately didn't do it. The reason is, my son has a long name with 16 letters and the number of letters allowed while booking the ticket through travelgenio is only 15. Due to this, have contacted the customer care. Though I could connect after 20 mins by presssing some numbers as said by ATM. One respectful lady has picked up the call and she cannot understand either German or English. The way she spoke is like not handling the customer so preciously, instead she has no patience (so irritative), being taken into consideration have disconnected the call. So, if you are looking for some air tickets or good customer service people do spend some timeFor any business to grow, please treat Customer as a King. This statement should be followed by each and every business entity."

"Service on Travelgenio.com is poor and price is misleading. They offer discount on ticket if we pay by Master Credit card. The list price shown in Skyscanner is the price after discount. However, Travelgenio Web site is misleading and do not explain that. I've bought two tickets from Travelgenio yesterday. They list the price as AUD$174 each, total as $348.00. The web site showed -$8.75 under Master Card icon and did not explain this is the discount. I thought this was handling fee, so I clicked on the other Master card icon with $0.00 under. Then price showed in the Travelgenio.com became $365.50 which was the price without discount. After I clicked on ""purchase"", I was charged for $384.30, which was $36.00 more, which was the most expensive offer among those offers listed by skyscanner.I called Travelgenio and they said I clicked the credit card without discount. Even without price, the prices should be $365.50, but I was charged at $384.30. Travelgenio charged me extra cost without any good explanation.RegardsJonathan"

Could you please tell us your booking code to check out your case in detail and contact you please?Edited: 3 years ago 
Every one of my emails contained the pertinent information. No help and no solution. You sold me a first class ticket and no first class existed with this airline. All you ever state that you are sorry for your mistake but you can do nothing about it. Rotten company!!!
We need to identify the reservation in order to check your case in detail once more. With your nickname un this plataform we cannot identify your Booking. Could you please tell us your Booking Code? Thanks for your collaboration. Regards

"what a joke you are! I have just had the exact same experience, and will be taking legal action for your company providing deliberate misleading information to customers"
"do not book with these guys, absolute rip off, they charge you for a personalized service which appears to include seat selection and baggage but actually includes nothing.I am currently seeking legal advice as I believe this to be a deliberate provision of misleading information provided to consumers"
"And tell me, Maryanne, where do you intend to take legal action against a company based in Spain?"
"What a con. The advertised price of the flight I am trying to book is $783.00 ""total amount payable incl. fees"" but when I get to the payment page, if despite that fact that the cost to pay by visa debit is apparently ""$0.00"" the price goes up by $70. I have phoned three times to get to the bottom of this. One lady told me the original price was a discounted price only if you pay with a maestro card. when I queried why this was not stated anywhere on the website and that that was surely false advertising she hung up. The other two attempts at calling have hung up as soon as I have explained my complaint without even giving me a response. Unacceptable"
The only way to fight this crooked company is by continuos blogging and talking about their horrible rip off actions. Sooner or later this will hurt them enough to stop or go out of business. Here is one of their phone numbers to their management which you should also pester to get action. *34-911160765

"'service which appears to include seat selection and baggage but actually includes nothing.' followed by 'I am currently seeking legal advice as I believe this to be a deliberate provision of misleading information provided to consumers' Save your time, money and energy. Seat selection and potential baggage charges are set by the airline; whether one bothers to read the details or not is up to the individual, and failing to do so isn't a matter for the law-talking guys. 'The only way to fight this crooked company is by continuos blogging and talking about their horrible rip off actions' Nope. There is a fairly effective way to put the frighteners on dire companies such as these, but I doubt the action will be taken.Much more useful would be if no one used this company's services for a week. Seven days of not so much as a booking for a walk across the road and they'd be crying like babies - but that's never going to happen. Unwitting people or those who are convinced there are bargains to be had will search for 'cheap air fares' and click through to this lot, and the outcomes will remain the same."

"I can't believe your service is unbelievable!!! U continue to lie and the only solution to this problem is to buy a ticket double price, wile u continue publish the cheap price and to show there are 7 seats available...To sum it.. people don't book with travelgenio!!!!"
"I totally agree!Many of us have had the same experience!DO NOT BOOK WITH TRAVELGENIO!And do not be fooled by their responses on this forum - they imply that they have some standards of customer care, when they do not. In spite of their concerned posturing on this forum, they will tell you that there is still nothing that they can do (when they eventually reply) when you contact them.I found that booking with the airline direct was cheaper and the baggage was significantly cheaper.I no longer use Skyscanner or Momondo after being ""had"" by Travelgenio."
Dear Cherry;All information about your booking issue is already in your email.Respond to the last email.Thank you.
"My response from Travelgenio after their implying that they were looking into my case on this forum - from a couple of months ago:Dear Mrs S, Thank you for your email and the provided information.First of all, we do apologize for the inconvenience this situation have caused to you, however as we have kindly informed you previously, the service pack is a not refundable service.You can check the infomation related published on the web site;…travelgenio.com/pages/travelgenio-terms-and…On the other hand, we have not made any charge on your credit card no authorized previously. We cannot refund any service properly informed, accepted and paid.On the other hand, the prices given are the airline's prices. Travelgenio only charge for these services, the service pack which corresponds with the travel agency fees for managing the special request.We remain at your disposal.Best regards,GemaUser Satisfaction AgentTravelgenio.com & Travel2be.com"
"The ""service pack"" paid for included, in writing, amongst other services, being able to choose your seats. What this apparently meant was that you could contact Travelgenio and they would arrange for prebooked seats - but you had to pay more than the airline would charge for this, presumably because Travelgenio were charging for the service. So, I have no idea what I received for this inappropriately named service pack. They would not refund me as they said that it was clear what I was paying for - but in fact, the implied services and the costs of them were not at all clear."
"Being cynical... these companies have to make money somehow. Their people have rent and mortgages to pay and food to put on the table. Given that the airlines don't provide them with discounts and there is no magical cheap airfare fairy, how else would you propose they get their money? And it would be ""inferred"" services wouldn't it?"
"""I no longer use Skyscanner or Momondo ""Well that is a silly position to take because there is nothing wrong with either of them if used for their TRUE purpose - to search for flights."
"My worst experience ever. I put in the correct passenger name. However, due to a character limitation the last three letters were cut off. When realising this I asked for the name to be changed. Despite me chasing them every day it took two weeks to receive an email where they asked me for the correct name and which I replied immediately. The next day they told me that they have not received my e-mail. It looks like I loose my money and I have to book another flight..."
"Travelgenio is fraudulent:, stay away from it!!!We booked a flight to Beirut and the price showed as 550 EUR, the web page reported the credit card would go through, then they added secretly 50 EUR for ""verification of the card"" and then upon our reconfirming, they charged us 600 EUR and in the confirming email was no indication of this 50 extra, just showed the total of 600. We called and cancelled the flight but they charged us 30 EUR for cancelling which is also illegal.May this help others... it is a huge nuissance and is in fact fraud...H & O"

I called and paid €210 euros to change a flight I'd already booked. The next day I get a call saying I have to pay €94 more if I want that flight. No offer of absorbing the cost themselves for the kistake they made. I even suggested it and was told no. The woman on the phone was nice and did offer a refund but by that point I had already planned around the flight I had booked and (as far as I was concerned) paid for. It very much felt like them not taking responsibility for their own mistake. Supervised also refused to get on the phone with me leaving the sales assistant to deal with it. Terrible management and bad way to treat customers. AVOID.

"Hi, better to avoid travelgenio. The on-line experience is OK but the customer service is poor. They charge additional service to book specific seat but actually they do not book it. The fee is just for them to send you another email and ask you to pay another 20euros to get actual seat booking. The mail went in the spam and when I asked a refund of the not provided service, they replied (Mounia) that the 20euros are charge as they sent me the email to ask confirmation....Edited: 3 years ago "

More nonsense which paints them in a bad light :-)

"Hi Gruppiger, please tell us your booking code or send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check the service pack petition made. Regards"
"Yes, I paid for the service pack too. I have no idea what you are supposed to get for this - basically nothing! It is so misleading - the description included choice of seats - implying that you will be able to choose your seats if you pay the service charge? No? ... Apparently not! It would appear that you pay this for the Travelgenio staff to book your seats for you - for which you have to pay more than the airline charges. It is so much simpler, and cheaper, to go direct to the airline for your tickets and seats. Communicating with Travelgenio is via an expensive phone line, as they are not good at answering your emails. Eventually, they will reply saying we can't refund what you agreed to pay - see terms and conditions; but they do not answer your questions as to what you actually get for the service pack. Watch this space! They will probably post on here telling you to contact them directly so that they can sort it out for you - but you will just get another generic response offering no explanation and not really making much sense!"
Ha! As I predicted - a very quick public communication from Travelgenio asking you to make direct contact - attempting to imply to others that their customer service is good!
Hi JackieS1163 if you need further info regarding the conditions of the service pack we will be pleased to assist you. Please contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com or tell us your booking code and we will check your petition. Regards
Book direct with airline.

"Been there! Done that! To no avail!Travelgenio, please do not waste your and my time pretending that you have high standards of customer care!"
"A global frequent traveller would recognise who they are paying their money to, and it would NOT have been Tripadvisor."
"Yes, had to pay heap extra for luggage that should have been included. Customer service atrocious."
"Jannick H, it sound slike you should quit trying to use third party booking sites altogether, and just go directly to the airline sites."
"Updated post: I wanted to check Travelgenio before a booking at them here from Sweden for a flight from China to India, due I have still so much problems with Bravofly.(anycountry or com) by getting money back from their DOUBLE BOOKING website ( IT SEEMS TO BE A SMART TRICK BY SPANISH & ITALIAN FLIGHT TICKET SALES COMPANIES) They did first write me i could not get the payment through due price on flight had changed in meantime. I needed to rebook they wrote me - I did that rebook and pay it, after which they send me a confirmation on a draw and another draw of first failed payment. The first was more expensive than the new(strange). Anyway i found out it was an Italian company standing by BRAVOFLY with an Spanish HQ - and after 2 years & super many emails back and forward and no responses, and no phone or contact person to call - i got ONLY 50% returned - my son litterely had 2 seats in same flight to Portugal and home same day ! What can You LEARN ??? - always check on the net the 2 words: ""Problem"" & ""thecompanyname"" and see what pops up.Always try to use direct the provider - or an ticket office INSIDE Your Country - if the price is about same - only way you can get your money back.Due to the Spain and Italy mafia company RUMBO GROUP i will not dare to use also Travelgenio, sad but the flue spreads - and on this blog it seems they like DOUBLE BOOKINGS TOO.!Note i will not respond on comments ! Just take this as trustfull info from a global frequent traveler."
Also check that your ticket provider can be reach by phone!HINT:If they do not have a phone you can ring them on without waiting 2 days - Then only way is to start a fake trial booking & make some trouble & ask them to call you on their chat frame or e-mail or so. Then they call you right away to sell you that fake expensive ticket from maybe LA to Tokyo !Then when you talk with the salesguy ask him for his/her email and number - after which you ask him for bookkeeping phone number in case you need to call them later - then ask for manager's name.& U R Connected!
Or just book with the airline. Much simpler.
"Dear Jannick, we will be pleased to assist you in our Customer Service official ways: you can find our agents through our call center - numbers are available in our sites - or through customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"Your reply here is a hypocritical attempt to hide your real face. When one finally gets to an English-speaking agent, it gets no better. We've booked a ticket in the morning and we still have neither confirmation nor the tickets. When we reach your call centre, they tell us we are supposed to pay some extra, when we pay they tell us we owe you more money. Each call cost me money and they never call back. And after a few calls and another 67 euro paid as an extra charge, I am still waiting for the tickets! At this moment it seems more like a FRAUD!Edited: 2 years ago "
Could you please tell us your booking code to check what happened? We will contact you asap. Regards
"I will tell you what happened. You attract naive travellers showing them lower prices, and when they pay the price, it changes (as if by magic!). The traveller gets nothing until they call you and they pay an extra charge. And now the price is no longer lower (and maybe even higher) than the one with competitors :) Plus the charge for the phone calls to your call centre, the time wasted to get a reply and emotional distress that no one is going to reimburse for.And the previous dozens of comments in this thread show me I am not your first victim. Please don't try to seem thoughtful and caring. I am never ever using your service again :)"
"We will be pleased to check your booking process and find out what happened. Please tell us the mail used or the booking code to identify it. Without that we cannot assist you. If you prefer, you can send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
This never happened with me. Customer Service was hopeless and not at all interested in my complaint nor about the false information on the website. Other customers should save stress and book with someone more reputable.
"Hi Simonltdavidson, we would like to check what happened. Could you please tell us your booking code in order to find out your case? Regards"
Could you please tell us your booking code in order to find out your case?========= Truly incompetent to be requesting booking reference numbers to be posted on an open forum. These details should only ever be requested by a PM or email. But typical of the shoddiness of this company.
"I agree, Kennydon. The responses here by Travelgenio continue to be very unimpressive, and should only serve to undermine them."
All our customers can contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com where our team and agents will be pleased to assist them. Best regards
BEWARE TRAVELGENIO= SCAM ARTISTS!!!!! BEWARE Avoid Travelgenio like the plague!!!!!!!!! I have already been stung for 50€ and am still waiting for 400€. If I do not recover it I WILL be taking legal action against them. They seem to be some shady outfit running out of Spain. I think it's only 2/3 people trying to minimize the damage to their reputation online. Every bad review has some sniffeling reply from Travelgenio.

"This company is running some sort of scam. I booked a flight on the 19th of March from Thira via Prague to London.This flight was for August the 19th.I received emails saying the schedule has changed - but did not act on them (my fault I know). I checked the link on the confirmation email a month and then 24 hours before the flight. Both were showing the flights were confirmed at the original times. I turned up to airport the flights were not there. I called the Travelgenio then, and they were rude and didn't care. Saying we can't help. I think they are based in Spain. The money has not be refunded. They have just held on to it. Underhand!!!! Very dodgy.I called again today - spoke to Joseph, he was rude unhelpful and just hung up on me. PLEASE DO NOT USE THESE GUYS. THEY WILL SCREW YOU OVER."

"OPTION OPEN/FLEXIBLE MENSONGÈRE !!!Ayant souscrit a cette option pour la modique somme de 99 euros et l'ayant déjà utilise chez bon nombre de compagnie aérienne, je me retrouve a devoir avancer mon billet retour de 3 semaines, après avoir passe une journée pour contacter le service client je me retrouve face au fait que l’aller ayant été consommé je ne peux modifier mon billet retour. Cette option usurpe totalement la réelle utilisation du nom OPEN/FLEXIBLE trouvée chez TOUTES les autres compagnies. Au final J'ai paye un aller retour 1002.50euros + 99euros d'option et je ne peux pas changer mon billet retour, vu le prix du changement que l'on m'a communiqué de l'ordre de 400 a 500euros si je suis FLEXIBLE ET OPEN sur les dates ;-) Un billet simple avec la compagnie en direct me coûte le même prix. Assez de payer pour ce manque de professionnalisme, ils doivent deja profiter de mes 500 euros pour essayer de créer une nouvelle option qui vous dépouillera encore plus nouveau client. Fuyez!"

"NEVER book with travelgenio. Knowing that Air Berlin is bankupt, they continued to take bookings from customers before the news of the bankruptcy was public. I was informed ONE MONTH after my flight was cancelled, that it had been cancelled; and that was only because I called the the customer service number (where I lost even more money).So for cheap flights, I'd say you can take your chances, but DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT book with travelgenio if you can help it."
Hi Devika. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"Devika it was public knowledge that Air Berlin were in financial difficulties for some time. This information was available to you too had you googled them. It was your choice in the end to accept flights with them.There were talks of them being sold to another airline or some other deal being done, so they could have continued flying if that had worked out. Do you have proof that yiur OTA actually knew without a doubt they were bankrupt and would fold leaving your flight cancelled?"
"+1 AmoMondo. Some companies ar ein financial difficulties but continue trading and eventually begin to thrive again, perhaps because of things like a restructuring, a refinancing or a buy out. Sometimes it's a combination of thinmgs that helps guide them back to a more robust financial situation.The point is that I don't think it was ever certain that Air Berlin would go bust until they had exhausted all other possibilites and actually gone bankrupt. Up until that point it was anyone's guess as to what would happen. All this was indeed in the public domain, and some would undoubtedly not booked to fly with this airline until things were certain, one way or the other.So, I'm afraid I don't think you can hold the agent responsible just because they sold a ticket. Of course, if they had continued to sell tickets for flights after Air Berlin had announced they had ceased trading, that would be a totally different kettle of fish."
"Travelgenio.comNo service! Don't buy tickets from them, they are lyers. Don't buy any service it's waste of money!! The worst company ever!!!"
"Travelgenio Do you have any customer service? It's 0, nobody responding and taking money for nothing!Your service called ""Personalized service"" it's nothing. I should have luggage and meals with that service as it's written in your rules but I had to pay once more for luggage more 130 EU.Edited: 2 years ago "

I have to second the comments about excessive credit card charges from Travelgenio.I was just charged 32€ for booking 4 flights even though the credit card option boxes said 8€ charge for credit card.It seems they charge the fee per flight.Learn from my mistake.

I would like to thank everyone for their comments about the risk of booking with travelgenio.You have saved me a lot of grief.  Why does Tripadvisor still allow travelgenio to present their unreliable offers on the Tripadvisor website when their fare offers and post-purchase service seem unreliable and worryingly expensive?

"Just like the SMH or Daily Tele, TripAdvisor accepts advertising and takes no responsibility for quality of the products. You need to use due diligence when considering ANY on-line purchases."
"To be honest I must report that Travelgenie refunded the difference for my airfare so it really was the cheapest in the end. For me it still seems worth it to find the cheapest fare and take it, but be VERY careful before you do the final click authorizing payment. Once you have the ticket deal only with the airline."
Also find out your credit card's policy for refunds. A good credit card company does not deal with crooks and protects you in valid disputes.

"I should have checked before buying my ticket from Travelgenio, it seems to be really just a big scam company, as I also chose this ""Personal service"" for additional cost, as I need to have an additional luggage next to the hand luggage and when I received the tickets, no luggage is still allowed, so I just had to pay more for my ticket, that does not actually contain luggage. Their phone number is impossible to call to, no one will answer your call. I would not recommend anyone to buy from this site, total disappointment and head ache."

"***THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO TRAVELGENIO'S REPLY TO THE ORIGINAL POST BACK ON JULY 7 2016***I'm not sure why I didn't get a notification of your response so unfortunately I have only just seen this now. As for the response, I was already in contact with your customer support and it shouldn't take a bad review for a company to rectify an issue. After dealing with you the first time I'm very doubtful anything will change but my booking number was LG4L3K. In addition, if you were actually concerned about fixing the issue you would have seeked me out, as I mentioned in my review I had already been in contact with support and had an email chain that I'm sure would not have been hard to find a Bradley C for around that time. But I guess that is what these companies rely on, people not realizing the company has left a response on their review, and then it looks like the company was trying to do the right thing however the people never know and that's where it end, with no resolution and the company just keeps operating.Edited: 2 years ago "

"Hi Mondial, we were replying last post. Thanks for your comment"
"Yes and it was absolute garbage. I booked a flight through you, you took money out of my account and sent me an itinerary, I then showed up to the airport on the date (6 WEEKS LATER) of the itinerary and I didn't have a flight. BUT YOU STILL HAD MY MONEY. AFTER 6 WEEKS. You didn't send an email to say it was cancelled or offered to refund my money. It was only after coming home and another 2 weeks of back and forth, BEING LIED to (I HAVE PROOF) that the refund process had been started straight away and when I finally made the person send me a copy of the transaction (which took a couple of emails back and forth to get the actual document) it showed that it was started a day before NOT 6 weeks ago. TRAVELGENIO are absolute criminals, I can't understand how they are allowed to stay in business or who regulates them. There headquarters are in Spain so I don't think anyone does which is why they are able to continue to operate like this."
"THere is very little regulation of internet booking sites, except for the laws of whichever countyr they base themselves in. That's part of the reason why I think it's so important to check out where they do business from. At the same time, it's also a very good idea to check out their reputation, and read their terms and conditions. Walk away (or run!) from anything you see that you don't much like."

"Oh dear Travelgenio, you’ve just proven you don’t understand your customers at all as they complained.

You then changed it back.Edited: 2 years ago "
This isn't the first example I've seen of Travelgenio shooting themselves in the foot by posting here.
"Dear Travelgenio, This is really insane. Please read what I have written on post #860 and then reply !!If you are a call center agent just assigned to blindly reply on the posts here then better dont do it. You are not helping to your company's image by doing this at all !"

"Exactly right, Frommy. They are showing their true colours, and it's just a shame that more people don't see their gibberings."
"If I see that ludicrous sentence .... ""Of course we can help you with your booking....."" once more I will scream!!! They have to be joking!!!!"
We recently used Travelgenio and it was a poor experience. They are deliberately difficult to contact in Spain to sort out issues and then hammer your credit card with fees when items aren't your fault. When you do get hold of someone on the phone their customer service is appalling. It usually ends up more expensive in the long runWould recommend avoiding this company altogether and sticking to the more well known online booking agencies
Latest addition to the above - for a short domestic flight within South Africa we just got quoted $450 per person (3 of us) to change the flight to the next day....looking online ourselves dumping our return ticket and buying a fresh new one direct from the airline is $150 per person.....so a deliberate attempt to rip us off it seems with massive markups on simple short domestic flights
>> for a short domestic flight within South Africa we just got quoted $450 per person (3 of us) to change the flight to the next day <<Change fees tend to be dictated by the airline and often consist of a change fee plus a fare difference. Your agent will charge an admin fee on top of this as per their T&Cs (they don't work for free) - their fee is €30 per passenger. What are the airline ticket rules?

Travelgenio is a terrible company..What they do is day time robbery and fraud They take people’s money and you can’t get to themMy flight was cancelled by the airlines and they washed their hands saying that the have nothing to offer Shocking lack of professionalism One person shouted one me and hang up on me.. I was given conflicting information by different people .. hard to know who to believe.. one of them told me his the manger when I asked to speak to one.. later another person told me that there was no manager on the floor today so the first person was obviously lying..I contacted the airlines who advised me to legally sue them..Not to mention the waiting time on very expensive calls and they can easily hang up after 20 min waiting Terrible stressful experience I lost my money and now I will have to issue a new ticket last minuet Just a fraud nothing else Please don’t use this rubbish company to let them robbe you

"Travelgenio is a fraud!!!!This company is a fraud!!! This company is a fraud!!!! I will press for legal charges against them, thankfully I had my wits together recording my calls to the service desk so I have sufficient proof. I checked online for flight rates to Nairobi, they were somewhat cheaper than BA, except for the fact that when adding the credit card payment as the payment option, the cost of the flight increased by approx. 75€. So I did not finish the booking process and booked directly with BA. 10 minutes later I received an email from travelgenio that the booking was confirmed! I called the service desk 3 times, they spoke poor English but I speak Spanish as well, as soon as the word ""cancellation"" fell from my side, the connection was broken from their end. I then informed American Express immediately since I expected fraud, we agreed to wait for another day to see if there would be any addl confirmation of the eticket which I did not receive. In the end, I had two bookings. I will keep you posted on how the legal process goes, but clearly, they use the cookies on their website to substract the credit card information, even though not confirmed. So watch out for these crooks!!!!!!!"

"My wife has booked flights to Cyprus at the end of March 2018 using Travelgenio before she read the reviews. The money has gone out and we are in receipt of a booking form with a Booking reference number etc and it says e ticket on the e mail.Is this all we need or do I need to go into panic mode, write this off as a BIG mistake and book direct with the airline?.My wife is distraught at the moment so do I just bite the bullet and spend another £400 for another return ticket direct with the airline?"
"Go to the airline website, 'Manage my booking' and enter the booking reference number which, hopefully is not the Travelgenio number, and check the details of you flight. If it shows up as booked you are probably OK, but continue to monitor the airline site to watch for any flight changes which Travelgenio may forget to advise you of."
"<<My wife is distraught at the moment so do I just bite the bullet and spend another £400 for another return ticket direct with the airline?>>No. Let's not go over the top here. As Frommy says, check on the airline website, if you can see your ticket. Please also check what is your luggage allowance etc. Some cheap tickets are hand luggage only. If that should be the case, buy the luggage you need.And then check around every fortnight, if there are any changes in your flight schedule. That is a healthy routine, which should be done for every ticket (also if you buy directly from the airline).You did not buy scam tickets. It is just you bought from a third party. So as long as there are not any changes, things should work out."

Goodness - avoid this company unless you are absolutely 100% sure of your flights.My younger brother just booked with these guys yesterday and realised that the flights didn't actually work for him after booking. The flights are with Norwegian and their cancellation policy is 24 hours if flying to the US with a full refund. This bunch of fools however have said that because he didn't contact them until the next day to change (within the 24 hours) there was nothing they could do and he couldn't get a refund. I would encourage everyone to book direct with an airline in future - silly crappy companies like this are not worth giving your money to.
"Yes ChrisRussell....we know! There are almost 1000 posts on this one thread alone about how bad travelgenio are.But don't worry, they will come along some time soon with their stock answer ""Of course we can help you with your booking.....""!!!! They won't have even read your post properly as it is their stock answer.Good luck!Edited: 2 years ago "
">> The flights are with Norwegian and their cancellation policy is 24 hours <<those are the cancellation terms for those customers that book direct with Norwegian (most other airlines offer free 24 hour cancellation also)As your brother booked through an agent, he will need to refer to the cancellation terms of that agent - many of them offer no free cancellationBest to assume that all agency flights are non-refundable and check the dates/times are good before booking rather than after"
"Hi Chris, of course we can help you with the booking cancellation. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking reference and telling us if you want to cancel all the booking or just a part and we will inform you about the rate conditions for your request. Take into account that cancellations depend on the airline and ticket rules, the one accepted during the booking process. Regards"
"""Take into account that cancellations depend on the airline and ticket rules, the one accepted during the booking process.""You didn't read Chris's complaint at all did you? His whole point is that you did NOT adhere to the cancellation policy of the airline."
"The airline policy when purchasing through a third party is shown during the booking process. If the ticket rule because of the fare selected is non refundable, we cannot authorised it unless airline gives us a special order for it. If he needs assistance, he can contact us in the mail providen and we will give him all the info and details regarding the ticket and allowances for it. Regards"
What did I tell you Chris??!! The usual bog-standard reply and they didn't read your post!Edited: 2 years ago 
"If assistance is needed, please proceed by writting to our customer service mail. They will inform them about the ticket allowances they purchased. Regards"
"Sorry to be out of topic actually. Seems this ended up about travelgenio only which I know nothing about, but I can say that as many times I've booked from airtickets.com, never had any problem with them. They've been active for more than 10 years in Greece, I never had any problem and they are considered a legitimate agent in general."
"It appears all is well, at the moment, for my booking after checking with the actual Airline helpdesk, fingers crossed!Thank you for contacting us. Regarding your request, we wish to inform you that the payment for the tickets with the booking number ****** was confirmed. If you would like to find out more details about the booking, please visit our web site at the mannage section using this reservation code ****** and a email adress. For more information, please do not hesitate to contact us via a new contact form (https://www.blueairweb.com/en/gb/contact/) or via our Call Center Department (https://www.blueairweb.com/en/gb/contact/ and select the country where you are)."
"Russ999rocket thanks for your comment. If you need support, please contact us and our team will assist you. Best regards"
"Yep, just done exactly that. Rang them..... I can choose my seat free on the blue air website... No I can't take baggage without paying the airline. So what did I pay £20 for then? ""service pack is for agents only"" she said.... Well don't let punters tick a box and buy it then. False advertising.Never using travelgenio again and will spread far and wide."
"Dear Aaaaaancly, if you need any further info regarding the service pack terms and conditions you can contact us in customer.service@travelgenio.com and also check them in our site, where all the details are published. Regards"
"Yes, I wasted my money on a scam. I have moved on."
I purchased a ticket on travelgenio.com for 573.24 EUROBut after pressing PURCHASE the price changed to 624.08 EURand they dont want to cancel the ticket.I bought meany tickets online. This is the first time this happened. They are a FRAUDEdited: 2 years ago 
Never go with them.they are mislead to customers.my flight was wellington to singapore and in my confirmation email there is nothing written regarding stop of Australia but when I go for boarding they said u can't fly as you DON'T have Australian transit visa.I showed them my ticnet they said no the agent mislead you.they didn't give full information.And when I talked to travelgenio regarding this they said that's your responsibility to get visa but how can I know as it didn't mentioned in my confirmation email.at the end they didn't refund me.I have got all the emails or proof if anybody wanna see.So never never never book a ticket from travelgenio.

UPDATETravelgenio confirmed that they will pay me back 50.48EUR in 24 -48 hrs(this is only because i had proof a screenshot of the original cheaper price)Edited: 2 years ago 
"Aron. ""Of course"" you will get your money back in 24-48 hours! Good luck with that. Let us know if you get it!"
You shouldn't have to post on TripAdvisor to get a response. 9 out of ten emails resulted in a blank reply within minutes.
"Aaaaancly...I wholeheartedly agree with you. It seems as if the only way to get any sort of response at all is to post on here....and that is usually a last resort. Then travelgenio come back with their bog standard, banal reply and don't even read the posts properly."
"Do not book at Travelgenio, it is a provider whose business model is built on withholding cost information before completing the booking. They charge hidden service and credit card fees that are not displayed beforehand. In my case the final price suddenly was 20% higher than initially displayed before pushing the ""purchase"" button. It's appalling and I wonder how a firm with such an anachronistic and unethical business model can survive in the market. Please do not make the mistake using Travelgenio!"
"Hi 73Maik, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the charges and price of the selected ticket and services if added. Regards"
"Don't worry 73Maik! Of course they will be able to help you! Having said that, they survive because sad to say, people like your good self keep using them despite the thousands of warning out there. Good luck."
"Maybe they can even convince you that they are not unethical or anachronistic, but I have my doubts ;-)"

"I booked a ticket this morning from Auckland to Johannesburg on Travel2be the money is deducted from my account but the ticket is cancelled by them, no reason given, they have no email address on their site, i tried to call them number of times as i am based in south africa, it costs me too much to make an international call, all this is very unnecessary in first place. when i call the customer services, no body wants to pick up the phone, one guy finally picks up the phone and says ""we all busy call later"" what kind of service is this? whats going to happen to my money now? I want the money right away or the ticket. this is very frustrating....first time in my life i am so frustrated with a booking web site.Edited: 2 years ago "
"with many third party sites you are not 'booking', you are requesting that they book for you at the price they showed. Sometimes they can and sometimes they can't (fare not available) sometimes they contact the passenger and ask for more money, other times they just cancel. You will find similar poor/non existent 'service' with many online ticket floggersIt may be a hold on the funds that will drop off in 48 hours but I would speak to your bank / card company to confirm"
"Does it mean the funds will be in my account within 48 hours automatically. I have contacted the bank and notified as this is a SCAM website because i never experienced this kind of service. I have requested them to reverse the payment if they can. This looks like real fake business to me without caring customers needs and emotions. what if someone want to travel urgently to attend someone's funeral....whats gonna happen, the money is blocked for 48 hours....is that what it is?Edited: 2 years ago "

"If they wanted to travel urgently, or otherwise, they would book with the airline if they had any sense. It is NOT a scam website, just a very bad one."
I am sorry but i dont see a business sense here....why would u in first place allow passengers to book tickets if you as a business owner not sure about the tickets confirmation. Yes people will book tickets if they are cheap and available on any site... why mislead people
"<<allow passengers to book tickets if you as a business owner not sure about the tickets confirmation>>You do not understand. They do not book at ticket. They reserve your money and then try to get a ticket for the money they have quoted.<<i dont see a business sense here>> They get a lot of people who are chasing <<tickets if they are cheap>>They do not have live pricing. So once they have your money, then they go shopping.And the ""cheap"" ticket can be cobbled together or be indirect etc. Question back to you. What is the interest of the airline to have an agent between them and the customer? That was important to sell in times before the internet. But today???<<why mislead people>> Well, they do exactly what they have told you they will do in their T&C's you have accepted.The problem really is that people see a ""cheap"" price, and click, click buy. No reading of T&C's, no understanding that they appoint an agent, no checking with whom they enter business with, no check how to reach them, no nothing really. And if you complain about low quality customer service, did you check the quality of customer service or did you expect to pay 'cheap' for tickets and get 'premium' on customer service?As a tip. This thread is soon reaching 1000 posts. So the warnings have been out there, big time.And last but not least. They are fully legal. Shonky but legal. Buyer beware. Sorry, but you are an adult and responsible for your actions.Edited: 2 years ago "
I am sure you read terms and conditions on everything you buy in your life.....this is complete nonsense....and cheating..... do you read terms and conditions on the toothpaste you buy.....cheap tricks to play with people's emotions....why take money first then go shop....why not shop first then take money......so you dont know for yourself that you can get the cheaper ticket....so why cheat people and block their money? Utter nonsense
"Do I read T&C's on things costing very little? NoDo I read T&C's on services I have no choice but with a good reputation (upgrade of Apple software on phone)? No.Do I read contractual obligations with new companies before a pay them a larger amount of money? Yes, every time.You can be angry with me, the world and this third party. But first and foremost you should be angry with yourself of being negligent. And if you were, you would be learning and not repeating this mistake another time."
"Just to hammer it in, with the hope you learn something.<<why take money first then go shop....why not shop first then take money>> Because you allowed them to do so by accepting the T&C's. And this way they make more money."
Hi prasadthutta of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards
Thanks but i am not here to learn lessons....i am a customer and there are 100s are customers like me not happy with the way this website operates....you can check the reviews if you want.....if one customer is not satisfied its the problem with the customer....if 100s are not satisfied....change your business model....i dont expect you to agree with me....but unfortunately customer is always right...if its not for customer change it.....but anyway thanks for your time.... hope there will be little transparency in future if not you will get these kind of nasty customers and mails every now and then.... Good Luck
"<<you will get these kind of nasty customers and mails every now and then>>You wrote post 950 on this thread alone. Do you really think they care?Their business model sadly works brilliantly. And thanks to the internet, they will continue to grow because there are enough people spending the money first and then only start to think."
Good Luck to them and Good luck to you as well ....all the best
"If you need any further information or assistance, we will be pleased to help you in the mail above mentioned. Best regards"
prasadthutta.....what a pity YOU didn't check the reviews!!!!!! We know not to use this dreadful third party to book tickets. There are hundreds and hundreds of complaints on here about travelgenio but it didn't stop you booking through them.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Hi,Thank you for your response, I been travelling around world from last 25 years extensively, always booked tickets through Third party sites, never and never in my life my ticket was cancelled without informing me, and never and never had such a dreadful customer service like Travel2be. Thats when it triggered me to go and see the reviews otherwise i was not bothered to check the reviews at all. coz i was never in a situation to check reviews before, never experienced such thing in my entire life.Anyway thanks for your timeHave a good one"
"Hello, Thervel2be and Travelgenio are the same company and they are not legid. I booked a ticket with them and the flight never took place and told me they would refund me. I have been calling and emailing for 1 year now and they are simply ignoring the messages, complaints. They are a fraud company with completely incapable customer service. I advice strongly, you give your business to other companies."

"I have just booked two tickets for Westjet flights from New York to London through Travelgenio. Reading the messages here I wish I had booked direct with Westjet. There was no way I could book for my check-in luggage before I paid. I did read that with 'Personalized Service' I could order extra luggage allowance, so I paid extra for that Service. I have now received my ticket confirmation, including zero luggage allowance, and I still can see no way to book for the luggage. Can anyone help with this? (Haven't found a telephone number for Travelgenio yet...)"
"Dave. You'll be fine! The travelgenio rep on here will be along very shortly with their stock reply that starts with the platitude ""Of course we can help with......"". Good luck!"
Hi Dave Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts regarding the service pack service and we will answer you asap with the terms and conditions of it in order to help you. Regards
Travel genio booked us 4 flights that didn't exist. We turned up to the airport to be told the airline didn't have any knowledge of our booking number that Travelgenio gave us.We had to buy 4 new flights on the spot at double the price.Travelgenio will only refund our original amount in several months.Do not ever use Travelgenio.
What do you mean the flights didn’t exist? Which flights did you book? Leading up to the flight didn’t you keep an eye on your flights on the airlines own website by attempting to go into Manage my Booking and enter the passenger number and your surname and see your flights listed? Not a wise idea to just turn up at the airport and assume everything is ok.Booking on an airlines own website and managing your booking is usually the best idea.
"Hi michaelbarclay75, please send us all the details regarding your booking to customer.service@travelgenio.com. We will check your tickets status and contact you with all the information. Thanks"
"Hi Travelgenio,I have just contacted your customer care but have not received a response. I have also been charged €120 extra for no reason, reading these reviews I see it is the ""card charge"". I thought that this was illegal and also why is your website charging for seats and meals when the airlines give them for free? Do I now have to pay to get a meal and choose my seats? Regards"
"Hi shelleymoloney,Why did you not do some research as to whom you were throwing you money at before booking what you thought to be a 'cheap' flight?"
"Hi Shelly, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"shelly, you will probably get a bot like reply saying that of course Travelgenio can help you with your payment concerns if you get in touch, but putting that aside, contact your provider and tell them that you have been charged more than you agreed to.You may, of course, discover that you have agreed to an extra charge somewhere, for that's how outfits like this make enough profit to stay in business. That might well be the answer to your second question as well. As to your third question, I'd guess the answer will be 'yes'."
Travelgenio should be AVOIDED at all costs. I highly recommend using another service! I personally have had very bad experiences with this provider.

You guys haven't even replied.How long does it take to reply ??
"Today I bought a ticket with Travelgenio, the price is shown 712.88 Euro including taxes. until finishing the purchase it didn't show any other charge. and as long as I finished buying my ticket, I found that they charged my debit card extra 70 euro!.i call customer care, they said there is a service charge. Surprisingly, they told me the ticket price is 756 euro which is completely out of blue because I kept the snapshot of the price they offered I selected. I spent more than 3 hours since I bought the ticket, they could not offer me any solution. moreover, the original airlines' ticket for the same flight is less than what I am paying now. Very much frustrating! Will appreciate any suggestion, please."
"""Will appreciate any suggestion, please.""Research who you are about to throw money at in future before before doing so. The previous 978 posts before yours are not compliments on how great they are. Apart from that, you are stuffed."

"No way to contact travelgenio is by email or telephone.I used Facebook in a different way, but when everyone got an answer, I didn't get any reply, so I was blocked for no reason. Because my name is Korean and I am not good at English ...Don't expect anything from these dirty racists.Everyone needs to avoid these fraudsters for a happy trip.For a few euros, don't go through a few days."

Could you tell us your booking code to track your petitions?
"Travelgenio, don't try to solve this problem with me.I'm already tired. I don't want to exchange questions with your macros anymore.I don't need any refund or compensation.Just keep it with you.I'm not taking the flight you reserved, and I'm going to book again elsewhere.To this point1. We can not contact you by any route, such as Travelgenio, customer service, email, etc.- All messages are completely ignored.2. Contact us through Facebook- All messages are completely ignored.- I asked you to confirm your email with your reservation code but it was blocked today.3. Travelgenio began to respond when he wrote on the forum.- You want me to give you a code?4. I'm more unhappy.I don't want to be in front of people.Nevertheless, the reason I came to this open forum to write is because they blocked me from Facebook.I wanted them to know fantastic customer service.If you are to become a respected and beloved travel agent, do not create another victim.When others use the travel agency, they want to get better treatment.Finally, look for the damn booking code in your Facebook or at the ' Customer service ' of your site, and answer them all. (I don't need it anymore!)Do not ask anyone who is angry like me again ; it is your business.I don't mind now, I just need to find a new ticket, and I'm going to spend the rest of my life serving the human race so that victims like me don't come from you.I won't answer any more."

"Don´t trust this Travelgenio as a travelagent! They are not to be trusted! This is my review and my experience with Travelgenio. They have the worst email service and callcenter service. It is impossible to get hold of them. They don´t answer email and I am not exaggerating I been cut off more than 5 times over the phone while waiting. They don´t want to help. The worst thing is as well my flight got changed twice, first I have to travel one day early loosing out on one day of work, will travelgenio reimburse for that? And the second flight on my way home I have to wait for over 9h for my connection flight, without any compensation. My advice is to don´t use this company as they scam you and offer the worst service ever."
Hi KimTitan of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards
"KimTitan, it's probably better if you don't regard any online booking site as a travel agent. You'll just have unrealistic expectations about the level of service you receive.Many of us here will say that it's even better to just book direct with the airline."
"Flight were canceled. TRAVELGENIO warn you 2 days later by mail !... with no further excuses, compensation, or any proposal.Go to the company site itself... Let's say: Get lost !One phone number, in Spain !!!Good luck ! For me this is the first and last time.Thierry"

"Hi Sardia and travelgenio.com,I had almost the SAME MISERABLE EXPERIENCE dealing with their medical cancellation policy. I had an appendectomy performed and had to cancel my flight because I was unable to travel. I though I’d be fine because I bought insurance and submitted a signed doctors note, his contact information, along with my medical records indicating I was hospitalized and operated on. I was wrong. After an hour on the phone with an employee named Nicolas, he Insisted I needed a stamp as well on my documents. Let me tell you, my father is a surgeon and we have no such stamps in the USA. When I went to my surgeon’s office, they didn’t have a stamp and neither did the hospital where I had my surgery. My mom and I patiently explained this to Nicolas multiple times, but he was extremely rude and insisted that they’ve handled medical claims before and we simply needed to look harder. We offered alternate forms of records, to put them in contact with my surgeon, as well as a photo of me and my surgeon with my scars. I have still yet to figure out how to find a stamp or viable substitute and I’m being robbed by this company. No such stamps exist in the USA and the company hasn’t helped me at all find a way to resolve this problem."

Well I’d remove your last post as posting your email address on a public forum is a seriously bad idea.Why did you expect top notch service? Did you pay a significant premium over the Airline’s price for booking direct to get this type of service? Or did you look for cheap and somehow think that would mean they’d have enough of a margin to invest in stellar service?

That's true! Travelgenio one of the worst airlines ticketing company should be closed by authority where they are now! A ultimate the best SCAMMERS in the world! We announced ceo of travelgenio Mr. Mariano pelizzari-please kindly bear with us
"I justi noticed that one of the discussions about Travelgenio warnings has been removed from Trip Advisor. My advice to all the people who are researching Travelgenio or just want to see what others have been through, look at the other discussion. Yes this company is the worst I have ever dealt with. And yes they need to be investigated and for the public good... shut down. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS COMPANY TO BOOK TICKETS. You will be taking a huge risk.Edited: 2 years ago "
And ignore all their requests for you to contact them to sort things out. You will get absolutely nowhere and find yourself on the verge of a breakdown. There is only one answer and that is to have them shut down until they give a legal commitment to run their operation in the interests of their customers. Despite all the negative publicity they have received... nothing has changed. People continue to be burnt. Surely the better way to stay afloat is have a good reputation. Not hide your mistakes and squirm out of reimbursing customers. Fix your mistakes. They wont though.
Travelgenio is the one most scammers in the worldPlease kindly bear with us Mr. Mariano Pelizzano..CEO of travelgenio. A lot of client's complaints hard uncluding me! From the management we don't recieve any compliment solve problem at your company! OLease travelgenio fix this all!
"Hi Hazel, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Travelgenio please give my 80% of my money! And 20% of the rest my money it goes for donation fir the CEO and staff's! Just turn it back my money! Bear with us travelgenio
Could you tell us your booking code to track your case and contact you back please?
"Hello, Travelgenio and Travel2be are the same company and they are corrupted. All the bed reviews on this forum was on this company. I do not have experience with the other one you listed."
"You can start refunding everybody you stole money from! there you go, information for my case: [Travelgenio SL #1700289] Your booking 2YZO2DContact me asap!!!"
Yes I had similar experienced. They are very very bad customer service. They made me waiting over 20 minutes even overseas phone call and hang up my overseas phone call 4 times so I need pay overseas phone call fee almost 40 minutes. Also they reply me that if cancel flight ticket pay 30EURO only but there is no limit date only limit time till 11:00PM Spain local time they wrote foremore they sent me next mail is cancel fee 30EURO plus penalty fee 85EURO. hahaha. This terrible company is formal swindler so please do not use this fool company. Please do not useTravelgenio.com & Travel2Be.com
"Cancellations follow the ticket and airline policy, the one accepted during the booking process. If you want us to check once more the ticket restrictions and possibilities for that please tell us your booking code. Regards"
"I’m travelling at least 50 times annually. I booked a flight with travelgenio. They charged my credit card and the whole procedure was as common as in other websites. On the day of the flight, I arrived at the airport and got informed from the airline, that I never had a booking for my flight. I called travelgenio and they informed me that there was a mistake in their system, so they had to cancel my flight, off course they never refound me the charge to my cc. They were simply waiting for me to call them, having me a hold for long time, until they just answer that, although their mistake, it’s my fault, not contacting them at least two day prior to my flight date. Creepy company and the customer service has a stupid guideline on which way to treat disappointed customers."
"Hi Palama, of course we can help you with your booking details. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will check what happened answer you asap. Regards"
"We have used Travelgenio in 2016, whilst travelling in South America and the process went through without a hitch and more recently Brisbane to Chiang Mai and return. I was concerned at first given that we didn't receive an E Ticket, when l phoned the company, the lady assisting was able to confirm a misspelling in our email address (as per information supplied by me to online purchase) as the reason and 5 minutes later the E Ticket forwarded to the correct email address. Thanks Travelgenio"
Thanks for rating your experience with us Onthewallaby5355. Our goal is our customers satisfaction. Regards
<<Our goal is our customers satisfaction. >>So why are there so many complaints about your company?
Don't ever book with travelgenio/travel2be same low life company. Cancelled my flight. Didn't inform me. Left me stranded. Then had the gall to try and charge me for it.
"Do not book on Travelgenio/travel2be. The airlines cancelled the flight. They didn't inform me. They din't help me get a new flight. They had the gall to charge me for a a cancelled flight. I am currently challenging this practice with my credit card. They also do not have a physical address to take them to court, so they must be hiding lots of despicable practices."
Hi John Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. You can also find all our info and registrations in our site. Regards
Hi TravelgenioIt appears you DIDN'T advise John about his cancelled flight.Perhaps you could explain why you didn't.
Travelgenio.Too late as usual! John doesn't need to be advised of new flights now because he was stranded at the airport as you did NOT inform him that you had cancelled his flight. READ THE POSTS!!!!!!!!! Your bog standard reply does NOT apply in this case.
"I by mistake booked a ticket from Cablanca to Istanbul; turkey. While trying to change the dates I concelled the flight because of poor region internet. I paid about 425 euros. I called and emailed many times to find a solution, but they told that my ticket is not refundable and can not be even rebooked. This did not make my date. I am so upset. I feel I am robbed. I calculated and found that I deserve to be refunded about an amount pf 100 euros. but they told me my ticket conditions don""t allow to be refunded. I can not Imagine working hard to save that money and suddenly I found myself with no money and no fight and no solution due to uncontrolled mistakes. the travelgenio shoud find solutions to cases such as this one, otherwise I consider this experience a nightmare vtravelgenio :(Edited: 2 years ago "
"Hi baddouomar2017, of course we can help you with your booking rate conditions and restrictions for your petition, the ones accepted during the booking process. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Avoid Travelgenio, the website is misleading, adding costs right at the end. Customer service is awful, rude and unhelpful. I strongly advise avoiding this company."
Alice. You are a bit late getting to this party!!!! Try reading some of the other 1000 posts on here!
Hi Alice K. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards
"Hilarious, as Alice made no mention of any particular issue here and just wanted to tell everyone to aovid Travelgenio as far as I can see."
Too true RojBlake.Alice hasn't asked for any help from Travelgenio. They just look more and more ridiculous every time they post their useless replies! TRAVELGENIO......READ THE POSTS!!!!!!!Edited: 2 years ago 
Why take chances. Book on the airlines official sites.
"Do not book with trevalgenio... We booked flights with them for homeymoon, we missed the out of d flight as we had a family issue and rebooked for the next day. They cancelled our return flights without notice, were impossible to get through to and we're no help at all.. stay away from them!! Kept out money of course.."
"Any time you miss a leg of a flight the remainder of the ticket is cancelled, and this is standard practice with ALL airlines so, although I hate to say this, the horrible travelgenio are probably innocent in this instance."
"Hi Jossier555, we would like to check what happened with the bookings you talk about. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Definitely not worth the risk! This thread alone has over 1000 posts warning against using them. Try reading some!Edited: 1 year ago 
Anybody who finds this thread (and possibly the others warning about this company) and STILL considers booking with this company is beyond help.
"Hi Lilijana81, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
">>Not sure if it’s worth taking the risk for $100 difference from original flight sites.<<How completely stupid do you have to be?!The BANK - your bank! - realised these are shonkies and blocked. There are thousands of reviews telling you all about how shonky they are. And yet you're still considering going with them for a mere $100 difference.There's no helping stupidity, I guess."

I am flying through Travelgenio next week and i added the personalised service. what exactly will i get for this?
"Hi, if you need any information regarding the terms and conditions of the service contracted, please send us a mail with all your doubts to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will help you. Regards"
what exactly will i get for this?In reality: nothing.
I'd say that getting anything useful out of Travelgenio is as rare as rocking horse droppings.

Yes I already sent an email to customer.service@travelgenio.comPlease confirm.Thanks
Could you tell us your booking code to track it?
Here is my booking code.5M9PVGThanks
Very irresponsible Travelgenio asking one of your victims to post their booking reference on a public forum. You clearly don’t care about data privacy or protection. Anyone with malicious intent can now access this booking now.
"Hi,I paid more money and booked my ticket that could be changeable later (open ticket).So I asked travelgenio to postpone my returning flight ticket but they said,""We inform you that insurance open ticket is possible to use only untill 48 hours prior the first flight in your itinerary. It is not possible to use for partially used tickets.""But as I remenber, when I booked the ticket, there was no mention of 48 hours prior the first flight ticket in my itinery. And in the conditions from the homepage what I read was ""just 48 hours prior the flight"". And finally Travelgenio told me that, to change the flight, I have to pay 94 EUR penalty + 30 EUR service fee and an extraamount for the fare difference.So I'm really disappointed about this, does anybody has a same situation likd me? Will be appreciated for any advice."
"Hi Nora, of course we can help you with the management of your flex ticket.

You also have the conditions here: …travelgenio.com/pages/… in the FLEXIBLE TICKETOpen-date Ticket section. Regards"
DO NEVER BOOK VIA TRAVELGENIO. My flight was cancelled three months ago and I am still arguing with them to get my money back..
"Hi Alekos, of course we can help you with your booking rembursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times.

Don't use them. My booking didn't process properly despite showing as booked on their website. They didn't inform me of any issue. This happened twice and when I called they refuse to help. Now the flights are of course very expensive.

"'have tried to contact you regarding seat selection' Stop doing this.Travelgenio can request seats from the airline - and charge a fee to do so - but that's all they do. Depending on the ticket type they offered and you accepted, you may not be able to select seats until the day of travel. Check the status of your booking at the airline's website; if the information about seating isn't available there then call the airline.After you travel, ensure you never go near the Travelgenio website again. Never."
"Thank you very much. My emails have been coming back. Again, I appreciate your assistance."
travelgenio.com ia a BIG FRAUD. ban them from trade
"Hi Ludmil, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com if we can assisst you. Regards"
"Ludmil, who can ban them? I know of no global internet or consumer rights authority that can do so. Instead, protect yourself and your money by checking out who you are going to use. Look into their reputation, read their T&C's, and find out where they are based and what laws will apply if you have problems.Better still, save a bit of time and just book direct with the airlines."
"SO i called travelgenio,and i finally gave up and proceeded to cancel my booking. (actually a booking that was never made because they kept on asking for extra charges first 54euro but i got an email at 3am(japan time) before their email support closes that i have o pay 60euro more. if i won't i can cancel for free. i called and the first C.S said,""mam just follow the email thread i can't do anything"" and hang up on me. Finally i reached someone again and she processed the refund kept me on the line until i got the refund email confirmation. I was wondering i used two CC,master and amex, to verify my charges she asked for the last 4 digits of my master ($1300 charge) and i asked if she needed my amex,she said no. i asked her if both would be refunded,she said yes. but it that standard procedure? has anyone experienced the same thing?did you get a refund. btw to get a hold of a c.s i called (2-4 am japan time,i can get one altough they are not saying the same thing). i also saw a comment that says their card was initially denied by the safe something(but were charged afterwards) i kept all the screenshots and so on,incase i need to dispute. how long did it take fr other to get their refunds?overall,after i made the cancelation i had peace of mind,just hoping refunds would be ok."
"Hi Mirakfilipina, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Mira. The Travelgenio bot is still churning out the same old replies. Good luck as you are going to need it!
"i would just like to update,my amex has been debited. Somehow this bot did it's job. I'm just waiting for my other creditcard to be debited as well. so far it only took 2 days for my Amex. I'll update once my master has been credited."
"Mira. You were lucky that you found this forum, otherwise you would never have got anywhere at all! There must be so many Travelgenio customers out there who can never resolve their problems."

Thanks for your comment Mira. We try our best to give the necessary support when needed. Regards
Oh for goodness sake! The one and ONLY reason Mira got any sort of result is that she found this forum!She also mentioned how unhelpful and rude the staff manning the phones in customer services are!I give up ....I really do.
"absolutely nightmare! FLIGHTS CANCELED LAST MINUTE WITH NO NOTICE.Upon doing the check-in (48 hours before my flight) I found out that one of the flights had been canceled. Contacted Travelgenio. After listening to me for literally 5 seconds, and without even asking the ticket number the agent interrupted and to say:"" You have to contact the airline company, that's not our fault is theirs"" I had ask the agent to bare with me so that I could explain the whole situation ( A foolish attempt to be helped)After 20 long minutes on the phone with an agent who was clearly not giving a damn about my situation and who showed 0 empathy, I was left with no solution and with the following statement:""oh, it turns out that the flight Dublin- Frankfurt have been canceled, you have to sort this out with the airline, our department that handles this type of inquiry work from Monday to Friday and there's nothing we can do"" ARE YOU SERIOUS? that's beyond outrageous!!!!! NEVER AGAIN!"
"So one flight, not ""flights"" was cancelled and *not* at the ""last minute"". Not a good way to start a whinge yelling."
"Many people pluralize ""flight"" if more than one person is going. Many people do not.However, why anyone would use either of these two digital ""booking agents,"" is beyond me. Just book directly with the airline (and then rate them on their customer service if you have an issue). Rate them everywhere you can and give details."

"Travelgenio.You really need to reword the cut and pasted reply to your customers.Saying ""Of course we can help you...."" is ridiculous because if you had any intention of helping, then you would have already done so when your customers tried to get in touch on the phone or with emails. Just cut out the rhetoric!"
"I now realise that I should never have booked with Travelgenio. I paid for our flights, 4 weeks later, one of the flights were changed making us miss a connecting flight by 3 hours. I was given the option of another flight on a different day or a refund. I accepted the refund, this was December 21st 2018. Still no refund after lots of calls and emails. This us just over 1700€. They've said it could take up to 90 days. I'm really concerned about our money. Terrible customer service."
have you spoken to the airline and confirmed if they have issued a refund to Travelgenio? (Travelgenio won't refund until they receive the funds from the airline)
"Hi LaMangaJo, sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives they provide us to solve their new schedules. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards"
Travelgenio.Yet again you have NOT read the post and your bot has posted a standard useless reply.LaMangaJo was offered an alternative flight by yourselves but declined it and asked for a refund.They are still waiting for the refund.The do NOT want an alternative flight.For goodness sake! What on earth is the point of posting such utter nonsense? It never fails to amaze me just how bad your company is!Edited: 1 year ago 
"Travelgenio, don’t you realize how inept you make yourself look by posting a response like that? At least it allows for an abundance of evidence to build up for people to witness first hand how shoddy the customer service is."
"There is no point in posting these 'Get in touch, we can look into this and help you' Travelgenio replies. In my experience Travelgenio is a totally unhelpful company, if they were so willing to help why didn't they at the time when everything went wrong with their flights?This company conned us out of a lot of money (we ended up paying nearly double for the 4 flights). Every single aspect of dealing with this company was a disaster, from the booking of the tickets, the 4 flights (schedule changes but not advised, delays, cancellations, connections missed), 6 hours at International Call Rates on hold trying to use customer service (they made us wait so that they could put the price of the replacement flight up) and the luggage transfer (lost or delayed for several days twice). Their response to all this was 'did we have a screen shot of the payment page?'. When we replied we didn't, they hung up on us.If you wish for an easy travel life avoid at all costs."
"Goldacre. All I can say is you have been a member of Trip Advisor for many years, so it's such a shame you didn't find this forum and the thousands of warnings about Travelgenio before giving them your money!I'm pretty sure you will get the standard useless offer of help from the Travelgenio bot very soon!Edited: 1 year ago "
Travelgenio have again made themselves look stupid with one of their useless replies. It's a very bad joke now.
"Traveller from the UK, my last comment was not referring to a recent purchase from Travelgenio, but was prompted by an email I received from TripAdvisor yesterday regarding a post I had made here two years ago to a purchase at that time and the subsequent Travelgenio useless reply. The trouble at the time was once we had purchased the tickets, the 'cheapest' way to proceed after it all went wrong (100pct Travelgenio's doing but I did not have a screenshot to prove it) was spend more money with them buying another inflated price ticket. It was at the time a nightmare that had to be continued, or face losing 2300 Euro. But, you are right, I should have looked at TripAdvisor two years ago. ;)Edited: 1 year ago "
"Hi Alex, all info regarding the tickets, their confirmation or if they have suffered any change will be provided through customer.service@travelgenio.com. Please send us a mail and we will inform you about it. Regards"
I booked a ticket for my daughter through Travelgenio about an hour ago. I have just had a phone call from the Fraud department of my bank alerting me to two attempted credit card payments - one for R130 408.76 and the other for R125 938.03.I would avoid them like the plague!
"Just like you did then Shezzie! You may just want to take note that your post is number 1,110 on this thread alone and the majority of them are warning not to use Travelgenio!Edited: 1 year ago "

"You would have made a booking request. Hopefully, if your bank has stopped the payments that will be the end of it. Please let us know what happens."
AVOID BOOKING with travel genio as they charge you more money on their admin fee compared to the airline would have charged you if need a simple correction on your credit card payee name/ passenger. I would recommend you go ahead with some other providers. Travel Genio will just rotate your emails around their customer service team and have 0% interest on your booking or retaining any form of customer service relationship with you.Edited: 1 year ago 
"Hi Ashton, please send us all the details regarding the changes you want to make to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our agents will inform you about your rate conditions, if it is allowed. Regards"
Hi Ashton. Next time I would recommend booking directly with the airline to cut-out any middle person and extra fees all together.
"It’s both to be expected and reasonable that if you choose a middleman to buy a ticket for you, they’re going to charge you fees to do any extra work for you. Margins on sales are so small that if they were to do this for free they’d lose money on the transaction and wouldn’t stay in business,You picked a particularly poor agent to add to your woes.Slow down and pay attention to the details you’re entering, what thei terms are and above all the reputation of whom you’re buying from"
"I even called your international hotline. Guess what, your admin fee is like a stock market. One moment its 50, one moment its 30.(for change detail and this is your admin fee, not the freaking airline) I couldn't believe this is how your company operates! You should be ashamed of yourself. I hope it's not too late for anyone to see my post.Edited: 1 year ago "
"They are a dreadful company, but they don't feel shame and they don't care what people think about them. As long as hey continue to make money. That's the main thing.And they do continue to make money, because so many people don't check them out before doing business with them. The only other providers I would recommend are the airlines."
"So you typed incorrect information into their system and then they charged you a fee to fix it. They have to make money somehow. Customer service is not their forte, but I don’t see what they did wrong here. Had you typed in the correct information, there would have been no problem, right? And had you read the terms and conditions you agreed to, then the fees would not have been a surprise, right?"
"I purchased a flight in Latham through Travelgenio. Unfortunately I couldn't flight and i requested the cancellation within 24 hours ( void ticket), but travel genio answered me that the airline does not allowed the refund for cancellation. I called the airline and I was told that Travel genio was the one that does not allow the refund. What is worst is that they even asked me to fill a form to cancel the reservation May be with the intention to sell my seat again."
"Do Travelgenio offer free cancellation within 24 hours of booking? I haven't looked for myself, but I suspect they don't."
"Hi Jamt18, of course we can help you with your booking reimbursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your reimbursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards"
"I just bought a ticket on TRAVELGENIO:COM, as soon as I checked the pay by credit card option, the price jumped by more than 10%. How else could one pay when buying via the Internet. They are PRICE GOUGING. Use them to find the price of the trip and the airline and then go to the airline website directly, you can only save."

"Is there a way we can organize a major boycott of Travelgenio. They are the worst travel website in the world and they care nothing for customers. They deserve to shut down. If anyone has a suggestion on how effectively we can start a process to ensure they feel a boycott or the fact they are horrible service providers, I am happy to spend time setting that up. I thought about a facebook page, but wasnt sure if that would work?"

"Buenas tardes. El día 28 de Agosto, compre con ustedes como agencia reconocida y de confianza un pasaje solo de ida - de Paris a Sao Paulo para el 17 de septiembre. Número de reserva 7GJFCM. Compañía aérea Aigle Azur. Para mi sorpresa han cancelado mi vuelo !!!! Tengo una segunda reserva de vuelo para ese día, 17 de septiembre desde São Paulo a Buenos Aires a las 23:50 horas !!! Vuelo que me han reintegrado por la agencia que compre el pasaje. El débito de la tarjeta fue a Travelgenio por lo que necesito entrar en contacto directo con ustedes para que me re integren el dinero y poder comprar otro vuelo. Trabajo en turismo hace muchos años y entiendo como funcionan las agencias y los vuelos. Así que por favor , esto es de forma Urgente que necesito lo solucionen. Necesito urgente salir de Francia y regresar a Buenos Aires. Desde ya muchas gracias"
"Buenas tardes Natalia, Durante las próximas horas recibirá respuesta en su Email. Gracias por su colaboración."
Buenas tardes but this is supposed to be an English language forum.
Absolutely not. The airline changed their flight time which did not work for me because I was flying to a wedding. I have been trying to get the refund that has been promised to me from Travelgino for 3.5 months now. They keep repeating that I need to wait when I have been waiting for months and months. I was told the airline they sent their email to. I called the airline and they got no refund requests from Travelgino. Not the first email from 3 months ago and not the more recent one they sent September 12 2019. I am calling Travelgino every day now for half an hour (spent over 50 EU on international costs) and got nowhere. It's incredible really. Also sent them multiple emails into abyss. They actually contacted me here on tripadviso telling me they are getting me the confirmation email from the airline that refund will be issues. But I never got it. DO NOT BUY WITH THEM.
"Hi Daniel, of course we can help you with your booking reimbursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your reimbursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards"
"I called the airline company APG just like I was told by Travelgino. APG told me they have no emails and no calls or any contacts from Travelgion. I sent multiple emails to customer.service@travelgenio.com this is the response I got:Dear Mr. XXXXXX,Thank you for contacting our Advanced Support Department and sharing your comments with us. The feedback of our customers helps us to improve our products every day as well as the customer care provided.We are writing to you regarding your booking XXXXXX.In reference to your query regarding the status of your refund, we would like to inform you that the refund timing depends on the airline. At Travelgenio we proceeded to cancel the booking and manage the refund request to the airline right after we received your request. From this moment on it is the airline that must authorize the reimbursement. Therefore, the refund of the amount will be processed in your credit card once the airline authorizes the transaction. Being quite a long process, the refund can often take some time.However, we would like to inform you that we understand your situation and therefore, since Travelgenio is the intermediary travel agency, we will proceed to contact the airline directly in order to speed up this process as much as possible.As soon as we have any update we will inform you. Meanwhile, do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other reqeust or concern.Kind regards,----------------------------------------------------------------------------I sent follow up emails since to ask for the confirmation from APG that the refund is authorized and will be issued, No response. Not a single one. I called Travelgino multiple times and got no where their standard answer is ""Sir you have to wait"". Wait for what?! I have been waiting for 3.5 months now since June 9 2019. There was a rude agent Nicholas that kept repeating that and then hung up the phone on me.DO NOT BUY WITH THIS COMPANY. I will be convinced when I get my refund."
“It's incredible really.”Not really. Travelgenio has some of the most notorious customer service amongst the shonky third party middlemen. It’s extremely well-documented all over the web. What would be incredible is if they were able to help you in a timely manner.
"You will get a refund at some point, though Travelgenio may take extra fees from it before they finally pass it on. I don't think anyone can know at what point Travelgenio will have asked the airline for the refund. Maybe they still haven't bothered. All we know is that they will continue spouting the same lines, just as their bot does here, until they get fed up and hang up.There's no point in contacting them now. Either wait it out, or see f your card provider can do anything."
"So it has been 109 days since I received the email from Travelgino saying I will get a refund for the cancelled flight.It has also been 10 days since I called Travelgino every day for 2 weeks to ask for my refund because about 4 weeks ago I was suppose to get the refund at the latest.I have literally begged Travelgino to send me the confirmation email from APG airlines stating their intention to refund the flight. APG themselves told me that if that email does not exist I will not get a refund. Travelgino refuses to present me with such email. AGP also said that the email is to be shared with the customer (me), they said that the email is not confidential.The way Travelgino handled themselves is outrageous I am given no explanation what so ever beyond the general message all their customer support people repeat saying I must wait. I have been waiting for almost 4 months now.Honestly I don't know if I will ever get the money back. But it is important to expose these scammers who are holding on to my money paid in good faith for a product I have never obtained received or used because it was cancelled by them.If you read this message because you are considering purchasing flights with this company. Do yourself and your family a favor go with the big companies or directly from the Airlines. Even if it means you will pay an extra 20$ at least at least in the case of flight cancellation you will get your refund in a timely manner."
"Daniel, was the flight ever booked? Did you check at the airline website to see if horrible Travelgenio had actually purchased the ticket you had asked for? Was your credit card charged after you made a booking request with Travelgenio?It's your decision, but I'd have stopped calling Travelgenio weeks ago. If your card had been charged but no booking appeared at the airline's website then I'd contact my credit card provider and ask that the charge be disputed as no product was provided after payment made.Let the bank sort it out. You likely have better things to do with your time than try to get any response from Travelgenio, who are a miserable excuse of an operation."
"Hi Daniel, we will be more than pleased to inform you about the refund process and status in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"NEVER EVER BOOK WITH TRAVELGENIOThey scammed me for 670 eur, they showed me in thier website that there's a connected flights , no selftransfer. Once I'm in the airport they didn't let me fly because i haf to make self transfer. This is crazy.I tried to call them they keep me.waiting unti the call ends.I sent them an email ,i receive an automatic reply, no human contact and my money are gone.I was traveling to china from Morocco , stop over in Portugal.#Travelgenio Scammers"
"Hi Zakaria, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
"AVOID ABSOLUTELY TRAVELGENIOI write this message for all those who are preparing to book via travelgenio, STOP ALL, their practices are really dishonest. I booked a flight of 4 hours through them, then later I received an email to say that the flight was canceled (while the flight still existed) but they offered to relocate me on another flight with stopover of 12 hours in total. I replied that I did not want this alternative and they told me that they would send me an email with a new alternative. More than a month later and after more than 10 calls they offered me a new flight alternative that I accepted directly by mail and phone. And since I did not receive any news during 3 weeks and that the date of my flight was getting closer, I called them to ask them the flight tickets (of the second alternative that I have accepted) and they told me that this flight did not exist and that I should be satisfied with the first alternative so the flight of about 12 hours and that without any compensation. To summary they propose alternatives, then say that they do not exist. It’s really shameful. Not to mention the fact that you have to wait a long time (on charged call) for someone to answer the phone every time and that nobody was really able to help me anyway (and sometimes they will cut off on your nose), if you have that kind of problem you are screwed and that's all. Many people complain about travelgenio because they are catastrophic, unfortunately personally I only saw this after booking.This company is just to AVOID and then it's always the same thing, they will comment this publication with this kind of message ""Hi, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the procedure.” Do not tire yourself, I will tell my experience with you on all forums and pages of flight comparators. RegardsI have the proof mails of all that I advance"
"Hi MMM, when flights got cancelled we can only offer the airlines' alternatives. If you need us to check the current details, do not hesitate in contacting us through customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"That's not the problem, my problem is that you have proposed an alternative to me that I have accepted and when I called you to receive my tickets you respond that this alternative doesn't exist. Why do you have proposed an inexistant alternative ??????? It's really SHAMEFUL !!!!!!!!But I will share what you have done to me with everybody in order that they avoid to pass by your agency in the futur."
Could you tell us your booking code to find out all the procedure and airline confirmation for all the alternatives providen? Thanks in advance
">>>I will share what you have done to me with everybody in order that they avoid to pass by your agency in the futur.<<<If only that was indeed the case the shonky booking sites would struggle to survive. Sadly, all the evidence is that insufficient people look for warnings and complaints beforehand. I mean, I don't suppose you did, otherwise you would surely have avoided them."
It has been 21 days since my last update here about me not getting the refund Travelgenio stated they will provide.In total it has been 120 days since I got the email from Travelgenio saying they will refund the flight.For a period I had called them every single day for almost three weeks. Emailed back and sometimes forth (because for some emails I never got a response)At the moment I am in the midst of a an official claim process with VISA's dispute and fraud department against Travelgenio.WARNING: To anyone who reads here aviod Travelgenio like a plague. Go with other bigger and more established options or better yet directly with the Airlines. They provide no service and care not about customer support.
">>>They provide no service and care not about customer support.<<<That's pretty evident by their own postings in threads - or their bot's postings to be absolutely accurate.Edited: 11:51 am, October 17, 2019 "
"Hi Daniel, refunds depend on airlines approval and process. Please send us a mail with all the booking details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will be able to inform you about the current status and info provided by them for your case. Regards"
And there's the evidence to support what I said in post 1150!!
"Do not believe a single word the Travelgenio ""representative"" here says I had sent countless emails literally dozens - only got replied on half of them, I called dozens of times. I was told over and over again that I need to wait. Nothing else. I got even hung up on twice!Warning: This is the type of customer service you will get from Travelgenio. Emails into a black hole. Repeated messages on the phone and hang ups.Day 120 since promised a refund and counting. DO NOT BUY WITH Travelgenio."
"Don't worry Daniel, I won't!!!!Travelgenio use a bot to reply on here. They don't read any of the posts."
Hello Daniel.As we are in the exact same situation I would like to know if you managed to get your refund from Travelgenio?Regards.
"Hi Syrine 30, of course we can help you with your booking reimbursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your reimbursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards"
"Hi Travelgenio,I have already contacted your customer service many times and they keep repeating that the airline did not authorize the reimbursement yet and I have to wait. I have been waiting for 4 months!!! My booking reference is O7XCQO. I would like to know if somebody managed to get his refund from Travelgenio.Regards"
"Hi Syrine, you will receive a reply by mail during next few hours. Regards"
"Hi Syrine, I called Travelgino for literally 14 days every day and got nowhere. This was a flight from London to Greece through Hungary. Right now I am in an official fraud/dispute process with VISA to try and have VISA to pressure them to refund the money. Have a go at your Credit Card company, find their SCAM/FRAUD department and submit an official complaint to start the process.It has been 18 days since my last update here about me not getting the refund Travelgenio stated they will provide.In total it has been 138 days since I got the email from Travelgenio saying they will refund the flight."
"Hi Daniel Vas, refunds depend on airline authorisation and process. Once they manage it, we are able to make it effective. If you need us to check the current status of yours, please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
I am done talking to you Travelgino. You will be talking with VISA FRAUD DISPUTE and SCAM departments from now on.
"I doubt the bot will care, but you're doing the right thing. In fact, I wouldn't have waited this long."
We wanted to let it play out. Almost paid for it because there are time limits to submit FRAUD SCAM DISPUTE requests.This company is dishonest and I will also look into filing small court suit. Unfortunately I live in Canada and the amount is not sufficient to retain a local lawyer.
"All you need to do to dispute the charge is to explain what happened and submit any supporting evidence you have. There is no need to say it's fraud or a scam.But yes, there will be a time limit."
"I don't know why anyone would try to contact this wretched excuse of a website more than two or three times with the same response each time. The better action seems to contact one's credit card supplier and let them deal with this rotten operation.Having said that, the carrier's fare rules and the terms of the agent - Travelgenio - will apply to any refunds that are available. Daniel, you said 'The airline changed their flight time which did not work for me because I was flying to a wedding.' If you asked Travelgenio to cancel the flight then if they had bought a discounted ticket there may not be much in terms of a refund for you, especially as Travelgenio will charge a fee for processing the refund.Stop contacting Travelgenio and let your bank deal with them. If you've spent as much time as you say on this then what you might receive may not be worth the time you've spent trying to claw back a very small amount of money."
"When I told them that other dates won't work for me Travelgenio stated they will fully refund the tickets. That same day I had received an email from Travelgenio stating that the refund is going to be handled by Travelgenio. Which they did not. That was Sunday, June 9, 2019 exactly 148 days ago. Right now all hope is that VISA will pressure them to refund me."
"'When I told them that other dates won't work for me Travelgenio stated they will fully refund the tickets. That same day I had received an email from Travelgenio stating that the refund is going to be handled by Travelgenio.'Travelgenio could have said all sorts of things but it doesn't matter at all as the carrier's rules will indicate what if any refund is available. Unless you asked Travelgenio to buy a flexible ticket they'd have purchased the most restricted and discounted fare available, with the only refund some of the taxes and fees.There is one way you might be able to negotiate a refund from the carrier. Depending on how far in advance of departure you learned of the schedule change then there could be the option of a refund of the fare in full, but since you asked useless Travelgenio to buy the ticket they'd have to process that and they will charge a fee to do it.It's not worth your time trying to contact Travelgenio, let Visa sort it out."
"I had booked several times with a third party like ""CheapTickets"" through Skyscanner.The first time was perfect. (given you dont need to do ANY/cancellation change on your ticket)The second and third time was AWEFUL. - on my second travel they ""forgot"" to book my return ticket. The Airline didnt want to allow me on the place, although my friend was booked correctly with the same reservation. They told me they didnt receive a reservation under my name for the return. It was such a mess and I had to call them for 1hour (super expensive call fare) so they fix THEIR OWN mistake.- on my third booking with them, I needed to make a change and ended paying the same price as a super expensive ticket.and they're not helpful. if you want to make a change the same day of your flight, forget it and consider your ticket lost (that s what happened to me).I prefer now to pay 50 $ more and make the reservation through the airline directly."
">> if you want to make a change the same day of your flight, forget it and consider your ticket lost (that s what happened to me). <<Same day changes can indeed be very expensive as airline fare rules are often change fee + fare difference. The cost of the flights on the day of travel are likely to be considerably more than you originally paid when adding that to the change fee and the third party fee it can sometimes be cheaper to buy a new ticketnote - this would be the exact same position if you book direct with the airline apart from they would be easier to deal with and you would not have a third party fee on top of the change fee and fare difference. (but it may still be the case where a new ticket would be cheaper)"
"Hi Daniel Vas if you need us to check the current refund status, do not hesitate in contacting us with all the booking details in customer.service@travelgenio.com. RegardsEdited: 6:34 am, November 14, 2019 "
Travelgenio will need a new bot soon. The present one must be worn out!
"It doesn't seem to be showing nay signs of fatigue, though. It's continuing to tort out the same meaningless drivel that it's always trotted out. That's probably just as well as Travelgenio may not be able to afford a replacement, or justify spending the money even if they can. I'd be sad to see it go. I'd kind of miss it, like having a bad tooth taken out it will leave a gap, despite it being ultimately better for it to disappear. Maybe I'd feel differently if I'd ever been foolish enough to use this mob, and had issues with them along the way."
"We would never use Travelgenio again. They are rude and shonky, save yourself a lot of trouble and go straight to the airline."
"Hello Karen. We would like to help you with your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com so that one of our agents can contact you. Thank you, regards."
UPDATE: RESOLVED.So after 192 days that Travelgenio (the fraudsters) withheld my money VISA stepped in and adjusted the whole amount back to us.Travelgenio never paid a dime back. I had to call VISA multiple times and fight them to look into this issue. If you are having issues getting the money from Travelgenio call your credit card and fight them until the open the case. Don't take no for an answer as they also tried to get rid of me. Call back your credit card every two weeks and follow up on the status. In one of the calls I found out that the case was closed. Then had to fight them to re-open it.After two months of fighting VISA to investigate the issue they refunded me the full amount.
Glad you finally got your money back Daniel.Cant wait to see the bot’s response!
It's easier to go via your card provider. Even if you have to fight them for 2 months that's nothing compared to dealing with Travelgenio!I have a feeling that the bot is going to remain silent on this one!
"I booked with Travelgenio last August for flights to the US in September. Closer to the travel date I wished to change one leg of the journey so I contacted them. I was informed that my booking had been cancelled as one of the airlines involved had changed their schedule so the cancellation was automatic, which they had neglected to inform me, so I could easily have only discovered this at the airport . ( I subsequently checked and the airline had moved the time of a connecting flight by 5 minutes, which made no difference at all to the booking.) Anyway I rebooked my flights direct with the airlines once I knew Travelgenio had cancelled the original booking and all was fine. Only Travelgenio have still not refunded me for the cancelled ticket- four months after the date, and this was for four business class flights and not cheap! Repeated emails have been ignored and calls to their switch have achieved nothing- apparently they have to wait for the airline to refund them. Four months??Or they're just holding on to the money in the hope that I'll forget about it. Not gonna happen. Avoid this company at all costs. I appreciate I'm not the first to flag this company and certainly won't be the last, but the more genuine warnings to customers out there, the better. I've posted this on several other sites and received the standard bot reply from Travelgenio- which results in ....nothing.Edited: 11:12 am, January 16, 2020 "
"Hi Ted, To review your case in detail, please could you write to us at customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the details, so we can check what happened?. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards."
has the airline confirmed that they have issued the refund to Travelgenio? third parties don't refund until they have the funds back from the airline (although I would have hoped the airline would have dealt with the refund by now)
">>>I've posted this on several other sites and received the standard bot reply from Travelgenio- which results in ....nothing.<<<And now you have another one to add to your collection. Luck you!Seriously, I reckon you'll get your money at some point. When that is, I wouldn't like to hazard a guess. You could try and contact your card provider. That might hurry things along a bit."
Forget Travelgenio. Call your Credit Card provider dispute department and demand an investigation and a refund. Within a month or two you will get your money back.
I wouldn't demand anything. I'd just tell them what has happened and ask if they can help.
January 2020. USed travelgenio & they charge me twice the amount. Credit cardf said it was authorize as there is 2 transaction numbers. But only one ticket was ever issued.Tried to getv in touch wityh them but the message you try to send after doing all the mumbo jumbo is not sending the message.They are thieft and no ones does anything about it.
"Their bot will be along soon to spout it’s usual platitudes.Not sure who you expect to do something about it?i do my bit by choosing not to use them or any other shonky ticket flogger. Instead of expecting some organisation to,protect you, protect yourself by researching before buying."
"+1 to learning how to protect yourself and your money. In the meantime, try again with your card provider. Explain that even if there are two transaction numbers, you have only got one ticket, so you have paid for something you haven't received.Of course, there is always the possibility that you will end up with two tickets, one of which you don't want. If that happens, I don't know what to suggest, sorry."
"Hi Eric, Thank you for contacting us. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com stating your reference and explaining what doubts you have so we can study your case and give you an answer. Thank you."
"Worst customer service I have ever seen.My situation is that I have been trying to contact through email and phone number, however, during two weeks later continuously calling, none of my call has been answered. If I could rate with negative number, Travelgenio's service should be (-5). I hope that my post helps to the one who is booking with this agent."
Hello Bilguun. Of course we can help you in relation to your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com indicating what doubts you have and we will reply as soon as possible. Regards.
"I have been buying my tickets with these kind of websites and there were no problem until now, but this time I had booked Hong Kong flights with travelgenio - DO NOT EVER BUY SERVICES OF THIS COMPANY!Due to coronavirus epidemic, I had to cancel my trip. AirChina is issuing a full refund without any questions, so it shall be easy for travelgenio to get the money back and give me full refund. However, I have been sending messages to their French, UK, US and many other branches since weeks now, and I haven't heard any word from them! My travel is due in 5 days! Honestly, I have never seen such a bad travel company in my life (and I travel very often). Another point is that, the return flight is rescheduled and travelgenio still shows my itinerary as the previous flight status. It feels like they are ghosting all the news updates as a company. As the icing on the cake, they do not provide any phone number in 'contact us' section, you can only fill in a contact form - which they never reply.Bearing in mind that there can be an epidemic, or a life and death situation at any given time, I would not suggest using travelgenio services, if you don't want to die or being literally forced to take the flights (even though all air companies have stopped flights to the regions where epidemic is taking thousands of lives and even the airline company is making no problem issuing a refund) or take this easily resolvable issue to the court and lose extra time and energy."

Can anyone tell me who regulates this company? Basically need to place a complaint against them for failure of refunds which airlines HAVE refunded to them but they have not passed on to me. I am only looking for replies on who the regulatory body is for travel2be or travelgenio. I've found out who the CEO is and emailed him already but I need a legal body to complain too.TIA.
"They are based in Spain, which is on lockdown. And they have been using these tactics for many, many years, so you can be sure that the money they don’t spend on customer service has been spent on lawyers to ensure that they operate within the letter of the law."
"As I requested. I am only looking for replies on who the regulatory body is. Nothing else. However, I do appreciate your replies."
"Right now, there really is nobody you can complain to. Spain is in total lockdown, so there will be nobody in the offices of Travelgenio or of any regulatory body.In the circumstances, I do not think you can have any reasonable expectation of a refund until Spain comes out of lockdown.Edited: 12:59 am, April 11, 2020 "
"Kevin, why bother it’s not going to get you anywhere. The world travel industry is in total disarray, sometimes it’s time to move on. Do you really think a CEO will ever look at your complaint? It will be passed straight to an admin person who will file it at the bottom of a very large pile.If you are looking for a refund and If you are certain the airline has refunded then if you paid by CC/DC you can dispute it with the provider. Fees are likely to be deducted from any refund. It won’t be a quick process and not every dispute is a guaranteed payout.Refunds are taking a long time these days."

"AirItaly went to bankruptcy in February 5, and I spent $3,000 and I cannot get them back. AirItaly tells me over the phone that they do reimburse their customers through the month of April, but because I bought my airfare not direct, but with such a scammers as Travel2be and Travelgenio (both are the same company - they even go by different names to create more scam!) - I cannot claim my airfare expense back because of these morons - Travel2be and Travelgenio ignore the fact that AIrItaly had been liquidated and the passenger must get reimbursed in accordance with AirItaly policies. AirItaly had already reimbursed their customers! And I cannot receive my money back because this 3d party try to steal my money! These TRavel2be and Travelgenio are real European scam created Online! They DO NOT reply on my emails and they switched of their telephone lines! What the shameful scam you created Online - go to hell with the coronavirus thing - both, Travel2be and Travelgenio - please go to HELL! Stealers!

"Thank you for contacting us Ina. As you know, refund times in case of bankruptcy depend on various legal processes within the airlines, and travel agencies are subject to these. In any case, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your reference so that we can check the status of processing with the airline. Thank you. "

perchè Travelgenio rifiuta qualsiasi tipo di rimborso su voli cancellati per covid quando la compagnia rimborsa tali biglietti??? Che fine fanno i soldi pagati a travelgenio se la compagnia aerea rimborsa travelgenio ma travelgenio non rimborsa i passeggeri??? Questa è appropriaszione indebita!!!!
"Palcivas, you've posted in the English language version of the forums. Have you tried contacting Travelgenio about your refund?"
"Palcivas, Si prega di inviare all'indirizzo customer.service@travelgenio.com, dall'indirizzo e-mail con cui è stata effettuata la prenotazione, indicando il codice di prenotazione nell'oggetto (codice di 8 cifre che appare nell'e-mail di conferma) e riceverai le istruzioni per contattare."
"Used them and never will ever again. Where you can, book through the airline directly. Travelgenio still owe me a full refund for flights that were cancelled four months ago. Thai cancelled two weeks ago and are in the process of refunding me the full amount already."
"You didn't seem to want our advice last time, Kevin, so I will withhold advice on your request"
"Kevin J, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
I have not gotten a refund yet either! It’s been months!
"Hi Lauren, as a third party, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
Lauren:You can wait forever for this bad company or you can dispute with your credit card company. Not sure why you picked them. Red Flags all over the internet about them
They already have refunded you!!!! I was just in contact with the airline. This is embarrassing!
Then there's no need to delay further. Go to your card provider and get them to help you.
"This is so hilarious...Nobody answer when I try to contact travelgenio or tripmonster. Sure, it takes long time to refund our flights witch was cancelled 4 months ago, and they promise to pay money back to credit card which was used when we payed those flights. But now that card is expired so where they will pay those refunds..."
But now that card is expired so where they will pay those refunds...Doubt it's a problem you'll have to worry about.
Travel genio is a complete nightmare. My uncles flight was cancelled due to Covid and I have tried to contact travelgenio a number of times for a refund and have not had a response. Why are companies like this allowed to operate?!
"Never ever book with these cowboys. They owe me money from an airline cancellation and are withholding funds illegally. If anyone is thinking of booking a flight, go direct. Do not use these people. They should lose their right to operate."
"Sdevi and Kevin: This thread is over 6 years old. We have dozens/hundreds of other threads with thousands of complaints about TG all over these boards.You cannot trust that every company on the Internet has good customer service and quality ownership. You MUST DO RESEARCH before you give your money away. You've been a member here for many years, Kevin, and you know these boards. You are repeating advice given thousands of times . . . that you yourself ignored.File disputes with your credit cardTELL YOUR FRIENDS not to use these companies. People like you who don't do any research. THOSE are the folks you need to reach.Book direct in the future."
"“Why are companies like this allowed to operate?!”They are allowed to operate because they are not doing anything illegal. Incompetence is not illegal. Shoddy customer service is not illegal. How can the keep operating with such bad customer service? Because people continue to give them money and business, even with hundreds of thousands of complaints and warnings all over the internet. We have threads here going back years. And yet you still gave them money. The more interesting question is why, despite all the warnings did you give them your business? What stopped you from booking direct?"
"Marko, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Kevin J, Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"It was my first time using Travelgenio, but will NEVER again. I would recommend you to book through the airline directly. The flight was cancelled 4 months ago and Travelgenio still owe me a full refund. It's been 4 months! I've literally emailed multiple times regarding this request and they keep ghosting my emails."
"Dispute with your credit card if you can, JunYeal"
"JunYeal, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
"II have the same problem. Travelgenio keep saying that my refund will be processed ""pending authorization from the airline"", however I called Qantas directly to clarify this and they said ""that is completely incorrect"" and it has nothing to do with them, Travelgenio have to refund the money regardless of the airline.II would never recommend Travelgenio to anyone."
"Marco, you either misunderstood or Qantas lied to you. TG will not refund anything to you until they have received the refund from the airline. You are not the customer of the airline. TG is. The refund first goes back to them and then it will be passed along to you, minus TG’s fees. TG needs to request the refund from the airline. Call back and clarify that this has been done."
"Marco V, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
"For months I have been trying to contact Travelgenio and the phone line hangs up after a few minutes and the email address contact comes back saying that they do not recognise the booking number - even though they won’t accept an email unless you put the booking number in the subject so it has priced impossible to co tact them. They ask you to put in your email address that you used to make the booking on their contact form and they send a link to your email address and you click on the link and you go to my trips and your booking comes up. For weeks when I checked it said that they were waiting for airline approval for the refund but now when I put in my email address when I used to make the booking when contacting them it doesn’t recognise the email address and not only that but when I go to check the original booking that I made last July it says that the information doesn’t exist on their server. So basically it seems that Travelgenio keep all of your information on a server when they contact you and then they just wipe the server whenever they want, leaving no proof of any emails they sent to you. My booking has basically vanished off their system. Booking id 14968687. I’m due a refund if 2800 for flights from Dublin to Vancouver that were cancelled in April. Very distressing. The email address for their customer service also doesn’t work and this is the email address that they keep telling everyone in the reviews (ie Trustpilot) to contact but you can’t send an email to that address because as stated above, they ask you to put in the email address you used to make the booking when contacting them but then you get a reply to say that the email address doesn’t exist. And from today, funnily enough, an error message comes up when you try to send an email to their customer service email address saying “this email cannot be sent”. Have they gone bust? Seems like it to me. All I want is a booking invoice to give to my travel insurance company and I can’t even get that. So distressed. The worst company I’ve ever dealt with in my life. Will be filing a complaint to the aviation authority."
"Unfortunately i am one of the unlucky ones that got scammed of USD $595 for a plane ticket,got confirmation email, looked so legit, but the next day i went on the airline to check and they have NO RECORDS, booking number does not exist, and by the next day flight was cancelled, needless to say I will not get a refund.there is ZERO way to get in contact with these people and their so called customer service, I learned the hard way, I declare a blatant curse through the powers of the universe to this so called Travelgenio that is stealing our HARD EARNED money. DO NOT USE THEIR SITE TO BOOK ANYTHING!!!!!"
"same thing happened to me, my money disappeared, and these people are basically un-contactable. If you know a way to warn the general public, please let me know, I definitely will post it in my travel groups about them."
"Have you contacted your credit card company about a refund, Lonia?And this IS the warning to the general public. Somehow you missed over a thousand posts going back for quite some time.You can reach out directly to your friends and Facebook friends and warn them because so many people don't read warning threads like this that you will likely save someone else the anxiety you are going through. Posting here won't really make a differenceEdited: 10:56 am, August 04, 2020 "
"Lonia M, Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"Lania, all you can really do is to tell people you know how awful this lot are and implore them to book directly with the airlines, or at least use a proper, reputable travel agency,Even then, I suspect that at least some of them will still just go with whichever company they see that advertises a cheap price. But at least you will have tried.As N_T says, your money is probably not lost at all. TG are useless, but they are not criminals. Your card provider might be able to speed things up."
u r scammes dont pretend to be somone else ok ??? u took the money and then u cancel the trips
"I didn't, and I am sure Roj would not do that either."
"Oh Mos, that's really funny. Having said how useless TG and others are, possibly 10000 times now down the years, do you really think I am them but pretending not to be? Hilarious!"
“u r scammes dont pretend to be somone else ok ??? u took the money and then u cancel the trips”I don’t know who “u r” are supposed to be but if you haven’t yet realised this is a public travel forum where people offer advice to their fellow travellers and not the website of travelgenio then it’s time for you to give yourself a good talking to about the foolishness of handing over money before doing any research.
"I'm pretty confident that the message from Mos is directed at TG, but I don't quite get the 'pretend' bit. Unless it just refers to the lies that the bot is programmed to post here."
