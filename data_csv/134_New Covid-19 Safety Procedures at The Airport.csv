"Thank you for posting this information, however, Bermuda needs to come out with their protocols AFTER you leave the airport. What happens after a passenger gets the COVID-19 test, and no mention of what type of test is being administered. From what I understand, the opening of the airport is really only for returning Bermudians, in no way is the island ready to welcome tourists. Most of the larger hotels will remain closed to well after the tourist season is over.Edited: 3:31 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"To the best of my knowledge (???)....after you have been tested at the airport and depart for your guest accommodations, you are '..quarantined..' at your place of accomodation until your airport arrival Covid-19 test has been processes and returned negative. They are saying that most tests are now being processed within 8 hours/no longer than 24. Once your test comes back negative, you're free to leave your guest accommodations and be out 'n about Bermuda...within the limits of local social distancing, masks, etc. that all Bermudians are subject to on an everyday basis.But, at least initially, there won't be all that many tourists arriving in Bermuda. So far only Delta, one-flight-per-day daily from Atlanta(ATL) ONLY...Ait Canada one flight per week, from Toronto(YYZ) and British Air with 2 flights per week from London-Gatwick(LGW). Add to this, that airlines are limiting flight capacity to significantly lower (35%-40%) '..social-distancing..' seating capacity. As an example, a Boeing 737 of Airbus 319/320 aircraft with a normal passenger capacity of up-to 140 passengers will only accommodate 45-to-55 passengers.No doubt in time, American, Jet Blue and Delta will also be renewing Bermuda air service from Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Miami....but when exactly remains to be seen...and social-distancing capacities will also be reduced.Preliminary Re-Opening L.F.

"I have a feeling that health insurance is going to be a major problem. My OHIP no longer covers any out of country medical costs. It's possible to buy medical insurance for traveling but at what cost I hate to think. Age is already an issue for me as far as cost is concerned and I doubt whether any company is going to cover Covid.I could of course take my chances and travel without insurance and be prepared to pay the cost if I am ill for any reason. But it seems that Bermuda may not allow me in without insurance.It may be that I and many others like me will never travel again outside our own country. The Atlantic provinces, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, PEI and NFL have already banded together to restrict travel from Ontario and Quebec."
"I just checked out some cabins in far northeastern Maine (the next turn off has a '..Welcome To Canada..' sign at the end of the exit ramp) that my family used to spend summers at when I was a kid (back when Maine was still first-growth, old forest and the Passamaquoddy tribe were still doin' test trials on their first canoe designs and hand carving dice for their tribal casino craps tables...this place is so far into the '..back-of-beyond that even the local moose carry maps and a compass or have GPS mounted on their antlers)...as a possible alternative vacation destination for this cominmg summer. It appears that the State of Maine has Covid-19 travel restrictions (proof of negative Covid-19 testing performed no less that 72 hours prior to entry or commit to a 14 day quarantine, etc.) for just about everyone except for residents of Vermont and New Hampshire. So, there's nuthin' especially special about Bermuda's Covid-19 restrictions. They're just tryin' to protect the health and general welfare of their own residents....as well as that of their valued '..guests..'."
"Under the conditions imposed by Bermuda, there will be NO tourists for the rest of the year."
"There will be some but probably not enough to even come close as to helping the hotel industry along with anything to do with hospitality, which has a trickIe down effect on quite a few other businesses.I am guessing that some or most of the hotels have a very big decision to make in the next couple weeks as to remain closed for the remainder of the year or try to reopen with limited staff and just hope to survive. I would think that some of them are trying to think out side the box and offer locals some great deals and maybe even day pass promotions like a couple have done in the past. Sounds like it is a no win either way, to open you lose money to remained closed you lose money, not a nice position to be in. Good luck everyone."
"I'm not really complaining about Bermuda, Just stating with some sadness that if medical insurance becomes an issue then it could be difficult to go anywhere.At the moment I would be happy to be able to just get my hair cut !!Re comments about Maine, my daughter who lives in Muskoka, cottage country a couple of hours north of Toronto, had a young bear on her property yesterday. They haven't seen the mother bear for a while so are keeping a lookout !!"
"Our Delta flights in October from Boston to Bermuda have not been cancelled -- I guess I need to append the word ""yet"" to all such statements. Nor has our Hamilton Princess reservation been cancelled -- yet. It was a Pink Sale reservation, fully payable in advance and non-refundable, that we made back in January. Their website says closed until at least August 1. I would truly love to go, and have no problem with hanging out at the hotel the first day while waiting for our test results to come back.Edited: 11:28 am, June 25, 2020 "
">>>...Under the conditions imposed by Bermuda, there will be NO tourists for the rest of the year...<<<Under the conditions....tourist are gonna' be thin-on-the-ground EVERYWHERE for a while (though Virgin Galactic may pick up a few more reservations for their Moon excursions) . Even local parks and playgrounds within easy strolling/walking distances of home are gonna' be a whole helluva' lot less frequented."

"I just listened to the live government briefing. So 72 hours prior to departure or 10 days before you need a Negative Covid PCR test. Then once you arrive you will have to take another PCR test . While waiting for results, you have to stay at your accommodation until you receive results (8-24 hrs). Once negative result, you are free to roam about. Daily you have to take your temperature and log it on a website log? Then Day 3 you have to test again, as well day 7. So my question is, who is paying for the two Covid tests? And do the health officers come to your accommodation to perform the test? Or do you have to go to a testing site. Is health insurance not required? I feel a lot of information was left out from this briefing."
"These ridiculous protocols will certainly ensure that Bermuda will NOT be welcoming any tourists for the forseeable future. What tourist would want to undergo testing 3 times, daily temperature checks?I realize and understand that Bermuda needs to keep it's citizens safe, however, 1 PCR test done upon arrival should be sufficient."
"In any case, Canadians need to understand that while there is an international travel warning in Canada, ANY type of insurance purchased will be null and void.Canadians travelling abroad do so at their own risk and expense if they get sick. They also have to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return to Canada.Trudeau made it very clear that he is in no hurry to remove the travel restriction, and I suspect they will remain in place until end of year."
As non resident of Bermuda I have to applaud their measures put in place to protect their citizens. If only more governments did the same the world would be further ahead. Only a fool would subscribe to the idea that fewer tests will result in less positives thus its going away. The way things are going I foresee the possibility that not only the EU will impose restrictions on US travellers but also a lot of other nations to better protect their people.Bermuda must do what they think is right for their citizens.
"As per previous announcement ....at least for the testing in Bermuda, YOU, the tourist, will be responsible for the cost ***IF*** you still intend to visit Bermuda in August--""...Visitors to pay fee for tests in Bermuda...""--(Royal Gazette--June 19, 2020)royalgazette.com/tourism/article/20200619/vi…As for "".. these ridiculous protocols.."", Bermuda's requirements are no more '..ridiculous..' or onerous than a great many other destinations 'round the world. Get used to it...OR...consider a '..stay-cation..' at home as an alternative. Things just just ain't gonna' return to '..normal..' to serve your convenience any time soon.."
