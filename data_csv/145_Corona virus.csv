We planed our flight with FlyDubai on 3rd of July to Zanzibar for the first time.Please give us info about the situation of Corona virus in Zanzibar. We should travel with our child and we are very worried.
Tanzania is no longer reporting Coronavirus statistics to the WHO.Do you have medical coverage in case you need to be hospitalized with Covid 19?
"Maryann,Is anyone really reporting to who anymore ?It looks mostly everyone is behind or lost confidence in it, And the future and control of who is also questionable, it only gets...you know what i mean,If you need realistic figures for any location just multiply by 2 or even 3,It looks like these days you only die of corona, otherwise you are not considered a human."
"@Dragana!I am from Zanzibar, and Zanzibar is under the United Republic of Tanzania. When the President of the United Republic of Tanzania re-opened Tourism on 17th May 2020 this included Zanzibar. Even if you google the Corona situation in Zanzibar, the data will show Tanzania. The President of the United Republic allowed Tourists to come to Tanzania including Zanzibar with open arms. Just check your temperature before coming to Tanzania, at the airport if your temperature is Ok, you will be welcomed and continue with your tour. No 14 days quarantine any more! The first Tourists to arrive in Tanzania during this Covid-19 operation were from Greece. Arrived on 22nd May 2020 their temperature was OK, they proceeded with their tour completed on 28th May 2020 and flew back home. They flew in without Corona and flew out without Corona. So don't allow people to make you panic any more regarding coming to Zanzibar. Just give your Zanzibar organizer your flight details so that that you will be picked up from Kisauni Zanzibar airport and proceed to your destination. In Zanzibar, we are starting to receive tourists coming with FLY DUBAI(DUBAI-ZANZIBAR-DAR ES SALAAM-DUBAI) with effect from 19th June,2020, 3 times a week."
Good to know that FlyDubai will resume flights in June. Hope to be true. We had the same concerns as we had tickets on June but decided to postpone for July. We are travelling with a kid also and are a bit worry about the lack of information on covid evolution there but really do not want to miss this trip. Hope this island is still safe enough and terms of delinquency also...
"#3, do you have info regarding Turkish Airlines flights ?They are bookable from the 10th, but not sure if they will start for real"
"@Nicolas!Of course, it will start on 10th June 2020 because are not only bookable but they also issue flight tickets. If you book before 10th June 2020 they can never issue you flight tickets."
"Hopefully Travel can resume soon. Countries and airports have to do quite some work in putting measures to adhere to the guidelines against crowding etc. The airport at Zanzibar needs quite some restructuring. While there in February, the holding lounge needs quite some work. Hopefully that has been looked into.Can't wait to get back to normalization.Edited: 12:49 pm, May 31, 2020 "
"Please read the official Travel Advisory published by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania on 18 May 2020 on my Facebook page ""Zanzibar Insider Buzz"" (unfortunately I cannot attach here), as well as info on the hotels I know of that open in July on the island incl specials. I keep that fb page updated.www.zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.com"
"Hi every one, In fact Zanzibar is officially opened for Holiday, all schedule and charter flight are now allowed to landing in Zanzibar as the Ministry of Tourism announced to the general public, health system have well arranged to the airport and ferry , ready to welcome tourist.The same situation in Tanzania mainlan where wildlife parks are ready to welcome all tourist with health preventive system have putting in places all areas, if you are looking to travel to Tanzania, Qatar airways, Turkish, Fly Dubai, Emirate and Ethiopian airline resumed their plan to Tanzania. domestic flight are operating daily.Tanzania is safe and ready for welcoming Tourist for Beach holiday and Wild life Safari."
"""Qatar airways, Turkish, Fly Dubai, Emirate and Ethiopian airline resumed their plan to Tanzania.""In theory perhaps, but flightradar24.com shows only Ethiopian planes confirmed landing at Dar, plus one KLM passenger 777 yesterday (but a scheduled tourist flight or an evacuation?)No confirmed landings of scheduled passenger jets on Zanzibar today or yesterday. If I'm wrong please correct me."
"I'm watching the same things as you KronickR and as far as I can see (flights not bookable through the airlines websites) those companies haven't resumed their service yet, unfortunately"
"I permanently live on Zanzibar and just postponed my annual visit of my mom in Germany since I feel much safer here. Adhere to social distancing (which is easy on our endless beaches), wear a face mask or shield and wash your hands plenty of times, there are many hand wash stations all over the place. Additionally I use my own hand sanitizer when I am out and about. Even on the daladalas (public transport) wearing a mask is obligatory. Having said that, rather rent a car and explore the island which works out cheaper than using taxis. The hotels received strict guidelines as to how to insure your safety and the safety of their staff.Make sure you have a medical insurance cover (usually included in a travel insurance), you will be asked for it on arrival, and it gives you peace of mind. www.zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.com"
KronickR: Zanzibar only opened her borders on 6 June for passenger flights/ferries. I heard of an Ethiopian Airlines flight arriving here and of a private plane from Austria. I suppose the Airlines need sufficient bookings in order to fly here. Local hotels only open on 1 July.
"Gabriela, does the medical insurance have to cover also COVID-19 related issues?"
"Travel insurance should cover Covid 19 unless your departing or hosting countries have formally stopped travel. If you’re travelling to Tanzania with a child, I’d recommend meningitis vaccinations too. Tanzania is not at higher risk of meningitis but time is of the essence. You may also wish to check that your insurance company will allow for medical evacuation to hospital in Kenya. Whilst you may get adequate care in a Tanzanian hospital for minor conditions, they are not comparative to what is available in other countries."
"Xelas: I only heard that a medical insurance is required, I don't know of any details."

"""Travel insurance should cover Covid 19 unless your departing or hosting countries have formally stopped travel.""We are not certain about virus cover on travel insurance at the moment, as it was declared an international issue, also business insurance claims was affected by lockdown."
@BinaI don’t fully understand your post but Covid 19 being an international issue has no baring on insurance. Obviously it’s always best to check with your insurer before travel. The biggest issue is to confirm you may be medically evacuated to another country for more suitable treatment. Of course that goes for all treatment not just Covid 19.
"Hi there, I want to book a trip to Zanzibar at the start of August but I need to get a Covid-19 test done before I leave the island and return to the UAE. Can anyone help me with where I can get this done? And how long will it take for the test results to be returned to me?"
Hi. You can check with Dr. Jenny of Urban Care Clinic https://www.urbancare.clinic They work closely with a lab here
"Hi,i bought a travel insurance 7 months ago, for 1 year. 7 months ago there was no Corona... so is it ok my travel insurance or i need a new one which cover Corona? Please advice at ovidiu.bernicu@esc-it.ro . Thank you!"
"Ovidiu, you should ask your insurance company directly."
"Apparently travel insurances of overseas companies don't cover Corona related issues. Petra, the owner of Mellow Moods Guesthouse in Bwejuu, Zanzibar, took the initiative and talked to a renowned local insurance company. They put together a package to cover tourists for Corona related issues. I cannot publish the email address here (my post will get blocked). You find it on the home page of www.zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.com"
"According to new directives by the Tanzanian government: ""All travellers whether foreigners or returning residents entering the United Republic of Tanzania will be required to present a valid NEGATIVE COVID-19 certificate from an approved laboratory in a departure country tested within 72 hours before travel. Upon arrival travellers with signs and symptoms related to COVID-19 may undergo testing."""
"Gabriela, I know of this new requirement. Thank you for setting it out clearly. Good to know it is 72 Hours before departure and not 72 hours before arrival. That makes a difference! What I am not sure about is if this directive is being applied now or if it will come into effect sometime in future. Do you or anyone else know this? I'm assuming it is already applicable as UK and Dutch governments, at least, have advice that the negative certificate is required but it would be nice to have confirmation."
"Jon D, my TO said she heard it is going to go into affect August 9 but she got conflicting reports about the ""notice"" and not sure if they will enforce it."
Im also curious about what kind of tests Tanzania will accept. There’s RT-PCR and Rapid antigen tests.
"Kayak has updated their advisory for Tanzania“To enter Tanzania, passengers must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test, performed within the 72 hours prior to boarding their flight.”https:/…tanzania"
Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority just published the following. https:/…
The new directive is already applied on mainland Tanzania and comes into effect on Zanzibar on 1 August 2020
"So who is supposed to check the certificate and where? The airlines, before boarding? Or some under-educated staff at the TZ airport? Don't tell me it's the latter!"
"""So who is supposed to check the certificate and where? The airlines, before boarding? Or some under-educated staff at the TZ airport? Don't tell me it's the latter!""According to airline or destination country, or both, Undereducated ??? You are talking about a country whose leader is the highest educated among the continent leaders, among the first to expose fake covid testing kits, among the first to support the ground breaking Covid treatment from African nation and among the first to open international flights,Globally, All those countries, reporting daily count of testing and positive cases to WHO, or bragging about quantity of beds, are mostly covering their own backs,It is all a fake show in support of WHO, globally, the public/civilians are asking where are all those beds and where are the test centres, and where are those figures coming from, and why the elderly care homes are not given any priority in covid testing,Some of the covid home testing kits have just been recalled or stopped, last week, in some European countries, too many fake testing kits around, WHO already admit covid will be around for decades to come."
"Is anyone able to update on the directive for entering the country? We are scheduled to visit early September but have been considering cancelling due to the uncertainty of being able to get Covid test results back within 72 hours. I am no longer seeing the directive for this requirement so wasn’t sure if it was lifted or not. We are planning to get tested before we travel anyway but if it’s not required, it will be much less stressful if for some reason we don’t have our results back in the required time frame."
"Hi Marcus,According to the latest news that I’ve received from my travel agent and also this forum, you are not required to do or present the Covid test unless your country of origin or the airline requires you to do so.HOWEVER, I have read some travellers have been asked to present the test on arrival.I am travelling next Monday, arriving at Kilimanjaro on 19th morning. In my case, I am coming from Hong Kong (does not require testing) and flying with Qatar (also does not require testing)... But as a safety precaution and just in case they ask, I will be taking the test before my travels - since it’s very convenient to obtain a test results within the 72hr timeframe here.I will update the forum next week once I arrive :)"
"I am confused about the COVID-19 test requirement, because I visited the Tanzania embassy at Washington DC website with a link to the following (that is dated from 5th August, 2020): https://tanzaniaembassy-us.org/wp-content/up… which states the following:""...the Government has slightly modified the Travel Advisory No. 4 of 20thJuly, 2020 and come-up with version No 5, effective from 05th August, 2020 to accommodate additional measures related to international travel as follows:.......2. All travelers whether foreigners or returning residents whose countries or airlines require them to get tested for COVID-19 and turn negative, as a condition for traveling, will be required to present a certificate upon arrival. Travelers from other countries with symptoms and signs related to COVID-19 infection, will undergo enhanced screening and may be tested for RT-PCR."" Where I am at in the USA, getting a COVID viral test is not a problem, but a 72 hours turnaround time is a challenge, as they typically say 3-5 days. If anyone can confirm that it's needed to be within 72 hours of departure, I'd really appreciated it."
