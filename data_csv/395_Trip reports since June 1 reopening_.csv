Has anyone traveled to USVI since June 1? I have a flight to STT for July 4 that was booked way back in November 2020. flying AASome details specific to me. I am 30 and traveling solo. I am very socially distant in normal times so spending a weekend eating takeout and swimming alone is the norm for me. Just really feeling overwhelmed by deciding if I should go or not. I have a reservation in a condo through Airbnb.
"Many people are visiting now, but they may not post trip reports. Only a tiny fraction of visitors post them.You should come as planned. No reason not to, but be prepared to wear a mask when entering most buildings, and to sanitize your hands at the request of some businesses."
I do hope the early visitors start to post reports.Only report I have seen is: Dept of Health - just 2 new reported Covid-19 cases since June 21 on STX 1 on STJ https://www.covid19usvi.com/covid19-report
"The incubation period of the virus is said to be 14 days. The new case comes exactly 14 days after the island re-opened to visitors and is noted as ""travel-related""."
Travel related could also mean that the person who got it traveled. No way to know.
Visitors here right now are apparently very happy to have got away to the islands. Those on St John are either particularly numerous or generally more vocal than those visiting the other islands but are voicing their delight enjoying beaches with fewer people on them and of course no cruise ship visitors.Those who live here will just have to wait and see what the results will be in the next couple of months as more and more people come and go.
I heard that the latest Covid-19 case is a resident who returned from a trip to Asia.
"As close as I stay to home I ""heard"" three different scenarios so far!"
"This is the scenario from the Governors website:""An email from the Health Department said one case was a returning resident to St. John from outside the territory while the other was a resident on St. Croix who had not traveled within the virus’ incubation period and was not a close contact of any of the other confirmed cases, therefore earning the designation “community acquired.”Edited: 10:35 am, June 16, 2020 "
"My family of 4 heading to stx this Friday. East end, desolate even when normal. Will update soon on arrival process."
