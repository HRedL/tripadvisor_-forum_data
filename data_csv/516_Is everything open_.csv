We leave in less than a week. Is everything open in the area?
Welcome to the Forums!Here's a link to the Chamber of Commerce website. Click on Covid-19https://grandhavenchamber.org/
"Most everything is open, but with restrictions."
"Most places are open, but musical fountain is not. Great outdoor dining options, many have added outdoor seating. Great sunset at City Beach. No Dog Beach, but dogs allowed at City Beach after 5pm on leash."
Yep everything is open
