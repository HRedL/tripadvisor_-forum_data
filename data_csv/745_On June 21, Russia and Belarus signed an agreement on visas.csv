"Tweets by ‎@VisitRussiaUKvisitrussiauk@VisitRussiaUKOn June 21, Russia and Belarus signed an agreement on mutual recognition of visas. Foreigners who have a Belarusian visa will be able to enter Russia and stay there until the end of its validity, similar rules apply to foreigners with a Russian visa to the Republic of Belarus."
"Now it's just to wait until consulates open after COVID-19 self-isolation...Maybe they are already functioning, can't say for sure"
"Should be the biggest news on this forum. I found Belarus visa process so easy compared to applying for a Russian visa. It’s like running 5K vs a marathon. I typically tell people not to freak out when they apply for a Russian visa, but I’ll gladly forgo the tedious process it involves. The only thing I want to know... if one gets a Belarus visa, does he have to fly through Belarus or can go straight to Russia?"
">>>I found Belarus visa process so easy compared to applying for a Russian visaI don't know what you were doing but I used a company which did all paperwork, I filled out their form and sent passport with photos and got my passport back with Russian visa within 3 weeks!! All with a similar cost to DIY.>>>> if one gets a Belarus visa, does he have to fly through Belarus or can go straight to Russia?I doubt very much you need to go through both countries each time you visit one of them."
"Belarus visa application was just two pages long. Unlike the Russian application, it didn’t ask where an applicant worked and lived going back 10 years, including names of supervisors and addresses of every single school one attended. It didn’t ask for a list of professional organizations and clubs one ever belonged to. Anyone with academic or medical background would find the last requirement ludicrous."
