"7 mates from Australia booked Flights and accommodation in NYC for Christmas Don't get me wrong I understand the severity of covid although in Australia we've been relatively unscathed. I'm getting so much information and tips and I'm a highly anxious person as it is and so waiting isn't my strong suit. We have paid in full for flights and accommodation for 2 weeks Looking for some advice from seasoned travellers and the reality of what it's been like in NYC I love your city, I want to support it and it's economy but only when safe"
"No one has a crystal ball to tell you what Dec. will be like BUT if flights aren't cancelled and you've prepaid, you may be forced to make the trip or lose your money. I would contact whoever you bought the flights and hotels from and see what your options are."
Thanks Yes we will lose out most of our money but I don't want to add to the problem so we might have to forfeitI understand no crystal ball...just gathering thoughts and ideas
"Did you book this before the pandemic?Airlines and hotels have been accommodating, so even if you had a non-cancelable rate, they may be understanding. December is a long ways off, so no one knows what it’s going to be like here."
"We have a family trip to NZ in December of this year.I'm planning on cancelling it in November because I don't foresee NZ letting us in without a 14 day quarantine. If you come to the US you should expect a 14 day quarantine on your return at the very least, because we are going to keep screwing it up through the rest of the year and the Pacific Bubble is going to be serious about keeping us out.The only way our trip happens is with a miracle vaccine and you should be thinking the same thing. Personally, I'd be a little anxious about visiting the country with a hundred thousand deaths and still going."
"What its been like in NYC is not relevant. The question is what it will be like in December and nobody knows that. Will there be a major second wave? Possibly. Could it be under control. Possibly. Nobody can answer these questions. What is certain is the virus will still be around in December. Whether or not NYC shuts down or its open but not a good time for tourists is anybody's guess. Probably won't even know until November. If you have to make any additional bookings you should make sure they are refundable. What you can do is look at what happens in the southern hemisphere the next few months. If things get out of control there then that may be an indication its going to hit the northern hemisphere hard next time we have winter. Not a definitive way to make a prediction, but its a factor you could look at to have some idea of what may be coming."
The speculation is that in the fall it will be worse.
I would wait and see. If the airline needs to cancel the flights you should get a refund or flight credit to use later. Your hotel cost is the big question though. If you need to cancel I don’t know if the hotel will refund the cost. Most have been doing it up until now but they might not be able to sustain it through to December if worst comes to worst. I’d still wait and see though. The situation is improving and if a second wave happens and you do need to cancel you’re no worse off than cancelling now.
"@4: I think the return of international tourism brings with it the very real danger of a resurgence of Covid-19 especially if, as is the current thinking, it turns out to be a recurring sickness like the flu or norovirus, known as the 'winter vomiting bug' in my country.The death rate of Covid-19 victims in NewYork has fallen below 100 a day, but how the City handles a reopening is one of considerable complexity."
"Looking at what's happening in Europe I get the feeling that everything is reopening as fast as possible as they want to get some tourism business this summer. People are very nervous about travelling but it enables businesses legally to avoid refunds and in some cases they are not allowing rescheduling of bookings eithet. If the plane flies or the hotel is opens,,,,,, Businesses are fighting for survival. Christmas is so far away that no one knows what will be hapoening then. Even if you can fly somewhere do you want to be on edge all the time worrying or surrounded by masks? Holidays to me are about relaxing and enjoying the moments, not santising everything around me,keeping my distance or endless queuing. But thats just me. The young - pre middle age - are relatively unaffected by this and they will travelEdited: 5:24 am, May 24, 2020 "
"What it has recently been like here is pretty awful - but hopefully it will will be better by the end of the year. What adjustments will be needed for the country and city to function more reasonably for residents and visitors is TBD and dependent on how things evolve or devolve over the coming monthsThere is a difference between being able to travel here and having the trip everyone was dreaming of once you arrive.. IMO the question is whether you will be able to do enough to make the visit enjoyableReview all of your bookings to see what, if any, options and deadlines you have for cancelling and getting a refund.Have you talked with your travel buddies to see if any of them have similar concerns?. I think you should discuss it as you will be looking to each other to have an enjoyable time or make decisions about changesP.S. If your accommodation is a short term rental (?) there are additional complications as the majority of AirBnB style rentals are illegal in NYC"
"We are travelling to New York in december to get married, we have our flights paid and we pay for hotel when we get there, its causing me awful anxiety what is going to happen, I think I am going to hold off cancelling anything until September, maybe have more of an idea to see what happens"
https://forward.ny.gov/ is the site to look at for the NYS reopening plan information and current status.
"I went ahead and canceled and picked a state that's opening for a late summer trip. I found a killer deal on an awesome place on the beach, so that helped..."
"September might be too early to know how things will look by December. The status of things in December will be largely determined by if there is a second major wave of Covid-19 that starts in the fall.Edited: 5:30 am, May 25, 2020 "
“Killer deals” scare the heck out of me in these conditions
"Do not cancel flights, unless they are fully refundable. If you wait for the airlines to cancel, or make a schedule change, you have more power to get your money back. Christmas is a long way away."
"Just to give you an international perspective, I help book dance companies & artists out of London, Berlin, Paris. We have cancelled all US travels until possibly spring 2021, and are trying to refocus in EU and on more responsible countries like NZ, AU. Its just terrible times in the US and for many reasons frightening with elections coming in the fall. México dance groups have rescheduled all European tours for 2021 at earliest, all US tours cancelled without further notice.I would carefully look at your details in your contracts, here is Quantas site which is good compared to others https:/…cancel-flights.html cancel what can be and pursue what bogwoppit suggests, watch what airlines are doing. I really like this guy Christopher Elliott, he is a consumer advocate in travel who has helped me in these issues: https://www.elliott.org/ Please everybody book 100% refundable in hotels!! You pay little more and can cancel, many will not even survive this and you will be SOL, blood from a stone situation. With airlines I would never buy 6-8 months in advance, buy like 3 months out max. They just are not stable now. There is likely consolidation coming and your tickets may well be changed anyway  - be proactive!! https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/ap…"
"Katy Sodapop, did you book yr airfare via an agent or direct with the airline; which airline are you flying with? I agree with a previous comment, if the airline cancels the flight, you may well get a refund, certainly Qantas has been doing that. If the Aus govt makes travel to the USA a no-go, the airline will normally provide a refund. Perhaps tell us which hotel you are at as some are better than others at providing a refund / credit note when necessary.It is difficult, but as you don't travel till December, you need to be patient to see what is happening later.You may have heard Dr Norman Swan talking about a possible 3 rd wave, never mind a second wave."
"""How complacency could trigger a third wave and force us back indoors"" Dr Norman Swanhttps:/…12270656""...I'm actually a little bit more worried about the potential third wave, because here's what could happen is you go along like that…this is presuming that there is no vaccine by the time we hit 2021. If authorities relax on testing, if we start to think there's no problem here, and if we get a cough or a cold we don't come forward for testing, or we defund to some extent the contact tracing regime and rely too much on the app, then I think we could get to a situation in 2021 which is far, far more dangerous than where we are at the moment.We are vulnerable, we are not highly immune. By the way, we wouldn't be particularly highly immune even if we had let it rip back in March. And if we let our guard down as individuals, as families, as communities and as governments, I think we could have a really bad third wave. So we won't have a bad second wave, but the third wave could hit us really hard because we've dropped the ball, because we've got bored with this, we don't think the problem is there any more, the contact tracing has fallen apart, we've let the quarantine hotels go and the infrastructure isn't there. If we do that, we are in shtuck.Tegan Taylor: So then the risk that we are looking at is, one, virus that's bad, and, two, we've let our guard down and it's a scalable problem.Norman Swan: Yes, we let our guard down and it takes off. And if we are slow to respond…and remember, when it takes off, the only thing that works is social distancing, it's the only thing that works. So that means in 2021 we've got to get back to lockdown, we've got to get back to extreme social distancing. That's going to be very hard to do, and there may be significant resistance against that. So that's the scenario out there that we've got to be worried about. I'm not that worried about 2020, but I am worried about 2021""."
"Chris Elliott and other travel experts say that you need to wait until your airline or government make it OK to cancel. Pulling the trigger too soon means you'll lose a lot of money when waiting and cancelling later after the airline tells you to do so, can save you the money."
"@Panch04, great input. I have a week booked in Guadalajara in late January, then 6 weeks in San Pancho. Booked way before the pandemic hit. Guad is cancellable and the other will be covered by my insurance. But I am holding off on flights. Originally I thought travel by xmas would be a reality, now I am feeling way less confident. We need a vaccine, that is not going to happen fast."
"The current flu vac is between 37 % and 50% effective depending on which strain it refers to. Personally, I am not relying on the COVID-19 vaccination to keep me safe.https:/…20200226interimfluve.html"
"Well herd immunity is sure not going so well. Covid is not flu, so comparing a flu vaccine to a SARs type virus vaccine is a bit weird."
"""Weird""? Good luck expecting the Covid 19 Vac to be perfect in it's cover."
"As an aussie you should know our borders are closed and most news / government releases have said this will probably be the case until early 2021...It may not be a case of whether its worth going to New York, it may be a case of our government wont let you leave or return.. and who knows what will be left after all the lockdowns are done in regards to flights etc"
"steveb2570, Indeed."
"So Sweetiedarling1, I’m assuming if things were normal you’d be in New York right now? This was my first May since 2013 not to be there. I got a Facebook memory a couple days ago of the night we went walking around the LES after dinner in Soho and saw the Banksy installation amongst other works of public art."
"This is my first spring in more than a decade without a visit; my last visit was my annual Christmas trip. NYC for me is Broadway, shopping and eating. I don't foresee a visit until this time next year, maybe later depending on when theatre can be safe and enjoyable."
"""Personally, I am not relying on the COVID-19 vaccination to keep me safe.""I agree! I never had a flu shot nor the flu and then one year I got a free flu shot and then got the flu."
"Does your country have a ""foreign office"" that advises citizens on issues relating to travel safety? If it does, the first thing you need to do is check that. If they, like the US Deot of State, are warning people not to travel, you should pay attention to that and keep in mind that any trip insurance you have or might buy will likely be at least partially, if not fully, invalidated if you travel in spite of any such warnings."
"QQ2, spot on. Currently our Foreign Affairs directive is do not leave Australia. Full stop. Come December, unless something dramatic changes with the US and its' handling of the Pandemic, can't see general tourists allowed to travel there from Aus."
"Oh, I bet you can travel here just fine.Getting back is probably going to be the bigger problem..."
"No, we can’t travel “just fine“. At the moment we are not allowed to leave the country unless we have a really good reason and it is very strict. Having a holiday is definitly not a really good reason:“ All overseas travel is currently banned, with few exceptions”. https:/…coronavirus-covid-19"
"Hi Scott, yep, like you, I should be in NYC. Hopefully again one-day. Very fond memories of the various walks and dinners that we have had when we’ve got together with some lovely locals and some out-of-towners. Hopefully next year."
"'I went ahead and canceled and picked a state that's opening for a late summer trip. I found a killer deal on an awesome place on the beach, so that helped...'I am disturbed by this. The pandemic is only beginning to subside. The thought of a crowded beach holiday in September is frankly scary and could well turn out to be a killer for some."
"#35:While you are right calendar-wise about when ""late summer"" is, the US media (and many people) think of ""late summer"" being August with the end of summer being Labor Day. A true ""late summer"" beach trip would be safer IMO as children in the US are back in school so family vacations to places like beach destinations would be over. So there would likely be less people on the beaches then especially during the week.Edited: 8:22 am, May 30, 2020 "
"Here in the U.K. children are also back in school and whilst the beaches might be less crowded, the attractions and shops are busy. I just don't think the old normal is coming back and a lot of people are not prepared for this."
"Things are changing so rapidly and unless there's a second wave I'm thinking international travel will be more relaxed by December. It remains to be seen how the US goes though, that may be one of the last countries allowed for travellers.There are travel bubbles already in place in other countries. The Baltic Travel Bubble, Greece is considering quarantine free entry for some countries, there is an Australian / New Zealand travel bubble being sorted out.The quarantine reason, if it's still mandatory to and from the US by then, will be the reason people will not want to travel there."
