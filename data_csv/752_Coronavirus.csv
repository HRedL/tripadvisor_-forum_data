WHO just elevated the virus status a few minutes ago. I have paid for a May 1st trip. What are other TA readers thinking?
May is a long way away. I sure wouldnt travel now tho.
Travel to Cancun now? Absolutely.This may be another fake crisis like swine flu and Zika.
"I'm not sure I would call Zika or the Swine Flu a made up crisis but whatever.....I can tell you that right now our State (Quintana Roo) is 100% Coronavirus free according the heath department here as late as this afternoon. I haven't been to the airport since it became a thing but the local news is reporting the officials at the airport are ramping up precautions. I'm not sure what those precautions are but I would have no problem telling my friends and family to come visit me. I think I saw on the news that the cases that do exist here in Mexico are in Michoacan, Jalisco and one other state far from here. And you've got time before you have to decide on your May trip. Many things could change between now and then but right now I'd come here in a heartbeat without reservation."
"If you are worried about another fake crisis and your trip is in May, you have way to much free time. That should be the least of your worries. You can worry about earthquakes, early season hurricanes, tequila shortages, etc."

"The possibility of contracting the influenza virus has never stopped me from travelling, so I’m not sure why it’s younger cousin the Coronavirus would. Influenzas infect millions every year causing tens of thousands of deaths. I see no reason to panic...take precautions and carry on with life. That said, air travel is one of the highest risk scenarios for contracting viruses so there’s that to consider(always). Just my opinion."
"""The case counts for each disease are in the thousands.""Wow. Thousands. When did you last hear about those pandemic killers?From google. Data not verified.""In total, the CDC estimates that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died.""""An estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications last winter — the disease's highest death toll in at least four decades. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, revealed the total in an interview Tuesday night with The Associated Press.Sep 26, 2018."""
I traveled during the swine flu scare in May. I was staying at the old ABR and they closed the hotel for 6 weeks the day after I checked out. Mostly I felt sorry for all the workers who got laid off. My van driver told me he and some of his friends thought it was a plot by Obama and the US media to get Americans to stay home and spend money there in the USA.
Is Ohio safe???
"""My van driver told me he and some of his friends thought it was a plot by Obama and the US media to get Americans to stay home and spend money there in the USA.""My recollection is that the US CDC portrayed travel to Mexico as very risky. Ever since then, I have little confidence in the CDC, their claims of a ""crisis"" or anything else that may just be a ploy to get more funding.Another statistic of vague accuracy: ""While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.""Current Chinese death toll from this bug is 219. A few hundred and not the tens of thousands who die of regular flu yearly....just in the USA."
"Years ago, I cancelled a trip to Mexico due to the “swine flu”. In retrospect, I shouldn’t have bought in to the hype. I leave for Puerto Vallarta on Sun, I’m going to Las Vegas in March & back to Mexico again in June. I plan to be diligent using hand sanitizer & Lysol wipes. I will not stay home on my couch worrying about the possibility of catching a disease. If I had plans to travel to China, then I would reconsider going."
"RU-OK-2, good idea with the Lysol wipes. Are they ok to bring an a plane to wipe down trays, arm rests.Btw I have never seen a lot of Corona in Cancun anyway. Isn’t it mostly Pacifico, Sol, Modelo Especialetc..."
"We always carry wipes in each carry on, on the plane. Wipe down the seat, arm rest, and tray. Some look at us like we are nuts, some have asked for one. One time a child threw up in the seat behind us. I gave the lady a wipe package and told her to keep it, she was glad to get it."
"We also bring Lysol wipes and wipe down every surface with which we come into contact on the plane as best we can. I will be using them on the plane and in my hotel room for upcoming travel. From people I know here in the Ú.S. who are working on the coronavirus, surface contact is the biggest concern with transmission, rather than it being airborne. It is believed at this point to be particularly contagious because it lives on solid surfaces (your unwashed hands and face included) for far longer than the few hours most other viruses and bacteria do. It can live for days.Edited: 7:06 am, January 31, 2020 "
"I have my Lysol wipes packed in my carry-on bag & ready to go! As soon as I get on the airplane, I wipe down the table tray & arm rests. When I get to my room at the resort, I’ll wipe down the tv remote, light switches, door handles, toilet handle, etc. I’ve heard that the most germ infested item in a hotel room is the tv remote."
"If I was pregnant, I wouldn't go to Mexico because of Zika. I think the chances of getting it are extremely slim, but it's just a short time of your life, and that is something that would affect your baby, if you did get it, so just no. But flu? I mean, that's all this really is, right, is just a different type of flu, basically? It sounds to me like it could make you very sick, but unless you are very young, very old, or have underlying health conditions - you'd most likely recover. Of course, you don't want to get it, but if you take reasonable precautions (or even if you don't take any precautions) the chances of getting it in Mexico are very, very slim. You may as well stay home because of possible bad weather, drowning, hang over, shark bite, food you don't like, etc."
"We are scheduled to leave May 7th for Breathless. Here is how I look at it. In one week we went from 1 case to 9000 cases. Lets say there is a two week incubation period, and lets also consider we didnt catch the first few cases, and call it a 9000 to 1 infection rate over the first month. If that holds true we would be looking at 81 million infected by the end of Feb. With a fatality rate looming around 2%, that would equal 1.6 million fatalities by the end of Feb. Which is why China has basically shut down their economy in favor of quarantining whole sections of cities. No one here expects that! Especially because like our experienced travelers have said, things like Lysol wipes, soap and hot water and a little common sense go a long way in killing viruses. While it would be ignorant to ignore the issue altogether, a wait and see approach is probably a smart decision along with doing our part to keep our families safe with good hygiene practices at home and in public, as well as on vacation."
"This is the worst topic/question I have ever seen on TA, congratulations."
"Hi All,To everyone who mentioned wiping things down with Lysol wipes on the plane and at the hotel/resort, this is an excellent idea. I actually pack wipes with me but I get so excited when I leave my house to head to the airport that I totally forget I have them in my carryon. I am definitely going to do this when I travel in August."

"I was checking out Apple Vacations today for an April trip to Cancun. Spirit airlines had an advisory notice up for the flight. ""Subject to government approval"" I thought that was strange No notice like that up for the Frontier flight."
"The USA has 8 confirmed cases now.  Mexico has zero. So....Technically, you lower your chances of getting the corona virus (struggling to not make a beer joke right now) by GOING to Mexico. ;-)"
"""struggling to not make a beer joke right now"" I know it is difficult right now!Really , I would have no concerns about traveling to this area now because of the virus. But I would be scared to be confronted with a Corona beer!"
"An announcement from Corona on my Facebook pageANNOUNCEMENTAgain, you don't get CoronaVirus from drinking our beerCORONASVIRUS symptoms include fever, running nose and coughingCORONA BEER symptoms include gagging, craving Taco Bell and limes, and waking up next to someone you wish you wouldn't haveEnjoy life my friends"
"""CORONA BEER symptoms include gagging, craving Taco Bell and limes, and waking up next to someone you wish you wouldn't have"". That's funny, I don't care who you are.Cheers!"
"Back to the OP on this one, the new form of the ""coronavirus"" wouldn't concern me as of this time in regard to travel within North America, including Mexico, though the virus will likely spread worldwide at some point. Thus far, the major health organizations appear to be in the study phase of this thing, emphasizing caution until they know exactly what they are dealing with while attempting to develop a vaccine downstream. In any case, I'd still be planning on enjoying the vacation. And, this is all JMHO. ;-)"
Wonderful. I leave for a trip to Cancun with my wife and kids on Sunday. Should I be worried? Bringing packs of AB wipes and masks?
"Paul, currently there aren't any cases of the virus in this state. I don't think anyone can tell you not worry. I live here and am using the wipes all the time now and carry that non liquid sanitizer with me. But am I worried? I'm not sure worried is the right word. Maybe cautious is better. I saw a news story over the weekend about a passenger who flew into Mexico City from LA after having been to China. He was here for two weeks and when he returned home he was diagnosed with the virus.The U.S. Health officials reached out to Mexico. Now in Mexico City they're contacting everyone they can find who may have had contact with him. Hotel and restaurant workers, Uber drivers, plane passengers etc. But they can't obviously find evetyone.That story did make me stop and think. We have people flying in and out of here every day. But so does every city in the world that has an airport. So while it did make me think I'm not panicked. I'm taking precautions and would urge everyone to do the same.As for a vacation, well, one going to Cozumel in 2 weeks. Kitts of cruise ships pass through there daily. I'm still going but will be diligent about washing hands and wiping down surfaces.I wouldn't go if there were cases of the virus there but there aren't.You need to make the decision you're comfortable with. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer here. Just one that you are comfortable with."
"i am thinking you are silly for even worrying about such a thing. First off, its not really a big thing outside of China. Second, read the stats, not the media hype. Wuhan virus currently has a 1% death rate. Those that are dying are the sick and elderly. Most people experience your basic cold/flu type symptoms and recover just fine. There are what...10 cases in the usa right now? Zero in Mexico. What exactly are you afraid of?"
"""i am thinking you are silly for even worrying about such a thing. ""And I'm thinking you have no right to pass judgement on what another person is concerned about. This is suppose to be a great place where people can come and ask questions and get other people's opinions and advice.

"Lol wow you totally misinterpreted that! The op says 'what are other ta members thinking'. And I am thinking its silly to worry about it. I would never considered silly to be an offensive or insulting word. Dumb, stupid, idiot, that's offensive. I am simply saying don't be silly, go enjoy yourself!! Sorry you interpreted that any other way."
"Ah, then apologies for assuming that. My mistake :)"
"Just another example how sometimes it difficult to interpret other's posts.Reading your second post I get you weren't being judgemental. I just needed to see in what context you were using the word silly.I used to use that word just as you did until I moved here. For some reason many people here equate it with ""being a fool"" and see it as an insult. So I stopped using it. Guess I really have become a Cancunense, lol. Apologies for the confusion!!!"
Thanks. All good. And Joan i am not nearly as experienced as you are on this forum so I will keep your advice in mind going forward. I don't want to insult anyone.
Don't go
Oh. “Don”t go”. Sage advice from a 1 time poster.
"Thanks for the update, we are in Mayan for March break so we are keeping a close eye on this."
"If you're concerned or have pre-existing health issues that would put you at a heightened level of risk if infected, don't go. It's your life and your money, and only you can make that call. Do your research, make a choice, and do the right thing for YOU.I am flying to CUN next week and staying in Akumal for 8 days. I thought about it too which is how I found this thread. I am not worried enough to not go, but wanted info. There are no known cases where I'm coming from, or where I'm travelling to, so with weather like I'm dealing with now, nothing can keep me from actual Corona's, Cenotes, and some of the nicest people in the world.Edited: 5:08 am, February 08, 2020 "
"It has been 10 days since my original post and I appreciate all of your responses (even the silly ones). It is clear the great majority of you would not change or cancel your vacations and I am moving into that camp. I will clean my tray table, window shade, seatbelt buckle and hands with disinfectant, and plan to enjoy my trip. The scariest part, to me, is the Immigration room where, on occasion I have stood for nearly and hour, shoulder to shoulder with 400+ people. I'll need to get over that. Thanks to all who took the time to respond."
"My trip is in 2 weeks, I wouldn't miss it. Unfortunately there will always be some concern. As a 40 year nurse, I have learned to use common sense & normal precautions, & it has served me well throughout my career."
Glad to hear this. We are headed to Cancun March 11-18th. Was concerned about travel.
"Seasonal flu is more dangerous at this point. Bird flu got my wife and I the cheapest trip ever to Mexico. But also the strangest. We went to Bahia Principe...was supposed to be Tulum, it had just opened. But they consolidated all 3 resorts to Akumal. There was no one there. We dragged our beach chairs into the ocean, it was awesome. Had to be less than 50 people throughout the resort."
"I will be traveling to Cancun this April with my kids, I pray everything goes well."
"NanSea, so true about standing in line going through immigration at the airport. That would be more of a concern than one plane and one resort. Apparently the plastic trays where you place your belongings to be x-rayed - carry-ons, shoes ( eww) etc. are the dirtiest things in the airport so a good hand washing after immigration is important. Go and enjoy yourself."
Thank you! I leave for Puerto Vallarta in May and this has been on my mind.
use enough wipes so that the surface remains visibly wet for 4 minutes.
Mexico has had no casesVery few cases in other countries
"I'm booked to fly out to Puerta Vallarta with my son in April and I have had the same concerns. The irony is that this holiday was booked on the back of a Thomas Cook refund!A lot has happened with the spread of the virus since January and I think that the situation is getting worse every fortnight.I think the only thing to consider at the moment is what the government of both the UK and Mexico are saying and leave it at that.Ultimately, if global travel is suspended, then maybe it is worth considering that our health is more important and that this virus is potentially fatal.Edited: 7:58 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"Last year, 35,000 people in the US died from seasonal flu.I'd be more worried about seasonal flu than the Novel Wuhan virus."
"I’m going in April with my 1 year old son, parents and grandmother in April too. I fear by then it’ll be more wide spread. Let’s hope this fizzles out or stays out of the Us and Mexico so we can enjoy time with our loved ones without fear."
"Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer while traveling and ALWAYS bring super strength oil of oregano. Hands down my forever cold and flu (or any bacteria) fighter! It kills all bad bacteria, viruses, and pathogens safely! I would never leave home without it. Apply a few drops to bottom of feet several times a day as needed or take the gel caps. It's a natural antibiotic and our family uses it year around... even on the kids! Flu shots? NEVER!"
"Hi guys. So I’m super upset my dad is advising me not to go to Tulum, I’m from UK and would have been flying from Heathrow. He said as I have a weak immune system it’s not a good idea as he doesn’t trust the media and a lot of countries that haven’t had confirmed cases as of yet would have it..."
Get yourself a hazmat suit.
Have you read all the posts in this threadWhat more can we say!!
It has been announced that it is a pandemic!

"In response to #10. Mark Twain had a saying that seems like a perfect fit for you. He said it's not what you don't know that gets you in trouble, but what you think you know that just ain't so. The difference with this strain of virus is you can be a walking carrier and not know your sick. Passing it on to everyone you make contact with without a clue. With a 2-14 day incubation period, no vaccine in sight for a year, and a death rate 10 times the typical flu, you might want to rethink your caviler attitude. Or you could pass your thoughts on to the lady in Ca who had no contact with anything close to a carrier and some how is now laid up in a hospital fighting for her life from this ""fake news"". Or you could continue to show off your ignorance and think it makes you smart. Hmmm sounds like like a President we all know.Edited: 2:39 am, February 28, 2020 "
It’s in Mexico now !!!! Scary stuff.. I’m meant to be coming from the UK next week I guess that is no longer :(
It will be in the UK by next week.
It already is
"""It’s in Mexico now !!!! Scary stuff.""Where did you get this info? And what part of Mexico?"
Do not fly till you know what the real truth is. Returning to USA can cost you your life!!!!!!!!! And it has nothing to do with politics!!!!!!!!!!!!
Joan. I assume you saw the link to the two Mexican cases in the other thread? One in Mexico City and one in Sinaloa. The case in Sinaloa has been said to be tied to someone traveling in from Italy. No news yet on where the MC case came from.
"I believe this virus is different because the number of reported cases are already consuming over 20% of the medical resources. I am flying to Puretra Vallarta in the morning. I plan to go on a motorhome trip once I get home to isolate myself. WHY? Because friends are so fearful they may contact the virus from me due to my spending time in airports. I am not letting the fear of this virus keep me from flying. I will take extra care. Wipes to wipe down assigned seat, tray, airborne before and during, face masks in case and much more extra cash in case I should be held hostage in isolation somewhere. Have my security code for my stick house to a friend in case I don't get home as planned."
"Yes I am thinking to risk it as I’m meant to be flying to Mexico City then cancun on Wednesday my parents are begging me not to go as they don’t want me put in quarantine, we can not say what will happen as everyday there’s something different."
"I am curious to see if they take my temperature getting off the plane in Mexico. My son works for an airline, I have a 21 YO GRAND daughter teaching school in Japan and another GRAND daughter working in Hawaii. I worry more about them. Just not ready to live in fear yet."
"""on what planet are influenza and Zika fake news!"" Agree with that! Really, I doubt any medical experts on his forum. Sometimes the DE designation must make them believe they are."
"I am tired of seeing the use of the word ""fake."" If you had the flu you might be arguing that big time."
People are ridiculous. How is people dying from this virus “fake”
"We are booked to travel in two weeks. I am not concerned about getting the virus, I am concerned about getting back into the country if the prevelence of the virus increases. My work and my daughter's school will not let us return for 14 days if the country we traveled to is on the list from the CDC"
Guys don’t risk it and stay home.. seriously.
"Maria, if you want to live in fear then stay home. How many people die from the normal flu each year in your country?It happens.Two cases in Mexico. TWO!On average maybe 30,000 people die from the flu in the USA. Don't travel to the USA.I would not travel to China now but I would not have six months ago either.Cancun tomorrow...yes.Next week...yes. And no reason to not go a month from now at this time."
"This is part of a post I posted on another thread but I think bears reposting here:I totally get that people have some tough decisions to make. Schools and work places in the US placing restrictions on when you can return to school or work if you travel to a high risk area may make the decision for some people. And, at least to me, that's totally understandable. But I think it's important to maintain a steady medium and not totally discount people's fears and concerns or the warnings put out out by the different government agencies (to me those people who do that lose all credibility) while at the same time not feeding the hysteria by posting unverified information as fact.In this situation (as in life) it's my opinion that an open mind and reasonable caution is warranted. And nobody should be mocked or made to feel stupid once they've made the decision whether or not to travel. That's a personal decision that nobody has the right to criticize. IJust my two pesos worth......."
"Agree Joan.We are due to leave in less that 2 weeks. At this point, my main concern is not being able to get back into the US or getting quarantined in Mexico. I doubt they will put us up at an AI, and if I did need medical treatment, I would want that treatment in the US.That being said, I'm not going to be really concerned unless we start to see a lot of cases in Cancun. It is a very fluid situation, and I don't think anyone knows where we'll be a couple weeks from now."
"We are booked through Costco for end of May in Cancun.... not sure what to do. The thought of being held in quarantine or worse, sent for treatment in a Mexican hospital, really frightens me. I think we can still get most of our money back, except for flights. Worried we’ll have issues getting back into Canada."
"I cancelled our spring break trip. For me it came down to the fact that Covid-19 is actually about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu according to the WHO, plus there are other issues like I don’t want to be potentially quarantined and I’m not sure if the tourist areas will have enough medical resources if the situation gets worse. I think the decision to travel or not depends on how important it is to you to travel right now. We were just planning to relax so that makes it easier to decide to wait. Disclaimer for the cheerleaders: I realize the odds of getting the virus are not higher in Mexico than any other travel hub"
Update: 4th case confirmed. News from Mexico. https://youtu.be/7NcS1mpHdhE

We are booked for a Spring break trip and are actively considering canceling it just as abundance of caution. The whole point of visiting Cancun is to have a relaxing vacation and if we have to worry every step of the way it just doesn't feel worth the hassle.

"Lol,People in Maryland would be excellent sources of advice. Great suggestion. We have Johns Hopkins, the National Institutes of Health, Walter Reed, the Biotech Corridor, the National Cancer Institute. This person from Maryland has been recommending the CDC website on this forum throughout and at no time have I suggested anyone cancel or panic.You, on the other hand, said you have no faith in the CDC and that “the health industry seems to like these ‘everyone will die’ situations.” You advised people not to trust any media reporting and referred to the CDC and WHO as the “medical industrial complex.” One of us giving suggestions is a fringe conspiracy theorist, and it isn’t the person from Maryland."
Some posts mention a fear of being quarantined in MX but this seems unlikely. Mexico's position seems oriented towards not disrupting international tourism which would mean not testing nor imposing quarantines (both of which would require considerable resources and logistics). Any threat of quarantine would occur when you're re-entering your own country.

"My trip is the last week of this month, I'm going to Cancun. You said that is safe rightnow?"
"Antemi, if you're asking if Cancun has any cases then the answer is Cancun has no confirmed cases.There are none in the entire State and the four cases Mexico does have are a long ways from here. Hope that helps."

"Thank you, Joan."
"@funinthesun Comparing the flu with corona is naive. Flu kills ~0.05% and corona seems to kill ~1-2%.Last time we had a virus in that range was the Spanish flu in 1918 which killed 50-100 million. And they didn't travel so much then.Corona needs to be contained asap, and dismissing the risks are not helping. Here in Kirkland, WA, we already have 5 deaths."
"The headline from post 97 is:""Health officials clarify Cancun, Riviera Maya region remain coronavirus free"""
"""The death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the U.S., according to The New York Times.In the study published Feb. 18 in the China CDC Weekly, researchers found a death rate from COVID-19 to be around 2.3% in mainland China. Another study of about 1,100 hospitalized patients in China, published Feb. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the overall death rate was slightly lower, around 1.4%. ""Source: https:/…new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.htmlFirst...Chinese death rates only apply there. Wait until you have adequate cases in Western countries. Then look at who is most impacted. Elderly? Underlying health issues that make them more vulnerable?I still see no reason to panic in this area or stop travel to Mexico (Cancun area). You make your own call."
We are also traveling to Riviera Maya in May and I had the same concerns. At this point I’m glad I purchased travel insurance but don’t WANT to cancel. Thoughts anyone?
"I think people fear all the people who will descend on Cancun in the coming weeks. It is a busy time there. I myself am booked for April. Some of the excitement seems to be gone in me, just the thought I guess of what could happen. There is some hesitancy now for people to travel. yes I have been dreaming of the turquoise water...….. what do you think?"
by the way isn't Corona a popular beer?
Considering I’m going over spring break I’m starting to think that what I should be saying is “oh my God it’s dangerous stay home.”That way it won’t be crowded. Because I’m going either waYI’m not sure why all these people think going to Mexico is so much more dangerous than staying home. Where do you live that you have found a way to completely lock this virus out. Are you just planning not to leave your house for the next six months?
The situation is Changing by the hour with this virus so asking now about future advice is difficult ...The single most worrying thing about Covid-19 is it’s infection rate and how easy it is to contact it apparently. Comparing this virus with seasonal influenza or anything else is rather misleading because we are in unknown territory here. My way of thinking certainly regarding travel now is whilst some parts of the world are still free from Covid-19 that circle is ever decreasing and a global pandemic is when not if now.
I agree that the situation with the covid 19 is changing by the hour and so we also should take precaution not to take unnecessary risks . Prevention is better than cure. We usually go twice every year to Cancun which is in April and October but this April we are sitting it out and hopfully in October we will have a better grip about of this virus. For us it not so much the resort we are worried about but it's the crowded airport and being in the aircraft for 5 to 6 hours . These are my thoughts and some may agree and some may disagree.
World travel at this moment in time is a difficult choice depending on circumstances. If I were 21 again and fit as I was back then nothing would stop me from travelling tomorrow. Unfortunately time catches all us up and given this virus apparently attacks certain age groups and general fitness differently that in itself will probably sway the final choice one way or the other.
"Interestingly, my upcoming Southwest flights to and from Cancun had been sold old for weeks. Now there are plenty of seats. I guess people are cancelling."
"We are booked for the 3rd week of May and still plan on going... as stated above in other messages, is it really any more dangerous there? I was at the grocery store yesterday with a 200 people at the very least. I'll go get lunch today and come into contact with another 1-200. This is a daily occurrence for most of us. I'm going to take the same precautions I take every flu season. Wash hands, not touch face (as much as possible), and take daily vitamin C along with my exercise regimen. No point in living in fear, but we all have to make that call for ourselves."
"My SWA flights are in March and just checked, everything is sold out."
"Interestingly, the young (kids) and fit/healthy can be carriers of this virus and not show any symptoms or perhaps only present as mild. They will therefore not be the targets for testing and be unwitting vessels of transmission. Looks like kids hanging with Grandma and Grandpa, who are more likely to present more severe symptoms, may be a problem. I have 2 concerns about staying at a resort and have been researching to see if these are justified. The question is can the virus be transmitted by ingestion, through food (the notorious buffets) or through water (swimming pools etc) like water getting into your eyes or up your nose?I found answers on food but nothing yet on swimming pool water as of yet. Below is a quote from a WHO paper.""Experiences from previous outbreaks of relatedcoronaviruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) show that transmission through food consumption did not occur. To date, there have not been any reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. However, concerns were expressed about the potential for these viruses to persist on raw foods of animal origin.""The takeaway for me is to stay away from raw or under-cooked foods of animal origin. As at now, my plans to be in Cancun in a couple weeks haven't changed. The risks, in my opinion, are same staying home vs going to Mexico.One more thing. The fit and healthy do not appear to have severe symptoms. One more reason to hit the gym and eat healthy :)"
"I just wanted to share on this thread, the same thing I shared on another thread..We’re going as well. There’s nothing that will stop us besides a travel ban or possibility of being quarantined - but those two things seem very slim. I have been watching the news and staying up to date.We’re taking our children who are young with us and have been in touch with our booking agency and spirit airline to just weigh our options. But I reassured my husband that we will be going and not cancelling. Obviously things change day to day. In Michigan we have zero cases (right now). I have been able to stock up on hand sanitizer, TONS of antibacterial wipes, and even taking antibacterial soap. I’m probably way over prepared and might need a third suitcase ha. We’re all pretty healthy and no underlying issues - so we’re not extremely concerned. I’m trying to remain excited and not worry our kids, who are overly excited!Just keep in touch with your travel agency and airline- take it day by day. I forgot to add on the other post- make sure you have travel notices on your bank accounts and credit cards. I previously worked at a bank and can’t tel you how many times people end up getting blocked from using these things — especially if an emergency comes up."
Stop itDon’t blame the mediaCorona virus is not FAKE NEWSSure it is not as deadly as the flu but it is easily spread and does kill
A must do if travelling during this pandemic is to register with the US Embassy/consulatehttps://step.state.gov/step/
"I received a response on my question about transmission of the virus through swimming pools. My fears are not justified. Here's the quote from a public health expert:""Water – and the chlorine – within swimming pools will help to kill the virus. What you’ll have to be mindful of are the interactions you have with others outside the swimming pool.""So back to standard preventive measures."
"I saw something on the news today that I thought I would share.A doctor was being interviewed and was asked about the effectiveness of using antibacterial gel. Her answer was so logical but honestly I'd never thought about it before.She said that yes, obviously it's effective in killing bacteria. But then she went on to say that while the bacteria on your hands is dead, it's still on your hands. So it's important to wash your hands with soap and water as soon possible after using the gel to get the bacteria off your hands. That's so logical but it just never occurred to me. Just thought I'd pass it on."
"Sounds very logical to me but I've never really thought about it. Its the little things we often overlook. My heath care providers have told me to always wash my hands under running water as the method of first choice. Hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol alcohol is a close second. Technically, antibacterial soaps/gels that do not contain alcohol will generally not kill viruses."
"Not to discredit anybody's statistics, because none of us truly know the ""REAL"" numbers the virus has affected. I believe the number are more accurate for the US/North America (including Mexico). You can believe what you want, but I believe that the number of cases in China is hundreds if not thousands more than the media is leading on to believe. Does it affect travel to Mexico? Some would say no. But some of the reports that I've read is that people are coming into Mexico City Airport and then traveling to the US. Who knows how true that is, but for me, I'm planning a trip to Cancun in May as well and I'm steering clear of Mexico City. Just flying in from California directly or having a layover in DFW. Good luck you everyone in there travels."
"LeidBack,Great reminder to register with the Step program. I just added my trip. Thx!"
"Hi Everyone,Our trip to Cancun is in 2.5 weeks, we're suppose to fly out on 3/22 and are debating whether we should go or not. My husband is panicking."
"Rose N, I am on the same boat as you. Leaving Mar 29 and getting worried. This has ruined my excitement of going. No travel insurance either. But I try to comfort myself and my fiance that there are less cases in Mexico than the US and its still far from Cancun."
"Rose - is he worried about exposure in MX? (I notice you are in Washington state). Or is he worried he could be exposed and can spread it further to MX? Or is he worried about being quarantined in the US once he returns? We aren't worried about exposure since we arent in our 70s or 80s but i feel like we are being a bit irresponsible traveling internationally. We don't think quarantine will happen soon in MX since they are likely not testing widely and they aren't eager to shut down tourism at this point. Our workplaces in the US may ask us not return to work for 14 days and have asked us to consider canceling. We are just waiting to see how things look in 2 weeks.Edited: 12:56 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"I think the biggest risk to travelling now is the possibility of being quarantined when you get back. But then, why would you be quarantined after travelling to Mexico that currently has a lower rate of incidence than the U.S.? A colleague at work is away for 2 weeks of vacation to Portland and Seattle. No mention of quarantine when he gets back. Thankfully, I'll be in Mexico when he gets back, and should be away for at least 2 weeks :) In my opinion, the incidence rates are very likely under reported, although not intentionally. We know that they are only testing those that manifest with symptoms. We also know that not all that have the virus present symptoms. In effect, what they are reporting is the number of people that have gotten sick/shown symptoms from the virus not the number that have been infected. One silver lining here is that children are much less likely to get sick/present severe symptoms. But then, they are the ones that get closest to more vulnerable adults. The panic is greater here in the States. In my locality, our Costco along with other major outlets are sold out of paper towels, toilet paper and Clorox wipes. There are restrictions on the number of cases of water you can buy. However, flights to Cancun are sold out. I have been trying to upgrade our seats but no luck."
"Curious, how many of you responding to this thread are Asian American? There's already xenophobia happening in the states towards Asian Americans. Our family has a trip planned during Spring Break and might cancel entirely. Not just because of the virus but the possible Xenophobia we might encounter in MX from locals and other tourists.It's something extra that us Asian Americans would have to consider before going."
"I am going regardless. I can get it at home, I can get it in Mexico. Chances are I won't get it either place. You have a better chance of catching the flu and dying that you do the Coronavirus."
"Jason T, I haven't thought of that much as I am Asian but traveling with 4 american including my 10 yo daughter. So, I feel like I might be able to disguise with them a little and hopefully nobody will give me a hard time during my vacation. Also, I haven't been to Asia in the past 3 years but again nobody knows that. Well, I am just hoping for the best."
I will post this in case it helps someone making their decision. This is from a friend who is a doctor. She replied to me...I'd still go - take precautions - wash hands regularly - don't shake hands. We will all get it eventually - evidence so far is children get a mild version and healthy adults recover. So far those that are dying are old with poor health. Risk is that if you are somewhere where someone is diagnosed with covid-19 is that you'll have to self quarantine for 14 days either at the resort or at home on return depending on where/when the contact occurred. Inconvenient but again not life threatening.
We are scheduled to leave for our trip to Playa Mujeres on April 11. My husband and I are on the fence about going. We're bringing our two young kids with us too For now we are seeing how things develop and will make a final decision soon. Luckily our resort has a liberal cancellation policy. We will however take a bit of a hit cancelling airfare. We are scheduled to drive up to Toronto from Western New York and fly direct from there to Cancun. Wish we were flying direct from USA instead as it seems like less of a hassle. Lucky we get the luxury of even taking a vacation.
I can’t find this anywhere but is Mexico restricting travel from China or Iran or even Italy?
"So those are you panicking and canceling vacations, are you still going to work shopping etc. because the truth is I think the only way to truly protect yourself would be to lock yourself in your house and have no contact with any other human for the next several months. The truth is it’s here, it’s where are you live and you probably are just going have to accept the reality of this.Edited: 8:05 pm, March 03, 2020 "
I have a group of 40 coming from canada and USA for a wedding. All east asian from different ethnic backgrounds and none of use have travelled to Asia this year. This will be... interesting. Also swine flu originated in mexico so you would think locals would be a bit more understanding.. but I doubt it. Hoping things will be fine!
im scared
We cancelled.
I’m supposed to be in playa del Carmen April 7th. We’re still on target to get there gd willing.
"""I can’t find this anywhere but is Mexico restricting travel from China or Iran or even Italy?""No, and that's extremely troubling. They should ban any foreigner who has been in these countries for the past 14 days. The US is doing that for China and Iran."
"Reporting live from Playa. It is business as usual here, no slowdown in tourist, most places i went to on 5th ave and off 5th ave tonight was packed or had people in there and no one wearing masks. I would say, as of this moment, Playa and Cancun and a Tulum are safe and I wouldn’t cancel my trip if I was coming anytime soon. As usual you should take your own precautions and wash your hands etc."
Staying calm here in the UK.Latest recipe of DIY hand sanitizer.2 tbsp Vodka3 tbsp aloe Vera gel15 drops essential oils.Try it...B.
@eric- I agree. If they stop allowing travelers from high risk countries I wouldn’t be so nervous to go. Cancun doesn’t have any cases yet so if they didn’t allow travelers from those countries to land I’d be less worried and just take extra precautions on the plane.
""" Our workplaces in the US may ask us not return to work for 14 days and have asked us to consider canceling. ""Savvychic this makes zero sense. Would they have you quarantined if you went to Seattle WA?I see nothing on the CDC website that suggests Cancun is a problem. In fact, excluding the four or so countries with the most cases, there are about 37 countries that have more REPORTED cases than Mexico."
"LeidbackIn regards to the swimming pools at the resorts. Chlorine is a tricky thing in a swimming pool. Its more effective at lower pH values. Its also dependent on how much chlorine is in the swimming pool. Sunlight can cause chlorine to burn out quickly. All factors to consider. The CDC sets the bar here in the US at 1ppm of chlorine and then lists kill times for different ""bugs"" common for swimming pools. I have been a certified pool operator for 20 years, so I have some experience with all of these bugs! So at a 1ppm chlorine will kill e coli in less than a minute, Hepatitis A takes about 16 minutes, Giardia takes 45 minutes. Hepatitis being the only virus in that group. Now a couple of notes. The more chlorine, the quicker the kill times. Normal pool operators will keep chlorine around 3 ppm, not 1 ppm. So most viruses will be killed off in a pool in less than 5 minutes, at a chlorine reading of 3ppm. I cannot speak specifically to CoVid19. But I would feel safe getting in a pool with a good chlorine reading. I would make sure to stay in the pool for 20 minutes or longer to know that anything on me would be killed by the chlorine before I got out. Resort pools are also routinely ""shocked"". meaning they bring the chlorine up to 10 or 20 ppm overnight to make sure they are clean at the start of each day. You can imagine any of these ""bugs"" will give you the exact same symptoms as say food poisoning or in Mexico, Montazuma's Revenge! This is a bad look for resorts, especially in MX with the water issues of the past. So they pay extra special attention to the pools. My advice is to enjoy the pools, but stay away from a pool that is hazy, cloudy or visibly dirty.Link to the CDC chlorine in pools kill time charts.https:/…disinfection-testing.htmlEdited: 10:49 am, March 04, 2020 "
We are going April 13. Can’t wait to go. Wash hands and cover face when coughing.
Justinekinne -- thanks for the informative post. Going off topic but what about Hand Foot Mouth disease? I've read complaints of kids getting this from resort pools and I've always been confused how the chlorine doesn't take care of this?
Very interesting and informative post justinekinne; thank you for that.Interesting that Giardia is not killed off that easily .... and how the symptoms thereof appear to line up quite nicely with reported tummy issues that we often see on these forums.
"Actually Copilot, major employers are beginning to request cancellations of non-essential domestic travel as well. Conferences in Chicago are being canceled, etc. This virus is disrupting life as usual whether I like it or not. I really want to go on my vacation this month just like everyone else but things are going to get worse before they get better. When the entire country of Italy shuts down all its schools for 2 weeks, it's getting kinda real."
"Major companies are doing it so they don’t get sued and blamed if illnesses happen. They aren’t asking for you to cancel your personal trip. If anything some will ask you to stay home, if you traveled to a hot spot. Which, again, Mexico isn’t considered one."
That’s stupid ... go on your trip. There are 3 cases in Mexico. There are cases in the US. The chances of you actually getting it are low..
"Maegan -- all the management (CEO, COO, CIO, etc) at my husband's work canceled their personal Spring Break travel plans and requested that their employees do the same. It's just a request. It doesn't mean that you or anyone else has to cancel their travel plans, I'm just sharing what's happening in some parts of the corporate workplace."
"Justinkinne - Thanks for the detailed information on swimming pools. It's reassuring to know that Covid 19 risks appear not to be significant across the two major communal locations at a resort ...swimming pool and buffet. Prevention comes down to wash your hands frequently, don't touch your face, cover you mouth/nose when you sneeze etc."
"Tough call, what does your gut tell you?"
"It's gonna be crazy! Just went to WestJet website and checked in. I thought we will get a flight nearly to ourselves. Jeez, almost full house!!! Only a few seats left!!! My partner and I will not sit together... :("
"""That’s stupid ... go on your trip. There are 3 cases in Mexico. There are cases in the US. The chances of you actually getting it are low..""JLO, whether or not you think it's stupid it is happening. Now people have to factor in the potential of having an additional 14 days off work or school of they come here and while they're here Mexico goes on the list of high risk countries.Is that going to happen? Who know? I hope not but it could. It's troubling that Mexico hasn't out any restrictions on flights And passengers coming from extremely high risk countries like China and South Korea.  And for some people that 14 days may be without pay or may eat up sick days, personal days or remaining vacation days. It is something people are going to have to think about."
"I haven’t heard anything about there being any alarm bells ringing about going to Mexico. That said, if your trip is in May, it may be too soon to say. Although unknown at this point, experts say there is a possibility we could see a respite from the virus in spring and summer. It still remains to be seen. We are traveling to Playacar at the end of the month and have no plans to cancel at this point. We will monitor to see how things evolve over the next couple of weeks. I would be more worried about a trip to Florida for spring break where masses of students will be. They are looking into more cases in Florida now, but even then, I was only able to find one news source from a local paper that recommended students reconsider travel to Cancun or popular destinations in Florida. It seems rather alarmist and premature to cancel at this point. The source was concerned about masses of students in close proximity having massive pool parties, etc. Mexico so far has not banned travel from the US. Too soon to say what will be the case in May. I hope you are able to enjoy your trip!"
"I'm going this month and nothing is going to stop me! I'm from Nebraska, we have the number 1 biohazard facility in the nation and they are bringing patients here for quarantine. Get me out of here ! LOL....wash your hands and don't touch your face. It's all we can do!"
"mwhite, I am with you!I noticed on the National news the other night that Nebraska was in red with confirmed cases.....Well, that is not completely true. No confirmed cases of Nebraska residents (yet)....just the folks being shipped here for our Bio- containment/quarantine facility."
Reading that travel insurance will not cover this anyway...
There are no coronavirus cases in any of the tourist destinations outside of Mexico City which does get tourist also. That said there have been none in the Yucatan so I would not be concerned and would not let fear dictate your life when the chance is very remote of getting anything.I know there is always that fear that a rabid infected Chinese tourist will kiss you but its really unlikely.
Have good and safety vacation
"I’m the same. Due to fly from UK-mexico city-cancun on the 1st April. I’m not too concerned but partner and family members are pushing to cancel! I will be more cautious during transit, using hand gel and increasing hand washing more than usual and using AB wipes for when on plane. Partners worried about contracting it during our holiday and it being ruined! The chance Of that happening is far too low for me to consider not going or cancelling unless the early airline does so itself."
"I'm heading to Cancun April 4..I'm taking all necessary precautions, I've worked in the medical field for over 40 years.. I'm will enjoy my beach, sun and relaxation...."
"We’re in Bacalar right now- have been through Cancun and playa del Carmen, spent a week in Cozumel and will heading to Tulum. It’s all fine at this point. It’s just as likely you’ll be exposed to the virus at home, so take your trip & relax, and WASH Your hands, Don’t touch your face."
"We’re down here now, no problems at all. You’re just as likely to be exposed to the virus at home, so relax and enjoy your trip, but be diligent about washing your hand and not touching your face!"
"I agree! I have my wedding on May 2nd... Through sickness & in health, right? lol"

"Preparations for our trip to Mexico in less than 2 weeks is becoming quite the adventure. Every store in my locality and beyond is sold out of hand sanitizer.

"NanSea123: If your travel date is May, just take a “wait and see” attitude. You have plenty of time. Two months is a long time. JoanS is a Destination Expert (who actually lives in Cancun) so she would know ‘first hand’ what is going on at a ground level. Trust me, if things go south all governments in Canada (where I am from) and the U.S. will register Mexico as a country that should be avoided. And the numbers just aren’t there and may never be. So take a deep breathe and be proactive and follow the advice of people “in the know”."
"Leidback: You ought to believe it’s unbelievable and I’m from Canada and there is NOTHING. everything is gone and it’s unbelievable. I got some Lysol wipes but forget hand sanitizers they are gone. So, like you, I am making my own ‘home remedy ‘ for my plane travels. Alcohol is a great disinfectant. My secret formula will remain secret (big brother is always watching) but I’ll give you a hint - Tequila cures everything!!!!!"
"Jbwillowitz: I AGREE absolutely. Trust that people ‘in the know’ know what is happening ‘on the ground’. If you are a Destination Expert who is actually living in Cancun, then at ground level you see with your own eyes what’s ‘really happening’. Read JoanS posts, she is in the know as she lives there. Cancun is safe, and I am a senior that is going for 2 weeks on March 30th, and I’m not the least bit worried. Paradise Here I Come!!!!Edited: 4:54 pm, March 06, 2020 "

"@ Arlene S, going by the science, alcohol is the active ingredient that kills corona viruses, and you need something with at least 60% alcohol content. Most locally available Tequila is generally 40-50% so doesn't quite cut it. I went for the big guns, 151 proof rum and spirits which is about 76% alcohol. I have an old bottle of Sierra Silver 150 proof Tequila, but that's strictly for sanitizing my internals :)Edited: 5:20 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Leidback: I know , I watched CNN today, but a ‘lady has to do what a lady has to do’ and as they say ‘desperate times calls for desperate measures’ ha! ha!Besides, tequila not only will cure what ailes you, it tastes GREAT!!!"
"Leidback have you checked your local dollar stores? I started to stock up a few weeks ago knowing once the first cases in the US happened things would go crazy. WalMart didn’t have any toilet paper today, barely any cleaning supplies. Target was out of sanitizer but I grabbed a few big things of wipes (just for our houses). I was got sanitizer last week though.The dollar tree store had a ton of antibacterial wipes and sanitizer though!"
We are flying to Cancun on Monday. Has anyone who has recently been in Cancun seen changes at the all inclusives with the buffets or public areas? We usually bring our own insulated drink containers and likely will do so again. Please advise if there is anything else we should pack.
"Leidback: Ha ha too funny! I would certainly keep the Sierra Siver 150 proof Tequila. If we have to poison ourselves, I can’t think of a better way than 150% proof."

Plenty of wipes, hand sanitizer, etc. Been reading about the uptick of Asian and European visitors to Cancun. Mexico airports don’t seem to be doing anything. Bottom line it’s there tourism dollars. We’re just going to do the best we can and not worry about it. I did purchase medical travel insurance. $1mil on both medical and med evac if needed. Nice price through Seven Corners. Peace of mind. Return next Thursday through Atlanta where I’d be more worried in the customs line. To good times, fear is not an option, it doesn’t rule, looking forward to warmth."
"I might add, we bring our own snorkeling gear. lol Always have. Just in case you snorkel, peace be with everyone."
"On the local news today. They announced the first confirmed case of Corona virus in Minnesota. An older gentleman had been on a cruise and when he returned, came down with a respiratory ailment on Feb 25. He went into the hospital yesterday and a positive diagnosis was confirmed today. The million dollar question on my mind is this: what happened between Feb 25 and March 5th? Am I crazy to assume the horse has already left the barn?"
"Hi, I just came back from Cancun. We didn't stay at an all inclusive, but had no problems at any of the restaurants. I will say that neither flight back home was full- (Cancun to Fort Lauderdale and then on to Atlanta.) I took wipes/ sanitizer and washed my hands a lot! No issues."
We also have a Cancun visit scheduled for that week and we are watching carefully as that is right after their high season.

Yep. We're headed down 1st wknd of april. Hoping sick people make smart choices not to travel. I dont want to cnx the trip. We live in seattle area so the risk is already present here so i dont feel like cnx is going to lower it.
Enjoy your trip. We leave april 4th. Hoping this will simmer down by then.
"We have a booked trip for May also. I am in the high risk category, so just watching for now. I hope this virus is like the flu and will fizzle out by May. (Flu season normally ends in April). If not, we'll have to make a decision--I'd really hate to be sick in a foreign country. And hope my credit card's travel insurance will cover my costs."
"Same! We are going to Akumal (a little south of Playa) on the 4th. Concerned yes, but not willing to cancel."
There is one confirmed case in Cancun. Traveled back from Italy.
@norapforty do you have a link to an article? Or anything confirming that?

With all the cruises that make stops in Mexico it seems likely there are more cases than what is known.

"Re: Post 193...Joan, that report is from January. I recall reading it at that time, and it was later concluded that it wasn't COVID-19."
"Here are the confirmed cases in Mexico so far...On 28 February, Mexico confirmed its first three cases. A 35-year-old man and a 59-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the northern state of Sinaloa tested positive and were held in isolation at a hospital and a hotel, respectively. They both had travelled to Bergamo and stayed in Italy for a week in mid-February.On 29 February, a 4th case was detected and confirmed on the city of Torreon, in the state of Coahuila, from a 20-year-old woman who traveled to Italy.On 1 March, a 5th case was announced in Chiapas in a student who had just returned from Italy.On 6 March, a 6th case was confirmed in the State of Mexico in a 71 year old man who had returned from Italy the 21st of February.On 7 March, a 7th case was also confirmed in Mexico City in a 46 year old male who had previously had contact with another confirmed case in the United States."
Thanks MisterB. I asked that it be removed.
lol....fake news
"Anyone who thinks that the coronavirus is a hoax is most probably a person who doesn't believe in science. Because it's important that the virus doesn't spread, people should take precautions, but this virus doesn't seem to be as dangerous as some others, outside of the elderly. Who wants the flu? It's not fun. And its consequences are reaching, lost wages, schools closed, businesses affected because people are too sick to shop, etc. This virus can cause a lot of people to get sick -- why not just take precautions and not get the flu/virus?"
My trip to Puerto Vallarta went great. No problems. Four flights total round trip and no extra precautions. I sanitized motel room and seats on the plane.
"We have a family trip scheduled in early April of this year to Occidental XCaret, RIviera Maya. Bought it through Costco Travel. We are hoping that we can reschedule the trip as my parents are elderly and high risk. We do not want to take a chance. Has anyone had success rescheduling trips with Costco Travel? We are flying with Delta.I have not heard about the Cancun case, but it is good to know. That reaffirms that my decision is the right one. Fake news or not, Elderly people are dying of it everywhere. I want to protect my parents.Anybody rescheduling trips? Thank you."
"Andrea,I actually had a friend post Costco was giving people issues on rescheduling or changing their vacations. If you have travel insurance that’s one thing but if you don’t you’re best calling Costco or Delta. I have read/heard delta is waiving fees! Not sure all the fine print though. Also just from me chatting with our travel company to see what they were offering — since Cancun isn’t a hot spot for the outbreak they weren’t waiving fees + we would be charged for our hotel cancellation. Again this is just chatting through email I didn’t personally call them. Maybe if you speak to a supervisor and explain the situation as you have someone high risk - they would be waiving more fees for you. Everything is case by case I’m sure."
My wife and I are going to Cancun tomorrow.
"""I have not heard about the Cancun case, but it is good to know. ""I repeat: THERE ARE NO CONFIRMED CASES IN CANCUN OR THE STATE OF QUINTANA ROO.Please STOP posting that there are. You aren't doing anything but spreading disinformation. Andrea SW, this is NOT directed at you. I know you were only reacting to what someone else posted. And for what it's worth, if my parents were alive (they'd be in their 80's on the high end) I wouldn't want them travelling right now either. It's not about coming here, it's about the airport, the plane etc and being in the high risk group."
Thank you. No worries. I do not feel offended. :) I appreciate the clarification. Are you worried about the the crowds of spring vacationers bringing it in?Thank you.
"Thank you Maegan. Good suggestions. I wish I did not have to change the trip. I really need a vacation .That is too bad about Costco. They are known for their excellent customer service. Also, I have heard that most travel insurance does not cover of ""fear"" of contracting the virus. You need to b e physically ill."
Hello thomastW559CSCan you please let us know what is going on there? Have a safe flight and a fantastic vacation. Thank you.
"""Are you worried about the the crowds of spring vacationers bringing it in?""Honestly, no. I'm not saying that's not a possibility but quite frankly they aren't a high risk group and chances are haven't been doing any international travel. And they don't pose any greater risk as a carrier than anyone else. Spring breakers do come with some problems but for me, anyway, those problems don't include the Corona virus."
"JoanS: Goodness gracious, you have the patience of a saint! With all this ‘misinformation and non facts’ being posted every every minute, every hour, every day, I don’t know how you keep your sanity, but you are managing to do so, ‘against all odds’ - so good for you!! As a Canadian, our situation in terms of dealing with this pandemic may be different, but at the end of the day, ‘’We Are All In This Together”. Joan, my advice to you is “common sense”, just report “what the facts support” and ignore the misinformation that is out there!!"
"""JoanS: Goodness gracious, you have the patience of a saint!""Lol, this is so NOT true. Patience is one thing I don't have much of although it has gotten considerably better since living here. It's really a necessary mindset here."
"JoanS: And as we all know, “mind set is everything”, so keep up the good work! Any info you can provide on the Cancun Airport and if they are taking any precautions with ‘arrivals and departures’ would be much appreciated."
How can you say that? FAKE???????
This whole thread has taken a turn. I can see why new ones have been started
I'm seriously concerned. I contacted both the resort we're booked at and our travel provider. I would love to know just how resorts are preparing or have prepared for the coronavirus.
"In Italy people ARE DYING.STOP thinking and saying it's fake news.Try to listen and read what is really happening in Europe.If in USA or Mexico there are just few cases is because they have to pay yo see if they are sick. Moreover, CANCUN AIRPORT IS NOT ANY MEASURES OF CONTROL TO CHECK IF THE PASSENGERS ARE SICK OR NOT.Here is not as safe as you imagine. Here there's just more disinterest and disinformation.By an italian girl who lives in Playa del Carmen"

The local authorities are underplaying the virus in this area. No measure taken at airport to check for potential people with virus who are either arriving feom Europe South Corwa or Italy. It will not take long for virus to spread like wildfire in Cancun or Riviera Maya. I would postpone any travel to our area until cirus is under control.
You must be kidding this is an epidemic and we will soon be a focus of the virus as no preventive measures are taken at airport.
"Kate G, your posting is the most intelligent one yet posted.Thank You.Edited: 12:49 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I have lived in Cancun for the past 20 years and know how authorities work here. Thanks
Yes typical of local authorities denying any possible case.No measures implemented at airport to check arrivals or sepatures. So how are you supposed to determine and or stop the spreading. I am not a negative person only a realist and who is kidding who.
"In addition to Kate's wisdom, I submit a copy of a posting by Joan S. from the Isla Mujeres forum:https:/…index.html"
Well that just means you can get it anywhere in the world. Even wherever you live.
Agreed!
"Haven’t cancelled trip...yet. Not sure what to do. Leaving 3/18! I read there in no problem in Mexico with virus, but spring break brings people in from everywhere. WHO put us in preparedness alert mode, but travel to Cancun has not been restricted"
Well trump just canceled all flights form Europe after Friday. This is a lot of our fears. Imagine being in Mexico and not being able to get a flight back before a ban like this goes into effect?
We are also scheduled to leave DFW for Cozumel on 3/17 and haven't cancelled our trip either...wondering what to do...Mexico has only like 3 actual active cases out of how many million citizens? I really want to go but don't want to get stuck for a month...of course it sounds like we would have some advance warning as the folks in Europe are getting with the two days to get home.
""" Imagine being in Mexico and not being able to get a flight back before a ban like this goes into effect?""Europe has been a growing hotspot. Cancun is not even on the radar as a threat."
"Yes, things are changing quickly. Lots of Europeans travel to Mexico, it makes we wonder if there are more cases out there. Just announced that Tom Hanks and his wife tested positive in Australia. I also wonder if people in Europe will simply travel to the UK to get into the USA.Edited: 9:44 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"This travel ban with Europe (not Britain) is not unexpected. Mexico has minimal cases and the Cancun area none that I have heard of.Even if a ban is implemented, US citizens could get home. Refer to the cruise ship passengers in Japan (?)You may encounter a quarantine when you get home but I see no indicators of that happening with Mexico at this time."
"Spoke with our travel company before our trip and they reassured us even if a ban did take place the airline would still get us home. I can’t imagine American citizens just being stranded, if you’re willing to go back."
"Details, details, details. Did we forget the part where he said the restrictions would not apply to the U.K. and there would be exemptions for American citizens who have undergone appropriate screening?"
"@leidback,Saw this on an article.What this means: Americans and US permanent residents who are in Europe will still be allowed to fly to Europe and be allowed back into the United States during this 30-day period. They will simply be screened upon entry to the United States and face quarantine or restrictions on their movement in the US for 14 days."
The finer details are coming out.
"Quarantine/ restrictions if screening raises red flags. He also said cargo is exempted at which point I rolled my eyes. The virus can potentially survive 9 days on hard surfaces, but no, business must not be hindered."

"I must try one more time to convey the real danger with Covid-19 transmission.- It has nothing to do with the number of identified cases in Mexico.- It has EVERYTHING to do with the crowds in the international airports, in the planes themselves (miniature cruise ships, breathing everyone elses' ailments, trusting that the airlines are actually disinfecting all the surfaces...), the crowds in baggage claim, the crowds in customs, .... crowds in general, from who knows where ... - Maybe you will contract a dose and hopefully recover beautifully ... but how many people will you transmit it to that may not be as robust as you, that WON'T recover as beautifully.....This Is Going To Get Worse. I'm not crying Wolf; I'm reflecting the views of the vast majority of non-political medical authorities.Reschedule your trip until this clears up.Edited: 12:13 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Okay people lets think rationally. Those other viruses we already had vaccines for or knew what antibiotics and treatments would kill it. This is just being trialed now for corono-virus if the elderly get this or people who already have a respiratory issue it will floor our already over taxed hospitals and cause a crisis. And most elderly are vaccinated against the flu and pneumonia and people still die. That is what makes this so scarry but you know do not listen to me I have only been in yhe medical field for 30 years.
"Does anyone manage to cancel trip, that wasn't insured?"
"Following this.. Have a trip booked to Cancun 4/4 and unsure what to do. I have a 14 day cancel policy on my room. Worried if I don't cancel and my flight cancels after the cancellation period, I'm stuck paying for a hotel with no way to get to it.."
"I also have a trip booked for May 2nd, watching and waiting, evaluating the risks. Stay safe, wash your hands, wipe down things before touching them. Know the facts, this isn't the first flu nor is it the worst to date."
What about now! My trip is tomorrow and debating whether or not if it’s safe or not?
"You're right, Audrey ... as relates to this hemisphere, the Spanish Flu of the early 20th century was worse ... what was it, 300,00 fatalities?BTW ..... this isn't the flu."
"Zeni,If you do not have a travel ban you will most likely be losing out on money from your trip. There’s no advisory for Mexico so many agencies aren’t giving credits or refunding- at least the hotel portion."
@zeni- I did. My hotel at paradisus was non refundable however they did the exception. Hotels are being kind. My suggestion would be to be kind to them and flexible as well since they are loosing business and they will work with you. We had southwest flights so got our money back. My parents had delta so got their miles back. I can’t say the same as avianca. They didn’t reimburse my family members flight. They won’t even answer the phone.
"Familyofthreetravelers, a lot of work on your part, but you did the right thing.Well done."
Spanish Flu of 1918 infected around 500 million and killed an estimated 17 to 100 million depending on what you believe.
What is the situation now--March 12? We leave on Mar 21 headed to Playa Mujeres. It's major melt-down in the states today?
I dont thimk anyone should compare this to spanish flu which was years ago without the same medical advancements and knowledge..This was a good explanation https://youtu.be/lAtAd6_Wh9Y

"We were scheduled to leave March 22 (two adults + teen daughter) staying at Sunrise Moon Palace in Cancun. We DID pay the refundable rate and Southwest which means every cent will be refunded IF we cancel. We are leaning toward canceling our trip based on developments over the past 24 hours (Trump travel ban and significant state /local restrictions being introduced) . Schools around us are closing for 2+ weeks. Disney is closing, etc. My biggest personal concern is the air travel, airports, customs/immigration, etc. Also, we've been to the Moon Palace a couple of times and there are always loads of brits and other international travelers. I know there have been no reports of cases in Cancun but that's not the issue. It's the risk (perceived or real) that increases within high traffic and close proximity areas as mentioned above. Even though my family is low risk (age and good health), I'm concerned about impacting others around me (older family members, children, etc.) when we get back. Yes, I understand the 12 day isolation thing, but let's get real - that's tough when you have responsibilities (work, life). Just my two cents. Also, I do not want to be worried about the guy next to me sneezing at the buffet breakfast or the wonderful pool servers not washing their hands. These thoughts/concerns WILL affect our enjoyment; there is simply no escaping the cluster f&%k that is happening globally. Hope this helps others contemplating their trip.Edited: 9:49 pm, March 12, 2020 "

"I live in British Columbia, Canada, and our province has today issued a ""do not travel anywhere"" advisory, I'm booked for Ocean Maya Royale in Playa del Carmen through Expedia, trying to contact them to see what their cancellation policy is, keeping my fingers crossed. Flights were booked as non-refundable but I'm hoping they're being flexible in at least providing a credit - that's next! All very frightening."
The news here is reporting there are now 16 cases of the virus in Mexico and 82 suspected cases. The government officials are saying that Mexico will not close their borders for incoming flights or for land entries.
"I'm in Alberta, I had no luck to contact Expedia. All phone numbers are shout down."
"""I'm stuck paying for a hotel with no way to get to it..""Call the hotel and ask."
"For those who are interested- obviously I’m not a local! But we are here on our trip. On our flight - it was booked, people were everything down and even the flight attendants were great at how they handled drinks/food. No screening for us (we came from Michigan).Our hotel is always cleaning, extra hand sanitizer around as well. We have ate at the buffets even. No one is walking around coughing, sneezing, looking ill. Of course people can be carrying the illness with no symptoms but that’s a chance you have to take even at home.I have my mom back home preparing for us as much as she can. The shut down all schools for 3 weeks, my daughters district is shut down throughout her spring break. My husband might have to end up working from home anyways (they were discussing with all employees leading up to the trip).Trying to keep focus on our trip and enjoy it though. Our children are going to have to adjust to a new normal for awhile which will be hard on them."

"In today's Riviera Maya News:Ministry of Health says claim of coronavirus in Cancun is falseBY RIVIERA MAYA NEWS ON MARCH 13, 2020Cancun, Q.R. — The Ministry of Health says a letter circulating across social media claiming a positive case of coronavirus in Cancun is false.The head of SESA (Secretaría de Salud Quintana Roo) responded to the circulation of the letter, referring to it as fake news, reminding the population to better inform themselves through official means of state health authorities.The announcement came from SESA head Alejandra Aguirre Crespo, who posted the reaction on social media, confirming that the official data of Covid-19 in Quintana Roo still stands at zero confirmed cases.She explained that from February 28 to 7:00 p.m. Thursday, March 12 there have been a total of 17 suspected cases, 12 negative and five under study.She says a false letter on SESA letterhead that appears signed by state the governor claiming a positive case of coronavirus in Cancun is completely false, calling it an apocryphal document.“Until now, no case in Quintana Roo. In all the suspected cases the corresponding protocols were applied,” said Alejandra Aguirre.State Governor Carlos Joaquín González also confirmed that Quintana Roo remains free of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus), saying that the state maintains international protocol. The governor highlighted the importance of having reliable information, noting that Quintana Roo is prepared for any contingency.He stressed that there are no flight cancellations to Quintana Roo, specifically to Cancun, adding that there is also no notice of future cancellations."
Dr. Theresa Tam has said Canadians should cancel all non-essential travel.
"I have a trip planned for later next week and will most certainly cancel. For all those saying that there are no cases in Cancun, no travel advisories, please consider the following when making your decision: 1. There are no reported cases However individuals have traveled through the airport and to the resorts from areas of community spread for weeks without any restrictions or screening. There are people from New York, California Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Germany, France who either were recently there or will be there while you are there. There has not been screening of staff who most certainly have been exposed these past few weeks. I would assume there are cases. Just as I assume there are many cases in Missouri other than the 2 that are reported. Testing has not been sufficient or widespread in US or Mexico. 2. Even if I get the virus, I’m young and healthy and I’ll be fine. That’s probably true, unless you are in the 10% who needs intensive care. In which case do you want to be in a foreign country trying to navigate their health system? Or if you don’t get really sick, do you want to bring it home to your grandmother? 3. We’re all going to get it anyway, so I might as well go. Yes, that may be true but we can decrease the rate of spread and the number sick at once so that we don’t overwhelm the healthcare system. By now everyone has heard of flatten the curve and the R0 number. If not look it up. 4. If we follow Italy’s example, things will be pretty intense In the US in 10-14 days. What if I get stuck in Mexico? Flights are closed, airports closed etc. are you ok with that? Just food for thought as you decide. I know it’s hard. I don’t want to cancel. I called Apple vacations and they said-sorry no credit towards future travel. I can try to claim with my travel insurance. But the reality is that we are all going to have take an economical hit in this."
"“Coronavirus does not survive more than 4 minutes in the heat” -- Gúbio Soares, a Brazilian virologist.Source: https:/…Text from the report...BRAZIL (Times Media Mexico) – Does climate play a role in the spread of the coronavirus? So far, it has infected 100,842 people worldwide, of whom 3,456 have died in 92 different countries.One of the top authorities in virology, Brazilian Gúbio Soares, told the newspaper Correio that “it’s probable.” According to him, COVID-19 has occurred in countries that endure low temperatures, typical of the northern winter.“COVID-19 in younger people does not cause death, it will cause a severe flu. The danger is when you have a population, like in northern Italy, that is quite old. Then these people have a greater chance of dying, because they are elderly, the immune system does not defend”. Explains Gúbio Soares.What are the conditions for the coronavirus not to reproduce?“In winter, the virus remains more in the air, it dries up, because the virus is protected by the cold. If I want to keep the virus alive, I keep the environment cold in the freezer. When I take it out and leave it in the heat, it dies, it becomes dormant. The virus doesn’t survive more than four minutes in the heat. That’s why, in the summer, the virus is weak and moderate, making it difficult for the virus to spread”. Says the virus expert.Can the civid-19 survive in the heat?“No. The coronavirus will not be able to survive in the heat because it reaches the proteins that protect the genetic material of the virus. In short, when there is heat, the virus does not survive for long periods of time”. Gúbio Soares said: “I am more afraid of dengue and zika”."

At this point people looking to cancel cannot re-book in full faith as we do not know how/when this virus will play out."
"JoanS: Thank you for your post. I will miss ‘our pizza date’ but I intend to come back to Cancun as soon as this pandemic passes. Our own Prime Minister of Canada’s wife has contacted the virus. Now he is telling all Canadians to avoid international travel to stay safe. Sunwing has offered me a refund voucher and it is good for a year. So, you and I can still have our ‘pizza date’ next year. Take care of yourself till then."
"Layne_Cat: Yeah, and not only that but the Prime Minister of Canada’s wife is under quarantine (after a speaking engagement in London, England). He is telling All Canadians (even the young and healthy) not to get on a plane for international travel, because they may be carriers who come home and give the virus to their elderly grandparents. So listen up folks (young and old) heed his advice. Most carriers are giving rain checks to people who planned for current travel - and remember this is a TEAM CANADA Effort - WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER !!!!!!!!"
I’m coming to Cancun next week March 17!
Bonnie H: Just read your post. The Canadian Government have implemented ‘A Coronavirus Alert’ that all Canadian Air Carriers must let people change their dates of travel. I am certain Expedia will help you out.
"Staying clean and as germ free as we can, of course. But its the coughing (droplets) that spread the virus, along with touching surfaces and body parts that provides the continuim. My friends and i are tripping to Riviera Maya in late April, and if there is no reported cases at my resort, off we go."
"Nzkiw7: Read your post. I am from Canada and our Prime Minister has issued a warning for all Canadians not to travel anywhere.

"Finally! Some common sense..!!Thank you, Arlene S.Edited: 4:18 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Theres so many policy changes with govt travel policy and air operators. It's so hard to keep up as this changes daily and hourly. On transat they are letting people rebook if they travel from now till april 30.. however my travel is may 31. This is such a grey area and will I be safe to cancel for may 31? Will the policy include trips in may and june? So hard to say. I'm having a really rough time with this and making decisions on the part of myself and my guests. My travel agent is so backed up helping spring breakers so i cant get any answers yet. :s
"Jeanne-you are spot on about this. Thanks for writing.""Many of us travel to poor and developing countries. Some of these countries cannot provide adequate medical care for their residents, yet I see many saying basically that they do not care what happens, they are going anyway.Ultimately, everyone has to make their own decisions, but I worry about our ""friends"" and their families as we selfishly decide to only think about ourselves."""
"I also appreciate the sentiments from Jeanne and Rissask. It’s a terrible choice, too, when you do care about people in countries whose livelihoods depend on tourism. Go and possibly put people in danger. Don’t go and put people’s jobs in danger. Ultimately, for me, health is the bedrock for a job, though I appreciate where that’s complicated by poverty and access to care."
Sage advice from both of you.
"World Traveler: Thank you. Just speak ""the truth"" and realize the WE are all in this TOGETHER - so do your par . We should be ""A COMUNITY OF COMMUNITIES"" !!!!"
"Reviewer Maryland 1: I agree with your message but ""LIFE"" should win over any JOB! I would rather lose my job if there is no ""business"" but my family would surely tell anyone and everyone that ""MY LIFE"" is more important. You can't work anywhere if you're DEAD. So yes, it bothers me that ""tourism drops"" will cause hardship to many (cruise ships etc.) but LIFE is LIFE! That is what ALL of us should recognize!"
"Ladyjayne: Well good luck to you. I hope your and your friends are at least staying at an ""adult only"" resort because anybody travelling to a ""family resort"" is looking forward to kids picking at all the food in the buffet while parents ignore the fact. I have been a ""first hand"" witness to that over the years - now I only will go to ""over 18 resorts"" and I may have to guard against all the ""drunks"" but at least I don't have to worry about kids ""touching the donuts etc. and then walking away"". And remember, any person, any age, can pick up the virus, show NO signs, and then come home and transmit the virus to mom, dad, and grandma!!!"
"Arlene, you hit the nail on the head with that one. People with little or no symptoms may put people at home and on vacation at risk. We will all return to our favorite travel destination and spend lots of money when this subsides - but now is not the time to travel."
"Cancun, here we come. Happy to leave the nervous Nellys behind and all their hysteria! We will all be fine. Besides look at what CDC published on the common flu: https:/…preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm"
"2DCJ, 31 May is a long way off. The end of April is six weeks away and still a month before your departure.Perhaps by the end of April this hysteria and the coronavirus will be winding down.Unless you have some near-term deadline that would force you to make a decision, just wait.Read the relevant policies of your booking agency, airline and/or hotel and monitor those frequently.I can't predict the course of anything related to this event but I would wait. I would also go to Cozumel via Cancun tomorrow...or next week with no concern of being infected or infecting anyone."
BC and Alberta both have confirmed cases of Covid in people that have just returned from Mexico. It's there.
"I'm sorry, but how can you believe there are only 3 cases?"
"With the travel advisory of the Canadian government not to travel abroad and travel agencies not answering support lines does anybody have information about trip cancellations?We are schedule to leave on 18 March to Mexico, but obviously all inclusive resorts does not fit what in any category of safe travel or ""social distancing""."
"To hot spots, sure. We are not cancelling. Not even close."
"""I'm sorry, but how can you believe there are only 3 cases?"" Nobody believes there's only 3 cases here in Mexico. The news has been reporting that Mexico was at 16 cases as of this am but that's likely to have gone up. So anyone paying even the slightest attention knows 3 cases is a number from about a week or so ago. I just read where the State of Quintana Roo has it's first case but don't where in the State that is. And I'd expect that number to grow as the days go by."
"Statistically it is impossible that the virus have not been spread in Mexico already. Crowds of tourists from Europe, US, UK, Canada arrive every day. How many people were tested?

Imagine watching the news about the government saying to not travel and you have to pay 1500 for a trip that you dont know is safe. At this time they risk losing $150 deposit or pay additional $1500. If I wait any longer I risk losing 100% of my wedding costs.Yes, end of May is less than 3 months away. But with the news being updated and changing quite quickly, it is too unpredictable. Canada has issued travel advisory for people to not travel to any country and will risk being quarantined for 2 weeks. I am putting my guests through stress as they do not know if they will even travel or not and if they will lose thier money. If there is no travel ban by then, my guests can potentially get stuck or quarantined or get sick, and when returning will risk being quarantined again. Some guests have dropped thier deposits and I have lost a group rate so now my guests have to pay more. Aside from this, I will have to continue to plan a wedding that may or may not happen. Some people's work medical insurance will not cover you if you knowingly travel and know the risks that you may get sick with covid, and possibly employers may not cover your sick days if you knowingly travel and will be off work to quarantine. I do not want my guests and myself to be stressed out for the next 3 months this is unfair to everyone. A wedding is suppose to be a special day and everyone should be excited, I dont want to start off my marriage with these horrible experiences. I am not worried about the covid flu itself, I am worried about the implications of it such as canada changing their advisories last minute, if mexico will change their advisories and our trip gets interrupted. Look at the United states, they took drastic measures that no one expected and now people are rushing to get home from europe. My travel agent has been working tirelessly to get her panicked clients out of europe and to help change spring breakers trips. She was on hold for 4.5 hours with westjet trying to change her clients bookings. Transat is providing flexibility to all their bookings and this is my time to make a decision. And I hope, that I make the right one that I can say I am at peace with..Now the next couple of weeks will be trying to figure out with transat what my options are and I'm going to fight to make sure that I get a refund or credit. Wish me luck"
"At 9:23pm on 3/13, Mara Lezama, president of the municipality of Cancun (Benito Juarez) announced the first confirmed case of the Coronavirus. https:/…"
viaja tranquilooo...solo toma los recaudos necesearios!!!
"2DCJ, that information was not in your first post. You have a hard decision to make. It may be you leave it up to your guests giving them all the information you have at the time."
Exact concerns that led to our family cancelling our March 14 trip - when the head health officials go on TV and recommend you cancel ALL non essential travel I believe we have a duty to comply - it's not my health but the health risk I pose to others when I return!
"Johnny E,Agree. I believe that’s our social contract."
Not anymore
Uhhh you underestimate the situation
"We cancelled our trip. Interesting observation- everyone that says they are still going are coming from New York, California, Washington State."
Wrong
"The Secretary of Health and Governor of the State of Quintana Roo have now confirmed the first positive case in Cancun. That being said, hopefully this will blow over by May. Personally, I would keep my plans but make sure I had really good travel insurance that covers cancellation, travel changes, medical expenses and medical evacuation. Cancun has one really good private hospital (and several somewhat iffy ones) but I’m not sure if they could cope well with an outbreak. https:/…3184887118240028"
Canceled out trip.
"As a recent long-time resident of Cancun, married to a Mexican and fluent in the language and culture, I can assure you that COVID-19 cases will go undetected and be under-reported in QRoo. If you decide to go, have good travel insurance and a credit card with a high limit. The virus itself may not be your problem; a country's reaction to the virus and its capacity to deal with it may be. Does anybody think that Europeans won't fly into Mexico City with eventual onward travel to the U.S.? You could be in for an extended vacay and quarantine upon return."
"Hello,We have traveled to Cancun every year and sometimes twice since 2005, after hurricanes and through other virus/illness and troubled-time warnings.We have never felt unsafe or in any danger from traveling during those times. We do have reservations for returning to Cancun on April 8th for a week and are waiting to see how the alerts and travel restrictions change at least 2 weeks before we make a final decision, hoping we get to make a decision on whether to travel.If it helps flu season South of the border is different from here in the states and will probably be a safe bet as far as exposure.You do have plenty of time to decide.Happy and Safe Travels to All!"
"Ktytex: President Trump just said today, ‘Americans should “AVOID NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL”. so there you go folks. Our Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau said the same thing on Friday (and his own wife Sophie, has contracted the disease). So a ‘word to the wise is sufficient’ don’t travel outside the U.S. right now. Every American (and all citizens of all countries) have a ‘SOCIAL CONTRACT’ with their neighbors, their families, their communities and their country. So don’t be selfish, think of others and do the ‘Right Thing’!"
Canadian citizens are now being urged to return home: https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/return-home…
"CanDoCan: I’ll bet you have NEVER travelled after the President of the United Staes has declared an ‘State of Emergency‘, and President Trump did just that today. I am from Canada, and when my Prime Minister came out yesterday, advising the cancellation of all International Travel, I heeded his advice. I am heart broken to have to cancel my 2 weeks In Paradise at the Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya, as I suffer from (SAD) - Seasonal Affective Disorder’ and I travel ‘every winter’ for mental health reasons, but I decided to do the right thing and ‘stay home’ - Playa del Carmen will still be there next March. I URGE all Americans/Canadians to listen to the CDC and the WHO. Life is precious, and no vacation is worth the cost of endangering your family, your neighbors, your community and your citizens."
"Well said, Arlene."
“If it helps flu season South of the border is different from here in the states and will probably be a safe bet as far as exposure.”It’s not the flu. We are talking about a new virus and it is yet unknown how it will behave on the longer term except that it keeps spreading (114 countries today). In the meantime be responsible and heed the advice of avoiding unnecessary travel.
"Zeni Z: Good for you - you did the right thing! I cancelled yesterday, and I’m so depressed about it, I can’t even put it into words. But when my Prime Minister asks me to do the right thing and cancel any ‘International Travel’, I heeded his advice. So good on you. Playa del Carmen will still be there next year!!Edited: 3:58 pm, March 14, 2020 "
kollision: You are ‘Right On’ - thank you for stating the obvious. Hope others listen to your wise advice!
How are things in Cancun ? I am planning on going the 20-25.
"People here are concerned. You can see it more now since one case was confirmed here than you could yesterday for example. But people aren't panicked right now. I noticed people stocking up on things like toilet paper and non-perishable foods. It's pretty much impossible to find antibacterial gel and today the stock of the wipes and sprays wasn't near as full as yesterday. I'm sure things are pretty much business as normal in the hotel zone. But that's a bubble. I'd be willing to bet many there don't know about the confirmed case. One thing I did different and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future is not to take any buses or combis. They pack people in like sardines and I prefer not to be part of that. Unfortunately, that's how the majority of workers get to the hotel zone and back home daily. So hopefully they're washing their hands after a buscombi trip and not shaking guests hands. As more cases pop up here (and they will) the situation will likely change."
"I have been in contact with the wedding resort coordinator and they stated due to no government travel or medical advisories in mexico, they are not being flexible on my wedding as I asked to reschedule for 2021. I think they need to look at this global health advisory and WHO has stated the same warning.. I am hoping that mexico realizes they need to start acting on this and be proactive before it does get out of hand."
"""I am hoping that mexico realizes they need to start acting on this and be proactive before it does get out of hand.""I hope so too."
Mexico has suspended school for one month. They are extending the Semana Santa school break. Last day of classes will be March 20 with a return on April 20. https:/…

I'm brazilian. This is fake information.
We have a group going down April 26. I have advised everyone not to make decisions about it until the last-possible day.
We leave March 26th unless we are forced not to go. Forced by airline cancellation.
"“Coronavirus cannot survive in heat” is complete BS. Respected epidemiologist Michael Osterholm debunks this in his interview on the “Joe Rogan Experience.” Both SARS and MERS, which are also coronaviruses, survived in very hot weather. https://youtu.be/E3URhJx0NSw"
"HELLO Any updates on procedures arrival and departure at the Cancun airport. My trip is planned and upcoming very soonThank youEdited: 7:29 am, March 15, 2020 "
"“ HELLOAny updates on procedures arrival and departure at the Cancun airport. My trip is planned and upcoming very soonThank you”Who knows because things are changing daily, hourly. Reports thus far are that CUN is doing little (yikes) but that US airports are now seeing “massive delays” upon return. Canadians are being advised to return while they still can."
"As a recent long-time resident of Cancun, married to a Mexican and fluent in the language and culture, I can assure you that COVID-19 cases will go undetected and/or under-reported in QRoo. If you decide to go, I suggest having good travel insurance and a credit card with a high limit. Be prepared! The virus itself may not be your problem; you most likely won't be infected... but a country's reaction to the virus and its capacity to deal with it may be your greater problem. You could be in for an extended vacay and quarantine upon return should flights be cancelled or borders closed temporarily. The virus has not peaked in Mexico."
@suzanne I came in last Wednesday arrival was like normal. I’m dreading the line at customs when we return home though. We’re one of 13 airports allowing European flights to come in.
"I too have a family trip in late April to Cancun. I’m reading more than likely the majority of the US will catch the virus. Experts say it can go on as long as a year and a half. We all can’t continue to be locked in our homes. Schools, colleges, grocery shopping must go on in order for the Economy to survive. I understand at this time we all should take precaution and though we’re taking it one day at a time rather if we should cancel or not. The key is washing your hands and if you are in the airport stay 6 feet away from others and in the plane keep your face mask on if you like and wipe down any metal hard surfaces. Like seatbelts, table, arm rest, the buttons above you for lighting and the window area. Hope this helps for anyone traveling."
"We just returned from a 6 night stay at the Hard Rock Riviera Maya last night. I suppose I'm glad we went as we had a good time, but I did feel quite a bit of stress while we were there which certainly impacted the trip. I was mostly worried about getting stuck there amid a health care emergency, which I do believe is likely coming. I felt very relieved to get home."
We are to be there on Friday. Aren't you worried they wont allow you in?
I was reading what our airline is doing and the different advisories around the world. Most of it is for incoming travel. Several countries are allowing their citizens to still come in/come home (you may have a 14 day quarantine though). I feel like many people read travel restrictions and fear of being stuck. Yes government has said non-essential travel but if you do leave/have left you’ll be able to come back.
The people coming back from Europe seem to be subject to long waits to be screened at select airports. TV footage showed hundreds or more people packed together.Great times.No mention of mandatory quarantine.I still see no issue with travel to Cancun at this time. If they suddenly reported a thousand cases in Q.Roo then that might change.
"Thank you for the information, we hated to, but just cancelled our trip to cancun. We were supposed to leave next week."
Thank you. It's too hot here for the virus to survive.
"Before Isha gets roasted there is a sweet spot according to Chinese studies. https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/arti…Also,the experts i.e. medical field still don't know how it spreads.Different article https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/arti…And don't believe the Chinese simply look at the map. Why does India have so few cases? Bangkok? Egypt? etc. From the evidence provided so far one can postulate that the novel virus can infect anybody anywhere, but perhaps it does like cooler climates. There are a lot of unknowns and my gut feeling is that nearly everybody is going to contract the virus, and many of us will never know. Each one of us needs to be aware of who we come in contact with, and grandma and grandpa in realty should just be skyped or FaceTimed.Edited: 2:21 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"336. Claudia M: You wrote:”if you are in the airport stay 6 feet away from others” - that’s hilarious - most Airport Arrivals/departures, Customs/Immigration LINES are WALL TO WALL with ‘inches’ to spare. Have you not be watching the news the last few days. The US Airports are ‘wall to wall’ standing only inches apart from others - so good luck finding 6 feet from others. Trump’s lead man on his Coronavirus Team is on all the US Sunday morning talk shows saying “IT’S POSSIBLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS COULD DIE” - So Americans better wake up to the realities of what is actually happening."
GrantK: Smart move. Fox News just reported that Trump is considering a “National Lockdown“ (like what Europe has implemented) so Americans had better get used to ‘a new way of life’ in the next few months.
"I’ve been on hold with Secrets Resorts for over 3 hours trying to cancel our trip. We were supposed to leave Thursday for Riviera Maya. Very disappointed, but figure it’s for the best. Besides the concern of getting sick while there or infecting others (if already incubating the virus) and possible future travel restrictions, I’d be too anxious to really enjoy myself. Hopefully we’ll get to go next year instead!Thanks for all the info and opinions on Tripadvisor, it did help me weigh the issues and come to a decision that feels right for us.Wishing everyone continued good health and safe travels!"
"GranK: Justin Trudeau, our Prime Minister (whose own wife has the virus after a speaking engagement in London) spoke at length to POTUS yesterday, and it appears Trump is considering a close of all US borders until the end of April (a National Lockdown), so if Americans want to travel ‘internationally’ to places like Cancun, they should be prepared to be quarantined when they come back into the United States!"
"Martdg: Listen dear, you and I are singing from the same hymn book. I had a 2 week trip planned for the Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya on March 30th and it broke my heart to cancel. I literally spent 6 hours (I swear) with Sunwing Vacations, Toronto to cancel my trip. I had full refund and travel insurance (but because my travel was only a few weeks away I had to settle for a $7000 voucher, which is fine with me) but I could not believe I was ‘on hold for 6 hours’. I thought I’d have a nervous breakdown waiting. That illustrates to me, how many Canadians were trying to cancel at one time.So, I have my travel voucher and it’s good for one year. So, Playa del Carmen will still be there for me next year. Americans are still in ‘denial’ with what is happening, and when they return from ‘their holiday in the sun’, they are going to be in for a ‘rude awakening’ unfortunately’! Americans should listen to their President and NOT travel unless it is an emergency (like a death in the family) - a word to the wise is sufficient my mother always said!!!Edited: 3:56 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"JohnP: I agree with you about ‘grandma and grandpa’. Please let us ALL just SKYPE all our older loves ones. Let us all ‘Flatten the Curve’ as they say and if that means staying indoors, avoiding all events, bars, your gym, restaurants, etc., then so be it! WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER!!!! Have you seen today, the ‘standing room only’ at US Airports, it is heartbreaking. FOX News is misleading people when they say ‘everything is under control’ - I firmly believe that when the History Books are written, this US response will be Trump’s Chernobyl!."
Trip is still on for a friend next week. They are flying in private with no worries.
"I just cancelled my trip scheduled for tomorrow. The kicker is that I can’t guarantee getting home on March 23. I also would have to self-isolate if I get home. And the fact that prime minister Trudeau has not ruled closing the border? Where would I live on March 23rd? And how/when would I get home? At what cost? The “great deal” I got on my trip would dissipate as I spend an excessive amount of money on accommodations and flights if/when Canada lets me home if they close border. And the fact that I bought no cancellation insurance and Sunwing is allowing cancellations should tell you something. I lose $100/person. And get a voucher for remaining. I’m dreaming about a two week vacay in 2021 to make up for it. Would not be a relaxing trip. Those of you still going, are dillusional. Life is changing hour by hour. What happens while you’re away is really far away and evolving, too risky. Do your part everyone, stay home."
"Grant K: Well you are one of the lucky ones. Imagine this, you are on a ‘Cruise Ship’ right now, and NO ONE will let you come into port. Cruise Ships are ‘ A Petri Dish’ for this disease. Why would ANYONE want to be on a Cruise Ship? You would have to be nuts!Edited: 4:35 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Cyndi: Bless you. I am telling you ‘the worst is yet to come’ so as a Canadian, I am proud ‘you did the right thing’. And you showed your ‘social responsibility’ as we are all in this CRISIS together."
"Have reservations for May 16-23.Would like to cancel because we are both in our 70's and I have a medical precondition not covered by insurance.Jet Blue only giving change/cancellation waivers for trips through April 30 right now. Cost of trip would go into a travel bank to be used within a year. I can live with that, but hope they extend the cancellation date beyond Apr. 30 soon so I can finally decide."
"Arelen S keep politics out of this please! Trump has not been perfect I'll agree, but many doctors have stated even on your channel fake news CNN the system was bad before Trump took office and the system was not in place to have an outbreak of this magnitude! So to all of those bashing Trump remember the health system was NOT in place long before Trump took office. Am I saying Trump hasn't made some mistakes no he definitely has but stop blaming Trump when him and all the doctors put together the testing system now in place in record time. They said within a month we will have over 5 million test kits available that is an amazing accomplishment by everyone involved! We all need to stick together and not play the blame game. Just a few words of wisdom.Edited: 4:58 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Thanks Arlene S, it was a hard call to make! I finally got through with Secrets Resorts and our trip is officially cancelled. I was able to cancel with just a $50 fee and the remainder fully refunded, since we were still 4 days out from arrival. I could’ve rescheduled instead with no fee, but I’d rather pay upfront and have more flexibility with when we can reschedule."
"There is nothing political about the incompetence of Trump. He announced a travel ban from Europe but failed to mention that US citizens and residents could could arrive later, creating a panic that caused crowding in airports. Exactly what medical experts don’t want. That’s just the latest example. He’s been a fraud and a crook his entire life. But sure, keep telling us to put “politics” aside and accept incompetence when our parents medical fragile loved ones are at risk..."
This is not Trump's fault in any way.
He fired the white house pandemic team. I suppose that wasn't his fault either...

"He didn't fire them, somebody else did it! Just ask him! (BTW, why keep a Pandemic Team on the payroll when there is often no pandemic?) Americans are all about government efficiency, don't you know! And, for his next act, Trump will fire the CDC. They are also worthless and thus a waste of our hard earned tax money.

"This posting makes great sense, even if it is posted by Arlene from Toronto who is obviously still upset by the recent decision by Cancun to ban all Toronto residents! But the need to get better informed is an important point and it needs to be applied to all! There is a lot of trash tossed onto this Board. Readers beware! If you have doubts about traveling to Cancun, you must contact Cancun for up to date advice. Has anybody called Cancun recently? re- You said ‘If it helps Flu Season south of the border is different from here in the States and will probably be a safe bet as far as exposure’. Are you kidding me? Look at countries like Singapore and Iran? They are in ‘hot climates’ and they both have high rates of infection, so if you think that going to Mexico means you have some ‘protection’ you are dreaming in Technicolor. You need to be better informed."
I do not care what any Canadian says about my Country or my President. My Cancun trip for mid April is on unless either the U.S or Mexican Government shuts me down.
"Did you experience any ""problems"" or long long lines getting through immigration while there? I really don't want to cancel our trip... ): I feel that if we take precautions it should be fine."

"This is a very well prepared posting by purvips74 of Saint Louis with a lot to think about. Especially regarding the Travel Insurance. I have experienced a similar decline when I investigated the whether or not I could recoup my down payments without major penalties. Delta may help me if they shut down travel across the board. Thank you, purvips! This is a VIP (very important post!). re- I have a trip planned for later next week and will most certainly cancel. For all those saying that there are no cases in Cancun, no travel advisories, please consider the following when making your decision:1. There are no reported cases However individuals have traveled through the airport and to the resorts from areas of community spread for weeks without any restrictions or screening. There are people from New York, California Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Germany, France who either were recently there or will be there while you are there. There has not been screening of staff who most certainly have been exposed these past few weeks. I would assume there are cases. Just as I assume there are many cases in Missouri other than the 2 that are reported. Testing has not been sufficient or widespread in US or Mexico.2. Even if I get the virus, I’m young and healthy and I’ll be fine. That’s probably true, unless you are in the 10% who needs intensive care. In which case do you want to be in a foreign country trying to navigate their health system? Or if you don’t get really sick, do you want to bring it home to your grandmother?3. We’re all going to get it anyway, so I might as well go. Yes, that may be true but we can decrease the rate of spread and the number sick at once so that we don’t overwhelm the healthcare system. By now everyone has heard of flatten the curve and the R0 number. If not look it up.4. If we follow Italy’s example, things will be pretty intense In the US in 10-14 days. What if I get stuck in Mexico? Flights are closed, airports closed etc. are you ok with that?Just food for thought as you decide. I know it’s hard. I don’t want to cancel. I called Apple vacations and they said-sorry no credit towards future travel. I can try to claim with my travel insurance. But the reality is that we are all going to have take an economical hit in this."
""" the recent decision by Cancun to ban all Toronto residents! ""What is your source for this statement?Please post a link."
"I have a trip planned to Cancun for a week in mid April, I'm not canceling my plans. I may have to be tested at the border, which will be fine. I'm probably more likely to get COVID here in N. CA. I wouldn't travel if I didn't have a good immune system."
I’m not sure what it will take for some people to grasp that the decision to move about in their lives right now should be based on more than the strength of their own immune systems. I guess that’s why mandatory lockdowns become necessary.
"This past weekend multiple countries in Latin America have decided to take the unprecedented step to completely deny entry to all non resident foreigners. (Colombia, Peru, Argentina, El Salvador, Panama.) And in the Caribbean, even Aruba and Sint Maarten, islands that are totally dependent on tourism, are completely banning foreign arrivals!. I'm not sure how much longer Mexico can sustain doing absolutely nothing except take people's temperature at the airport.. Mexico also had it's first death yesterday from Wuhan Aids. A 71 year old who contracted it when in the USA. My point is things are changing rapidly and drastically and by the time your vacation comes around you may not have the choice whether to stay or go. I'm going in a month and have not canceled (only because I am renting a house and not staying in a big hotel) but there may be a ban by the time I go. A good resource for latest government regulations by country. which is being updated daily. https:/…"
yeah and the check is in the mail you believe that one too?
Arlene - I wrote that there was still enough time for NanSea123 to make a decision on whether or not to travel. As you are quoting the President maybe you should heed his recent suggestion to CALM DOWN.
who cares ?
ME too!
"mauiman97: As my mother used to say ‘If ignorance is BLISS you must by very HAPPY!! I also happen to notice that you are not a regular contributor to these Forums, and so are a lot of posters who share NO contribution to the ‘ Cancun Trip Advisor Forum’ and you know what it tells us, it tells us you just want to ‘GO TO CANCUN AT ANY COST AND TO HELL WITH ANYONE BUT ME’ attitude, and yet, you have never contributed ANYTHING to this Cancun Forum before. So shame on you and all your ‘I have something to say’ posters. You are fooling none of us who have been on this thread for years. Have a good vacation! Hope you don’t pass on the ‘virus’ to your loved ones!!"
Well the decision to not go was just made for me. Travelling from Canada and Sunwing just cancelled all flights south for my travel time. Full refund!
"No you misinterpret my post. I meant to highlight the number of deaths for the flu in the Untied states being approximately 50K according to the CDC in the last 5 months. How does that stack up against the deaths related to covid19? Our travel plans are still green lit unless Mexican or US authorities require to deviate from the plan.Edited: 5:21 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Yup you get trolls on ALL boards...
"Patricia A: Yeah, I know. But why would they want to expose themselves, when we ALL know they are FAKE - they just embarrass themselves. If you click, you see they have JUST RECENTLY joined - TOO FUNNY EH!"
And some are oblivious to the situation.....
"Jeanne W: Yeah agree. It is a sad commentary to see so many Trolls on this site and all of them interested in only one thing. It’s all about ME, ME, ME. No social responsibility, no carrying about who you may infect after your ‘beach holiday’ - How pathetic is that!"

"I don't understand why some people are ignoring medical and infectious disease experts and leaders of countries who are saying don't travel, come home, etc. We are only at the beginning of this in North America. Our experts are looking at Italy and what happened there and saying we need to keep our hospitals from getting overwhelmed by sick people all at once so limit your exposure and maybe we will be able to cope.Thank you to those who have heeded that advice and are helping to flatten the curve"

The Mexican president is playing it off and encouraged people to hug and kiss still. He was even seen hugging people over the weekend. He is downplaying everything and let the womens soccer event go on as well.
If they Allow we will have a wedding mid-April.
"""The Mexican president is playing it off and encouraged people to hug and kiss still. He was even seen hugging people over the weekend. He is downplaying everything and let the womens soccer event go on as well.""I saw that earlier today. Totally boggles my mind. I am not a fan."
"I think that they have to downplay it because the tourist industry brings in a lot of money. If people stopped going, it would affect Mexico severely."
"For those who have been recently, were most of the restaurants and businesses operating as usual? Does it seem like the numbers we're seeing of confirmed cases may be under reported or does everyone there truly seem to be unaffected? Anyone else who is there now have any input?Edited: 2:09 am, March 17, 2020 "
Pretty soon all flights will be grounded and will effectively shutdown businesses. IF they know what is good for them. My trip was cancelled yesterday--they cancelled flights. As far as I know so far two airlines are not flying south! I was to leave on Mar 22. We in Canada are trying to flatten the curve and this morning more stringent measures are being take. It is NOT media but rather our Government who is presenting the facts and rules to save our population. I wish the Mexican people all the best in this difficult time.
The President (US) was just asked 3 minutes ago if people should still travel to Mexico or the Carribbean. He said people should stay home.And this is from the man who didn't take it seriously at first. He now realizes this is more than seriousl
"I’m begging you all as an RN who is experiencing this firsthand in a large hospital near Chicago. Our ER staff cannot help the number of people who are showing up hourly. These are people of all age ranges and those who have traveled from all areas including Mexico. Don’t add to the burden. Think about this...if I do get sick in Mexico you are goi g to strain their healthcare system quickly putting Mexican citizens at risk. Economies can be rebuilt, lives taken cannot."

I don't want to get political but he is a chronic and habitual liar. He is now realizing if he had taken action sooner more lives would have been saved! USA has 5204 cases and 92 deaths and climbing. So those carriers of the virus from USA still thinking of travelling south is how it is spread...STAY HOME!
"I am not even American...lol! I am Canadian close to the border. I have many American friends and we ALL feel the same. The stats speak for themselves. This is how it is spread. We were just told by our Prime Minister this morning, just after he spoke yesterday that more stringent measures are being enacted. Our border is closed."
"I'm not a fan of Trump but Trudeau was slow to react as well given the information that was available to him. However, at least we don't have to deal with the Mexican president. His level of ignorance and denial is astounding and scary. Our border is only partially closed. It is still open to Americans."
Yes for now but the full border closure could come into effect as things evolve...And I just check USA now has 5702 cases! The numbers are morphing as we speak...Cananda has 449.Stay safe out there...

"“The chance that anyone from the USA going to Cancun is infected with COVID-19 is remote.”Beyond_YXU, your assessment is spot on! Where I live, everyone now knows someone with the virus, and many could easily have been exposed at this point. Any place in the US big enough for a major airport will be there in a week or two. Air traffic control at Midway was shut down because of exposure yesterday. A Delta flight was grounded out of JFK. A WestJet flight has exposure. State governments are issuing shelter-in-place orders as a public health precaution because of the virulence. So many more have it than are able to be tested and the numbers are growing exponentially. Continuing to dismiss this is delusional.Edited: 5:30 am, March 18, 2020 "
There are now confirmed cases of Covid 19 on a flight from Cancun to Calgary Alberta...stay home. Mexico does have many unreported cases.
Co pilot 54 you need to understand that this cannot be compared to ‘normal flu’Covid 19 is a completely new virus that no one has immunity to. Spare a thought for health care workers who will have to deal with the rush of patients who all get sick at once.

Just saw that the US is shutting all consulates in Mexico. Published in Yucatán Expat Life
"Different question - we are in Puerto Morales now, ticket to fly home in US on March 21. Opportunity to stay in PM an additional two weeks. Been here for two weeks already. Continue self-quarantine in Mexico or risk traveling back to US? Seniors in age."
I would get back home asap especially with seniors who might need healthcare.This thing is only getting started and we in the U.S. are following Italy trajectory not Wuhan's.Hoping to see drop in daily new infections or deaths in Italy to have some hope otherwise we are talking months not weeks.We are honckered down in Buffalo NY and they just closed our border with Canada.
"""Just saw that the US is shutting all consulates in Mexico.""True. But they are still providing emergency services if needed:U.S. citizens in need of 24/7 emergency assistance should call 81-4160-5512 (from Mexico) or +1 (844) 528-6611 (from the United States)."
I am supposed to leave this Saturday the 21st of March....is anyone there...are the beaches open?
"I live here. Yes, the beaches are open. Yes, there are people here. But that really shouldn't be the deciding factor as to if you come should it? Don't you think it's more important to listen to your country's health officials and government warning on non-essential travel?Cancun will still be here in when this is over. The beaches will still be open and more people will be here."
"....Continue self-quarantine in Mexico or risk traveling back to US?... If you suspect you are infected and in quarantine in beautiful Puerto Morelos, it's too late to come back. Otherwise if healthy...come home. The sooner, the better. If 65 or over and an American, you'll at least have medicare should you get sick. Good luck."
"CO Pilot, you stand alone at this point trying to make people believe that this is anything like seasonal flu. You have a right to your opinion, but facts matter. Even Fox News is now taking this seriously. Have you seen the death tolls rising in Italy? Do you understand mortality rates for these vastly different viruses? A tenth of a percent for seasonal flu, versus what will likely end up at 1 percent for COVID 19. Telling people that this is the same as any other year, is doing a disservice to the immunosuppressed and the elderly who will suffer the most from this. Even the backward country of Mexico is closing schools throughout the country. Cancun bars, restaurants, etc. are closing Sunday. I don't understand your thought process."
"""Telling people that this is the same as any other year, is doing a disservice to the immunosuppressed and the elderly who will suffer the most from this. ""Philip, you and many others here cannot see reality and apparently go by ""feelings"" attacking my position.Read them. Summary: At risk folks in nursing homes/ hospitals need to be protected from any disease that threatens them. That is not just the Wuhan virus but also colds, flu, etc.Others at high risk on their own need to assume the primary responsibility for their safety.Of course everyone needs to take prudent measures to prevent becoming sick and if they do get sick, stay away from others."
"CoPilot, why are you posting just to make light of the situation? So you can use the racist dogwhistle Wuhan virus? It's Covid19 or Corona Virus. Your posts are not helpful."
"Agree CoPilot, your posts are not only not helpful, they are harmful."
Blossom...wish there was a like button! His posts are just silly and should be ignored.
"Here is some information from the CDC, as reported in The New York Times, for those who still believe this is less serious than the annual flu (which has a vaccine by the way and this does not). Now this is a projection for the US solely and if measures are not taken to try to control the spread.""Between 160 million and 214 million people in the United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to a projection that encompasses the range of the four scenarios. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die.And, the calculations based on the C.D.C.’s scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the United States could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill.""To extrapolate that, projections have been made in Canada that up to 70% of a country's population could become infected by this virus. And to toss aside statements like it will kill the elderly as if that was not bad enough, totally ignores the others like people with diabetes, asthma, cystic fibrosis, the immunosuppressed such as transplant recipients and cancer patients.All of these closures, flight cancellations and the recommendation to socially distance and self isolate are measures experts (who know what they are talking about) have put into place to try to prevent a peak infection rate like what happened in Italy, Spain, China, etc. Everyone must work together and follow the recommendations to make this work.Making light of this or ignoring their advice is not only unhelpful, it is dangerous. By the way, they now have fines in place in Spain to keep people in their houses."
"thank you , Philip. My husband and I were first suppose to go to where we always do, french polynesia atoll of Rangiroa, for our anniversary march 24. That became problematic with the Europe travel ban and virus spread. We also own a home in Cozumel, where we plan to move full time, in July. We live in Castle Rock, CO, and are very very familiar with the Springs. The bad information will not end. Thank you for trying. CO pilot will never ever admit he is wrong. But he is, and CO will stand up and say he is, if we survive. My husband is high risk, and I thank all the people here and everywhere else, making the right choices, to NOT expose others or themselves. T1 diabetes diagnosis as an adult is an abrupt change. We change everything. And to hear people so cavalierly shout how anyone should just go, damn the consequences, over the last few days I've been reading, honestly is amazing...but in a bad way. MOST posters have cared and had empathy and displayed concern for the world we all live in. CO pilot? Embodies WHY we are selling and leaving this particular part of CO. Although we OWN a home there,a nd could still have gotten there and celebrated our anniversary, we are not going to put ANY other person at risk. We will wait. We will also be paying our property manager more in the meantime, given this horrible disruption to the economies here. I hope we get to live this part of our lives once this has played out. In the meantime, we work from home, we have skype with our kids/grands, and we limit as much as possible ANY times out of our homes to necessities. MOST people I have seen are kind, caring, unselfish and empathetic. COPilot??? This is why I don't spend any time in the Springs. EVER. Sorry but...I'm on forums with french polynesia also, and I haven't seen ANYONE make such selfish posts as I've seen here. If that gets me banned? so be it. We have near family there (who we stay with every year for the past 10 years, who consider us family and who we consider family and the forums there are SO vastly different from here, no trolls or awful people saying just go and expose the entire island to a deadly virus) and I've observed NO selfishness and people losing a lot more money too in some case. Have some humanity. COPilot isn't capable of that. We all know why, or at least I do, being I live in the same county and know EXACTLY why he says what he does. It puts lives at stake. Please Stay Home And please...we are all in this together, let's act like it. CO Pilot never will. I have written people off in my own family who share his issues. I will continue to do the same. virus is growing in the US, I expect it will in Mexico, and I truly hope we can all come together and build things back once this is passed. Be safe all."
What´s the situation today in Cancun ? My trip is in may ?Shoud I give up ?
"First COVID-19 related death in Mexico, positive cases increaseSource:https://www.riviera-maya-news.com/first-covid-19-related-death-in-mexico-positive-cases-increase/2020.html By Riviera Maya News on March 19, 2020Mexico City, Mexico — The Secretary of Health has reported the first death of a person in Mexico with COVID-19. The agency said the 41-year-old victim had diabetes and showed symptoms of coronavirus since March 9.Arturo Herrera, head of the agency explained the victim was a 41-year-old man who was infected with coronavirus at a concert he attended with his wife in Mexico City March 3 and that he he had no history of having traveled abroad. He died in a Mexico City hospital.“ Today in Mexico the first person died with #COVID19. His symptoms started on March 9. He suffered from diabetes. The Secretary of Health expresses their condolences to his relatives. Rest in peace ,” wrote SSalud on social media.Alejandra Aguirre, Health Secretary of Quintana Roo, announced that there are now six positive cases of COVID-19 in the state. The official stressed that the six cases are in the northern area of Quintana Roo.“As of March 18, 2020, we have 62 suspected cases of which 39 are negative, 17 are under study and we have six positives,” she said. She added that they are monitoring people who had contact with the six infected. She asked the public to remain well informed and to carry out all the prevention protocols.There are currently 118 cases of COVID-19 in Mexico. The general director of Epidemiology, José Luis Alomía reported that 314 are suspects and 787 have been ruled out. Of that total, 51 percent are men and 49 percent are women."
"We have decided to not travel to Rivera Maya, MX at this time. Called our company, Vacation Express and got a full refund for all of us and we didn't have travel insurances. At first they were going to give out voucher which is good to travel until 12/31/2021 but the cancellation policy change day by day. So, we got a full refund!! I am not afraid of catching the virus but because we want to be responsible citizens, stop the spreading by staying home. Also, its not worth to go if you would have to think about all of the uncertainty. It won't be a relaxing vacation for me. Stay safe & well everyone!!!"
"Cancun mayor orders all bars, theaters, casinos closedSource: https:/…2020.htmlBY RIVIERA MAYA NEWS ON MARCH 19, 2020Cancun, Q.R. — Cancun’s mayor María Lezama Espinosa announced that her administration has ordered the closing of cinemas, bars, discos and casinos effective immediately, as part of the measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.The move was made with officials saying the advance of the pandemic requires taking stricter measures, understanding that people’s health and life take precedence over economic value.Lezama Espinosa announced that supermarkets, pharmacies and hospitals will be asked to establish meter-and-a-half distances between their clients. She says city hall meetings will be held behind closed doors and will broadcast news on both the Internet and by radio.She added that as of Thursday, in-person tax payments will be suspended without any consequence to the tax payer, noting that it is vital to prevent the spread of the virus, for which it is necessary to respect the provisions of the federal, state and municipal governments.“We cannot allow the virus to spread, we must put up barriers, which is why we are working with all sectors, hoteliers, restaurateurs, shopping malls, street vendors. We have to act based on a strategy and in an orderly manner,” she explained.“Everyone agrees we need to take whatever actions need to be taken. You have to establish social isolation and there are businesses that will have to close,” she added. “It is not about creating panic, but it is a global pandemic…and we are living it. The most important thing is health, hence preventive measures must be applied.”In light of the announcement by Cancun’s mayor, the Ministry of Health clarified that a letter circulating across social media claiming the restrictions apply to the state is completely false.The agency says that the letter, which is allegedly from Cofepris announcing the closure of bars, nightclubs and casinos throughout the state, is apocryphal. The fake news has been spread across WhatsApp and Facebook.As of today, these new restrictions apply only to the municipality of Benito Juárez."
We are trying to rebook and they are difficult saying there are No travel advisories...just nointernational flights
"blossom: I just got a text from my daughter who has friends in Calgary, Alberta. She said a West Jet flight from Cancun to Calgary on March 12 (Flight 2311 Rows 32-38) were exposed to the virus. So it is obvious no traveler going through the Cancun airport is safe from contacting the disease. With what’s going on in the US and Canada, it appears ‘community spread’ is real and happening in real time. Bunker down everyone!"
this is correct. I am a travel agent. all clients traveling now through June I am advising to cancel and rebook for a future date

Yet many people were posting political views. Anything I said about Co-pilot‘s posts were deleted within the hour. I guess he may have influence at TA because he is a Destination Expert. I’m sure this post will be removed too! So good for you for ‘speaking truth to power’. Co-pilot, well don’t know what his agenda is, or why he is in such denial about ‘community transmission’. He talks as if this is a ‘flu’ it is not it is a deadly virus that kills. As I have been posting since Day 1, we really are ‘All In This Together’!!!"
"blossom: 439: Loved your post - good for you for calling it what it is a ‘racist dogwhistle’ - I’m shocked Co-Pilot hasn’t had it removed. I have said much less a political statement or comment, and my posts are all removed. Some people have friends in high places I guess and someone has me flagged. But YOU took the words right out of my mouth, so bless you!"
Jodi- wish the airlines could make it simple for people are are trying to do their due diligence and stay home. Airlines are only looking into march and april bookings. And refuse to look at may or june bookings. Currently my contract still stands and I risk losing money because the airlines dont care.
