"Dear all,Have you planned a visit to Kiev, which has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic? Do you still consider to go there after this crisis?With kind regards,Jelle"
We had planned to go to Ukraine and land in Kyiv around April 13 but of course all cancelled. We will be guided by all Governments as to when it will be safe to visit. Yes we will visit as we will any country after the crisis is over.
I had a trip planned this month and rescheduled it to late August.. Plan to visit churches and Chernobyl among other things..I hope I will able to travel.. If not I will postpone to autumn 2020 or spring 2021 hopefully...
"For socially responsible people ""after this crisis"" (which is far from being over so far) equals to after the novel coronavirus vaccine is invented and administered to the population of your country of departure and your destination country. The vaccine is tentatively expected not until 2021. Personally I don't plan to travel for leisure (=non essential travel) anywhere until the population is vaccinated because I have no goal to inadvertently murder anyone. Even if you don't worry for yourself and your family, think about the elderly parents or grandparents of a hotel receptionist or a taxi driver to whose untimely demise you could contribute. Is that your reason to travel? Not mine."
Yes
747 deaths from Covid-19 in Ukraine. Compare to 13000+ from the Donbas conflict.
How are things in Ukraine? We want to visit in July... I think by then things should be looking pretty much normal? Borders with Belarus and Moldova are open? Do we need to test prior to arrival?
Moldavian border still closed. No flights into UA yet. Self-assessment and 14 day quarantine required in Belarus. July 1st trips are unlikely.
"#6, no PCR testing upon arrival announced so far, all arrivals have to self-isolate for 14 days, either with an app and at your specified self-isolation address or at a state-designated isolation facility (a big unknown what and where those are). A fine for not complying is 17,000 uah (about 560 euro).All Ukrainian borders have been always open for Ukrainian residents both for entry and exit, with fewer checking points, only by car or recently they relaunched at least one pedestrian crossing with Poland. Ukrainian borders have been temporarily closed for non-residents (with universal exceptions, n/a for tourists) till 22 June. I guess Ukraine will open its borders for foreign nationals from the EU when the latter opens its borders to Ukraine. Israel very realistically said no to resuming flights to Ukraine with its current infection rate.Ukraine, with its very moderate testing, is currently reporting more daily infection cases (400-550) than, say, Germany. Most of Western Ukraine and Kyiv are the most affected and aren't recommended currently to move to the same level of lockdown easing as the rest of the country."
I was in Kyiv in Spring 2019 and had a great time. Was considering going back mainly to enjoy the night life and clubs before I am too old. What is the story with such things are things getting back to normal. I i go it will be in September will stuff be back open by then. I obviously wont go if things are closed or there is a quarantine required
"Currently even indoor restaurants aren't allowed to have eaters inside. Nobody knows what will be in a week, much less about September. A 14-days quarantine, as of today, is announced not to be applicable to those traveling from and having spent last two weeks in a country with the epidemiological numbers which are better or equal to those of Ukraine."
"Great news! Ukraine is on my itinerary for July, want to come there from Belarus. If it is not possible from Belarus, then I would come from Poland..."
"Well, it was a simplified explanation. I wonder if the mechanism which reportedly is being developed by the MOH would be implementable in practice/won't be changed in the near future. A red list of countries with a mandatory quarantine upon arrival is to include those which have a reported incidence of over 40 cases per 100,000 population per certain-period-of-time (three days?). The list is to be reviewed every three days or so by the MOH."
II thought I read somewhere that clubs bars and restaurants are open or will be opened soon and am aware of the quarantine as well. I am planning on going away in September Moldova was my first choice before covid but dont know Romania is also been looked at but I will have to see how things go I may need to stay closer to home
"predrog,Belarussian citizen can go to Ukraine by plane or bus?"
"#13, as of today, according to mayor of Kyiv, bars, night clubs, etc aren't allowed to function in Kyiv. Those which flout this regulation are fined: https://nv.ua/ukr/kyiv/karantin-u-kiyevi-ne-…"

Yes I’m booked too fly out on the 17th July
Yes i wish to travel to kyiv and Odessa.
Shiv R so what is your question?
"I am travelling to kiev in a party of 8, 9th july - 13th, is it open ?? bars,restaurants, places to go ??"
You won't be able to go to those places if you're in quarantine whether they're open or not.
you do not have to be in quarantine if you do covid test
"Just so you know AK, you are meant to wear that Over your nose!!"
"I was thinking about visiting 20th of August for a week? Provided I get tested for Covid-19, will there be bars and restaurants open?"
"Hi, so how is your trip?"

"Hi,I normally go to Kiev once a month at least, I like the place. The way things are looking I will be surprised if it will be ever again this year. Lots of things to consider at the moment, holiday insurance for a big start, god forbid if you catch it. I am not going anywhere at the moment. Takecare, and stay safe."
