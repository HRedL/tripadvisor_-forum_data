"I had booked two flight tickets and I cancelled those through the website of travelgenio 2month ago, because of corona virus outbreak. Travelgenio send me an email after a month saying that Cancellation will be processing and they would contact me. But they never contacted me and never send any reply, I kept sending them emails but they never reply until now. Today is the departure day , but Travelgenio hasn't even cancelled tickets , So Flight company (garuda indonesia) has send me an email today . we are "" no show "" !!! what the xx, I still can' t believe that Skysanner and tripadvisor still approve that this kind of company is able to work and do this awful things. Please ban this company and never ever ever ever use travelgenio when you want to travel. I can't beleive they don't even answer the phone at all."
"There are already dozens of threads warning about Travelgenio, so there was no need to start yet another one.>>I still can' t believe that Skysanner and tripadvisor still approve that this kind of company<<Skyscanner and TripAdvisor do not ""approve"" any company. The links on both those sites are paid adverts. Your local newspaper does not check on its advertisers, and nor do commercial web sites.>>I can't beleive they don't even answer the phone at all<<Travelgenio is located in Spain, and that country is in total lockdown."
Were these refundable tickets? Most tickets are non-refundable so you should not expect anything back. You cancelled ..... different story if the airline cancelled.

Could you contact me please? keith.raleigh1@gmail.comFlight booking number with malindo air was IEXBUN. DBNNLN was the booking number with Travelgenio."
"Don’t put your email address in public forums, Keith, unless you wants tons of spam."
"It's not a good idea, and it's completely pointless unless you're due to travel in the next three days. In which case it's half pointless."
Similar problem for me. Travelgenio are a DISGRACE and should be OUT OF BUSINESS!
"So you can find this forum to complain, but you couldn’t do any research before you hit buy?And you think posting here will stop others from your mistake, right? No there’s a sucker born every minute and then all of them but from Shanky airfare sites instead of going directly to the airline.Just because TripAdvisor links you there doesn’t mean you have to purchase there. engage your brain, do some critical thinking, quit assuming that somebody else is doing research for youConsider it a lesson learned. Before you hit buy on the Internet do some researchEdited: 7:49 am, April 16, 2020 "
"Keith R there is no need to send any more support tickets. Yours, if you sent them through our site, are registered and will be replied asap. Receiving duplicate petitions won't help us hurry the replies. Moreover, right now we are dealing with a reply time longer than usually because the many queries received in the current situation. As soon as possible you will be contacted. Talking about refunds, they will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"

"You cancelled your flight, why would you expect a refund. Had the airline cancelled it you’d receive a refund eventually less Travelgenio’s usual fees. As you cancelled you are entitled to your taxes back less the fee, these maybe more than the taxes."
