Hello everyone.I am looking to plan to visit Tanzania and Zanzibar for wildlife safari and the beaches in the first week of April 2020 for around 10 days.I have been told that it will be peak rainy season and it is not the best time.Can you please guide me as to what kind of weather can i expect in April and will it be a good time to visit the Serengeti and Zanzibar?Thank you.
"You can still do and enjoy your trip but just keep in mind that you are doing it in rain season and when you see some of the time its raining, then your are not surprised. April is one of our rain month but honestly as am typing we are all loosing control, nobody can predict how much it will rain in April as it has been raining since October 2019. Who knows, you might experience short time rains or serious raining, though it is normally rain and stop so you can still enjoy some game drives. If you are flexible with time, I would suggest you travel from 10th May whereby it starts to dry and also you can still win the low season rates too.If time is an issue, go ahead with your plans in April, am sure you will be still enjoying the trip.Karibu Tanzania,Bright safaris team"
"You can visit Tanzania in AprilLess cars, so green and great for game drive but make sure your TO book those lodges are easy to access (easy to reach)But you can visit following parksLake manyara national parkNgorongoro crater tour Serengeti national park in Central Serengeti Fly out from Serengeti to Zanzibar Climate change up and down nowadays"
"Yes April is presumably peak rainy season but the climate seems to have changed a lot these days. It may not even be heay rains as has been in the past.However April is low season and the rates for the lodges/ camps are much lower.You will enjoy.Thanks.Edited: 1:45 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"It can be hot and humid in zanzibar with rainfall but as others have mentioned low season less tourists and green.Safarieyes has good advice and the parks to visit, especially the idea of the flight at the end.Edited: 3:27 pm, March 12, 2020 "
