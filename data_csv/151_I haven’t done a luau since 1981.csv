"Not been to those ones at all, but do be aware that Costco has a deal for the GW one."
"Every time I get dragged to a luau to entertain work people, afterwards my reactions range from wanting to take a long shower followed by a half dozen strong drinks hoping that my memory will be gone in the morning to wanting to perform seppuku."
I confess ... I have never been to a luau. Probably 30 trips to Hawaii and zero luau. Hawaiian music - love it. Raised on it. Hula - great ... but a luau does nothing for me. Some posters consider it a rite-of-passage or requirement for visiting Hawaii. I sure don't. And we field lots of posts about free hula and music at local venues. (No seppuku for me!)
You probably hit commercial luau in their prime. Don't ruin the memory.
What Honua advised above.
"What Kaeleku said........for the most part. I qualify it only because if you are bringing kids or newbies, it can be fun to take *them*........and because he left out throwing yourself from the top floor of the parking garage.Instead, see if there are any cool concerts or events at the MACC when you're here :-). Look at Nalu's for their ""dinner show"" options, and if Willie K is still able to perform, (and alive), perhaps see him. IMO, any of these are more fun and 'real' than a commercial luau."
"Sorry, can't help you because the only one in Wailea I went to was at the Marriott many years ago. I do like a luau. Been to 7 different ones on 3 different islands. If you want to spend the money I would go to the one at the Grand Wailea!!"
"Yep haven't been to a Luau since 1994, for all the reasons stated. For what it would cost you can have a really nice dinner somewhere, with really good food. ; )"
Then I would for sure look at the MACC........and maybe things like the O'o Farms tours or something more 'local' like that.
"Sad thing is there are still old school local shows out there, including in tourist venues. On Oahu, Jerry Santos and Olomana plays regularly at HHV. Their shows are filled with fantastic songs which they take the time to explain, and real and high-quality (Hawaiian) hula, and sometimes their friends show up to listen and join the show to play or dance. It is the closest a tourist is likely to get to the magic of a kanakapila session. And its free. But these shows are rarely full, people walk by thinking this is yet another lounge act, or race off to PCC to listen to people banging Tahitian drums and spitting fire. You know, Instagramable.Edited: 9:57 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"This post is great as it shows to new/infrequent visitors that this forum is real. Where else can you get a balanced view of big tourist traps - Luau, Molokini etc"
Did you enjoy the 3 you attended?

"Our family enjoyed the Old Lahaina Luau very much and to us, it was worth the cost. Having said that, I doubt we’ll go again unless we’re traveling with others who haven’t been. I actually attended Germaine’s Luau on Oahu a month prior on a different trip with a group. Night and day difference—cheesy is the word that comes to mind—and I would not recommend that one.Edited: 12:11 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"Our group of 15 friends (all adults) was considering booking the Old Lahaina Luau, but now you’ve got me thinking. May I ask what is the MACC? We will be staying one night in Oahu at the Illikai next to HHV—should we saunter over there for the music you mentioned? I thought since that place is so huge it would be packed with people, but from your description maybe not. We’ll also be staying at the Marriott Ocean Club in Maui so that’s where we were going to do the OLL...most in our group have not done a luau. Any suggestions for that area as an alternative where our group could have a good dinner, hang out and have some drinks, listen to music? We will have our own rental cars there. Thanks!"
