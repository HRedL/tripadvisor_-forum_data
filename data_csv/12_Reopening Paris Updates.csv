"Not understanding French finding the latest information is difficult. Could someone give updates on the situation in Paris regarding reopening popular tourist attractions and travel into and around the city? The basic guidelines as of today are the lockdown will end May 11, schools, retail and small museums will open, while cafes should reopen early June. No word yet on hotels, though apparently the Louvre may reopen June 2."
"There is no official word yet on when these things will reopen. While there has been plenty of speculation on this forum about when it might happen, it's just pure opinion and no one knows.Edited: 2:23 pm, May 05, 2020 "
"However the overriding factor is that France is closed to Americans unless they were already official residents - and that even those, if returning to France from a trip elsewhere, will have to observe 14 days quarantine.Even when France opens up a bit, that 14 day quarantine requirement is likely to remain in place for a long while."
"There is a strict 14-day quarantine for people entering the country, until at least mid-July. I don't know the details, but that is what my friend from California has told me. She has had to postpone her visit here."
Macron wants the Schengen zone to be closed to non-residents until at least September.
"The government will make an announcement on May 7th about exactly what can reopen in the various regions starting May 11th. Paris is still the most infected/affected zone so apart from being able to go outdoors freely (and not to any parks, which will remain closed), we won't be doing very much."
"Hopefully that will change. Personally the plan for my trip was to fly from California (low risk) to London, then take the train into Paris, not sure how that would work."
"AriLa As of what we know now, you would not be allowed on the Eurostar from London to Paris if you are not a citizen within Europe."
@6 I think EU will be looking at USA as one nation and thus whether you are from a low risk state or NYC I believe it will be the same...and given what Europe has been thru I have to think they will not want tourism from outside their borders for the near future.
"pirate pirate, I hope you will easily get a refund from Eurostar. I had a trip booked last week that obviously could not happen, and they readily gave me a voucher for future travel. For a refund, the procedure may be different, but I am sure they will give you one. Here is the link that I used. You can poke around and maybe find exactly what you need. https://tinyurl.com/yd8lnroc"
I can't imagine any country is going to allow Americans in for a while.Even within our borders we are making New Yorkers and people New Jersey quarantine for 14 days.
Knowing that France as extended the state of health emergency until July 24. I think it will still take sometime before Paris will fully reopen.It has also been discussed a few times that the borders outside of the Schengen area might not open before September.We are a long way from traveling times. except maybe in our own province/state/country where it will propably be possible sooner.
"The ""state of emergency"" doesn't mean that things will not reopen while it is in effect. It is just the legal framework to allow the government to make sweeping decisions on health matters. And that includes reopening things."
Somehow I doubt closing France to all non Europeans until September will be necessary. But if anyone has any updates maybe we can use this thread to post them here
"From a purely personal point of view, missing a trip to Spain that should have commenced in a few days time, my Paris trip, and I go mainly to visit Galleries & Museums each day, is due to begin on September 7th, for 7 nights.I fully expect that, with some restrictions, Hotels, Attractions and all internal travel will be open and operating by that date.The questions that I have to answer, to satisfy myself that a visit is the right thing to do, are as follows ...1) Are cross-border flights operating , with the usual schedules and no quarantine on arrival.2) Might there be a quarantine, perhaps two weeks, that I would have to do on my return home.3) With ""social distancing"" rules kept in place, can I have a reasonably comfortable time in the City and, being mobility restricted, not find myself in long queues.4) Finally, if Flights, Hotels, Attractions, Restaurants, Bars, Cafes, Parks etc are all open and operating, would I have any chance of receiving refunds or vouchers if I decided not to visit, because I hadn't yet had a vaccination. If I can satisfy myself, I am a solo traveller, that the answers to the first three of my questions are positive, then I will visit.Finally, having already gone through the procedures of Vouchers, cancellations and re-booking of Flights and Hotel dates, I am now waiting until at least August 1st before making a determination and looking at changes if necessary.Apologies for this long post but I thought it might help others who have a similar trip booked, or in mind, for that period. Keep well allAnthony K"
"Sure Kerouac but with a state of health emergency in effect, the state of mine of a country is probably not to reopen to millions of tourists all over the world and go back to ""normal"". Not after having fought so hard to try to get control over the virus.Things will most probably ease up for you. After for other Europeans in the Schengen area. But seeing how things are heading I would really doubt that other tourists will be back soon.Of course, no one knows exactly. But anyway, borders are still closed and September is mentionned more and more to reopen them to the rest of the world. It's not the time to plan a trip overseas this summer."
"On the plus side, it is not the time to cancel your September trips.Anthony K"
"<< September is mentioned more and more to reopen them to the rest of the world. >>I would like to be as optimistic. But I will not be pessimistic either, since things are going in the right direction on the western part of the continent at the moment (But Russia, yikes!).

Announced today. French borders will remain closed to all except residents until 14 June at least. Announced last month non Shengen/uk visitors will have to quarantine for 14 days on arriva. In force until October. ( 7 months from the announcement)
"Well our borders are unlikely to open ""for a very long time"". No one expects it to be before 2021"
"Does anyone know where it was announced that the French borders are closed to non residents through June 7th at least? I was supposed to fly to Paris with my daughter on June 4th on a boutique airline called La Compagnie that only flies between Newark and Paris Orly. Right now the airline is offering refunds for travel through May 31st but I would really like to get a refund instead of a voucher for my tickets for June 4th. My family had a bunch of international travel planned for this year which will all need to be canceled so I would like to get a refund where I can, given that it seems I wouldn’t even be allowed in the country as a tourist if I flew on June 4th!"
"@28, I have not found it written on the French government's website (perhaps it will be updated soon), but the Interior Minister said at the press conference on Thursday that the border restrictions with other European countries have been extended until at least 15 June. The border restrictions with other countries remain in place until further notice. Here is the clip (in French): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KaXQSI_FEQEdited: 10:25 pm, May 07, 2020 "
Edefran expresses it well and correctly. It seems that cross-border restrictions will stay in place for quite some months unless you are a UK or EU resident. Keep well allAnthony K
"My next thought on this issue is, because cross-border bans will be lifted for some travellers, but with some temperature testing, at Airports, but not full Covid-19 testing, might travellers be expected to carry a form or letter stating that they have been tested and do not carry the virus, perhaps, folded within your Passport?CheersAnthony"
"As has been pointed out by a number of doctors, a Covid-19 test is not even valid for 24 hours. (After all, the POTUS says that he is now being tested every day.) Antibody certification might be more useful but not yet, since they still don't know if people with the antibodies might transmit or catch the virus."

"Just to put the reopening of Paris in perspective, 60 metro stations will remain closed on May 11. Mine is one of them, and it has been closed since March 18. One thing that is interesting (and also understandable) is that they have closed both the emptiest and the busiest metro stations (for example Opéra and République).The metro is forbidden to the general public (non workers) from 06:30 to 10:00 and from 16:30 to 19:30. Everybody must wear a mask.Edited: 4:00 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"Well, they say Paris is a city for walking! Can't see that discouraging those fixated on their right to visit Paris."
"London also has many stations, on the underground, closed. Mainly those that are not interchanges to other lines.60 or so in Paris could be quite an inconvenience for visitors, like myself, who are mobility restricted, no matter how walkable the City is, these days.My only benefit might be that my Hotel on Avenue du Maine seems to be close enough, for me, to walk to one of three Metro stations and two RER and Metro stops. It would then require careful planning for when I reach my intended destination for alighting, at, say, St Paul to stroll to the Musee Picasso. Buses are often the answer, for both short hops and door to door services. Or, putting one's hand to one's wallet and having to grab the occasional Taxi, when exhausted after a days sightseeing and returning to one's accommodation. Planning, is an Art form when visiting a City, to know that you are grouping together what you wish to see each day without criss-crossing the City endlessly.Keep well allAnthony K"

"“ Can't see that discouraging those fixated on their right to visit Paris.” Visiting Paris is not a right. It’s a privilege. And it makes no sense right now, with parks, museums and restaurants closed. What would be the point?"
"Visiting, now, was not the most recent discussion. Crossing-borders is the biggest barrier to that.However, crossing borders in September, by virtue of being an EU member, may mean actually seeing Paris, without so many others crowding the scenery.C'est la vieAnthony K"
"Irony, phread...irony. Of course a visit - anywhere - is a privilege. It's one of the reasons countries issue visas. And of course it makes no sense to visit Europe now, with what attracts visitors unavailable - just to take the ""all the world is a theme park"" approach.It is all the more ironic then that several posts canvas ways around entry and sweat on the opening of borders. It seems to speak to an assumption of a ""right"" - in the ""I got me rights"" sense - to make visits, a right that is being somehow illegitimately frustrated by border controls, and dancing up and down will change that."
"That term ""fixated on their right to visit Paris"" was odd per @26...honestly while many here seem to be still hoping to visit this summer and looking for any signals of a return to normal I have never really noticed anyone referring to their ""right"" to visit. But I would agree it is implied by some. Frankly all the rights belong to the French (and foreign residents) that live there to protect their health and keeping their hospitals functioning for their needs. And returning to normal may take a very long time with or without a second wave of Covid and remember there are still many cases and deaths daily. I notice travel publications are now finally catching up and entitling their articles ""destinations to dream about"" which is a more realistic title. Here is US those places that are ""opening up"" ie shopping malls etc. are virtual ghost towns...they opened but no one came!Edited: 10:43 am, May 09, 2020 "
"""fixated on their right to visit Paris""...I don't get it. It's a rather strange comment. Hopefully, France, and all other countries will make decisions that are in the best interests of their citizens and residents. All others are guests who require legal ""invitation."" I think it is likely that the metro opening will precede the border opening and maybe border openings will be phased to start with the EU."

"I don't believe, at present, that I have a right to go to the end of my street; certainly not as often, at 5am, for fresh croissants, as I used to do. Cest la guerre.

Am I correct that right now hotels for the most part are closed until May 11. I note that most are taking bookings after that date. After that date all the rooms/accommodations that have been cancelled by international travelers could be booked by French or maybe EU travelers? If that is all correct it would then seem that those that did not refund due to cash flow should be able to do so if requested prior to the 18 months? Does that seem reasonable?
"@48 ""Does that seem reasonable?"" Not really. Even IF travel is permitted for French and EU/EEA residents, it's unlikely that it would be in large enough numbers to replace those coming from outside Europe."
"I have not heard much about hotel openings tomorrow but with travel severely restricted and all restaurants closed, it is not clear that there will be much demand for hotel rooms.Things should become more clear near the end of May as policy is defined and announcements are made June 2nd."

Having missed our trip to Paris in April I would love to be able to reschedule. However here in Australia our restrictions on international travel are going to be in place for some time ( I’m betting unti at least the end of the year) Hopefully I will be able to travel next April instead.
I made reservations for June of 2021 at a hotel I’ve been wanting to try in Paris. I got the rate I’m able to cancel. I know it’s way too early and maybe won’t happen but it made me happy to do it. I am putting off retirement until next June so this will be a big thing for us. We hope to go to Scotland after Paris for my husband to play golf. We will see.
"AriLa, Sorry to say, but there is no chance that the Louvre will open on 2 June. The earliest it might open is mid-July and it could be later than that."
"It was announced yesterday that the shopping malls of Paris (notably the Westfield Forum des Halles, Italie 2, Beaugrenelle and also Aéroville out at CDG) and also the main department stores like Galeries Lafayette and Printemps will remain closed at least until July 10th.Intra-European borders might reopen on June 15th, but this is not yet confirmed by all of the countries."
"""closed at least until July 10..."" and then looked at or, abracadabra, open on the 11th?How about - The Louvre, D'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Restaurants, Bars and Cafes ... if easy to group those?CheersAnthony K"
"Restaurants, bars and cafés are due to open in the green zone of France on June 2nd. But Paris is in the red zone, so we don't have any dates for that.A few small museums have reopened in Paris, such as the Musée de la vie romantique or the Giacometti Institute (which can accept ten people -- it is fully booked for the next week)."
I am in the middle of testing the 100km limit and I can say so far so good. 99km and no controls.
I didn't realise 99km was in the middle of a 100km journey! :)
"As for holidays, the government said yesterday that summer holidays should be able to take place in July and August with no particular problems unless there is an outbreak somewhere in France. The French will be able to take their holidays anywhere in the country, including the overseas departments.As for the June 15 date for European travel, there is a snag for the moment, because Spain still wants a 15-day quarnatine for anybody crossing the border. France has said it will impose a 15-day quarantine at the Spanish border out of reciprocity if Spain does that. Negotiations are in progress. To be continued..."
@81 that is good news for all in France....July and August with France open for them to move around. For me that means if anyone has hotels that are not refunding refundable bookings they will now have the opportunity to sell those rooms and have guests...and should therefore refund. Will be watching this closely. If EU travelers will be allowed even busier and good for local economy.
"Also, the SNCF opened booking for all trains operating in July and August today. It has been announced that 100% of trains will be operating during those months. It should not be forgotten, however, that only 50% of the seats are available… the other seats must remain empty."
"Gene, you keep saying that, but I think you're setting yourself up for profound disappointment. It is highly unlikely that there will be much demand for hotel rooms from French residents. I obviously don't have a crystal ball, but my conversations with French friends lead me to think that most will be spending their traditional summer holiday time chez eux. Or camping. But not in city hotels where you have non-refundable reservations."
I@84 yes you are correct I am sounding like a broken record and this is the Paris forum. My reasoning is that there are many residents in major cities in France that may well want to go spend some time in Provence or other places more appealing than Paris in July and especially August and I think they will be booking accommodations in those spots. My booking in in Provence for peak lavender week and I think it entirely possible that they will be getting bookings. There are many that can't afford to go anywhere but some certainly are still with money for travel and just might venture out. We will see. Just my theory. I agree however the last place to be getting many bookings would be the city hotels...not at all what I meant...but logical conclusion given this is Paris forum. K2 was talking about all of France and I just followed that.
47% of the French say they plan to go somewhere on vacation.10% plan to go to another country this year.70% want to go to the coast.20% want to go to the mountains.10% want a rural vacation.Things are sure to change before the vacation period starts.
"Kerouac You informed recently that Norway was keeping their borders closed until 20 August. I see that has been confirmed today. I know the EU is encouraging countries to open up the borders, I really don’t think that is a good idea at the moment. We’d like nothing better than to jump in the car and take Eurotunnel to Calais, but still can’t do that.I think our first holiday abroad will be in France, but I can’t see that happening until 2021.I think many countries will open up for domestic travel, possibly by the summer. I’m not sure how many people will want to go away, but one sure thing is prices will soar.In the meantime, at least we can continue to enjoy this good weather we have been having.Continue with your updates, very appreciated."

The following is courtesy of Heather Stimmler-Hall of Secrets of Paris:""Paris Museum Re-Opening ScheduleNo news about when the big museums like the Louvre, Orsay and Centre Pompidou will reopen, but small museums have been granted permission to reopen in Paris starting on May 11th.

Here are the dates and museums which have publicly announced openings:- June 2nd : Musée Marmottan Monet, Musée Jacquemart-André, L'Atelier des Lumières - June 16th: The municipal City of Paris Museums will be reopening the Musée Bourdelle, Musée de la Libération de Paris, Maison de Balzac, Musée de la Vie Romantique, the Catacombes, and the Musée Cernuschi. Only the temporary expositions will be open at the Petit Palais. The Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris and the Musée Cognacq-Jay won’t be opened until July and the Musée Zadkine will reopen in the fall. The Carnavalet, Palais Galliera, and the Maison de Victor Hugo will continue their renovations before reopening (possibly the fall or early winter). Check back with the official website of the City of Paris Museums in early June for the final schedule.- The private Musée de l’Illusion is also open as of May 14th, but I haven’t visited it yet so I’m not sure it’s really a museum or more of a gimmicky fun house.

If you are travelling from or through France, check the situation at your destination before you travel.""Thanks - keep wellAnthony K"
"June 15th for intra-European travel is still the target date for most countries. I don't think the French government will do much more communication about it until June 2nd when restaurants and cafés are expected to open in the green zone. That will make all of us in the red zone that much more impatient.This coming week, the priority is reopening more schools, not worrying about tourists."

And no social distancing?

"Yes, they are simple factual updates, not irrelevant waffle."
Add Mundolingua to the list of (small) museums that are re-opening on 18 May. http://www.mundolingua.org/
"The French PM just announced that cafes, restaurants, bars and parks can reopen in all areas of France on June 2, with some restrictions."
Is there an update on hotels...are they able to open or is that still in the future?
"A bit more about those restrictions: He announced that cafés, restaurants, bars and parks can open in the ""green zones"" of France, of which Paris is currently not a member. Paris is currently in the ""orange zone"", which means that the sidewalk terraces can open, but people cannot be seated and served inside of restaurants, cafés and bars. https:/…A9douard-philippe"
"There has never been any restriction of any kind on hotels. Hotels closed from a lack of customers, not by government mandate. Difficult to stay in a hotel when movement is otherwise restricted and there are no restaurants.Restaurants can open in Paris with terrace service only on June 2nd. The 100km travel restriction will also be lifted then but the French borders with other EU countries, and the UK, will remain closed at least until June 15. Borders with other countries remain closed."
"It was mentioned that restaurants will not be handing out contaminated menus in most cases. Of course some places will print a paper menu and others will suggest downloading their flash code on your telephone, but apparently the majority of places will just be using restaurant slates with reduced choices until further notice.Any of you who are not used to deciphering restaurant slates might want to start honing your skills:https:/…"
"Here's a link to a summary, in English, of what opens when (and where) in France. All parks open May 30. June 2 is the date for most of France to open cafe, restaurant & bar terraces, beaches, monuments & museums (masks required), and malls. No indoor dining in Paris till June 22. Sounds like travelers from the EU can enter France beginning June 15, if their country allows them to leave. Still no word on when travelers from outside the EU will be allowed to enter.secretsofparis.com/heathers-secret-blog/…"
"For those planning trips to France in the near future, there are several points or clarifications of the previous post which might be important:From June 2nd, there are no travel restriction within France.From June 15th, French borders will generally open for those from other EU countries to include the UK. France will reciprocate the restrictions imposed by any other country. For example, quarantines may be imposed by the UK or Spain. Large shopping centers, defined as those with more than 40,000 ㎡, remained closed by government order. In Paris, le Bon Marché has been open but Galeries Lafayette and le Printemps have been closed. I am not sure of the size of these flagship stores and cannot specifically say when they will open. The big shopping centers outside of Paris will remain closed.Restaurants and bars outside the Ile de France will open June 2nd but with physical distancing requirements for tables. Within the Ile de France, only outside dining will be authorized. I have not found any date, such as June 22nd, by which restaurants within the Ile de France will open their interiors.For travel from outside the EU, June 15th is the date by which the EU will evaluate opening borders to non-EU countries. June 15th is NOT specifically when borders open to non-EU travelers wanting to enter France."
"So much is now, also, dependent on the actions of the Airlines, when borders are eventually re-opened.Can Airline operators provide a service, if they have to obey the rules on Social Distancing.Keep well allAnthony K"
Printemps filed a request with the Préfecture and reopened yesterday.
"K2No doubt his wife had the Credit Card, and the three of them were getting hungry. Anthony K"
"I think Galeries Lafayette opens tomorrow, but Parisians don't really care all that much. On the evening news yesterday, they showed all of the people queueing up to get into Primtemps and interviewed one woman who said ""I just want to walk around, not buy anything. Everything is much too expensive; it's all for tourists.""Anyway, both Galeries Lafayette and Printemps already had stores open in Paris. Galeries Lafayette at Beaugrenelle and on the Champs Elysées were already open as was Printemps Nation. Printemps Italie 2 is still closed."
"I didn't repost but it was in the newspaper that starting tomorrow, all retail in Paris is open. The grand surface or big box outlets (greater than 40 000 m2) which are outside of Paris are to remain closed UFN."
"Only a few stores at the Westfield Forum des Halles will be open. All of the stores at Canopée (ground) level, but in the lower levels only the opticians, the pharmacy and FNAC."
"K2With hygiene in mind, alongside need, especially for those with restricted mobility, can you confirm that all conveniences will be opened, and staffed, properly, as soon as Malls and Department stores are open. Anthony K"
"Sorry, I cannot confirm anything. I am not the king of Paris."
Latest news indicates that the Louvre is preparing to open on 6 July.
That's great news for those of us in France (and Europe). Too bad for the rest of you.
"Hello,I booked a train ticket to Paris on June 15th when the border is open. However, I have not decided on how long to stay. Typically, I prefer to stay for a week. Unfortunately, it seems many places will still be closed then. Since I live in Frankfurt at the moment, it will not be an issue to come back again. Are there still plenty of places to fill my schedule if I stay for a week? I have been to all well-known attractions more than once except for Eiffel Tower.Thanks"
"What tourist attractions besides the Montparnasse Tower Observation Deck will be reopening June 2, and I know that attraction is reopening then. I also know that the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre will be closed a while longer to come up with a plan to reopen safely."
Here's a link to Secrets of Paris' latest updated list of museum openings:secretsofparis.com/heathers-secret-blog/…
"My hyper mall was packed solid today. All shops open. People everywhere. Only a couple shops requiring masks to enter. About 50% of the people had a mask somewhere on their body, just around the neck seems to be trending. I guess the motion is to snap it up on entry and snap it back off anywhere in the exit process. I noticed bars on my main street are being creative on how to open pre June 2nd as well. Almost appears as a free for all, open open open.Shoot! I was about to buy my first mask and obey, not question, not think. Snap. Well maybe I will buy a Fauci mask as a souvenir anyway. Viva the reopening!"

"The SNCF has announced that as of mid June, 100% of the seats on its trains will be bookable."
"No social distancing on trains? Seems like seats should be blocked to prevent passengers sitting too close.Edited: 1:42 am, June 01, 2020 "
That's how it is now and that's what is ending in mid June.
Masks to be worn?
"Yes, masks are mandatory (in all public transport actually).Edited: 5:31 am, June 01, 2020 "
"Any mask or are the prolonged use masks causing irreversible brain damage only accepted.? Been reading up on OSHA 19.5 percent oxygen federal law requirements and prolonged mask use seems to be detrimental and illegal. Occupational Safety and Health Administration says nothing about scarves so is a red bandana okay for transport?""Effects of exposure to low oxygen concentrations can include giddiness, mental confusion, loss of judgment, loss of coordination, weakness, nausea, fainting, loss of consciousness and death. The immediate effects of low oxygen environments are due to our body's oxygen transport system."""
"It has clearly affected your brain, ATF."
Jackboots if the question is too difficult for you maybe try removing your mask before answering.
"Has all that fresh country air out at Rambouillet made you soft ATF? Don't Parisians on the other hand have to cope with vehicle exhaust gases, close quarter travel on the Metro and the buses, and the persistent haze of cigarette smoke that hangs around the chairs and tables outside the side by side cafes? Perhaps the necessary removal is the mote in thine own eye?[illustration of a mote in an eye: ;-)]Edited: 4:31 am, June 02, 2020 "
It's a real simple question.Try to focus. Which mask designs are authorized?Homemade for example? Dust mask? Bandana?
They are all authorized because they are just imaginary protection.

"HR, what's the word... I actually broke out the emergency throwaway mask for tilling the farm land today. Hasn't rained in a month and been 99 degrees in the shade worse than the 1920s dust bowl.Hence, I am wearing a mask, LOL. And it is protecting me from the millimetre dust particles even though when I wear the damn thing it feels like I can't breathe.5 hour train ride is going to be tough unless a bandana is authorized."
Any mask as long as it covers mouth and nose
"ATF: I believe you are misinformed on mask wearing. Checked this out and found the following, which I'm cutting and pasting directly from Snopes.com: What's TrueBreathing in excessive carbon dioxide is dangerous for the body. Some people with preexisting respiratory illnesses may face health issues only with prolonged use of tight-fitting masks, such as respirators. What's FalseHowever, people wearing cloth or surgical masks are in little to no danger of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide."
"ATLBob, what a nice convivial and cordial reply, no adolescent narcissism, no condescending patronizing, just pure discourse, how refreshing. Let's share a beer one day.  Although over 3,000 architects and engineers disagree with Snopes over Building 7, even a broken clock is correct twice a day, so a N33 mask is good enough for me.I would like to obey the authority to the point of my personal comfort level travelling by train, sort of like having a support animal on a commercial airplane flight.I can't breathe with the current mainstream masks so I hope a bandana will pass the vigilantes.

"Post 159, my medical and professional career dealt with gas flow and designing systems for air transport. Additionally, I have 1000's of hours wearing masks of all types in surgery and in positive and negative pressure situations and applications.

"I just wanted to say thank you to those of you who have been posting status updates and information regarding the reopening of Paris. The information is greatly appreciated and helpful for those of us far away. We have had a trip planned for early August which, I know, is 99.76% chance of not happening but we can still hold out the smallest of hopes that it will. Maybe another time. Be safe to all of you."
The Quai Branly Jacques Chirac museum in Paris has reopened. Online bookings only.
"#169 -- Navigator, it depends where you're from. Borders in the EU are opening now, and other countries will be allowed to start returning gradually in July (tho US tourists probably won't be in that first group). The next update regarding travel will come on June 15, so be watching for that. I'd give you slightly better odds than .24% if you're from the US....perhaps 5-10%...but no one really knows yet. Good luck!"
"From the Eiffel Tower's Facebook page today:The Eiffel Tower is re-opening on June 25th! Specific measures are put in place to ensure your safety:- All visitors (from 11 year’s old) shall wear a face mask - At first, only visits by the stairs, up to the 2nd floor will be available. To ensure that ascending and descending visitors do not meet in the stairs, ascent will take place from the East pillar and descent by the West pillar- The number of visitors on the esplanade and on each floor will be limited. Signage is installed to implement physical distancing.- Daily cleaning and disinfection of public spaces.The re-opening date of our online ticket office will be soon communicated on our website and social networks"
"Oh, I should also mention that the zoo in the Bois de Vincennes has reopened. Online bookings and timed tickets."

"Gare Paris Montparnasse requires a mask at all times.No food for eating on the train ride neither.Apparently the WHO changed its mind again from its recent statements about asymptomatic people not likely to infect others.CDC has new basic flu comparison numbers in their maze of stats if one can find them.Fauci was looking good when he wrote those same basic flu numbers for the New England Medical Journal.Anyone do the math on dividing the number of infected to the global population?8 million infected in June 2020 of 8 billion people: 0.001%What is 422k deaths of 8 billion people? 0.00005275%Oh I get Fauci now, finally, where he said people didn't need masks in March but now he has been wearing one or not since I haven't seen him recently. I hope he is back working on his funding for the Wuhan Lab again. 0.00005275% is amazing how that number has flipped the world.Chartres soon.."
"The population of the world is 7.8 billion.1% of that is 78,000 000.0.1% is 780,000.0.00005275% is a grand total of 412 people.Have you been to school?"
"Jackboots, at least your first calculation made it before the batteries died.178.

"(422 000/7 800 000 000)*100 = 0.00541026% of the global population, which is an astonishingly high figure in such a short period of time. Your fatal flaw, ATF, was not multiplying the decimal by 100 to get the percent. ""Apparently the WHO changed its mind again from its recent statements about asymptomatic people not likely to infect others."" --> It hasn't. Those comments were taken out of context, and the WHO has walked back that statement. It remains the case that asymptomatic people can infect others. I'm not entirely sure why you're trying to paint this as a, paradoxically, nothing-burger and massive conspiracy at the same time."
"ATF’s arithmetic predicated on the 8 billion global population and those figures are accurate, though the ‘%’ at the end of his numbers are perhaps typed inadvertently. Multiplying those figures by 100 will result in respective percentages (i.e. The COVID mortality rate -> 0.00005275 * 100 = 0.005275% of 8 billion). If we assume a different global population (i.e. 7.8 billion), of course, the figures will change."
"The biggest problem, is all of these statistics are being analyzed way to soon.We still have a woefully small data set to do any real projection.For example comparing to season flu is somewhat dubious. Season flu infection rate (and even mortality to some extent) is based on years of data for interpretation.Many people get a temperature, chills, etc., stay home a few days and never visit a doctor or get a flu test. That is taken into account when statistics about the flu are published. The rate is based on both actual cases (doctor visits) and historical extrapolation of unreported cases, rather than only tested/confirmed cases like COVID-19. Not to mention that flu statistics are yearly, this has been around for a few months.I'm not say that supports either side of argument, just saying it's too early to know much -- you can't calculate statistics using different methodology and call them comparative.Edited: 3:27 pm, June 12, 2020 "
"Also, we don't know what the death toll would have been if no measures had been taken. You can't say ""the death/cases count is low so that shows there was no need to take those drastic measures"" when the drastic measures are a good part of the reason why the count is low (and BTW, I don't actually feel the numbers are low)."
One death is one too many.Anthony K
"Thanks hrh750, this incredibly high number 0.005% mortality rate for the world needs more restrictions not reopening, there is a second wave and Macron avoided that subject like the plague.What did Doctor Fauci write in the New England Journal of Medicine: ""Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%)""Imagine if this extremely high number 0.005% reaches that of the flu 0.1%.Apparently the Second Wave has already started if you Google it.Paris should be locking tighter down not reopening, it's a pandemic."
">> Imagine if this extremely high number 0.005% reaches that of the flu 0.1%. <<ATF, not sure if you are purposely mixing your statistics, typing too fast, or just confused about the difference between decimals and percentages. The mortality rate for a severe flu season is 0.01%, not 0.1%As I mentioned previously, we are way too early into this to make a fair assessment and comparing flu to COVID-19 is spurious as best for a variety of reasons (again as I mentioned).Just to deal with your numbers. You can't use one statistic (mortality rate across the entire population) to compare to another type (mortality rate of cases). Use one or the other - as a percent of the population or as a percent of those infected. The use of decimals vs. percent vs percent of percent is only obfuscating the numbers. It is much clearer to just look at raw numbers.The .01% mortality rate is for a very high flu mortality rate as plotted, against the entire population (or per 100,000). That would amount to 780,000 deaths - with a ""typical"" rate being 250,000 to 450,000.We currently are at 435,000, so we are already in the high-end of a typical flu and still adding thousands of deaths a day. Is it your belief that had none of the quarantining and lock-downs happened, that number wouldn't be much higher at this point? All one needs to do is look at countries that choose not to lock down; Sweden for example currently has a rate of .045% (or more than 4 times a severe flu season).Edited: 10:18 am, June 15, 2020 "
I continue to think that ATF is running a fever.
"The lockdown slowed down the spread but has not stop the spread and googling ""second wave covid"" shows current news about the resurgence of the spread spiking in China, Israel, maybe Spain, etc.EuroNews: Coronavirus: Fears of second wave as cases spike in ChinaHere's the Guardian: Europe should brace for second wave, says EU coronavirus chief A quote from BBC: But for Jennifer Rohn, a cell biologist at University College, London, a second wave of coronavirus infections is no longer a matter of ""if"" - but of ""when, and how devastating"".Doctor Fauci syas: ""This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza"" So re-open and cross our fingers everyone behaves or plan on blaming people for being people. Social distancing seems to be lost everywhere from street protests to café terraces.In the meantime, from France24: Covid-19: ""France, Italy, Germany and Netherlands sign vaccine deal for Europe... The agreement is the latest in a series to make the vaccine — even though it is not certain it will work. But so desperate is the need that scaling up of manufacturing continues despite the risk.""Who is going to take that risk from a rush job?Probably everyone after a second wave.Re-open, cross your fingers, behave.Or not, Bill.ions will be made.+Jackboots, thanks for sharing your powerful thoughts like a real leader. You have my constant positive reinforcement whenever you need it."
"The Pauci article you are citing (and using wrongly) was published on Feb 28th, and is based on the analysis of two studies in China with a grand total of 1424 patients. As far as our knowledge of the virus goes, that's a lifetime away. Current estimate of case fatality rate from Covid are between 0.2 and 1.5% (more likely in the mid range, but hard to be more precise as we don't know the actual case numbers and fatalities numbers).And this is the whole sentence, to put the figure of 0.1% in context : ""This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively"". BTW, the pandemic influnzas of 1957 and 1968 are estimated to have killed 1 to 2 million people in the world (each), while about 500 to 800 people died in the big MERS and SRAS epidemics."
"Isn't the general consensus that had the lockdown happened earlier it would have saved lives, so why isn't that belief applied to the second wave which is apparently on deck."
"There are numerous websites with all kinds of data, graphs, charts, stats and other info for just about every country on the planet. I usually check worldometers.info, though there are many similar websites. No need to debate stats when everything ""that is possible to know"" is only a google search away."
"Had really nice Mexican cuisine last night in the 11th arrondissement a couple streets away from Place de la République. The narrow side street was busy with every café open had their street-side tables packed.The art showing studio (cool place, open to public) was packed too, nothing but Old Normal happening on this street in Paris, hugs, kisses, sharing food & drinks, no masks except 2 people all evening, etc. No way to tell the old normal had been eradicated from the french culture, we even had plenty of cigarette smokers.So if we're all doomed to repeat history then I suggest a delicious Mexican made taco in a local Parisian café, Café Chilango: https://www.cafechilangoparis.com/"

"In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment, a contagious disease will progress until enough people are immune to make transmission difficult. A lockdown cannot change this. It happens in all epidemics and regularly in the case of seasonal flu.The only thing that separates Covid-19 from other seasonal flu epidemics in practical terms is the hysteria deliberately whipped up around it by the media and politicians, each for their own different and not at all altruistic reasons. The pandemic did not justify destruction of the world economy, just as previous pandemics of respiratory infections with equally low mortality have not. But the damage is done now, and those who did it will probably try to rationalize their huge, gargantuan mistake for the rest of their lives. If Parisians return to the ""old normal,"" so much the better, as the completely arbitrary measures imposed by the government on the population have not been subjected to experimental verification and are mostly made up and ineffective. The one thing that might be a good general idea is washing one's hands after using the toilet, but that recommendation has been drowned in the avalanche of other theater and will probably not be embraced by the population, so ""gastro"" falling from the sky will continue to afflict it."

So Covid-19 is just a seasonal flu? Euromanic...Trump....Putin....Bolsonaro...Up there with the best medical minds in the world.
"Covid-19 is grossly similar to seasonal flu in a great many respects, yes. But the quintessence of hysteria is an unwillingness to listen to reason, so it's unlikely that any decision maker or demagogue will ever own up to starting another Great Depression (if that be the case—that, too, depends in part on hysteria) for a seasonal flu."
Comparisons of Covid-19 to seasonal influenza are highly disingenuous. Both Covid-19 and the virus that causes it are still very much unknown entities. To pretend otherwise is the height of foolishness and arrogance (which often go hand in hand). https:/…why-covid-19-isnt-the-flu

"Just about everything can reopen in France as of 22 June -- cinemas, casinos, even some theatres.As of 11 July, collective sports are authorized with a public of up to 5000 people. Also racetracks.Combat sports such as judo and boxing remain forbidden."
"The schedule of reopening seems largely random; at least it's hard to see any scientific reasons behind it. I don't see why boxing or judo present a special hazard. And some reopenings are so burdened by arbitrary restrictions that I wonder how businesses can stay open. Some fast-food places have set up such an obstacle course inside to buy food that I'm skipping them for now. And I don't now how many people will be willing to make reservations just to go see a movie: they may have been willing to do that for a roadshow widescreen presentation of Ben-Hur in 1959, but today they have Netflix, and the screen is the same size as the multiplex.As far as tourists are concerned, there aren't any in Paris right now. Versailles has only 16% of its normal visitors, so some Parisians are taking advantage to visit it. Lots of the city is being rediscovered by the locals while the crowds are gone. But this is bad news for the tourism industry."
I have seen absolutely nothing about a requirement to make a reservation to go to the movies.
"Le Parisien talked about ""reservations"" but I didn’t look into it in detail, since I stopped going to movie theaters years ago. It should not be a concern for tourists since I imagine they don’t spend their time in Paris going to see American films subtitled in French."
I hope this behaviour doesn't set things back in Paris :https://www.facebook.com/watch/…https://www.francetvinfo.fr/sante/maladie/co…I cannot believe this behaviour on a weekend where the WHO indicates the highest number of cases reported since the pandemic began. I have seen irresponsible people in Ireland and the UK but I thought Parisians would be more responsible than this.
">>>As far as tourists are concerned, there aren't any in Paris right now.There are a lot of tourists in Paris right now. They are just not from North America."
">> From where ? Any asians ? <<I would think France and much of Europe, would make up a decent chunk of the tourists."
">>>>>From where ? Any asians ?Very interesting that you might say that. The day, a few weeks ago, that le Bon Marché opened, and ever since really, there has been a line of young Asian at the Chanel boutique. It would have otherwise been unremarkable but I wondered, under the current circumstances, where they all came from?It strikes me as odd as the line is there just like it always has been. I actually asked one of the Chanel sales ladies from where might have all of these people come? She just smiled."
"Putting aside the fact that Harold is a troll who has gone by many names (e.g., Quincy, Anouk, David, Zeke, Violante, et al.) and sends vulgar and obscene PMs to other forum-goers, is it possible that the people you've seen queuing up at the Chanel boutique are French residents of Asian heritage rather than tourists from Asia?"
"Not necessarily French, but there are lots of Asians or people of Asian heritage living everywhere in Europe. I don't understand why so many people seem to be surprised by this. In France alone, there are 600,000 ""Chinese"" residents, including 50,000 Chinese students."
"Ignore Harold, he/it is an illiterate troll."
"With real French people right now having an IPA at a street side café. No masks, no anti social distancing, plenty of hugs and kisses. The bonus is the sun, sets at 11:30pm.Thinking Chartres is on deck for the week's heatwave. I'll look for more real French people."
"Harold, has just sent an abusive personal message to me. It is just a troll."
Exactly 11pm at night and I can almost see the setting sun. Probably the best part of being at the end of a time zone. Thank Odin we are reopen here. Cheers everyone!
Took the train to Chartres. Currently standing on the Labyrinth in almost peace and quiet. About 4 people in here.The Chartres train station was interesting with plenty of security forcing the mask guidelines. A young adult was completely surrounded and was not getting allowed in so he signalled to me for the mask I was wearing and I gave it to him then left. I am cycling back to Rambouillet anyway. Plus I carry a second one which is obligatory inside this big asp church..)
"So rather than give him your spare mask, which you had not worn, you handed him a mask that you had been wearing and breathing on for some time. This not seem a healthy measure.Anthony K"
The Orsay reopened today.
It’s been announced that the light show La Nuit aux Invalides will take place from July 18 - August 29. https://lanuitauxinvalides.fr/
"Doctor Anthony it was his idea and my second mask, a completely different valuable item, which had been worn was not an option.I traveled with the guy on the train and he blatantly had no interest in following mainstream guidelines in the first place. I guess he had a connection..? There were others on the train who also eschewed the guidelines and avoided getting caught living in their truth.Doctor, you may want to rethink your visit here if the French being fed up with the new normal is all you will focus on. I'm approaching Maintenon on this gorgeous day in the countryside with a riverside pain au chocolat pit stop. The clock is ticking so back at the grinding gears."
"When I visit I will focus on the beauty of Paris, as usual.Hopefully, come September, masks will not be mandatory. Keep well allAnthony K (who is not a Doctor.)"
"Looks like the tourists have not returned to Fauchon, the iconic gourmet food retailer with its flagship store on the place de la Madeleine: it has just entered the equivalent of Capter 11. Management says that Yellow Jackets, followed by strikes, followed by demonstrations, followed by months of lockdown, have driven it to the brink. Hédiard folded a few years ago, so there won’t be a gourmet shop at the Madeleine if Fauchon goes under."

"The EU is considering its list of countries whose citizens will be allowed entry on 1 July. Notably, the USA is not on the list. We should know more detail next week but EU representatives in Brussels have so far indicated that visitors from Brazil, Russia, and the USA will not be included in the July opening of the EU. These countries could be added to the approved list at a later date.Also of note is that Brussels is warning all 27 members of the EU that failure to restrict entry to those not on the list could lead to the reintroduction of borders within the bloc. This would seem pointed directly at countries such as Portugal and Iceland which have announced that they are opening their borders to US tourists.https:/…Edited: 3:53 am, June 24, 2020 "
"Note that Iceland is currently testing all the passengers arriving at Keflavik airport (only point of entry at the moment), and people who are positive or were seated in the plane next to a person tested positive must go in quarantine for 14 days. If they have the testing capacity to keep on doing this, I think they might be OK with reintroducing border controls between Iceland and EU to save their tourist season."
"I don't know why any Country wouldn't consider restricting tourism from the US and other Countries currently having COVID-19 issues for at least the time being. It's a matter of Public Health. It just bothers me when a Country opens their borders (or is assumed to be planning to) to another Country and then I read on here some people on their high horse saying 'how dare people from those other Countries consider traveling'. It is the Country or Region that makes the decision to allow or not allow tourism and thus it is the Country's responsibility if people come and the virus spreads, not the tourists. Places where tourism drives or contributes to the economy have to make very tough decisions right now, but the accountability for those actions falls on them not those that come once they are given the green light to do so. If it were me, I'd have shut things down longer to drastically reduce numbers and be overly cautious like IMO NY (and many other places) did. But, it's not up to me. I also would not be quick to allow tourists from any place still seeing a high number of COVID cases. There is a rush to save businesses of course, but opening too early could end up much worse and cause an additional and more painful shutdown"
"Just because you get the green light to do something irresponsible it doesn't mean you have to do it. It has nothing to do with being on a high horse, it is about saving lives. If Trump gives you the green light to do something would you really do it? It is easy to blame governments to pretend to convince yourself that personal responsibility isn't paramount."
"When you give the green light people will come. There is zero doubt people will come. That is the point. Thinking otherwise is dumb so if you aren't ready then don't give the green light.If a Country is dumb enough to open borders before they should or to tourists from a high risk area, they are responsible for what happens. If you rely on a random person from some other Country to make decisions about your Country's Public Health (excluding of course people who knowingly may be infected or have had contact with someone who is or may be) you are acting recklessly. If you don't want tourists from a particular area, don't allow it. How is that not just common sense? How in the world can people give a pass in any way whatsoever to a Country who bears responsibility for protecting its people and try to a blame a random person who comes (likely after being enticed with bargains too) when even two people within the same Country can't agree on what precautions are appropriate or not? If France or any other Country opens up to US citizens (or Brazil or the UK) and the virus follows then shame on them. If a person leaves their front door wide open and then is surprised when a burglar walks in they aren't very smart."
"If you ask me personally I'd never travel right now first and foremost for my own safety. I have been tested (as well as anti-body test) and will need to do so again over the Summer to bring my daughter to School but even right after a test and knowing I'm likely virus free I wouldn't travel. I can't imagine being on a plane with a mask for 8 hours and spending a week plus walking around a foreign Country with a mask on and worried about what I touch. I can't imagine risking my own health being around people I don't know that may make me sick and yes I of course worry about getting someone else sick as well if somehow I become infected. But not everyone approaches things that way. You have to expect some people to act recklessly which is why these rules are in place and why relaxing them too quickly is a mistake. If I go out without a mask and get sick, I can't blame the person that got me sick, I blame myself for not taking every necessary precaution to protect myself. It's the same for a Country. I saw the pics of I think it was a music festival in Paris (?) with no masks or social distancing. I'm not putting myself around those reckless people and I wouldn't expect others to either, but someone will and then trouble will follow. We all our responsible for our own actions and we all need to be accountable for what happens because of those actions"
"My town hall has approved and is having an Apéros musical garden party all weekend. Drinks, kissing, hugs, no masks, live music, snacks, dancing. Since I will be going I don't mind relaying the message from the Paris forum how foreigners feel about French people. What is the message exactly for these idiot brain dead murderers.

"The UK and the US are two of the countries worst hit by this virus, two countries with enough 'dumb' people to elect numbskull Trump and Boris the clown. You don't have to venture far outside your own door to find 'dumb'."
"I hope you'll be wearing your MAGA cap, ATF."
"I'll stay out of Politics because it shouldn't be allowed on a travel forum, but yeah there are a lot of people in the US acting very stupidly right now (and I assume the UK too based on your comment) and for the last couple of months and if France allows visitors from the US right now it makes them even dumber on the topic.As far as being hit hard by the virus goes, while it often is, it isn't necessarily an indication of a poor response. NY, like parts of Italy, was too far gone before we even knew the virus was here. The key is for areas that don't have a problem to shield themselves when possible. NY shut down and stayed shut down and now has the virus under control at least in part. NY also has just issued a travel advisory to not go to certain areas. How we act plays a huge role in how bad the virus situation will be in the near future. If you don't have a problem, take every precaution to keep it that way and if you do, take every precaution to try and overcome it."
"Jackboots, funny but true, I didn't know what that was until someone explained it to me in 2018. Again my town is French and we will be exercising our rights as the French people did in the 11th in Paris last week. Same as the festival in Paris this past Sunday. 10,000 new cases should be in the news any day now. It is what it is, French people in France reopening.."
"Pertinent to travelers from the USA, the EU may not be open for a while yet."
"Being French gives you no right to be irresponsible, every health organisation in the world is advocating social distancing, no unnecessary contact in the form of handshakes, kissing etc. It is sheer arrogance, nothing else."
"Ok so that's the message. I will try to get some feedback with that.In the meantime, if I see responsibility outside of what is forced guidelines I will report that too. For example, not including the young adults on the train the other day we all wore our obligatory masks. We also respected the obligation masks entering the Chartres cathedral. Anyone entering a shop requiring masks do the same.But that's it for the most part. Masks and anti social distancing is not happening in Paris, Chartres, Versailles or my town. There is no new normal where it is not required. I will ask as many people tomorrow evening at the garden party what they think of your message.France is reopening the French way so visit or don't."
"I won't be visiting this year, but you seem to be supporting their irresponsible arrogance. As we say in Ireland a dose of Covid might soften your cough!"
"I just said I wear a mask everywhere it is required, and anything else, washing hands, etc..lol But I get it, I have a Libra moon and a Libra ascendant so the right accuses me of being left and the left accuses me of being right. Think of the edge of a coin, we're not many but we're happier than either side. I'll add your wishes to your message to the French people tomorrow evening reopening France for your arrival."
Don't bother...wearing a mask won't fully protect your from droplets so you are also part of the arrogance. Just come out and say you support them without engaging in waffle. A dose of covid might take the arrogant edges off people.
"So what is it that you want French people to do? All those Paris kids at the festival get Covid?? You wish that. And then you arrive?Having duck confit tonight, you're invited. I have Libra energy running through me man, no waffles. 1. LIBRA (September 23 - October 22)One of the reasons that Libras have a hard time making a decision is because they want to have the best possible outcome. They may just be about to decide on something and then hesitate about whether they're making a good choice.They overthink and can come up with a few alternatives for every decision. They're careful and they have a difficult time living with their decisions. So what if they want to review all their options at the snack bar?"
"Just for those of you who are not in France, please do not believe the ATF's portrayal of the ""French way"" is accurate. The vast majority of people in Paris, including the young ones, are fully respecting the rules for hygiene and social distancing. In my own extremely mixed neighborhood, I would say that that the Africans, Indians, Chinese, Maghrebis are even more respectful of the rules than the ethnic French, since they don't want to do anything that could get them in trouble. Even the beggars are wearing their masks. But we are far from Rambouillet.Note: I am a Libra, ascendant Libra and I have no trouble making decisions or following reasonable rules.Edited: 2:34 pm, June 24, 2020 "

"Eiffel Tower is opening again today, at the moment only access by stairs and to the second level. In July, there will be some limited spots for lift access. Mandatory masks and distancing (not sure how that will go). Booking ahead is recommended.https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/news/events/…"
So they open the Tower and no-one with restricted mobility can enjoy it.Anthony K
"There are plenty of places that will never be accessible to people with limited mobility -- the catacombs, the towers of Notre Dame, the open air terrace of the Tour Montparnasse... to name just a few in Paris (and what about Mont Saint Michel?). Life will never be fair."
"I have limited mobility and accept the fact that some places are inaccessible, but instead of focusing on the negative, I think of the positive and all the places I can access. I find France in general, quite accessible."
Saw some extended footage...regarding the masks clearly sort of a lax enforcement...from my view close to 50% that did have them on had them UNDER the nose...a number had no mask on but did see one guard ask a guy to put one on. He did so for about one minute under his nose and then it can down more.
"As I have a Heart condition and a Lung problem, it has been accepted that I do not have to wear a mask, in the UK, which would exacerbate my breathing difficulties.I wonder if that will be accepted in Paris?Keep well allAnthony K"
Well with those two underlying medical conditions the importance of extreme social distancing can't be overstated. Apparently traveling with worth the risk as in many spots you simply cannot social distance as you travel....good luck and I guess you will need some proof of this exemption as so many indoor places require the mask.
It's very difficult to say anything about what the requirements will be at the time when Anthony travels. Currently it's changing almost on a weekly basis.
"I will keep a close eye on the situation. I have a letter, from my Doctor, explaining the conditions that I suffer from, in English, and I carry it when out in London. Anthony K"
Would security staff in London accept a medical letter in French? If lifts etc aren't open you just have to (as our American friends say) suck it up. You said a few posts ago you will be following all the rules when you go in September.

"Is it wise to travel? With heart and lung conditions, you would seem to be at a greater risk of dying from/with Covid-19 should you contract it. As you do not wear a mask, you would more easily spread the virus to others should you contract it. September is obviously a ways away, and a lot could change between now and then, but I hope you have good travel insurance."
"English is more of a universal language than French is.Yes, I believe in obeying the rules. But I do need a vacation.Anthony K"
"""English is more of a universal language than French is."" Not for the French."
"Oh là là Anthony.. if you believe the mainstream news and still plan to travel with underlying health conditions then you are quite courageous, bravo! However, you need to buy an oversize mask enormous in all dimensions that's super comfortable. You know I don't sugar-coat reality when I say you will be fined and hounded continuously for not wearing a mask where it is sign posted that it is obligatory. Really. That doctor's letter might as well be written on toilet paper.Even Uber requires masks so no avoiding that ride from the airport neither.Garden party starting soon, maybe Anthony you'll be coming out to the 5th zone of lawlessness after all or at least to the 11th arrondissement where no one is wearing a mask and having real tacos."
"Do tell: where can one find real tacos in the 11th arrondissement? In Paris - indeed, in all of France - I've only come across les tacos français, and those are foul."
"Anthony, everyone who breaks the rules has a 'but'. You are taking the lead of your compatriot Dominic Cummings. You might need a holiday but you want to get into a lift not wearing a mask...so like many you have an a la carte approach to the rules and your 'needs' are greater than the health of others.Edited: 10:16 am, June 25, 2020 "
"Anthony, you can go to the Netherlands. Apart from public transport, no one wears a mask anywhere."
I honestly would think that to constantly be faced with the mask situation and trying to avoid it ....a domestic holiday this year would be much more relaxing. I don't know what Paris is like right now but in US it is sort of getting to be the maskers vs the non maskers and ugly comments are being heard from both sides. I think any medical doctor being asked if travel is advised with those conditions and no mask would give the same advice...not this year. I know Anthony does not want to hear this but for anyone else I would think long and hard. I don't think the mask requirements are going to be gone in two months but just a guess based on medical experts' predictions.
"Garden party is not bad. Maybe the hardest would give the locals a 8.5 for effort. People respecting others outside their own universe of friends. The duo pretty good too, doing a mix of Spanish, Russian, French old and new. Local brewery beers only, €3 for each flavour. Pretty good here. No masks but outside each table bubble people are respectful."

"Both Brighton and Bournemouth beaches in England were packed yesterday where the authorities in Bournemouth declared a major incident. Locals took photos from their apartments overlooking the sea.

"I will confess that I have not yet eaten a French ""tacos"" (the singular carries an 's' for this word), but I am quite sure that they are not abominable, unless one has decreed that hamburgers and pizzas are also abominable. I am quite sure that they shock any visitor who imagines being presented with a taco of Western Hemisphere inspiration, that same as if you ordered spaghetti and were presented with mashed potatoes. Would that make the mashed potatoes bad?""Tacos"" were invented in a suburb of Lyon, and apparently they are good enough to have spawned at least 10 different chains all over France, not to mention the fact that just about any kebab stand now sells ""tacos"" as well. If they were so horrible, would they be so popular with the French?It must be admitted of course that just about all of these places are halal and appeal very much to the Muslim population. I guess that makes them automatically crummy to some people."
"I had my first French tacos in Lyon. I was not a fan of the rubbery minced beef, cheese sauce and mayo combination wrapped in a tortilla. As you note, it bears somewhat of a resemblance to a beefburger, so perhaps I need to check my own cultural biases. If given the choice, though, between a taco de pescado, un tacos français and a burger, I'd choose the taco de pescado every time. I will note, though, that I've always very much appreciated the free wifi offered by the O'Tacos in Nantes."
"Taco - The origin of this delicious dish is unknown, but according to Jeffrey Pilcher (a taco expert) the word originated from the silver mines in Mexico at around the 18th century. At that time taco referred to the little explosives workers used to extract the ore in the mines.Anthony KPS - Although we may be stupid enough to expect the French to quarantine for 14 days when visiting London, I feel that is a naff Government restriction which will soon be lifted.

After what we witnessed in Bournemouth and Brighton yesterday how can people from England expect no quarantine? You already said you won't wear a mask.

"To add to the confusion about museum names, in French we easily say ""le Louvre"" to talk about the museum (when you say ""Je vais au Louvre"" ie ""I'm going to the Louvre"", people understand immediately) but we don't say ""l'Orsay"" for the Orsay museum, and less often use ""je vais à Orsay"" (""I'm going to Orsay"") to say we are going to the museum, as Orsay is also a city in the suburbs of Paris and it can be sometimes confusing. So the full name ""le musée d'Orsay"" is used often."
"I for one am pleased that the ""bise"" (cheek kissing) is back more and more. Nobody gives a flying f--k about shaking hands, but kissing your friends and family is an essential part of French culture."
The bise is a wonderful way to spread the virus if we cannot suppress it. We have to forego many cultural norms if we want to overcome this. The American and UK attitude to this virus is palpable.
Here’s an interesting website. It has everything you need to know about crossing the borders in the EU:https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/FRA
"** The bise is a wonderful way to spread the virus if we cannot suppress it **That's profoundly true. The moratorium on ""bise"" is a responsible practice for now."

Versailles Palace is open. Standing in the Hall of Mirrors right now. All good.
"ATFIs it very busy. Strangely enough we were watching a programme about LouisIV last night and I said to my partner, now would be the time to visit."
ATF:Tell us about the garden party. Did you have fun?
"LOL, I actually went back for the second evening of the garden party..) Speaking of gardens... the fountains are about to begin. Hermione, my wife said the same thing about Versailles being crowded. They had started limiting the entrance after we got there just in time for the 1:30 palace entrance."
"After 17,000 steps of walking around the palace and gardens, 7 miles, ended up on rue de Satory at Le Baradoz for a craft beer. Versailles is open. Bring a mask for the interior.Waited 40 minutes to ""buy"" palace tickets where the French family behind me in line could have given me a back massage. So today was masks but zero social distancing. It's a toss.At least I didn't have to kiss them..)"
"Re 302: The reason for the difference is that the Louvre is a building—a palace—which houses a museum. Orsay is a place, a town, after which a museum is named. Thus it is correct to say le Louvre, referring to the building, and by extension to the museum within. But one must say le musée d'Orsay. Saying just the Orsay for the Orsay Museu is like saying just the Liberty for the Statue of Liberty. Far worse yet is ""D'Orsay,"" which corresponds to ""Of Liberty,"" and is a great enough error (combining both linguistic and cultural ignorance) to suggest that the speaker has never before ventured off the family farm at home."
"Yes, you're right. If anybody really wants to go to Orsay, the RER B goes there. If you want to go to ""the"" Orsay it's on RER C or else metro line 12 (Solférino)."
"** After 17,000 steps of walking around the palace and gardens, 7 miles, ended up on rue de Satory at Le Baradoz for a craft beer. **ATF: After 17000 steps you need a vacation and not a craft beer :-)"
"ATFHere in U.K. all attractions, museums etc are only letting people go in with pre booked slots, even the ones that are FOC to enter. They are able to control the numbers. We visited Kew Gardens last week and it was well organised. There were quite a lot of visitors, but as it’s a big space everybody was able to social distance very easily. They also had two places to enter and two different ones to leave. There were attendants at the toilets. It all worked very well."
"Any talk of any of the cabarets or other theatre shows re-opening (with limited numbers perhaps?)Here in the UK cinemas are opening early July.Edited: 10:12 am, June 29, 2020 "
"The cinemas already opened here (all over France) on June 22nd. Some theatres have opened already,, and I have a ticket for a play on July 13th."
"O'TACOS are open: https://o-tacos.com/en/Not to be confused for a Taco, the O'taco is basically a beef/chicken/veggie wrap filled with french fries and a cheese sauce compacted into a square shape sandwich.For food made by Mexicans I ate here in the 11th: https://www.cafechilangoparis.com/Google for more choices: 11 arrondissement mexican cuisineMy tacos were delicious."
"In Paris now and it's fairly quiet in the Châtelet Les Halles area. Masks to and from and in the metro stations, cafés none but sparsely populated. People walking around hard to say for the moment, I am near a dozen metro exits, maybe 40-60. Beautiful day here.Edited: 4:56 am, July 03, 2020 "
"I went to Montmartre and it was very quiet. Almost exclusively locals walking around as far as I could tell, perhaps profiting from the lack of crowds. But I don't think the merchants were too happy, with most tables empty. No lines, no waiting. And very few artists—three or four—on the place du Tertre, leaving empty space despite the encroachment of (largely empty) restaurant terraces. Still, for those of us who were there, it was calm and pleasant, and the weather was nice. Not deserted at all … but in comparison to the usual traffic, the difference was striking."
"I am looking forward to my visit to the Louvre when it reopens in a couple of days. I hope it will be fairly empty, because my covid anxiety has returned, watching the alarming spikes in the US."
"The museum at the Centre Pompidou was very quiet, more people at the Christo temporary exhibition. But outside this part of town around the Halles is busy."
"Interesting to hear that about les Halles, Pierre. I am still trying to avoid crowds, but the Pompidou is tempting."
Tonight's pizzeria was packed solid. No masks. No social distancing. Packed. Menus not disinfected. Wild. As if no one was watching the news. Pure Old Normal.
Summertime in Paris without the American tourist hoards sounds like a dream. Glad the locals are getting to enjoy their city in relative peace this year.
"Yes in the more upmarket parts of town, like between Le Louvre and Opera, the absence of American, Japanese and Chinese tourists is noticeable. Luxury shops, expensive restaurants and cafes are deserted."
"I'm enjoying my city without the international tourist hoards, too!"
"Although a few places are still closed, the handful of tourists who are actually here are surely enjoying their visits—Pars without crowds of tourists is likely to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.And watching the news is a bad idea, as it gives an extremely distorted—and invariably negative—perspective of reality."
"With regard to Post 326 ...I wonder if the French authorities have mentioned the possibility of ""local"" lockdowns, if there are spikes in the number of cases breaking out?Keep well allAnthony K"
"Well, yes, it can happen in any country. But I don't think the French government would decide that without an extremely solid reason"
"There already has been local lockdowns when the government earmarked certain areas of the country as green, orange, or red. Ile de France/Paris was the last area to be fully opened but nothing precludes future closures or restrictions.In my neighborhood on the Left Bank, people are generally taking the virus seriously. Virtually all retail requires a mask of each patron and shops limit the number of customers entering. Restaurants have moved outdoors as parking has been removed almost everywhere there is a restaurant, allowing for al fresco dining. Taxes on outdoor space have been suspended through the end of September so restaurants are taking advantage. Inside, tables are well separated and all servers wear masks.There are always business closures every year but this summer, there seems to be a very large number of recently vacated retail locations. Several cafés in my area did not reopen June 22nd and a number of hotels remain shuttered. Things typically stabilize in September after the summer vacation period, it will be interesting to see what business are open then."
"Google images for: la fête de la musique 2020 parisIt's been 2 weeks in France since that good time so according to mainstream news from April the whole country should be locked down by tomorrow. Remember what the mainstream told you, 1 person becomes 2 then 4 then 8, then a pandemic.Hasn't the WHO flipped flopped again, asymptomatic transmission is now rare since stating so in a June news briefing. 2 weeks is up since the music party, protests, riots, beach madness, concerts, and pizzerias..Anthony, did you get a comfortable mask yet? Tic toc"
"ATFMy Doctor has supplied me with a number of surgical masks that do not restrict my breathing, thank-you for asking. They are disposable rather than washable and reusable, so I hope he will continue to give me as many as I need.Keep wellAnthony K"
hello guys. i will go on Paris on September.. what do y think?? i will make the trip??
Re Post 336Yes. And I will be there as well.EnjoyAnthony K
"#336 : where are you from? No one can tell for sure at this point (but if you can't come, see Anthony K for refunds)."
The gentleman that I replied to comes from Greece. Part of the EU.CheersAnthony K
"Paris Plages is proposing something new this year on the Bassin de la Villette -- a floating cinema starting July 18. There will be 38 electric boats for groups of 2, 3 or 4 people directly on the water, and 150 chaises longues for people on the opposite bank. It is free of charge and can be reserved on the appropriate website. Häagen-Dazs will be providng treats for the spectators."
"With the big turn around fm WHO, maybe after all, yes!!! We shall see"
"#338 .Αs Anthony said , i am from Greece!!Edited: 8:56 am, July 07, 2020 "
"Αnthony i hope to enjoy our travel!!Best regards, Spyros"
"We are US citizens and have a 2 week trip booked for france the last week of September and first week of October- flying into Paris. The news here is that EU continues to ban US travel. For those of you in EU, is the feeling that US visitors will be admitted in the coming weeks or months (assuming COVID cases level or go down here) or is the ban on US travel pretty well accepted there and no calls for it to be lifted? I would think the tourism industry would be pushing for a lift sooner than later if cases level off here in the next couple of weeks, but I have no feel for how the general public would feel."
"Although the EU recommends right now to admit tourists from 15 countries, most EU countries up to now decided to ignore this recommendation and remain closed.One of the reason is the lack of reciprocity. Even through Japanese and Chinese tourists spend a lot in Europe.No-one knows the future, but since you're American ask yourself the question when will the US admit Europeans ? Maybe not before another US President takes office ?"
"The way we in the USA have mismanaged the response to COVID-19 and the continued failure to flatten the curve (especially when compared to the EU and other countries), it makes sense that we're not allowed into the EU right now. If I were an EU citizen I'd not wish to visit the US until we see better management of the virus here, or failing that, a vaccine. As someone who has taken 6-8 trips to the EU every year for the last 10 years, this saddens me to no end. We have already had multiple EU trips cancelled, but are optimistic that our October and December trips might be possible. We miss Paris."
"The idea that we can ""control"" or ""manage"" the pandemic with neither a vaccine nor an effective treatment is largely baseless. If anything done by anyone correlates with morbidity or mortality over the long term, it is fortuitous."
Photos of the Louvre on its reopening day: https:/…
"Was in Paris in the second week of July. The Louvre had reopened, Musee d'Orsay and most other attractions were open, as were most boutiques, cafes and restaurants. More tables outsides spilling over further onto sidewalks and streets (special permission given by the government). Many smaller streets were closed off to traffic, to enable tables to be set up for lunches, dinners, in a socially distanced way. Gave it a wonderful 'al fresco' dining experience - but within the city, even in a city like Paris. They restaurants and cafes put more effort into the decorations - such as fun large teddy bears at cafes - which was wonderfully playful and fun. Some special events like a night laser show at Invalides, or water fountain show in Versailles were just resuming as of the weekend of the 18th of July (for the former). Disneyland Paris reopend on the 15th of July. Indoor places were nicer to visit - as they had more limited entry for people - but you do need to be wearing a masks - which you get used to. Hand gels were everywhere, and at nicer cafes restaurants, they had that extra little detail in place - such as sanitized hand wipes, special 'pockets' for napkins and cutlery, etc. Definitely not as packed as you would expect in Paris, but more locals for that time of the year, and plenty of tourists - but not packed full. Hotels, especially the 5 star and Palace rated ones were not all open - and not due to open until next month for many. Face masks and hand gels were easy to find in the stores, but you should go with plenty. Best to book ahead of time online, keep tickets on your phone, take a mask, and have wipes to wipe your phone. Most things were due to reopen as of the weekend of theEdited: 6:38 am, July 21, 2020 "
UbbabeThanks for your fine review.Keep wellAnthony K
"Can we look at this issue and see if there is agreement on Exchange Rates?At this stage I am not wishing to discuss whether it is better to use a Debit Card, Credit Card or cash.From what was said, elsewhere, earlier, it seems that a better rate is available, for the purchase of Euros, in France than it is in the UK.Today, online, the best I was offered for an exchange of £500 was 543E. With no fees. Just above 1:1.08.Is that reasonable or will any Paris ATM or Bank give me a better rate?Thank-youAnthony"
"“ Is that reasonable or will any Paris ATM or Bank give me a better rate?”Unless you have an account with a bank in Paris, you will not be able to exchange funds at a bank. They only deal with their own clients. You can’t walk in off the street and expect to transact any kind of business. The only walk-up exchange you’re going to get in Paris is at a currency exchange booth. Unless you wish to revisit withdrawing cash with your bank debit card at an ATM.Edited: 11:29 am, August 02, 2020 "
"AnnetteThanks for that. Perhaps I am too au fait with Egyptian Banks who are far more pleasant in their attitude. Also their ATMs are fantastic.So it's a Lloyds Debit Card in an ATM, and a charge of £2.99 on a withdrawal of £100. Probably makes waiting until I reach Paris unnecessary.C'est la vieAnthony K"
"So, on this issue, finally, what is the current rate given by Paris ATMs when using Bank Cards, to buy Euros ... excluding any fees and charges?CheersAnthony KEdited: 12:05 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"1.08 is not a bad rate, but I'm sure you know that there can be further fluctuations between now and your arrival in September. It's always a gamble."
"k2Thanks again. I'll probably use the Internet and get enough Euros to cover my intended trips to both Paris and Sitges/Barcelona. If I'm lucky, within the next couple of weeks, perhaps I'll get 1:1.10 As for fluctuations, I have gotten prematurely grey hair for a number of reasons and monetary fluctuations is just one of them.I had an occasion, some years ago, when over a seven week period I travelled from London to New York, New York to Paris, Paris to Prague and Prague to Barcelona before returning home. It was before the coming of the Euro and thus involved the use of five different currencies for small purchases, such as tips and cab fares.That's lifeAnthony K"
"If you use your debit card in a foreign ATM, the exchange rate is set by your bank, not the bank whose ATM you use, wherever you are. If you use your credit card to draw cash then AFAIK most card providers charge extra for cash advances, wherever you are."
"You are right. My Bank will charge me 2.99% on the amount of currency I buy, with my Debit Card, in France. That will be the only charge.If I use my Credit card it will only be to pay following a Medical Emergency or for a major purchase. CheersAnthony K"
I find cards that do not charge for use abroad the best to use. I have different cards for travel with this feature. I get very near bank rate.
