"Thank you bigsnitch for your very kind words. And I must say it wouldn't have been possible without the help of the 2 people I have mentioned in the post.Now the main thing about this post/topic is that I have made this after consulting TA and they have agreed to put it on top of the forum as a ""sticky"". I have also asked if they can do it in a way that additions/updates and comments can be added like in a thread."
Great post Nicksy & thanks to Yiassis & Absolutely Athens too
Thank you Nicksy for taking the trouble to post in such detail.
So you managed to get the thread ready for tonight. What to say - Well done! guys and girls. ;)Congratulations!
"Nice one Nicksy, as us Mancunians would say. Along with Yiassas and Absolutely Athens as well of course. Stay safe everyone, in a few years this will be a distant nightmare..."
"Bump ....Is there any way TA can keep this thread at the top of the page so everyone looking for info can see it immediately. Itlay Forum has done this successfully and it's the go-to post during this stressful time.Even though I don't post here often, I am always, always reading. A big THANK YOU to Nicksy, Yiassas, Absolutely Athens and many other regulars for all their knowledge and contributions.We are all keen to reinvest time, travel, money and love when the time it right. Stay safe and take care everyone xx"
"Thanks, Nicksy !!"
Thanks Nicksy et al.A great post helpful and informative as always
And to be fair: The idea was not mine but it came from @Jackie B who reached to me and asked if it would be possible.Now we are awaiting for TA staff to pin it at the top of the forum.
Forgot to add this link to a map where you can see the number of cases in Greece and the spread. The map is updated every evening (I think around 6 or 7pm):https://tinyurl.com/s6232ab
#15. Thanks for the link Nicksy. So good to see no cases of coronavirus whatsoever on some of the islands. Am sure the Greek government’s strict measures will go a long way towards keeping it like that.

"Odd to see that the second largest outbreak in Greece is in Pyrgos. It's a fairly insignificant town, apart from being reasonably close to Olympia. I know they lit the Olympic flame there a couple of weeks ago, but I read that they had excluded spectators."
"JBMED, that was one of the first significant outbreaks in Greece. It came after a group of people returned from a pilgrimage trip to Egypt and Israël. The group consisted of people from mainly the Pyrgos area but also people from Patras and Zakynthos (hence the 5 five positive cases on Zakynthos)."

"Impact of the restrictions on the ferry passenger figures AND the ferry companies:- Indicative figures released from the Association of Passenger Shipping Companies (23.03.2020) shows that passenger traffic for the period 16-22/3, had a major decrease of 77,33%, compared with 2019.- In fact, the reduction in passenger traffic - in the last few days- is expected to be even higher after the restrictive measures were taken on March 21 by the Ministry of Shipping.- Moreover, the Hellenic Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy has already been informed about the failure of some ferry operators to return prepaid fares that were already booked for the Easter and the summer season.Fortunately, their only ally –so far- against this severe crisis is the oil prices which have fallen by about 60% (25,9$) since the beginning of the year, otherwise the majority of them would have been forced to halt sailings and laid up their ferries."

"Flights from/to Holland and to/from Germany with the exception of Athens will be suspended as of Sunday, March 29, 2020, according the head of Greece’s Civil Protection Nikos Hardalias.Two “imported” cases on the islands of Ikaria and Kefalonia were recorded on Saturday.A 25-year-old who returned from UK violated the house isolation and travel to Ikaria, thus becoming the first confirmed case on the island. He visited the locla hospital, has mild symptoms and returned to isolation.A 31-year-old man who recently traveled by car and ferry boat from Sweden to Kefalonia is the first confirmed coronavirus case on the island in the Ionian Sea.Worth noting that the village of Echinos by Xanthi, in north-eastern Greece, was placed in quarantine on Friday after one man died and several residents were tested positive on COVID-19. Cause for the outbreak in the 3,000-people village was the massive return of Greeks working in Sweden and Germany. They left the countries in order to be with their families and brought the virus with. And they came by car."
"Imported cases? An incredible irresponsibility!Thus, Italians originally from the south, fleeing the corona from North killed their elderly, relatives and neighbors."
"Just a short reminder and some new things that were decided after the start of this topic have been added too.Greece has imposed a total ban on public movement to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. Exempted from the ban are people going to and from work, state officials, security and medical personnel and staff from civil protection, health services, security forces and the armed forces. All other citizens planning to leave the house to visit a pharmacy, doctor, bank or food store, to walk their pet or go for a brief walk or run for the purpose of exercise have to complete a form or send a text message to the Civil Protection Ministry explaining their reason. Offenders face a fine of at least 150€ if stopped by the police. The fine can go up to 5.000€.Greek Minister of Development and Investment, Adonis Georgiadis announced yesterday that the lockdown will last “way beyond” April 6th, the original end-date envisaged when the lockdown was applied. A date will be set later.AIR TRAFFICSuspended: ALL flights to non-EU countries. And also all flights to/from Turkey, Spain, Italy, UK, Holland and Germany.An exception are flights from Germany to/from Athens. In accordance with EU-wide restrictions, all visitors arriving by plane from EU countries are required to self-isolate for 14 days.- Aegean Airlines have, for the moment, suspended all international flights up till 30 April with the exception of a few flights to/from Brussels. All information about cancellations, rebooking and suspended flights is available on the Aegean Airlines website. https://en.aegeanair.com/aegean-announcement/For cancellations, rebooking and suspended OLYMPIC AIR domestic flights, the same applies as for Aegean Airlines flights. https://www.olympicair.com/enFor domestic flights with Sky Express: https:/…Domestic flights are under the same restrictions as ferry traffic.FERRY TRAFFICNote that all ferry traffic to/from the islands is limited to:- Permanent island residents with the exception of persons needed to be on the islands in their official or job related business (military, medical and educational staff).

Currently these restrictions are till 6AM on 21 April.HOTELS AND SEASONAL ACCOMMODATIONAs ordered by the government ALL hotels and seasonal accommodation are closed for the moment till 30 April. A list has been made up which hotels are ALLOWED BY THE GOVERNMENT to stay open. These hotels are NOT open for tourists and visitors. They are used for instance for the 14 day isolation of groups (Greeks) that are repatriaded.STAY AT HOME TO KEEP GREECE AND THE ISLANDS SAFE."
"Prime minister Mitsotakis today said he ""hopes"" to relief some of the lockdown measures from the 10th of May. And if so, it will happen gradually in 3 phases:1. ending of movement restrictions for the locals2. reopening of schools, shops and restaurants3. restoration of domestic and foreign air transportThe precondition for this to occur is the confirmation of estimates of a letup in the momentum of the virus over Easter and that, until that time, the safety guidelines and restrictions be strictly observed by the public.Only time will tell if it's a realistic thought or wishfull thinking."
"Dear fellow TA members,we all do realize that the situation is horrible at the moment. Also, we all know that we have to be careful and follow all the rules which minimize the spreading of the virus. Moreover, it is absolutely true that we have to avoid booking flights and accommodations until the situation becomes more predictable.However, we shouldn't be too pessimistic. One of the professors at the University of Ljubljana managed to make a very good logistic model which predicts the number of infections with almost unbelievable accuracy (on most of the days he misses the real number of infections by less than a percent). The model is of course different from country to country and it heavily depends on people behaving according to the rules posed by the governments. In most EU countries the model predicts that the number of new infections will fall to almost zero by April 20th. There are some exceptions, for example in France this limit will be reached by May 10th. The model also works for example for Iran and predicts the end of the epidemics by the end of June.Therefore, although we cannot be certain, the situation is very likely to normalize before July. And maybe, even our beloved Greece may become accessible this summer. I booked a flight to Greece in the middle of July and I am keeping my fingers crossed."
"This week supplementary rules were announced. These apply to all modes of public mass transport, including city buses, trolleybuses, trams, passenger trains, rapid transit (metro) and ferries through to 30 May 2020. According to the measures, the permissible transport capacity has been set at 50 percent of the total.Other regulations allow one passenger per vehicle (taxi cabs or private use cars) of up to five seats, allowing a second passenger only in cases of transport for medical purposes such as transfer to a hospital or medical center.Two passengers are allowed in public or private vehicles with six or seven seats, and three in eight or nine-seater vehicles. An additional person is allowed in cases of parents accompanying minors."

"I think policing any new holiday arrivals could prove really difficult for Greece in the event that flights from only certain countries are allowed to land.

As Mitsotakis said a few days ago: ""We will go back to normal but in graduations or different phases"". And this is something I believe (even if it's something said by a politician).

"UPDATE:Greece’s Tourism Ministry is planning the issue of a 18-month voucher i order to support hotels and travel agencies hit by the coronavirus crisis. The Ministry will introduce a relevant regulation that will offer the opportunity for tourist businesses to compensate their clients.According to the plan, customers who have made a booking, for example, during the Easter break, will not receive a cash refund but compensation in the form of a voucher of equal value, lasting for 18 months. The customers will be able to use the voucher for another trip at a later date, possibly even to a different destination, via the same travel agent or the same tourist enterprise.Hotel owners in Greece have recently told media, that they are unable to pay compensations due to the current economic situation and becaused the prepayment money has been used for investment for the touristic season.The tourism ministry is also preparing a letter to the European Commission to request support of the measures.Source: https:/…"

Thoughts on odds of likelihood of being able to traveling to Greece from New York in late August - early September?
"Greece’s Civil Protection announced on Wednesday a series of stringent controls at the main exits of Athens and other cities and suspended inter-island travel with a few exceptions. In an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus, authorities will intensify lockdown checks at highways and toll stations, ports and airports, trains and long-distance bus stations to hinder a mass exodus over the Easter holidays.Permanent residents will be allowed to move once and remain in their permanent residence for as long as the lockdown measures are valid.The measures go into effect at 06:00 p.m. Wednesday, April 8, 2020, head of Civil protection Nikos Hardalias said during the daily briefing.All measures will be in effect to April 27, until further notice, and will be enforced on a 24-hour basis, he stressed.No inter-islands travel: exceptionsIslanders especially residents of small islands will be allowed to move to islands of the same municipality and only for health & pharmacy reasons (B1), for purchasing supplies in supermarkets (B2) or go to the bank if online service not possible (B3).Example: Residents of Symi will be allowed to travel to Rhodes for reasons B1, B2 and B3, residents of Rhodes will not be allowed to travel to Symi."

"Agree with the Ekathimerini article, there may be a small select tourist season however they need to tread very carefully.Strange that one of the countries that the article lists as being a safe place of origin for tourists is Israel, as they have done an abysmal job in containing the virus. In fact one of the main reasons the numbers jumped some weeks back in Greece was people returning from a pilgrimage from Israel.Personally feel June is too early, however late July with strict criteria may be an option if things continue to improveEdited: 12:35 am, April 13, 2020 "

Would be nice to think we could all sample the delights of Greece again this summer but I really do have my doubts about Package type air travel returning this summer.. Genuinely hope I’m wrong...B.
">>You think domestic flights will commence by June?<<The government’s plan for a return to normality starting on May 10 will be implemented gradually and in phases on the condition that the coronavirus curve continues to flatten. The lifting of the measures could even be completed by as early as July if things go as planned and there is no resurgence of the virus.The model developed by the government in collaboration with experts not only provides that existing restrictions will not be terminated at the same time, but also that their removal will not be “horizontal.” In particular, the abolition of restrictions of movement, which is expected to be the starting point, will not affect everyone in the initial phase.Moreover, the bans on large social gatherings, including the operation of businesses such as bars and cafes, will remain in place during the early phase. Also, the lifting of movement restrictions will initially concern urban centers.The travel restrictions will be lifted after mid-June or early July, so that there will be a gradual return to normal on the tourism front as well.https://www.ekathimerini.com/251614/article/…"
"Thank you, Nicksy and 123twinkletoes. Yes, I was especially keen on domestic flights as they are less likely to get cancelled than the international ones. I have a domestic flight booking at Olympic Air. However, the departure time got preponed by 5 mins which means that I get the usual '15070' error that doesn't allow me to make free modifications (mine is Flexi fare allowing me unlimited changes) online. Calling Aegean will require hours on hold + will cost me more than the cancellation fee itself. Email reply from them says they need 45-60 days to get back to me. Hence, cancellation by the airline will work best as it provides me a voucher with 18 months' validity. Anyway, I will ask more on this in a separate thread. Don't want to clutter this thread. Thank you for your help."

"Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this thread so far.Does anyone have a sense on when the yachting ban to the island will be lifted and/or extended? I believe the current end date is late April. We have a boat booked on May 16th. Obviously, I am 99.99% convinced the ban will not be lifted prior to that. However, our charter is demanding that we either pay the balance of our charter fee within 30 days (April 16) or else we need to sign an addendum to reschedule. We have 10 people in our group and we are not interested in committing to a new date at this point. We want a full refund, and the terms of our contract say that that if the owner can't deliver the boat on May 16th we are entitled to a full refund.The boat owner is telling us that they will have the boat ready to go on the 16th. I know this is complete nonsense, but unless we pay the balance of our charter fee on 04/16 it appears that there will be no other remedy for getting a refund."
"Hi13/04/20 covid19 daily updateToday the briefing was presented by Mr. Tsiodras, Mr Hardalias and other members of the committee responsible for the covid 19.The situation looks stabilised, we have performed 44.000 molecular tests and we have 31 new cases confirmed and all together 2145 cases, 73 ICU intubated and 99 deaths.In Crete 17 cases have been reported until now 1 death (the German scientist) and the lady from cruise ship who is now out from the ICU.All others cases are at home in personal carandine.The situation is under control and it goes as predicted. There will be clinical tests on patients with plasma from already recovered patients. The results will determine if it will be used for the general population.There are already talks about restrictions to be eased by beginning of May gradually every 15 days so that by the end of June hopefully the restrictions will only remain for the older members of society."
"#104. Hi Todd. Just to be clear on this, where is the charter company registered and where exactly do you connect with the boat?"
Thanks Dimitris. My wife and I have a 25th anniversary trip planned to Crete (Heraklion and Platanias) June 22nd. Fingers and toes crossed.
"Todd Salvatore - I agree that the possibility of you charter being fulfilled is unlikely but nevertheless it exists. My worry would be that if I paid the balance, I might not get it back and I am in the same position as you with regard to two bookings of holiday cottages in the UK in June. I am waiting for the property owners to approach me to pay the balance at which time I propose to promise payment as soon as lockdown is lifted and the properties are definitely available for my use.There is no way on earth that the charter company can guarantee your booking at present. The Greek government is determined to prevent the virus reaching the islands and they won’t be taking any chances on that.Edited: 9:55 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Government spokesman Stelios Petsas announced that the gradually lifting of lockdown restrictions may start in the first days of May and may be completed by mid-June, if the course of the coronavirus pandemic continues in the same modus, the virus curve flattens and there is no resurgence of the pandemic in the country.Small retail stores could also open in the first phase but criteria will have to be followed like in supermarkets under the lockdown, so to hinder crowding.Bars, cafes and restaurants could open in the second phase sometime in June, with tables outside and in a safety distance to each other.Travel restrictions could be lifted after mid-June or in early July.He added that “there will be timely information about which sectors will open first, what will happen to schools and tourism.”"
"The regulation allowing Greek airlines, ferries and tourism enterprises (hotels and travel agencies) to reimburse customers with 18-month vouchers for bookings that were canceled due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, instead of cash refunds, was published in the Government Gazette on Monday.Airline ticketsThe 18-month voucher for airline tickets concerns flights that were booked in advance on Greek airlines and then cancelled between 25 February 2020 and 30 September 2020.In a time period of 18 months, customers at any time may use their vouchers towards any destination of the network of the airline they had originally booked a trip with.Ferry ticketsThe 18-month voucher concerns domestic and international ferry tickets that were booked on Greek coastal ferries. It concerns cancellations for the period from 25 February 2020 until 31 October 2020.Vouchers for ferry travel will be issued for customers who cannot travel due to restrictions; do not wish to travel due to uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic; or due to cancellation – under Greek or EU law – of scheduled routes.In a time period of 18 months, customers may at any time use their vouchers for any destination of the network of the coastal shipping company that had originally made the booking with. All vouchers will be equal to the price of tickets that were originally booked for trips that were canceled.Hotel, travel agency bookingsThe 18-month voucher concerns individual bookings or reservations for package travel. It concerns cancellations that have been made by either the tourism enterprise or the customer of any nationality due to the Covid-19 pandemic, during the period from February 25 2020 until 30 September 2020.Tourism enterprises are obliged to inform customers of their vouchers within 30 days from the date their booking was cancelled. If enterprises do not inform their customers in 30 days then the vouchers for canceled bookings are considered void and replaced with cash refunds.The value of each voucher must be equal to the amount paid by the customer in advance when making the booking. The tourism enterprise is obliged to offer the customer the possibility to use the voucher for the provision of the same service or similar to the one that was originally paid for.If the total value of the service chosen by the customer is less than the value of the voucher, the customer may choose to either receive a new voucher for the amount corresponding to the difference in value, with a duration to be agreed between the parties, or receive the difference in cash when the original voucher expires.On the other hand, if the total value of the service chosen by the customer exceeds the value of the voucher, the difference is paid by the customer to the tourism enterprise.However, it is noted clearly that if the vouchers are not used within 18 months by customers, businesses will be required to refund the initial amount of the bookings in cash.Courtesy of GTP Newletter 14 april: https://tinyurl.com/thv2ev2Edited: 8:59 am, April 14, 2020 "
"Hi 123twinkletoes - the charter is through IYBA (International Yacht Brokers Association) and is due to leave from Athens on May 16th. Our contract says we are owed a full refund if the owner cannot deliver the boat through reasons of force majeure within 24 hours of our scheduled sailing time.Ironically, they claim that we as the Charterers are not protected by force majeure. So, if the boat is ready on May 16th and we for some reason cannot physically get to Athens, we would forfeit the entire charter fee. We absolutely want to do this sailing at some point in time. But the position that the charter company has taken with us has left a really bad taste in my mouth. I would feel a lot better if they would have just refund our money and kindly asked us to rebook at a later date of our choosing, instead of trying to BS us and push us into a corner.Edited: 7:51 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Todd, Most tourism companies are offering vouchers, not refunds, usually to be redeemed over the next 18 months, in line with Greek gov'ts guidelines.As an example of what is currently in place - 3 people in Crete yesterday, 1 of whom is rumoured to be the vice-mayor of Georgioupolis, a holiday resort in West Crete, were each fined E5,000 yesterday when caught at sea in a boat."
">Ironically, they claim that we as the Charterers are not protected by force majeure. So, if the boat is ready on May 16th and we for some reason cannot physically get to Athens, we would forfeit the entire charter fee.<Absolutely correct. All they have to do is make the yacht available to you. If you can’t get there, it isn’t their problem."
"Hi Todd. The situation you have described was my great concern, i.e., that the yacht would be in place ready for use...but you and your party couldn’t get to it, leaving you liable. I can understand your distaste at the lack of flexibility being shown. You might already have gathered from the forum that obtaining refunds is a big issue right now and it seems vouchers are being issued in many cases, as opposed to cash. Sadly, I have no helpful advice to give, you clearly understand your limited options, upsetting as they are.I wish you good luck Todd with sorting all of this. Keep safe and well.Edited: 11:29 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Thanks, Nicksy, for the very helpful updates! Does anyone know if the voucher system overrides the normal cancellation policies of hotels, ferries, flights, etc.? We have a family trip to Crete planned for mid June. I'm fairly sure it will not happen, and starting to look into cancelling. I have hotel rooms booked in Paleochora that at least previously allows cancellation with full refund up to 2 weeks before the arrival date. I also purchased ferry tickets on Anek Lines which in the Terms and Conditions allows cancellation without penalty up to 24 hours before departure. Does the new voucher proclamation override these cancellation policies?Thanks!"
"Thanks everyone. We have been holding out hope that the country would simply extend the sailing ban to the islands until at least the end of May, which seems almost inevitable at this point. We would then have assurances that the yacht owner would be unable to ""deliver"" the boat as promised on May 16th and could be entitled to a refund. That option appears to be fading, as we now have 48 hours to cancel and reschedule. I saw the measure that was released yesterday regarding 18-month vouchers. I don't know if that would apply to private yacht rentals, but I should point out that the new directive clearly states that if the voucher is not used within 18 months, then the traveler would be subject to a full refund in cash. Good luck everyone. Hope to visit this amazing country soon."
"#115: The idea behind the Greek voucher plan is in my opinion this: In a lot of cases personel still has to be paid, other costs are still there but there is no income. If everybody is given a full refund now, its absolutely certain that (some) companies will collapse. To prevent that the government came up with this voucher system. But it still says in the decision of the government that in the occassion the voucher is not/can not be used within 18 months, a full refund has to be made."
"With or without vouchers, ufortunately there will be companies going bust. Right now there are major airlines on the brink of collapse without intervention. It's a case of buyer beware, if you pay a deposit there is no guarantee of it being returned."
"UPDATEWith a joint ministerial decision, Greece has extended the restrictive measures – travel ban – concerning air and sea traffic from abroad on Wednesday. According to the decision by the Health and Interior Ministry and the Civil Protection that will be published in the Official Gazette during the day:Flights to/from Turkey, UK, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Germany remain banned until 03:00 p.m. May 15. 2020. Flights from/to Germany are allowed only to the International Airport in Athens.Third-country nationals will not be allowed to enter Greece until May 18. 2020.European Union nationals and according to Schengen Agreement are not affected by the bans."
"Hi15/04/20 covid19 daily updateToday the briefing was presented by Mr. Tsiodras, Mr Hardalias and other members of the committee responsible for the covid 19.The situation looks stabilised, we have performed 50771 molecular tests and we have 22 new cases confirmed and all together 2192 cases, 72 ICU intubated and 1 new death and all together 102 deaths.The situation is under control and it goes as predicted.They, once again, explained how important it is to stay at home and forbade the travels of the population to the villages and islands during the Easter period especially on Holy Friday and Holy Saturday. They also explained how important it is not to invite relatives or family members over for food and celebrations on Easter Sunday or the day after.Possibly after few days after the Greek Orthodox Easter they will be ready to announce the new meassures for after the 27 April."
Just came across this post and many thanks for putting such a comprehensive post together as all information is gratefully received particularly during this very sad and disruptive time. Keep up the good work and keep safe.
"We are schedule to leave the US and travel to Athens, Santorini and Rhodes June 4 Thus far hotels will not refund or move dates. Aegean airlines you can only move flights to end of March. Appears Greece wants to restart tourism season July 1. Any suggestions on how to cancel trip and be refunded or at the very least postpone for a year"
"Hello james, Here is a link with the details on what the Greek government has advised tourism business's to do regarding refund/cancellations. I hope it helps and I also hope that your trip can go ahead as planned in a safe manner.https://news.gtp.gr/2020/04/14/covid-19-greece-covers-canceled-bookings-vouchers-instead-refunds/?utm_source=GTP+headlines+list&utm_campaign=dd918b39dd-Headlines+Newsletter+14-4-2020&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_742e571d31-dd918b39dd-65001049"
"Ciao Katerina,thank you for this link.My question is: government is talking about cancelled flight.My flight, scheduled with Aegean Airlines in July (Flex fare ticket) has not been canceled. Flex fare is a reimbursamble ticket in case i want to cancel it calling the call center. Do you think i will get the voucher instead?Thank you!"
Greece is to extend the travel ban on flights from some countries until May 15th.https:/…
"Francisco,This is what was published in the Greek Government Gazette on Monday:Airline ticketsThe 18-month voucher for airline tickets concerns flights that were booked in advance on Greek airlines and then cancelled between 25 February 2020 and 30 September 2020.In a time period of 18 months, customers at any time may use their vouchers towards any destination of the network of the airline they had originally booked a trip with.And this regards all vouchers (airline, ferry, hotels,..)""If the vouchers are not used within 18 months by customers, businesses will be required to refund the initial amount of the bookings in cash."""
"So, EU261 not applicable anymore? I am ok with money being blocked for 18 months provided the voucher is backed by some government agency. If the bankruptcy risk is removed then basically it's just an extension of timeline for refund under EU261 from 7 days to 18 days months."
"Hello Francisco,I see what you mean. With your flight ticket being booked as a flexi fare it might fall under different criteria. I think the only definitive answer you will get will be from Agean themselves. The perfect scenario would be that you do not need to cancel and you can still make your trip safely. Regards"
Any official information as to an extension on hotel closures from April 27? Would have thought it would have been announced by now but I may have missed it? Thanks
"No, decisions are expected on 27th of April. Btw, the hotel closures for the moment are till the 30th of April.After the 27th, the next evaluation will be on the 4th of May."
Appreciate that Nicksy. You are doing a great job!
The European commission have released a statement regarding the voucher system that Greece and other EU member states plan to use. The voucher system works on the idea that if you have paid for a holiday or travel that has been affected by the pandemic you will be given a voucher that can be used within the next 18 months. If the voucher can not be used within the 18 months a refund could be given. As the article says they are not against this but there must be certain conditions that safe guard the consumer. Below is the link if anyone wishes to read it. https:/…
I would also like to post these articles as it is something positive regarding the situation in Greece. It has been well documented all over the world how well the Greek government and citizens have combated the spread of the corona virus. These articles will explain what the government did differently and the positive affects it will hopefully have on our future tourism industry. It is important to look for positives in a difficult situation. https:/…https:/…https:/…
Wow - this is a comprehensive resource! Thank you for posting! Will you be posting any updates? We were supposed to travel to Rhodes for June 1 but our flight has been cancelled. Not sure when to reschedule for. Need to coordinate with the owner of the house we have a deposit on . . . Any suggestions?
Thank you for your information. Your information is very helpful.
I just received notification from Aegean Airlines that I can change my tickets for travel for a future date of 01/09/20 to 27/03/2021. I do not know if and when we will be traveling to Greece now so how do I obtain a refund.? Of course where I click on learn more it gives me an error code
Even though Greece is in a better situation than most there is still no definitive answer to when the hotels and airports will be fully operational. Currently quarantine rules are set to change for locals as of the 27th of April. Below is a link explaining the current information regarding flights but it may change depending on the situation. The best thing is to keep checking on here and other news sources for official government information. We hope that you plans can still go ahead.https:/…
"@James WFor canceled flights you will get a mail from Aegean or Olympic Air (depending with whom you booked). For instance I got a mail this afternoon from Olympic Air that my flight from Athens to Skiathos on 13 May has been cancelled.In the mail they also explain what to do. There seem to be 2 options: Postpone (and rebook at a later date) or cancel and apply for a voucher. As I'm not planning to book any other flights with either Aegean or Olympic this year (End of last year I have already booked flights for after the summer), I have applied for the voucher. This voucher is valid for 18 months from the date of issue on any Aegean and Olympic route.The Greek government stipulated last week that vouchers from the airlines, ferry's, hotels and Greek touroperators have to be valid for 18 months. If you are not using these vouchers within that period, you should get a full refund in cash. .Edited: 12:41 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"Today Greece’s Minister of Tourism Harry Theocharis said that Greek authorities are considering the introduction of a ”Health Passport” which will serve as proof that an individual is not suffering from the COVID-19 coronavirus.Minister Theocharis said that there is an ongoing discussion at the European Union level to determine the ways in which EU citizens will be allowed to go on vacations this year.Brussels’ aim is to provide a credible test for every individual who wishes to go on summer holidays anywhere in Europe.This test will have to be conducted by the member-state of origin of the traveler, before he or she boards an airplane or any other means of transport.It is still unclear at this point whether non-EU nationals will be allowed to visit the country at all this summer or not.https:/…https:/…"
"James...from what Nicksy has said, it seems like the offer a refund is not applicable at the minute. It would only be due if your flight had been cancelled, which it hasn’t yet (I believe). Sounds like you are just being given an opportunity to reschedule your flight to another date, hence an expiry of 27 March 2021.Might be a case of having to wait for your flight to actually be cancelled before you are given an opportunity to receive a voucher that’s valid for a longer period, i.e. 18 months, with the promise of a refund at the end of that period if not used.Good luck with sorting it all out!!Edited: 2:16 pm, April 21, 2020 "
#139. An interesting development. Thanks for posting Nicksy.
#139 thanks for the info nicksy interesting reading
Hi thank you so much for the information. Im scheduled to fly to Greece from NY June 18th. My airline is offering me to reschedule out to 18 months. However they ask that this be done by April 30th. If I contact the hotels I already have booked will they also give me 18 month vouchers to reschedule my trip? Or is it only applicable if the flight is completely canceled. Many thanks
"#144. Hi. Current information is that there will be a short 2020 holiday season starting from July, and it is likely that not all hotels will open even then. If the above plan comes to fruition and your hotels do not open until July, I would have thought, as you were meant to stay in June, you’d be entitled to a refund of any money paid up front because your bookings cannot be fulfilled.In the current climate, I would ask for a refund because a voucher or transfer to a future date could prove to be worthless. It looks like visitors from the US, along with the UK, will be amongst the very last allowed into Greece, if at all this year. You’ll always be able to find alternative accommodation nearer the time you do eventually get to travel.Good luck with your rescheduling."
"The government is working on a plan to ease some of the restrictions that have been introduced to curb the spread of the coronavirus.According government spokesman Stelios Petsas, the government is keen to introduce a gradual return to normality while shielding public health and the economy. However, measures will remain in place for the general public until at least April 27. After that date, small shops are expected to be permitted to open. It remains unclear, however, what will happen with schools, though the fact that children are less susceptible to the virus is a consideration.In any case, Petsas said, the return to normality will be “a gradual, long and targeted process to ensure there is no backsliding.”Prime Minister Mitsotakis is expected to set out a roadmap for easing restrictions in a televised speech to the nation early next week.150 of the 156 new cases are from a hotel in Kranidi (Between Nafplio and Ermioni in the Argolis region on the Peloponnese). The hotel is used as a temporary reception center in the context of a program of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Of the positive cases, 148 are asylum seekers, one is a hotel employee and the other an aid worker."
"Can't say the same good news in the US since a number of southern states (Pro-Trump) will be opening up businesses like beauty salons, bowling alleys, beaches, gyms, etc. to the public. These are some of the worst places to open up as most people tend to congregate or need to be close to each other.Because of Trump and his ""clan"" many travelers from the US may not be allowed into Greece this year, including me.Another reason to get rid of the Fool in the White House!"
#148. I hope they all stay safe Yiassas.
"Hello Yiassas, Thank you for the informative updates. As you predicted they are expected to do the same for the May holidays as they did for Easter. I find the Greek travel pages to be very informative. Also Agrophilia have done an interesting and first survey on the impacts of Covod-19 on the tourism industry. Please see the link below. I am very impressed with the way the government is implementing strict quarantine rules but also looking to the future as to how we can come out of this as a people and economically. https:/…https:/…"
They’ll be playing it by ear I think Danny. Certainly an extension into October looks likely. Whether we’ll be travelling there is another matter altogether.
Yes I agree it’s the flights and the close proximity to so many other people that puts me off flying at the moment think it’s a game of wait and see
Danny....take a look at this thread to see some of the challenges that lie ahead....https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…
Greece is extending its lockdown for a couple more days until the 4th of May. I presume it's to cover the popular 1st of May holiday which is common sense. During this period many Greeks travel to their villages and interact on a large scale. https:/…
"Hello everyone,My friends and family and I have a trip planned for this August for my wedding which was to take place in Messinia. Unfortunately, I canceled the wedding due to the uncertainty of the situation. We would be coming from Canada.Does the voucher system apply to all International travelers or just EU travelers? Also, what is everyone's predictions about travel bans being lifted for all International travelers? At this point, I am hoping for a travel ban for non EU countries so that we may recoup some of our money.Thank - you for your time. this forum is so helpful!Joulia"
"Hello Joulia and welcome to the forum.Very sorry to hear you have to cancel the wedding.The voucher system is for ALL travelers. Regarding the travel ban, my personal opinion is that the lift of the travel ban for international travelers will be in the later stages. Restrictions and bans will be lifted gradually as already announced by the Greek government.That means amongst other things:1. Lifting or reducing the travel ban for domestic trips for the local inhabitants. Ref. the travel within the mainland and to the islands. 2. Lifting or reducing the travel ban within the EU countries (maybe even there with some restrictions for some countries)3. Lifting or reducing the travel ban for international/non-EU countries. Again with maybe restrictions on certain countries."
"Brilliant work there Nicksy.We are due to fly from Britain to Preveza for a booked villa holiday in Lefkada on 30 August and are so looking forward to it. But clearly there might be various obstacles to that not least by our own Government. If we can travel (and Greece will let us in) we will have no hesitation in coming. Greece after all, would appear to have the lowest number of cases in Europe so must be doing something right. And the tourism industry could certainly do with the income.Fingers crossed here."
">>Greece after all, would appear to have the lowest number of cases in Europe so must be doing something right.<<Well Boronet, I believe they were amongst the first countries in applying (very) strict rules and regulations regarding a lockdown. That is something that has absolutely helped to keep the infection numbers down. Unlike (many) other countries, they didn't look at it from the start as an ""ordinary kind of of flu""."
"It seems that there are problems in tracing contacts of the affected migrants in Kranidi. Putting it as delicately as I can, the locals have been in very close contact with them."
"This is an UNOFFICIAL schedule of the lifting of restrictions according government spokesman Stelios Petsas.4 May- the obligation of Movement Permits, that is to send SMS or to have handwritten form. However, the free movement for the elderly and vulnerable groups can be permitted later and not immediately.- opening of small stores, hairdressers and beauty salons20 May- Opening of big shopping malls Between 25 May and 5 June- POSSIBLE Reopening of cafes, bars and restaurants15 June- POSSIBLE reopening of hotels operating all through the year1 July- POSSIBLE reopening of seasonal hotels and tourists accommodation facilitiesThe spokesman added: “Following the success of the plan shown in the case and victim diagrams compared to other EU countries with a corresponding population,” the Prime Minister will announce the gradual lifting of the restrictions beginning of next week, April 27 or 28.As mentioned above: this schedule of the gradual lifting of the lockdown restrictions is NOT OFFICIAL and one has to wait for the official announcements by the Prime Minister.Source: https:/…Edited: 1:00 pm, April 23, 2020 "
Thank you for the kind words Nicksy and for your detailed response. I appreciate your efforts during these uncertain times.
"Thank you for the update....but i really hope this isn't the schedule. I fear for Greece if tourists are able to come as soon as that. I love the country and have gone there every year since 1988. The virus in this country UK is not under control yet at all, and as a key worker I see people ignoring the lockdown rules on a daily basis. I have read how well the Greeks have contained the virus and would hate to see all that hard work destroyed. I love Greece and can't wait to return but please don't rush things for the sake of a season. Greece has put the health of its nation at the forefront of their actions whilst the UK has been torn between health and the economy. I don't know about anyone else but I put health first!"
"Hello, does anyone know what the situation is in my hometown of Volos?"
"Hello Jennya, Very well said. There is no official date on the openings of certain aspects of Greece as of yet but I believe the government have at the forefront of their mind not to undo all the good work the Greek people and government have done by opening up too early. A large part of our economy is tourist based and they do have that in mind but as you say Greece has put the health of its nation at the forefront. Hopefully we will be welcoming you back to our beautiful country in the not too distant future. Greece is ready when the world is, until then stay safe."
HiWe are due to come to Halkidiki on 10th July with Jet2.I've only paid a small deposit and the balance is due on the 4th May. I have reluctantly decided to cancel and forfeit the deposit. This is not because I am worried about the holiday being cancelled (ATOL protected and I paid the deposit by credit card). It's because I'm worried that the holiday WON'T be cancelled. I don't think it will be safe to travel by then and our insurance doesn't cover for anything related to coronavirus. It's not worth the risk sadly.
"Gog1, You'll be lucky if the UK government has lifted the travel advice not to travel by then , but I do understand your thinking and we are due to travel in mid September to the Peloponnese and pondering if its worth it, mine is independently booked so luckily I can cancel the accommodation without penalty upto between 2 and3 weeks before but may have to take a hit on the flight costs. Its all up in the air and we just have to keep safe and Healthy for the good of the great and good people of this little blue and green speck in the universe. We would all like our week or two in Greece enjoying the sunshine, people we meet, food etc but another out break of this would kill any recovery for years."
No more announcements from the UK government until May 5th but press reports say that all people entering the UK will be quarantined for 14 days. I doubt that much else will change otherwise.
"Danny, yes might be worth a try. I'm emailing jet2 today. It's very sad and I feel for all of the people in Greece whose livelihoods depend on tourism."
"The Belgian government 2 nights ago that we are not allowed to leave the country for tourism until ""at least"" 8 June. Same applies for arrivals, nobody allowed in."
"Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to present a plan on Monday or, more likely, Tuesday, for gradually easing the restrictions.In a speech to the nation, Mitsotakis is expected to provide details of a three-phase scheme that aims to restore a significant section of the country’s social and economic life by the end of June. The three phases are to begin in early May, late May and mid-June, with rising temperatures in summer expected to slow the pandemic. The first phase will involve the opening of small retail stores and hair salons. In parallel, authorities may abolish part or all of the system whereby citizens are obliged to send an SMS to a government number, citing their reason for leaving the house. The reopening of cafes and restaurants will come at a later stage, with businesses to operate initially only with tables outdoors and set at a safe distance from each other.Another concern is public transport, with authorities mulling the obligatory use of face masks for commuters and restrictions to passenger numbers. Services may be increased at rush hour to ensure commuters are served. As for the crucial tourism sector, hotels will open in two phases: year-round hotels in early June and seasonal hotels in late June. The initiative will likely involve interventions along the way depending on the evolution of the pandemic, with the possibility of restrictions that are eased being reimposed if experts deem that to be necessary.

"I live in Greece, on Crete& come from the UK. The Greek government have done very well re the Coronavirus. I really wouldn't bet that by July the Greeks will be allowing any flights to & from countries who have not done as well. So flights to & from the USA & the UK won't happen, in my opinion , until at least September. But, what do I know?"
"Absolutely correct Jackie B. Just like the restrictions will be taken down in different steps, so will tourists be allowed in the country in steps based on origin.Edited: 9:08 am, April 26, 2020 "
The Greek government appears to have done well in controlling the spread of the virus. I only know of one case here in Lakonia and that was several weeks ago. My fear is that no immunity has been built up and that the worst is not yet here. I sincerely hope I'm wrong.
"I wonder how they would measure how well a country has controlled the virus? Number of deaths, number of deaths by population density? There are many ways to measure this."
">>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to present a plan on Monday or, more likely, Tuesday, for gradually easing the restrictions.<<Mitsotakis’ address is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, April 28 according media reports."

I just received an 18 month credit voucher for our hotel in Rhodes as they will not be opening until July. Is it possible if I do not use to receive a refund instead?Thank you
James...Who has issued the credit voucher to you? Did you use a third party to book the hotel?
"No the hotel just sent me an email with the voucher saying they would not be opening until JulyWe are constantly updating our cancellation policy to reflect the most recent developments related to the COVID-19 as affects travel plans around the world. Below is the main bodySince the new measurements and flight cancelations force us to be closed until July and according to the new Greek government’s law (attached) issued on 13/4/20 in article 70 and 71 (we will soon receive it in English and will resend to you if requested), all reservations with deposit (none refundable, early booking e.t.c.) can receive a 18 months deposit voucher in order to rebook in the future"
"Those details are helpful James. It seems the hotel has already started to action the government’s ruling on offering refund vouchers. I think if you check the conditions, when available in English, you will find that a refund can be requested, should the voucher not be used within the 18 months’ period. You’ve got a long wait if you decide not to use your voucher!!I note the hotel are offering to send you the conditions in English, upon request, once they have them available. I would drop them a quick email. Thank them (which I’m sure you would!!) and ask for a copy of the conditions. Definitely worth saving them for future reference.Edited: 4:58 pm, April 27, 2020 "
">>you will find that a refund can be requested, should the voucher not be used within the 18 months’ period.<<In the recent Greek law that is mentioned by the hotel, it is also said that it's obligatory to pay a full refund if the voucher is/can not be used within 18 months of issue."
I hoped you’d chip in with further clarification. Thanks Nicksy.
Thanks yes already thanked them and asked for the English version of the Articles when available
That’s good James. Don’t know what your future plans are. Maybe you’ll get to use your voucher next year.Good luck to you. Keep well.
found this article herehttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/2…expectations on 2020 Greece tourism are really low
"From the speech of the Prime Minister:""Following the suggestions of the Scientific Committee, I can today announce the axes of a ""safety bridge"" to the new everyday life:From next Monday, May 4, the restrictions on the movement of citizens will be lifted. In other words, written permission and related SMS are removed. However, traffic restrictions outside our county will continue for at least 2 weeks. Individual sports will be allowed in the open and at sea. But organized beaches will still be closed. Some types of stores and services will be open on the same day. Indicatively, I mention: Bookstores, electronic items, KTEO and sporting goods stores. Like hairdressers, but always by appointment. The rest of the retail will resume on Monday, May 11, except for shopping malls. These will open on June 1.In all stores, of course, terms will apply that will limit the density of visitors. Strict measures will be taken to protect workers.On June 1, the activity in the field of catering begins, always with conditions, which will have been agreed by then. On the same day, the 12-month hotels will open. In June, finally, and depending on the developments, the rest of the economic activity will be gradually released. However, it is unlikely that big gatherings, such as festivals, concerts or sporting events with spectators, will be allowed during the summer.""More details will be posted later as, for the moment, the government's plan is presented in detail by different ministers, each in their own specialized area."
"Some more details by date:4 May 2020First thing to be lifted is the obligation of holding movement permits via sms or handwritten papers.Exercise outdoors and at the sea (swimming!) is allowed. Organized beaches will open at a later point.Opening of small shops, hairdressers’ barbershops, beauty parlors, bookstores, sports-stores, garden shops & optics shops.Churches but only for individual prayer.Traffic restrictions from one prefecture to another will remain in force.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------11 May 2020Opening of other remaining business activity (except shopping malls and department stores)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------17 May 2020Churches open to the public, the faithful are allowed to attend religious services under strict rules.Full operation of public transport means----------------------------------------------------------------------------------18 May 2020Traffic restrictions within the country will be lifted all together, that is movement from one prefecture and away from the area of the residence permit will be lifted. Most possible: traveling to islands will remain only for residents.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 June 2020Opening of shopping malls and department storesCafes, bars, restaurants will be allow to have customers in outdoors space.Opening of hotels that operate on a 12 month basis"
"Thank you, Nicksy, as ever! I'm really grateful for your posts, as, living on Crete we need to know, xxx"
"Yiassas, I followed it on an ERT 1 livestream and with 'live' updated articles from Ta Nea."
"Thank you Nicksy , very much appreciated"
Today the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis released a statement on how Greece will go forward in relaxing the lockdown regulations. It does not state tourism but if you are interested the time frame is below.https:/…
He did say that restoration of international flights would start at the end of June.
I'm sorry philhellene but nowhere in his speech said Mitsotakis something about restoration of international flights to start at the end of June.You can read his speech (in Greek) here: https:/…
Thank you for the information. I understand that the 12 month hotels will open June 1. Any mention when the seasonal hotels will open
"Nicksy - I didn't hear the speech but it was reported here.https:/…Edited: 1:38 am, April 29, 2020 "
"#206. The article you linked suggests the opening of seasonal hotels from July, as well as the resumption of international flights at that time.Mmm, will be interesting to have those points clarified. Could lead to many forlorn hopes if misreported though, of course, the government can only talk about its aims anyway, depending on how things progress in the interim.I imagine much will depend on how things look nearer the time and what minimum protocols can be agreed for airports and airlines."
Unfortunately the press is in the habit of reporting things that are opinions rather than facts. Clearly we are dealing with a very fluid situation and nothing can be taken for granted.
"From Stelios Petsas according to Ta Nea.'On June 1, according to the prevailing scenario, the twelve-month hotel units, which are located mainly in Athens and Thessaloniki, will open, while for the 1st of July the opening of seasonal accommodation will take place, and ""after the issue of transport is settled"". At the same time, Mr. Petsas noted that the Prime Minister has requested a common European framework for transport at the last Summit.'There is an implication here of the resumption of flights at the same time as opening of seasonal accommodation. There wouldn’t be any point in opening seasonal accommodation if visitors couldn’t get there."
"Hello everyone, If anybody is looking for detailed information in English I highly recommend that you visit the site below. The Real Greek Experiences translates and breaks down all the current updates regarding the restrictions in detail. https:/…"
"I think a lot will depend on the EU getting its act together quickly and coming up with some common ground rules for European travel.Then I imagine international flights might commence a bit later, with those from Australia and some of the lesser virus hit countries being amongst the first welcomed in. No alternative but to wait and see how things progress. I take my hat off to Greece though. They’ve managed the current crisis brilliantly."
>>I think a lot will depend on the EU getting its act together quickly and coming up with some common ground rules for European travel.<<There is a meeting today of the ministers of transport of the EU countries.
"Some more detailed rules when the gradual lifting of the lockdown restrictions starts:The Greek government may have announced the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions but heavy fines will remain in force. The tariff is the same as for the violation of the movement permit during the lockdown: 150 euros. But this time, the amount will be paid by those who do not wear a mask where they should.As of May 4, the use of mask is mandatory or strongly recommended in closed spaces such as hospitals, supermarkets and grocery stores, retail and other shops, public transport means and taxis, and especially in areas where there is close physical contact like in hairdressers, barbershops and beauty parlors.The use of a maskis:Compulsory for customers and workers in hairdressers, barbershops, beauty salons and all services presupposing close physical contact as well as for workers in supermarkets and grocery stores.Strongly recommended for workers and customers in all closed spaces (indoors) and public transport meansThe presence of the number of customers depends on the size of the business facility and this depends again on the sector of the facility. A 2-meter safety distance among customers should be kept, workers and customers should wear a mask.In retail shops, the guidelines are: up to 20 sq.m. 4 people, from 20 sq.m. – 100 sq.m. 4 people + 1 person / 10 sq.m. and more than 100 sq.m. 12 people + 1/15 sq.m.For barbershops, hairdressers and beauty salons, a distance of 2 meters will be applied between the workplaces, the number of customers present at the same time will again depend on the size of the facilities.Customers should seek the facility following a phone call and registration and the business owner will compile a list at the begin of the daily operation and must be shown to authorities in case of control. Doors and windows should be open when hairdryer is used, but when closed no hairdryer should be used.It is recommended to refrain from using elevators in shops and if necessary for people with mobility issues only 40% of the allowed number of persons should be inside. That is if the capacity is for 10 people, only 4 are allowed to use it at a time. If the shop has rolling stairs, the use of elevator is not permitted.Apparently the same rule should be applied to public and private buildings.In cafes, bars and restaurants that are expected to open again but only their outdoors sections beginning of June, the distance between the tables must be 1.5 meters and no more than 4 people can sit at a table, Employees should wear masks and gloves and disinfectants should be at every table.Edited: 10:29 am, April 29, 2020 "
"Transport ministers of Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal urged the EU executive today to suspend EU-rules forcing cash-drained airlines to offer full refunds for cancelled flights instead of vouchers for future travel because of the Covid-19 pandemic.In a joint statement, they said the bloc's executive should propose the amendment as a matter of urgency. Consumers should be made to settle for vouchers instead of refunds with certain conditions.Vouchers should be valid for a set length of time and should include the right for reimbursement if they are not used before the end of that period. Protection should also be provided in the case of airline bankruptcies."
I think the very last sentence you’ve quoted is the one that many people would like to see agreed asap. It might allay any fears then about accepting a voucher.Thank you once again for your expediency Nicksy.
"EU had already said that the voucher be refundable at the end of expiry period and should be bankruptcy protected. What EU had also said was that the vouchers be at the option of the passengers if they choose not to take cash refund. Refundable vouchers are essentially interest free loans to airlines, which is fine by me because the ban on travel was imposed by the government and on both the travellers and the airlines. So, vouchers seem like a fair middle-ground.But something needs to be done about reducing the airlines bankruptcy risk."
"I didn't know the ""roadmap"" existed in an English version. Thanks Yiassas !!!!"
"And still there will be those that ones again start a new thread with a question or a remark ""because they heard"" that it will be possible to go on holidays to Greece by the end of June or early July."
So what do you think about travel from the USA to Greece Mid September. I have not had my airlines or any of my accommodations cancel. Do you think there is a glimmer of hope I will be able to go?
"Thank you Yiassas for sharing that roadmap, the English version. It has come in handy to share with English friends. Also thank you to this forum it is doing an exceptional job of sharing honest and official information."
Found this up to date information from the official website for Visit Greece. Shows a 7 stage reopening plan taking place in Greece during May and June. www.visitgreece.gr/en/home/about_covid_19
Perhaps an extension to the tourist season by a month till October might be an idea
"The temporary restrictions on passenger travel to the islands has been extended until Monday, May 18, 2020 at 06:00."
"I'm booked for a flight with Swiss Airlines for Sept. 30. As of now the flight is still on and all my accommodations and car rental bookings are still on.However, it all depends on what Greece will decide, especially what countries will be allowed to fly into Greece.I'm staying optimistic that things will improve through late spring and early summer that a positive decision will be made to open up Greece with the proper precautions.I have the option to rebook up until Aug. 31 for a flight before April 31, 2021 but I doubt I can travel before April 31.A refund is ""possible"" but not much info has been provided.It's a wait-and-see situation but still time for something good to happen."
I'm quite sure that it will not be possible to fly on April 31.
"lol, philhellene! He made the same mistake on at least three other threads."
"The Prime Minister’s Office is almost ready to announce its integrated package for the revival of tourism. The plan, according to the latest information available, is built on four pillars. The first concerns the health issue and the rules of operation for the sector regarding both hotels and the markets from which the country may allow visitors when this is deemed safe. the 2nd is about support for the employment, the 3rd is about economic support and the 4th covers compensating action for the local entrepreneurs.One of the biggest issues however which has yet to be settled is that of bilateral agreements. Although all parties involved speak of the need for a single set of rules, regarding international travel and and the operation of businesses, in fact more and more people are worrying about how this could be rapidly achieved so that the whole of this year is not lost and 2021 is not undermined. The complexity of the problem combined with the disagreements in every country, often between health and political authorities, point to the unlikelihood of a common position being formed before this fall. Therefore more voices are speaking of the need for bilateral agreements setting the rules for a country to admit another country’s citizens.Source: https:/…blueprint-prepared-for-tourismTourism Minister Haris Theocharis said on Saturday that “overland tourism will recover faster so the conditions must exist for the fast opening of the borders with neighboring countries”.Speaking to the Athens-Macedonia News Agency (AMNA), Theocharis pointed out that overland tourism is a priority for the markets of the Balkans.He added that the ministry is currently “forming the necessary health protocols for the road entrance gates to Greece and in parallel we are proceeding with all the necessary actions to make the tourist flows from the Balkans feasible.”Edited: 2:00 pm, May 02, 2020 "
Thanks for posting Nicksy. Some very complex issues to be settled yet but encouraging nonetheless.
Our flight from the US was just cancelled by the airline yesterday for the end of July. I guess Greece is off for this year. Flights were cheap too. Oh well. Next year.
"#237, were you on the Delta JFK-Athens flight? On that flight at the end of August and keeping my hopes up."
My boyfriend and I are going to have wedding in Santorini in mid September 2020. Deposit has been paid to the wedding planner however our flight has been cancelled by the airline (bangkok to Santorini). Hope everything will be fine in this summer
"Hello everyone I hope you are all well. The world travel and tourism council have today stated that they plan to release new protocols within the next 2 weeks designed at a safe and responsible road to recovery in the tourism sector. They will share these protocols with government globally. As stated in previous posts what ever is done has to be done bilaterally. Some of the plans that they wish to release include new social distancing regulations in hotels, more card transactions and less cash, disinfecting airports regularly and testing at airports. Here is the link to the articlehttps:/…I have also read today that they may bring forward the date that people are allowed to travel between the islands. This obviously accounts for people already in Greece but it is a positive sign. The article below states that it may be as early as the 25th of May. It also states that all year round hotels might open earlier as planned as well. https:/…"
All will depend on how the figures will be in the days (1-2 weeks) after lifting part of the restrictions.>>It would be interesting to know if all the governments have or will be talking to Airlines as they seem to have different dates<<Airlines can maybe advertise that they will start again on certain dates. But they will still depend on the dates set by the authorities and not the other way round.
"Yes I agree, In my opinion if you are wanting solid and factual data regarding tourism in Greece you should be listening to the Greek government. Nothing will happen without their approval. Up until now they have been very punctual and thorough when releasing information. Below are two articles, I believe have just been published today. One is from the prime minister himself 'Kyriakos Mitsotakis' discussing tourism for this season and the other is regarding certain possibilities and regulations on the opening of beaches. https:/…https:/…"
Thanks for sharing these further 2 links Katerina- very informative.
Just a reminder that the presentations of the Greek government about the Plan for the gradualeasing of COVID 19 restrictive measures can be seen her in English:https:/…
"Speaking at the Parliament on Monday, Tourism Minister, Haris Theoharis, presented the key points of a 5-pilar plan to support the tourism sector, saying that the government will make use of all opportunities to support tourism, but in compliance with health rules.”The 5 pilars of the plan are Health, Finance, Diplomacy, Promotion & International contacts.HealthProtocols are being drawn up for hotels, marinas, yachting, tourist coaches, airplanes, etc. These are realistic, the minister said, adding that the conditions will be such that neither the health of local residents and visitors nor the reputation of destinations will be endangered.On May 8, the working groups of the Ministry of Tourism with EODY (the Greek national public health organisation) will be ready with all the health protocols so that the consultation with the social partners can proceed. FinancialThe demand will not be enough to be able to absorb all the workers. The numbers will not be positive but they are not positive for any country,” said the minister and underlined that the employees who will not be absorbed, will be supported by the government.The companies that will open and will be present at this difficult time, supporting the tourism product, will be supported by the government.DiplomacyDiplomatic moves will be needed to secure support from other countries, since Greece will be ready to receive tourists. “However, if the German, the Russian or the US government place those returning from Greece in quarantine/house isolation, then no tourists will come,” Theoharis said.“However, we cannot force anyone to do so. We will seek the maximum possible result,” the minister said adding “measures will be taken to support domestic tourism.”Working groups are already working with specific countries to open the borders as soon as possible. (Note: it has bbeen said before the weekend that probably the landborderposts with Balkan countries (Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia) will probably be the first to open.)PromotionA new campaign promoting Greece will be ready in the coming weeks.International contactsGreece plans to open all-year hotels on June 1 and the remaining tourists’ accommodation facilities a month later.The government appears certain that the tourism seasons in summer 2020 will be able to run in the months of July, August and September, and hopes to extend it to October and November.However, this presupposes that international flights and ferries will resume in time. The exact date for Greece to open for tourism also depends on airlines and the implementation of strict health protocols in foreign flights.https:/…"
"Nicksy, just a question again about the possibility you were mentioning of Greece opening its borders to neighboring countries' tourists. I keep reading talks (pressures ?) that any reopening of tourism should be ""coordinated at the European level"", or some such. Does that mean that this possibility of unilateral/bilateral lifting of traveling restrictions must be excluded, or are there separate issues with regards to road, on the one hand, and air travel, on the other ?Edit : I sent my post just at the same time as your last one, this one has an interesting point, I will write soonEdited: 9:03 am, May 05, 2020 "
"""“However, if the German, the Russian or the US government place those returning from Greece in quarantine/house isolation, then no tourists will come,” Theoharis said.“However, we cannot force anyone to do so.

(Note: it has been said before the weekend that probably the landborderposts with Balkan countries (Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia) will probably be the first to open.)""This has a few very interesting points. (First of all, it sounds that Greece is very, very eager for tourism to restart - but then again, that's the Tourism Minister speaking, I guess the Health Minister is very, very eager that nobody gets infected, on the other hand... )What does Theoharis mean by ""no tourist will come"" ? That they won't come, by their own choice, if that means that they would come back to quarantine at home, or that Greece, or their own country, would stop them from traveling ?I, for one (and my girfriend from Moscow too), would be happy to spend 30 days in Greece even if it meant staying at home for 14 days when going back, as this is the normal situation for us anyway (but I understand we'd be in an insignificant minority... )Incidentally, he doesn't seem to be too bothered by the fact that Russia is still on the rising phase of the virus (so it seems, anyway). But if he's talking about July then it makes sense, it still is a long way off.And what does he mean, in your opinion, by « we cannot force anyone to do so (…) we will seek the maximum result » ? That he would be ready to take unilateral decisions allowing some tourists to come, under a set of conditions ?With regards to land borders opening with neighbors, this is something that is very interesting to me (I could come from Serbia or Montenegro, if I can’t fly from France), but I don’t understand how that is possible. That would mean letting people into Schengen space, while Schengen is still officially - as far as I’m aware - closed. What do you think about that ?"

"Nicolas, see also the 2nd link beneath the list I mentioned in #250. That 2nd link opens a PDF form with (for every country) very detailed information on what border posts there are. It's a list published today. Unfortunately Greece seems to be missing from that document. Probably because there are for the moment no border crossings opened."
"@251. If I have to be guaranteed at home after returning from Greece, I would still go to Greece. I wouldn't, however, go to Greece if I had to be guaranteed there for 14 days in the same hotel."
Is there any official announcement from Greece or the EU that Greece will not be open for international tourism until after June 1st? I need an official statement to apply for a refund. Thank you.
Thank you. I will monitor this site for the next few days. Unfortunately there is no specific date in the State department advisory beyond the end of April. But I will send all the information with my refund request.
reading the most recent posts it looks (to me) that1. Greece will be open to tourists late summer/autumn2. the restricitons/conditions in place by tourists home countries and Greece itself will discourage many tourists from travellingbasically tourists will want to go there but it may be too much hassle
The big question is: From where/what countries will Greece allow flights/tourist to come to Greece.If I was the responsible person within the Greek government I would look at figures from other countries and as the situation is now I would certainly exclude certain countries.
"it all down to restrictions. if there is going to be quarantine, or a risk of quarantine, in the country of origin or in Greece then tourists will be fearful of travelling"

Tourists should be tested when they return to their own countries.Tourists will leave the country without any control, so that there will be no risk of being trapped in the country and stay in quarantine.Hotels“Quarantine hotels” in every tourist areaThe Ministry of Tourism will rent a tourist accommodation in each tourist area of ​​the country which will function as a “quarantine hotel.” Tourists who are found to be carriers of the coronavirus will be transferred there.Each hotel or tourist accommodation will be obliged to contract with a doctor, who will determine whether a tourist must undergo a COVID-19 test. The diagnosis will be either live or via telemedicine.The test results will be released within six hours so that anyone who is tested positive can be transferred to “quarantine hotels”.Special training in hygiene rules will be provided to the staff of each hotel.There will be no buffets in the hotels, except in small hotels.Sunbeds will be installed at a safety distance to each other and will have a disposable cover for each swimmer.https:/…"

"The European Commission has proposed to Schengen countries and Associate countries on Friday to extend a restriction on nonessential travel, i.e. travel ban on non-EU nationals for another 30 days, until June 15, 2020.Although several countries are slowly starting to ease restrictions, the situation remains “fragile” across the globe and the bloc must make sure to prevent the coronavirus spreading through travel to the EU, the Commission argued. Its priority is to open borders between EU countries before opening the bloc area to the rest of the world.According to the European Commission roadmap, first national lockdown measures should be completely lifted to transition to normal life.Based on the European Commission proposal, it is the member states who need to decide on the extension of travel restrictions.The opening of external borders for non-EU citizens will be the last stage of the procedure should they manage to avoid a second outbreak.The travel restriction, as well as the invitation to extend it, applies to the ‘EU+ area’, which includes all Schengen Member States (including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania) and the 4 Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) – 30 countries in total.The Commission calls for a continued coordinated approach to the prolongation, as action at the external borders can only be effective if implemented by all EU and Schengen States at all borders, with the same end date and in a uniform manner.Any further prolongation of the travel restriction beyond 15 June 2020 would need to be assessed again, based on the evolution of the epidemiological situation, the Commission statement said.The travel restriction does not apply to EU citizens, citizens of non-EU Schengen countries and their family members, and non-EU nationals who are long-term residents in the EU for the purpose of returning home.In addition, to limit to the minimum the impact of the restriction on the functioning of our societies, Member States should not apply the restrictions to specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need. Essential staff, such as doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, researchers and experts helping to cope with the coronavirus, as well as persons carrying goods, frontier workers and seasonal agricultural workers, should also continue to be allowed to enter the EU.Edited: 7:13 am, May 09, 2020 "

"For post 272, it doesn't state that tourists will be tested once they enter Greece, only that they must have a health certificate issued 72 hours prior to arriving. Are the quarantine hotels and doctor consults that are mentioned only for people who might start showing symptoms after arriving? Thanks Nicksy for such detailed posts :)"
"#280 That question occurred to me too Holly because, in theory, tourists should be free of Covid-19 when entering Greece. I think this shows acceptance that the 72hr prior health check has its weaknesses and contingency plans have been drawn up to deal with the possible consequences of that.Sorry...my post has crossed with Nicksy’s response.Edited: 1:33 pm, May 09, 2020 "
They are Holly. In case somebody feels ill after being in Greece for some days.
"Got it - thanks to all 3 of you for the responses. This seems like a reasonable option as long as people are able to secure testing before leaving home. My worry has been testing at the airport when you arrive in the case of a false positive. We're from the US so I have very low hope that we'll be able to travel there this year, but keeping my fingers crossed for maybe later in the season :)Edited: 1:50 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"Personnally I cannot see most European countries being able to issue holidaymakers with certificates. It seems that most countries have their hands full testing frontline workers and people showing symptoms.I have two seperate visits to Greece booked but very much doubt I would be able to get a certificate here in the UK.Edited: 9:57 am, May 10, 2020 "
"The government has a plan for the lifting of restrictions for travel to the island. The plan has 3 phases.Phase 1 starts tommorrow, 11 May and is aimed at professionals like supplementary teachers as schools open on Monday, May 11, for students of the 3rd grade of Lyceum. Other professionals allowed to travel to the islands as of May 11 are workers at retail stores and businesses that open also on May 11.Travel to the islands either by ship or airplane requires that private sector employees provide documents and necessary certificates by the employer.Phase 2 would start on May 18, when the restrictions to travel from prefecture to prefecture are lifted, Also workers in the tourism sector will be allowed to travel to the islands. Of course, they will also need the relevant certificates.Phase 3 is if things go smoothly, That is no set back and increase in the number of coronavirus infections, This phase is scheduled to happen as of June 1 and will allow travel for all to the islands.The Minister of Shipping confirmed the new safety rules for traveling by ferry in summer 2020.- Ferries and ships will travel with 50% of their passenger capacity.- The use of mask is mandatory by both the crew and the passengers.- Greek and foreign passengers will have to fill up questionnaires about their state of health before allowed to embark.- 1 person per cabin is allowed, and up to 4 in case of families.- Cabins will need to be booked at the first port of the route and not at the intermediate ports.- Getting on and off the ship will take place by keeping the safety distance."
"I feel the pain! We go out for our walk and stand into the side to let people pass often with nettles, brambles biting our ankles and other folk pass along the path two abreast not seemingly aware of social distancing!"
"First weekend in Athens, after they started to ease the restrictions - there were more people on the streets, queues at the coffee-shops (only take aways). I also made a short video from the center of Athens from the last weekend. We all hope that the situation with traveling will be improving. So many of people here in Greece are very much dependant on tourism....https:/…"
Has anyone heard whether dual national European and American citizens that live in the United States and are coming to Greece right now (before May 18) are taken to a hotel where they get tested when they arrive in Athens? And that they stay in the hotel at no charge for a couple of days until the test results are issued?

I was just emailed a voucher from the hotel I booked in August which is valid for 18 months. A refund is provided after that 18 month period if the voucher is not used. Is this something that I must accept or am I able to decline it for a refund which I receive immediately?
"#296. Hi. You cannot opt for an immediate refund. As you’ve already stated, a refund will only be paid if the voucher is not used within 18 months.Here is a link to an article that explains the arrangement.https:/…"
"Hi,I'm considering an extended visit to Athens this summer. I understand that resorts will only open in July, but ""year-round hotels"" will open on 1st of June. Which of these date do new entry conditions start to apply? Would it be possible to arrive to Athens in June (I presume there are many hotels that are considered ""year-round"")? Thanks :)Edited: 8:28 pm, May 11, 2020 "
"Phase 3 tourism means for visitors from EU. The Schengen zone countries have not yet opened their borders to outsiders. So maybe the Germans can vacation in Greece but not Americans, at least as of now."
@PiersonB: And how are they supposed to travel from the US to Greece as there are no flights? And certainly not before 18 May.And nobody is taken to a hotel to get tested. The current rule is still 14 days self isolation. But even that won't be possible as hotels that are open all year round will normally only be allowed to open from June 1st. There is a lot of information on this FAQ page of the Athens airport website: https:/…

Greece has sent a proposal to reboot tourism to the European Commission. At the bottom of this article there is a link to a PDF document with the full text of the Greek proposal: https://www.ekathimerini.com/252599/article/…
"Hello,Are flights to the islands are actually canceled until at least May 25? Does anyone have suggestions on how to get through to either Aegean or Travel Genio ( yes, I know now that their business practices are questionable) to get a refund for a May 21 flight from Athens to Naxos? I have tried contacting both following the links on their websites but all I'm getting are vague form replies."
"Courtesy of @SteveSitia:You can find the newly released European Commission policy on how travel & tourism can be safely reintroduced here:https:/…Note there are several downloadable PDFs with further detail.The document is a EU-wide overall strategy - please don't read this hoping you will see the dates that flights will start from your home country, it does not yet have that level of detail.Edited: 1:44 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"According the government's spokesman, Greece will announce the protocols for air, maritime and road traveling on Friday, May 15.He added that it had not been self-evident that the EU would arrive at a common European framework, so Greece will unveil its own comprehensive plan for tourism."
Thanks Nicksy - I will keep my fingers crossed for good news.Meant to be going to Zante on 7th July.
"According Greek media, Aegean Airlines have announced they will restart operations by the end of May from Athens to Munich, Zurich, Frankfurt and Geneva, initially with a reduced timetable. It will also add more flights to Brussels – the only international destination that had not been suspended.They will also increase flights in their domestic network from May 18 and 25, adding capacity to destinations including Heraklion and Chania in Crete, Thessaloniki, Alexandroupoli and the islands of Rhodes, Corfu, Lesvos, Chios and Samos.https://www.ekathimerini.com/252680/article/…"
Fantastic news for Aegean. Small steps . . .
"You will have to go through the website. As far as I can see Aegean Air is giving vouchers for the full amount of flights which can be used for 18 months from the date of issue free of charge.https://en.aegeanair.com/voucher-application/You can request a refund, depending on the type of ticket. If you are eligible for a refund it will cost Flex ticket 45 EUR per direction per ticket. Golight 20 EUR https://en.aegeanair.com/plan/fare-rules/"
"Re #311: as I read it, in the refunds paragraph it states with Flex fare both the fare and taxes will be refunded, while with GoLight only the taxes will be refunded."
"Basically, the refund will happen as per fare rules. My two tickets were Flex but I opted for vouchers. Will hope for the health and survival of Olympic / Aegean for the next two years and have the vouchers converted into cash after the 18-month period.One of my flights got preponed by 5 minutes while the other one got cancelled and they rebooked me to a flight departing some 50 minutes earlier. But their representative on twitter said I was eligible for the 18 month voucher for both. So, I have applied for the vouchers. Let's see when I get them."
"The Greek Civil Aviation Authority has issued this afternoon following aviation instructions:– The suspension of all passenger flights to and from Greece to Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands is extended until 31 May 2020 at 23:59.– The temporary ban on flights to and from Albania and Northern Macedonia is extended until June 14, 2020 at 23:59.- The ban on all flights to Greek territory regarding Turkey extends until June 14, 2020 at 23:59– International flights (arrivals/departures) from other EU-countries are only allowed to the Athens airport “Eleftherios Venizelos”. This specific aviation directive is valid until May 31, 2020 at 23:59– The temporary ban on entry into the country of non-European citizens remains currently in force until at least 31 May 2020 at 23:59.Head of Greek Civil Protection Nikos Hardalias said on Friday afternoon that instructions for travelling by road to Greece are expected to be announced in the next few days, maybe on Saturday, May 16."
"Nicksy, does that mean that any EU passenger could board a plane say, in Paris, and land in Athens tomorrow (provided there are flights, I haven't checked), or is there still a restriction on the purpose of travel and/or quarantine measures ?"
"Nicolas,Air France has announced they will start with flights from Paris (CDG) to Athens on 23 May. But only 1 flight a week. So, the next flight will be on 30 May. The flights will then increase on a weekly basis: there will be three flights per week as of June 1, four as of June 8, seven as of June 15 and eleven as of June 22.They added that additionally, the direct flight between Paris (CDG) and Heraklion, Crete will also resume on June 27. Air France said it will take infrared temperature readings of passengers before embarkation on any flight. And passengers will have to wear a mouthmask on board.Normally there is no quarantine measure on arrival in Athens. Allthough it could be that the Greek government will announce additional measures for passengers flying in on international flights.And...does the French government allow you to travel outside France and what when you return? Quarantine, selfisolation?"
"Thanks Nicksy.The French government, as far as I know, cannot stop its citizens from leaving the country (at least I hope - we're not North Korea yet !), nor have I heard of a country that does. It might impose a self-isolation measure for those returning, but that doesn't affect me has I stay at home anyway. I have not much to do here in Paris at the moment, I am looking for a place where I could travel with my Russian partner, currently stuck in Moscow, until they reopen Schengen visa applications, which might not be before many months, if ever at all, who knows... (I think it was you, or somebody else on this forum, that mentioned that maybe Greece was willing to allow Russian tourists in this summer). So I'm looking at Greece, and Montenegro is also another possibility"
">>The French government, as far as I know, cannot stop its citizens from leaving the country (at least I hope - we're not North Korea yet !), nor have I heard of a country that does.<<Belgian government decided some time ago that we can't travel abroad till at least 8 June."
"Yes, but was does that mean ? That they stop you at the border/prevent you from boarding planes ? That they stop you from going to the airport (presumably that what the case here during confinement, but the confinement has been lifted, we can move 100km form home) ? Or that there is a quarantine imposed on returning travelers ?I don't even know if it's legal to prevent someone from exiting the country, as long as the country he's traveling to accepts him. Sounds crazy"
">>Yes, but was does that mean ? That they stop you at the border/prevent you from boarding planes ?<<Indeed, that is what happens. The only way you can board a plane or travel abroad is with proof that your trip is essential."
"Is that part of lockdown framework ? Are you still under lockdown in Belgium. Thankfully here it has been lifted, I can travel at least as far as the airport"
"Yes, it's part of the lockdown measures. Some have been lifted already, some more will be lifted from next monday. That will allow me to visit my parents (90 & 93) for the first time since 7 March. They live in a care center and visitors were not allowed."
"Greece plans to open cafes, restaurants and bars a week earlier than originally scheduled, that is instead of June 1, already on May 25.The consideration for early opening is taken into account the latest development of the coronavirus epidemiological data.Apparently due to the positive results, Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis announced on Friday that shopping malls will open on Monday, May 18, also earlier than originally scheduled.In all sectors, rules of hygiene measures, face masks and keeping social distancing are implemented in order to avoid a resurgence of coronavirus cases."
"Greece is slowly going back to normal. All passenger ferry services will resume throughout Greece on Monday, May 18.The new regulations call for passengers to maintain a distance of 1.5 meters (5 feet) between each other during embarkation and disembarkation; allowing only one person per cabin; the mandatory use of face masks for both passengers and crew; and dispersing passengers so they do not occupy adjacent seats. Additionally, for passengers on international (Greece-Italy) routes, they also include the taking of temperatures when boarding, along with the submission of statements of health before departure.These guidelines will remain in place until June 15, after which they may be relaxed.Other rules stipulate that private and commercial vessels coming from foreign countries — EXCEPT CRUISE SHIPS — will be permitted to dock at Greek marinas, shipyards or ports if they do not carry passengers, and comply with specific health measures as well as obtaining the permission of local port authorities.Vessels hailing from countries where coronavirus lockdown measures still apply will not be allowed to approach Greek ports."
Is there any indication of when tourists from UK & Ireland can visit? Thanks
"No, there isn't. I don't think it will be any time soon."
"Thanks Jackie B :(Edited: 10:42 am, May 16, 2020 "
Still not much info on whether people from the US will be allowed in.
I believe it’s up to the European Commission to decide when external borders of the EU/Schengen countries will be open to the US and other non-Europeans. Up until now all the talk has been about opening internal borders.
I'll just have to hold out as long as possible before either rebooking or asking for a refund for my flight in early October. I have until Aug. 31 to make a decision. I would think by sometime in July there could be come definite answer.
"crazyh, it is still 4 months away. A lot can happen in 4 months. I'm not cancelling anything either. I'll wait till I hear something definite. It is a pain though, cause I can't make any more reservations right now. I hate the uncertainty."
"Re: crazyh Is the 31 August deadline due to any specific reason? I know Aegean and Brussel Airlines are currently allowing rebooking of flights only if you request before 31 August. However, they may have to extend that if countries still have restrictions beyond then because if they don't they'll be inundated with refund requests for cancelled flights."
"epm84: The Aug. 31 deadline is what Swiss Airlines has imposed. I can re-book a flight up to April 31, 2021 but I normally travel to Greece in October. I doubt I can travel to Greece before then due to business matters.They have given me an option of a refund but didn't offer much details.If I don't re-book or ask for a refund the flight is still scheduled but the more important issue is what conditions Greece will have about international flights from the US such as:testing before boarding the plane or upon arrival (If I'm positive and can't fly or enter the country do I get my money back not only for the flight but any bookings I've made?If positive upon arrival will I have to quarantine for 14 days (not much of a holiday if so)I'm holding out as long as possible to see what conditions will be like and what Greece will allow for tourists from the US.Another issue: I have a lay over in Switzerland. Will they be testing people upon arrival?Lots of questions and the uncertainty is not fun!"
"Crazyh: Yes I agree there's lot of uncertainty. I'm not sure how well testing works in the US but over in the UK currently we have the army doing tests at pop-up test centres but at the moment only for certain people. Even for those people it's appointment only, they run hours behind schedule and then some of the tests come back as inconclusive so they have to be repeated!As things stand British people arriving in Greece would have to do a 14 day quarantine on arrival and then another 14 day quarantine on returning home. The UK and France have come to an arrangement to prevent quarantine periods being necessary but that doesn't extend to other EU countries at the moment despite France getting a lot more COVID-19 cases than most EU countries. Although, you could say all that's irrelevant at present as foreign travel for leisure purposes is not permitted."
"Today the mandatory 14-day self-quarantine rule for all passengers arriving from abroad has been extended until midnight May 31, 2020 according the Greek Civil Aviation Athority. This self-quarantine/self isolation is for all citizens arriving from abroad whether Greek or foreign nationals."
It says on Bbc news website that Greece requests exemption from uk quarantine.
"Yes, looks like the UK government is rethinking its strategy on those returning to the UK from abroad. The 14 day quarantine period once back in the UK might only apply to higher risk categories, i.e. those returning from higher Covid-19 incidence countries. Await official policy.Greece might well have requested exemption because of its low Covid rate and the fact that those returning from Greece would not have to quarantine, hence less of a deterrent to holiday there.Edited: 10:51 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"As you would know, Nicksy, quarantine here means proper quarantine i.e. you can't leave the address you have given to the authorities for 14 days: no shopping, no nothing! Police check up regularly. Some friends of ours who live here on Crete had to do 14 days, having come back from the UK at the beginning of all this. The Police came around twice during the 2 weeks to check they were at home. Fines for breaking quarantine."
"i am due to fly to kefalonia with jet 2 on the 17th june the very day they say flights will commence. my worry is if kefalonia is not open as we are self catering, is it the case that if greece were still to be in some kind of lockdown jet2 would be told they would not be able to fly? it seems impossible to get through to find out, if i have to self isolate once there for 2 weeks i only have a weeks holiday till i return , how does this work? i would rather keep the country safe than go ."
Any word from the government (or media) on (1) borders opening for non-EU residents (2) testing on arrival and elimination of 14-day quarantine for healthy arrivals?I see Iceland is heading this direction so hopefully Greece will follow. Time is running out for people to make summer plans.
I just saw this (which is yet to be confirmed but it's a reputable source): https://www.ekathimerini.com/252799/article/…Headline: No restrictions/tests/quarantine on incoming travellers after July 1st from EU (which will include the UK as it's in transition)
"Greece’s Tourism Minister, Haris Theoharis, has proposed that Greece and the U.K. mutually lift the quarantine for travelers between the two countries. The UK should exempt Greeks from the planned quarantine measures for foreign nationals entering the country and in return Greece will not impose the 14-day quarantine on Brits entering Greece.You can hear the interview on BBC’s “The Coronavirus Newscast” here (starts at 20.30): https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08djwvn"
"We'll have to wait until the end of May to see what the Greek government will do about the quarantine for foreign travelers to Greece.It would be a waste of time and money to fly to Greece and be holed up in a hotel room for 14 days!All international tourists will just have to hold on for bit longer to see what Greece will do.After all it's their country and they should do what's best to protect its citizens and guests also.I'm fortunate that my trip isn't schedule until early October. There still may be time for things to get better and Greece to open up the country albeit with some safety guidelines for everyone, Greeks and guests!"
I fully expect June July to be cancelledHow many people will actually go in that period if even allowed?Maybe 25% of the bookings Thats not viable for the airlines.
US travellers should also watch the State Department’s website for changes in the Global Health Advisory. At the moment it is Level 4: Do Not Travelhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html
"I've seen that Travel Advisary but it hasn't been updated since March 14.Another issue is the delay of renewing Passports. The US government is now saying due to the virus the staff has been cut and renewing or getting a passport could take several months! My passport expires August 2020. I better get on the stick!Also received this from the Greece Embassy in Washington, DI:Good afternoon,The temporary restriction of entering Greece for all third-country nationals from any entry point for preventive reasons for the protection of public health from the further spread of COVIC-19 in the Greek territory, has been extended till June 15, 23.00 Please stay tuned with the news updates for the post June 15 situation.https://eody.gov.gr/en/covid-19/https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/https:/…Best Regards Consular OfficeEmbassy of Greece in Washington DC2217 Massachusetts Ave NW 20008tel. 202-939-1300"
"Third-country nationals means non-EU nationals, right?"
"Yes, that's the EU name for non-EU"
"“ I've seen that Travel Advisary but it hasn't been updated since March 14.”The State Department updates that website immediately when changes occur, so you need to check it frequently. No one will stop you from travelling overseas during Level 4 (assuming you can get a flight), but it will affect travel insurance and support you can expect from the US Embassy if lockdown is reinstated.There is also a link to the US Embassy in Athens.Edited: 4:36 am, May 20, 2020 "
"Technically non-EU and 3rd country aren't the same thing as third country excludes countries in the EFTA and EEA which aren't in the EU i.e. Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. At borders in Europe you'll often see signs saying ""EU and EEA citizens"""
"Normally no one except Europeans knows what EFTA and EEA is and many never even heard about Schengen. The question came from a poster from India but if you really need the 100% accurate definition, it is here:third country:https:/…third-country_enthird country national: https:/…third-country-national_en"
Thanks for the information.
I check every now and then to see what's going on.In the end it will be up to Greece to decide who can enter their country and under what conditions.I'm still hopeful things will improve before I have to decide to re-book or cancel my flight by Aug. 31.Stay safe!
"Apparently, the Greek government will release a few guidelines on tourism today, or maybe tomorrow."
"Greece’s long-awaited tourist season will begin on June 15 with the opening of seasonal hotels.Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says international flights will begin heading directly to tourist destinations on July 1. In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday, Mitsotakis says visitors would be subject to sample coronavirus testing and “our general health protocols will be adhered to.”https:/…Wonder whether they mean flights to and from other EU countries too when they say international flights."
"I'd be delighted to travel in June and July. I don't really care about the state dept. warnings as they add no value. We've been on lockdown for 2 months so we are clean. Similarly I see little risk renting a villa on an island where we plan to have minimal contract with others (as is the case currently. The biggest risk to our health is use of airports and airplanes, but that can be reduced through use of N-95 masks, appropriate spacing (assuming flights are not packed) and frequent sanitizing. Would be delighted to visit Greece once the borders are open, and in fact I think many travelers from US present less risk than UK as we've had almost nil cases in many counties."
"Greece opens again its gates to foreign tourists without tests and quarantine on June 15, 2020. Foreign tourists will not undergo tests and will not be placed in quarantine, but there will be the right for random testing, Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis announced on Wednesday. Theoharis said that initially citizens from some 20 countries will be allowed depending on the epidemiological data in their countries.A second group of countries will be added on July 1, with the exception of some countries with negative epidemiological characteristics.The gradual lifting of the remaining exceptions is set for July 15.He said that the lists of the countries to be exempted will be ready by the end of May.Timeschedule for accommodation and flights:Accommodation25. May : Opening of yachting (domestic)June 1: Opening of all-year hotels, camping facilitiesJune 15: Opening of seasonal hotels and accommodationsFlightsJune 15: Opening of Athens International Airport to flights from all countries with good epidemiological data.July 1: Opening of all Greek regional airports also in tourist destinations.FerrytravelTravel to Greek islands by ferry is allowed from May 25, 2020, Head of Civil Protection, Nikos Hardalias announced on Tuesday evening during the daily briefing on the course of the coronavirus in the country. But travel to the islands is not the same as the years before. Passengers’ will be checked on temperature and will have to fill up questionnaires that will hand out to the crew before allowed onboard.The same procedures are to be followed also on the ferry lines between Greece and Italy.According to the Greek Shipping Ministry, the questionnaires are mandatory for every travel by ship or ferry that lasts longer than 30 minutes.These questionnaires can be obtained either from travel agencies or from the shipping companies themselves, or they can be downloaded from the official website of the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy ( www.ynanp.gr ).In post #343, Yiassas has provided a link to an article where you will find at the bottom of the article links to the questionnaires. There is a slight difference in the questionnaire for domestic ferrytravel and the one for ferrytravel from Italy to Greece."
"Booked (refundable) tickets for july 8..... Hope we are not ""excluded""."
"Morning all,“ Countries with negative epidemiological characteristics will be excluded""Just so I understand, does that mean countries with lots of present / past cases?TIASanchez"
"Transavia has announced it will restart flights from Amsterdam to Athens, Thessaloniki and Heraklion from the 4th of June. If that would be true then this would be in conflict with the planning of the Greek government. I wonder if that means that people who will be buying tickets in the end will see these flights cancelled."
The absolute irony of China being on that list!
"#364,Yesterday, Transavia cancelled flights from Zakynthos and a few other Greek islands for the period 4-10 June (1st week after 3rd June) while starting flights from the mainland and other Greek islands from 4th June (Santorini included). However, this morning, I saw that Santorini was also cancelled for the period 4-10 June. So, maybe they are cancelling the flights gradually. However, in the recent past, they cancelled flights before 14 days from departure. This may not be the case this time. A few people may have bought their ""Plus"" fare which allows them multiple changes up to 14 days in advance. So, these people may have to take a call on what to do - whether wait or the flight cancellation or change the travel date (or maybe they can use the one time free rebooking till the last date, and if the flight doesn't get cancelled by then, use the one time free rebooking to book a Plus fare - not sure whether this is allowed though)."
"Yes, Roy... I agree. I think they spelled CANADA wrong!"
"I totally agree with you, Roy and Matthew Lester.Words (at least, not those permitted for use in TA forums) cannot express my feelings seeing that country included on the list. Especially since today would have been the midpoint of our spring holiday in Greece."
"As a matter of fact, the epidemiologic situation in China is good at the moment, therefore it makes sense to include it on the list. Statistical chance of the incoming person being sick is fairly low, so there's no reason to not admit them.Personally, I will make the final decision regarding my visit depending on what restrictions will be put in place by Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Flying is out of question due to the face mask requirement, so I will only be able to travel if I can do it by car."
"#367 Yiassas, I think it’s fairly obvious to most people why it’s ironic and actually leaves a pretty sour taste in the mouth."
Did have a laugh to myself when I saw China on list
"Irrespective of what one thinks about Chinese government, I don't think average Chinese traveller is to blame. There's no reason to punish (or resent) average person for acts of their government (especially when the country isn't a democracy).Edited: 10:34 am, May 21, 2020 "
The 810. do you trust the data being released by Chinese authorities?
Average British traveller isn’t to blame also ; as well as every other country
"I don't trust the data released by the UK government, if you look at the O.N.S figures when they're released every Tuesday they're way higher than the rate given on the day by the government and they're 10-12 days behind. Last Tuesday they said there were over 42.000 deaths in the UK which had Covid19 as at least 1 contribution factor, and 50.000 deaths above what we should have expected. The British government couldn't organise the proverbial brewery get together. They are so far behind on what should be happening, its nearly as bad as Trumpland.(I know most Americans think he's an idiot and treating the population of the US with disdain and is all about business opening to try and keep him in power . Rant over..I have had 1 trip cancelled(should be on Kefalonia now) and have another to the Peloponnese in September booked which may or may not happen. We LOVE the people and places of Greece and if money was no object would move their in a flash, but we have to save like most for our holidays and a healthy Greece is where we would like to go. Stay safe and Healthy peeps it is what it is and way beyond anything we can do to change the circumstances."
"Re #374: Oh goodness no, we definitely wouldn't want anyone to act against China purely out of spite -- even though acting purely out of spite is official Chinese foreign policy toward numerous western nations, most notably Canada ;)"
Maybe we stick to the topic? :) Resenting fit and healthy citizens of a nation who bring in good tourism money because of the actions of the nation's government is misplaced anger! We need to get above that. The first patient in China must be gutted for what has happened all over the world - all probably due to no fault of his / her own.
"I can't speak for others, krishansy, but in my personal case my anger is directed against the nation -- NOT against its citizens -- and so it is not misplaced. And in case you were referring to my comments, they are indeed on topic -- this thread pertains to travel to Greece in the Covid era and I shared my perspective on my inability, as a Canadian, to travel to Greece at this time. ;)"
"Donny, does your government talk about quarantine AFTER returning from another country (in this case Greece)? Maybe that's the reason why Canada is not on the list. As far as I know it's one of the parameters used by the Greek government that returning tourists should not be obliged to go in quarantine on their return home."
"Nicksy, you're spot on with that last comment. You do have to quarantine in Canada as you may have to in the UK. I say may because the travel industry will be lobbying for exemptions or a you turn on this policy. I for one think its a bit late and should have been in place from the start."

">>Australia also has a 14 day quarantine on return and even if traveling between some states but is on the list.<<Another criterion used by Greece is ""diaspora communities"". So, my guess is that Australia is on the list - despite wanting people to quarantine on return - because they have a large community of Greek decent.Criteria also used are road access and medium flight distance which explains why all Balkan countries are on the list."
Us Aussies of Greek descent will not be travelling anywhere overseas this year (NZ maybe the exception). We cant even travel within our own country...I cant even travel within my own state if it requires an overnight stay.
"Well, unfortunately for Canada as a whole, it does not seem that Ontario and Quebec have their pandemics quite under control (although they will hopefully soon), while the rest of Canada is doing very well (including relative to much of Europe).We do indeed have a 14-day quarantine requirement (something that began first here in British Columbia) for anyone (including Canadians) coming into Canada. We'll see when that changes (late Summer? Fall? who knows).We have a trip scheduled late Sept 2020 with 4 weeks in Greece in October. Working assumption is we're not going. But things can and do change!"
"Hello,I had planned to travel to Greece June 1st, and go to different islands. Leaving from the US from NY. Well as most of you had to deal with our plane was canceled and we lost allot of money to our travel agency fantasy travel. My question is I have a hotel booked in Santorini (Atlantis Hotel) I don't even know if they are open or not (tried calling and emailing), I unfortunately booked it through Hotels.com nonrefundable. Does anyone know if the ferries and hotels are open on the island? I'm trying to see if I can get a portion refund.I know everyone is losing out but hopefully we can get something.Thank you for your help!"
Doesn't sound good for your hotel money at all but maybe contact Hotels.com as this is who you booked with.
">>I unfortunately booked it through Hotels.com nonrefundable.<<Unfortunately, ""nonrefundable"" is normally what it says: no refund. I think you shouldn't have any hopes on that."
"Read on another thread somewhere that hotels.com were refunding some non refundable rooms ,might be as well to ask."
Always worth a try - you might not get anywhere but you never know...
Have seen on different threads that quite a few hotels with non-refundable bookings have been happy to amend dates to a future time. Sounds like a very fair offer.
"In my view the nonrefundable rules were meant for customers changing their minds, not the extraordinary circumstances we face now, where the choice to travel is taken out of our hands."
"#396. Thankfully, seems many proprietors feel that way too."
"Greece will reportedly conduct sample testing to flights passengers arriving in the country. Authorities are ready to restart tourism, in view of lifting the flights restrictions to Athens international airport “Eleftherios Venizelos” airport on June 15 and to all airports in the country on July 1. ""This doesn't however mean that from July 1 we will be open to everyone"" said the Deputy Minister of Civil Protection, Nikos Hardalias.The government is considering “mapping” the flights depending on daily evaluation of the epidemiological criteria in the countries the travelers come from. Categories will be colored with “red”, “orange”, “green” and “yellow”, depending on the epidemiological data of each country of origin of travelers.On this basis, flights will be selected and passengers will undergo COVID-19 testing.For example: for a country on the “green” category. sample testing will be conducted to 1-2 passengers in a total of 150 passengers. In the “yellow” category 5-10 tests, in “orange” 20-30. and in “red” all passengers of a flight.To implement this plan, as it concerns 15 airports in Greece (the ones that are receiving international flights), an equivalent number of health teams will be sent to these airports. Each team will consist of military and National Health Organization doctors, nurses and an official from the Greek Civil Protection.Tourism Minister Theoharis assured that the official lists of countries allowed or not allowed will be published shortly (before the end of May). He also said that the UK unlikely would be on the list of the first wave of countries. And uncertainty concerns also travelers from the USA and Russia as well as from Spain, Italy and France."
So the tests would be carried out in Greek airports?
"There are two important details on that EASA list:1. Those countries are not blacklisted in any way, but they have at least one airport in an area that is deemed high-risk in relation to the virus transmission.2. Not all airports in countries on that list are covered. For example, in Sweden only airports in Stockholm region are included. In Poland, it's only Katowice airport. Even in Italy and Spain it only covers some regions, while others are not considered high-risk.Full list can be found here: https:/…2013.pdf"
"Looking at the US Airports that are restricted at this time it seems pretty clear it represents all the airports with flights to Greece. (I don't think there are any direct flights from Omaha Nebraska. LOL.)We just need to wait till the US deals with the problem here at home, so we can get back to traveling abroad. Sadly, we seem to be more interested in getting a haircut then, stopping the spread."
"Katowice airport in Poland is ""blacklisted"" because there is a major outbreak in coal mines in Silesia region. Thousands of positive cases among miners and their families, vast majority completely asymptomatic and surprised to hear that they are infected as they were normally going to work throughout this epidemic (Poland is not on lockdown).Edited: 10:50 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"Where are the tests done and how long does it take, 24 hours? Are you quarantined until it comes back, these rules would be enough to put me off coming, imagine being on a red plane! Spain hasn't got these requirements."
">>Where are the tests done and how long does it take, 24 hours? <<At the airport of arrival. From 15 June at Athens airport and from 1 July also at the other airports that open for international flights.Sorry I have no idea how long it takes to get the result. I can imagine they will use ""rapid"" tests. When a positive case is detected, the passenger will be placed in quarantine and so will be his direct contacts after having been traced.Edited: 6:52 am, May 24, 2020 "
Question if someone on your flight test positive on arrival is the whole aircraft and passengers placed into quarantine As we all know aircraft aircon is used so the possibility all passengers could be infected
"No, the whole plane and all the passengers are not put in quarantine. >>As we all know aircraft aircon is used so the possibility all passengers could be infected<<In reality, the air in an airplane is very clean.On all modern aircraft, passengers and crew breathe a mixture of fresh and recirculated air. Using this combination rather than fresh air only makes it easier to regulate temperature and helps maintain a bit of humidity. The supply is bled from the compressor sections of the engines. Compressed air is very hot, but the compressors only compress; there is no contact with combustion gasses. From there it is plumbed into air conditioning units for cooling. It’s then ducted into the cabin through louvers, vents, and the eyeball gaspers above your seat. The AC units are known to pilots as “packs.” That’s an acronym for pneumatic air cycle kit. Usually there are two per plane.The air circulates until eventually it is drawn into the lower fuselage, where about half of it is vented overboard—sucked out by the pressurization outflow valve. The remaining portion is remixed with a fresh supply from the engines and run through filters, and the cycle begins again.Studies have shown that a crowded airplane is no more germ-laden than other enclosed spaces—and usually less. Those underfloor filters are of hospital quality. Between 94 and 99.9 percent of airborne microbes are captured, and there’s a total changeover of air every two or three minutes — far more frequently than occurs in offices, movie theaters, or classrooms."
"@407. That's a bit of a myth about aircraft aircon and germs. Most modern aircraft have HEPA filters which are extremely efficient and actually get more so the dirtier they get. This coupled with cabin air recycling and being mixed with fresh air from the outside every couple of minutes would result in a very low risk from the cabin air supply. The risk will be from direct contact, contaminated surfaces and people coughing and sneezing on you."

"Yes, they're both in college, so they're too old for an exception. I cancelled my tickets for late July with time running out when I could cancel our flights for free. I feel bad for the people in Greece who depend on tourism for their income. This is going to be a bad year based on the current Greek government policies."
"I agree with Bonchien, those regulations seem like too much nuissance. While I understand the reasoning behind (most of) them, I just can't see myself spending my money on holiday under such circumstances :/ The thing about leisure industry is that people will only pay if they can have a good time and being policed around and think about regulations all the time sort of wipes that out.The car thing is the most bizzare. If 4 friends go on holiday, they can't be in the same car, even if they otherwise spend all day (or even night) together. How does that make any sense?"
It’s absolute nonsense. They’ve got some much right but not this.
It seems to me that one thing Greece forgot to do is to look at all the rules and restrictions it has produced through the eyes of a tourist. I wonder how many Greeks would like to spend several thousand euros to be holidaying in such conditions? Or how would they like the idea that they may pay all that money only to be quarantined for two weeks when they arrive? In my opinion countries that cannot guarantee tourists relative normality and freedom should keep their borders shut.
"As a citizen of a small vacation town in the mountains of NH, dealing with balancing covid restrictions. I am amazed at the number of people who justify dropping medical restrictions to prevent the spread of a respiratory virus, not on science, but on the ""Thousands Of Euros"" tourist will spend.Let the citizens affected and their government set the rules and you can choose to come or not. It's not about the MONEY."
"Well said Snorkelbear! There is a small number of people on this forum who can't or won't sympathise/empathise with the way the Greek government is taking the country out of lockdown and gradually restarting the travel and tourism sector.Greece has been applauded for the measures taken to conrol the virus and protect her citizens. With only around 170 fatalities so far, it's fully understandable to most people that Greece will want to prevent Coronavirus from spreading due to a lack of diligence when visitors from other countries are allowed to enter the country.It's simply unrealistic for tourists to expect that the travel and holiday experience will be the same as they have been accustomed to in the past.For some of us on here, a lack of daily room cleaning, social distancing measures in tavernas, absence of coffee makers in rooms, restrictions in and around pools, lack of buffet breakfasts, etc, etc, would not deter us from going, if we're able to. At the end of the day, for those who are still harbouring hopes of going to Greece later this year, all that matters is this-Will Greece allow you in and will your country allow you to travel and without quarantine on your return?Will you feel safe about travelling if you can? Will you still go, in spite of the health and safety measures that Greece is implementing, especially in tourist accommodation?"
"I am a family of 4, my sons are 13 and 18. In this case the exception aplies? Do we have to take 2 taxis or rent 2 cars?"
Posts 420/421 and 422. Thank you !!!!!!!I was struggling to find the right words without being rude.Jackie
Why would you even feel the need to be rude? Because people hold different views on things? That is rather silly especially on a public forum where you are practically 100% guaranteed to find people who will not agree with you. Simply learn to ignore them.
And so say most of us !!!Glad you enjoyed your coffee outing Yiassas - it's those small things that make all the difference!
"#424. Same goes for me Jackie. I couldn’t find the right words either!!That first coffee out must have been so enjoyable Yiassas, just a small step towards some sort of normality.Edited: 3:05 pm, May 25, 2020 "
"#423. I'm unclear on the Taxi situation but for rental cars you would be able to rent just one. ""– Vehicles of up to seven seats are allowed to transport two passengers (and the driver),– Passenger limit may be exceeded in the case of families with minors.""I'm in the same situation and I'll check with my hire car company if we are luck enough to get to a pre departure state!"
"If a foreign visitor has a problem with the rules a country sets to protect their own people, well that visitor should definitely stay home. I bet that coffee tasted as never before @Yiassas."
">>If a foreign visitor has a problem with the rules a country sets to protect their own people, well that visitor should definitely stay home.<<<I'm pretty sure that those who know what restrictions are in place in Greece have already decided what they are going to do so there really is no need to lecture them. The problem is that with countries taking such a broad approach to dealing with the epidemic, most people from outside Greece do not even know what is currently allowed in Greece and what is not. The rules are not the same in all the countries. To most people open borders mean they can go there and do things the way they have always done. I predict a lot of surprised and disappointed visitors. And a lot of conflict situations.Is Greece planning to hand out leaflets to tourists on arrival about all those rules and etiquette in the shops, restaurants, museums, etc?Edited: 12:47 am, May 26, 2020 "
"I don't think anyone suggested that tourists should be extempt from rules that apply to locals. Some of us merely pointed out that going on holiday under such circumstances doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the traveller. It's not putting blame on Greece, just stating some scepticism whether this will actually help tourism to restart. At this point it seems there will be places in Europe with far more relaxed rules and naturally holiday-makers will prefer those (those who are afraid of getting sick won't travel at all)."
">> At this point it seems there will be places in Europe with far more relaxed rules and naturally holiday-makers will prefer those <<I absolutely agree with that. But on the other hand I fear that some countries that were very hard hit are relaxing things too much too soon. And for that I blame the politicians who seem to care more about economy than the health and the lives of people.It says something about people when they prefer relaxter rules in an environment with a bigger risk.Edited: 7:17 am, May 26, 2020 "
"Economy and health are linked, you can't have one without another. It's a major myth that we can sacrifice economy to save lives. Every major financial crisis brought a surge in suicides, not to mention that in order to have a good health care, you need to finance it and those money come from taxes. This chart speaks volumes: https:/…life-expectancy-vs-gdp-per-capitaIn the end of the day, it's natural that different people have different tolerance of risk - it's not like travel was risk-free before pandemic, but most of the world decided that it's worth it. These days we're facing a new risk and once again society has to decide whether this risk is high enough for us to stop living. Various societies will come to different conclusions and each traveller should respect that (that was always the case with local customs after all). For me personally, travel in 2020 is all about finding a place where people are like-minded to me and spending there as much time as possible. That way I can have a good time, without being a burden for locals.Edited: 11:54 am, May 26, 2020 "
"So i'm ever the optimist and i'm still hoping to travel to Greece at the end of August and into September. I have accommodations booked on Milos and Naxos from September 4 - 16th and need to book two ferries. A lot of websites say you need to book at least 2 months in advance to ensure you get on the one want, however many of the ferries are not offering refunds for tickets purchased, only credits from 12 - 18 months. Credits don't work if you live internationally and are not travelling again to Europe within the time frame the credit is valid. Has anyone heard anything different, or is there a specific ferry company offering refunds if you can't get to Greece? Perhaps it's too soon to think about but wanted to see if anyone on the ground in Greece would know?"
@436 Clearly 2020 will be quite different but normally advance booking is not required except on the holiday weekends. That might be a bit different given they will not be operating with full capacity. I would just wait...too many uncertainties this year.
"It’s not necessary to book ferries in advance unless you are travelling around the August 15th national holiday. In early September sometimes ferries are full going back to Athens, but you can wait until you are in Greece to buy tickets. I’ve often travelled that time of year and never prebook."
>>A lot of websites say you need to book at least 2 months in advance to ensure you get on the one want<<A lot of websites are wrong saying that. I always go in September and have never booked a ferry in advance.
"The current FCO advice is simply don't travel. But the details on what faces travellers in Greece seems to be out of date. https:/…entry-requirementsNo mention of the ban on UK incoming flights.All arrivals will be tested.14 days isolation if negative, quarantine in government approved facilities if positive."
"There was a report on the ITV News last night about how Greece intends to do everything it can to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 on the islands, even though they admitted some cases are likely if they allow tourists to visit.They were also saying Greece is one of the best prepared major tourist destinations to allow tourists to return and depending how well Greece copes might depend whether or not holidays to other countries in Europe are possible this year.It ended with them stressing at the moment that British people cannot go on holiday to Greece as things stand and that Greece will want to see a decline in British cases of COVID-19 before that changes."
"TUI's cancellation terms are very poor. Even under normal circumstances they can cancel your holiday the day before you intend to travel and then the maximum compensation you can get is £100 per adult (in addition to the cancelled holiday cost.) £100 won't get you far if you've pre-booked extras not through TUI.The problem all airlines and travel companies have is the UK restrictions do not have a specific end date. Although, as UK hotels are unable to reopen until at least July we can be pretty sure international travel for leisure won't resume before then."
"Patricia P The Greek Government are saying where the flights can come in from. If the UK isn't on the list, then flights can't come in from there.It's not a matter of a ban on UK flights, they just won't be able to come yet."
"Thanks all appreciate the advice....Edited: 9:36 am, May 27, 2020 "
Hi just a quick question. Would it be a ban on nationality or a ban on countries for flights into Athens? I live on the border with Germany and could quite easily travel to a German airport if my country (Netherlands) is on the no fly list. I am however a British citizen. Thanks
"#445What do you mean ""Covid-19 screening ""? Is it temperature tests?I'm planning o to go to Sikinos, meaning propably risk level C, and I would like to know what it means?Also, Kea and Kythnos, with direct conections to Athens (Lavrion or Pireus) woud be level A or B?Thanks"
This is all so confusing. What is the status on dual national permanent residents of the United States who have European citizenship as well as American. Can they come in to Greece now?
This article from the Greek Reporter lists current travel information for Greece. https:/…
I have the same question. I am from Belgium. The Netherlands and Belgium are not in the list of 20 countries. It is very likely however that we can travel to Germany as from 15. June. Can we take a flight from Germany to Athens or will they ban you based on your nationality?I have the same question for ferries from Italy to Greece.Thank you
"I think that is the decision will be made on 15 june, all internal EU borders Will open. Or at least a timeframe will be given for all countries to gradually open up.By EU law, discrimination based on nationality is Forbidden, so they're eager for a coherent approach and opening"
"Thanks Yiassas. Yes, it was wrongly formulated by me. It is about residence and not nationality. So I understand that an Italian living in Germany will be allowed in, but an Italian living in Italy not. And you think that will be thoroughly checked everywhere?"
"Depending on Greece's definition of ""residence"" it may not be possible to check it at all as EU/EEA/Swiss nationals are allowed to move freely without having to notify national authorities unless they stay somewhere longer than a specified amount of time and that may differ from country to country. In Poland for example it's 30 days stay at one address but as far as I know it's not being policed. And also Polish ID cards do not have any addresses on them that could prove residence. So on the basis on official travel documents I can prove that I'm Polish but can't prove that I live in Poland. I checked other national ID cards and several more countries do not have residence addresses on them either. Not sure if any country put residence addresses on their passports. I think not.Checking residence status would require upholding proper passport controls as neither airline nor airport staff have access to residence databases. EU/EEA/Swiss nationals travel solely on the basis of their nationality as proved by their passports and national ID cards. They do not have to prove residence. Any residence requirement would make flights to Greece Non-Schengen flights or require passengers to carry some extra documents as proof of residence. I'm not sure other countries will agree to that."
">>>What do you mean ""Covid-19 screening ""? Is it temperature tests?I think that in terms of entry into Greece that wording means RT-PCR tests which can take from 2 hours if done immediately after collecting samples at the lab, up to several days . Sounds like a lot of fun unless the ""floating EODY medical units"" are genetic labs. I suppose visitors will not be let loose on these islands while waiting for the results?"
"Ah, there is another thing people from outside Greece do not probably know about. I just had a look at the form ferry passengers are required to fill out before boarding and my understanding is that health care workers or anyone else coming into contact with infected persons are effectively banned from travelling on ferries unless they lie on the form. I'm not sure if Greek officials are aware that rules for testing and/or quarantine are different across Europe so it's perfectly possible for people in other countries to have close contact with infected persons within the last 14 days and not be quarantined meaning their movement (travel) rights are not restricted in any way. They will be free to travel to Greece but then can't get on a ferry?Edited: 2:26 am, May 28, 2020 "

"Interesting and informative video, AA. Thank you!"
"That's why I mentioned lying, Absolutely Athens. Responsible individuals are banned from travelling on ferries but irresponsible ones can get on no problem... Excellent news for the irresponsible ones!From that video it seems that the Greek medical units are not exactly floating medical units. They are guys on speedboats whizzing through the Aegean collecting samples and then delivering them somewhere else.We still do not know what is going to happen if someone wants to visit one of these high risk islands. Will the guys on speedboats go in windy seas? What happens if they won't? How long will waiting for the results take now that we know that the floating units are not genetic labs? What will happen to these visitors while they are waiting for the results? What if the results come back positive or inconclusive? Will the visitors require repeat testing if they want to visit several high risk islands or does it mean that island hopping is out of the question this year?"
"What does this mean for you?As this is a truly extraordinary situation we understand that you may not be able to think about your next holiday at the moment. We're therefore offering you a refund credit for your holiday impacted by COVID-19. Your refund credit will apply to everything you paid for when you first booked your package holiday. And, as a thank you for being a valued customer we would like to give you up to an extra 20% on us, as a separate booking incentive to help you find your next package holiday. For example, if you have a booking for £2,000 you will now have £2,400 to spend.Because you booked a package holiday, your refund credit will carry the same ATOL protection as your original holiday booking. You can therefore be confident that you have financial security. It's important to note that the separate booking incentive isn't financially protected.TUI EMAIL TODAYEdited: 8:21 am, May 28, 2020 "
"UK reporters from both the BBC and ITV were with the medics on the speedboats on Milos and Kimolos.

"That is not what this article says: https:/…""In the event of a passenger finding that, based on the questionnaire, they either show symptoms or have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient in any way during the last 14 days, boarding will not be allowed, the ministry said in the guidelines statement."""
"Regarding TUI posts - legally TUI have to refund you if they've cancelled your holiday but if TUI give everyone refunds and don't have any new bookings that will create a cash flow problem for them, so they want you to think you're better off by taking a voucher worth 120% of the cost of your holiday then you are by getting a 100% refund."
"It's to late to edit, but I want to add that based on what that guy said in the video posted by Spekka about detaining every contact of each coronavirus case, the article seems to be correct. These questions on the form are not there for nothing.As to what the Kimolos doctors says about tourists bringing coronavirus to the island - well, that's absolutely obvious to anyone who is aware that there are loads of people infected but totally without symptoms. They are avoiding detection unless the RT-PCR test is used as a screening tool to test absolutely everybody and not only random ones or those that show symptoms or say that they had contact with someone who has covid19. Asymptomatic people are not as infectious as those that are coughing and sneezing but still there is potential for one of them infecting someone elderly and vulnerable on the island."

>>I was under the impression that there was currently a ban on travel from the UK to Greece?<<And you are correct in that.In fact it's misleading advertising from Wizz Air as they will not be allowed to fly to Athens from London next week. And it remains that way until at least 15 June. Even that is a date that won't stand. I'd be surprised if any company will be allowed to fly from the UK to Greece before 1 July.It's just a way to lure people in buying tickets to get money in the pocket of the company. You can book but you can't fly and (most probably) they will then give you a voucher. That way you are tied to book a flight with them in the future.

Presumably, a large majority of these visitors will be hoping to go to various different islands around Greece, not just Athens and Thesaloniki, which kind of nullifies any package tour holiday flights.If (and when) the UK are permitted to fly in, the vast majority of people will also want to fly direct to a specific island, not to Athens or Thessaloniki . It will be Interesting to see if the next group of countries that are permitted to enter the country (regardless of wether the UK is one of them) also have the only Athens or Thesaloniki restriction."
I'm sorry. It is still not clear for me. Can a Belgian living in Belgium or a Frenchman living in France take a flight from Germany or Switzerland to Greece or not (on 15. June or later that month)?
"The chances are you would be at the mercy of the airline. They would have the right to refuse you boarding any flight (regardless of where you board the plane) because if you were refused entry into Greece, you would become their responsibility and they would have to fly you back to where you started from."
">>any news about the ferries from Italy to Greece? Are German and Austrian tourists allowed on these ferries?<<As it seems it's not the nationaly that's taken in account but the origin from where the plane leaves. And Italy is not on the list, so I assume this goes for the ferry too. Currently they are only taken freight anyway.Besides that, Austrian tourists won't be able to take a ferry from Italy as the Austrian-Italian border remains closed. >>Can a Belgian living in Belgium take a flight from Germany or Switzerland to Greece or not <<For the moment no. It depends on the date the Belgian government will lift the regulation that allows travel to another country. If they allow travel to Germany by 15 June, it means that in theory you could fly from there to Athens or Thessaloniki.IMO, the Greek government has taken a bad decision by adding that sentence that it's the origin of the flight that is important and not the nationality of the tourist."
Citizens are not issued residency cards.
"What I meant is that if people were to be allowed into Greece based on residency, citizens of a given country would not be able to fly without extra documentation as national ID cards in many countries do not state residence address. Some have no national ID cards at all. How do UK citizens prove that they are resident in the UK? Restricting access based on residence would cause more problems than simply restricting flights based on their origin."
"What is the correct translation of the below? I think here they say how they will control it?Στους επισκέπτες από τις χώρες αυτές θα πραγματοποιείται δειγματοληπτικός έλεγχος, ενώ για όλες τις υπόλοιπες εξακολουθούν να ισχύουν οι υπάρχοντες κανόνες, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι οι επισκέπτες από άλλες χώρες, εκτός λίστας, εφόσον έρθουν, θα μπούν σε 14ημερη «καραντίνα». «Δεν θα είχε νόημα αλλιώς η λίστα των 29 χωρών που πληρούν τα επιδημιολογικά κριτήρια γιατί αλλιώς oι ταξιδιώτες από άλλες χώρες θα μπορούσαν να χρησιμοποιήσουν μεγάλα αεροδρόμια, όπως για παράδειγμα τη Φρανκφούρτη, ως ενδιάμεσα, για να εισέλθουν στη χώρα», διευκρινίζουν από το υπουργείο Τουρισμού. O έλεγχος στα δύο αεροδρόμια σε Αθήνα και Θεσσαλονίκη, όπου απελευθερώνονται οι πτήσεις στις 15/6, για την χώρα προέλευσης του επισκέπτη θα γίνεται βάσει του διαβατηρίου δεδομένου ότι δεν μπορεί να ελεγχθεί με αξιοπιστία ο τόπος διαμονής του.Source: https:/…"
#481The restriction of international flights (from permitted countries) into only Athens and Thessaloniki airports gets lifted on 1 July 2020. It's already been confirmed that from then onwards direct international flights (from permitted countries) will also be allowed to all other remaining airports.
"""Besides that, Austrian tourists won't be able to take a ferry from Italy as the Austrian-Italian border remains closed."" - I believe Italy plans to open their borders on Wednesday. Austria plans to keep the border closed on their side but that doesn't prevent Austrians from leaving (or even coming back, subject to a test or quarantine)."
"I have not been watching the situation in all the countries but I don't think there is a ban on people leaving a country anywhere in Europe, at least no by land. There are no exit controls on the land borders - you can leave but which country you can go to depends on the entry requirements of that country. Even Belgium is no exception - you can leave but there is 250EUR fine if you can't prove that your trip was ""essential"" when you come back. One poster on the Polish forums posted her pretty recent experience - she drove from Belgium to Germany to pick up a member of her family from there. No exit checks whatsoever at Belgium border but a lot of questions asked when coming back."
"I think Czechia had exit restrictions for a short time, but that was an exception. Vast majority of EU countries never prevented anyone from leaving - it wouldn't make much sense anyway, why would you care if someone goes away? What matters is who gets in, not who goes out. Not to mention it would be grossly unconstitutional in most places.Edited: 4:10 am, May 30, 2020 "
<>Vast majority of EU countries never prevented anyone from leaving<<You will be surprised when you see the regulations and travel advice on the government websites of the different countries.
"Advising against travel is different from banning travel. While most, if not all, EU states did advise against non-essential travel abroad, vast majority of them had no legal restrictions on leaving.Edited: 4:58 am, May 30, 2020 "
"Nicksy, of course but those regulations are for those who want to enter, not those who want to leave. Government travel advice is only that - travel advice. If you decide you want to take the risk, you are free to ignore it.Edited: 5:03 am, May 30, 2020 "
"Phytochemical: this is from the Belgian government.""In the context of the corona crisis, the Belgian government decided to PROHIBIT all non-essential travel abroad until 7 June. The National Security Council will re-evaluate this ban in a timely manner.From Saturday 30 May, it is permitted to visit family members living in a neighboring country (Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands) and to travel to these countries to make purchases, provided that the measures in force in the country concerned are observed. Indeed, France still does not allow travel for purchases other than basic needs.""And that is not advise from the government but put into law(s)."
"OK, perhaps we in Central/Eastern Europe do not even realize how crazy things are in some Western European countries."
"Nicksy: I think it's understood from the thread that Belgian restriction is legally enforcable, but it's very rare in Europe. Most countries don't care if you leave (why would they after all?), but governments warn that you might get stuck abroad and they may not be able to help."
"What exactly is the situation with Greek land borders? All I a hearing about are flights. Are they completely closed, open for essential travel only or open to everyone but with mandatory 2-week quarantine? Are they opening borders with Bulgaria, Macedonia on June 15? Thanks."
"#502 It doesn’t make sense to me that the Greek government is relying on the EASA list of airports - rather than doing restrictions by country.The link says:“ Q: What will change on 15 June 2020?A: 15 June inaugurates the gradual return to normalcy. Compulsory testing and quarantine will be limited only to travelers, irrespective of nationality, arriving from airports of affected areas with high risk of transmission of the Covid-19 infection, as assessed by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The list is constantly updated and travelers should check before traveling (https:/…group-easa-downloads). All other travelers will enter restriction-free and may be subject to random tests upon arrival.“In theory, EasyJet could restart flights from Bristol to Athens, but what’s to stop people who would normally travel from London Heathrow (which is on the list) driving the extra 100m/160km and taking the operating flight?The southwest of England has been affected far less than many other parts of the country (and I hope it stays that way), but I can’t see this being any safer for Greece than allowing flights from London as well.I wish flights out of Bristol would restart, but only when it’s safe for them to do so."
"Making decisions based on the EASA list is indeed silly. I wonder if anyone had a look at the map. For example, in Poland the blacklisted airport is Katowice which is 1 hr drive from another large airport - Kraków Airport (not blacklisted) and 2hr drive from Wrocław Airport (not blacklisted). These are not large distances for those who are determined to fly. All of these three airports have flights to Athens and other regions of Greece. People in that region generally choose an airport based on where they want to go and flight times. They are not tied to one airport just because that is supposed to be their regional airport."
"This is exactly the scenario generally feared, i.e., that those determined to travel will drive first to an ‘acceptable’ airport to do so, with little consideration for what invisible killer they might carry with them. I fear for Greece, truly. I think a few countries are on the brink right now opening up to tourists. The coming period will indeed be a very risky one. I shall be praying Greece retains its almost Covid-free state.Edited: 12:56 am, June 01, 2020 "
"It's not possible to maintain covid-free status unless a place is totally isolated and nothing and no one gets in. Probably for several years. Letting in tourists will inevitably bring the virus not even though any malicious actions on behalf of the visitors - loads of people do not even know they are infected because they have no symptoms and are unlikely to be tested. Random tests on arrival may detect some but not all. So a spike is almost guaranteed. It will be interesting to watch what Greece does then. Personally I can put up with social distancing, face masks, increased hygiene/disinfection but random tests, quarantine and the risk of sudden lockdown is a deal breaker. I'm grateful to Aegean that they put me of out my dilemma by cancelling my flights.In terms of fatality, it depends on how susceptible the Greek population is and whether the Greek health system is able to cope. Covid fatality rate is vastly different across countries depending on many factors. No only that - in many countries there are no excess deaths statistically. When you look at total deaths (total deaths in case anyone dies undiagnosed) you see no invisible killer. At least not this year. In Poland the total death rate in March&April 2020 was about four thousand deaths LESS than in the same period of 2018 and a few hundred less than in 2019. One might even say that the coronavirus is saving lives.Edited: 3:17 am, June 01, 2020 "
"Yes, the use of the word ‘almost’ was very deliberate. Agree with all your observations. Indeed, I will be watching closely over the coming (trial?) period, hoping for the very best possible outcome."
"People who expect infections to drop to zero will have to stay at home for the rest of their lives. That is simply not gonna happen, the virus is not gonna dissapear in foreseeable future.What we needed to do was to flatten the curve. Now it's time to return to our lifes and accept that some risks exist, as has always been the case. Otherwise we're headed towards creating far bigger problems than the virus.Last week, I travelled for the first time in over 2 months. In my destination, people were out in streets enjoying summer, bars were bustling... it felt like good old days and for most purposes it was business as usual. Despite that, there doesn't seem to be any major surge in cases. It filled me with some optimism that we will return to the ""old normal"" soon. Ultimately, people want to live. Accepting short-term restrictions is one thing, but humans are not going to give up their needs forever."
"This is all very confusing. Is Greece now allowing the United States in as of June 15th? If you are coming in from a certain state you have to be quarantined? So I will be fling in from Illinois but I live in WI. Il is on the list but WI isnt. But then again I dont fly in until Sept, so who knows what's going to change again"
">>Is Greece now allowing the United States in as of June 15th? <<That has not been decided yet. Last Wednesday the Greek Prime Minister Mitsotakis said that the United States is probably set to be left off the list of countries allowed to resume direct flights to Greece on June 15 and July 1, but it could be added later in the summer."
"Nicksy, there is new information out.https:/…June 15 – June 30: U.S. citizens are permitted to enter Greece subject to COVID-19 testing and quarantine restrictions depending on where your travel originated. *See Quarantine Information below.*However, I won't go if I have to adhere to a 7 day quarantee. Hope this changes. I'm not flying out till September, so who knows what will happen by then"
"Exactly. Most working people will be able to take perhaps 1 or 2 weeks off for a holiday, so even if they are allowed to enter it would be pointless only to be quarantined for 7 (or even 14) days."
"For US citizens it would be a waste of time and money if you have to stay quarantined for 7 or more days upon arrival in Athens even if you are negative.Still hoping things will change by my Oct. flight.However, I have until Aug. 31 to either re-book or get a refund on my flight so any decision by the Greek government has to occur prior to that date.If I hold off making a decision after Aug 31 may not be able to re-book or get refund if things don't improve.More waiting but at least there may be a chance something good happens for US citizens.Edited: 9:04 am, June 01, 2020 "
"Or I can see if I can cancel my flight that leaves from IL, which is on the list, and fly out from WI, which is not on the list. But I got such an inexpensive flight I hate to do that. I just hope by Sept, US will be able to come in with no restrictions."
"Nope I won't go if I have to self isolate. That's why, to me, this is dumb. Chicago airport is only an hour away. from Milwaukee airport . But Chicago is in IL and Milwaukee is in WI. IL is on the quarantee list and WI isn't. I guess I should have booked out of Milwaukee."
"Absolutely pointless for the vast majority of people if they are being allowed in ONLY to then be quarantined for 7 days on a negative test (or 14 on a positive test). For a lot of people this will be the duration of their entire holiday. This is precisely why people will be looking at loopholes and possible re-routing to avoid this.I think Greece will have to give this one some thought.Edited: 12:51 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"I'm flying with Swiss Airlines which will be allowed to/from Greece via USA.However, the state I'm flying out of, Massachusetts, is on the list of airports not being allowed in to Greece!I'll keep waiting until the last minute before having to make a decision."

https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g189…Posted this yesterday Nicksy and yet some people still think it's not a problem!
That's 13% of the flight - not good at all! It will be really interesting to see how many of the 79 who tested negative turn positive over the 7 days of monitoring - please could you share if and when this gets published.
Good point Paul. Equally maybe some of the negative tested might actually be positive.
This is a real test case for Greece. Will be interesting to see how things unfold and how it impacts on future policy.
"I think these passengers were aware of the mandatory tests and consequences of testing positive. They all seem to be either Greek residents or have family ties to Greece so the quarantine may not be such a problem for them. Wait till real holidaymakers arrive, test positive and then discover TripAdvisor to voice their dissatisfaction. Some people may have read the small print that Greece is planning to do random tests on ALL international arrivals but they may not immediately realise that that a positive result means mandatory quarantine. It's not always clear in media posting enthusiastic news that ""Greece is welcoming the world""""12 of them were tested positive. Nine of them are Pakistani nationals from the city of Ghouhrat, with residence permission in Greece. Two are Greek nationals coming form Australia and one is a Japanese national, member of a Greek-Japanese family, media reported citing the press release issued by the Greek Health Authorities.""https:/…"
"Yes, I’d read the article and duly noted that those affected were not your average tourists but more likely people returning home. There is much to yet unfold. Challenging times ahead indeed."

"I had EasyJet flights booked for the end of June to attend a sporting event in Poland. The event has been cancelled and I have now changed the flights to Athens for 17th August. I have only done this as I can change again as many times as I like without incurring any costs. I live in hope that all will be well and travel will be allowed, but I also have the dilemma of should I really be travelling."

"Hi everyoneThis thread is so long now that I should've made a note of where I remember seeing a post that said that Wizzair would simply not be allowed to fly into Greece from UK during June. A recent post indicates that this is not the case now, because I believe Greece has said that they will now accept passengers from countries with a high number of Covid cases, but that quarantine will apply. I had been thinking that my Wizzair flight on 23 June Luton-Athens would be cancelled so I could have a refund, but is it likely now that the flight will go ahead?? Unfortunately, we were going to Milos on an Aegean flight out of Athens the same day, and I'm fairly sure that we will have to cancel that one-way flight and lose the money. Aegean have stopped sending me texts/emails now saying I can change the flight at no extra cost! Thanks for any advice.Tessa"
"Unfortunately Yiassas, we can't change our flight dates because we had booked for 2 weeks off work, and our employers won't allow changes to be made to holiday dates booked, otherwise everyone will cancel their dates and want to rebook when (if!) overseas holidays resume. To be honest, even if we could change our dates, we wouldn't know what to change them to, because the UK Government have now said we'll have to quarantine when we return from overseas, and we don't know how long that rule will go on for. We're already booked for Croatia at the end of September - sadly, we got ourselves very organised this year and booked all our holidays a bit further in advance than we usually do....."
"From the official message from the Greek authorities: https:/…greece-welcomes-the-world.html15 June to 30 JuneInternational flights are allowed into Athens and Thessaloniki airports.If you originate from an airport on the EASA affected area list (and Luton is currently on that list), then you will be tested upon arrival. An overnight stay at a designated hotel is required. If the test is negative then the passenger self-quarantines for 7 days. If the test is positive, the passenger is quarantined under supervision for 14 days.EASA list: https:/…group-easa-downloads-------That means that even if you can fly in from Luton, you will not be able to take that domestic flight to Milos as you have to stay overnight waiting for the result of the test.For your Athens-Milos flight, see the ""About rebooking"" section on https://en.aegeanair.com/aegean-announcement/Rebooking is still without rebooking fee regardless date of booking and date of flight, it seems. Allthough a possible fare difference applies."
"Thank you Nicksy - the links you've given were (as always) very helpful. And thank you for your tip, 123twinkletoes - I hadn't ever thought to click on the heart (even though it says 'save'!!) - I will definitely be making a lot more use of that in the future. We have a local pub who are currently able to deliver a home-made Kleftiko, Stifado, or Moussaka, along with a Greek salad, so I'll be buying ouzo from the supermarket, and we'll hope the sun comes out again (currently raining), so we can pretend we're on a Greek island at the end of this month rather than sitting in our own garden!Yiamas!Tessa"
"I have a flight booked for entry into Crete at the end of July from the UK and returning in August. It looks like the flight in July will be cancelled, but I have the option to change to a flight 2 days earlier or 2 days later which are still scheduled to operate. My concern is, what entry quarantine will be in place in Crete at the end of July. If I change my flight arrangements and they go ahead, I may face 7-14 days in quarantine in Greece. Obviously this would not be any good for a 2 week holiday. However if I leave my flights as they are, they will be cancelled, and I will get a refund, but have the disappointment of not travelling to Crete this year. I also face cancellation charges and losses of deposits for hotel, car hire, transfers and parking for a cancellation. What would other people do in this situation?"
"#549. Hi. Have a read of this, it’s the protocols that will be in place in the hotels and might help you to decide if this is what you want from your holiday. Personally, I think the quarantine measures you describe will stay in place because cases of the virus will undoubtedly be picked up through testing on some of the new arrivals once tourist numbers increase.https:/…I’d be calculating my losses if I cancelled (don’t give up on asking for credits or vouchers) against the overall cost of the holiday, including spends, and also a week self-isolating. Good luck, not an easy time just now.Edited: 4:34 am, June 07, 2020 "
Thank you 123twinkletoes. The protocols put in place at the hotels etc do not really concern me and would only slightly limit the enjoyment of the holiday. The big thing that I could not manage is the possibility of 7-14 quarantine in Greece. I could even cope with the self quarantine imposed by the UK. Hopefully the rise in tourists will not mean a rise in cases for Greece.
A very timely posting Yiassas. Thank you. Was my worry too.
"Very sensible decision Yiassas. Further easing of restrictions is to come shortly.....way too soon. We are heavily risking a second peak.Edited: 5:57 am, June 07, 2020 "
It looks like there is no guarantee that some infected tourists will arrive in Greece without knowing they have the virus. Unless everyone is tested upon arrival at an airport the virus infection rate could go up.The only way to guarantee one doesn't have the virus is a vaccine but that is not expected for many months or longer!My flight is scheduled for Sept. 30 from the US (Boston) to Athens if Greece will even allow tourists from America.Still holding out hope I along with many others can come to Greece but Greece must do what's best for it's people and economy first.
"The more I read about all of this, the more I'm thinking of postponing my Sept trip to next Sept. I sure hate to wait another 15 months though. Just have to wait and see what happens. I did get confirmation from the place I'm staying in Paros that they will give me a voucher if I decide to postpone. This was a nonrefundable. It is Blue Mare Villas. I am hoping my airlines will also give me a voucher along with my other two accommodations."
"@549, I would take the losses. Being quarantined for 7 to 14 days and not even be able to go outside if not my idea of a fun trip. Especially coming from the United States and a 12 hour plane ride.Even if there is an inkling of a chance I would be randomly selected to be tested and have to be quarantined for 7 days, I would not come. I would wait until next year.Edited: 12:09 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"I'm thinking more and more that my Oct. trip may not happen. I still have time to make a decision by Aug. 31 about re-booking my flight or getting a refund so there is time that things may improveHowever, the virus isn't going to disappear and as more and more people think it's safe to go out and/or countries start to open up more of their businesses, events and places of worship it's likely the virus will once again spread more rapidly.We need that vaccine ASAP!"
"@560, yes I could come any time of the year. The only reason I picked September is that the sea in warm enough to swim in and we also like swimming in the outdoor pools. I would be a bummer to be vacationing in Sept and all of a sudden Greece went into full lockdown or the US did and couldn't get home. I also contacted my stay in Santorini and they also said they would give me a voucher. So that's two down that I won't lose money on.CrazyH, I agree, we do need that vaccine.Edited: 1:45 pm, June 07, 2020 "
I will make my final decision by Aug 15th. That will be one month before I fly out.
"The highlight of my year is my annual trip to Greece. I put a lot of time and research into my trip which I not only find enjoyable but educational.The more I travel to Greece the more I want to return and discover new parts of the country.I am fortunate that I can go every year but missing a year will be a major disappointment.However, Greece has to do what's best for the country and it's people.The last thing I want to do is bring a virus over even if I don't have the symptoms and caused more problems.Greece has been though enough with its economy but I am very happy and proud that Greece has done one of the best jobs in handling the virus. Far better than my own country and others that consider themselves ""better"" than Greece.Some times I wonder about that!"
"Greece’s health authorities have been set on alert and government politicians threaten with “local lockdown” in islands and touristic areas, should crowding phenomena like the one at a Mykonos beach bar occur again.Referring to Greece’s immediate response after 12 passengers on a Qatar Airlines flights were tested positive, the government spokesman said “we will do the same locally if we see a problem somewhere, whether it’s in a neighborhood or a health facility or a school. It may even concern a geographical area, an island or a prefecture. Everything is on the table."
"I think those two statements should be enough for everyone to not consider coming this year. This is what scares me most about travel this year - being in a foreign place, far from home and local government going into a knee-jerk reaction. Thanks but no thanks. I will only travel to places where I believe I can rely on certain level of stability in terms of restrictions or places which I can easily leave if things go wrong."
"I heard about the increase in cases, many of them from travelers who flew in from abroad!I wonder if those travelers were tested or checked out before their flights.It may be those other countries that aren't doing their job of testing passengers before their flights.This doesn't bode well for future travel from other countries into Greece.I'm still hoping things will get better before I have to decide on whether to rebook or cancel my flight by Aug 31 for my Sept. 30 flight.I'll hold out as long as possible and keep tabs on the latest info but it's looking more and more that travel to Greece will be limited and/or restricted to certain countries with more rigid testing as people arrive in Greece.What a bummer if you land in Greece and they find out you have the virus and end up quarantined for 14 days, probably the larger part of your vacation time!Edited: 4:55 pm, June 08, 2020 "
">>What a bummer if you land in Greece and they find out you have the virus and end up quarantined for 14 days, probably the larger part of your vacation time!<<I have no idea why any regular tourist would risk it, but it seems to me people are."
"#570. And an even bigger bummer for the residents of Greece if the virus creeps in and takes a hold!! Also, you might not just be quarantined if found positive, you could become very ill and hospitalised. Now that really would be a bummer. I’m sure you’ll think hard before undertaking this journey (if travel is permitted). There’s a lot at risk for sure.Edited: 5:37 pm, June 08, 2020 "
I'm an eternal optimist but my optimism is starting to waver!If not this year there's always next year . . . I hope!
Has there been a comment / reaction from the government on the increase in cases ?
"30 cases of the 97 refer to travelers who came from abroad and 29 to residents of the regional unit of Xanthi, in north-eastern Greece.5 of the new confirmed cases have been detected in Kozani, western Macedonia. Among them is a military officer who was previous in Preveza, western Epirus, and a couple that drove Greece from the Czech Republic.Other new cases have been detected in Thiva, Tripoli and Lamia, where a 86-year-old man and his grandson recently returned form the USA and the grandson broke the quarantine."
Thanks as ever for keeping us posted.
Been reading as this unfolds...Greece goes from a good example of handling and containing the virus to opening up for full on tourism and now risks becoming the poster country for failed reopening. The past holiday weekend was a preview of July and August.I was sort of hoping that there might be some scientific basis for thinking it was not as virulent in warmer months but that theory seems to be not holding. My concern is not the holidaymakers who had to have that vacation this year but the Greeks who are in that business (many older) and the impact on them. Social distancing and wearing masks seem to work but are just not really part of a fun summer holiday in Greece.
"#579 I think 'poster country for failed reopening' might be overstating the situation. Nicksy's post #575 says only 30 cases originated in foreign visitors. Surely the authorities know of these because their measures at the point of entry captured them?The remaining ones seem to be regional flare-ups that will be bound to happen anywhere that eases contact restrictions in the middle of a pandemic.It's how the Greek government reacts if/when a relaxation of arrival controls on visitors leads to outbreaks and some areas need to be 'locked-down' that will be the ultimate measure of its success at managing the virus.Consequently, anyone planning a visit to Greece needs to recognise that it might last longer than expected, might involve staying indoors for a long period, and will certainly be less free-and-easy than usual."
"Bernard, I too was wondering about the 30. I am aware that some flights have been going into Greece all along, but have the tests been carried out all through?I saw today that there is only a slight chance that asymptomatic Covid 'sufferers ' can actually pass the virus on to other people. Many people may have it with no idea of any kind of symptoms but then when they are tested - bingo!"
"Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias announced on today, during a joint press conference with his Italian counterpart, that Greece will lift any restrictions as from next Monday and gradually until the end of the month for tourists from Italy, Personally, I think that is a big risk they take given the fact that Italy was 1 of the countries in Europe that was hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic."
"#581. You are so right there KK. My cousin is taking part in a UK countrywide survey at the moment. Seems anything like 8,500+ new cases are still being found daily amongst the general populous, who clearly aren’t unwell, otherwise they’d already be getting tested elsewhere. I do also wonder whether we are now developing some degree of herd immunity since, thankfully, hospital admissions continue to drop.I do know one thing, I am extremely concerned for Greece, what happens when the country moves to only random testing from 1st July? And the borders to many will have been opened by then. I think there might have to be some policy changes if new cases increase dramatically. Letting Italian holidaymakers visit will be a trial run and highlight the number of cases still out there.Edited: 2:31 pm, June 09, 2020 "
"I hope Greece doesn't go from being one of the best countries to handle the virus to another that can only think of the economy as being more important than the countries' citizens well-being.Here in the US many states are opening up and easing restrictions and we are seeing an increase in infections in states that won't affected as much before. The virus is now spreading to many rural states after many of them opened up businesses, gatherings, events, etc. because they weren't affected like the states and/or cities with high populations like New York.Don't count your chickens before they hatch!The health, well-being and safety of your country's citizens are more important than the Almighty dollar!And this is from someone who goes to Greece every year and will be very disappointed if I can't go this year but will understand if Greece says no to the US or other highly-infected countries!Edited: 4:25 pm, June 09, 2020 "
What I don't understand is why Greece is stating that Covid negatives have to quarantine for 7 days. What does that do. I f you are negative you aren't going to spread it. I think they should change that.
"I have watched with horror a video that showed what happened in this beach bar on Mykonos. Great that the Greek authorities immediately gave the owner a big fine and closed the place for quite a while. If that's a preview of what the behavior of especially young tourists will be on islands like Mykonos, Paros, Ios, Kos and Santorini, I fear that Greece will get a huge second wave. I am still hoping that we will be able to go to our beloved Ios island in September or October. Fingers crossed that Greece will stay in control of the virus, but I have to say: I am rather pessimistic."
">>>What I don't understand is why Greece is stating that Covid negatives have to quarantine for 7 days. What does that do. I f you are negative you aren't going to spread it. I think they should change that.There is some rationale behind that because if the RT-PCR test is done too early it will be negative. For example, if you pick up the virus a day or two before your trip, the test in Greece is not going to show it. By asking people to quarantine for 7 days they hope they may develop symptoms so it becomes clearer whether they are infected or not. They can then be be retested."
"Is there any news regarding the passengers on the Qatar flight who tested negative, as they must have done their 7 days isolation by now ?"
"@586, Harry L, it's not just the youths in the video you talked about that are a concern. That story appears on the link below, but if you scroll down the page on that link, you'll see hoards of people, including well-to-do-types, clergy, reporters and onlookers huddled together at the unveiling of a new statue in Piraeus. Who's going to bust them?https:/…That's preposterous!"
"I agree that travelers who are flying from another country into Greece should be tested. However, what about people who drive into the country? Can they be tested at borders?Better yet before anyone is flying into Greece they should be tested before the flight that will save everyone a lot of misery, especially if you get tested in Greece and found to have the infection and end up quarantined for better part of your trip.No easy way out of this until there is a vaccine but testing is the best option for now."
"#592The Greek authorities have (currently) decided that someone who tests negative on arrival should still isolate for 7 days. Surely that means it would be possible to test negative before a flight but then test positive in the next couple of days (after arriving at destination)? I think this is why the idea of 'health passports' was quickly ruled-out as being unworkable.Greece is proposing is that a random number of travellers will be tested on entry and quarantined if positive but there's no statement (at least none that I've seen) on what happens to all the others on a flight where one passenger tests positive or whether samples will be taken from every flight.I can't see that all passengers on a plane will be held until the results of a few are ready (though perhaps they should), so by the time results are known, other passengers could have spread far and wide.I mentioned elsewhere that the islands of Paros and Antiparos have invested in testing machines that can generate a result in 45 minutes, but surely these will only be of use in testing a symptomatic person so that they and their contacts can be isolated quickly? It doesn't seem likely that these machines will have capacity to check all arrivals by air and sea - and even if they could, there's still that problem of a negative result even after exposure to the virus.In my opinion, maintaining social distancing and quickly isolating outbreaks will be the only practical way forward.Much though I would love to go to Greece this year - and I still have reservations for September - I'm trying to balance that wish with the conflicting needs of the Greek tourist economy and the health of its people."
".>>Better yet before anyone is flying into Greece they should be tested before the flight that will save everyone a lot of misery, especially if you get tested in Greece and found to have the infection and end up quarantined for better part of your trip.<<Not sure you can win on this one. I agree it would be better as it would stop infected people spreading it on the plane, but it will still mean having to tell people they can't go on the holiday they've paid for because they've tested positive at home."
"#596. Oh my goodness, that has got to be the biggest abuse of trust I have read so far. The family should be ashamed of themselves. A bit like the six local police officers here who attended an ‘illegal’ bbq mid May, whilst still enforcing the lockdown laws in the community, and who have since all proved positive for Covid-19. Beggars belief."
>>I agree it would be better as it would stop infected people spreading it on the plane<<There is much more chance an infected person spreads it somewhere else than he will spread it in the plane. The airquality in a plane is the same or even better than it is in (for example) a classroom or a theater.
"Yes, the air quality on planes may be better, but people are squeezed closer together than in classrooms or theatres. Four hours sitting next to an infected person, even if wearing a mask, would surely be a risk. People sitting in aisle seats would be exposed to everyone walking past."
"Would love to have enjoyed my booked holiday to Crete this year in July/August, but with current testing and risk of quarantine in place I will not be going. As a regular traveller to Greece, this has put doubts into a lot of foreign holidays in the future. Now hoping that if the current restrictions are in place when I am due to travel, the airline cancels."
"I'd be flying for a lot longer than 4 hours from the US even with a lay over in Europe. I can't see myself wearing a mask for that length of time or sitting close to a fellow passenger for an extended period of time.For those who fly we know how crammed the flights are and even with ""spacing"" it's tight quarters.I'm not getting a good vibe about my upcoming trip starting on arrival in Athens on Oct. 1.Still, I'm holding out before I make a decision on cancelling in case by some miracle (figure of speech) everything gets better so we can all travel safely and arrive in Greece without the virus.Wishful thinking but I'm not ready to throw in the towel . . . yet!Edited: 4:15 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"This is what it's like at Athens airport: https://www.efsyn.gr/ellada/koinonia/246745_…{copied from Google translation}""In the context of the Greek government's epidemiological policy for testing and quarantine visitors from countries and airports other than the approved list, in order to avoid any infection with the virus, passengers from Paris landed in Athens at 6.50 p.m. and we were stacked in a waiting room without adequate ventilation, where it was impossible to keep up with the social distance, and we waited until we were given a pharyngeal smear in other specially designed areas.Then they brought other passengers from another flight. As a result, hundreds of people waited for more than two hours in the confined space, many standing, as seen in the photos, or walking up and down due to lack of space and seats.All passengers were not given any information or professional instructions, and the management was assigned to the employees of the private subcontracting company GOLDAIR HANDLING, who were also at risk.Meanwhile, a large video screen was constantly showing the message ""Your health is our priority"" and giving advice on strict social distance (at least 1.5 meters) which was impossible to observe.At one point, people were finally taken to intensive care units at the medical station where the tests were performed and statistics were collected by civil protection personnel. The passengers then headed to the baggage claim area and hurriedly boarded buses which took them to specific hotels in Athens where, in our case, there was not the slightest social distance to the reception area as everyone arrived in groups.During this whole process, the authorities did not impose the appropriate security measures for a single moment.In short, travelers arriving in Greece are quarantined in the name of public health under conditions that potentially undermine it. It would not surprise me if I learned that new cases arose as a result of this problematic process."""
"This was similar to landing in Thessaloniki in March. There was no social distancing just the usual queue at check in, bag drop, boarding gate and then herded on the bus to take us to the plane. The flight was full so again, no distancing.How are parents with 3/4 or even more it seems these days, children going to implement wearing of masks for over 7 hours? I wear mine for 10 mins in the supermarket and it’s hot and itchy.I haven’t even ventured to the hair dressers yet!!! 4 hours in a mask, no thanks!!"
"If this kind of chaos prevails when random testing starts, I can't see how anyone would want to go to Greece.Until reading this, I had thought there was a 25% probability of being able to travel to Greece (from the UK) in September, but my wish not to get caught-up in situations where social distancing isn't possible would reduce the chances sharply (to, perhaps, 5%)."
"#606 I entirely agree, it would be the most stressful start to the holiday. Add to this the report that UK quarantine involves nothing more than completing a form by the passenger.No follow up has been budgeted for, no testing on return... The probability of catching the virus in transit are quite high. The UK travel industry has the worst of all worlds - the fact is that until our infection rates reduce, its harder to attract people to holiday here. And with the apparently unpoliced quarantine, this gives the UK no protection and makes it unlikely we will travel abroad."
"Yes, transit is likely to be the pinch point with highest risk.Of course, we have to be allowed to travel first and I'm sure that other countries will think twice about having us.From a selfish perspective I wasn't so worried about the prospect of quarantine on return home as I wouldn't be doing anything much different to now (apart from not going out for exercise and eating from the freezer instead of doing food shopping); so I had hopes that it might reduce crowding on any flights that are available.However, since our government seems to be managing things with its customary panache for clear messaging and organisation, it seems unlikely that anyone in their right mind would come here voluntarily."

"I was wondering, being from the United States, if even we could come to Greece in Sept with no restrictions how will the Greeks treat us. Will they welcome us with open arms or will they stay clear away. Even though I am half Greek and I look very Mediterranean."
"#610 Yes I agree. Thats my only reservation too. We're due to go in September as well and I'm hoping for a drastic improvement in our situation in the UK, so that we will not be seen as a threat to our hostsMaggie"
Yiassas. Yes thats very true. At least waiting until September gives us all a chance to see how things pan out. But we all have to put our toe in the water at some point to see what happens. We may never find a vaccine and we may have to learn to live with the virus. Its all a great big unknown. Maggie
"Those of us from the US with plans to travel in the Fall (Sept./Oct) are in a holding pattern.The final say will be Greece's and whether they will allow Americans into the country.As a frequent traveler to Greece I have always been welcomed, treated with courtesy, have always been helped when lost or given advice on where to eat, things to see and lots of other helpful information.I doubt they will shun us. If you have Greek ancestry that will help but if you don't learn a few words and phrases in Greek and you'll be well received.The virus has caused many unknowns but the biggest one for Americans is whether Greece will let us into the country.As of now the US's rate of infections and deaths continue to increase in parts of the country while other parts are leveling off.Hard to say what will happen but I'm still hopeful I can make it to Greece in early October.Edited: 3:56 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"We have our first trip to Athens in October as well crazyh, postponed from March and hope it will happen this time, fingers crossed.I do hope we can both make it."
"@crazyh, yes, I know lots of words and phrases in Greek. Been studying Greek for a few months now. @twinkletoes, I'm sorry to hear that the child got the covid. At least kids don't get it so bad and bounce back quickly. I'm surprised your schools are still in sesstion. Our schools quit classrooms and went online only back in March. They are all out for the summer now."
"Even if I postpone my trip to May, how do we know this Covid thing will be any better by then. Maybe it will be worse. Maybe it will be better. Maybe there will be a vaccine. Maybe there will never be a vaccine. No one knows anything. Geez, why did that guy have to eat that bat anyway. Just one action brings all of this reaction. Crazy."
#617. The youngest children (reception) have just gone back to school (specially adapted classrooms) but many parents have kept their children off. There has been a lot of controversy about the issue as the aim was to get all primary kids back to school soon but that idea has been abandoned now. It’s the great unknown hereon in. The current scenario world-wide is new to us all. We can only hope and pray for better times ahead. Stay safe.
"We don't know if things will get any better. As I've stated the only guarantee is a vaccine which is still many months away if not longer.I don't know what's going on in other countries but in the US many states are opening up their businesses, parks, beaches, etc. while the virus is still active and infections are rising in a number of those states.More disturbing is the amount of people still not wearing face masks and social distancing.With that type of attitude the virus will continue to spread and who knows what the future holds but I don't believe it will be good."
"We’re experiencing irresponsible behaviour too here in the UK from some people, whilst others are following the government’s advice to the letter. It is indeed upsetting to see packed beaches, crowds of people gathering etc, which certainly won’t help keep the infection rate down.Our non-essential shops are re-opening on Monday, with limited numbers allowed to enter, social distancing and other special measures in place. Hairdressers and the like are set to re-open early July. Also wearing of face masks on public transport will become mandatory shortly. Let’s hope these measures work. Our progress in tackling the virus is not as fast as we would like but at least we are moving in the right direction. I do hope the new found freedom in the US does not cause a second spike."

Thanks for posting Nicksy.
"Nicksy, so I'm a bit confused. Does this mean they are going to no longer di the 7 day quarantine if negative. This just keeps changing every week"
"blackpupchucky, it has never been said that there would be a 7 day quarantine after a negative test. So far with a negative test, one still had to go 7 day in self isolation which is not the same as the quarantine with a positive test. I may have missed it but as far as I know today nothing has been said about self isolation with a negative test anymore.>>This just keeps changing every week<<As it does in many countries as all rules/regulations are regularly adjusted according to the change of the epidemical data.Edited: 3:11 pm, June 12, 2020 "
Since some of us won't be planning our trip till Sept./Oct. I guess there's no point in worry about what's happening now or the next month or so.As stated the situation is fluid and can change depending on the virus in the country you are traveling from and what the virus is doing in Greece after allowing tourists in from various countries..Still see the US not allowed into Greece until at least July 1 so will have to keep watching the forum and Greek websites for further info after July 1.
In terms of travel I have already drawn a line through 2020 however...Until the infection rate and sadly deaths in the UK drop I don’t see how travel restrictions to Europe can be improved for British tourists?
"#628: I feel the same about America. Many states are opening up and we are now seeing an increase in infections in a number of those states. A number of other states that had high infection rates but took the proper precautions are now seeing a drastic drop in cases.Hard to say what the infections/deaths will be as America opens up but I think they are putting people's well being and lives at stake for the sake of the economy.It may cause Greece to continue to ban Americans into their country for quite a while and I will be greatly disappointed by the lack of leadership in America resulting in my trip being canceled.I'm still hoping but every day the hope lessens.Edited: 4:04 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"Still hoping for a July holiday to Crete. Here in Wales infection rates are now low, but we are still under strict lockdown only allowed 5 miles from our home. Cannot travel 20 miles to England, let alone Greece at the moment."
"Greece’s plan to secure the islands stay Coronavirus-free in summer 2020. Therefore the Greek Health Minister presented a detailed action plan. The main points of this plan are:-All of the country’s islands now have access to medical services either on location or via transport to the nearest facility.-All hospitals, healthcare units or centers on the islands will be operating on a 24-hour basis.-The number of medical and health care staff stationed on the islands has been increased.-446 beds and 19 Intensive Care Units (ICU) for Covid-19 cases have been secured for the islands with the capacity to increase to 674 and 79, respectively should the need arise.-Health centers as well as floating medical units are working together with NGOs to carry out extensive sample testing while mobile health facilities will be conducting tests, collecting data for epidemiological research and tracking information.-Syros and Rhodes will be equipped with PCR testing units with smaller units on smaller islands.-The National Center for Emergency Assistance (EKAB) has been equipped with isolation capsules for the safe transport by air ensuring a sanitary care environment for highly contagious patients.-Medical air transportation services will be carried out by helicopters and planes of the Greek Air Force and the Civil Protection secretariat, marine means of the port authorities, and via private means.- There will be hospitals with Covid-19 ICU on these islands:Mytilini, Rhodes, Samos, Syros, Chios, Zakynthos, Corfu, Agios Nikolaos, Heraklion, Chania- Hospitals in Santorini, Mytilini, Rhodes, Samos, Syros, Chios, Ikaria, Kalymnos, Kythira, Kos, Limnos, Naxos, Leros, Halkida, Karystos, Kymi, Zakynthos, Corfu, Kefalonia, Lefkada, Lixouri, Agios Nikolaos, Heraklion, Rethymno, Chania, Ierapetra, Neapoli, Sitia will be open 24/7- There are Health centers in Aegina, Andros, Ios, Karpathos, Milos, Mykonos, Paros, Patmos, Milos, Amorgos, Samothrace, Thassos, Skiathos, Skopelos, Ithaki, Paxi, Tinos, Salamina"

"Again, thanks for posting Nicksy. You’re doing a great job of keeping this thread uptodate. Am impressed with the planning that’s in hand, let’s hope the services put in place are not greatly needed. Anyone travelling to the less well equipped islands at least knows this in advance and can make their choices accordingly."
Yes twinkletoes. They surely can
"Wow, thank you for the update, Nicksy. Wondering what people's experience is at the airport these days? You hear that people are being taken to a hotel where they spend the night and are tested, but is this true of everyone who comes from the ""at risk"" airports is it random -- and then you hear that people are being tested at the airport. I imagine that it is a work in progress and will probably change as we move through the summer, but if anyone actually flowin in to Greece the last few days, it would be great to hear from them."
See post #604
"So as I understand, we can travel from EU to Greece from 1st july with Just random test, even blacklisted airports.."
"Dr. Fauci, the US government's expert on infectious disease stated that travelers from the UK will likely be banned for many months from entering the US due to the virus.I wonder if Greece heard that and if it will affect Greece's decision about allow Brits entering their country.I also wonder if Greece is keen on allowing US citizens to enter their country when America's record on the virus is probably worse than the UK's!"
"Holiday booked last year and due to fly out on 19th July. Going to give it another week or so and if no information I think we will sadly be rescheduling till next year. Will see what the next week brings but as a family we were looking forward to 2 weeks in Zante, will depend in risks and measures in place whether we get there. Stay safe!"
"Considering Greece is allowing China and Italy in I think they are being very pragmatic and figuring that the kind of people that would come from these countries would in all likelihood after all these months of living with this virus be cognizant enough about where they've been and what they're getting in to. Even though the U.S. may not want tourists from Europe, Greece certainly wants them... and understandably so. It's going to be a long and interesting summer:)"
"For those who do not get emails from Aegean Airlines, this is the process to be followed from today till 30 June.""To help you plan your next travel, here are some key points of the flight restrictions currently imposed by the Greek Government for arrivals to Greece effective June 15th and until June 30th 2020.Arriving passengers are categorized in accordance with their origin in three distinct groups as follows:GROUP A: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland.GROUP B: Albania, Belgium, France, Italy, North Macedonia, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, other non-EU countries.- Passengers arriving at Athens International Airport originating from GROUP A will be subject to random Covid-19 testing upon their arrival.- Passengers arriving at Athens International Airport originating from GROUP B, either with a direct flight or through a country included in Group A, will be subject to 100% Covid-19 testing upon their arrival.- Passengers arriving at Thessaloniki Airport, will be subject to 100% Covid-19 testing upon their arrival.All international passengers will be provided during check in or on board, with a Passenger Location Form, to be filled and provided to the authorities upon arrival.Tested passengers have to compulsory self-isolate in the address they will declare for 24 hours, until the testing outcome is available.Connecting Passengers are subject to COVID-19 testing upon their arrival in Athens or Thessaloniki and will be able to continue their trip to their final destination, where they will self-isolate until the testing outcome is available.Furthermore, the Greek Goverment has extended flight restrictions from/to UK and Turkey until June 29th, 2020.""Edited: 1:39 am, June 15, 2020 "
Which means you don't have to stay anymore in a hotel designated by the government to wait for the result of the test.
"Yes, that part is interesting. At first I thought Aegean may have got it wrong but since connecting passengers are tested at ATH and SKG and then allowed to continue their journey to their final destination, it seems it has indeed changed and now everybody is allowed to go their final destination and wait for the test results there. Still no clarity for those who plan to go to Piraeus and take a ferry. When the 24h start and how are they supposed to self-isolate on a ferry?"

I’m curious from any who are flying from the USA to Greece how you got there and what your experience was like. What countries did you transfer through? From my understanding it seems that Paris does not allow transfers unless you’re returning to your country of origin but Amsterdam may?
Flights from the US into any airport within the EU are banned for the moment. At least till the end of June.
"From today more restrictions have been lifted. These businesses are allowed to operate again from today: seasonal hotels and rooms to let museums gyms amusement parks brothels physical wellness services baths, thermal springs and saunasMeanwhile there was a 20KM queue at the Promachonas border post between Bulgaria and Greece. Allthough the official announcement that the border would be opened for tourists at “12 o’ clock noon"", many thought it would open at midnight Sunday night. Finally the border was opened at 11 o'clock.https://youtu.be/GVIulJHJTZk"
Are you sure there are no current flights between the US and Europe?Flightview lists daily departures from Boston to London Heathrow. There are also daily departures from JFK to and from multiple European capitals with actual takeoff and landing times.
If you do a Google search for flights from the US for current flights you'll see there are some flights available from Boston.However Greece is not allowing anyone from the US to arrive so not sure if those flights are the real deal.Greece will announce on July 1 if they will allow anyone from the US or other countries that have high rates of the virus.I'm booked with Swiss Airlines for a Sept. 30 flight from Boston to Zurich to Athens.It's still on schedule.
This changes so much. I thought the US was allowed to enter Greece starting June 15th and the states on the naughty list have to have a mandatory covid test and the states not on the naughty list were only randomly tested.
"Indeed you can’t fly to Greece from the US as of now. However my message was in response to a statement that all flights from the US to Europe are banned, which is incorrect.Greece stated that they will allow all passengers from all countries starting in July 1st (with some random screening). I hope this will hold.The number of new cases in Massachusetts continues to drop. We are at 87 new cases today. I am hopeful that number will be zero by the end of the month. Lumping all states in the US together doesn’t make sense given the size and spread of the country. I remain hopeful there will still be an August vacation in Greece."
"FYI.Emirates to Newark flight from july 1-14 were cancelled earlier today . Acc to rep, due to covid situation. July 15 first available outbound. This sucks"
"There have been a few flights from the US to the UK for repatriation, etc, but at the moment anyone entering the country must undergo a 14 day quarantine. The UK isn’t a Schengen country, and so far isn’t on the list of countries from which one can fly to Greece. Anyone thinking they can somehow get to Greece via a third country should realise it is where your trip originates, not where your connecting flight is from. If your trip originates in the US, restrictions for that country will apply.Edited: 2:32 am, June 16, 2020 "
This states that there are no direct flights between the US and Greece until 1 July at the earliest - however currently indirect flights are possible - I'm not sure how this affects self-isolation and/or quarantinehttps:/…
"There is still a restriction on non-essential travel into the EU till 30 June. And yes there are some flights to allow travel for people belonging to the categories that are excempted from that regulation: - all EU citizens and citizens of the Schengen Associated States, and their family members for the purposes of returning home - non-EU citizens who are long-term residents in the EUThe temporary travel restrictions should also not apply to people with an essential function or need, including - healthcare professionals, health researchers, and elderly care professionals- frontier workers- seasonal workers in agriculture- transport personnel engaged in haulage of goods and other transport staff to the extent necessary- diplomats, staff of international organisations, military personnel and humanitarian aid workers in the exercise of their functions- passengers in transit- passengers travelling for imperative family reasons- persons in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons respecting the principle of ‘non-refoulement’.See https:/…travel-and-eu-during-pandemic_enEdited: 4:10 am, June 16, 2020 "
It’s the origin of the passenger that counts - where their journey started - not where they boarded the flight into Greece; indirect or direct makes no difference.
"Elsewhere on the US embassy website: https:/…""Ban on Entry of non-EU Citizens Extended to July 1: Greece, along with other EU member states, is limiting entry to EU citizens and residents until July 1. Non-EU citizens may not enter Greece for non-essential travel, which includes tourism. Exceptions include spouses or minor children of EU/Schengen nationals, long-term residents, members of government delegations and passengers in transit.Travel on and after July 1: In the coming weeks, the Greek government is expected to announce restrictions regarding certain countries effective July 1. We will update this page when the information is available. Flights: For those who qualify to travel between now and June 30, you may be subject to mandatory or random COVID-19 testing and quarantine depending on your travel itinerary. Please see the details on our COVID-19 page."" I would be very careful as I have already read about US citizens being turned back after arriving in the Schengen zone (for example one US passenger who arrived in Iceland on a Wizzair flight from the UK)"
On Monday there were 13 new cases of persons infected with the corona virus. 1 of them was a passenger arriving by plane on an international flight. 30 international flights arrived in Athens and Thessaloniki on Monday.
As I understood of all information I found. It's orgin of the flight starts. Not nationallity of a person. Exp. Like lot of Dutch person will take a flight starting from Germany and will be no problem to enter Greece.
"Late yesterday evening the Greek Civil Aviation Authority issued a statement confirming and repeating some regulations. The CAA air instructions refer to the period June 15-30.The flight ban from/to Turkey and UK as well as the temporary ban on non-Europeans entering the country remains till 30 June - 23.59.Arrivals at Athens Airport: All passengers from Albania, Belgium, France, Italy, Northern Macedonia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden will be tested.Thessaloniki Airport maintains temporary suspension of flights from nine (9) countries (Albania, Belgium, France, Italy, Northern Macedonia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden), until Tuesday, June 30 - 23:59.For the rest of the country’s regional airports, the ban on foreign flights until the end of June applies.Passengers from other European destinations will be randomly assigned for testing.Source (in Greek): ypa.gr/news/aeroporikes-odhgies-notams-gia-t…"
It's Chinese Water Torture waiting for July 1 to see if Greece will allow US citizens into their country.They could say not at this time but make another announcement in a few weeks regarding who can come into their country.The longer the wait the more likely I may have to rebook. I can't get a refund unless my airlines cancels the flight and who knows when or if that may happen or at the last moment making it even more nerve whacking!I'm still keeping my fingers crossed!
Is it possible to enter Greece if travelling from the US with either a UK or Mexican Passport?If so is it possible with no Quarantine?It is unclear if I will be admitted into Greece if I am entering with a UK passport.If I had a Greek passport yes no problem.
is there nobody ( TripAdvisor user ) that had travel recently to Greece..To tell us how exactly it is at the airport. I have tickets from Czechia on 7 July for Zakynthos (direct flight). The company (Czech airlines) said that their flights are on schedule for July) and the hotel .. can provide us a voucher to use it until 2021... But ofc I want to go in this vacation so badly

"#s 663 & 664,It’s the country where your trip originates that counts, not your citizenship or passport. If you lived in a country from which travel to Greece Is currently allowed the Covid rules for that country would apply."
you guys don't know my wife....i was forced to
When do we hear about the UK being allowed entry please and what tests will we have to have?
"I am still looking forward to come Santorini in mid of September for my wedding....Hope everything will be fine, fine, fine"
"@673, read post 662."
"#675 - #662 doesn't answer the question raised in #673!The question is: when will the Greek government announce what will be the case for the UK for 1 July onwards (i.e will the current rules continue or change)? The 1 July is less than 2 weeks away so I'd imagine it will be next week, but this is just my opinion. Or are you saying that they'll announce it at 23:59 on 30 June?!"
"Oh, I see.Here it comes next week!"
Exactly then we all hop on the plane 2 minutes later!
Apart from special assistance flyers of course!
"I believe all tourists will be at risk from random tests on arrival even after July 1st. It seems you are less likely to be tested if you are flying from a smaller regional UK airport than Gatwick, Heatnrow, Manchester. If you are subject to a random test I understand you have to provide contact details and maybe stay isolated until results are know. (within 24hrs)."
If you're self catering you will have to go shopping on arrival so presumably that is allowed?
"The Greek Coast Guard will launch a program of extensive systematic checks on ferries regarding the imposed health protocols and the restrictions measures against the coronavirus. The program will be launched as of Friday, June 19, 2020.The checks will be held throughout the trip by Coast Guard teams that will be on board the ferries.The aim of he checks is the full implementation of the restriction measures by the crew and the passengers in a period that the passengers traffic is increasing and it expected to increase further with the gradual arrival of tourists to Greece.--------------------------------------Coronavirus infections recorded a sharp increase, with Greece’s health authorities to announce 55 new confirmed cases yesterday evening.The overwhelming majority of the new cases have been reportedly recorded in the Prefectures of Xanthi and Rodopi in north-eastern Greece. Only 1 new confirmed case was reported to be somebody arriving in a flight from abroad.https:/…"
only the people tested would need to self isolate so hopefully not everyone in your party would be grounded.Most resorts are well set for deliveries should you have a problem. Your biggest challenge would be a positive result :(
"News for UK travellers.It's being leaked by UK Government sources this morning.It's being leaked this morning that "" British holidaymakers could enjoy overseas breaks from July 4 under plans being drawn up by the government.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce on June 29 that agreements have been made for so-called air bridges with a “small number” of countries with low levels of coronavirus.This would allow families to take foreign holidays without having to self-isolate on their return to the UK.Ministers want to set up air bridges to countries that are “most advantageous” to the UK economy, which are likely to include popular destinations such as France, Spain, Greece and Portugal, according to Government sources.One source told the Telegraph: “The plan is to announce a small number of air bridges on June 29th, though it won’t come into force until July 4. Obviously it will depend on factors such as the scientific advice and the level of coronavirus infections at the time.“The Foreign Office will also have to change its travel advice before then because that remains a block on people going abroad for holidays.”Edited: 7:13 am, June 19, 2020 "
"The BBC website says ""A travel corridor would mean that two people travelling in both directions between two countries would not have to self-isolate after they travel."" so potentially no good for a family/group of people. It might not be true or maybe it's just a poor example.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53104733Edited: 10:31 am, June 19, 2020 "
"The UK Government might want to create an ^air bridge^ with Greece which is fine in theory, but in practise, it doesn't mean that UK citizens will be allowed into Greece by the Greek Government. It seems a rather one sided outlook on things to me, when Greece has one off the lowest virus rates and the UK has the highest , then what does Greece gain from that arrangement ?"
#687 - lots of Euros from tourism. And Greeks could travel to the UK if they wanted to on the same terms. It goes without saying that it would have to be a mutual agreement.
""" Government sources "" say people could only travel with members of their household or ‘support bubble’, however, unless rules on social distancing are eased before July. Sounds like it's okay for a fmaily gathering.And, of course, it would be by agreement with the Greek government who I would imagine are desperate for UK visitors."
Please can you advise where else in addition to the plane where face masks have to be worn? If so for shops will it still be in place by mid July? Thanks
Are people (locals/tourists) keeping their distance from each other? I know how crowded Athens can be and it's almost impossible to keep the recommended distance from another person.Are tavernas following guidelines about how close tables can be and how many people at a table?Here in the US guidelines are being relaxed and/or ignored in many parts of the country even though the government is still saying to wear face masks and keep one's distance (unless of course you are the President!)
"Thanks Yiassis, yes I knew about the airport, we will be hiring a car so no issues there, so maybe just shops if others are, maybe less so by mid July too."
Jet2 have cancelled all holidays until 15th July.
"Yiassis, do you know, do they sell medical face masks in the pharmacies in Athens? And is it mandatory to wear masks inside the shops?"
I understand that current rules for rental cars state that maximum persons are driver and one passenger. As we are two couples travelling together our agent has arranged only one and did not seem to know about this restriction. We do not travel to Preveza until 30th August. Does anyone have any information on this or an indication that it might be relaxed at some point? Also that face masks must be worn inside the vehicle which seems appropriate for a taxi but somewhat strange in a private car.
"That seems ridiculous wearing masks in your own car with people from your own household, can anyone confirm if people are doing that?"
"Paulaf, my understanding is that masks are only a requirement for cars 'with a driver', ie Taxis. Not necessary for rental cars.Keith, the advice given here (22nd May) would seem to indicate that two couple travelling together would need two cars. It may have changed since then though.https:/…"
"UK government sources indicating that it could be as early as tomorrow that Greece is among a handful of countries including Portugal, Spain, Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Canary Islands where bilateral travel agreements have been reached to provide so-called air bridges that circumvent quarantine.As it stands, the Foreign Office (FCO) advises against all but essential travel, so travelling abroad would invalidate travel insurance, but this advice is also expected to change in the next day or two."

Where did May come from ?August !!!
Hello! I planned to travel in Greece and my flight is supposed to arrive around 2 am in the morning. I wanted to book a morning flight on the same day in order to visit an island island. I'm traveling with 2 friends. What happens if one of us has to do the Random test to detect the Covid-19? I guess that we will be requested to wait at the airport for the results no? Which means that we would miss our morning flight to our final destination?Do you know more about the procedure? How long does it take if you are selected to do the test? Are they doing them in the evening as well? Thanks in advance
"#707 I am pretty sure I read that those selected for random testing are not held at Athens airport, but are able to travel on to their destination.I have no idea how long the test takes (it's only a few minutes to administer, but I suppose it depends on the number being done), but I would expect that they would be taken across all times of the day."
"Just read a news article that UK will be among the banned countries in the next phase allowed into Greece. Disappointed that we will not be coming to Greece this year, but at least we can now start cancelling our travel arrangements."

Thanks Donny!
and no Brazil? I thought the EU had yet to make a statement. Is Greece just doing their own thing on this? Seems a very bold move. On the other hand UK visitors could really present Greece with some potential risk given their situation. Will watch for more info here. Thanks.
Yes but this the July 1st tranche. UK are ( hopefully) in the July 15th tranche. Don't panic yet!!
"It's not looking good for America either. I am scheduled for a Sept. 30 flight but it appears that may not happen unless America takes drastic action to slow down the virus.Instead of things getting better in the US they are getting worse. I can't really blame Greece and the EU for not allowing Americans into the county.July 1 will be the official date for an announcement so maybe there's a chance but I'm not expecting good news for Americans and other countries with still high rates of infections.One ironic thing: I'd be safer in Greece than in my state for getting the virus and my state is one of the better ones for handling the virus!Edited: 9:18 am, June 26, 2020 "

Me again. Cant do links but read Keep Talking Greece. Same item but stating its not confirmed.
Agreed but the link is slightly different as its from a different paper and gives more detail of the UK's position regarding bilateral agreements
Thank you Yiassas. Thats the one
Looks like Aegean have cancelled the LHR to ATH flights on 1st and 2nd so there might be something in the press stories?
Thoughts on Canada being let in on July 1st? I saw an article that Canada will be on the okay list. Thinking of booking for July 11th.

"So far these are all SPECULATIONS!!! As long as the Greek government has not communicated officially about what's going to happen from 1 July it's not official. So, ASAP as the Greek government communicates their decisions these will be posted in this thread."
How often do the Greek government review travel arrangements?
BA still have many flights scheduled for early July.
"I know everyone who wants to travel to Greece from countries that have not been allowed to do so are getting anxious and are speculating on what Greece will do.We just have a few more days to go.

"It seems odd that with air bridges about to be announced between UK and some countries, it could still be possible to travel to Greece via another country with a short stopover. Eg UK to Greece via France."
The only way for the UK to enter Greece is IF we have a bilateral agreement. Entering via another country would not be possible because its the country of origin that matters. Thats my understanding anyway :-)
"There is nothing to stop you coming indirectly from the UK to Athens. There are people here now who have flown to Germany and then Athens. There are loads of Germans, Bulgarians, Romanians who have all entered overland. Unfortunately they don’t spend money in the tavernas as the Balkans bring it all with them. However, because of the influx of Germans from highly infected regions the locals and ex pats are all staying home and not spending money locally. Certainly where we live it’s like Lockdown all over again!!!"

"Once you’ve completed the first one, you’re then given the opportunity to add another - and, I presume, more if necessary.This might be premature, but I completed the form and got this charming response, that reeks of a country the has its act together:-“Dear Mr. Bernard H*********,Thank you for completing the Passenger Locator Form before your trip to Greece. We appreciate your cooperation in this extraordinary circumstance. We are doing everything we can to accommodate your stay in Greece and keep you safe.Beginning July 1, 2020, the Greek government has determined how the country will welcome travellers, carry out the necessary diagnostic screening, and keep everyone safe throughout the season.We will shortly be in touch again with more details with regards to your submitted PLF document.In the meantime, you can continue planning your trip to Greece and we are looking forward to welcome you here. The Greek summer is a state of mind.Stay safe, stay healthy, and enjoy Greece.”"
"That is such an impressive response Bernard, makes you feel individual and welcome, and the indication is that visitors from the UK will be allowed in for sure (i.e. “keep planning”). Please keep us posted!"
"Bernard H, that is a great response. What date are you due to fly to Greece? We have flights booked for the second half of July from UK, although not yet cancelled we were not hopeful about being allowed into Greece without quarantine. We will have until 8th July to cancel our hotels and other arrangements without losing more than deposits, so hopefully we will know either way by then. Fingers crossed for you as well."
#752If you are travelling to more than one destination you are required to declare your initial destination on the form plus your itinerary for the first 7 days
"#755 I am not going until end of August, but I thought there was no harm in completing the details now as I wanted to see what the Greek government wanted to know.I hope you’ll be OK for your trip.

QUARANTINE OR NOT?Even though there are not many people arriving in Greece right now there are people testing positive on arrival. What is the situation for passengers if just one person on their flight tests positive? Will all the passengers be quarantined?
Way to go Bronia and have a great time when you travel :-)

Excellent Nicksy thank you.
I read that you need to put the addresses of the accommodation for the first seven days.

Fiscardofan - I've just looked back through the thread. Check #753 onwards especially Bernard H - good info.(Hope I've got the right poster there)!

It's very off putting as a potential tourist.
"All this discussion regarding countries being let only pertains to the AIRPORT they are flying in from, correct?I am a Canadian citizen going to the UK for a week and then planning to fly into Greece FROM London July 5th. None of this discussion regarding countries being let in concerns me if the UK forms an air bridge with Greece, right?"
">>It’s that or no tourism. Greece cannot let thousands of people in with no testing or measures in place for positive results, that would be off putting for residents!Then they should not lament that they have no income and post stories about children fainting of hunger because their parents are out of work. The virus in the population that want and can travel this year (young and relatively healthy) is up to 97% asymptomatic or with symptoms that normally would never make them go to a doctor. They are cancelling Greece solely because of this testing and quarantine thing. Would you want to sit in a hotel room for two weeks? Seriously?"
"Hi, I have a question that I can't seem to find the answer for anywhere.So, if you complete the passenger locator form, you will be tested based on your qr code score. Is there any way in which you can know if you will be actually tested? I mean, you get the score after you complete the form, why can't they tell you if you are tested or not? This way, if I am more likely to be tested, I will stay home and not lose one day on my holiday in self isolation."
Thank you for the information.
"Hi, I have a problem filling the PLF form. We are flying from Slovenia (with a stop in Serbia Belgrade airport) to Athens Int. Airport and then getting a ferry to Paros. In the PLF form there is a section Temporary Adress saying :Please enter the temporary address you will be residing for up to the next 14 days. If I select Greece there is no Paros nor South Aegean as a mandatory region, so I can't complete the PLF. The regions to choose from are: Anatoliki Makedonia kai Thraki, Attik, Dytiki Ellada, Dytiki Makedonia, Ionia Nisia, Kentriki Makedonia, Kriti, Notio Aigaio, Peloponnisos, Sterea Ellada, Thessali, Voreio Aigaio, Iperios, Agion Oros.Do you have any suggestion how to solve this? Are we supposed to fill the form online or can we do it at the Airport?Thank you!"
Use Notio Aigaio.
"Thank you Heimdall, it worked!"
"I have a question about self isolating. As I understand it, if someone in our airplane and in the same or next row tests positive, then me and my husband must self isolate for the seven days (indeed, if our tests are negative). Does it mean that we cannot leave our apartment for the week? Who will provide us with the food etc?"
"Phytochemical wrote: ""The virus in the population that want and can travel this year (young and relatively healthy) is up to 97% asymptomatic or with symptoms that normally would never make them go to a doctor. "" And that is exactly why this test & trace & contain policy is there! If there are many ""healthy"" asymptomatic carriers wandering around Greece, potentially transmitting the virus to others who may not be so lucky when they fall ill, you think that is acceptable? Would you want to lay unconscious in an ICU for two months? Seriously?"
If that's what Greek people want then that's their country and their choice. I cancelled my two trips to Greece this summer and know several people who have done exactly the same as soon as they heard about random testing and quarantine. I think that many people from the UK do not realize what quarantine in Greece involves and why it's not compatible with tourism.

Unless it's classed as essential travel you will be travelling against the advice of the Canadian government and you will need to self isolate for 14 days on arrival in the UK."
"Phytochemical - I would agree with you there! For me personally, I am fully aware that I might get tested on arrival at Athens when I arrive and, if found positive, I will then be quarantined in a hotel not of my choice for 2 weeks and then return home. My decision to travel is based on an understanding of the risk in doing so. A lot of British may take a view that it is not worth the risk and not go. Another group may not care and go anyway and them complain loudly about how their holiday was ruined and that they were not to blame when found to be positive. For me, the main thing is that the Greeks are doing their best to keep Greece safe whilst balancing the need to revive the economy."
"Jetnoise - There's really 3 groups of British people who may go to Greece.The first is the people who booked holidays to Greece for the second part of 2020 before it was known COVID-19 would affect European holidays, meaning unless they can't go e.g. due to the border being closed, they might lose some or all of the money they have paid if they choose to cancel. This is the group I fall in to.Another is people who intended to travel earlier in the year who have accepted travel vouchers from airlines/travel agents. They'll have to use those vouchers for another holiday, although they can choose exactly when. They might also be able to opt to go to an alternative country, depending who they booked with. That might mean someone who originally booked Greece might instead go to Spain but it might also mean someone who booked a country which is still off limits due to a high COVID-19 infection rate might choose Greece as a safer alternative.Another is people who haven't booked anything, who might decide to travel depending on what happens but then could also decide to stay at home."
"I asked already and didn't get a clear answer. If one person on a flight tests positive, will all passengers be quarantined?"
"@Lucy Lane: I hope this answers your question.From July 1st, targeted tests will be conducted to arriving tourists according to epidemiological criteria.Travelers will have to fill out a “Passenger Locator Form”, an algorithm will decide according to a barcode whether a specific person is at risk of being a potential coronavirus carrier.Tests results are expected in 24-32 hours. The tested person should reportedly be in self-isolation in the accommodation declared on the PLF until the test results are out. Those tested positive will be accommodated in “quarantine hotels” for at least 7 day.So, in brief? the answer to your question is NO."
"Family and close contacts of those testing positive will also be quarantined. Family is obvious but I couldn't find what ""close contact"" means according to the Greek authorities. Are they people who sit near the positive person on the plane? People on the same booking (ie partners or groups of friends)? Both?Edited: 8:29 am, June 29, 2020 "
"Thanks for all the info, if tested positive can we stay in our private villa instead with food delivered arranged? Save the cost to the government of the hotel and keep a room free, just an idea?"
#797. Nice idea but highly unlikely I would have thought.
Thanks for replies. Can't see all those tested self isolating for a few days while they wait for results.
Hi AllI am completing the PLF form for my visit to Sifnos in August. The form asks for State/Province. For my first night I am staying in Piraeus and put that down as Attik? thats how it appears on the form and I am assuming that is Attika.Any ideas what i use for the Sifnos ? I cannot see anything that looks like Cyclades or Aegean.
Bloomberg reporting that Greece won't allow flights from Sweden and UK until 15 July: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…Haven't seen this verified elsewhere and its not clear from the article what their source is. Thoughts?
"Exactly especially if self catering, the lure of a taverna will be too tempting too, my idea was just because we're trusted here to self isolate."
Think I’ll have to wait for the Greek announcement tomorrow- supposed to be flying to Crete in 11July from the UK and haven’t got a clue if I need to start packing! Hope we get a clear update so I know where I stand and I can rebook for next year. Will be so disappointed if we cannot fly as I booked in October!
Would it be possible to send me the PLF Form that I have to fill in please? I'm travelling on the 5th of July.
"The Greek government is extending a ban on direct flights arriving from Britain, pushing it back to July 15. Direct flights from Sweden have also been banned until this date.There were high hopes that summer holidays to Greece would be given the green light this week, as the Government prepares to announce a list of 'air bridge' countries in the coming days. Air bridges will effectively mean people can travel abroad again; quarantine will be lifted for anyone arriving back into the UK from air bridge destinations, and the FCO travel ban will change – it has advised against all but essential travel since March.The government is expected to introduce a traffic light system that will classify countries depending on the prevalence of coronavirus. ‘Green’ will mean they are safer than the UK, ‘amber’ meaning less safe, and ‘red’ will mean arrivals will still need to self isolate on return from that country.There has been much speculation as to which countries would appear on the list. The Telegraph was last week told Mediterranean destinations including France, Italy, Greece and Spain would feature on the list. Others, including Portugal and Sweden, could miss out due to their rising rates of infection.Keen British holidaymakers have been booking in their droves ahead of the Government's announcement, which was originally due today but could be pushed back as late as Wednesday. Tui said bookings were up 50 per cent week-on-week, while Hays Travel, which bought Thomas Cook after the operator collapsed last year, said the phones “had not stopped ringing”.However, Greece's extended ban on flights arriving from the UK will now cause disruption to thousands of British holidaymakers, meaning they may need to fly in via another country, rather than direct from the UK, if arriving before July 15."

On the website of the ministry of foreign affairs they say that you can get a hard copy of the PLF during the flight. Is this old information?QuoteVisitors should complete (ideally before travel) a Passenger Locator Factor form (PLF) with their contact details in Greece. This can also be found on the Visit Greece app in hard copy during the flight and at a designated web based form.UnquoteSource https://www.mfa.gr/en/current-affairs/statem…
Sure hope Greece has a sophisticated contact tracing system ready to go because they will need it to handle the influx. Air travel is very high risk for spread and asymptomatic people will be flying with Covid. Just a fact.
"Doesn't look good for Americans traveling to Greece or other EU countries when the July 1 announcement is made. However it is my understanding that each EU country could make a separate decision.However, with the virus continuing to spread and with higher infections I doubt the US will make the July 1 list.It is my understanding that the EU will make additional announcements every 2 weeks so there is some hope but unless the US sees a dramatic decrease in the number of infections it could be a big disappointment for many of us but not really a surprise."
"An official staement will be made later today or tomorrow, but according the state-run press agency AMNA it has been decided during a meeting at the PM's office that Greece will not allow direct flights from the UK and Sweden untill 15 July.Regarding flights from third countries, Greece reportedly intends to move on the basis of the list compiled by the European Union, a list expected to be officially released today or Tuesday.Epidemiological data and the progress of virus curve are top criteria when it comes to allow direct flights from departure countries or not.Edited: 10:58 am, June 29, 2020 "
Thanks for this - I'd read similar but wasn't sure if this means flights from UK will definitely resume after 15th July or if there will be another review at that point?
@812 while no one is in the head of the people deciding this I think it reasonable to assume they are going to take another look closer to July 15th. If my news sources are correct UK is just now opening up bars? That move is what has triggered some real issues in US as many are indoors and social distancing and drinking don't seem to go together. I guess if you get another bunch of flights cancelled from UK to Greece by the main holiday carriers that is a signal that things might not happen soon. Really a waiting game and summer is moving along quickly.
Thank you - that's what I would guess too. But confusingly the airline we booked with (long before I'd even heard of Covid 19!) emailed me today to say the plane would be of a different configuration to the one they planned to fly then???? Just waiting it out as we luckily never got around to booking accommodation anyway...
"#813: Yes some ""real issues"" about opening up to soon and many people ignoring the guidelines about wearing face masks and social distancing.Not trying to be to political but in the end it's up to all of us to do our civic duty by wearing a face mask so we can get through this ASAP.Until then I am not overly confident that people from the US will be allowed into many EU countries."
"Is the 15th July another review date or will we be definitely be allowed in then, impossible to plan anything?"
"#816. I can’t see Greece committing right now to a specific date for flights from the UK to start, so much can happen in the next two weeks. All they are giving really is a date to aim for (in my humble opinion), at which time their admissions policy could still change should the need arise."
"Is there anything stopping someone from flying indirectly to Greece via an ""approved"" EU country such as Italy, Poland, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Holland etc? As in, depart London to say Krakow, and getting a connecting flight to Athens?From how I read it, only direct flights from UK to Greece are banned. There is no ban on UK residents entering Greece. Or have I got it wrong?"
">>Is the 15th July another review date or will we be definitely be allowed in then, impossible to plan anything?<<As it says: ""Epidemiological data and the progress of virus curve are top criteria when it comes to allow direct flights from departure countries or not.""It means the situation is reviewed on a regular base.If you look at the data, the UK has over the last 5 days on average 14,5 new cases per mln inhabitants. Compare that to Italy with 3,3/mln & Germany 4,8/mln. That's a reason for a flight ban to be extended."
"821But it says only 7 seats cars.i.e, 5 seat cars ar not allowed more than 2...I think"
"With all the uncertainty, think I'm going to postpone my trip from Sept to May. Plus I'll have more time to save more money so I can buy more. Plus it would really suck to be tested positive and have to quarantine for 14 days. That would be my entire vacation. No thank youNot good for swimming in May, but a lot cooler for sightseeingEdited: 8:30 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"After the long Wisconsin winter, Greece in May will be all that more enjoyable."
Well I'm looking into connecting flights if they mess us all around again and decide on 14th July to extend it again!
"PaulaDon't you think that attempting to enter Greece by getting a connecting flight because direct flights aren't permitted, rather goes against the whole ethic of trying to prevent the virus from being spread !"
"Mingalabarchris, I have to say although I absolutely agree with your comment, in the last three hours of checking with friends who are due to go to Greek Islands and Looking at social Media, Paula seems to be one of many intending to do the same! It’s not that I agree but if there is a loop hole, people take it. Whose fault is that? EU needs to Tighten those things so it can’t happen, you can’t blame people, moral or not, it will happen if there is a way?"
"#829. If your friends’ and paulaf’s #826 attitudes are representative of the degree of personal responsibility in our country, then the Greeks would do well to keep us out.I would like to go on holiday, but I would expect to do so in a manner that’s safe for me and for the Greek population - not by exploiting a loophole..Edited: 6:15 pm, June 29, 2020 "
@831cattle
"Hi Bernard H,I totally agree with your comments. I have had three flights cancelled up to now, to go to Corfu this year. Hopefully, I will finally get there in mid September. If not, so be it. I would never put any of my Greek and Ex Patfriends in any danger JUST because I want a holiday .For me, there are too many areas within the UK where ""Personal Responsibility "" does not exist and that is why we have the problems we have.Anyway, take care"
"@Bernard H & AldeNow you speak my language. Bravo for the comments!I sincerely hope that the Greeks would be smart enough to impose draconian penalties and a six-month quarantine for such ""patients""."
Can't agree more. I also have plans to visit Greece but until the respective Greek and British Governments actually give the go ahead then I'm not getting my hopes up. It was never stated that we would get the go ahead at the beginning of July for the UK to have the airbridge yet lots of people felt that the green light had been lit.When and if we get the chance to go then I hope everything goes ok and this means that the tourists need to follow the rules and guidelines both in their home country and more especially in the country we all love - Greece.
"Someone who is Greek lives here suggested it to me, he flew in on 28th from Heathrow via Zurich to Athens, filled in the form to say yes was from the UK and wasn't even tested. So I will take the chance as its remote we will be positive, many business people will have to do this."
"My god, how selfish can people be not caring about maybe bringing the virus to Greece. The Greeks make a lot of rules to enter the country and a lot of selfish people are trying to work around them..."
"Passport, how do you calculate your chances of being positive as ""remote""?Edited: 4:36 am, June 30, 2020 "
"This appears to be the attitude of a lot of Brits, and we've seen a lot not giving any consideration to others. Look at the images of the beaches over the recent weekends, the BLM protests, VE Day celebrations. This attitude probably also has a contributing factor to our high infection rate and death rate. The selfish ""I am alright Jack"" attitude is not a thing to be proud of. The restrictions to entry are there for a reason not a game to find the best solution around it.I am really keen to get to Greece next month, but if the British Government, Greece and the EU say I can't then so be it. Its for a reason, abide by it and stop being morons."
"#836 It’s quite clear to me that someone who previously asked about staying in their ‘own private villa’ during quarantine is not planning a business trip to Greece,You deserve to be locked up here with that kind of attitude."
"Regarding connecting flights I think some people forget the situation is currently changing. If in the next few weeks the rate of infection decreases in the UK but increases in Germany, then having flights between the UK and Greece booked via Germany may not turn out to be a good idea. Also for UK passport holders it needs to be remembered that currently the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to Greece, so if you book indirect flights now and travel out for a holiday while that advisory is still in place it will invalidate your travel insurance.Edited: 5:34 am, June 30, 2020 "
"#836Apart from the irresponsible attitude do you realise that while the UK FCO advise against non essential travel then your travel insurance won't be valid & you'll struggle to get consular assistance should you need it. Your EHIC might be valid but it won't cover repatriating your body should things go wrong.Edited: 9:40 am, June 30, 2020 "
"From the US Embassy in Greece:*Update: As 2:30 p.m. in Greece, today, June 30, we have not received official confirmation of travel restrictions effective July 1.*So no news yet.Edited: 10:30 am, June 30, 2020 "
@844 guess they are the last to know....EU made the confirmation and unless Greece wants to break from it ...no US travelers until at LEAST July 15 and I expect that to be extended. Not sure what point you are making?
"I find the Greek decision on the UK a bit strange.They, after all , asked to be included in the UK's plans for air bridges and until a few days ago were making all sorts of welcoming noises.Covid-19 rates continue to fall and death rates from all causes across the country are back to or below normal rates.It's entirely their choice of course but continued prevarication could see them lose out on a valuable portion of their summer tourist season to Spain and other Med countries."
The Greek government and Haris Theoharis the Greek Tourism Minister were making welcoming noises. But if anyone actually listened to him he actually made some 'noises' that mentioned in a few weeks.Many people took that to mean mid July.Other people just looked at main headlines and decided it was all go and started to pack their cases!Whichever country you are from you just need to wait until the green light is actually lit!
Agreed.I always thought booking anything for early July was dubious as the situation is still fairly fluid but unless there's a massive uptick in UK cases it's hard to see Greece holding out beyond the middle of July.But I wouldn't put money on it now ...
">>Covid-19 rates continue to fall and death rates from all causes across the country are back to or below normal rates.<<If you look at the data, the UK has over the last 5 days on average 14,5 new cases per mln inhabitants.

"#840Couldn't agree more. They are probably the same people who blatantly go down the supermarket aisles the wrong way, who think it's ok to use seats on public transport that has been clearly marked do not use or don't step to one side when passing other people in the street. In short the great elite who don't think that politeness, guidelines or social distancing applies to them.Greece is best off without them.Edited: 12:23 pm, June 30, 2020 "

"@850, I work part time in retail, and people are going down the wrong way on the aisles all the time. The aisles are clearly marked. Then there are the ones that never wear face masks. I didn't mean to get off subject, but it's so true."
"846 Agreed how many people will now book Spain to be sure they can go, it was my close 2nd choice and can still easily swop to that if i have to if they don't open up after 15th."
I see many here that just want their holiday to go off on budget and on time and let the Greeks take the risks. I think they are really overselling how much the Greeks want their business and underselling the intelligence of the Greek decision makers. As always time will tell.
"https:/…The above is a statement from the Council of the European Union issued today.Edited: 1:22 pm, June 30, 2020 "
Doesn't help with the UK/Greece ban.
#854: +1
#856 but it's not all about the UK/Greece ban.There are other countries in the world and within Europe who also would like to be able to send/accept tourists in a safe and timely way. Countries that have responded to the situation in a way that makes this possible for them now.The other countries including the UK will just have to bide their time!
"I don't see the USA. Not a real surprise. The EU will update the list every 2 weeks.As a side note I just received a new schedule from Swiss Airlines regarding my flight to Greece on Sept. 30. It is not do-able for me especially a 16 hour layover in Zurich instead of 2 hours! Plus terrible departure/arrival times costing me a full day of enjoyment in Greece on arrival and departure.With the unworkable schedule, the EU banning the US and the virus in general I had to cancel. Swiss will give me a refund which is very good on their part.I'm disappointed but I was always a bit leery about travel this Fall. Even though I'm an optimistic person there were just too many ""what ifs"" to deal with.I'm already planning for 2021!Edited: 2:17 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"Sorry you had to cancel, crazyh .... I was certain things would work out so you could still make it to Greece in the fall. But that new flight schedule & layover certainly would have made for a grueling travel experience. Good to hear Swiss is giving you a refund. Our airline has steadfastly refused refunds for the flights it cancelled in May, so we are out of pocket a large sum of money and stuck with vouchers that are only valid for two years -- if the airline manages to stay in business that long."
"Hello,I'm French but I will be flying from Germany to Athens on the 5th of July and I'm supposed to have a connecting flight to Santorini Island on the 6th of July morning. I will spend 2 days and half there until the 8th of July and then I will reach my home near Korinthos.1) Which adress should I write on the PLF Form? My adress in Santorini even if I will stay there for a short time? Or my home in Greece where I will spend the rest of my holidays?2) I wanted to book an hotel in Santorini at the last moment, directly when I will be on the island in order to avoid the risks of loosing money in case my flight is cancelled and in case I have to stay on quarantine. Is it possible to proceed like that regarding the informations asked on the PLF Form?3) Could you tell me which part of Greece is Santorini and which part of Greece is Korinthos? I'm not sure about what to write there.Thanks in advance"
"I decided I'm postponing my trip from September to latter May/early June. There is to much uncertainty right now and I just don't think it's safe to fly overseas right now. Plus having to wear a mask all the time in the airport than a 12 hour plane ride. Hopefully the US can straighten this out by then. Also, hopefully there might be a vaccine by then . We are just going to take a trip closer to home. Wish me luck getting a voucher with my third party travel agent, I would hate to be out $1000. Stay safe everyone."
"I'm finding it incredibly disappointing that so many people are talking about ways of circumventing the current restrictions one way or another. The restrictions are in place for the best reason there is, peoples safety.We are booked for Thessaloniki on the 31st July and as far as I'm concerned the criteria to be considered for travelling are:1) Least important, our flight isn't cancelled.2) The UK FCO (and to a lesser extent the Government) deem it safe.3) The Greek Government think it is safe to be there.4) Finally and most importantly. Predicated and informed by the indicators of 1 to 3, me and my family consider it safe for us and the people of Greece we will encounter.It just seems like utter madness to try and get there at whatever cost."
Well said !!!
"Dedicated to “fence jumpers”:It will be enough for Greeks to come to the forums, to read the ""posts"" and see the rebellion and plans on how to ""bypass the system"".

"Donny B: The final straw for my decision was the rescheduling of my flight that was totally unworkable for me.The reason for the refund was due to Swiss cancelling the return flight and then offering me a flight that was unacceptable to me as far as departure/arrival and time and the killer 16 hour layover.I don't think they would have given me a refund if the flight hadn't been canceled on their end. They do have a re-booking and voucher policy but I decided on the refund until I know about next year.Still getting a refund means I'll have that money for a future trip (2021)In the end there were too many ""what if"" scenarios to worry about.Yes, it was very disappointing not to be going but I have all my photos, videos, souvenirs and great memories from past trips to keep me motivated for next year.At least I'll get to see the Fall foliage here in the northeast US which I normally miss when I travel in Oct. to Greece."
"Crazyh, that’s disappointing sorry to hear you had to cancel. I am still holding up for a trip starting mid August. I honestly don’t see it happening. At this rate it will take several months for the US infection rate to come down to the current rate in Europe. Glad you got your money back. I am dreading the call with BA to cancel."
"This article is interesting: ""Tested positive in Greece? Life in a quarantine hotel""https:/…Pay attention to this part:""According to a report by Mega TV on Tuesday, those tested positive will stay in the quarantine hotel for at least 14 days or even longer that is until a COVID-19 test is negative.""We have this problem with quarantines in Poland - to be released from quarantine two subsequent negative tests are required and many people test positive for much longer than 2 weeks. Some have to remain in quarantine even up to 6 weeks because the tests keep coming up positive."
"I'm really interested to ask travellers- even if/when Greece allow UK flights to resume will you really take the risk of being pulled over for a virus test at the airport, which could lead to you (and your whole family) spending at least 14 days in a 'quarantine hotel' if one of you tests +ve? This is enough to make me cancel our holiday. Am I making a rash decision?"
"There’s a lot of passive aggressive and holier than though posts on this thread.Personally, I’ve fully observed the directions of the UK government since this started and I didn’t selfishly hoard food like so many others did at the start. I just want a holiday. If allowed and Kefalonia will have me, then I’ll be going."
"#871 - Probably to your 1st question - even more than likely if my trip can't be cancelled with refunds (eg. if flights are running, hotels are open and FCO allow travel). I wouldn't 'jump any fences' to get to Greece. I don't have a whole family to think about. And no to your 2nd question, you need to do what is right for you. And others will do what they feel is right for them.Edited: 3:37 am, July 01, 2020 "
"Well said Roy.I agree, I am waiting for the green light from Greece to say we can go and I will be off to Corfu with lots of euros to spend. Definitely not intending to “jump the fence” but I’ve had a cancelled holiday and if I can get to Greece later I will be a very happy bunny and will do everything to conform to the rules, masks, gloves and a test at the airport. Lisa I agree with you, I worry that one of us could possibly test positive and we are all quarantined but you have to have some hope and try not to worry yourself silly."
"Hi guys,Does anyone know how Greece define self-isolation?I am trying to work out how the 24hr initial ""Quarantine"" works if you get selected to be tested when landing. I am staying at a hotel, so wondering whether this means I can't leave my hotel room? Or whether I can't leave the hotel address?Thanks"
"#875 Similar situation to myself (if we actually do travel). I land at Athens airport late in the evening, overnight stay in Piraeus then a 7:00am ferry to Sifnos.Will this mean I carry on my quarantine in Sifnos, the authorities know my location from my PLF form"
Dan I was just about to post the same thing.We are hopefully travelling to Crete in Mid August. Our stay is only for 7 days so I'm wondering whether losing a day it's worthwhile going. The other thing I'd like to know is do you get informed what the result is or assume after 24 hours it's negative if you are not notified.Thanks.
>>do you get informed what the result is or assume after 24 hours it's negative if you are not notified.<<The result of the test is known after 24-30 hours and you are only informed if positive.
"Yes Dan, you stay inside your accommodation (i.e. hotel room/apartment etc) until you get the 'all-clear', hopefully the next day. Andy, assuming your results are not complete before you leave Pireaus, then you will be called into the quarantine hotel in Sifnos, should your test be positive.It's not a risk-free scenario for other travellers, unfortunately, as everyone needs to get from the airport to their hotel & in your case, possibly a ferry journey too. Track & Trace will be carried out for all close contacts."
"Danny, also be aware that as your holiday is less then 14 days you would need to purchase a new flight home, but you can't book that until you have a negative test. i.e. the quarantine starts at 14 days & you may then leave only once tested negative.I don't whether airlines will alter flight dates to accommodate this."
"I also would like to know that.I arrive in the evening, and sleep in the port/athens and in the morning take the ferry to the island (Kythnos).Will I be alowed to quarentine in kythnos? Or do I have to do it in Lavrion/Athens?Does that mean that I have to change the number of nighs in the hotel in my overnight stay? i.e., by booking 2 nigths in my hotel in Lavrion/Athens and reducing one night in my hotel in Kythnos?I have booked months ago the hotel in the island, but I have not booked my hotel for the first night and I'm unsure wether to book it in central athens our in Lavrion port, close to the ferry."
"Thanks for letting me know re. quarantine in your room.Its a bit strange that they would only contact you if it was positive. Essentially, what you're saying is that you can leave your hotel room 24 hours after your flight has landed. I.e. 11am flight lands, 11am next day you can leave your room - unless you hear otherwise?That definitely puts me off.Thanks!"
Thanks also.I only booked the holiday 10 days ago when it seemed almost certain that an air bridge would be in place with Greece. When the government officially announced it the holiday went up by £200 so I was happy I booked it before. With the extension of the restrictions from the Greek government and a lack of clarity from ours I'm considering transferring the holiday to Tenerife. However the prices for Tenerife have rocketed since the announcement no doubt in part due to the uncertainty travelling to Greece.
"Hi Nicksy,I think you misunderstand me.I wrote that death rates "" from all causes "" ( i.e.not just Covid-19) are at or below normal for most places in the UK.The virus is no worse now than seasonal influenza.There will be the occasional spike such as in Leicester ( it's interesting that many of the towns and cities with the highest R-rates also have a signicant Asian population but that's another story ) as there are in other countries in Europe such as Germany.But why Leicester has been put into lockdown when there was only a single Covid-19 death in the entire Midlands the previous day is beyond me.Increased figures are purely the artefact of increased testing.What you're seeing now is the last dying flicker of the lockdown lunacy before the country breaks out in celebration this Saturday."
"It feels a bit strange that if you get chosen to be tested you don't have to stay in 1 place for the 24 hours after being tested. I'm due to land at Mykonos airport at 19:45 and if I then get tested is it ok for me to: 1) stay in my Mykonos hotel room overnight 2) have breakfast in my room3) catch a ferry at 10:00 to Tinos4) explore the island in my hire car as I can't check into my Tinos hotel until 15:005) stay in my Tinos hotel room until the 24 hours has passed/c.20:00Is anyone able to advise?Also, if I was positive I'm assuming I'd then move to a quarantine place on Tinos. Does anyone know where these places are? There aren't that many hotels on the island so is it possible that my own hotel is one of the quarantine places?!Edited: 8:29 am, July 01, 2020 "
Several good points there Paul.I have read that if you are going onto another island or destination that you can do that as long as you have given your details but as you have put it if you can’t get to your room until later then what is the protocol?My trip in Sept involves landing in Athens then onward flight to Leros and I would be there by 11am. If I am not allowed into my room until later what do I do.
"KatomeriKaf - sounds like our scenarios are very similar - I also don't travel until September - at which point things could be very different. I was thinking that I'd have to book a 2nd night at my stop-over hotel on Mykonos (in case I get tested) before heading to Tinos, but it sounds like I won't need to and it will save me £120. Would be good for some clarification as to what's expected during the time you're waiting for your hotel room to be accessible.Edited: 9:15 am, July 01, 2020 "
A very high % of travelers land and continue the journey by ferry or airplane..this testing is sort of pointless...you continue moving on and if positive not only have potential spread on the arrival aircraft but then continue on to more spread on that ferry and airplane. Per post @879 my question would be how sophisticated is the contact tracing in Greece? For planeloads of holiday makers scattering all over? While Greece has done well with a contained population I seriously question that they are set up with the adequate contact tracing staff to really undertake this daunting task. Clearly here in US local governments are admitting they don't have the staff. I guess the bottom line is those that want to go will if their flight and hotel are still available to them...individual choice.
"This from the official government directive.QuarantineWed 7/1/2020 6:17 AM""The Greek authorities may require you to undergo testing for coronavirus, as part of health screening after you arrive in Greece. Any passenger entering Greece is liable to be asked to undergo a test, but you are likely to be asked if you have arrived from a country outside of the EU (including the UK), either directly or via indirect flights. If you are a British national who lives permanently within the EU, or have been in another EU country for some time before travelling on to Greece, you may be asked to prove that you have not recently travelled from the UK.After testing, you will need to self-isolate at the address given on your PLF form, filled out prior to your arrival in Greece. You will be contacted by the Greek authorities with your test results, and given further instructions (e.g. whether you are free to leave your accommodation, or must self-isolate for a longer period). If your test result is negative, you will no longer need to self-isolate. If your test result is positive, the Greek authorities are likely to ask you to self-isolate in government-provided accommodation for 14 days.You must comply with all instructions given by the Greek authorities. Failure to do so may result in you being refused permission to enter Greece and / or legal enforcement.You should also be aware that if other passengers on your flight subsequently test positive, you may be subject to further quarantine/ self isolation requirements. These will be mandatory and you should comply with the Greek Authorities’ requirements.""Important noteWhether you are tested or not, you could still be quarantined if anyone on your flight tests positive."
The last paragraph is very significant. That greatly increases the risk of being quarantined. I fully understand why these strict measures are in place and it will limit the amount of tourists willing to travel.
"I was told for Preveza airport so this serves Parga and Lefkada island, they have 2 hotels set aside one has 9 rooms the other 22 rooms, so i don't think they will be quarantining plane loads of people!"
"@889 these directives fail to deal with the location of the passengers as they fan all over from initial landing. They talk about all this quarantine etc. but do not have the facilities to do effective quarantine. I seriously question the ""honor system""of quarantine for tourist looking for a holiday after a very long winter/spring."
and the games continue...Greece wants a tourist season and tourist want no strings. I bet the tourists win.
Tourism is incompatible with testing and quarantines. What is surprising is that so many people in Greece do not realise that.
"Translation of the aboveA ""drama"" about the holidays of many Germans in Greece as ""TUI threatened to cancel all trips"" due to the new form that travelers have to fill in, Bild speaks in its online version.""According to exclusive information from Bild, the leader of the TUI tourist market threatened to cancel all its trips immediately.The reason: the controversy over an extreme quarantine directive of the Greek government.Randomly selected visitors would be tested at the airport for a corona test and then had to enter quarantine [36] for 36 hours until the results came out.But how do tourists spend 36 hours in quarantine?Hotels should create separate spaces so that customers do not have contact with others.They would have to take care of their own food (ss. Customers) and they would not be allowed to leave the hotel.TUI's manager was negotiating on Monday with Athens Tourism Minister Haris Theocharis.The group's message: With such a regulation we do not send customers to Greece.TUI has openly threatened to cancel all trips.The minister called Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in a hurry.He eventually withdrew.The quarantine regulation was withdrawn at the last minute and the holidays in Greece were saved.But what all vacationers need to know: Before arriving, they must fill out a form either electronically or through a form shared on the plane.A barcode must be indicated as proof of the electronic declaration.In addition, sampling tests will be performed at airports.However, these travelers can continue their journey normally until the results come out ""."
@895 i think the Greeks get it but are weighing benefit vs risk. The potential tourists are the ones that don't really get it and I can imagine the customer service complaints for those that test positive and there will be some ...no question.
"Tourists do get it, and they are cancelling in their droves. Nobody wants to go to a country where they are swabbed and quarantined on arrival when there are several others that don't do that. My friends are now in Croatia and are having a fabulous time. No testing or quarantine."
"TUI wouldn't be blackmailing Greece if their customers were not balking at the idea of being tested and quarantined. Wait till they start complaining about being imprisoned in quarantine hotels for several weeks.Edited: 12:21 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"@Yiassas and @KatomeriKaf: BILD is the German equivalent of The Sun. Which means not very trustworthy in what they publish. If they had such a problem with the Greek rules why did their CEO then sign an agreement yesterday in which they promise to do their utmost best to bring this summer 50% of their customers they brought to Greece last year?Edited: 12:26 pm, July 01, 2020 "
TIU can't bring 50% of last year's customers because their customers do not want to travel under such conditions. TUI can't force them.
#896.If the Greek government ever agrees to having an Air Bridge with the UK I guess the same protocol will be implemented. ...probably.I'm beginning to think with what has happened in Leicester and the serious possibility of other new regional lockdowns the Air Bridge with Greece is premature. Perhaps Boris can use his Wackarmole and save our holidays. The problem is once you Wackarmole another one appears in its place.
But Wackamole is a not very good name for a sensible policy at this stage of the pandemic.Ease lockdown but crack down on isolated spikes.It's what other countries besides the UK is doing.
"So what really changed after TUI kicked up a fuss, is it not now self isolating for 24 hours whilst waiting for result? Did seem a bit daft as its just random, can understand if positive."
"If they are ""cancelling in droves"" as indicated in @899 then the rest will fall into place...tour companies and airlines will cancel routes not making money and it will sort itself out."
"@906 if the ""isolated spikes"" locations get too many like in the US you are sort of starting over...with summer travel they will spread."
I totally agree. He was upbraided by Starmer at PMQ's for being flippant. Wackarmole is not a suitable description to be used by a PM when 60k people have tragically died.
At the end of the day folks we can only go by the rules of the countries we live in and those of the countries we plan to visit.Time will tell.
The PM's father Stanley has arrived at his villa in Northern Greece after flying in via Sofia in Bulgaria.Apparently the Greek authorities were happy with his journey.Good man Stanley.About time this lockdown hysteria was out into perspective.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-848…
"Well, at least we know who to blame if there's an outbreak in the Pelion!"
I suppose it could be anyone who travelled on the plane with him from Bulgaria ...
"I have a question, do me and my husband both need to complete one PLF each, or do I just do one and add him as a family member? Thanks"
#915 - from looking at the form yesterday my understanding is that you will just add him
"#915I did one for my whole family (x4), just kept clicking the add person button"
Thanks for that Andy. I thought that it was one form per person. presumably then you would get one QR code for your group?
"I assume so, however I haven't received a QR code yet"
Be good if this was clarified as the authorities won't be happy if not every traveller produces the code due to this misunderstanding.
"#920 I filled one for me and my daughter and another for my wife, I did this last Sunday and it was not clear at all, still didn’t get the QR code, but according to some posts here, we should get it 24 prior to out departure, all this misinformation is quite stressing."
I filled in one form and added my husband.
#924I dont think that is the case. You enter the age of each person. It does say only enter the ages of children.
"It's clearly mentioned in the blue section at the top of the Greek government website: ""ALL travellers are obliged to complete their PLF"". https://travel.gov.gr/#/I don't see a point for discussion there."
"@Nicksy - So why is there an option to add a ""travelling companion"" when completing the form?I'm afraid I do see an ambiguity there...Edited: 8:45 am, July 02, 2020 "
"I don’t recall the exact wording ( and the site is currently down to check ) however the first section was to add travellers from your household / family , then if applicable there was a section to add travellers not from your household . This allowed me to add my wife and children for example."
It may have been that terminology. I certainly didn't see anything to make me think that separate forms were needed for two adults who live in the same household.
"I've just checked. This is the actual wording:""Travel Companions - Family. Only include age if younger than 18 years""and on a subsequent page:""Travel Companions - Non-Family / Non-Same Household""So, it appears that only one form is needed for each group of people who are travelling together, and that ages need only be provided for family members if they are under the age of 18.Edited: 9:35 am, July 02, 2020 "
Does that mean that a family/same household if on the same form will share the same QR and therefore if one of you is selected for testing you all will be tested?
"No idea, I’m afraid. I would hope each person gets a separate QR. Thinking about it, though, I don’t think it really matters whether all in a group or just a single person are tested. Surely the outcome is the same?I would say they want to sample as many separate groups as necessary - rather than fulfilling the quota with many from one household. Perhaps that’s why they want to identify people travelling together?"
Thanks to whoever it was zapped my duplicate post #923 which explained why my post #922 was duplicate ( TA glitch) - it really wasn't necessary.
"#932 - I think it also depends upon what you'd do if someone in your group is positive and others aren't. Does the whole group move into quarantine, just the positive person on their own or some of you do and some of you don't? What a horrible scenario to have to think about at the start of your holiday!"
"In the event of a random test on arrival, will 7 day self isolation be required. If so what does it involve? Can you travel to your destination hotel? Are you allowed out? How do you get food etc? How is it policed?"
"Paul - I think you all go into quarantine for the whole 14+ days.#935 my understanding is that you travel to your final destination in Greece by whatever means you’ve booked/chosen and then you’re supposed to self-isolate there (along with the rest of your group) until the result. The missing piece of that puzzle is that others have said you’re only notified in the case of a positive result (which is supposed to be 24-36h). I have no idea how they envisage policing this or how they suppose you will get food for however long it takes.I’d want more clarity on all of these points before deciding whether to take my planned trip.Edited: 11:12 am, July 02, 2020 "
"#935 - 1 day self-isolation is required if tested. Yes you can travel to your hotel where you then have to stay in your room until the 24 hours is up. I guess you'd have to have room service or get some food on the way to your hotel. There are still lots of unanswered questions.Edited: 11:15 am, July 02, 2020 "
>> I have no idea how they envisage policing this <<That's why you have to give a tel° where they can call you. The police call you and ask you to show up at the frontdoor.
">> That's why you have to give a tel° where they can call you. The police call you and ask you to show up at the frontdoor.<<I understand the theory, but I question the reality!"
"Bernard, regular forum posters living in Greece can assure you that it was no theory the last few months. Of course if they will control everybody, that's another question. But I wouldn't risk the heavy fine for not complying to the self-isolation rule(s).Edited: 12:33 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"Nicksy, I am not advocating non-compliance, but I am questioning whether the Greek state has enough police to manage the number of people they are proposing to test.I had a quick glance at the international arrivals in Athens that were scheduled for today: it's around 50 flights. Say they test 10%, that's - conservatively - 20 people from each flight; a thousand people in overlapping 24h periods just from one airport that's connected to the rest of Greece. Add in the other international airports and the potential geographic spread and I think you'll see where my concerns are.(Of course, all my figures are guesses, because we simply don't know the testing rate or the number of flights that will come in if the season gets going.)"
Then cart you off in a police van???
"Take into account that there are people travelling on to small islands such a Tinos, Mykonos, Lipsi, Ikaria. The police force there will be informed of impending visitors and as there is very little crime in these places I would think that they would be more than eager for a bit of excitement and come a calling!"
I really hope you’re right. Luckily it’s not our government that’s organising this!
">>Say they test 10%, that's - conservatively - 20 people from each flight; a thousand people in overlapping 24h periods just from one airport that's connected to the rest of Greece.<<Some figures: Yesterday 2,500 tests were conducted at Athens Airport, 815 tests at Heraklion airport, 586 in Rhodes, 350 in Chania and in Corfu and 324 in Kos. A total of 5,889 tests were conducted to tourists at the country’s airports.https:/…"
"Hello,I have just watched an interview with the Greece tourism minister, Mr. Theocharis for a romanian tv station. He said: - people that are tested upon arrival are not compelled to isolate for 24 hours. They are only advised to be cautious, not to go to too many places.  - testing every romanian form yesterday's flights was just temporary , until the algorithm gathers enough data. (this might be the case for other countries as well ). Very soon they will only test some of passengers from each flight , based on the algorithm. - the algorithm will take into account the place where the tourist comes from and select accordingly.  - if only one member of a family is tested and the test comes back positive, then the other members will be tested.  - If all members of a family are tested and only one member is positive, than the other members don't need to quarantine. But they can all quarantine together if they want to.  - they allow people to enter without having filled in the PLF , but in this case they will automatically be tested.  - they officially left only one land border crossing open so they could test how well the system is implemented (Kulata). However they were flexible today and allowed tourists to cross through other points , but they asked that people use Kulata for now. In a short time they will open other land border crossings."
"#945. This is really informative and clears up a lot of quetions that I had, thank you very much!Edited: 4:14 pm, July 02, 2020 "
#945 - super helpful - thank you.
">>>Take into account that there are people travelling on to small islands such a Tinos, Mykonos, Lipsi, Ikaria.

Locals have been begging the Greek government, for years, to send more police to the island because the current small police department cannot provide the services and protection that are required, particularly during summer months. Every year more officers are promised, but every year nothing materializes. There is considerable crime on the island, including activity by organized crime groups from other European countries, so there's already enough ""excitement"" to keep the local police entertained -- they really don't need the added burden of keeping tabs on travellers who might not be isolating as required."
We are a group of 3 people traveling together by plane this Sunday. My understanding is that we all have to fill the PLF separately since passport numbers are required and then we have to name each others in each forms as travel buddies. Is that the way to go?I just read a previous message saying that one form per group is enough. Is that right? I'm afraid I just increased my chances to get tested by filling a form per passenger.
"I filled one for every member of the family, be it adult or child, using the same logic as you ( passport number required) . From the feed backs, the majority of people filled one for each adult and put the children on their parents' form. I think it is the same thing. If one is not supposed to fill one for the child, then they are not asked for their QR code upon arrival. You have them just in case, but you don't use them. Same with the rest of adults from the family actually. Have them all and only show more than one if you are asked for them. I think it is better to have them than not. The TV station put up the video with the interview this morning. This is the link https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/soci… . It's better to hear it first hand."

"I am a new poster but have being following this forum and must thank those contributors who have helped so much to clarify the situation in Greece. Special thanks to Nicksy - what an effort must have gone into putting the original advice and information together and also the updates.We are group of 6 with air tickets (booked 2019) from London to Greece on 27th July. We have been to the same small village in Greece for many years and have our self-catering accommodation booked. If Greece allows flights from England after 15th July (which is looking quite possible owing to our reducing Covid infection rate) then we are very much hoping to travel. However, our flights are London Gatwick to New Anchialos airport, Volos, which is a very small airport with very few arrivals and departures, (11 each week according to their website). There are no departures/arrivals showing. Does anyone know if Volos airport will be opening for flights please? I have checked the passenger arrival form and it does have a space to tick for Anchialos as an arrival airport. Many thanks in advance."
You don't say which airline you are travelling with but with many airlines rescheduling their routes or in some cases cancelling them I would have a look on their website and check with your booking that the flight is still going ahead.
Thanks for the reply. We are booked with Easyjet (Gatwick to Volos). The Easyjet site is showing flights as still going ahead (and bookable) after 15th July.
As far as I'm aware ALL airports are now open
Just announced that the UK is NOT requiring people to quarantine from Greece as part of 72 other countries allowed to travel to the UK. https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/full-list…
"Why doesn’t Greece publish details of the algorithm used to decide if we are high risk and so will need to be tested at the airport?They know before we travel (assuming we will be able to at some stage) if we are going to be tested. They base the decision in the form you have to fill out before departure. So why not tell us before we travel? Or let us fill out a dummy form.That way there are no surprises and we could decide early if we want the testing hassle!Edited: 2:21 pm, July 03, 2020 "
Totally agree. This would allow visitors to be more informed about whether it's worth taking the risk of travelling to Greece
"On the Greek Government's official website regarding the protocol for arrivals (https://travel.gov.gr/), in the FAQ section, I have read the following:""Q: Can a visitor provide the results of a molecular test (conducted up to 72 hours prior to arrival) to avoid being tested?A: Subject to evaluation, such tests can be accepted.""Many people have the concern that they could be testing positive and have to spend 2+ weeks quarantined in a hotel. A solution to mitigate this risk could be: take a test in your home country 1-2 days before your arrival.If you test positive there, you will obviously cancel your vacation, but you get to stay at home rather than quarantined in Greece; if you test negative, then you know that (unless you are incredibly unlucky) you will also test negative in Greece, or even better: you can show them the test from your home country and they will let you in without testing you in Greece, thus also avoiding the 24-hour quarantine (if that is actually mandatory). Taking the test will obviously cost you extra, but you will have peace of mind and you know for sure you will not end up quarantined for a full month.Obviously, it's stated that such tests ""can"" be accepted, not that they will for sure. But the same website also mentions that all travelers ""are obliged to complete their PLF"" and that all tested travelers ""are obliged to self-isolate"". The Tourism Minister said something else about both these topics in the interview, so I think they are quite relaxed about it, so I see no reason why they wouldn't accept a test from your home country."
"Who would want to travel and spend up to eleven hours wearing a mask, no food o drinks at the airports and on the flight. Get to destination and get tested, then isolate for further 24 hours, if self catering still no food, run risk of breaking some rule you are not aware of, pay fine. Spend rest of holiday worrying about doing it all again in reverse."
"Me! In the hope that 24 hours or so of stress is outweighed by.... souvlaki , crystal clear sea, sun and unprecedented relaxation."
Well said Mr l
"So, if you have to self isolate can you pick up your hire car and pop into a shop for some basics? If not how on earth are you supposed to get to your accommodation and live until the results arrive? And how long does it actually take for those results to arrive?"

"I think that there are a lot of answers needed before people will be confident with the risk of travelling to Greece. Not knowing exactly what to expect with a 24 hour quarantine, is certainly a worrying start to any holiday. Does the whole family/group have to isolate? How long do you have to wait for test results, full 24 hours, shorter, longer? Can you get food or drink whilst isolating? If you were picked to be tested, would the whole family/group also be tested? Regardless if I was tested or not, I would want to make sure that my family, the Greek people, and other holiday makers remain safe, by us minimising contact."
As the original post says ....“STAY at HOME to keep GREECE and the ISLANDS SAFE”
"Engineer9199, if everyone followed the Stay at Home advice, this would not aid the tourist economic recovery in Greece. I would personally like to see Greece as a tourist destination of the future. It would be great if people could start travelling back now in a sensible way. i.e. Only travelling if well, wearing masks as required, washing hands, and keeping distance from others.

"If you follow the link and watch the video in #950 Haris Theoharis clearly states that you don't need to isolate for 24 hours but be careful and don't go to too many places.Here in this link about the number of tourists testing positive it is back to how one woman broke the quarantine ……….. people just don't know which way to turn with what they need to do, very confusing.https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/07/03/greece-coronavirus-tourists-swedish-self-siolation-athens/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KeepTalkingGreece+%28Keep+Talking+Greece%29Edited: 3:51 am, July 04, 2020 "

"It was the aim of this thread to post as much OFFICIAL information as possible and as soon as possible. Meaning that the information comes from either the government, the Hellenic Coast Guard, the Greek Police or from the appropriate airlines and ferry companies. As it has become more and more a thread with guesstimates, assumptions and even many off-topic political comments, I will be asking TA staff to unpin it so it can go it's own course."
"#977The Greeks face no different problems than any other European country opening up its borders once again.It's a risk and reward situation.So far a lot of the rest of Europe which has been open for a few weeks now has not experienced a significant spike in the virus brought in by tourists.That's not to say it won't happen but ultimately the damage to the economy at some point far outweighs the potential risks.Edited: 7:20 am, July 04, 2020 "
Thank you Nicksy for all your efforts. Much appreciated as a source of real information.

Thanks to Nicksy & the others who have kept this thread mostly on track & factual. Well done.

">>Surely the whole point of a sticky is that the first post gets updated as and when new information comes in.<<Normally a sticky/pinned post is a post that remains on top of the forum and where it's not possible to add comments.Allthough for this one it was asked to TA to make it possible to add updates. Otherwise, everytime it was needed to update, it had to be closed, taken off the forum and put back with the new information. And that would have taken (sometimes a lot of) time with every change as the switching has to be done by TA administrators in the US.It could be that this thread still remains a few days as a pinned post on top of the forum.

"So from the cases that test positive are they then contacting everyone that might have been in contact with those people (people on the same flight, in the same hotel)? What is the fine for people found not to be isolating?"
Breaking quarantine rules incurs fines of up to 5 000 euros.
"It seems that from tomorrow 6:00 , until 15.07. , Greece has suspended the access for serbian citizens from all points of entry. Although it does not affect me, it still bothers me the easiness to have your plans turned upside down from one day to another. People with their bags packed and ready in their hallway for tomorrow's departure are now left with a heavy heart and so much disappointment to just unpack and put everything back.  Who knows who will be next?"
"I think everyone should read comments under this article, especially message from David who is now in a quarantine hotel due to two passengers testing positive on his flight""David 3 July 2020 at 14:40 ReplyIf we knew it before, I had cancelled our trip to Chersonissos area. We arrived on 1st of July and everything went fine on arrival. After scanning our QR’s we were all directed to the baggage belt and proceeded to our rented house. Yesterday evening I received a phone call,that two passengers on the same flight have been tested positive and today a shuttle arrived for our mandatory relocation to a quarantine destination. We are now really p* because that means, that even if you are not a risk candidate with full health they can quarantine anybody at any time. Our host tried to help us because we rent the same house since over 10 years and during this time Mikos has become a real friend. He said, that he fullfills every condition from the greek government including a dedicated doctor, but he couldn’t assist us in any manner to avoid relocation. We are now trapped and I’d like to share our experience to other people. I understand the security concerns to protect the local people, but they should inform about all possible scenarios in advance. We thought everything is fine, if you can leave the airport directly but that’s sadly not true.""https:/…"
">>it still bothers me the easiness to have your plans turned upside down from one day to another.When 12 passengers tested positive on a Qatar flight, the Greek government suspended flights to/from Qatar for two weeks with immediate effect so it was clear then that such a knee jerk reaction will happen again sooner or later.Edited: 10:48 am, July 05, 2020 "
"What happened to David is truly horrible. Hopefully he will just be tested and found negative, then released. And now again I change from wishing to not be selected for testing upon arrival, to wishing to be tested , just so we don't find ourselves in David's shoes. And wishing to sit in the first or last row, just so there is less people around who could test positive and ruin our holiday. Never in my life was my fate so out of my hands."
@995 while I am sure it is a disappointment I think anyone watching the news or following here on TA or other social media should not be surprised. This will be happening depending on numbers all over the world. Unless you are a really flexible traveler not sure this is the year to venture too far away from home. Not what most want to hear but it is the reality.
">>Although it does not affect me, it still bothers me the easiness to have your plans turned upside down from one day to another. <<That's the risk you take when you absolutely want to travel in the midst of a pandemic. Things you can't do anything about can suddenly change."
I do think the fact that we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic has been lost on many...in some respect this has been encouraged by our governments. To think anything is going to just go along as normal is not being realistic...
"I know this and I agree. I am a very positive and optimistic person so I decided to take the risk. Risk is part of life. But things seem different when the holiday is months or even weeks away. Up until about a week ago I was relaxed and confident. But as the day of departure approaches and we are only a couple of days away, I find myself more and more anxious. My mom asked me today when we are returning and I answered ""21st or who knows"":)"
"IoanaCorbeanca, Romania The whole point of a holiday is to reward your self or to go and relax and enjoy. I can't understand why you are going at all . Since a few weeks ago the borders of Greece were pretty much closed. Could some one please explain what has changed in the past few weeks that has allowed 21,000 passengers to pass through Athens Airport on July 01 and 54 international flight arrivals into Greece today alone. I seem to be missing something."
"Because I was willing to take the risk. Because by the time things started to worry me so much , not going would mean loosing around 3000 euros. Because cancelling would always make me think ""what if nothing bad happened, what if we went and had the beautiful holiday that we have planned , like many others are having"".You are right, the point of a holiday is to relax and enjoy. I was doing this until a few days ago. Hopefully these few days will be the only ones (of concern).  The flight is tomorrow at noon. I received last evening our QR codes. I'll write here about our experience."
"Having the risk of self isolation due to being in close contact is something that would put a lot of worry and anxiety to most people as they approach their holiday or start enjoying the first day or two.However Greece needs tourists, and tourists stand to lose quite a bit of money if they choose to cancel.Self isolating close contacts from airline seats is not something that will restore confidence to those wanting to holiday in Greece. This risk of this happening is low, but nobody would want to be affected by this. Bear in mind that transmission from asymptomatic cases is relatively rare, and noting that you could be in close contact with passenger's from other flights at the departure airport, I don't see much value in this approach."
"I decided to post an answer about questions I get via PMHello ..........Thank you for your kind words.Many tourists buisness are open in Sissi but not all.I am sure that the open buisness are enough for your needs.I don't see any Cretan to scare from tourists from any Nation.Many of Cretans are careful about the social distance, it doesn't matter if the others are Greeks or tourists.I think that from 15 July if not earlier flights from the UK will be allowed.If someone from family is tested positive then they make test also to all other family members.In quarantine stay only the positive members exept if all family decides to stay all together in quarantine.That is, if the positive members are asymtomatic, otherwise they need hospital.Even if UK follows different policy, I hope in winter time to visit UK especially the area from York and nothern!I wish you good decision and if you come to Crete to meet you!Best regards"
Here are masses of Greeks having a blast at a festival the other day. https:/…Here it is on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch…What's the point?
"I recently canceled my trip to Greece even though I was holding out hope things would get better. The final straw was my airlines (Swiss) canceling my return flight and offering an unacceptable flight home with a 16 hour layover instead of 2! Thankfully they offered me a refund which I'm still waiting for.I was leery from the very start about going to Greece but since I'm an optimistic type kept hoping my country would get it's act together and take the virus seriously. Then the EU ruled no American flights to the continent for now and I doubt that decision will change with the dramatic increase in the virus here.Enough was enough. It just wasn't worth the unknowns and the what ifs.Too many people were thinking they can now travel abroad as some European countries are re-opening and think they would not be affected by the virus either getting it, quarantined, or the hassle of having to deal with the virus when all you wanted was a fun holiday.I am disappointed I'm not going on my annual trip to Greece but for me it just wasn't worth all the issues involved with the virus.At least I have thousands of photos, dozens of videos and souvenirs from Greece to keep me optimistic for 2021 which I'm already planning for!Edited: 4:05 pm, July 06, 2020 "

Ioanna at #1004 would you start a new thread about your travel experiences? I feel it might get lost on this thread.
Please tell if anybody on the flight was tested...enjoy Crete
">>That's the risk you take when you absolutely want to travel in the midst of a pandemic. Things you can't do anything about can suddenly change.<<People who booked before COVID-19 arrived in Europe didn't know they would be travelling during a pandemic and if Greece is open for tourism they are only likely to get refunds if flights are cancelled or if their government advises against travel to Greece, so they are left with a choice of either go on holiday or lose money.In some instances airlines are allowing you to reschedule your flights including changing your destination but is it advisable to change your holiday in Greece for one in a higher risk destination where there's less chance of being forced to go in to quarantine? I'm not sure there is.Edited: 8:25 am, July 11, 2020 "
">>And wishing to sit in the first or last row, just so there is less people around who could test positive and ruin our holiday. Never in my life was my fate so out of my hands.<<So did they just quarantine the people sat close to the infected passengers? I'm aware some airlines are avoiding filling the middle seats on quieter flights (Easyjet being one) and I've heard Aegean are keeping the back couple of rows empty so that if someone starts to show symptoms on a flight they are moved to be 2m away from the other passengers."
"Fingers crossed that they change the rules around having to self-isolate for 14 days in your hotel room, if a fellow plane passenger is tested positive, but your test is negative!! I’m this close to cancelling my August holiday because of this rule."
"You only have to quarantine if someone your in close contact with test positive, so don’t cancel your holiday go and enjoy it."
"Does this mean within 2 rows of you on the plane front and back? I’m going solo and not reserved a seat, so hoping I get allocated a seat far from people (which I will ask for when checking in)"
"On the latest Greek government entry protocol it doesn’t mention anything about rows in front or behind ,just google Greek government entry protocol, I don’t know how to send the link sorry"
"Beginning July 1, 2020, the Greek government has determined how the country will welcome travelers, carry out the necessary diagnostic screening and keep everyone safe throughout the season.The Passenger Locator Form (PLF) is a key element in the planning. As of July 9th 2020, all travelers must complete their PLF at least 24 hours before entering the country, providing detailed information on their point of departure, the duration of previous stays in other countries, and the address of their stay while in Greece. In case of multiple stays, they are required to provide the address for the first 24 hours at least.Travelers will receive a confirmation email upon submission of the PLF.Travelers will receive the PLF with their unique Quick Response (QR) code on the day of their scheduled arrival in Greece (at midnight) and will be notified via email (the QR code will be provided in a link in the confirmation email).The PLF can also be found on the Visit Greece app and at travel.gov.gr.It is strongly recommended that all visitors download the Visit Greece app (GDPR compliant) for free, prior their arrival in Protocol for air arrivals(top)Arrival at the entry gate.Transfer to the area where the screening personnel are located. Travelers are requested to show their QR code either on their mobile phone screen or in print. If travel departure begins prior to the day of arrival, travelers are allowed to board after showing the confirmation email (and not necessarily the QR code which is scheduled to arrive during their trip.)Depending on their QR code/confirmation, travelers are directed either to the screening area where they will be tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by a trained health team or to the exit (to baggage claim area or passport control).Upon completion of the test, travelers are directed towards the exit (to baggage claim area or passport control).The test results are expected to become available within 24 hours. During that time, passengers who are tested are advised to practise social distancing according to local guidelines and self monitoring for symptoms that could indicate COVID-19. In case of such symptoms, medical advice and/or contact with the National Public Health Organization (EODY) Operations Centre should be immediately sought. Only in case they test positive, the authorities will contact them and proceed with the health protocol in place. Otherwise, they may continue with their holidays, adhering to the general public health safety guidelines.If travelers plan to have multiple stop-overs in Greece, they must declare this and report their initial destination and their travel itinerary for the next 7 days.All travelers must comply with all of the necessary preventive hygiene measures (use of masks and physical distancing) according to local guidance."

"Hi, I have a question. In August I will be traveling to Greece with my family for our vacation where we will hire a rental car. We are a family of 4, my parents, my little sister and myself. We all live together in the same house. I get a little worried because I read that in Greece you can only travel with 1 passenger in a car with 5 seats. Minors are excluded from this. Does this also apply to families with children of age?"

I am due to travel to Crete from London with my husband in about 3 weeks...has anyone gone through Heraklion airport and been stopped to be tested for Covid?
"#1026. Yes, indeed they have. Familiarise yourself by browsing through the Crete forum, so many relevant posts to choose from!!And be sure to complete and submit a PLF for each of you.Edited: 9:48 am, July 23, 2020 "
We were travelling from Australia into Greece for July and obviously cannot due to Covid.All accommodation were fantastic in providing refunds and we would be pleased to go back there next year.RyanAir would not respond to emails re flight cancellations and kept our money.Would anyone know of another contact point of RyanAir (Athens) to approach for refunds.Greg
"#1028. Pleased to hear the hotels reimbursed you no problem. So, your Ryanair flight. Where was that from and to? Did it still fly? If it did, then wouldn’t you just be classed as a ‘no-show’ and need to use your holiday insurance for a refund, citing that you could not travel against your own country’s Foreign Office advice. If Ryanair cancelled the flight, then that is another matter altogether and you’d be due recompense from them."
We have just been to Paleochora Crete from 19th to 29th July. We only paid up front for the flight and airport parking so we did not have a large sum of money on the line if something went wrong. At the moment it's a buyers market so even if you turn up with nothing booked you could easily find somewhere to stay. We booked a studio with no deposit at the Lissos Hotel where we have often stayed before. The Covid 19 rate in Greece at the moment is very low and it's unlikely that if you go now you will have to self isolate on your return after a one or two week visit
"#1028 Hi you need to go onto secure.livechatinc.com I am on it currently trying to get a refund, its good because when you go in it it tells you how long you have to wait to get through, if it freezes start again, you get through eventually, good luck :)Edited: 5:47 am, July 31, 2020 "
"I am surprised that the hotels offered refunds. I have almost US $5,000 in deposits for hotels that I was planning on using in September. When I tried to cancel, I was told that due to the Greek Law that was passed in April, I would not get a refund but would be provided a voucher that could be used for 18 months. As i understand the law, if the voucher is not used in that period, then the hotel will refund mymoney. I understand these are difficult times but when I booked these hotels, I was not planning on providing an interest free loan to the hotels in Mykonos and Santorini for 18 months. Very disappointing."
"Grtgatsby I guess other hotels have the ability to do so more than others.If you booked a non refundable rate, the hotel expected that you either show up or not, they would not have to return the money to you so they may not have that money unfortunately. I hope you manage to reschedule your trip for the near future."
"All of these hotels offered a 30 day cancellation notice and I cancelled 45-days out so under normal circumstances, they would have been required to return my deposit. Simply due to COVID, the lawmakers have allowed companies to hold our funds to help businesses stay afloat."
theres no point trying to call ryanair athens. RyanAir is an Irish company.try this: https:/…contact-us you can send in claim forms from the above link
"aren’t any of your hotel bookings made onbooking.com or expedia and cancellablethru them if you picked the “cancellable” option?Like others, do you agree that Americans willnot be allowed in this year??"
"I booked all of my reservations directly with the hotels as I have stayed at each of them before. I don't think Americans will be allowed into Greece this season. The Greek authorities update the countries they will allow access every 15 days or so. Given the significant number of cases we have in the US and the delays in testing, I do not see anyway we will be allowed to travel to Greece until later this year (at the earliest). Most of the airlines have cancelled flights from the US to Greece through September. So we are planning to just go next Summer."
I can't remember that last time I booked any accomodation anywhere that wasn't on Booking.com and with free cancellation.Most times I book well in advance at the higher cancellable rate and if I can't find anywhere better and cheaper I cancel last minute and re-book and pay in full at the lower rate.Doesn't everyone do this these days ?
"Wahaay: not everybody, obviously, but I do & wouldn't consider anything else!"
"In July I booked accommodation directly with the owner for a trip in September. My fingers are firmly crossed that we will still be able to travel. However relevant to those people having difficulty getting their money back for accommodation, this is what she emailed me when I made the booking.""I wanted you to know that all the hotels ( and apartments) that are officially open this year, in case of lockdown or the guest cannot come because of no flights etc, have to give a voucher for up to 18 months or to give the money back. ( Whatever the client wants). A lot of hotel owners try to give the voucher and not the money. Even so, if /when, the 18 months pass and the clients have not come to the hotel, then they must give the money back ( at last). This is the official government direction.""So you can demand your money back now, rather than accept the voucher."
Arnaki - do you happen to know if/where this info is on an official site please?
"Hi Bigbum (that sounds so impolite!)I've tried to find the directive, but my Greek is most definitely not up to understanding the Greek coronavirus legislation.This site mentions vouchers only and has the link to the regulations in Greek.https:/…This site indicates a right to money back if the hotel cancels, but vouchers if you cancel. https:/…travel-refundsWhich? Magazine suggests that you do have a right to a refund, but this is for UK and/or EU residents.https:/…20 I don't imagine my host is deliberately doing herself out of income. She hasn't even taken a deposit. Another accommodation I am staying in also says we can have our money back in case of Covid related inability to travel (eg government prevents us or local lockdown prevents travel), but she has taken a deposit."
"Personally, I choose not to book with Booking.Com as they charge a 15% commission and I prefer the funds to go directly to the owners/operators. In this case, it did not serve me well :-) I am definitely sensitive to the challenges that COVID has on the travel and tourism industry. My understanding is people can demand an immediate refund but it is still up to the hotel to give it or not. They are protected by the law should they decide not to return the funds immediately. I have accepted the reality and am looking forward to getting back to a sense of normalcy over the next 6-9 months and return to Greece next summer. Stay safe and healthy.Edited: 10:33 am, August 14, 2020 "
