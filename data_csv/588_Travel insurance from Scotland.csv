"If you are able to buy travel insurance that will cover you for your travel. You should contact that same travel insurance and explain. Ask your travel insurance, they will know.Have a good holiday."
You can fly from Scotland that hasn't been stopped and flights go everyday. What the first Minister has delayed is scrapping the need to self isolate for 14 days on your return. So you are free to fly in and out but might need to isolate on return. However its likely she will scrap the isolation rule very soon.
Thanks that’s made it more clear now

someone asked bbc 1 this morning if they could travel to manchester from scotland and fly to spain and simon calder said you would not be allowed to do that as you have to give your details of where you live and you would not be insured if anything happened .
