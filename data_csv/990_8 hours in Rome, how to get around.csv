"Hello,i am going to fly to Italy next week, Naples, but i will have an 8h break in Rome, so i would love to see the most important sites in Rome, while waiting for my flight.I am not interested in the Vatican or any churches for that matter, just Roman history, so the pantheon, Colosseum, Forum of Trajan etc. , my question is, which is the best (and more cheap) way to get from the Airport to Rome itself and back in time?Grazie"
"8 hours is not ideal timing - it would be better if it were a longer layover. You have left out a lot of details:1) what is the origin of the first flight? will you need to go through passport control on arrival in Rome?2) what Rome airport are you flying into? 3) are your two flights on the same ticket or separate tickets?4) will you have luggage with you that you need to store?The cheapest way from either airport to the city center will be by bus. However, that mode of transit is not the fastest way and the destination is Termini station which isn't located next to the Colosseum."
"I would prebook a City Tour. If affordable for you, the ideal way would be a private tour with a pickup at the airport upon a arrival.and with a return to the airport. Please consider, that most likely a 2 hour check-in will be required along with immigration.. You do need to verify your check-in times for your continuing flight.The cheapest way takes time. You will navigate on your own, through immigration, to the bus station and sitting on the bus during the various stops along the way.The final statement to this situation, is with little time and wishing to see as much as possible, you need to spend the Euros and do it your way with a car and driver who will take you there.. Otherwise, you enjoy the ride between the airport and central city commuting."
"Hello, thanks very much for your reply,For the questions:1) Iam flying from Frankfurt to Rome, having an 8 hour wait, then to Naples for a week.Im within the EU, so there wont be any immigration controls, probably some corona controls maybe.2) Sorry that i did not add the airport, its the Rome Fiumicino Airport.3) I booked both flights at once, im not sure yet as my tickets are not there yet.4) Im only traveling with hand luggage, so i take everything on to the plane with me, but i heard you can store your stuff for relativly cheap at the airport.I dont want to see everything, but it would be nice to use the spare time in Rome.Thank you again for the reply."
"OK - your follow-up answers make the timing a bit better.Before COVID-19 times, it was generally recommended to arrive at FCO 2 hours early for destinations within the Schengen area. You should check with your airline to see if this timing is still suitable with all the COVID-19 protocols. Yes, there is a staffed luggage storage facility at both FCO airport and Termini train station that are conveniently located. Because their location is convenient, however, they both get used a lot. Sometimes, there can be very, very long queues at the desk - probably not as much of an issue right now during the pandemic. Normally I would allow an hour to pick up your luggage because you don't want to miss your flight while you were standing in line for your luggage. You will want to double check these services are available right now - I had noticed that the storage facilities at some major train stations were temporarily closed due to COVID-19.FCO is not in central Rome. You will either need to take a car (taxi or private car transport), the Leonardo Express train, a local train or bus. The trip will probably be 45 minutes to 1 hour one way by car (although it could be as little as 35 minutes during nonpeak hours to 1 hr 30 minutes during peak rush hour due to traffic). If you take the Express train, you don't have to worry about traffic - it is about a 30 minute trip one way. Unfortunately, the Express train is operating on a reduced schedule. Normally, express trains run every 15 minutes - right now Express trains run every hour - making it a bit less convenient with these layover type transfers. It appears the local train departing from FCO is running on a full schedule - you may want to check out the local suburban train for your transfers. I would budget at least 2 hours for your transfer from the airport to Rome and then back to the airport. So your 8 hour layover equates to about 3-4 hours sightseeing time in Rome. That assumes your flight from Frankfurt arrives on time. You should have enough time to walk around Rome for a little bit - see the Colosseum from the outside, Trevi fountain, etc.For future trips, I wouldn't fly from Rome to Naples - fly into Rome and then train to Naples.Edited: 2:41 am, July 09, 2020 "
Cancel the flight to naples.Take the express train to termini. Visit Rome. Then head back to termini and take the train to naples. Best use of your time. If you hadn't booked the second flight the train is likely cheaper. Even now the express back to fco might be more expensive than the train to naples
"Flying Rome to Naples is insane. But if too expensive to cancel your flights, you may need to take that flight because if you don't, your onward flights may be forfeited. The last time I travelled from Rome to Naples, it was just over an hour city centre to city centre and cost about 10euro for an advance purchase ticket.I reckon the best way to see something of central Rome is to just walk. Grab a map and go. You could potentially take a bus or metro to a particular location and walk from there. When checking for local trains to/from the airport, check trenitalia website looking for services to Roma Termini (the main station), Roma Trastevere or possibly Roma Tiburtina but check where these are on the map before deciding which suits you best. Leonardo Express is normally the quickest, I believe, but also more expensive."
"Thanks again for all the replies!I sadly cannot cancel the flights anymore, it would be way too expensive.The stopover in Rome to Naples is stupid, i know, but i might as well use it to see get to see a few things instead of just sitting at the airport for 8 hours.I have an question about the Leonardo Express, as the websites are all in only italian, where do i find the right train and purchase tickets? Also, am i going to be lost if i dont really speak italian?I can spend some money for the short trip, but still be <100€.Another note: My flight will arrive in Rome Thursday at 13:45 and depart again at 21:45 if everything goes to plan.I never was to the Airport in Rome or Rome itself. I would guess that i should be back at the Airport Terminal at around 19:30, not later to be safe.Best regards,Edited: 7:19 am, July 09, 2020 "
">>the Leonardo Express, as the websites are all in only italian<<That is incorrect - there is an English version. If you can't find it, then you may be looking at a reseller instead of the actual train company's website.As I stated before, I would skip the Leonardo Express due to its severely reduced schedule. Unless you want to spend a good portion of your sightseeing time waiting for the next train.....sort of defeats the purpose of taking the Express train if you are going to wait around for 30-45 minutes.Don't prebook train tickets to the suburban train - just buy when you are there. You don't even know if you flight will be on time or be delayed. You should play this whole side trip by ear."
There is a train station at the airport. Follow the signs. At the station you mostly have only two trains. The express or the FL1. There are ticket machines at the station and normally a ticket booth. I think the machine can be switched to English but I don't remember.
I seem to think that the machines are also in English but if not then you can go to a ticket counter and ask.
"Okay, thanks for the replies,so the local train it is then, if my arrival plane is punctual, that is.If the luggage department isnt crowded, i would give my stuff up, otherwise take it with me.My concern is that i might get lost either after coming to the roman main station or take too much time finding the right train back to the airport.With best regards,"
"take the train express to city center then take metro to stop colosseo metro there you can see all the history , also take the metro to spagna stop to see spanish steps and back using the metro to termini then train back to airport or a taxi I think you can do it if you have a plan and since you are from the eu I think you can use your mobile data (limited ) within the eu so use the GPS I have a terrible sense of direction yet I manage with a pre-plan and the online maps as for italain you really don't need it (would be nice if you know grazie= thank you and prego= you are welcome, bougiorno=good morning) most people in tourist center speak English and if not they will try to point to help you out , the leonerd express you pay more money compared to normal train so you can easily spot it always ask ticket office or security for platform number if confused and be careful or people who are not official employees who try to approach you near the ticket machine to ask for money or take money (the normal precautions), I hope you have fun and good luckedit: one thing i forget to mention is that recently i think Italy started not allowing hand luggage on their flights (into italy and within italy) they only allow small bag or laptop bag due to corona and every thing else (normal hand luggage) is checked free of charge so check that information because i'm not sure if that rule is applied or not because then you will need more time to wait for your bag on belt from frankfurt to rome unless they check it for you all the way to naplesEdited: 10:00 am, July 09, 2020 "
"Thanks for the reply, especially for the detailed description!For the latter part, there is some conflicting information provided by my airline: https:/…hand-baggage.htmlFor once it is now not allowed to store hand luggage in the upper compartments, but you can still take them with you, under the seat i guess? Also a small secondary bag as well, which i will take with me.I just hope that i can take both parts of luggage with me, so i will not be waiting for it to arrive per belt.The plane is an E175, if that helps.Grazie,"
"The ticket kiosks are multi-lingual. Some take cash and cards but some card only. The automated kiosks are pretty easy to use and show you a range of options (time and price) so you can choose which suits you best.Particularly at Termini, it can sometimes pay to be a little bit wary of unofficial offers of assistance with the kiosks but sometimes there are staff on hand.If the platform (binario) is not shown when you buy the ticket, you should find it on the overhead display.If looking at options from home and using trenitalia, it's a very easy site to use but you must use Italian place names. For you this means typing in, say, FIUM (first few letters are enough) to ROMA T (or wherever you want to go.Rome is a wonderful city for just wandering around so enjoy! With limited time you could perhaps take public transport to somewhere like Trastevere or the Vatican area and meander back towards the train station so as to be sure as to not miss your train to the airport.Are you spending your holiday in Naples?"
"Dino, here's another idea that might work for you. . . Fiumicino is actually very close to Rome's ancient port of Ostia Antica. You could grab a train going the other direction (toward the coast) and spend 2 or 3 hours seeing the old port city, which is eye-popping. And then maybe spend another couple of hours on a nearby beach before returning to the airport for your flight. And save Rome for another time when you've got more time to spend.I only mention Ostia as an option that you'll be able to cover at a leisurely pace while seeing most of it, but if you've got your heart set on going into Rome, I won't try to dissuade you. Eight hours in Rome is better than a week in most places."
"Thanks for all the replies again!Jackie, if my flight will be delayed more than 1-2h, i will probably head out to the coast and to Ostia. How long does it take to pick up your luggage, as im now sure that i will have to give it up at the check-in at FRA and later pick it up again because of that italian regulation."
">>How long does it take to pick up your luggage<<Under pre-COVID-19 conditions, it was widely variable. It could be 15 minutes or 3 hours. Due to COVID-19, passenger numbers are way down so hopefully it makes the baggage handling process smoother."
"@Escape9876Can i buy both tickets (i.e to Rome and back to the airport) at once, so i already know when to be at the station to catch the train?"
"There are Youtube videos that capture the whole process - walking from the Terminal to the train station, buying tickets, etc. Some are better than others - if the first one you click on isn't very good, click on a different one."
"I informed myself about the schedule of the Leonardo Express, while the train only departs every hour, it still is a better or rather easier option, for a little more money.My only question is that i found two websites for the tickets, firstly the Trenitalia webiste, which shows the exact time of the train departing, which makes me wonder if my plane is late, is my ticket still valid for the next one or only for that exact express train?Then there was the site: leonardoexpress.rome.ticketbar.eu , there i could buy a ticket (and return) for a whole day, but im not sure if thats really the site of the leonardo express. or am i wrong?Lastly, is it even necessary to buy an ticket online, or can i certainly get one at the machine/ticket booths for both to Rome and back to the airport, im just trying to be 100% sure to get a seat.Big thanks for all the help until now!"
">>it still is a better or rather easier option<<This comment doesn't make any sense. How is one train ""easier"" than another train?Hopefully the timing works out for you where you don't have to wait too long on your trip to and the return trip from the city center. It just seems to me that you want to waste a good portion of your very limited time waiting on two trains. Well - it is your time and your money.Pre-COVID-19, it would not be recommended to pre-purchase your train tickets online when you could easily purchase them at the train station. With the extremely limited Leonardo Express schedule and social spacing - I don't know how close they are to selling out certain journeys. You might want to pack a four leaf clover or a rabbit's foot for luck.If you decide to pre-purchase, I wouldn't buy from any resellers - only the official Trenitalia website."
"If you end up taking the Leonardo Express and transit through Termini and are hungry, you may want to check out Mercato Centrale Roma. It is a modern style food hall with all sorts of local vendors and restaurants."
"Thanks for the reply, i wanted to ask if the Leonardo Express ticket is valid for an entire day, or for one specific train at a given time.Thanks"
