"Hi there,I have been scouring the internet for clear regulations regarding my situation, but I've had no luck so I thought I would try Tripadvisor.I'm a US citizen beginning school in Belgium this September. My type D visa is in process and I expect to receive it soon. Meanwhile, I need to book my plane ticket. By far the most affordable tickets are through TAP Air Portugal and Icelandair. I have not been able to get any information from Air Portugal, and I have read on this form that Icelandair will not allow me to have a layover in Reykjavik, although they might make an exception if I can ""demonstrate my residency"" in Belgium. However, it's my understanding that I won't receive residency documents until I'm actually in Belgium -- I could only show them my type D Belgian visa. I also don't trust Icelandair because they lost my baggage once under ridiculous circumstances and dealing with them about it was hands down the worst airline experience I've ever had.I'm low on funds. If I -can- have a layover in Portugal, my ticket will be ~$300. If Iceland works out, ~$500. If I have to fly direct to Belgium, ~$1500. So that's what's at stake here.Anyone who knows the deal more precisely and can send me any relevant links: much much appreciated. Thank you!"
"If you're considering transiting Portugal, a COVID (molecular) test also seems to be required prior to travel, so factor that in as well if you haven't already:https://www.flytap.com/en-us/latest-updates…"
"Yes, just saw that, which seems to mean Portugal is an impossibility because testing has to have been in the last 72 hours, and in the US it takes much longer. Thanks Trump"
"Honestly, I realize it may cost more but I think you’re only safe bet is a nonstop flight from the United States"
"There don't seem to be any nonstop and direct flights from BOS to BRU in early September, but Brussels Airlines are offering a nonstop direct flight from JFK. As it's a codeshare with UA and LH the fare may be (stress that) lower by booking with one of those carriers.'If I have to fly direct to Belgium, ~$1500.' A single from JFK to BRU can be bought from $US 667 although you'll need to add the cost of the positioning flight.Given the faff involved in making a flight with connections I too would choose the nonstop direct flight and consider it money well spent. Book only with the airline (no matter which chosen) rather than any third party booking site."
"Well, Iceland Air is quite wrong about needing to demonstrate residency in Belgium. One of the exemptions to the current entry restrictions for travelers from countries not on the approved list is ""third-country nationals travelling for the purpose of study.""Source: https:/…exemptions-from-travel-restrictions Be that as it may have you explored the options and costs of flying into other cities with a convenient train connection to Brussels? Amsterdam would be the easiest with frequent trains from the airport, followed by Paris and Frankfurt."
I wouldn't book any flights until you get your visa though.
"As others have said, consider flying into Amsterdam which has a train station underneath the terminal with direct trains to Brussels - you may find a cheaper fare as AMS gets more flights than BRU."
"If you do look at flights from JFK/Newark, you can take Amtrak from Boston to NYC and get a NJ Transit train to EWR or an LIRR train to the JFK AirTrain at Jamaica. That's what I often do from up here in Albany. Amtrak is currently having a sale with $29 tickets between Boston-NYC."
"I would go for a TAP flight from Boston to Amsterdam with a layover in Lisbon ($300+). As suggested above, a train ride from Schiphol to Brussels Central is around $30+.Edited: 5:06 am, July 31, 2020 "
"Lenny,Since the OP was concerned about his budget, I recommended a one stop flight with TAP ($300+) as opposed to the direct flight with Air France/KLM which is more than double the price. Personally, I would take the direct flight but the OP may opt for the cheapest flight instead.Edited: 7:04 am, July 31, 2020 "
"I also would seek out direct flights. the BOS to AMS option is solid, as the train from Schipol airport is cheap and easy, then directly to the train to Brussels, from Centraal station. It is a stressful time to be going away. I would 100% wait to book anything until you have the visa, but also to make sure the flight looks sure to take off. Way too many stories of flights being booked, cancelled by the airline, and refunds not arriving in any kind of speed.You are aware that Brussels is experiencing a resurgence of covid, with new restrictions in place? Also a 14 day quarantine is advised."
"I can't see the departure airport, but the regulars seem to think it's BostonIn which case Delta offer a non stop direct flight BOS-AMS for $540 on KLM metal, and it's $600 with a checked bag. From there it's an easy train trip, and if that's where you're leaving from an easy decision IMO.You really do not need added stops, covid tests, or any other obstacles hanging over this trip like a dark cloud, not in these trying & ever changing times.Edited: 10:47 am, July 31, 2020 "
I don’t know when you have to be there but I would schedule to arrive several days early. Expect to have flights delayed or even canceled and rebooked. Give yourself a good cushion
"Thanks for the advice, everyone. The Amsterdam option is smart, hadn't thought of that.Yes, I know I'll be going from NYC (or Newark) instead of Boston.A Belgian friend told me the Lisbon airport is a free zone and linked me to various sites clarifying that. But I still haven't heard back from the Portuguese embassy or TAP Portugal... Too bad they don't post clarifying information about layovers for third-country people who have visas in their final destination anywhere on their sites."
"Watch for quarantines, restrictions and changing measures as the situation evolves if you chose to stop in another country, especially if you intend to change means of transportation. Personally, if it were me, I would prefer a direct flight."
"The EU has made a very comprehensive website that lists, per EU country, whether you can enter, transit, travel around freely within the country etc etchttps://reopen.europa.eu/en/"
"You will be required to show a negative covid-19 test at check-in with Tap Portugal done within 72 hours from departure. If you can make this requirement happen, travel with them, otherwise flying straight to Belgium sounds like a much better option."
"""The test is not asked in Portugal for those who are in transit and do not have to leave the airport facilities"""
"We got the visas, and indeed they cancelled our flight from JFK to BRU without even notifying me -- I logged in to check on some details and caught the cancellation.Paid them another $600 -- so now we're up to $2000 total for 2 tickets, without bags -- to switch to a direct United flight the next day.But now that TAP have actually clarified that connecting travelers don't have to present a COVID test, we may cancel our Lufthansa tickets for a refund and save $1700 by flying TAP... I am worried, though, that TAP's regulations could suddenly change anytime!"
"""Paid them another $600 -- so now we're up to $2000 total for 2 tickets, without bags -- to switch to a direct United flight the next day.""I hope for you that you bought the tickets directly from the airline.""we may cancel our Lufthansa tickets for a refund and save $1700 by flying TAP"" You have paid so far USD 2000. You want to save USD 1700 by flying with TAP. That would make around USD 150 per flight. I do not believe that one second.I would stick to what you have. If you have bought tickets not directly from the airline, then tripple check that all is fine and do not even think about changing anything.If you have bought the tickets from the airline, check what the cancellation fees are and what a new ticket would cost you. Be also aware that refund can take a long time during these Covid-19 times."
"Yep, buying from the airlines in each case.Yes, pretty unbelievable that it's $250 a person for our basic fare on TAP. But that's how it is! Look it up, NYC to BRU. Not even an atypical fare. We should've gone with them to begin with. Cancellation with TAP isn't a feasible option though as their fees are as much as the fare.Verified that we will receive full refund from Lufthansa (as much as one can be sure that what customer service tell you over the phone is true, anyway). They say 6-10 weeks."
