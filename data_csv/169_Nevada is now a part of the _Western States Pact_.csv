"From Governor Sisolak's Twitter page:https:/…1254802882995486721""Today, Nevada is joining California, Colorado, Oregon & Washington in the Western States Pact. I believe sharing information & best practices on how to mitigate the spread, protect the health & safety of our residents,& reopen responsibly  will be invaluable."""
"Makes sense, its not like the tiny Northeast states where you can drive between several in a few hours, but there is a lot of movement between these states in this region. Good to keep them all on the same page."
"^ True. And it seems like Jared Polis has some ideas for slowly but surely reopening Colorado.Wonder why Utah, Arizona and Idaho aren't included?"
Im guessing that this map explains it.https:/…president
"Because Utah, Arizona, and Idaho have far less cases than CA and Washington. Also, politically they are quite different aka Republican vs Democrat. To be fair, if you removed the major cities from CA it would be a deep red state. Same with Nevada, take out Las Vegas and it is basically West Virginia or Mississippi level red."
"50% of you won't agree with me but this simply makes it all that more political. Right or wrong, these democratic governors won't be relaxing any real restrictions anytime soon. Sadly, politics does play into this even though they constantly say it won't.Edited: 1:08 pm, April 27, 2020 "
">>Same with Nevada, take out Las Vegas and it is basically West Virginia or Mississippi level red.<<Although, Las Vegas has been called the Mississippi of the West.(Google it)"
Of course we need to hold hands with other politically minded states. This guy is the worst. Heaven forbid they each make their own decision for what fits their State. This is an easy way to share the blame and avoid being responsible. Weak AF.
I did and it makes sense. 1950's and 60's Vegas wasn't kind to black Americans or any minorities.
“ 1950's and 60's Vegas wasn't kind to black Americans or any minorities.”As opposed to the rest of the country where it was all sunshine and roses?
"It shouldn't even just be what fits your state but individual counties. It isn't like someone in Modoc County CA is nearly as effected by C-19 as someone in LA, and I doubt many LA residents are going up counties they have never even heard of that are basically a day and a half drive away just so they can sit down for dinner at the local IHOP. If these officials truly cared about their constituents, they would forego their salaries for as long as their states are shutdown. Solidarity is important, as is following the rules you expect your citizens to follow. The Mayor of LA never wears a mask during his televised speeches, with the one exception being the first time he rolled up the mandate. The Mayor of Chicago got her hair cut. The let them eat cake attitude is never acceptable."
"""To be fair, if you removed the major cities from CA it would be a deep red state. Same with Nevada, take out Las Vegas and it is basically West Virginia or Mississippi level red.""And to be fair and transparent you can't take those cites out of the states. As you have stated states should have more power and that means the majority rules. Voters are voters no matter where they live."
"Irish, did anyone say it wasn't?"
"@BigYou are correct, states should have more power. However, the states should be drawn so that they correctly represent the people there whenever possible. Coastal CA and interior CA are night and day. Same with Northern NY and Southern. Northern VA and DC should be a state of its own. People should be allowed to live in a state that adequately represents their views and is manageable in size. Alturas Ca to Sacramento is almost 300 miles. San Diego to Sacramento is 500 miles. CA or Texas for instance is larger than many countries. I have no desire to demand the people of Berkeley CA live how I want for example. Let the Bay Area be communist for all I care, just don't force a part of CA is the 90% Republican to live that way also."
"Everyone is freaking out about hair salons, bars, and casinos when we should be really looking at the food shortage that is around the corner. Farmers destroying produce and livestock is a real issue!!! States need to open by the county. Farms and agriculture is being destroyed because of blanket style governing."
@PnSSo you just want extra states to fit your narrative? Hundreds of years of states how states were formed not good enough for you? What makes people live in a state they dislike? Move . I know it's hard to move for many reasons but it can and is done millions of times a year. Why do you still live there? Your answer might be you will move eventually but not now? Time isn't right? If CA is so bad why is it by far the most populous state? Is it because what they offer and their economy would be by itself one of the top 5 in the world? Just asking. Now I will talk about my home state. If northern NY seperated from southern Ny it would be a disaster for them. Where do you think the money comes from to support those counties. Not from themselves. Just laughable.
"Big you seem to miss the part where I said let DC along with Northern VA become a state. That is two extra Senators for the Dems right there. Money is important, but it isn't everything. One good thing about the virus is it shows exactly how valuable the fly over states are. Things might have to be adjusted a bit, but I'd wager the rural states would do just fine on their own. Was planning to move. We were looking at places back east in December. The virus threw a wrench into everything. CA has its charms for people that want to live there. I will say the areas outside the cities are beautiful. There is a lot to do in the cities, beaches are a plus, and I'll miss the Mexican food. However, I care more about low taxes and the ability to exercise my 2nd Amendment rights than I do being able to get a decent burrito."
"""Big you seem to miss the part where I said let DC along with Northern VA become a state. That is two extra Senators for the Dems right there.""You seem to miss my point about NYS that YOU brought up. Those counties and part of the state could NEVER survive on their own. Just saying. I believe the same could be said about CA."
"The release of lockdown needs to be on a much more granular level than statewide. I've spent a lot of time looking at the geographic data provided by my state and county, and there are local areas that haven't had a new case in over a week. There are places with big outbreaks where people should be quarantined, but much of the state has very few cases, no new cases and with some travel restrictions, should be re-opened.That said, most of Clark County shouldn't be opening casinos and bars for some time, and long distance travel isn't a good idea."
"@Hyper, You nailed it! Why would be pact with other States? I guess Tonopah can open up the same day as San Francisco."
"I did see that part Big. Things can be done for much cheaper. You eliminate services, reduce things here and there. Maybe it means certain taxes are higher. I'd wager they wouldn't be once you take away the massive pension obligations and cronyism that is endemic to NYC and other major cities."
"Hyper....agreed, in Florida for example....the needs of the TriCounty area of Palm Beach/Broward/Dade are going to vastly different than rural counties in the northern part of the state. I would suspect here in Palm Beach county will be one of the last areas of Florida to return to a more normal operating state."
">>I guess Tonopah can open up the same day as San Francisco.<<<what happens if where I live, San Diego opens up fully, but Las Vegas doesn't? We have about 1/2 the Covid deaths in SD County as Clark County has (to date) despite Clark County having about 1 million less residents. Las Vegas residents will come to SD to get their haircut, enjoy our perfect weather and beaches, etc.Im comparing two bigger cities, but what if Tonopah opens before LV and LV residents want to go there to a brothel or get a haircut, Im not sure that small town wants that either.I dont think it will be a one shoe fits all opening, even here some cities in SD County are doing things different than others. The NE states and midwest states have also formed similar alliances but nowhere have I seen that it dictates eveything opening the same way."
"PnS, weren't you considering Alexandria, VA? Are you concerned about it being a bit too similar to what you are leaving?"
"Good Beer, I forgot the opportunity you point out. Please let me know when the hair salons open up in SD, so I can travel there to get a haircut! It seems a bit far to drive, but it is about time for me to get a trim and I can't take care of it locally! I'll enjoy a ""dine-in"" restaurant dinner in the same trip."
"Goodbeer, I disagree. Things around the United States will open at different times. I i guess people could travel to open areas. The same type of selfish people that hang put at beaches right now or spend the day browsing Walmart.You know darn well Tonopah will not get slammed for haircuts, etc. If things need to open at the same time (as you apparently think) the Governors should all defer to the President for a universal opening."
"Lin-DuhThe difference is Virginia as a whole is much much different than CA. There is still hope for it. It is also closer to my wife's family. Plus it isn't a permanent move, just a stepping stone. Considering the lockdown in VA which is until June, the Governors many racial scandals, and the new gun laws, I don't think he is getting re-elected anyway. We are considering other areas as well, North Carolina, Tenn., etc.. Have to just for sanity purposes at this point. Or, maybe I'll win the lotto and can just retire. Fingers crossed."
"I have been joking to my husband that I might have to take a trip to Georgia for a salon day.If South Carolina opens their salons before NC does, then I *will* go."

They backtracked on that one, but he clearly isn't planning on opening the state anytime soon.I used to go to Chesapeake all the time to meet with a client there. It's a nice place.

Even if a more reasonable Republican was in control, that wouldn't happen.California, especially Northern California, is doing what needs to be done. And they stand up to the Administration when needed. It makes perfect sense for Nevada to be part of the Western states group. Most groups have members or countries with different POV and agendas. But they can still learn from each other.BTW: The SF Bay Area counties today announced that the Shelter in Place and Stay at Home restrictions are being extended to May 31st."
"@KT, it would make sense if 3 of our 5 bordering states were included in the pact. The current pact is simply 5 Blue States that are holding hands to share the blame. It sounds like California is smarter than Nevada to some degree. No wonder our Governor is looking for a shared blame partner."
">>It sounds like California is smarter than Nevada to some degree<<Nevada while huge geographically has a population of only 3 million people, (San Diego county has more residents than the entire state of NV) . Nevada probably should be treated as three differnt areas when opneings happen, The Reno metro area, the LV metro area and the rest of the state which is extremely rural. CA will be treated differently as well. We like NY have a Gov that has been fantastic through all of this."
"@Goodbeer, I wish you were in charge. That is exactly how it should go."

"I think Utah, Arizona, Idaho, and Wyoming should make a pact and call it the Western States Pact. That will really trick some folks. It would also be just as political."
"OK so we know why the 5 blue states joined. Why didn't the other 3 join? Wouldn't you think it might be advantageous knowing what the other states are doing , and possibly even having a voice?My problem is that I am old enough to remember when we had real politicians. Some who were strong enough to have their own voice, rather than that provided by the party. And experienced enough in the art of compromise to actually get things done.And it wasn't just Democrats or Republicans, liberal or conservatives. Both sides had some great men along from time to time. And they helped shape this Country."
"@KT, I can not answer to paragraph one. I do find it terrible that neighboring States can not work together through Covid issues and find common grounds. The citizens are the real victims.I fully concur with your next two paragraphs. At least we agree on a few points and I am fine with having differences on the others. Stay safe!"
"I am not surprised.Just within my wife’s healthcare corporation, CA and NV are grouped, AZ is currently a stand-alone, and then several divisions to the East.Hunt"
"I'm with Ktinca. In the past, politicians seemed to actually use their brains. Of course, there was political bias, but politicians would actually compromise to get things done.Nowadays, our country is split between two parties. Every politician toes the line of their respective party. When you listen to them talk, they all sound like parrots of one another, even using the same verbiage. They seldom dare to use their own brains or words, or they might become ostracized like Mitt Romney or Vernon Jones. All this means is that our country is becoming more divided and that nothing ever gets done."
"Well, Nancy Pelosi refutes to share her “designer ice cream” with Steny Hoyer, or Chuck Schumer.She quipped, “Let them get their own,” or something similar.Shows that this issue is not bi-partisan.Hunt"
The 5 states have agreed to the basic structure of what reopening will require. Utah doesn't even have a statewide SIP order. Idaho's has expired and their priority is reopening churches first. If it was 2022 AZ would be the 6th member. Almost there.
"""I can hope Arizona would join more progressive west coast states,""What is the least bit progressive about the west coast states ? ""Progressive"" ….what a joke !"
Politics and other matters aside. If we had proper testing similar to S Korea or Germany there would be no need for most of the back and forth on when to open or not. Testing testing testing. Huge failure.
"Science is now showing that with the significantly higher number of people that have antibodies than were originally projected, the death rate for C-19 is between 0.02% and 0.1%, at least in Santa Clara where Stanford did their study. So basically the flu. Speaking of the seasonal flu, deaths thus far per the CDC stand around 20,000. That is 60,000 less than the prior year. Remember when the media and Dr. Faustus kept saying 2 weeks to flatten the curve? It was designed to allow hospitals and the government time to prep for a massive influx of patients and to stretch the infections out over a longer timeframe. Well we are way passed two weeks. Now it is effectively stay home until vaccine. The only place getting hit hard is Southern New York/New Jersey. That makes sense as dense urban areas with people taking almost exclusively public transit are perfect disease vectors. We've been lied to period."
No one ever said stay at home until vaccine. A bit dramatic to say the least.

@HardTenhttps:/…index.html
"NYC right now has about a 25% antibody rate. So at least 25% of the population has already gotten C-19. So if we multiply the current death rate times 4, out of a total population of 8,000,000 that leaves us with a death rate percentage of around 0.83%. While eight times larger than the common flu, clinically 0.1 to 0.83 isn't huge. We are also looking at the absolute worst case scenario in the US. Most places will be far, far lower and therefore shouldn't have to endure restrictions anywhere approaching what NYC does."
Pns.. Yes. Read your link. It was a scenario dealing with many factors. Social distancing and common sense does not equate to stay at home. And it is also good news if death rate is the same as flu but the jury is still out on that one. Time will tell.

"PnS #65, that kind of extrapolation won't necessarily give a true death rate (i.e., the death rate that would have occurred had the current mitigation measures not been imposed), because by and large hospitals have not (quite) been overwhelmed (thanks to those mitigation measures), and therefore more of the seriously infected have been able to receive hospital treatment and have recovered than would otherwise have been the case."

Also I remember a few people with terrible coughs. I was admitted and had to wait until the next morning to get a room and my room was in the pediatric ward. We asked the nurse what was going on add she said the hospital was close to capacity with a lot of people who had the “flu” and pneumonia.

You have had more direct/ first hand experiences re: the effects of this bug vs someone such as myself ( in NM), where conditions are much different in terms of population density and disease incidence vs your situation. Your take from the outset is going to be different from mine..because of what you've seen / been around. Just curious regarding what your plan might be..."
"@chuck, no that was not my issue, unfortunately it was colon cancer, a total shock because I had none of the symptoms. I was in the pediatric area for 4 days before I was moved to the adult floors. But I have a few friends who had it, they made it through but they said it was horrible.Edited: 6:01 pm, April 29, 2020 "

"""Your take from the outset is going to be different from mine..because of what you've seen / been around. Just curious regarding what your plan might be...""Yes my take I think would be very different than yours. I have already had 2 former coworkers die from this. I do live in Queens NY. I have never said that we shouldn't open up. We should and in my opinion should be done in phases as they are proposing now. What still pisses me off are people who still want to compare this to the flu. Not even close. Good luck and stay healthy and safe."
