"Belize Registers First Coronavirus Case: San Pedro Town Resident tests positive for COVID-19Monday, March 23rd, 2020At a press conference on Monday, March 23rd, Prime Minister Right Honourable Dean Barrow announced that a Belizean has tested positive for COVID-19 (Coronavirus). According to the prime minister, the person is from San Pedro Town and frequently travels to the United States of America. The person in question reportedly returned to Belize on Thursday, March 19th and went into isolation a day after arriving in the country.The positive patient is a 38-year-old female and according to Barrow, she seems to be experiencing the mild version of the disease and has not required hospitalization. According to his statement, she is recovering and appears that she had very minimal contact with others. The only person that reportedly came in close contact with her, was the physician that attended the patient, who was properly protected. “We are hoping that the incidents of transmission will pretty much be non-existent. Of course we cannot absolute be sure and that is why the tracing and mapping exercise is so important,” Barrow said. The prime minister asked Belizeans to take this issue seriously, but not to overreact or panic. He added that he will consult with health officials in order to decide if further measures would be taken to mitigate COVID-19. Some of those measures could be a quarantine needed for the island. In the case it is implemented, it is expected to be for 48 hours only.The Director of Health Services, Dr. Marvin Manzanero joined the prime minister and said that they are conducting an investigation to trace her movements from when she arrived in Belize and with who all she made contact with. He said that all the persons that were in the flight with her could be reached out for screening as an attempt to avoid a potential outbreak. Manzanero stated that they have ordered additional testing kits as they could possibly be faced with the need to rapidly increase testing.In the meantime, islanders are asked not to travel to the mainland unless it is essential. At the same time, Belizeans are asked not to travel to San Pedro. Prime Minister Barrow also indicated that a group of doctors from Cuba are heading to the country to help Belizean health officials in their mitigation efforts. Also, the National Oversight Committee, headed by Barrow and the Leader of the Opposition Honourable John Briceño, will be meeting to discuss the next step forward. One of the topics to be discussed is an economic plan to help businesses and employees who have been laid off.Source: https:/…"

"A Second Confirmed Case of COVID-19; Woman Infected Her MotherMar 25, 2020Source: https:/…200501Tonight there is a second case of the highly contagious corona virus. The second case is the mother of the thirty-eight year old resident of the San Pedrito area of San Pedro. The announcement was made today that within three days of the first case, there is now another person carrying the virus. The first carrier, who is the San Pedro woman arrived at the P.G.I.A. in Belize last Thursday from Los Angeles, California and took a Maya Island Air flight to the island along with twelve other persons. The individual was told to self isolate, but apparently that did not happen. The silver-lining is that family members and others, who she came in contact with, have been tested and the results are negative. The PM spoke about the new case in San Perdo, which remains under lockdown.Prime Minister Dean Barrow: “The first confirmed case infected one of her family members, indeed her mother. There were other family members that were screened and sampled and tested—they all were negative. And there were five additional persons in San Pedro tested—not related to the first case at all, but who it appeared might have been exhibiting symptoms that warranted their being tested—all negative. So the second case is what was to have been feared in circumstances such as has occurred. The mapping exercise in San Pedro has proceeded. We can’t say that it is done. The health professionals will have to see if there is additional mapping required in consequence of the mother of the first infected person now having tested positive. The batch of tests done by the Ministry of Health included twelve from San Pedro, but also included four other tests from persons coming from different parts of the country. I don’t want to say exactly from which communities, which districts those persons were sampled and tested, but I can say that not one of the persons tested—apart from those in San Pedro, where as I said there was the one case of the mother testing positive—nobody else from elsewhere in the country has tested positive.”"

"PRESS RELEASEMinistry of Health Confirms Fifth Case of COVID-19 in BelizeBelmopan. April 5, 2020. 10:05 a.m.Today, at 03:19 a.m., the expanded testing protocol of the Ministry of Health identified a fifth case of COVID-19. The patient is a Belizean student who returned from Florida. The patient arrived in Belize on Friday, April 3rd, and is in self-isolation at a quarantine facility. He is without symptoms and stable.In reference to patient #4, the mapping exercise of the Ministry of Health has allowed for the identification of close contacts of that patient in both San Ignacio and Belize City where swabs were taken on April 3rd and 4th.A total of 102 samples were processed on April 4th and into the early hours of today. The samples processed included close contacts from both Belize City and San Ignacio and that of health care workers in the Cayo District who had been in contact with patient #4. In addition, with the heightened surveillance, swabbing was expanded to those in quarantine in Corozal, where patient #5 was identified.The remaining 101 samples were all negative for COVID-19, and therefore, the Ministry is still unable to determine who the infected contact was for patient #4.The Ministry of Health’s surveillance efforts are ongoing and remain in a heightened mode. For this reason, the Ministry emphasizes more than ever the importance of the Belizean community’s compliance with social distancing protocols and staying at home unless it is absolutely necessary to leave the house. Ensure at all times proper hand hygiene and to follow the information as it becomes available.Ends"
