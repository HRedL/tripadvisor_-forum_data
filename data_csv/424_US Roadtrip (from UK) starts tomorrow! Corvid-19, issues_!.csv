"Hi allWe're starting our roadtrip AZ,NM, TX tomorrow, with thanks to various posters on these forums for really good advice and tips! This place is great! Obviously, we're a bit edgy about the Corvid-19 / Coronavirus situation, less about getting it as we're in our 40s, and haven't been to any at risk places, but more about if our travel will be affected (it hasn't YET). Clearly if our outward flight LGW-LAX was cancelled that would be it & we'd deal with that. Clearly like everyone there's a concern about catching it, but while in the US we'll be mostly in more remote places. There's no current restriction on travel within the US are there? Or likely to be? Do any US residents have any feel for this? Clearly it's a roadtrip so we'll be getting an internal flight from LAX to PHX, AZ from where we'll be driving through AZ, NM and TX, flying back from Austin on 31st Mar. Fingers crossed that internal flight will be OK. I figure we're most likely to be affected by bans on travel (e.g. no flights out of US) or knock-on effects of other restrictions (i.e. if our airline cancels due to lack of passengers etc.) . Part of me thinks once we've arrived we'll be fine, perhaps the worst that will happen is that we might have a delayed return to the UK. We did once before find ourselves in NY when Irene was on here way, with our flight still apparently going ahead only 24 hours before, while NY was shutting down - a state of emergency! As we know, NY escaped the sort of damage that was sadly done further down the coast, and we were re-routed home a few days later. (It might have been better if they had cancelled sooner, as we'd have had more time to stock up & prepare!)."
Clearly I mean Covid-19!
"No, no internal travel restrictions in the US thus far. I amIn a similar boat, due to fly out next week.I assume you have not been to the Schengen zone in the last two weeks?I doubt the Stable Genius will want any widespread internal travel restrictions unless absolutely forced too, too much to lose politically and egotistically........... but things can develop rapidly?Edited: 8:26 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Donald Trump, President of the United States, spoke last night and so far the UK is not part of the travel ban that begins Friday. Subject to change based on developments with the virus."
"Hi Thbergs.Think the OP knows that, hence the question about any potential escalation which of course no one here can answer with any certainty.The official version is here:https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homelandâ€¦Best place for updates etc as far as TA is concerned is the Air Travel Forum. Lots of details still to be clarified.Edited: 10:03 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Across the USA there is a poanic. Ive seen on facebook multiple examples of people going into stores and hoarding all the cleaning supplies like lusol wipes, toilet papar, and other things they feel they may need during a crisis.many places have cancelled things like concerts and sporting events or things where you may have a group of people gathering.understand people are going keep distances with no handshaking. some places could have problems due to a local outbreak like a restaurant is closed or a jotel with small staff could be closed with a local outbreak."
"Valiantsontour - no Schengen travel in last 2 weeks, much longer in fact! Yes, it's do do with escalation I guess, but also partly to do with (1) what's it like on the ground and also (b) anyone else in a similar boat!"
"We are seeing more and more places/events being cancelled/closed - those with ""large"" (undefined) gatherings of people - like the NBA cancelling the rest of their season. It's possible things like shuttle buses in national parks could be affected.For visitors entering the US, I'd make sure you have your health insurance covered (US health costs are ridiculously expensive compared to countries with national healthcare)."
"Well, at the moment we are going if the choice remains ours?Who knows what will be the position will be by next Tuesday?"
"I don't think anyone here in the U.S. can tell you what will happen in the future. The situation is evolving too rapidly. Right now, other than cancelled St. Patrick's Day events and sporting events, and colleges and universities shifting to instruction online, things seem to be pretty normal.  Here in Chicago I am noticing less automobile traffic, fewer people out and about on the streets and in restaurants, stores, and on public transit. If the virus spreads widely, in a week or 2 will the U.S. enact rules like those now in place in Italy? Will museums, national parks, restaurants, cafes, stores close? I think it's possible if Infections continue to rapidly spread.What about the supply chain? If the virus rapidly expands, will there be spot food or gas shortages? (You already can't find hand sanitizer on store shelves). What about medical care? Will the hospitals and doctors be overwhelmed? Will they get sick themselves and be unable to treat patients?Visitors from abroad should think about what they would do if they do get ill while here where the healthcare system is different and very expensive w/o insurance. What if transatlantic flights are cancelled or drastically curtailed?. What if they are required to quarantine themselves either on arrival here or upon return home (not the case now but in a week or 2? Who knows?).And one additional thought: you might be less likely to contract the virus out in the wide open spaces. But if you are ill, those same places have far less medical care and it's a lot less sophisticated than in the larger metro areas.Edited: 10:30 am, March 12, 2020 "
"From what I have seen, some people are panicked, some are concerned and taking steps to protect themselves, and many others don't believe it is an issue.We drove from Alabama to northern Minnesota last week, and the only visible signs of concern were empty shelves where the hand sanitizer should have been in a Wal-Mart in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa where we stopped for gas. Fast forward to last night when my son went to Wal-Mart to find the long aisle of toilet paper completely empty. Our local universities are going to on-line classes immediately, and our nephew who was to compete in the state geography bee found out that the big state competitions nationwide have all been cancelled and the qualifiers will compete by taking an online test in their school, instead.I was talking to my sister-in-law last night and she was a bit concerned about her flight to Tampa this weekend, but was still planning on going. I know another family that is also flying out to Tampa on Saturday. We have lots of friends that are currently still south for the winter and will be flying or driving home within the next month, hopefully. Our daughter has reservations near Tampa at the end of April. They plan to still go (drive if needed instead of flying), but that could change if more restrictions are put in place. She is a teacher that is always exposed to a lot of germs. She is concerned, but determined to make it happen. Her brother, on the other hand, is preparing to work at home for as long as needed and has decided not to make plans to attend a couple work conferences in Chicago that he expects to be cancelled anyway. Our other son and family are stocking up for what they need to get by for two weeks in a nearby state. I have a list going and plan to go shopping one more time to be prepared for a quarantine. If you want to have wipes, hand sanitizers, etc. bring then with you, because you might not find them easily in the US."
"I would not get on an airplane right now. If the situation were reversed and I had a flight to the UK, I would cancel."
"No, things are anything but normal. The NBA suspended (not canceled, yet) the season. Many sports event are played without fans (just like in Italy). We don't get together with our friends for now.It's not just about the chance of you getting ill, it's about being a responsible global citizen.My advice is, please don't travel."
"You can look up the news for your destinations. I would not travel through an airport right now. They are shutting down all major events. Pretty much all sporting events are canceled including the NBA and the NCAA basketball tournament. Disneyland in California is closing. Broadway in NYC is closing. Most universities are closing and many local school are closing too. To me it's not worth the risk. I don't know what your travel plans entail, but it's a very dicey time to travel."
"As of this moment, the UK is excluded from the President's travel ban - so, if you're willing to risk it, come on down.Before you get on the plane, you need to read the website of the Center for Disease Control, the U.S.'s main medical research and information facility. The two items you need to read is the ""symptoms"" page (fever, cough, SOB) and the map of case density(this will tell you if you're walking into a high density area). Gestation is 2 to 14 days after contact, contact generally in the form of aspirated fluid from nose or mouth inside 6 feet of the infected subject. You might want to fly into an airport in a less dense area.True, medical insurance should be a given.Since the Governor of Ohio just shut all schools and mandated no assemblies of greater than 100 people may be held, plus all major sports have closed up - my opinion would be stay home...taking any loss' on tickets. The only way to not get infected is to have no contact with another human - since this is not reasonable, as few as possible is the only option.Stay well!!"
"""Most universities are closing and many local school are closing too.""In NYS, colleges are not closed - students are working from home. To my knowledge, employees still have to report. And also to my knowledge, no schools (at least public ones) have closed (even in NYC) perhaps with the exception of the New Rochelle area where there was cluster of initial cases. That isn't to say that the situation could change.NHL also suspended its season.Edited: 6:24 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"""The biggest hotbed for coronavirus in Texas is in the Houston area, where 18 people have been diagnosed.""https:/â€¦"
"I hope you have decided to cancel this trip. Things are changing almost by the minute, While Utah currently only has 5 Coronavirus cases, the Governor has asked that there be no public gatherings of more than 100 people. University classes will all be online. Church services are cancelled. Major events and gatherings have been cancelled. He also suggested that people in the vulnerable age group (over 60), avoid groups larger than 20 people. This are precautionary measures."
Wonder if the OP flew or not?Looks like the US may well add the UK to the ban list based on what OSG said yesterday?If so getting home might be fun but Iâ€™m sure they are watching the news.Iâ€™m still waiting to see if that happens or BA pull the flights for operational reasons.
The UK ban won't start until Monday. There is no ban for UK citizens leaving the US. So they won't be arrested at the border and thrown into virus jail.
But there will likely be a mad scramble to get seats on flights home from the U.S. before the airlines stop flying to the U.K and Ireland

"â€˜But there will likely be a mad scramble to get seats on flights home from the U.S. before the airlines stop flying to the U.K and Irelandâ€™Exactly what I meant about fun getting home, all the airlines (not just UK or EU based ones), will be/are cutting capacity in both directions, and a limited number of US airports are being used for flights from Europe which do still fly.OP is likely to get home one way or another but may have a extended stay (unless they cut the trip very short) and reroute as Austin is not on the list ( but DFW is). It all depends who is still flying and from and to where. Maybe more so as I guess they are flying with Norwegian from that itinerary?Anyway, we are definitely not going.................refund awaited.........next trip in May........maybe?"
Hi RT.I doubt very much the OP would need to rely on keeping tabs on TA for that news!
"Hi all, OP here - thanks for the various bits of advice! We had a hotel booked the night before near our departure airport (London Gatwick) as we live up North. We woke the morning of the flight & made the tough (at the time) call to cancel the trip. We'd booked motels / car hire via booking.com and 90% was free cancellation. Norwegian Airlines had loosened their re-booking fee policy loads so we re-booked our outward flight for August. We waited on our return flight (Austin-Gatwick) and that was cancelled yesterday. So we're gutted we didn't get to go as we were really looking forward to the trip, but, even on that Friday it was looking that on the balance of probability the trip would be poor due to closed and restricted places on the route. Getting stranded & struggling to get back is one thing, but finding out on day 3 of a 19 day trip that there's no flight home would be no fun. Not least as the trip was 2400miles long or so. All this before you even consider any risks around the illness itself, with the likelihood greater that we'd spread it. Timing-wise it's poor as we've lost money, the day before we travelled flights from EU to US were stopped, 4 days after flights from the UK to US were stopped. As it's panned out and things have developed and escalated severely we're just thankful that we did make the call & hope everyone is coping OK. Let's hope we all stay healthy & that we all get to travel again, soon.Edited: 10:13 am, March 23, 2020 "
Thanks for the update.Several US states and a number of cities under stay at home orders. We are under state of emergency and a public health emergency. Hopefully everyone is safe and can plan this trip for next year!
Thanks for the update. It would've been an awful trip even if you made it. Too bad about the financial hit. But at the end it's all for the best.
"Thanks for reporting back.You my be a bit out of pocket, but had you flown, it could have been for more money, and the prospect of being stranjded, too awfyl to contemplate.Things are changing so fast, the only possible advice right now to all is don't go, or return now if you got somewhere abroad.Stay home, stay well. I'd keep monitoring Norwegian for that August flight. I'd not pin any hopes on that, it may be too soon.SWT"
"I leave on the 28 May from San Antonio by road for Phoenix. I am planning two days. I am finally able to go home (to Phoenix AZ). I have been in San Antonio since January 2020 on a work related issue. I have an overnight in Las Cruces NM. This will be all by road along the I-10. The only other person with me is my wife (Duong). I have read what the various health warnings are for COVID 19 in TX, NM, and AZ. I hope that neither of use get it. Is there anything that others know about, that I should be aware of right now in March 2020?"

"SusieLou,Do you have a link for that?"
I thought I had a link to the info about the travel quarantine but I can't locate that so I'm going to delete my post. NM governor did implement a statewide shelter in place that begins tomorrow. https:/â€¦31902347
"@Rahul Iyerstart your own threadright now its uncertain how things will be by that time. The big issue will be hotel availability for the night.between now and then gas stations will still be open, supermarkets open. even if restaurants were closed you could go into a store and get premade food items ready to eat like sandwiches or buy stuff to make a sandwich"
