"Hong Kong is currently working towards normalisation of the situation, with things slowly slowly reopening.Of importance for visitors continuing to a second destination in Asia: many countries have restrictions on travellers from Hong Kong. This includes at least Taiwan, Philippines and Thailand. The many flight cancellations to/from Hong Kong should be another concern. I'm not aware of a central, reliable repository of information on this, it changes all the time at the whim of the various governments involved.For updates & more questions about the situation in Hong Kong best use the other sticky: https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/ShowTopic-g294… That sticky started due to the protest situation, then morphed into a virus-related thread, and with the protests picking up again likely soon back to the protest situation.Edited: 7:09 pm, March 09, 2020 "
Another related thread regarding Immigration experience when arriving into Hong Kong during the Coronavirus Outbreak. There are some recent posts there that will be worth reading for anyone is planning to arrive here in HK in the near future https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29421…
"Hotel Situation in HK during the CoronaVirus OutbreakAt present, hotel room rates around the city remain at deeply discounted levels. I'm finding properties in the 2-4 star range offering prices, even on weekends that are 25-33% their normal rates of the past few years. Some 5 star properties are offering discounts as well but not at the same level of concessions that you will find with the midrange category places. As such, it is not necessary to reserve hotel rooms far in advance this year. You can wait until much closer to your intended dates of travel, to ensure your trip isn't cancelled. Then book with 1 week or so of your intended travel to Hong Kong.This situation may change later in the year but many of us feel that it is not likely as we have a major protest movement that is presently set on pause while the city deals with the Coronavirus Outbreak. After the virus outbreak settles, if the protests return to the same levels of activity that we saw last autumn, visitors will likely continue to remain away from HK in mass numbers. If this happens, hotel room rates will probably stay quite low as well.Edited: 7:40 pm, March 09, 2020 "

"Post #14. Related, Macau has just revised their entry restrictions yet again and are now barring everyone from 18 March from entry (no more quarantine) if you are not from Macau or legal resident of China, HK or Taiwan. HK and Macau have have fairly similar entry restrictions plans in recent weeks. This could very well mean that we see a similar travel ban come into effect here in Hong Kong in the very near future."
"Post #12 Update - on updated museum reopenings I visited the Heritage Museum yesterday and HKMOA this afternoon. The procedures are simple. They have three 2 hour slots with 30 minute closings in between in order to clean and disinfect. Small number of visitors are allowed to enter, not sure the exact count but there were very few during my visits. There are announcements starting 10 minutes before the end of the session, informing you to begin exiting the museum. You'll find hand gel tubs in quite a few of the galleries as well. All rather straight-forward, very few others in the museums and everyone is quite spread out, making it potentially a safer place to be than out on the streets or in the malls. A last word - The HKMOA renovations are really nice and the Turner to Hockley exhibition of British landscapes from London's Tate is a great way to kick off the reopening of the museum."
"Thanks for the report! I'm so eager to see the re-opened HKMOA.Meanwhile, back in the US we are working from home, closing schools, online teaching, washing hands, social distancing, closing restaurants and businesses. No whining from me - I know what Hong Kongers have lived through and hope our citizens will also sacrifice to stop this outbreak. I'm happy to hear that HK is on a better footing than a month ago - hoping we find the same on the other side of this. Amazing - and to think that my first knowledge months ago of the outbreak in Wuhan was from a poster on TA."
"I haven't seen much in the way of social distancing in HK (pretty hard considering how many people there are in this small area), no restaurants are closed (well, those targeting tourists may have gone bankrupt), and most non-tourist businesses go on as usual.Worst by far is the schools being closed for two full months now, and at the very least another month to go and probably even longer, easily another month before it's all reopened. No idea what's going to happen to all those cross border students, and the year end (or even school end!) exams... Also schools are bound to require their students to wear masks, but no-one knows where to get that extra million or so of masks needed daily for that to happen."
"There is overall social distancing as evident by the lesser number of people walking around, using public transport and eating out. A lot of restaurants have gone out of business or are operating with more limited hours. Many people I know still work from home. Even my office is letting staff out an hour early to avoid the worst of the traffic (=crowds).There have been no hard rules to close any business though. The only closures were facilities controlled by the government. Many of them are starting to open again though some with just limited service.I have a friend with two children (8 and 10) who has only gone out just once to dine since the virus hit. On most days, she stays home while her husband goes to work and does all the shopping. I also know people who have been working from home since CNY. Some elderly folks I know have scrapped their weekly mahjong meetings. This past weekend though, it was noticeable that more people were out and about. A restaurant that I walk past often was at 70-80% capacity, vs maybe just 30% two weeks ago.We visited the HKMOA several months ago before the virus hit. It's indeed a nice place. The architecture is very interesting. Even though I don't know much about Chinese art, the exhibits are very well done. They have a small section on Western art as well though obviously, European museums and the NY Metropolitan offer more famous works."
"Public transport: sure, with the schools closed that's less people. The lack of tourists is also telling in transport. Transport has been getting notably more crowded over the past two weeks, East Rail Line is much less crowded than normal, in a large part thanks to the lack of cross border traffic.Walking around: not any less crowded than normal in Tai Po (an area that normally sees little to no tourists). Last Saturday the malls were as crowded as ever. Restaurants had their usual lines; I have yet to see a restaurant that closed or that's significantly less crowded. I did notice two dispensaries that closed down (permanently), and at least one Chow Tai Fook closed (temporarily - shop is still there, just closed for business).I've also not seen any closed shops in Ap Lei Chau where I currently work; another corner of Hong Kong that rarely sees tourists normally. As I started there early Feb I can't tell whether the current crowds (which to me feel normal for such areas) are less than normal.So it seems the locals don't go out much less than usual; but if you live in a tourist-heavy area no doubt you will see relatively quiet streets and struggling restaurants. I haven't visited Lan Kwai Fong or Soho recently, especially the latter area I've heard starts to resemble a ghost town with most units boarded up."
"New Monitoring Bracelet information from RTHKPeople coming into Hong Kong from overseas (not inc. Macau, Mainland China or Taiwan) from Thursday will all be issued a new type of monitoring bracelet that officials say can raise the alarm and alert the authorities if they leave their quarantine location before the mandatory two-week period is up...... https:/…1515386-20200318.htm"
"Update on the second wave (as it is being referred to) of Covid Outbreak locally. Covid-19 have started to spike (+25) yesterday taking our total to 192 (see links) Similarly Macau, after having no new cases for 40 days, has been been dealt 7 new imported cases this week. https:/…1515286-20200318.htmhttps://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-e…"
"I just wanted to update in here about the time it takes to get out of the airport as in the past few days, there were lots of reports and stories that were quite frustrating and many visitors were concerned what to expect upon their arrival in the next few days.The airport immigration was overwhelmed with many returning to HK , especially students from overseas in the past couple of days. Reporting that it took 4-5 hours to get out of the HK airport to get the health declaration, immigration, the wrist bands, and questions asked...etc. As of today, it seemed the process is much faster. It was about 15 minutes to 30 minutes. However, there seems to be a long delay in getting the tracker wristband to activate because one needs to wait for the text message to your phone to activate, Some says it's up to 12 hours delay. But no matter, the 14 day quarantine rule applies to all visitors from any country coming into HK now, except Taiwan and Macau. Very amazed by HK government implementing such measures.Edited: 3:40 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"If they manage to get the wristband and app system to work, then HK is ahead of just about every country worldwide. Sure, there could be loopholes that some folks would like to pick on. However, we aren't seeing any other country offering a better solution at this point.In fact, I know somebody who was going to head to New Zealand (dual citizen HK/NZ so allowed entry there) at the end of this month originally. She was going to ignore NZ's 14-day self-isolation ban since she said it would be impossible to police. She was forced to cancel her trip only when HK implemented the 14-day quarantine procedure."
"Yes, it sad to see people ignore the self quarantine order but that is a reality. Almost all western countries weren't prepared for the outbreak and now they (including my own) all had learned the ""speed"" of the virus and resort to asking citizen to practice social distancing, personal hygiene and WFH. Good for HK to use GPS tracking devices for people under quarantine order. We have similar devices but they are mostly for DUI offenders and other convicts. There is whole rack of privacy issue to use it on travelers here.Edited: 12:24 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Just an update: it was reported that 41 people violated the self-quarantine procedure. They were caught by the new wristband/app tracker system. Charges could be filed against these folks.In today's social media world, a couple of the offenders even posted how they slipped off the wristband and went out. Social media has created a lot of idiots.Edited: 11:37 pm, March 22, 2020 "

"Travel Ban UpdateCE Carrie Lam announced this afternoon that starting Wednesday, non-residents would banned from entry into Hong Kong for the next 14 days (see link). This ruling excludes non-residents arriving from the mainland, Macau or Taiwan who will still be allowed in, as long as they hadn't been anywhere else in the world in the past 14 days. However, those coming from Macau and Taiwan will also have to go into quarantine for 14 days. Further exclusion - Macau residents who have been in other countries over the past 14 days will still be allowed to fly into Hong Kong airport, but will be taken straight to their home city by coach.https:/…1516270-20200323.htmSouth China Morning Post adds that effect Wednesday, there will be ban the sale of alcohol at more than 8,000 bars and restaurants to contain the spread of the coronavirus (see link) https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics…"
"The alcohol ban is to be self-policed for now by the establishments. I am sure there will be places that find ways to get around it or just blatantly ignore it. Some sort of legislation might be necessary.Yesterday, at least several people were caught on video/photos walking around while wearing the quarantine wristbands. A couple even begged others to give them a chance when they were dining out. The government is ""considering"" charges. This baffles me at times. The government should just come out and prosecute all violators aggressively instead of giving them any chances. Also, why is it so hard to set up a hotline to report violators? It should be a one day thing, not a multiple day exercise."
"There is no timeline for an actual alcohol ban as it requires a change of the law, as basically the liquor licenses have to be suspended.Considering the government has proven unable (or unwilling?) to close places where large groups of people spend extended time in close proximity such as cinemas, I doubt they can really stop the sale of alcohol in bars/restaurants. Limiting opening hours will be pretty tough already, and I'm not sure if Carrie Lam is willing to risk using the emergency laws again."
"If they write the legislation, then it becomes illegal. However, our government has proved to be non-assertive when it comes to enforcing any of these measures. Just keep in mind that ignoring any government advice or laws aren't limited to HK only. You see plenty of that worldwide--Italy, UK, US. It's human nature so not a specific problem that only the HK government faces."
">>> (it is still apparently illegal to wear a mask, for example)I remember that one had been struck down by the courts?? Government did launch an appeal... so it's not all set and done."
"The emergency mask measure has indeed be struck down by the courts. They can no longer arrest or charge someone just for wearing a mask.>>>(it is still apparently illegal to wear a mask, for example)"

"Indeed.So the bars in Lan Kwai Fong (largest recent cluster) and weddings (resulted in another major cluster in Discovery Bay) are off the hook... but our domestic helpers are affected badly, almost as if they're being targeted (even more so as the rule is effective starting Sunday)."

"You can always find rule breakers and rule abiders. Walking in Central yesterday, there were far far fewer domestic helpers hanging out. The ones that were there mostly followed the rules. I didn't see the really large groups. TV showed the pedestrian tunnel underneath Connaught Road Central, claiming there were lots of people. Believe me, the density is way lower than it normally is. A faction of the city loves to criticize the government regardless of what they do. If we shut down the city and tell all dining outlets to close, they will probably criticize as well. I have no problem with the criticism but let's see them come up with some proposed solutions at the same time.Also, make sure to compare HK's situation to Italy, Spain, UK and even the US.

">> Since nearly all ""bars"" are actually licensed as restaurants this will, I predict, have minimal effect,It is defined as places where alcohol is sold as main business, something like that.

Those things we will know in a few years from now... who had the best approach.
"Will be challenging to measure actual and economic costs even in the future. Take a city similar to HK in NYC. Sure, they can measure the cost in lost lives but the bombardment on their health care system - how does one put a cost figure there. And what is the cost to their local economy, I wouldn't even want to speculate what type of estimates they will come up with."
"Recently in the news a complaint that many deaths in the UK were not appropriately credited to the coronavirus, especially for people dying in a care home. Only by looking back we can get an estimate; an unusually high peak of deaths (normally in winter the number of deaths is far higher than in summer) which can be accredited to this virus, plus probably a good number of others, people who would have died that winter anyway but it just happened to be the coronavirus that was the last straw.Then the problem that measurements of the numbers of people that are infected are often way too low - today it was reported that based on recently donated blood some 3% of the Dutch now have been infected with the virus (and of course recovered, as otherwise they wouldn't be allowed to donate), that'd mean half a million infections, while there are just over 28,000 confirmed infections in the country. That suggests just 5% of the infections makes it into the statistics. There is no extensive testing for the disease, only severe cases are formally tested.Then there rae the many people that may die or lose part of their remaining life due to cancelled/delayed medical procedures, including cancer treatment. Plus the years lost due to the stress caused by having your business collapse and ending up riddled in debt, maybe losing your home in the process, etc.The economic cost will be very hard to estimate. Many businesses collapse, quite a few of whom no doubt were the weaker ones, creating openings for new businesses to pop up (a recession is not necessarily a bad thing). People out of jobs, but likely the economy can revive quickly when it's all over and jobs will return, especially the tourism related ones as people are most likely just postponing travel plans rather than cancelling forever. Too bad the HK government doesn't seem to care much about the unemployed. Even the US is doing a lot better on that front at the moment."
For the first time in 6 weeks we had zero new Covid-19 infection cases today (see news reports) https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-e…https:/…1521621-20200420.htmhttps:/…

"HGY, It is a nice milestone for the city and a good sign that things are moving in the right direction. I hope your partner arrives safe and virus-free. I've had a couple of friends make it back earlier this month, they have both recently finished quarantine and are free to join the community."
">>>But that's probably at least in part due to there being no flights from the UK arriving today<<<Virgin Atlantic VS206 arrived today and I was originally meant to be on it but couldn't travel for obvious reasons. I'd anticipated it being cancelled but instead it was retimed to depart Heathrow 7 hours earlier than its original scheduled departure time. The ticket is left open to rebook before the end of the year for travel until the end of April 2021 (that's provided of course Virgin Atlantic are still in business). I believe the few scheduled flights still operating between LHR and HK are continuing mainly as cargo flights to bring goods, particularly medical supplies, back to the UK.I'm also extremely pessimistic about the chances of getting back to HK in Nov/Dev as planned so this is likely to be the first year since 1994 when I won't have visited and I'm already missing my beloved Cheung Chau!"

"Thanks for your comments HK Ga Yau and BradJill. It won't be an option for me but I did once spend a month in the Warwick many years ago and it wouldn't be a bad place to have to do quarantine with its balcony rooms overlooking the beach and the rooms are also quite spacious by HK standards. I still have family in Sai Kung and friends in Tung Chung but on Cheung Chau I have a friend who operates one of the largest accommodation providers on the island and usually have access to an apartment there. My brother must be one of the oldest teachers left in HK and I think is struggling with the online teaching via Google Meet but can't afford to retire. Meanwhile my sister in law's been trapped in the Philippines since early January. However, life under the so-called lockdown here isn't too bad, I can walk right into the New Forest within 5 mins of leaving home. Brad, I hope you and Jill are able to continue your intrepid world exploits before too long."

"Groundbreaking stuff..... Very impressive and well ahead of the curve compared to much of the world. Will be interesting to see if after trial in May, if they decide to go forward with long-term implementation. My biggest concern is the 40 second per disinfection, doesn't sound like much without many 'working' channels, this could create quite a bottleneck and slow down the passenger processing through immigration for those who arrive at HKG."
"Indeed. At 10,000 passengers an hour you'd need over 110 such gates already just to keep up.Then there's the question of effectiveness. It won't disinfect already infected people, for example. It only disinfects the outside of the clothing, any virus that is in between or under the clothing is likely to remain unaffected.So sure, interesting, but imho not something to be rolled out without answering some serious questions and doing some very, very thorough testing.."
"I saw that on TV a couple of weeks ago. I didn't know they were testing it for the airport?I don't think it does anything though. At the end of the day, people are the carriers of the virus. You certainly can't cleanse the inside of a body unless you believe in Trump and inject disinfectant into your body."
"Sadly, Dr. Trump has since decided to take his ball and go home. The White House briefings and question sessions (also known as The Daily Trump Show) have been taken off the air, at least temporarily, since touting his idea of using disinfectants for internal body cleansing and virus treatment."

"HGY,Come on, friend. In the strictest of sense, you are correct but these are mere semantics with the article title - 'HK has no new virus cases for fifth day'. I really don't think that is something worth getting worked up over.And I understand you are concerned that there are a lot of daft folks out here. Perhaps you are right. I personally don't assume this of readers without knowing them first. Similarly, I am not concerned that the average person doesn't know how to click on links and read articles. If they are, there is probably little we can do to actually help them here anyway. Lastly, travel is basically banned to Hong Kong right now, it is not like anyone can take this information and make travel decisions at this very moment. This is simply an indicator of how things are going and how the city is progressing against CV-19. That is it, that is all.I say this jokingly but I'm wondering if you, like I find myself, are suffering from a bit of boredom with this forum now that posters have completely disappeared. Thought I heard crickets the other day when I opened up this forum page."

"HK *reported* no new cases homegrown cases for many days now. That's a fact. The key is ""reported."" There are of course possibilities of undiscovered carriers lurking. That's why the government and its panel of experts continue to recommend wearing masks and urging social distancing like many places worldwide.I seem to recall certain people refusing to wear masks at the start of the pandemic. I wonder if those folks became the hidden carriers and helped spread the disease. It's good for achieving herd immunity though. LOL."
"Maybe that's the case in expat-haven (not all Chinese are locals, especially not in such areas).Not in the rest of Hong Kong. Or on the MTR/bus. Yesterday we were not allowed to board the Ma On Shan Tsuen minibus before digging up masks (of course not wearing any while hiking). Looking around me on the MTR as I type this everyone is wearing a mask. The shopping crowds in Mongkok last Wednesday evening were also pretty much 100% mask wearing.Restaurants also still take everyone's temperature. Not that the person doing this is actually looking at what the display indicates... as long as the thing does its they're happy.Edited: 5:38 am, May 04, 2020 "

Hong Konger here.Most companies have changed their work from home policies to all back to office this week. The street is as crowded as before the whole coronavirus issue.

Especially Macau must be desperate for mainlanders - and their gambling money.
"I just had a call with Hong Kong Airport and she said I can enter Hong Hong via ground from Mainland China as a USA citizen if I have been there for at least 14 days. I then called immigration to confirm and they told me to read the website and follow the rules stated there (which I have many times). ""Health quarantine arrangements on inbound travelers from the Mainland, Macao or Taiwan, including Hong Kong and *non-Hong Kong residents*: "" Compulsory quarantine at designated places (home or other accommodation) apart from the exempted persons under the ""Compulsory Quarantine of Certain Persons Arriving at Hong Kong Regulation""""Restrictions on Entering Hong Kong The Hong Kong SAR Government restricts any Hubei residents, and non-Hong Kong residents who have visited the Hubei Province in the past 14 days upon arrival from entering Hong Kong since January 27, 2020. With effect from 0.00am on March 25, 2020 until further notice: All non-Hong Kong residents coming from overseas countries and regions *by plane* will be denied entry to Hong Kong; and Non-Hong Kong residents coming from the Mainland, Macao and Taiwan will be denied entry to Hong Kong *if they have been to any overseas countries and regions in the past 14 days.""So from this, As a non-resident, I can enter HK through Shenzhen by as I have not been to any other overseas countries and regions in the past 14 days. Then would go through the 14 day quarantine at a hotel. Is my understanding correct? I wish immigration could be clearer on this, but no one there wants to take the blame if they give the wrong information when asked. I'm a US citizen in Mainland for the past 5 months and used up my 60day visa, + the one time extension + the 30 day stay permit and the entry/exit bureau here say I need to leave by the end of my permit. But there are only 3 flights out to USA a week at a hefty cost of 4000USD. :("

"It's written in a kinda roundabout legalese, but that's exactly what I read in there. The same has been reported in the media repeatedly.Non-residents who have been in China, Macau or Taiwan for more than 14 days before arriving in HK will be allowed entry, after which they have to go through the 14 days of quarantine.Now in your case I suppose you will want to fly out immediately (or at least within 14 days upon arrival). I don't know the rules in that case. I have heard about mainlanders being allowed to transfer through HK from the airport directly to Shenzhen Bay. You will have to contact the Hong Kong immigration department directly about this, I can very well imagine that they can give you permission to bypass or break quarantine to catch a flight out."
The exemptions from quarantine for inbound travellers from the mainland are detailed in this link;https:/…599C-quarantine_exemption.htmlYou can ask the Immigration Dept for clarification but I don’t see an exemption from 14 days quarantine for inbound travellers who would otherwise wish to depart from HK sooner.Quarantine can be at a “hotel or other dwelling place”.https:/…quarantine_centre_en.pdf
"Thanks all for your replies. I called the immigration and was helped by someone to confirm that I can enter Hong Kong via Shenzhen Bay or the Zhuhai bridge. I don't have any problems with the 14 day quarantine, just need to get out of China as I have exhausted all my extension options here. Thanks again."

Authorities in the country concerned will also have to verify the institution by letter. Original test results, with name and passport number included, will also be needed as will proof of a 14-day hotel booking in Hong Kong for quarantine purposes.https:/…1538479-20200718.htm"
"Note - the requirements to obtain a laboratory COVID-19 test result have been put on HOLD, per the Philippine Airlines website. However, I have not been able to confirm this on the HK government website, which merely states that the government has allowed for the possibility that this can be put into effect. From PAL Website:Updated: July 15, 2020Effective 12:00am on 15 Jul 2020, there are additional requirement for prevention and control of the disease, like wearing of face masks on public transport and requiring passengers arriving from places with high risk of COVID-19, such as Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and South Africa, as well as foreign domestic helpers from the Philippines and Indonesia, to obtain a negative result from a COVID-19 test conducted by a recognized laboratory before arriving in Hong Kong.Update: July 16, 2020With reference to the announcement on July 15, 2020, the mandate on passengers arriving in Hong Kong from places with high risk of COVID-19 to obtain a negative result from a COVID-19 test conducted by a recognized laboratory is put ON HOLD. The negative test report requirement is NOT required for the meantime.https:/…travelrules"
Please ignore my post below. I believe that the order has now been put into effect and passengers will be required to have a negative test certificate if they travel on 25 July 2020 or later.
There are sudden burst of coronavirus cases in Hong Kong in these few weeks. Now the restrictions are tighter than ever and anyone traveling from high risk countries (more info on https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/index.html ) will need to provide proof that they do not have the virus before they can cross the borders. It is at an all time high right now. Don't come here for your own safety. We are not coping well. Stay safe everyone.

"The post by Mika Rika, is a bit ridiculous.

"FRIDAY 24 JULY 2020 HKG ARRIVAL AND COVID TESTING PROCESSFriend flew Friday 24 July from Manila to HKG on Philippine Airline. She beat by one day the new rules requiring a negative Covid test 72 hours before boarding the plane (now in place for passengers from high risk countries such as Pakistan, Iran, India, Kazakhstan, Philippines, the USA)- short flight, said 100% of passengers with masks & 85% with plastic face shields for additional protection, plane arrived an hour early @9:00 am due to less air traffic- prior to leaving Manila, she downloaded the HK electronic travel form so as to save time in HK and not have to fill-in the paper copy- cleared immigration and customs and then was bused to the adjacent Asia-World convention centre where she provided a saliva sample at 10:00 am and was put in a large room with tables and chairs (2 meters apart) to wait for test results.- Around 3:00 pm staff provided stale sandwiches. No other food options available in holding area. - 10 hours later, at 8:00 pm I showed up outside waiting for her. - 3:00 am (17 hours later) test results finally came back - negative as expected, although on her flight there were 9 women who tested positive and will be immediately hospitalized in HK. Suggestions to consider:- consider arriving after 12:00 noon so that you don’t have to wait at the airport for 10-18 hours. Instead you will be bussed with other passengers to a Kowloon hotel and provided a private room where can sleep, get modest food, and await test result.- If waiting at the airport, bring large battery bank to keep electronics charged for 12-18 hours. There are charging stations but they are crowded and not much social distancing - Transfer some food into your carry-on bag before leaving customs zone. Once you leave customs, you will be separated from you luggage until you are released from holding area with negative Covid result, then you can collect you bags and go to quarantine hotel (required if from high risk country...list changes so check website). Note, HK customs has almost no food restrictions so fresh fruit, meat, etc can all be brought from other countries. Zero duty on beer and wine. - You can sleep at your table, maybe bring a pillow. Some people brought yoga mats to sleep on the concert floor, but staff said no, it’s not clean there. After receiving negative test result she was released to pick up her luggage and went outside where I picked her up with private car and delivered her to a quarantine hotel in TST, Butterfly on Prat (14 nights @US$60/night). Other available transportation options at 3:00 am were taxis. There didn’t seem to be any enforcement of transportation options."
"With the new rule to have covid-19 test w/in 72hrs of departure to HK (from say USA), all passengers require to be tested negative for COVID-19 (with their HKID / Passport # printed on the test result, AND the HKID / Passport printed on the doctor's report). I called around for the Covid-19 test centers, they ALL said there's NO way the result will be ready w/in 72hrs (more like 6-10 business days!!! Not to mention they may not be able to include HKID / Passport number on the test result document! That's ridiculous and is there anyone here who has done such test and successfully received the test result (w/ the HKID / Passport # on the document) w/in 72hrs prior to departure?"
"72-hour requirement: If you are flying from the USA, you might find better luck posting the question in the USA Forum or Air Travel forum. People residing at your point of departure should have better knowledge about the facilities that can issue you the necessary report within the time frame.As long as the report is in English or Chinese, then it just needs to have a name that matches your travel document (passport or HKID). You should not need the passport # or HKID # on the report itself."
Information on the HKIA website indicates that the passport or HK ID number does in fact have to be included in the letter or certificate provided by the lab;https:/…

">> My gf is in HK since 3 weeks now for work and i desperately want to join her as a tourist for 3 month. Is it totally impossible to enter in HK ? (i m from france) ? Girlfriend - so not married or otherwise family. That makes it pretty much impossible indeed for you to enter Hong Kong as a tourist.I see two possible solutions. Marry her (that should allow you entry as a visitor), or find a job in HK (that should allow you entry as resident, employment visa)."
