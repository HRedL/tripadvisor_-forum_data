"Fairly standard stuff. If you are not here, you cannot come and if you are here, it's very hard to leave. this situation will not change for the foreseeable future,I can add that all restaurants are closed (although some are offering take away and home delivery) and that much of public transport is not operating. Also, not all beaches are closed (here in Albufeira they are not) but the weather is not at all beach weather.Look forward with foreboding to the new world order of things.Edited: 1:41 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"much of public transport is not operating - not in the big cities, All ""normal"" considering the low number of people on it. Long distance buses (not to all the usual destinations) and trains are running with reduced offer. Just as a note the ""The suspension of most international flights to and from Portugal and the suspension of some domestic flights."" was in March 19... but of course that there were still flights for a while to to return foreign to their homes and Portuguese nationals back home.All this is going to change after May2 when the state of emergency finish, we are ""expecting"" the new rules."
"hi everyone -Portugal's DRE posted on the 19th about extending border control, with exceptions for a few countries (USA and Brazil included), which, according to the note, seems to be applicable to non-resident foreigners (since residents can come from any country). https:/…Does anyone know if non-resident foreigners are being able to enter the country? I've contacted airlines and they say yes (to the best of their abilities), but SEF says no via email, contradicting DREs announcement.What are your thoughts? Thank you."
"Ana who manages the main airports in Portugal has the daily list of arrivals and departures, supposedly those transport only portuguese or non-portuguese but residents in Portugal or people doing business trips because that's the rule at the land borders... https:/…real-time-arrivals"
I've postponed my trip and to be honest I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon it's just not going to be an enjoyable experience anymore with all these regulations it's never going to be the same again. Tourism as we know it is over.
