Hi all in the past I have always used cash on Dalyan does any one know if this is allowed or of you have to use a card ? If it as to be card does anyone know the best ones as I have never used one ?Travel 2 Aug being asked to check on now
"Card is best, contactless ideally as less transfer of germs.I use Starling bank card, easy to use app, use in atms too.best bank rates. I always take £50 approx in lira, for arrival, tips etc.But now with the virus people prefer card ascash carries lots of germs.So card is best but they'll usually take cash too anyway."
"You still need cash for things such as sunbeds, dolmus markets etc. My friend who lives in Turkey still using cash, as are many locals."
"Thank you both just waiting to see if flight goes and the mask situation Spain are doing masks if you can't social distance at 1,5 meters"
"I think the restrictions such as masks etc are going to be around for some time to come Lisa. Just my own opinion but as much as l want to go back this year, l have decided to wait, hopefully 2021 holidays will be more like they used to be. But who knows, this could all get even worse if there’s second spikes everywhere. Nothing is certain."
"You are meant to use the Kent Kart on the dolmus. They have installed automatic kiosks now at the bus stations. Small initial cost for the card ( 7tl last year) then top up as necessary via the kiosk. Very easy to use. It’s cheaper than paying cash. I have seen some of the older Turkish residents still paying with cash. Most shops, restaurants and bars still taking cash. I agree with Caz re- Starling Card. £300 pound limit free withdrawal per day and the best rate. Some will probably recommend the Revolut card as you can load it with a currency of your choice but there is a limit on free withdrawals. I find the Starling card very user friendly. Easy to apply for online."
Thank you all I will get a card with small amount of cash if we go I am fine with masks in shops transport ect but I didnt really fancy one on the beach so we have a big descion do we go or not go !
"I am confused with this contamination thing,we are told that it is not spread by touch but by droplets from mouth or nose.I always go out wearing a mask but apart from the first few times I went out I do not wear gloves.I have never had a problem paying with cash until yesterday when I visited M&S.I paid with cash for my food,then went and had a look at clothes,when I went to pay I had the correct money ready but was told I had to pay with a card to avoid contamination,I don't have contactless....so.what,s that about.It is quite unusual to pay by card in Dalyan and I can't see that changing as the trader has to pay for the privilege of having the means."
"Cash can carry germs so lots of hand washing after handling as its been through many hands.Read this online money site:The only potential way to acquire COVID-19 from a contaminated surface is to get the virus on your hands and then touch your mouth, eyes or nose.This is why everyone from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO to local governments have stressed that hand-washing is critically important, especially after handling money.Bacteria and some viruses have been identified on currency. It’s just that COVID-19 has not been examined.Little is known about how long COVID-19 might survive on currency. Laboratory testing on influenza suggests viability lasts from one hour to one day without mucus.However, viability in nature would depend on temperature, humidity and exposure to sunlight. Nothing has yet been done with COVID-19 survival on cash, though on other surfaces, COVID-19’s survival has again variedI take a small amount of cash out as need for some businesses.I always take my starling card as its safe and can use whenever needed.Thankfully we all have options."
"It’s not unusual to pay by debit card here in Dalyan anymore. Most places now accept cards. You can order a takeaway from some restaurants and pay by debit card on delivery. Even at the market some of the bigger stalls selling shoes and clothing offer the option to pay by card.Edited: 4:37 pm, June 28, 2020 "
