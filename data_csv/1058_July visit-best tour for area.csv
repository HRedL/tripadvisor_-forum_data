"Good Morning from sunny and hot Florida. We are headed to S. Lake Tahoe (staying at Hard Rock) in mid/late July for a week. On the first day of a trip to a new city we usually like to take some kind of tour (boat, van etc) to familiarize us with the area and help us focus on the things we want to see and do for the the week (we will have a rental car.) Any thoughts on the best company to do this with?"
"Sometimes itâ€™s best to drive around the lake clockwise to get a lay of the land. Lake Tahoe is only 22 miles long and takes 2-3 hours to drive around. You will see Emerald Bay from the top. Maybe you will want to return to hike to the shore, or take a boat from the south shore. There are boats you can rent yourself and motor over for a picnic, or take a tour like Safari Rose and others. From Zephyr Cove is the MS Dixie ll Paddlewheel that runs a few times a day To Emerald Bay and back. There are other boats that take you on tours, but none I know that go all the way around the lake."
"There are many interesting things outside of South Lake Tahoe city scattered around the Lake, so you will need more than just a new SLT city tour, and there aren't any such guided tours in the small cities of LT area -AFAIK. A drive around Lake Tahoe will help some, but you will not have a tour guide to question and to point out interesting things which might be just out of sight from the main road. Myself would not want to miss anything that aligns with my particular at a new place, so I would do a search to find things along your particular lines of Interest, before any drive around. For example, myself might search for stunning views at LT, river tours, or kayak tours, or biking tours, Etc, but each person's particular interest would be different.Hope this helps, and enjoy your stay!"
