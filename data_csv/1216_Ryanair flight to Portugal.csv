"Hi, Can anyone offer any advice, due to travel next week to Faro from Manchester, no air bridge in place and gov website states all but essential travel. Simply cannot go due to quarantine when back, and children due back in school and other half not working from home.Ryanair have said they cant refund as flight is not cancelled, its my choice. No option for vouchers either, the cost to change my flight to next year is costly too. Ryanair are wavering this fee for all new bookings from June on wards but not flights booked prior. We booked these flights at Christmas, before COVID was known. Is anyone in the same boat that they are now not in a position to travel and quarantine on return? Have i just got to accept that i'm set to lose all my flight money? My insurance is valid but the excess isnt worth the claim. Thanks"
"My understanding of this matter is that you either have to quarantine or take a covid-19 test. This is still your personal responsibility. Now it depends on what you want to do, how much you invested on this vacation and whether or not you still want to go given the social distancing guidelines/face mask use. Only you are able to make this decision."
The air bridge concept is useless these days given that the UK is one of the worst countries in Europe when it comes to covid-19.
"If the flight is operating you are not entitled to a refund - your only option would be a travel insurance claim ""The air bridge concept is useless these days given that the UK is one of the worst countries in Europe when it comes to covid-19."" - Having flattened the curve the UK Gov is simply trying to keep it under control by imposing restrictions on countries with spikes in infection numbers."

"Louis if I were you I'd concentrate on the utter cluster f£$k that is your own country before ""trying"" to understand whats going on in the UK. To be honest judging by most of your posts you really don't understand a lot."
OP when did you take out your travel insurance? It’s possible if it was before March you might be. covered for losing your flights
“OP when did you take out your travel insurance? It’s possible if it was before March you might be. covered for losing your flights”Disinclination to travel is rarely covered by travel insurance. OPs flight is operating and he is disinclined to travel.
"""Disinclination to travel is rarely covered by travel insurance. OPs flight is operating and he is disinclined to travel.""I think the most common coverage would be an allowance on change fees if the OP meets certain criteria or misses his/her flight."
I thought Portugal was one of the countries not on FCO green list that’s why I suggested travel insurance.
">>My insurance is valid but the excess isnt worth the claim.<<If that's the case, then you'll just have to write it off."
"Welcome to the forums BSK.Yes, we are in the same 'boat' as you - Ryanair Manchester to Mallorca late Aug flight, booked in Jan. Like you we have (reluctantly) chosen not to travel, same sort of reasons as you have stated. For various reasons I was leaving it until May to get travel insurance, but Covid scuppered that at the time. So I've no travel insurance on which to claim.Unless Ryanair cancel (unlikely it seems as our flight is currently operating daily), I expect to write off those flight costs.(The Mallorcan accommodation owner has been brill; zero charge for this year, deposit transferred to next year)."
"I'd have also suggested insurance, providing it covers for FCO advisories. They must have been really cheap flights or your excess is massive, to make a claim not worth it. Other than that it's change them or lose them."
<< The air bridge concept is useless these days given that the UK is one of the worst countries in Europe when it comes to covid-19. >>Classic! You've missed what's going on in your own covid ridden country then.
"<< The air bridge concept is useless these days given that the UK is one of the worst countries in Europe when it comes to covid-19. >>Not so, at the moment we are doing pretty well compared to many other countries. That’s not to say things may change. In this awful pandemic what happed in the past is irrelevant, it’s what’s happening in the present that’s important. Talk about calling the pot kettle black. I guess Louis won’t understand that!"
