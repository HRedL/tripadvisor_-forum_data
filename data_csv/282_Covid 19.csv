I am meant to be travelling to Porto next weekend for 3 nights and am worried about the evolving Covid 19 situation.... has it had much impact yet in Porto ?
"You have another post about this https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g26185…Answering shortly, we have cases in Portugal and the north of the country, till now all with origin in Italy and one in Spain. Not that different from Ireland, except that apparently there you have at least one case not known where the person contracted Covid-19."
Looks ok so far Eimear99. We are flying out the weekend after you. Fingers crossed! Have a great time!
Today's update https://www.dgs.pt/em-destaque/relatorio-de-…
How is Covid 19 impacting on daily life in Porto? Meant to be arriving on Fri morn? Still unsure as to whether to travel.
"Still unsure as to whether to travel - that's the answer to your question, don't do it if you have doubts... nobody will assure you that you'll be ok. The virus is here and as you can see on the link on previous posts it's having more impact in the northern area. There are already some major disruptions with colleges being closed and the option of a national closing of schools and museums/sites are being discussed today."
I fly in tomorrow so let’s see. I know quinta da Pôpa winery in the Douro Valley is closed as they sent an email cancelling all reservations.
Any update on this? I am due to travel on the 21st March. Is everything still open and running?
"Decided not to travel... things escalating here in Ireland... I am a teacher and announcement today that all schools, preschools, colleges close with immediate effect today. Hopefully there will be other opportunities to visit beautiful Porto..."
I am still planning on visiting on Sunday 22 March for 5 nights. Its an ever changing situation though so will just keep an eye on things.
"Is everything still open and running? No, the municipalities are closing their museum/sites, tourism offices and so on. The main national museums are still open at this point. Life is going on as normal as possible.Edited: 3:32 am, March 13, 2020 "
We have just had our apartment in Porto cancelled by the owner(due to fly out 20th March ) as he says the situation is deteriorating in Porto and he can no longer safely accommodate us . We still have our flights booked but really don’t know if to try and book another apartment/hotel or just cut our losses.Does anyone else have any info What the situation is ?
"Some airlines (TAP included) are allowing a free change of flights to another date, it may be worth doing that instead of risking losing money by cancelling."
"Portugal declared 'state of alert' that will run until April 9, when the situation would be reavaluated. Cruise ships will not be allowed to disembark passengers at the country's docks, except those who live in Portugal. Night clubs will also be closed and capacity restrictions on entry to shopping malls and restaurants are to come into force. Restaurants will have to reduce their seating capacity by 1/3. The new measures come into force at midnight on Monday. The vast majority of museums/sites are closed all over the country."
"Kerreve, you probably decided to book 3 days here thinking of having a good time! That is no longer possible. I don't know what you intended to do, but you cannot go to the beach, take tram, visit Lello bookshop, have a beer or something else at a bar, visit a museum or other sites. Talk with the airline and see what they say."
Hi I am travelling to Porto on Tuesday 17th. You mentioned about not being able to go to the beach? Are restaurants and bars still open as normal? What about the hop on hop off bus? Many thanks
"I think you did not read what ptnov posted: we are in ""state of alert"". And yes, beaches are not allowed:https://sicnoticias.pt/especiais/coronavirus…"
"Up until this morning we were still going to try and get there on 22nd March. We are now assuming we are not going. Our hotel, NH Porto Batalha says that we cannot get a refund as we booked a non refundable room. I've asked what happens if the hotel closes and they said we will still not get a refund! Very disappointing to lose so much money and a bad advert for NH hotels. I'm assuming we will get our money back from Easyjet if they cancel the flight."
"Having carefully watched the situation ramp up in the last day or two (and it’s only headed one way) we’ve decided we won’t be on the plane tomorrow. No refund of course, but think it’s the right thing to do in the circumstances, especially when the entire world is making efforts to reduce travel and contact. Great pity as we were really looking forward to our break, but can’t see how we’d enjoy ourselves when most places are closed or operating with restrictions, and I certainly can’t blame them."
"Cuntoir, I hope you can visit my city in the future. It is a really beautifull city, but now almost everything is closed, so the best sites you could not visit. There are lot's of places absolutely gorgeous and you don't even have to pay to get there, like the beautifull gardens of Palácio de Cristal (they are closed). Anyother time you want to visit us, we will be more than happy! Meanwhile, stay safe, stay healthy."
Are upcoming holidays to Portugal in any doubt due to COVID-19 ?
So relieved I didn’t take the flight on Friday morning. The situation seems to be escalating hourly in both Portugal and Ireland as indeed right across Europe. I hope all my TA friends stay safe and that we will all be back shortly on this wonderful website trying to plan future holidays.
"Thanks for the reply , our airline Ryanair have allowed our family to rebook Porto (free of charge) flights for next February and with our apartment owner in Porto cancelling and giving us a full refund we luckily haven’t lost any money . We will get to see Porto eventually!"
"Helenalfa, definitely hope to visit once things settle. In the meantime, I’ve just received notification from easyJet that my holiday (due to fly from Manchester tomorrow) has been cancelled - others please note. Perhaps for the best. Hope the City and everyone recovers from this awful situation quickly."
"Cuntoir and Kerreve: You MUST visit this wonderfull city! Count on me for everything you might need in terms of information! Meanwhile, thank you both (and your families) for not coming now! Stay well, stay safe!"
"Helenafla wrote ""but you cannot go to the beach, take tram,' can you give more info,why can the people not go to the beach and Is metro not running?"
"Goijbes, police at the beach, no people allowed there. Trams are touristic, so not working. Metro is working, but with restritions about the nr of people allowed. We are trying to work from home, but that is not possible for everybody. So, some people have to take public transports (at bus the main change is that one go inside trough the back door). Well, anyway... yes metro still working, and very important for working people. Tourists as you can understand are not welcome at present times. Why don't people just STAY HOME?"
"Was your flight to Faro, Porto or Madeira which was cancelled!"
"Sorry to hear that Cuntoir. You must be on the same flight as we are next Sunday. What time did Easyjet let you know and did they email you or ring? Also, did they offer you a full refund?Many thanks"
"Cuntoir, the 07.10 Easyjet flight from Manchester left on time and arrived in Porto on time according to Manchester Airport flight information. Was that the time you were due to go?"
"We were due on the 7:10am out of Manchester this morning. EasyJet emailed and text me last night at around 8:00pm. And yes, they’ve advised of a full refund within the next few days. We had already decided we were not going and I spoke to easyJet yesterday, although I was waiting on the phone for 2hrs 15mins before getting through to someone! I asked if, under the circumstances, I could rebook for a later date, but the only option I was given was to cancel and/or simply not turn up. Either way, they weren’t offering a refund. We’d already resigned ourselves to the fact that we weren’t going so we’d written off getting anything back. I was therefore pleasantly surprised when I received notification later, that the holiday was cancelled and we’d be getting a full refund. Helenafla has provided really good advice over the last few days. This really isn’t a time when non essential travel should be undertaken.We have friends who flew to Lanzarote yesterday. Last night they advised that everything appeared ‘normal’. This morning however they have awoken to discover that they’ve been put in total lockdown and to remain in their hotel where fortunately at least, they have food and drink.......for the time being."
"If the flight did operate today, I guess there will have been people at Porto expecting to be returned?"
"Hi Cuntoir, thanks for your response. I bet you are right, the flight may have gone out pretty much empty this morning to pick up passengers waiting in Porto.We are in exactly the same boat as you have been. Hopefully Easyjet will contact us next Saturday to advise of the cancellation and refund. We have resigned ourselves to losing the money too but if we can at least get that back it would be something.NH Hotels have now said that we can rearrange our stay up until 30 August but we are unsure what to do as we don't know how this will all pan out.Thanks for your reply. Hopefully we will all get to Porto one day!"
"We are currently in Porto. All museums and big attractions have been closed. About 50% of restaurants have closed and the rest are at limited capacity and have closed outdoor terraces. It is still a lovely place and there is plenty to see, but day by day it's getting quieter."
We're supposed to be visiting for 4 nights on 25th. Really can't see us coming but until Foreign office put it on the no travel list I suspect we can't claim on insurance as we've got non refundable apartment.
I'm supposed to be going in May but if things dont improve I'm either going to cancel my trip or reschedule it for later in year.
Our flights are now cancelled but the Apartments are still saying they are open. Is this really the case in Porto. Surely with the state of Emergency they should now be closed
"We are in the same position, flights cancelled, but to late to get a cancellation on our apartment, surely they can’t still be carrying on as normal. Appreciate this is no ones fault, even if they offered a change of dates, which would help, but no we can’t even do that !"
"WE're the same - if they offered change of dates we would take them up. If not, then we would be veery unlikely to use them again."
"Completely agree with you, I will look to book elsewhere in the future."
I’ve read reports of all businesses In Porto that can have been closed down. Does this include river cruises?
"Does this include river cruises? Of course, Portugal is in state of emergency, now all those activities are forbidden by law.all businesses In Porto that can have been closed down - restaurants can do takeaway and that it. All the rest is closed."
