"Scam - paid twice in error through THEIR website. Got refund for one of the payments. Then they cancelled the reservation days before it was to start. So, I asked for the rest of my money. 2 months later still working with credit card company. They advertise through HomeAway and their affiliates; VRBO.... So, be careful. The property manager's name is Paul. Anyone else been scamed by this company? Think the word should get out about this disreputable company as well as pressure applied to HomeAway for allowing them to use their platform."
"There is already a fairly long thread running about the company, probably no need to start another discussion."
Problems with this company have been reported before. Which is why you should check out forums like this before booking.
"Attention - Scam - phishing A éviterNous avons réservé un appartement à Paris au mois de mars 2019 malheureusement sans s’informer en avance sur le propriétaire « Paul » parislondonapartments.Lors du paiement nous avons constaté que seulement une petite partie du paiement a été effectuée via le site Homelidays sous ""HOMEAWAY EUR DublinIE"". Nous avons reçu un message m’indiquant que la transaction bancaire via Homelidays a été refusée et que la somme restante doit être payée via un lien dans le courriel: psp.transactium.com à Malte. Le paiement est apparu sous ""MYCENTRALAPARTMENTS NAXXAR MT"". Nous avons essayé de joindre le propriétaire pour clarifier la situation et cette transaction suspecte mais il ne nous a pas fourni de téléphone. Ils nous ont également demandé via courriel des informations confidentielles telles que le code CVV de ma carte bancaire afin de confirmer la réservation de l’appartement sans aucune raison valable. Nous avons demandé le numéro de téléphone pour pouvoir discuter des détails de la location et clarifier la demande de CVV. Nous n’avons jamais réussi à l’obtenir. Nous avons également noté que les 23 références sur le logement mentionné ont disparu sur le site www.homelidays.com le 15 mars, leur site web www.parislondonapartments.com ne fonctionne pas et la société exerce ses activités sous les différents noms.La situation nous a parue très suspecte et nous avons contacté la plateforme Homelidays qui nous a demandé tous les détails sur la réservation, justificatif de paiement y compris, mais son aide et initiative se termine là et le propriétaire continue à publier ses annonces sur le site. Malheureusement il n’y a pas de possibilité de partager notre expérience sur le site Homelidays.Nous avons décidé de résilier le contrat de location pour raison de perte de confiance et par conséquent, nous avons demandé à ce que la totalité de notre paiement me soit restitué. Sans réponse…..Voici des extraits des messages qui nous ont été adressés :“Thank you for choosing to book with us through Homeaway/VRBO for your Parisian stay. Please note the full payment was unable to be processed on your credit card. We kindly ask that you contact your bank as soon as possible to understand why the transaction may have been refused and inform them of the transaction amount to be processed so that they do not block it. “ “Thank you for your recent booking with us, In order to collect your full payment we require CVV number (3 digit number on the back of your c.card)We kindly ask you to send this information to us, so we can confirm your booking.Best Regards,Paul“"
Tou were wise to get away. a Maltese bank account. Asking for 3 digit code. Smelling a big rat.

Traveler -- Why would post a link to help promote a company you seem to dislike?
"Pas de publicite Pour informationJe pense qu il pourrait etre utile a la communaute de savoir que le meme ""proprietaire"" pas fiable exerce sous differents noms, voila."
We rented from them in London via Bookings. They insisted on a GBP 400 deposit which we still have to get back. There is something seriously wrong with this company. Keep away
I am also awaiting for my deposit back and I have reported them to https://reporting.actionfraud.police.uk/login You can do the same if you have concerns. The information about their company can be found here https:/…officers
"Just wanted to let you know that I have got deposit back, after mentioning police in my communications. They deserved that report."
"DO NOT USE THEM!!!!No refunds provided during Covid-19 world wide pandemic. Greedy bastards, inhumane people!!!"
"nice apartment very well located. fast check in.BUT I was very very disappointed with the rental company and its staff. They charged twice the rent on my credit card the same day, and only refunded one charge after three days. Is it a scam ? I lost Euro 40 because of the exchange rate. And when complaining to them, they didn't even excuse themselves for the trouble (I prefer not to write what I think about Paul the manager). Also, the deposit is charged on your credit card. GBP 400. I had to send three reminders to get it back. Even wrote to the rental company owners thru linkedin. Got it back after one month. And lost again Euro 60 because of the exchange rate. Why can't they just take a pre-authorization like hotels do ??? Though all was good with the apartment location/cleanless/etc... I would really not recommend renting thru this company parislondonapartments.com. thanks"
">> … and only refunded one charge after three days. Is it a scam ? I lost Euro 40 because of the exchange rate. <<When in the world has the Euro been that dynamic, that 3 days made a difference of 40 Euro?"
I was also scammed by Paul and Paris London Apartments during the COVID-19 outbreak. I would hesitate to use VRBO or Homeaway at all In. the future and definitely avoid. Paris London Apartments and Paul..
Same experience - they are horrible.
Stay away from this apartment and this company. This is a scam. We stayed several nights in Feb and the deposit of €400 has not been refunded. They do no longer answer the phone or reply to emails or texts. Paul and this company are thieves and will be reported.
First bad experience ever on Airbnb. I could not go to London because of the covid. ParisLondonApartments doesn't want to refund me at all (I paid 730 euros). It is just a machine to make money. Impossible to discuss with them. How comes Airbnb keeps their page alive and let always new people fall into this trap?
