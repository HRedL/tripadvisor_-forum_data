"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Special Information:https://bit.ly/2HLLnfWCOVID-19 can spread from person to person. This usually happens through respiratory droplets—when someone with the virus coughs or sneezes, and you breathe it in. Most often, you need to be close to the person (within 6 feet) for it to spread this way. It might be possible to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. But this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."

press is reporting that additional tests mentioned in #18 have confirmed positive result for covid19.this Wednesday there will be a press conference by Ministry of Health
Brazil has confirmed the first case of the coronavirus in a 61-year-old patient in São Paulo. The man has a history of traveling to Italy for work.
"Not surprising since Brazil does have the most Italians outside of Italy.Was a little surprised not to have seen even 1 case reported, up until yesterday, for the entire continent of South America.With one of the largest parties on earth already in town curious if and how many infected people might have gotten past immigration in spite of stricter entry procedures.Coming to Rio in 3 weeks, hope the numbers in Brazil remain low (and accurately reported)."

They will land on a different platform and there they will have different controls. They will also sign an affidavit saying that they have not felt any kind of symptoms.”Every week, 12 direct flights from Italy arrive at Ezeiza. An additional number of passengers arrive weekly from the same European destination via connections, particularly through Spain or Brazil."
"Thanks for the update MonteCD, indeed it is a worrying situation both in Brazil and Argentina, as the spread of the disease continues to grow."
"more details about the confirmed case in Brazil:patient traveled to Italy between Feb. 9 and 20 and stayed in northern Italy (Lombardy).returned to Brazil on Feb. 21,,, not directly from Italy, but rather on a flight from Paris to São Paulo (so it could be either Latam or Air France, airlines which operate nonstops on that route).first symptoms on Feb. 23; went to Albert Einstein Hospital in SP on Feb.24; final diagnosis confirmation Feb. 25patient is doing fine and no complications.besides his immediate family, health authorities are contacting people who sat close to patient on flight."
"some airlines that fly to Brazil are already allowing changes and/or refunds for passengers that have some Italian airports as final destination (besides previous similar measures to points in China and other places in Asia).conditions vary by airline and are a moving target.examples are British Airways, Iberia, Delta, Air Europa, Azul, Turkish, Cabo Verde Airlines... list may grow as situation develops,[and the aforementioned Brazilian national that tested positive for covid19 flew on one of the two daily Air France nonstop flights between Paris CDG and São Paulo GRU airports]"
"how confident are you that the Brazilian government is releasing accurate information regarding infected counts....given how important Carnaval was to the economy, what are the chances that numbers (only 1 so far and completely unrelated) are/were being understated?I am still planning on going in less than 3 weeks, but curious.Edited: 4:43 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"El Chevere, given the general paraonia that is rising every day more and more, I'd say the Government wants to make sure they can handle the situation properly. The infected patient flew from France (and not Italy on a direct flight). Detecting possible cases when landing, should lower the chances of spreading.I think the situation is far worse in the States than in Brazil as of today, at least in possitive cases.Edited: 5:30 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"confident - as the travel flow between Brazil and China is not huge (though it has been increasing)... and most travelers are from the Brazilian states with better health systems; better equipped to detect them.e.g. as reported on this thread, there had been a number of cases under investigation; all discarded up to this one... for a case to be ""possible"", all it took it was someone coming from China PLUS having some very generic flu-like symptoms.now that the list of ""possible countries"" has been greatly expanded, there are 130 ""potential cases"" being investigated as of now... the vast majority of them will turn out to be negative (like everywhere, since symptoms are very generic);contrast that to US (which has a much bigger travel flow to China, Asia, Europe) than Brazil... U.S. CDC does not even release number of cases under investigation any more... I would be far more worried about covid19 in the US than in Brazil ...https:/…or to the Netherlands - a place that has direct flights to China; first confirmed case there was only today... Brazil does not even have nonstop flights to China... closest to it is a Sao Paulo-Madrid-Beijing route operated by Air China (with change of crew etc in Spain; we have already used it to go to Spain).... people here fly to China thru hubs using mostly airlines like Emirates, Qatar, Turkish, or thru Europe or to a lesser extent USA.situation will change as Italy (and rest of Europe) is hit harder, as the travel flow (and flights etc) is much larger between Brazil and Europe than to Asia overall... that is why some airlines are now allowing people in Brazil to make changes to flights to Italy.Brazil has been very transparent with far more deadly diseases (like yellow fever) or far more contagious diseases (like measles)...there are other factors in play... numbers are released at state level (and sometimes municipal too) - there are 26 states plus federal dstrict - so info gets to press from a wide range of sources; much more difficult to try to avoid dissemination of info compared to if it only came from one point... e.g. see the yellow fever thread (we see reports of cases at state (or even local) level before they are compiled nationwide... and much before it gets reported in English-language sources; the same will happen with covid19 if it gets to spread to other points; media here has been all over it:https:/…105745276[but you overstate tourism as part of Brazilian economy (and possible incentive to ""hide it"" for Carnaval)... Brazil only receives 6-7 million foreign visitors per year; that includes every one (business, tourism etc)... the biggest numbers (more than half) are other South Americans (especially Argentines and Chileans) who come mostly for beach time in Brazil thruout the year - not Carnaval only]"
"Further to below, I'd argue that it would be very difficult for any government to hide the real rate of fatalities if that got serious.With that in mind, we can probably assume that the rate of infections is higher than reported, but mortality is lower, as most cases of Corona will pass as milder versions than the ones being captured in tests.It is also still summer in South America, which should slow the spread of the virus."
btw... add Air France/KLM to list of companies allowing changes to flights to Italy under certain conditions.
"this is how Brazilian health authorities expanded list of countries to investigate ""possible cases""1. China2. on Feb 21, more countries added: Japan, Singapore, South Korea, North Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia3. Feb. 24: Germany, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Philippines, France, Iran, Italy, Malaysia(inclusion of France, Germany and Italy is what really made number of ""possible cases under investgation"" to jump significantly) [list will probably continue to grow and, consequently, number of ""possible"" cases]"

"Hello there,Days have passed and we still have one confirmed case under full treatment, one only!!Let's reduce the paranoia, keep our lives as they are, stop touching everywhere and washing our hands thoroughly and correctly - it's just a flu not the plague!!Vítor"
Let’s stop underplaying the dangers of Coronavirus (COVID-19). It’s not “just a flu.” Brazil is currently investigating at least 182 suspected cases of the disease—and that’s with very limited testing.It’s far more important to know all aspects of what is happening regarding the virus in Brazil than to dismiss relevant facts in order to provide economic cover for those whose travel businesses might be negatively affected.
"as far as previous questions about Latin America overall...it was a matter of time to hit the area once it hit Europe and North America (areas in Northern Hemisphere with far larger flows of people to Latin America than China)... and Latin America is basically farther from China than any other region, so it makes sense to be the last one to be hit...Mexico confirmed 3 cases (all linked to northern Italy travel) and Ecuador one (linked to travel to Spain)."
"Of course we are all worried here in South America about COVID19. But in my humble opinion, 3 confirmed cases in all Latin-America seem less of a worry when compared to 68 in the US alone, for example. And I believe it has disrupted more traveling to/from US that to/from Brazil at the moment.Edited: 2:37 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Sorry, I meant 5 cases in all Latin-America."

Yesterday, SP government started following the onslaught of USA restrictions - limits on number of people gathered, school closings coming soon. Everyone is starting to pay attention now, but there's still a pervasive air of ""there's nothing to worry about"". (Plus all the social myths, such as blacks/persons of African heritage can't get coronavirus. Uh, not true.). We're staying close to home, a small family friends gathering tomorrow at a boteco. No more big gatherings for us and no more subway for the time being. Whether it's the (not very warm) summer weather is keeping the numbers down remains to be seen; my gut tells me it's just a lack of testing and the testings done so far have been under very limited protocols.

Gut feeling is that any closure of IG would be in Brazilian media, which is not. Cruise ship stops may be already banned, but not other means of transportation to IG.

Just been confirmed that all non essential travel out of the UK is suspended for 30 days and anyone still abroad should attempt to return back to the UK. We were due to fly out Tuesday to Rio. Also just received confirmation from our hotel that Ilha Grande is closed for 14 days.
Best thing to do right now is to stay put and halt all unnecessary travel plans. Stay healthy people!
"Thank you all who are posting here. Great information. Thanks to Monte for getting it started. I have a daughter currently living in Rio.She seems to be keeping up with all the latest news.Very scary situation for the entire world. If anything, this seems to be bringing people together, but my fear is that things could turn ugly. We are in Arizona and when out sightseeing and in the small town of Page/out in the desert at a McDonald’s one of the workers make a derogatory comment about “all these Chinese,” in the McDonald’s we were in. The employee making the comment was clearly a simple minded person. The customers she was pointing at and referring to were not Chinese, but South Korean. Bottom line, I worry about people turning on each other before all is said and done. We were seeing some typical tourist sites when we arrived here for Spring Break, but have now stopped. My other daughter is in Germany. Very afraid for her because she tends to have respiratory issues.My husband (who is Brazilian) and I were commenting on Bolsonaro and Trump’s silliness with their hand shaking. They’ve shown some completely inappropriate behavior in terms of how this virus spreads. They need to be setting an example and making their nations feel more secure. I think now both are becoming more somber. My daughter in Rio was in the process of renewing her Brazilian passport. She is unsure how all that will work now, because the office she was to report to was at a mall and the malls are now being closed. I think all the sheltering in place is coming a beat too late. In Texas we call it “hunkering down.” We do it on an annual basis almost, due to our hurricane season. Right now I am still in Phoenix, but longing to go home to Texas. Scary to have my family scattered to the wind. Hope everyone can stay well. It just seems inevitable that we will all get this."

Thanks for passport link. She says it does not expire till June.She had already put in application & payment. When she arrived for her appointment she was told “the system is down.”I guess that was just an easier answer. She will return on Friday. She was told to reschedule her appointment for then. Doesn’t make much sense. She basically put all the info she was given in google translate.Her concern is that her stuff will just be hung up in the system.She has no travel plans at this time.
"@mojomo #140:passports: one of the exceptions is if passport is already ready for pickup AND person can prove that he/she will travel in next 30 daysGlobo productions: it is actually a VERY important development in terms of severity of situation trickling down to general population (see my previous comments about only people who travel intl being initially concerned about it)... as daily telenovelas (soap operas) are wildly popular, the suspension of productions - which will cause Globo to start having to show reruns or previous telenovelas in some time - will drive the message for the entire population.[no, telenovelas in Brazil are not all recorded in advance... they go on air with a certain number of installments recorded... and production continues while it is still on air... that is one of the reasons of their success, as plot, characters etc can be changed according to public reaction... I have family that works at Globo and already knew about it, but I try to only post comments here once they are official..]btw, it is not only the telenovelas, but a lot of Globo productions are being suspended - that has never happened in decades of Globo history... it is switching to many re-runs and vastly expanding time dedicated to local and other news... as you can imagine, a lot of it covid19-related.last night, Globo used the current edition of Big Brother Brasil (yes, it is still popular here in its 20th season) to have an epidemiologist live explaining to participants (locked up in a house) what is going on in the ""real world"", and taking the time to show how to wash hands properly. social distancing measures etc... all of that filters thru general population, which is only really becoming aware of seriousness of covid19 in past couple of days; as you can imagine, in a country with social disparity like Brazil, a lot of people never set foot on a plane, so they were not really paying attention to it"
"OMG, thank you so much for your response!I am such a huge fan of the Brazilian novelas. I cannot tell you what they have meant to me over the years. Way back to Agua Viva and Coracão Alado!!!!Tarcisio Meira, be still my heart. I actually got to meet him here in the States. He is like the Brazilian Clark Gable IMO. A real man, lol. I suspected as much about production when recently the Chiclete character became a larger role due to popularity. Aaaah Chiclete. I love Sergio Guize too. So I am holding on and noticing a possible acceleration in the plot of Amor De Mãe. Maybe just my imagination. But it feels a lot is being revealed quickly. Not sure where else the plot can go.But that is the beauty of the Brazilian novela. They are beloved the world over.Edited: 3:25 pm, March 17, 2020 "

"Unrecognized, milder cases of COVID-19 are likely the driving force behind the rapid spread of the virus throughout the world, a new study suggests.People with recognized infections were sicker and more contagious. They are the ones who got and largely followed orders to isolate themselves from others.86% of infections were mild enough that people didn’t seek medical care or confirmation of their symptoms. These milder cases were only about half as contagious as the recognized infections, but because there were so many more of these undocumented cases than the documented ones, the unrecognized cases were the ones fanning the flames of the outbreak.https://wb.md/2IYN6zo"

"@Greg,if you can follow Portuguese (or have your husband do it).... you can watch Globo News (channel 40) or Band News (channel 79)... and the recently launched CNN Brasil (channel 77)... they are nonstop news channels in Portuguese; as you can imagine, a lot of their programming now talks about covid19 and related issues"
"some updates:- as Greg mentioned, between March 23 and April 30 shopping malls to close in SP metro area; gyms too;- all international bus lines suspended for 60 days- as I write this, there is a press conference by President of Brazil; all his ministers are wearing masks since two federal-govt ministers have now tested positive for covid19 (several people, more than a dozen, of the presidential entourage of recent visit to US have already tested positive); it does not sound like major travel/border restrictions are being announced (besides previously announced border closure of Venezuela);"
We are due to travel to Rio in 16 days. Can anyone tell me what the current situation is ? My outbound flight is cancelled but the rest of my booking appears to be live and valid. I am not completely succumbed that we might not still be able to go? am i wrong to think this ? Or shall I just cancel what hasn't been cancelled and get on with it!
"I'm sorry, but cancel as fast as you can, my opinion. Everything is changing literally by the minute, and it's absolutely leaning strongly in the Worse First Rather Than Better."
"Fellow, these are certainly times to avoid all unnecessary travel. Check with your airline, because if the outbound has been cancelled, so should be the rest of the reservation. Things are moving fast and the best we can do as travelers is to stay put."
"Hi - are you all self isolating in Rio yet? Are the bars / restaurants / beaches etc all shut down? I’m due to visit in two weeks time (Apr 2nd - 15th). The plan was 4 nights in Rio (2nd - 5th), 3 nights in Ilha Grande (6th - 8th), 6 nights in Club Med Resort (nr Mangaratiba) (9th - 14th), fly back to UK on 15thEverything is still booked at this point, so I’m trying my best to follow the daily developments at the moment (with the hope that by end of Mar things take a turn for the better) (unlikely I know)"
"Matt, Ilha Grande is closed for at least 15 days (and it could well go on more than that), inter-city buses from/to Rio has been also curtailed.Flights are also another nightmare right now. I would advice you to seriously postpone your trip until things get better with the virus spread."
People are self isolating!
"I'd say it's the best we all can do, avoid socializing as much as possible at least the virus gets contained and restrained."
"Matt and Fellow Travelers, #156 and 159..here in Brazil it will get worse before it gets better; experts saying peak in April/May; that is an estimate based on what happened in Italy, etc.flights being canceled all the time... your flights may be there today, but be gone tomorrow and then you find yourself stranded in a foreign country (scores of travelers worldwide in that situation; dont expect being able to contact airlines easily; they are swamped with calls).... follow this thread below and keep checking your flight reservations (airlines are being rather slow to keep up with all changes; they simply do not have the staff to deal with volume):https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29428…even worse if you are in a smaller city, away from a major airport and have difficulty getting to the major gateways for flights out of Brazil (Sao Paulo GRU, then a distant second, Rio GIG)"
Can someone help me understand cancelation policies for Gol airline? If the airline cancels flight due to the situation can one get fully reembursied? Cancelling my mid May to Rio and need to cancel doméstica flight on Gol. If the airline cancels dont they have to reembuirse fully independente of ticket category?
"You might be elegible for a fully reimbursement, however some charges may apply. You need to contact GOL as soon as possible and see what your options are. But if you were to travel in May, I'd wait for them to cancel on you."
"Yep, half of what you listed on there is already closed - Ilha Grande, Rio and its tourist attractions, bars, clubs, beaches, etc. You'll be coming here into a ghost town, compared to ""regular"" Rio on any other given day. Save your money and come back later in the year."
"updates coming at a dizzying pace from all over Brazil... as federal govt has been reluctant to implement nationwide measures, scores of state and local authorities are doing what they can within their own jurisdctions:- mayor of city of São Paulo closing retail shops thru April 5: mandatory effective Friday (March 20), but ""recommended"" from tomorrow (March 19).... major exceptions are supermarkets, food service places (restaurants, bakery etc) gas stations and drugstores;- some retail chains extending closing voluntarily to more locations;- Salvador, Brasília, Porto Alegre, state of Santa Catarina (where Florianopolis, Camboriu etc are) etc also closing malls etc, with varying scopes and time periods;- large bus company 1001 cancelled all interstate services to/ from Rio;- four confirmed deaths - in São Paulo.- another high ranking official, Mr. David Alcolumbre, head of the Brazilian Senate also tested positive for covid 19-state of Paraná (where Iguaçu Falls is located) suspending all incoming intercity buses from several states (São Paulo; Rio de Janeiro; Federal District; Bahia).... other state authorities also suspending intercity bus lines;- the heavily populated SP metro area suburbs known as ""Grande ABC"" (Santo André, São Bernardo, São Caetano do Sul, Diadema, Mauá, Ribeirão Pires. Rio Grande da Serra) suspended all public transportation."
"Thanks for the update Rokatoo, indeed measures are moving fast, but I wonder if they are not running short in time to prevent more spreading and casualties."
"Coronavirus hits Brazilian economy:https://reut.rs/397nnPXSão Paulo Governor Joao Doria on Wednesday recommended the closure of shopping malls in the metro area of the country’s biggest city. Several mall operators had already announced reduced shopping hours.São Paulo city hall also ordered commercial establishments closed to the public from Friday until April 5, with exceptions for deliveries, pharmacies, gas stations, supermarkets and food service."
"I have a flight from London to Rio with a layover in Germany 17-25 April. I'm booked with Lufthansa via Expedia (flight and accommodation). My tours are booked with AIRBNB Experiences. Right now none of these operators have cancelled my trip and I have got no notifications. What do I do? Also, it cost me a large fee if I cancel now."

Banks in Rio may close soon to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. A number of bank managers are talking to customers to update electronic access to their accounts.
"It's getting out of control. Here in Argentina the banks allow small amounts of people at once, and the first two operation hours are strictly for elderly atention only."
"@sjd #170is you flight Frankfurt-Rio with Lufthansa?if so, those flghts have been canceled thru April 12 (those cancelations may be extended; many airlines are cancelling to certain dates; as situation develops, they extend cancelations farther out)... see #13 on this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29428…airlines are swamped with calls at the moment, so they are dealing with passengers in coming days first (not to mention people stranded all over the world).as you booked thru expedia. you have to go thru expedia to get refunds, rebooking etc. This link is helpful:https:/…25643Expedia has also this message on its website:""A note to our travelers: If your trip is not within the next 7 days, please hold off calling customer service so we can help those traveling immediately. Thank you.""keep checking airbnb pages for their upades and policies; everything is changing all the timeEdited: 11:49 am, March 19, 2020 "
My flight isn’t for a few weeks so I think I’ll keep the booking for now and wait to see how things play out over the next 10 days or so. No real point in cancelling prematurely
"updates:1. Brazil is closing for 15 days its LAND borders for non-residents with Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay. Peru, Suriname. Land border with Venezuela had already been closed.... only land border with Uruguay remains open at the moment (specific measures for Brazil-Uruguay border to be announced soon); restrictions do NOT apply to flights (at the moment);2. Ilhabela: access restricted to residents and/or workers... only cars with license plate from Ilhabela or São Sebastião can get on the ferry; pedestrians must show some proof of residence or employment;3. state of Bahia is shutting down several intercity transportation hubs: such as bus terminals in Salvador; Porto Seguro, Bom Despacho (used to get to Morro de São Paulo); that measure affects trips to/from Chapada Diamantina too... for 10 days effective tonight (March 19).google translate state decree:ba.gov.br/noticias/entenda-o-decreto-que-det…4. a number of municipalities with normally heavy tourist flow have banned entry of tour buses, vans etcEdited: 12:41 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Matt, it's ok to wait until the airline cancels on you, it certainly looks that no matter what your choice is, travelling will not be one of them. Better to stay put and home for a while. Cheers!"
I had plans for 13 May to visit Brazil and I am not counting on travelling I think its better safe then sorry.

"updates:1. several state governors are annoucing restrictions on interstate bus travel in Brazil; while unclear if they actually can do that, such announcements are being made any way2. Salvador to close some of its most famous beaches (Porto da Barra; Farol da Barra etc) eff. March 21; more could be closed too;3. cities along the central coast of state of São Paulo, the so called Baixada Santista metro region (Santos, Guarujá etc), will close all beaches, malls, nightclubs, gyms; intercity bus stations for most people; hotels can no longer accept new guests and must completely close down by Monday (March 23)4.

And they should have a travel plan that does not rely on the U.S. Government for assistance."

"Here's a question for anyone local in Rio de Janeiro - if you or anyone with you was to get coronavirus, end up with breathing/respiratory problems (you know, difficulty breathing), what would be the best place to go to, or number to call (do they have some sort of a medical emergency unit here?)It will obviously be a little bit of a challenge with the language I am sure, but just thinking ahead and planning, in the worst case scenario..."
RealCrazySerb: See link:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g30350…
"The coronavirus outbreak is landing in Brazil as the hot summer days in the southern hemisphere draw to a close and winter approaches, potentially worsening the spread of the virus, according to medical experts.https://reut.rs/3a8IouF“There’s never a good moment for the coronavirus to arrive... but this is not a good moment,” said Maria da Gloria Teixeira, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of Bahia."
"RealCrazySerb,besides answer in #186...do you have travel health insurance? contact them for guidance.travel health insurance providers in Brazil (and some of them are major intl companies), gave two answers to their customers:1. initial visit covered by insurance; but then as it is a pandemic, more long term treatment is not2, some of them said they would cover entire treatmentso it really depends on your policy.(and they may vary by where you purchased it)I would seek guidance from Canadian consulate in Rio too (assuming you are a Canadian citizen, given your Toronto location) if one falls ill:https:/…in any case, I would be getting in touch with consulate (if you are a national or resident) to let them know you are in Rio; some countries have a registration system of their citizens abroad, with your contact info etc, so that they can get in touch with you in cases of need to be repatriated, travel advisories etc,[separate question: have you tried changing your flight arrangements to return to your home, where you would be in a better position to deal with any situation like that, if it ever arises? there are still flights in/out of Brazil, but number is being reduced as time goes by.... you may end up stranded in Brazil; e.g. Air Canada will suspend service to/from Brazil soon]see this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29428…"
"Awesome, thank you for the details.Yeah, I'm just calling my travel health insurance provider (never leave home without a long term policy) to see what they might say about all this, but I assume (so far, as I haven't heard any updates from them yet) that they would cover most of the expenses.Was more curious where to go and how to communicate easily the issues, if any arise, as Google Translate will only go so far, and imagine medical emergency where every minute or detail counts.And I've tried booking a flight out end of the month, but most of those companies have now grounded/cancelled the flights so I'm here in Rio until further notice / things change... not that I'm complaining as I'd rather be here in warm climate than in Canada and sub-zero temperatures, where I am 10x more likely to catch the virus too. And not to mention trying to avoid airports at this point at all costs...Thanks again for the info!"
"Hello there,Bear TAP in mind: so far it is still possible to get São Paulo by air, then from there to Lisbon and to Canada!Vítor"
"Yeah, too complicated, too long of a flight, too many airports to risk it all at, and probably too costly... would rather just wait it out here in Brazil, to be honest, as the rate of infected per million is 10x higher in Canada..."
"Brazil’s health system will enter a state of collapse by the end of April, the country’s health minister said on Friday, with coronavirus cases hitting a plateau in July and hopefully falling quickly in September."
"Ministry of Health has just declared there is ""community transmission"" of covid 19 nationwide.while that may seem a technical detail, it can have a significant impact on travel to/from Brazil (already largely affected by flight cutbacks).once that news gets to WHO and then to other health officials worldwide, it is used by many countries as the basis to determine which flights and/or passengers coming from ""community transmission"" countries can land and/or enter that country[community transmission means the transmission was not the result of travel or direct contact with a known carrier]"
"so that people get an idea of what may be in store...city of SP is preparing 2000 beds in improvised field hospitals at the Pacaembu soccer stadium and the Anhembi complex for covid19 patients who do not need ICU hospital beds - similar to what we are seeing now in Italian cities etc... these beds should be ready in 2-3 weeks, when many health experts are expecting a large increase in cases in Brazil."
"Rio's mayor Marcelo Crivella inspected facilities in Jacarepaguá, in the West Zone of Rio, where a City Hall field hospital will be set up with the support of the federal government and Brazil's armed forces.The plan is to install at least 500 beds in the installation, which will admit only patients from the municipal hospitals who need or are recovering from elective surgeries or are undergoing medical care, thereby freeing the beds of other health units."
"The number of positive cases detected today rose considerably, and the dead toll now at 11. As the federal government takes so much time to take a severe measure, things are only to get worse."
What do you know about Brazil closing borders?https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/0…I`m asking that in order to get an upperhand with air france reinbursement plane tickets. Thank you.

It’s strange that flights haven’t been cancelled after 23 March and that you can still book them too. E.g British Airways
"City of Rio: 94 Confirmed cases of COVID-19; Barra and Leblon leading:https://bit.ly/2J7lSqhOf the 29 cases, the highest growth occurred in Leblon, which increased from nine to 16 cases, along with Barra da Tijuca as the neighborhood with the most cases, Barra climbed from 12 to 16."
"Matt, a lot of flights have been canceled anyway. The ban is for non resident passengers, not flights.Brazilians, residents etc still can come back home.The ban is for non resident passengers flying from some countries only. List of course could grow.Passenger flights also carry essential cargo, e.g. medicine, medical supplies etc....for some routes, the combo of returning residents and cargo makes a reduced schedule still feasible. It is a day by day situation.And many airline websites are not keeping up with all changes, I have noticed many taking days to reflect even their own announced flight suspensions."
"Brazil’s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: ‘It will kill a lot of people.’:https://wapo.st/3dlUHFR“The people who brought this were the rich coming from vacations to Europe, but the people who will suffer much more will be the poor,” said Paulo Buss, one of Brazil’s leading public health doctors. “Unfortunately, I think it’s going to be there soon, and we will have big numbers.”Officials are increasingly voicing alarm. Drastic ideas are being floated. The newspaper Estadão reported official talks of isolating infected favela residents on ships at sea."

These measures are intended to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus, said Chile."
"Argentina has closed it's borders a few days ago to all foreigners and non residents. Not a nice measure, but at least only people who live here are allowed to return.

"jorge,if you really want to know my opinion of what FEDERAL govt will do.... it will postpone any such measure as much as possible, like UK, USA, and several other European national govts are doing..... state and local authorities will react at different speeds.but, honestly, my opinion does not matter; all we can do to help is to post verified, reliable information; not rumors or our wishful thinking... situation changes all the time..that is the only way we can help travelers who may be stranded, or have friends/relatives stranded in Brazil, or are still thinking that ""it will be gone in a couple of weeks""anecdotal evidence: SP is nearly deserted today; and more measures kick in this Monday (all schools closed - most are already) and Tuesday (statewide retail closing, except ""essential"" areas)"

"@ Pete #230these new measures just came out today. gut feeling is that MOST flights thru April 30 will be canceled.... so far, neither Gol or Azul are keeping flights to IGU... that area can be reached by roads and would not be completely isolated if ALL flights canceled.wait a bit for more info from your airline; they are swamped coping with these changes.airlines still publishing new schedule; Latam is often the last to do so:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29428…refund etc: rules will probably be determined by WHERE you purchased flight; rules of that jurisdiction should apply.here in Brazil, new rules were implemented only a few days ago: if one purchased tkts in Brazil, airlines can defer refunds up to 12 months (otherwise they would all go belly up in coming weeks); they are also offering to keep amounts as credit for future flights.this is latest I saw on Latam website:https:/…""Change the date of your flight for no additional cost (same destination and cabin class) without penalties or fare differences. The new flight must be completed no later than December 31, 2020.If you have a ticket to fly up to April 30, 2020 and you are unable or do not wish to travel, you can reschedule your journey for a later date or keep the ticket value open for future travel up to December 31, 2020.""[anedoctal experience: we have Gol flights in mid-April to an airport that will have ALL service suspended; we will take the credit option for future flights, as we will eventually fly somewhere some time in Brazil again - if the airline doesnot collapse till then - a number likely will collapse worldwide (same for travel agencies, hotels etc)... we are not going thru the cancelations right now; we will wait a few more days for dust to settle a bit]"
"Hi JorgeYes, rebooking was one of the options but no good for me as sadly I will not be able to make it to Brazil from the UK before December 2020."
"Thanks Rokatoo,I will wait and see what happens over the next week then. I am having similar issues with Aerolineas Argentinas regarding the flight from Buenos Aires to the Argentinian side of Iguazu. They now only have a whatsapp number for customer services and no one is answering!"
"... and that is why you should book ALL flights with a credit card that offers trip cancellation insurance.Thank God I have one as I am now in the process of getting almost $4,000 worth of flights for me and my girlfriend refunded, instead of settling for just an airline credit, for routes that I am never likely to take again..."

"@Greg #385initially, an announcement was supposed to be made at state level on May 8 as to potential easing of social distancing measures; but recent statements by governor have made it clear that no easing will take place (at least in SP metro area and larger cities in state) now, as covid19 is still on the rise; in fact. more strict measures are more likely now in SP metro area;face masks: it is actually mandatory starting today in all public spaces (not only inside businesses you mentioned); on an anecdotal level, yesterday we went to supermarket a few blocks away and indeed more than 90% of people in streets were already wearing them; compliance/enforcement: as everywhere in Brazil, it varies a lot depending on where you are; it is much lower in underpriviliged areas (as there is less police presence in these areas and other factors, such as sheer impossibility of social distancing in crowded substandard housing; education levels, widespread belief in fake news etc etc; e.g. the São Luis lockdown can be seen in effect in certain areas, but largely ignored in outlying less affluent areas of that metro region)"

SP moved a variety of holidays to this past weeks Wednesday Thursday and on coming Monday, in an attempt to get people to stay home. Not exactly effective, as the social isolation rates have not come down (they are below 50 percent) I don't know what Rokatoo thinks, but I anticipate a full lockdown may happen because the informal ""please everyone stay home"" approach hasn't been effective (and that's been in place two months). Lots of masks on streets, but not exactly effective (cough) when they're pulled down constantly around people's necks (our corner boteco, the workers are half masked, the cerveja drinkers outside are unmasked or neck-masked, same with workers inside, clients inside unmasked altogether. All brazil borders, by air/boat/land are closed to foreigners, as of today, for 30 days. (I'm not sure exactly what that's supposed to achieve). I'll be amazed if the US doesn't bar all travel from Brazil.Edited: 11:10 am, May 23, 2020 "
"Greg, I'm sorry to read everyday how the situation is evolving for the worse in Brazil.I think here in Argentina we have really hard challenges to come as well. Only Chile does a decent amount of testing and tracing every day.Let's hope for the best for all of our countries. Greetings from Buenos Aires."

"Rokatoo- thanks as always for your thoughtful remarks (all of which I agree with, completely). you also help me understand Brazil (a strange new world for an American) - your comments about the education levels honestly surprised me, so I greatly appreciate the new perspectives. And yes, SP paulistas get so much of their questionable information from Facebook and WhatsApp. A friend called Friday, upset that SP was going into a full lockdown June 1 and that this was top secret, the press didn't know this yet etc etc. We talked her down off the ledge (no, you're reading an amendment that wasn't considered/wasn't passed, not true, at least not true YET....) Yes, it's the men you describe (aged 40-60, generally) who are maskless/noncompliant.

"state of SP has announced social distancing measures from June 1 afterwards.state has been divided in 18 areas (state has the same area as the UK and about 46 million people)... scroll down in link below and map is color coded by areas; from phase 1 (red) to 5 (blue):https:/…Areas were assigned colors based on two criteria: its current health care capacity (e.g. % of ICU beds still available) and trend in confirmed cases in recent days; areas will be re-assessed weekly and can move up, down, stay the same; but in case some big changes happen in the interim, assessment can change any time.Phase 1 (red) means area stays with current restrictions: applies to suburban metro SP area (e.g where GRU airport is); the central shore (area known as ""Baixada Santista metro area: Santos, Guarujá, São Vicente, Praia Grande etc); southern shore and nearby inland areas;Phase 2: shops can reopen with mandatory face masks etc (malls have some restrictions on capacity, parking space, working hours etc): São Paulo city proper; northern shore (Ubatuba. Ilhabela, São Sebastião) etc and most other regions (including Campinas, where VCP airport is located)Phase 3: allows bar, restaurants, beauty parlors to reopen subject to certain restrictions: only 4 state regions (Barretos, Bauru, Presidente Prudente, Araraquara/São Carlos)Phase 4: e.g. gyms can re-open too (no regions now)Phase 5: back to old life (no regions)now, mayor of city of SP has said that shops will only re-open after ""discussions with local health authorities and establishment of health protocols"" - whatever that means; we will see... SP mayor will have a press conference this Thursday (May 28) about topic.and talking about city of SP proper, link below shows updated (thru May 20) map of confirmed plus suspected covid19 deaths by districts (color coded; darker means more deaths), as mentioned before the northern, eastern and southern edges are the most impacted, especially compared to the better off central-SW corner:https://tinyurl.com/y7a36ylg[if one wonders why the southernmost part has few cases, it is because it is a sparsely populated area; there is even an official ""native indigenous people reservation"" there - yes, within SP city limits]"
"Brazil's coronavirus death toll surpasses 25,000:https://bit.ly/2zDtXlmHospitals are dangerously close to the breaking point in the hardest-hit areas."
"a Brazilian NGO released a very interesting study combining a lot of available public data into a ""municipal-level vulnerability index"" for covid19... the main idea is to assess how each municipality can respond to the outbreak given its specific characteristics in order to decide where additional help could be most needed.it uses data such as % of population in each municipality receiving welfare payments, in higher risk health groups, existing health care facilities nearby (including ICU beds), % of people who have private or only public health care, income levels, etcresults can be seen on a color coded map in link below (then click on ""Navegue pelo sistema de indicadores do IVM"" to see map.... the darker red areas are ""most vulnerable"" municipalities.http://ivm.votorantim.rarolabs.com/results are not surprising, given the well known regional inequalities in Brazil... concentration of vulnerable areas are in Northern (Amazon) and NE Brazil (areas that have the lowest income levels in Brazil)... if one draws an imaginary line dividing Brazil in two, going thru the Federal District (Brasília - easily seen on map as a green rectangle in central Brazil), the rough north-south division becomes quite clear (with some exceptions, of course; e.g. municipalities in soybean-rich areas in state of Mato Grosso and far western parts of Bahia etc have low ""vulnerability"" levels).some of the local disparities become very clear too - most glaring example is state of Goiás... the rectangular void in state map is the Federal District (Brasília; higher income levels due to all those federal govt employees)... and it is surrounded by many ""red"" areas - many of the poorer parts of the Brasília metro area are across state lines (already in Goiás; a lot of people commute daily into the Federal District for work, shopping - and health care)one can also get state maps in larger size by selecting state in dropdown menu labeled ""Região""... and the ""Indicador"" buttons allows one to choose between overall index, as well as a lot of other data - including covid-19 data such as confirmed cases and deaths (""óbitos""), both total and in relation to local population."
"Rokatto, that's an exceptional work right there, lots of useful information. Thanks for sharing."
"Lots of US press this afternoon, dumbfounded that SP is reopening. Did I somehow miss the news that Brazil is no longer the epicenter of the covid crisis? (That's sarcasm, just in case....) With these very fuzzy color-coded stages, I can imagine many here will think ""oh, great! That's over with!"""
"Greg,first, I agree with the comment about""that is over"" train of thought... unfortunately, that ship has already sailed a long time ago for a lot of people; for many people it was never ""problem"" (until, of course, they get to know someone who dies or gets seriously ill)- the ""reopening of SP proper"" is still in the air... yes, it is confusing, but state-level decisions are a ""permission"" for local municipalities to follow the color coded region guidelines (but not to be less strict); not an ""order"" to do it...as mentioned in #474, the mayor of SP did give some details today... basically he said that nothing else will legally reopen in SP on June 1; shops, malls etc will have to submit procedures etc to be vetted by city health authorities; then they are allowed to open...when that will happen? who knows... shopkeepers say they hope ""by end of next week""... to be continued... again, that will only be really enforced in areas where enforcement is a possibility,; in large parts, these rules were never followed, so it will not change anything;[press is unable to report these intrincacies, especially in a foreign language; they will go for the soundbites/headlines translated by google by an intern... not only in covid matters, but those who rely on non-local language press only are doomed to get news with at the very least a delay and often a third- or fourth source that gets quoted and misquoted... seen a lot of that here in TA... I always try to link English-language sources that do have competent people on the ground; after a while we know who they are; if not available, then better use google translate to read some good local source]- now, if some of us find the potential opening up ""too soon/too lenient"" (and I am one of them), there are a lot who find it ""too late/too strict""; there was an outcry by many mayors about ""why were they stuck in the more strict areas?""... this debate is not unique to Brazil; it happens worldwide...then, it is one thing to follow quarantine in Western Europe while still receiving most of your income. quite different being an informal worker in a shantytown in Brazil who has seen livelihood evaporate... cant fault them to think that they should be allowed to earn a living asap, even at risk of covid19; I would not be dismissive of their rationale, as we are aware that we are amongst the fortunate ones who can stay holed up for a long time;- the color coding is actually a good tool - it is a lot easier to understand for most people than administrative lingo about protocols, municipal boundaries, intermunicipal health districts etc etc... it is a graphic tool used by other Brazilian states, many other countries etc etc- the economic impact is getting very heavy after more than 2 months; that will sway more and more people to the camp of ""let's risk it; better dead by covid than of hunger""... data confirming that devastation is starting to come out... Brazil has about only 38 million people with formal jobs (i.e. everybody else is informal, off-the-books, no labor rights etc etc; and I am not talking about ""first world gig economy jobs"" for most of them)... of those 38 million, about 8 million are in ""temporary suspension"" (reduced pay up to 70%, hours etc, with govt helping a bit for a while, but that is about to run out)... and only in March/April 1.2 million of these 38 million ""formal"" jobs already disappeared (employers did not even want to go into this ""suspension"" program); it is expected that there will be an explosion in these figures when the temporary suspension program is over... anecdotes: Latam Brasil has already said that it will slash its workforce (it has 21,000 people here) after agreement with unions expires in June; small business like restaurants are starting to annouce that they will close ""for good""; it is really getting difficult not to be gloomy."
"As always, thank you. And yes, gloomy in every aspect..... thanks again so much for your thoughtful commentary. You often inform my Brazilian household as to what's really happening."

"This is perhaps due to frustration with the news media manipulating the data and feeding it to people who lack the ability to look beyond what is presented. Unfortunately, the data does not reflect the size of the population. Currently, Brazil has about 36,000 Covid deaths, which is indeed a high figure when you compare it to other countries. But then you have to consider that Brazil has a population of 209 million. If you combine the deaths for France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland you arrive at a similar pópulation total of 204 million, but a vastly higher figure of 88.000 for Covid deaths. A little more context goes a long way.Edited: 9:28 am, June 07, 2020 "
"Brian, indeed is always better to have a wider context to compare the data. But in order to achieve that, the official site should present a broader picture, not just daily totals and nothing else.The previous version detailed so much more data: you could see how different regions were evolving in many fields (death toll, cases total, new cases daily, new deaths daily, incidence by population, etc). My point being more information allows us for a better judgement of the real situation, regardless of political views.Edited: 12:13 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"I agree. This is a dick move by Bolsonario (of whom I am not a fan, by any measure). His reaction in denying access to information because he can't control the negative spin applied by the media is truly lamentable.

"Jorge: yes, that long, detailed Nytimes article.....Rokatoo: we are completely confused about what's happening in SP. Quarantines extended but malls and stores are open? Or not? Or yes? Is this all about valentine's day/dia namoradas?Edited: 6:43 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"@Greg #537yes, it can be confusing... you first have to sort out news for specific regions of state of SP... when you read ""SP"", it can mean the municipality (12 million), the metro area (21 million), or the entire state (46 million)... ""quarantine"" in state of SP (I avoid this term as it conjures up something that never really happened in Brazil; I prefer to use ""social distancing measures"") is now moving at different stages according to each area.... the criteria were decided some weeks ago - which gave rise to those color-coded areas of the state indicating at which stage each area is... and now these ""new phases"" are kicking in... subject to the approval of municipal-level authorities too,,,as far as MUNICIPALITY of SP proper... yes, street level stores were allowed to re-open today but for 4 hours only outside peak hours (which are considered 7-10am and 5-8pm); shopkeepers can choose when these 4 hours are... maybe that explains why when we went to supermarket this mid- afternoon we saw some stores (maybe 50%?) open; maybe others had chosen to open at other times and had already closed again;stores in shopping malls: starting tomorrow (June 11) they can open with limited hours; it is a 4-hour window too... 6-10 am (for small, local malls) or 4-8pm (larger malls)... and can take in only 20% of customers (food courts, movies etc remain closed)[car dealerships and real estate agents already opening too]as you can see, there is a lot of minutia; some of these staggered hours is to try to minimize crowding in public transportation... and these rules will keep changing in near future... less restrictions if no spike in cases; more restrictions again if numbers get worse...[does that make sense in health terms? we will see in 2 or 3 weeks... rationale presented (besides that small shops were all going almost bankrupt and employees losing jobs) is that in municipality of SP, the ""peak"" is behind, with data showing that new infections, daily deaths etc (on a rolling 7-day average, to smooth out daily fluctuations due to reporting quirks) have all been going down in city for about 10 days.... and that health system in municipality of SP can now absorb potential new cases...same rationale was applied elsewhere in state of SP, and street-level stores etc in some areas were ordered to close there as these areas are only now seeing a sharp increase in cases (the so-called ""interiorization"" of covid19 in Brazil)... that is why you have to be careful when reading ""SP"" in news... info must be region-specific][similar moves thruout Brazil; it gets too complex to describe what is going on in each place; some are opening up more; some are closing more, each with its own details etc etc... it is all local - and at times subject to local court injuctions saying one thing, then court injunction is overruled etc etc..as often said, Brazil is not for beginners...]"

"updates:- now that it has been about 3 months since Brazil had its first 200 confirmed cases (now getting close to one million...), CUMULATIVE data per state is losing some of its relevance - as the pandemic is moving at different speeds in the country (due to size of country, distances, the piecemeal implementation of social distancig measures etc etc);- data in post #569 already reflects some of that, as demand for ICU beds is shifting between states (and even WITHIN certain states; some of which are larger in area and/or population than many European countries, for example)... but ICU beds reflect the dynamics of 3-4 weeks ago, not what what is happening now (a more up-to-date piece of info is people showing up at public health clinics with initial symptoms, for example);- some examples of changing dynamics are in Mato Grosso, initially barely affected and now seing a surge in cases, demand for ICU beds etc... it is feared that it could become a ""new Amazonas""... incidentally, Manaus (Amazonas state capital), which was very hard hit weeks ago, is seeing ""excess deaths"" (total deaths for all causes compared to previous years) getting close to zero... in state of SP, decrease in confirmed deaths in city of SP is being offset by an increase elsewhere in the state (slightly more than half of population lives outisde the official metro area)... - so, while some places are relaxing social distancing measures (we will see what comes out of that in some weeks), others are making them stricter.. e,g, Cuiabá (capital of Mato Grosso) now has a nighttime curfew; Salvador restricted its popular beachfront promenade in Barra to area residents only; very large northern state of Pará (whose capital Belém was struck hard weeks ago but improving now) is seeing increases elsewhere and closing shops in certain areas; Curitiba (capital of Paraná) and its metro area are looking at more measures later this week"

"Are restaurants and bars in Rio open with restrictions? Is there a site with current info on business, tourist sites and beach re-openings? Obrigado"
"@RDJTI #589restaurants are scheduled to reopen on July 2 (many are open for delivery/takeout now). these are city hall rules.[note that some places have not survived the crisis and closed for good]beaches were crowded this weekend (an unusually hot day for beginning of winter...)... in theory, beaches were open only for physical activities, but that is far from what happened.dates for official re-opening can change often - especially in Rio where state governor and city mayor are often at loggerheads and issue conflicting directions (e.g. in mid June governor said restaurants could open,, then mayor said no...)... and then there are courts which (like everywhere in Brazil) can also issue injunctions reversing orders... yes, complicated to follow.best way to keep up is using google search in Portuguese to see latest Rio news from local news sources... [also note that real life compliance/enforcement varies a lot depending on neighborhood; more central, well-off established neighborhoods will see more of both (by no means in full effect either), while largely ignored in farther out, underpriviliged and more informal neighborhoods]tourist sites: best to check individual websites of places of interest... officially, they should all still be closed now...if you really want to track Rio city hall rules, you have to do 2 things:1. first look at this website which phase city is in:http://inteligencia.rio/planoretomadaat sort of upper right hand corner you will see a box "" Estamos na Fase X""... it is phase 2 now2. then cross reference to charts (pages 10 and beyond) which lay out details of who and how they can re-open in each phase... you need to download the ""Plano de Retomada"" PDF file:https://riocontraocorona.rio/downloads/"

I would stick to airlines that have kept some level of service to/from Brazil (e.g. from Europe: Lufthansa; Air France/KLM... from USA: United) for most of the time, while many others have completely canceled all flights to/from Brazil for months already...some airlines have announced a number of dates for resumption of service (and sold tkts...), just to have to cancel flights and push them back to later dates due to entry restrictions, demand levels etc... depending on your home country refund rules (and how that has been enforced), it may mean money getting stuck as airline credit vouchers (fyi - for purchases made in Brazil or subject to local laws, govt has allowed airlines to delay refunds up to 12 months AFTER the end of ""state of emergency"" - which is currently in effect till Dec. 31, 2020... so airlines can legally defer any cash refunds till end of next year...).this thread has some of these ongoing changes:https:/…106970777[this week, as Europe decides which travelers will be able to enter the continent (I would not hold my breath that Brazil would be on first batch due to pandemic levels here...), we could see more changes to flight service... if Brazilians (without dual citizenship and/or residency in Europe) are not allowed to enter Europe, the economics of many flights just do not make sense, as the demand gets limited to one side of the Atlantic only... that would likely have an impact on resumption and/or increase of flight frequency... ]finally, as intl flights have been curtailed, you may end up having to fly to Sao Paulo GRU (more flights than to Rio GIG) and then take a domestic flight.... while flights between SP and Rio never stopped, their frequency is still way lower than before... this thread has some comments about it:https:/…106979845"

"BBC News service in Portuguese published a story about current stage and evolution of pandemic in Brazil... below are rough google translations of some excerpts:""The average number of people who die from the new coronavirus per day in Brazil has remained relatively stable since the beginning of June. The so-called moving average of deaths by covid-19 has varied around 1,000...""""... The moving average gives a better idea of the evolution of the epidemic in Brazil than the figures released each day in the bulletins, because daily data fluctuates a lot, for a number of reasons ...""""... The moving average of covid-19 deaths in the country increased rapidly between mid-March and the end of May. But it has varied very little since then. The lowest index of that period was registered on June 2: 923 deaths. And the largest (1,057 deaths), on June 24. The most recent moving average of daily deaths, on July 14, was 1,049 deaths ...""""... That would be good news - because at least the rate has stopped growing exponentially - if the average death rate did not remain so high. ""It parked around 1,000. This means that the pandemic is still very aggressive, and, therefore, the total number of deaths is growing so much"" ...""""Two factors make the average number of deaths per day remain high in the country as a whole. The first is that the pandemic is at different stages in the states and in the Federal District."" ""In many, the average is also stable at a high level. This is the case of Amapá, Alagoas, Ceará, Espírito Santo, Maranhão, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, São Paulo and Bahia.The rate is falling in Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Roraima and Rio de Janeiro. But this reduction is offset by the growth of several other states, such as Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Rondônia, Santa Catarina, Tocantins and the Federal District ....""""At the same time, the coronavirus outbreak may be showing signs that it is cooling in many state capitals, but it is in full swing outside them. ""The epidemic in Brazil is not one big fire. There are several small bonfires. The big fires that we saw in state capitals have now given way to smaller bonfires in the main cities in the interior, which are surrounded by a lot of bonfires"" ...""""The moving average of new cases indicates that the situation may still get worse. Unlike deaths, which grew until May, the increase in cases continued until the beginning of July and seems to have stabilized in the past two weeks. But the daily moving average remains high: it varied between 37,000- 38,000 in these 15 days. And it probably hasn't given time yet for all of this to be reflected in the average of deaths""full article (in Portuguese):https://noticias.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias…"

I need to visit my mother urgent due to health issues and I am not sure if it is a wise decision since the news are overwhelming here in Europe. Doctors said to wait a few weeks but I think I must be there. I cannot find any further info apart from the usual data. Is it possible someone advise on real intel? There are flights and hotel open as far as I can see.
"@shirley #668if you are not a Brazilian citizen or resident but if your mother is a Brazilian citizen, then you are exempt from the current restrictions on entry of non-Brazil citizens and residents... the restrictions are discussed in posts #43, #45 and #53 in thread below:https:/…107295093[that thread talks about Americans, but it applies to any nationality; entry restrictions in Brazil at the moment are not based on nationality]yes, intl flghts to/from Brazil have never ceased completely (but limited to only those who were allowed to enter the country). for example, Lufthansa, Swiss, Air France, KLM are flying between Europe and Brazil at the moment.,,, most flights are to Sao Paulo GRU, but there are a few to Rio GIG airport too,you do not mention where in Brazil you would go, but if you need a connecting domestic flight to get there, there are flights available... but domestic schedule is still only at about 20% of previous network, so a connection may take longer to get than it used to... this thread has updates on domestic flight situation:https:/…107204361hotels: yes, there are hotels open in most places; again, not all have re-opened.whether it is a wise decision, that is a deeply personal decision... in terms of intel, I personally think that the article quoted in post #658 in this very thread (scroll back a few pages) gives a fairly accurate picture of what is going in the country right now (and it highlights the differences in areas of the country; that may help you decide one way or the other).all the best to you and your family."
"Thank you for the reply. I have both brazilian and spanish passports and I am posting in english perhaps to see if there is a similar case for any foreign citizen. I am going to Rio and I am currently in Athens, caught here in the beginning of the quarantine in europe and still it is not safe to go anywhere outside Greece, being the safest european country so far. After all the hardship we went through in the quarantine I have now to undergo another one in brazil, not fair. With the spanish passport it might be easier to leave the country afterwards."
"@shirley #670there is no ""quarantine"" after you enter Brazil... you will be free to roam around Rio once you get there... yes, there may be some restrictions on business hours for certain shops, restaurants etc, but not a full blown lockdown... there has never been a full lockdown in Rio (or the vast majority of Brazil, as a matter of fact).as you have a Brazilian passport, you will be allowed to board the flight to Brazil and enter the country without any issues.there are no restrictions to leave Brazil; there are restrictions to enter other countries - you will know those that apply to Greece better than us here in Brazil.if you decide to travel and as your destination is Rio, I would try to get on one of the flights that go straight from Europe to Rio GIG airport... though they are less frequent than to Sao Paulo GRU, they do exist. e.g. for the Air France/KLM group: between Europe and Rio GIG:AF: now 3x/week; increase to 4x/week on Sept 7; then to 5x/week on Oct 5KLM: now 4x/weekgood luck in your decision and eventual travels."

It is like going to a war zone and I never thought I would live to see that, even though I work with conflict/war. The aftermath of the quarantine is not easy to live either, Athens is empty of tourists, main local economical resource, and in dire need of a strong economical directive.

No test = no cases.And than you have to have a look at the trend. Europe was hit very much in March/April. That time nobody knew a lot about this Virusa and so the countries were overrun. But Europe only has a few cases in the last 4 or more weeks. The the trend clearly goes downwards. But for Brazil the trend goes very fast and steep upwarts.

I am supposed to be going to Rio de Janero in September but I have heard that it is bad there and I don't think that I want to go this year is everything closed or open and how is the situation over there
"Pauline H,Brazil as a whole is transiting the COVID19 quite badly as most southamerican countries, with no clear sight of a downward trend as of yet. But daily cases and deaths are sort of stable in the last week.However, the situation has overall improved quite a lot in Rio de Janeiro (compared to a month ago), and there is gradual phased reopening plan.To me, September seems to soon but others will surely disagree. I'd follow the official information to see who and how one is allowed inside the country, and what's the sanitarian situation at the moment your intended travel will take place.The ""new normal"" for tourism in Rio would be achieved in Phase 6 (each phase is supposed to last 15 days, and the first one started in June 2nd)https:/…83o-Atualizado-17_07.pdf"

"I think Brazil may be trying to copy U.S. with “reopening,” which I can tell you as someone living in Texas is not a good idea. We are in the thick of it here, after reopening, Memorial Day, protests and 4th of July. The problem with these plans for reopening is people will act like things are back to normal. There is a saying in Portuguese: something about you give your hand, they’ll take your arm. Reopening is a good idea in theory, but carrying it out and people following the rules is another matter. I watched Dr. Fauci on a live interview on Instagram yesterday and everyone here wants to know about kids going back to school. He spoke about “diversity of infection.” I think that is such an important factor in how everyone proceeds with reopening. I personally don’t think Rio is in a place to reopen. I also don’t think we are, here in Texas. We have and look what’s happened. We are basically “staying home” without an official stay at home order. Our President is making comparisons to European countries and using them as examples for going back to school. The mistake is that we are at a different phase in this virus. Brazil is at a different phase too. I wish Brazil could step back and learn from the mistakes the U.S. makes instead of trying to copy us. We are going to be dealing with this for a long time."
"Mojomo, I agree with you in all your points. Every country is in a different situation right now.I wish there could be a main plan of reopening and that people would follow rules and instructions.However, we also see the same problems here in Argentina.Without a proper treatment and vaccination, the reopening has to be carefully done."

Is it 100% for sure that a negative COVID test and doctor's letter are no longer required? I saw a Folha online article that stated a negative test and health insurance were required. The decree doesn't mention it but Folha is a major news source and not prone to making errors like that. Has any foreigner on this board actually entered yet?

British Airways have cancelled my international travel. I have covid insurance but FCO advising against travel, so the insurance would be invalid. Fortunately hotels in Brazil and my private guide in the Pantanal have been fantastic and agreed to rebook me for next year without losing my money. Thank you to Canzi Cataratas hotel, Merlin Copacabana hotel and the lovely Rizardo at Silva Tour Pantanal. Hopefully 2021 will be better for all of us."
