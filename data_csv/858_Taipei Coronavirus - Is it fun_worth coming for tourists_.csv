I have a trip to Taipei next week (March 1). I’m trying figure out if it’s still worth coming as a tourist? Is normal life still happening? Food stalls open? Does it look like a ghost town? Would you cancel if you were me? Any locals with advice on this would be much appreciated.
There's been numerous other posts on this. It's business as usual but with more people wearing masks.
"I think you can follow your plan, not a big deal : )BUT, when you visit a place with more people, like on the train, some landmarks, museums...and so on, please wearing a mask.I think that can protect you, also others."
Kind of trip? If you can delay it then delay it. It's really quiet and boring but actually Taiwan is very safe and controlling the situation.
"Masks are not necessary. Most locals are wearing them but they are fairly useless. If you don't have a mask, don't worry. Most foreigners I know don't wear them."
"Enjoy your trip to Taipei. All business as usual and worth visiting, except you’ll find many locals wearing masks that are fairly useless against covid-19, but hey - whatever make them feel a false sense of protection even without scientific basis - good for them. Just be aware, if Covid-19 gets worse in Taiwan or if the country you are returning to considers Taiwan a part of China, you might risk being quarantined when you return."
