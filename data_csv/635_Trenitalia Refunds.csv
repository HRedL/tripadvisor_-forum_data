">>I have waited well over 3 months for refunds on four cancelled train journeys?<<This topic has been discussed in several different threads....a quick search and you would have found the answer.It appears most people have received their refund vouchers, although not all received the email indicating that the refund claim was processed. I would guess that is not the fault of Trenitalia and rather your email provider blocked the email from reaching your inbox. Over the last 5 years, almost all email providers have been much more aggressive in blocking emails that they deem as fraud. Unfortunately, it sometimes blocks emails that you want to receive. Use the below Trenitalia webpage to see if your refund claim has been processed and if it is ready to be claimed. Enter the email address that you used to purchase the tickets and the PNR number. If your claim has been processed, there should be a button near the bottom of the page to claim your refund. https:/…cerca_e_modificailbiglietto.htmlEdited: 6:14 am, July 23, 2020 "

If you filed a COVID-19 refund claim, you will receive a cash refund for regional train tickets and a voucher for fast train tickets. If you received a voucher and are not planning on traveling to Italy in the near future - do you know of any friends or family members that might be making a trip? You can purchase train tickets for others although be aware that the traveler's name is required to be on the ticket (and must match how it is displayed on their passport) in case of the need of contact tracing."
>> I asked for cash refunds before they changed their policy on 5 March.<<The COVID-19 refund policy had always been cash refunds for regional trains and a voucher for fast trains. See the first post in the below thread for the original COVID-19 refund policy issued in February. Unless you are stating that you attempted to submit a normal non-COVID-19 refund claim.https:/…105696867
"Those two types of trains are 'fast' trains, not regional ones."
"You can only file a normal refund request if you purchased the full fare ticket option called the Base fare ticket. If you purchased the discounted Economy or Super Economy tickets, it is not available. There is also a cancellation penalty of 20%. More recently, I have seen comments that the train companies are following their COVID-19 refund policies and not their normal refund policies. However, I recall a few people who successfully submitted a claim via the normal refund policy and received a cash refund relatively early in the pandemic. I don't remember if they were traveling on Trenitalia or Italo, however."
