"I am supposed to be in aspen on wed for 5 days before moving to Estes park for 5 days. I am assuming aspen isn’t going to Happen due to the fires.... where would you suggest I visit instead for those first 5 days? We enjoy biking, hiking, etc.... Thanks!Philip"
"Stay home. My wife is out there now due to a medical emergency, and she said it was smoky from Denver to Grand Junction. That and COVID make it downright dangerous to visit.Edited: 8:21 am, August 17, 2020 "
"I would probably head south to maybe Colorado Springs or Pagosa Springs.Edited: 8:37 am, August 17, 2020 "
"Given that the fires are in western Colorado and typical flow is generally towards the east, that is going to blanket much of Colorado. Here's a fascinating NOAA mapping tool that allows you to view different smoke-related overlays. Do note that smoke from wildfires is very dynamic. It might be good one day and be back the next just with changes in flow and jet stream. The fire situation is also not going to resolve in the next few days.https://hwp-viz.gsd.esrl.noaa.gov/smoke/#You could come over here to Park City, Utah instead. It's clear. But given the already existing challenges of COVID, huge pressure on the outdoors for all the same things you're seeking, maybe staying home is the best solution. Have fun."
"Smoke is moving around a lot. Was clear in Glenwood last night. Terrible this morning. Buena vista to the south was smoky too. Colorado springs had a light haze yesterday. South is better, but because 70 is shut roads are very busy as detours. Estes park could be smoky too with the 2 more northern fires. I probably would cancel."
"You probably are not going to experience CO at its best. Hot, dry, smoky, crowded, covid restrictions, etc. Please reconsider the trip. Thanks."
Do you think it could get better by Sep 5th to 10th? We were planning to visit CO during that weekend.
More of the roads might be open by then but my guess is that the fires will keep burning until it starts snowing so smoke will likely still be an issue in September. Honestly no one knows at this point. It's so dry that new fires are starting every day.
"There are updates herehttps:/…You will see that many of the fires are at 0% Containment. Containment is just that contained, not out, big difference.Agree with 618keith. It's a long way from over.Edited: 10:35 am, August 17, 2020 "
Fire management leaders are saying they won't probably be out until we get lots of rain or snow. Fire is burning under the bark of the trees so hot spots will continue to smolder even when there are no flames. Won't take much for a fire to flare again. 3 or so weeks won't make a dent in these massive fires. CA is getting the news coverage due to the proximity to homes I guess but the fires here are massive.
Thanks for the info everyone
"If you are in NY, that implies you were going to fly to/from Co just to go hiking and biking? During a pandemic? really? I don't understand this at all because can do that in NY, there are plenty of mountains and lake areas up north. If that isn't exciting enough, you could go to Pennsylvania, WV, or even the Smokey Mtns or Shenandoah Valley. YOu can drive to all those places. I know VT and ME won't let you in, not sure about NH. But really if all you want to do is hiking and biking, there isn't any need for this trip so far.I know the east doesn't have as high mountains, but you can do what you want back east. The Smokies are great."
"ChristinaW -I live in NYS.NYers are allowed in Maine. They are also allowed in VT if their county numbers are below VTs acceptable threshold.Edited: 7:16 pm, August 17, 2020 "
"You don't need to justify or explain to the travel police ""Christina"" why you're going anywhere!! After a rude comment on my post...I've noticed she has too much time on her hands and spends a lot of it criticizing instead of offering the advice people are asking for! You do you and enjoy!"
Yay another Covid19 denier.
"I am not traveling to Maine or VT; just correcting misinformation. But I don't think all people who are traveling are ""COVID deniers"" and such labels aren't going to make the situation better.Edited: 9:20 pm, August 19, 2020 "

Apparently the rules don’t apply to some posters.
"Phillip, the whole state is impacted due to the smoke from CA and our own fires. It's extremely hot, dry and visibility is not good. Here is a link to the air quality map for the state - I'll let you decide where you feel comfortable hiking and biking and breathing. https:/…1533766244123-10bd73f7-c27e"
