Cat we had the same experience coming and going. Got home last night. Had a great time!!
You must have used Mike for your transfer. I was chatting with him this morning and he said he had a transfer client coming in from Newark. How bumpy was the landing? LOL
"Yes, I used Mike Fisher DWJ VIP Services. I was that client, lol. For it to be a tropical storm, it was a great flight. The United pilots did a fantastic job! There were a few bumps here and there on the flight, but most of all smooth. It was a good landing despite of the wind.My brothers' flight from Charlotte on American had to turn the plane around today. They were due to arrive at 1:30pm. They were just told now that their flight is leaving tomorrow."
You got there safe... the most important thing.Enjoy!
"Awesome! Have a wonderful time Cat. If you have a chance give us a scoop on how things are at your resort.I will be arriving on Monday with my wife and our 17 year old daughter for a week of fun & sun in punta cana and can't wait. We will be staying @ Ocean Blue & Sand. Our airport transfers are also set up with Punta Cana Mike and our flights are through United. Other than the ""bumps"" you describe we hope to replicate the experience you so describe in your post..Have a wonderful time!Thanks!"
"Mr Lee,Mike Fisher and Punta Cana Mike are two different people, with two separate companies.Mark"
"Thanks for the clarification Mark. I don't know why I assumed that.. My apologies to all..Either way, I am expecting a smooth situation upon our arrival and look forward to a nice relaxing week.Thanks Mark!Edited: 3:54 pm, July 30, 2020 "
Why does this thread no longer appear on the forum?Mark
"Hey Mark.Yeah they closed the topic. I have no idea why, so I had them reinstate it. I see it's no longer on the forum as well...Gotta let TA know, smh. I think with everything happening with trolls messing up the DR forum, TA is being somewhat too proactive in cleaning topics... But unfortunately, the bad ones are still getting through while the helpful ones are being deleted"
"Hey Cat. Hope you are having a great trip. Will be enjoying your pics as missing that beach big time. As for your thread, now that it has been reinstated, it should re-appear on the forum shortly. Same thing happened to a couple of my ""Live From"" threads previously."
Good to see the thread is back up and showing on the forum.Angie.
"Hope you have a great trip, have fun and stay safe. I found out today that my resort opened up today so can cross that concern off the list. Still not in travel mode yet but I leave in 4 weeks."
"Hi Cat, have a great trip and keep us updated as and when you can."
"Enjoy every moment, who knows what's to come as far as travel is concerned. Wishing you a fabulous holiday."
"HI Cat SGlad to hear you made it safely and are having a good time. Is SCC your only vacation spot in Punta Cana, or will you be switching to another resort like when you visited Cancun? Continue to enjoy. Fingers crossed that EEC opens in August. We are scheduled to be there in Sept. We have not received any emails yet stating our reservation is cancelled, so hoping no news is good news.Hi MHeath1964,Thanks for the clarification on Punta Cana Mike versus Mike Fisher. I used Punta Cana Mike in February thinking they were one in the same."

Cat....So glad your arrival went safely. Enjoy your relaxation!What's up with this topic?
I was wondering the same thing Prize!
Do you know what kind of beer they have besides presidente?
Are u staying preferred as wondering if the preferred lounge is open? Any music outside at nite for entertainment and dancing? Where are u getting a late nite snack as I read 24 hour room service is t available after 11pm
"Ok, let's try this one. Glad you arrived safely Cat! TY for letting us know. Enjoy your trip!BTW, how is the sargassum? Hopefully, there is none."

"""What's up with this topic?""Wow, I just became aware this thread has been reinstated and was wondering the above myself several times. Cat, sounds like you are having a great time @ Cap Cana! Enjoy!So, yesterday I received the news Ocean Blue & Sand will not be re-opening until 10/1 and was offered to re-book our vacation to October or later. I immediately decided to preserve our vacation and will still be flying down with United on Monday. We are now booked for 7 nights stay @ Dreams Macao. This hotel had its Grand Opening in March (subsequently shut down a couple weeks later due to Covid19) and recently resumed its operation sometime in July. Based on my best understanding, the hotel is operating at limited capacity with regard to its facilities, amenities and overall transitional period for a ""brand new"" resort..Either way, we remain excited about our trip and wonder:1. Cat, on your United flight, were any passengers allowed the freedom to find empty seats/area for social distancing purposes?2. In light of limited amenities, would it make sense for me to entertain paying extra for enhanced guest status (our hotel offers ""Ultra Luxury"" for usual stuff) Any input from our community here will be appreciated.Thanks!"

"Yes, I'm staying in the Preferred section. The Preferred lounge is closed. Coco's Cafe is open 24 hrs for late night snacks and bites.The ocean is sparkling and beautiful right now. SCC staff has been out on the beach by 6:30, 7 am cleaning the sargassum. The tractors are out here too. They have been doing a great job. The sargassum isn't too bad today - it's better than yesterday."
I saw pics on Facebook of the beach and since there was just a storm it looked pretty clear considering. Could easily clear up completely overnight. What is the occupancy?
"So Cat, you've been there a few days, how are things going? We all enjoy your updates/reports whilst you are at the resort and you've been quiet now a day or 2."
Hope you're having a great time Cat :-)
Pain of having a Live thread is dealing with trolls. Never stopped me but some may find it annoying.
"Yep understand that Sly, seen whats been going on."
"Cat, So glad you had a great time. TY for the updates. ""Live froms"" and even ""Semi Live Froms"" are incredibly helpful in this world of Covid travel. Thanks too for the info re VIP service. We pare considering it.Thanks again!"
"No problem Prize!I'm currently on my 3rd day of self-quarantine here in NYC. I don't have to quarantine, but I want to be a safer/responsible traveler. I'm going to take a COVID-19 PCR test on Wed, so I don't have to quarantine for the full 14 days hopefully. I do like that the DR has implemented some type of filtering with COVID-19 testing with incoming tourists. Of course, this isn't 100% - but it is a filter."
Hi cat. What is the pcr and how does one obtain? Sorry if this maybe was answered before
"Hi AH,Without getting overly technical, PCR in regards to a COVID-19 test stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction. This lab technique is done through a nasal swab or throat swab collected from saliva/fluid. The PCR test detects genetic material of the COVID-19 virus. This is the most accurate COVID-19 test out there currently. So at the DR airports, you have to show a negative COVID-19 test result from within 5 days of your arrival. If you don't have one, you will take a rapid COVID-19 test in which they will prick your finger for blood. This isn't as accurate as a PCR test. You are in a different country, so I don't know how testing protocols work for you. Here in NYC, we can get a COVID-19 PCR test by going into an Urgent Care test site or having your primary care physician order one. The govt of NYC has also set up testing sites at some city hospitals to help with this. I went with my primary care physician."
A HWhen sre you expecting to fly to the DR ?Angie.
Awesome im just in Pennsylvania lol thanks so much I've been doing my research wasn't sure if I would be able to use the one from urgent care
soon hopefully within the next 2 weeks
"Oh, I'm sorry about that AH. I assumed you were from Warminster in the U.K. I didn't know there was one in the U.S. as well. Yes, the urgent care facilities should/will have the PCR tests. You might also be able to get a rapid PCR test depending on where you live. These are hard to find, but if you are able to get one, it is worth it. You can get your results within the hour vs the 3 - 7 day turnaround time for the regular PCR test."
