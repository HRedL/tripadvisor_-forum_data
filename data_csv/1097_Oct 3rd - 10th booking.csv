hiwe got this week booked with jet2 - does anyone know if things will still be open due to covid-19 and what weather generally like.
Tricky one. Around that time places start to close as season drops off very quickly and that's in a normal season so who knows what will be open then. My friends on the island have said very little is open at moment so I guess it's just basic shops open.
It maybe that things will be different this year as its not the normal season at all. Really its a case of wait and see as people are shifting bookings into October as the early summer flights are cancelled so October may well be viable if businesses decide to remain open further into the month.
