I am planning to visit ziro valley on 14 april. I will land in Lilabari airport at around 1pm. Will i get a shared cab to ziro at 1pm and after after reaching ziro will it be possible to book a car for local sight seeing?
"Not sure if you will find shared taxis at the airport, but will definitely get shared sumos to Ziro in Lakhimpur town.Yes, you will find local taxis for hire at Hapoli town in Ziro."
I couldn't find any flights operating from kolkata to lilabati. Can you please tell me how did you find the flights to lilabari?
"Air India, departure Kolkata 14:15, arrival Lilabari 16:25Operates on alternate days"
Thank you so much. Actually I was looking for the month of February and couldn't find any flights
I don't 2021 Feb flight schedule would be available now.Current flight schedules have been also changed due to Covid-19 lockdown.
