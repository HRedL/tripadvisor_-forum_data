"Unfortunately, Fiji is not immune from the virus. The first case has been confirmed in someone who has returned to Lautoka from overseas. The Prime Minister will be making an announcement shortly.https://fijivillage.com/ I guess it was inevitable, but hopefully Fiji will be able to contain it."
Yes it was going to happen especially as they can still travel to NZ without having to self isolate for 14 days.
"Here is the NZ link to the news story that appear on tonight news:https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/â€¦and as of 11.59pm tonight, NZ has a border ban on all non New Zealand citizens and residents entering the country"
Great to see Nd and Australia are closing their borders but unfortunately many are still arriving home from countries affected so there could be more before it levels off.
Covid-19 in Fiji has now risen to 15 but all are currently in isolation
Best hopes and wishes to the citizens of Fiji for a good outcome. Does anyone know the latest number of cases of Covid-19 in Fiji and how the trends appear?
Friji has had 18 cases of Covid 19 with 12 recovered and no deaths.There has been ZERO cases in Fiji since 21st April so the trend is looking very positive.
Very nice to hear! Thanks for the update.
Fijian friends report they are now able to leave their homes as lock down has bee n lifted. They managed the crisis well.
You are welcome YukonJack15 .Hope you get a chance to visit this wonderful country in the not to distant future.I would probably look at 2021.
Hoping to get back this year for annual Christmas trip if not sooner.
"I am booked for late October .Still Hoping for the ""Pacific Bubble"" to eventuate."
"Thanks Greytraveller! We were originally planning our first trip to Fiji for either Nov-Dec or Jan-Feb, but never got around to booking anything when the virus hit the fan. But American is offering some flexible rules on new tickets purchased by the end of May, so I might be pulling the trigger before then."
make sure you purchase something that is fully refundable if you book early.
