"For non-nationals visiting the country:A negative COVID-19 test from place of origin, maximum of 72 hours before travel. This must be a PCR test (not an antibody test). Travel insurance is required."
"Someone please explain to me, how does travel insurance help. What does it mean and what does it do with reference to the Covid virus. I understand the concept of travel insurance for hurricanes etc... Thanks for the help.Edited: 12:36 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"Also immigration reserves right to random checking, and temperatures check. Most states take 3-5 days for test results, don’t know how that will workBorders definitely open July 22Developing a portal tracer by mid aug , not real time but can refer back if someone tests positiveI don’t understand how the insurance thing is going to work, persons coming in August it will be too late for travel insurance, especially when the cause is already know. They didn’t clarify what type of travel insurance to get (there are many)And people booked for August might not have access to rapid tests, so they’ll cancel anyway (but who pays?)Edited: 12:41 pm, June 25, 2020 "
I bet it will change many times as they start to open up.
"On Instagram, ""Turksdigest"" page has interesting info regarding this"
"I think it's a specific type of insurance that's paid to the TCI government, not regular travel insurance. Aruba implemented something similar, which is $15 per person, per day up to 14 days (I think). It covers the cost of quarantining in the event a person gets sick during their trip. I'm not sure if it covers medical costs.Allegedly, there will be a portal where one can upload test results and,I imagine, purchase the insurance."
Truly unfortunate that she’s opening up the borders so soon.
"So soon? Just curious... What would you do, and how would you pay for it? There are a lot of hungry people in that country that are either burning through any savings they have or are going without. ""She"" can't start printing money to hand out like the good old USA can.Edited: 1:58 pm, June 25, 2020 "
Does anyone know if you have to self quarantine for 14 days upon arrival if you're coming from the United States?
"hope, no"
Booked for arrival on July 22nd. Thinking getting a test result in 72hrs is going to be problematic. Bahamas are giving arrivals a 10 day window for test results before arrival. T & C needs to address this soon.
"Not to mention the portal not going live till August, what does that mean?"
"Arriving July 24 impossible to get a Test in NJ within 72 hours it’s a roll of the dice . I have called every where . 10 days before travel is more realistic .Edited: 3:51 pm, June 25, 2020 "
They block all US residents as they are high risk
Have you been drinking again Dave?
It does seem a bit weird. TCI is setting the bar so high that is discouraging tourists by thinking they could not meet the criteria or making them think it is not worth the effort. Wrap it in red tape rather then extending the block.
Good luck trying to get travel insurance. I’m sure things will continue to change as time goes on.
"What is everyone’s problem. Use common sense!!! It is going to be very difficult to travel, Those on this forum who advertise their properties be it a resort or an AirnB,; not happening in the near future. Sorry. Most of us love Provo but ... maybe 2021 is better. Use your mind making reservations that might not occur.Bottom line, unless you have a private jet, be weary where you place down a deposit for the next six months..Edited: 5:06 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"Tewksnc: You have been on this forum for years and apparently know T&C. Do not know how you travel. Why don’t you ask your travel agent or your credit card company about travel insurance and then share with the forum.On another note, everyone remember, booking thru a third party (trip advisor, Expedia,etc.), they charge an additional ,10-15%. O.k. Ask them.Everyone, have questions, call the premiere since most on this forum own a condo or property. For those who do not, call the resorts for answers. Everyone on this forum are not CEOs/ property resort mgrs. on Provo. Take time and meet some if interested ..l helps with opining..Edited: 5:20 pm, June 25, 2020 "
Sounds like it would be easier to get to Provo by catching a 30ft wooden sloop out of Haiti then a private jet from the US.
"So if they reopen under the condition that travelers have (negative) test results, but a test cannot be obtained, is it traveler’s loss?"
"This is great news! So only a negative Covid PCR Test (not an antibody test) is required 72 hours before departure along with health insurance. Are these the only requirements? I currently have a trip to Bermuda booked for August ,but the requirements are a handful, adding too much stress. Now I need to rebook: its either Turks, Aruba, or St.Martin...decisions decisions. Bermuda requires a Negative Covid PCR test 72hrs prior to departure, then requires another Covid PCR test once you arrive, then off to your accommodation. While waiting for the results you have to stay at your accommodation (results back anywhere from 8-24hrs). You have to log your temperature twice a day online. Told to bring a thermometer with you to the island. On Day 3 & day 7 you have to be tested again. All while a government health officer is checking in with you..you have to stay in touch via email or telephone.Edited: 5:30 pm, June 25, 2020 "
Travel insurance is required to include health cover. You can get it to cover Covid. Otherwise face a large bill on island.
"mjb / hope: why ask here? The govt. controls things, no one does on this forum. Ask your health providers or travel insurance providers. If you would like, share with the forum. These questions and answers are fluid. Please state the travel insurance provider.Always remember, healthcare is not the best in the Caribbean and not free.Edited: 5:54 pm, June 25, 2020 "
"The insurance mandated is Travel Medical Insurance, not to be confused with regular travel insurance.You can get TMI at any time, from many insurance companies, even some credit cards offer it, or you can call your regular health insurance company and add on the travel health insurance.What TMI does (not to confuse with travel insurance again please) is if you get sick IN TCI, this insurance covers hospital, ambulance, quarintine, sometimes evacuation.It does not cover what you've paid on your vacation in any form, including place you're staying, loss vacation time, cancel vacation, etc.So it's easy to get at any time, and only covers expenses of getting sick. It's a way of saying TCI is not going to pay your hospital, quarintine, or evacuation if you get sick there."
"#27 Thank you for actual, relevant and valuable information. Meanwhile let's all just sit back and see how long it takes for this topic to go sideways."
"Hopefully Turks and Caicos will adopt a travel insurance like Aruba has. Everyone will be covered, no questions. It may cost a little bit more money but I don’t care."
I hope they just let you buy it on the open market. I found one for about $25 a week for two people vs the rumored $30/day for the Aruba scheme. Looking forward to the details.
"Okay, I’m so confused. Do most people not have travel medical insurance automatically through their company benefit packages. We’ve always been covered, including medical evacuations. What we never do is buy cancellation insurance."
"I cannot comment on health insurance in the US. For travellers from Europe, insurance is mandatory if buying an overseas package holiday. Retired people will also need to check on insurance. Almost all travel insurance has a number of days maximum cover. This is related to the age of the person and other factors. 30 days is typical although some bank accounts ( I am talking NOT the US here), will cover up to 90 days. I found in March trying to buy a worldwide travel policy that the number of days has reduced, so what is true now many not be what was there last time you bought a policy. I did find a specialist annual worldwide insurance at 1700GBP for more than 90 days cover. Is this a lot? I dont think so as it is the equivalent of a premium class ticket to and from London. So rather than have to return to my home country every 30 days which would be the situation with a standard policy, I can stay outside the UK as long as I need to. Bottom line: check insurance cover and look at the extent of cover and number of days carefully, as things may have changed."
"new info... Travel insurance will be required, which includes emergency assistance and COVID-19 medical repatriation. Further details are being finalized."
I wonder how difficult it will be to find a company that will cover COVID 19?
This company has it.https://www.sevencorners.com/#start
"Yes it does, Dr. Jim. They have a specific ""travelers plus"" plan that is meant to be Coronavirus coverage and covers everything including flights back to US for treatment of necessary."
"Here’s what is on their website.Travel Insurance for CoronavirusCOVID-19 has changed our lives and the way we travel.In response, we created new plans — Liaison Travel Plus, Liaison Student Plus, and Wander Frequent Traveler Plus — same great travel medical insurance, now with specially designed COVID-19 coverage.The COVID-19 benefit covers medical expenses for:COVID-19 (the disease);SARS-Cov-2 (the virus); andAny mutation or variation of SARS-CoV-2.Each plan also includes Emergency Medical Evacuation and Repatriation, Emergency Medical Reunion, Return of Children, Return of Mortal Remains, and Local Burial or Cremation if you contract COVID-19. Other accidents and illnesses are covered as well."
"I traveled to South Korea during the MERS outbreak. For some time, many places in Seoul were closed and international arrivals dropped dramatically. Once the SK Government felt that the situation was ""somewhat"" under control, the South Korean Government itself provided travelers with Medical Insurance to cover MERS related illnesses (and deaths).A contemporaneous post on TA is found here:https:/…67271875I know that the TCI Government does not have the financial resources to provide Health Insurance to all arriving visitors, but, the above shows that there is some precedent for Governments themselves arranging/coordinating insurance coverage. Maybe, when it's appropriate, and I am not sure July 22nd is that day, the TCI Government can broker COVID-19 coverage for visitors to the Islands? Insurance is only one issue. The contagious and dangerous nature of this virus makes it very hard to contain once it's introduced in to a population. Stay and travel safe!"
Sorry to hear that it is only possible for the TCI government to take responsibility for insurance cover.
"Unless someone out there knows of a Canadian insurance company that will cover COVID-19 in their policies, this will preclude any Canadians from going to T&C."
"I have used this company for the last 10 years but I live in Provo. It is a US company but seems to have short term worldwide travel medical. Worth a call I guess but be sitting down when you get a quote. https:/…Medical attention in TCI is much cheaper than US or Canada but you really want to be air lifted out if you are really sick.Edited: 6:28 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"mel2007Toronto...I agree. Have yet to find any company that will insure Covid. So disappointed. I am hoping the policies re: insurance and testing, change but we are thinking we will have to cancel. There is just no way we can meet these requirements. It is a shame because we have been doing so well in Canada with our numbers, thank goodness."
"Mel....I think and assume when Canada finally lifts the ‘non essential travel ban” then insurance companies will include Covid coverage. However, it might be some time before that happens with the major increase of Covid in the US."
Maca: In our dreams ... being funny. I still need to go to Canada but cannot.
