Sorry - been out of commission for a week due to a different virus issue that landed me in hospital...In a nutshell - all tourism to Greenland has been suspended until mid-April at the earliest. Air Iceland Connect stops flying today (18th March) and Air Greenland are only operating their Copenhagen - Kangerlussuaq route for nationals and residents.

"Latest news ...After 18 days with no new cases of coronavirus, Greenland is set to reopen internally from this weekend.However, all international travel (including from Denmark) is prohibited until Jun 1 at the earliest."
"That's helpful. I was originally due to fly to Greenland on 20 May 2020, but Air Greenland's emails have been vague as to whether flights from Copenhagen to Greenland are international (it's a four-hour flight across the Atlantic) or domestic (Greenland is technically part of Denmark).However the website is explicit that flights between Denmark and Greenland are kaput until 31 May, and will be automatically refunded. Intra-Greenland domestic flights recommence on 25 April 2020. I also learn from the media that there are a handful of essential flights between Nuuk and Copenhagen with Air Greenland's Dash-8 turboprops, which takes eight hours.On the positive side the fluctuating exchange rate between DKK and GBP means that I've made a paper profit of £15, but I would rather go to Greenland instead and spend my money there.Edited: 3:03 pm, April 23, 2020 "
"Yep - you have it correct. My suggestion - postpone your travel if you can (even for next year) rather than cancel it. The tourism companies in Greenland are doing it very, very tough at the minute and if everyone keeps canceling - well quite a few of the operators will not be around when all this is over to help you explore this amazing country.Every situation is different - but if you can - postpone don't cancel.Hope to see you here later this year or next year!"
"My understanding is that the hiking season runs from late May to mid-October - I picked May because there are apparently fewer flying midges and the ground is still hard. Also the light is nicer. From October to May the temperature plummets to a point where I wouldn't be confident hiking, so I'll probably try to postpone my trip until late September.The complicating factor is that the conditions in the UK, Denmark, and Greenland all have to align - if any one of those countries has a second outbreak and goes into total lockdown I won't be able to go (again).Another factor is the ferry that sails up the west coast of Greenland. My original plan was to hike the arctic circle trail from Kangerlussaq to Sisimiut, then take the Saturday ferry up to Ilulissat, then fly back to Kangerlussaq. Hopefully the ferry will continue to run. It must be difficult to get around Greenland without air travel."
"September is actually a really beautiful time to hike in Greenland. The autumn (fall) colours are incredible and the mosquitoes/flies are gone. It is a little colder - for sure! But if you have the appropriate clothing and gear, it is still not too bad. The light is amazing at this time of year also and there is the possibility of catching the Northern Lights as a bonus. I wouldn't be worried about postponing until September. The Sarfaq Ittuk Ferry still runs at this time of year.Agree that it is almost impossible to predict what will happen internationally. And the fact that you have to travel through 3 countries doesn't help. If you are coming through Denmark - Greenland's border controls largely follow what the Danes do ... at least they have up until now. The government hasn't yet released information about how they plan to start opening up the country to international visitors - but I expect we'll have more information at the end of May.My understanding is that the ferry is due to run again soon. The internal travel restrictions within Greenland were lifted this past weekend, and it is sitting in the port here in Nuuk. So I suspect they will start sailing this week.Stay tuned. Hopefully more information coming in the next few weeks...We are also curious to see how they will start opening up again."
"Hi all, need some advice here. If Lisa and GLKLLCIO recall, I have (with their helpful comments on TA) booked a trip for two to Greenland in the second last week of June. I will have to fly through Copenhagen. It's cutting very close to the tentative 1 June ban on all international visitors, but the agency is insisting that Air Greenland is still intending to fly in June, and if I cancel now, I will forfeit the deposit I have paid (which is a substantial amount). I will try and ask to postpone the trip - does anybody know the rebooking policy for Air Greenland? I do not want a situation whereby the agency tells me that it is not possible to change the dates.If I am able to postpone but am forced to pick a later date this year, will August / September be fine? Currently, my itinerary involves Kangerlussuaq (4WD tour); Ilulissat (day tour to Ilimanaq, day tour to Eqi Glacier, midnight sun sailing among icebergs, Sermermiut Settlement hike); and Qeqertarsuaq (2 nights). Will it make any difference in terms of scenery/wildlife etc. if we went in August or September instead? I also wouldn't want the temperature to go too low (that's why we picked summer)."

"I recently postponed my late August visit exactly a year. The tour deposit transferred to the new dates, the trip insurance provided a voucher, and I am awaiting the voucher from Iceland Air. Will it still happen a year from now? I have no idea, but at least it doesn't feel like outright losing the money- yet!  I never thought, in late February, this would become a global crisis. That was barely 2 months ago.To try and make predictions for a year from now seems a form of denial with which I am wrestling, too, and not very successfully.. I think we need to brace and prepare for the new normal for a few years.  Aside from logistical complications ( borders, flare- ups of cases, businesses failing, and etc) you have to consider your and your travel partner's) health risks- dependent on fellow plane and ship passengers taking precautions, and whether they are asymptomatic, but with whom have THEY had contact along the way...right now I just want to be able to drive 6 hours to a neighboring state and hold my grandchild."
"Jellybellymelly, I would wait for a while. I doubt you'll be able to get in this year if you don't have to quarantine in Denmark and again in GL potentially if the flight schedules aren't messed up. Can you go next year? It just seems too tenuous at the moment. Which vendors are you dealing with?Here is the Air Greenland info as it relates to Covid. They allow cancellation if it was impacted by this.https:/…covid-19"
"Onerainyday, it's too early to call. Right now the Olympics are still on for next year. If you need to reschedule another year out (2022) sometime in 2021, then so be it. Might want to get that in writing from the tour company and airlines if it comes down to it. I'd insist but that's something you'll need to look at around this time next year. I'd keep the end of August. That's a perfect time to go and my favorite - might get some northern lights depending on where you visit and if you're lucky.Nothing we can do about it now. I'm grateful that you're helping people out by not cancelling. Please know that it will be worth it whenever you are able to visit. But be vigilant about demanding another rebooking free of charge if you cannot reasonably visit without quarantining in various places during your journey."
"Yes, I have actually contacted the tour agency to postpone the trip to 2021, and have not received a reply so far. I have booked with Topas Travel. My Air Greenland flights have been booked through the agency, so I wouldn't have direct access to Air Greenland. So far Topas has been quite insistent that the trip in June will go on, and if I cancel now I would forfeit my deposit, while if they cancel (for any reason) the deposit would be refunded. It seems that from the link you have provided there is leeway to change the flight dates, so I am hoping Topas will let me do so."
"Hi Jellybelly, I am in the same situation with topas travel. I should be traveling on July 16th. And the travel agency keeps saying that I need to do the final payment soon even with all these uncertainties. I am from Brazil and I need to fly to Portugal then to Denmark and then to Greenland... so...lots of borders need to be open for me. I would like to postpone too but l cant loses all that money ( for Brazilians is crazy expensive ...I am not a rich person and I had saved a lot for being able to pay for my dream to come true). With whom you have been dealing at topas?"
"Hi Fe, I am in the same position as you and the final payment is even more than the deposit, so I haven't made payment yet. I will also need to fly through Denmark from Singapore. I have been trying to push for them to postpone but I think they are working remotely as well so responses have been very slow. I'll PM you the name of my contact person."
"you both need to take this to the top of topas. it will be someone in denmark. i'd get together and email and schedule a call. i think you need to threaten them that you'll take action on social media. instagram and facebook, specifically and that this is already being discussed on TA.this is not your fault and it is not feasible that you'll get in to the country this year at this point. if they don't comply, then post here and i'll see what i can do about it. it's not good press for them to do this."
I am so sorry for both of you- sharing your disappointment compounded by all the money issues. I certainly would NOT pay the balance! I looked at their website and it's the only site I have seen since March that doesn't even mention the global Covid 19 situation! Just their address and Denmark #s. Everywhere from my local food coop to national airlines have prominent updates with FAQs to get at least basic answers. Not very helpful...or hopeful.
"Thanks, @onerainyday and @glkllcio. great suggestions!@jellybellymelly let's write something together to then? United we can be stronger!"
"Thanks, all, for the support. I have just received an email from them saying that it is not possible to postpone the trip (regardless of duration with no reasons given), and that if i don't make the remaining payment within 2 days my trip will be deemed cancelled and I will lose my deposit. We will be writing to them jointly and will post any updates on this thread."
"Thanks for the informative thread! I am also supposed to visit Ilulissat from 4th - 9th Sep. As of now, I have the flights booked with Air Greenland. Rest of the things incl. hotel, etc can be cancelled without any penalty. A few questions on the current situation based on what I see in different websites:https:/…https:/…covid-19As it stands now, flight from Copenhagen to Greenland will resume from 1st June, however each traveler has to self quarantine in Greenland for 14 days (+ do Covid test after 5 days). Is my understanding correct on this? The ""visitgreenland"" website says that Air Greenland and Iceland Air are open to changing restrictive tickets but Air Greenland website says that they will only refund airfares for tickets up to 31st May. Not sure if they will provide travel voucher or flexibility to change travel dates, if one has to postpone his/her travel due to above restrictions.Now, coming to my trip in Sep, a lot of things need to get aligned for the trip to happen. I am from US, so at first Denmark has to open its borders and then both Denmark and Greenland have to lift the self quarantine restriction. I would still like to do the trip if it is permitted but things doesn't look that promising now.Finally a few suggestions (from experienced folks: lisa, GLKLLCIO), if I have the option of postponing my trip. As also mentioned in this thread, it will be also of help to local tourism in Greenland if one postpones the trip rather than cancelling the trip. Will there be enough activities to do in October, in case travel is allowed then. I think Eqi glacier trip/s close around end of Sep though one can probably do the kayaking and icefjord viewing + hiking trips in Oct (plus the opportunity to see northern lights). Also, if I have the option of postponing the trip to 2021, is April-May a good time to visit Ilulissat/Greenland. I think Eqi glacier trips won't start then though. Finally how is traveling to Greenland during the peak of winter months (I have been to Alaska several times in winter and have some experience with Arctic winters); are there any visitors at all?Take care & stay safe everyone!"
"I can answer to peak winter months (it's my favourite time in Greenland). First thing to note is that the peak winter time is February to early April (November to January is too dark). Second, yes there are visitors. Less than in summer, certainly, but still quite a few about.Plus points of visiting in winter are that (in my opinion) the country is at its most stunning; you can go dog sledding, on short trips or even multi-day expeditions; there are fewer tourists about; you may get to see the Northern Lights; and the light can be incredible at sunset and sunrise, which last a long time. Even the little things, like seeing a sun dog or seeing the air freeze into tiny crystals can be memorable. A still and sunny winter's day is the best time to be there (again, in my opinion), even - or especially - if it's -25C.Cons of visiting in winter are that it can be seriously cold, especially in the far north and Kangerlussuaq (-40C is not unusual there); a winter storm, while fairly rare, can constrain what you can do and can delay flights; there are fewer flights, especially from Iceland; you can't get to some places, like Eqi; and the sea can be frozen, so boat trips may not be possible (although a trip on a fishing boat through the sea ice - if it's not too solid - is a great experience).Personally, I don't think late April/May is the best time. It's the transition from winter to summer, so it can be wet and cold, but without the pluses of winter. The ground can be sodden with melting snow, and you often get slushy and icy conditions."
"By the way, most of what I've written above applies to Ilulissat, but Kangerlussuaq is worth a couple of days in winter. Given the reduction in flights from Iceland in winter, you'd almost certainly have to change there from Copenhagen anyway. It's an ugly town, but its setting is fantastic, and it's the only place you can get to the ice cap with relative ease. It's also one of the best places in the world for the Northern Lights."
"More sympathies for the poor and unreasonable response of this company compounding your emotional and financial circumstances. On another US travel site, as everyone grapples with what to do, was an informative quote directly from the EU site: ""On 8 May 2020 the Commission recommended an extension of the temporary travel restrictions to the EU+ area by another 30 days. This would expire on 15 June 2020."" Both of you have multiple borders with which to deal. Even assuming they reopen June 16 it seems a great risk to commence your journeys. Also, would you now trust this company to help you evacuate and return home should the borders suddenly close again?"
"Thanks for the tips on winter trip! I have done decent amount of dog sledding myself in Alaska and snow mobiling in Aaska and Yellowstone. So that will b fun. If I have the option of changing travel dates and assuming my Sep trip won't happen, I will consider March'21 for visiting Greenland.For the tour groups & travel agents, even if the borders are open on 16th June, tourism doesn't look feasible (at least just after border opens). As of now, one has to go into 14 day quarantine and do a Covid test after 5 days whiletraveling to Greenland after 1st June. So tourism is not an option. I am also following Faroe Islands (as I am supposed to visit there as well in Sep) and they have said no non essential travel to Faroe Islands until 30th June (which can be extended) + 14 day self quarantine for any traveler. So, currently tourism in Faroe Islands is also not an option and borders of Denmark is still closed.Edited: 1:08 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Guys, this is not acceptable from Topas and I’m very disappointed. I highly suggest linking this thread to your email. This isn’t good publicity for them. Let me know what happens and we will take further action if necessary. I’d also get your credit card involved and stop payment/ reverse charge/ dispute the charge if they keep the deposit. It might be a long road but you should eventually get your money back. It’s really not cool in this time. They should have insurance or eat it if they want to curry favor for future bookings. What a shock. This upsets me a lot.Edited: 10:26 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Prasun - for info, Iceland has said that intends to (sort of) open for visitors after June 15th. There are conditions (you need to agree to be tested, have a valid negative test from your home country, or go into quarantine for 14 days), but it does show that perhaps things are easing slightly. It may mean that if Greenland opens up at all, you could possibly be able to get there from Iceland in September:https:/…Lots of things would need to align - you'd need to be able to get to Keflavik from the USA, you'd need Air Iceland to start running flights again, you'd need Greenland to open up - but, hey. it's a start."
"Dear Friends, topas responded positively to Jelly (despite ""threatening"" that next year prices will be different for her""). However, for me, they said that I must make the final payment because they believe that July everything will be resolved.My question is: if even scientists are not sure of anything ... how can they be?Why do they refuse to reassure me and give me more humane treatment by giving me more time to make this trip?I don't know what I'd be without you guys here from tripadvisor. A huge thanks to everyone."
"Really sorry to hear about this kind of experience that you are going through! What is the policy of Topas if you have paid the full amount and the trip is cancelled? Will they refund you the full amount or will they give a voucher for future tours? I won't be surprised if they would like to get the cash and sit on it now, i.e. give you a voucher for using it in future tours so that they don't face cash crunch. Perhaps we all should mention these responses from Topas in tripadvisor reviews so that they are fully aware that their reputation is tarnished with this kind of attitude towards tourists. At least this is what we can do together and if they Topas sees this kind of negative reviews, they will probably realize that this will harm them more in the long run than having some gains in short term."
What is this from @35.?
Spam. It's been constant on this forum for months now. I've no idea why they're doing it - it's not like the Greenland forum is high traffic.
Exactly. I don’t get it either
"This is the latest update from Air Greenland for ticket refund/cancellation/date change (for restrictive tickets) up to 31st Aug (https:/…covid-19):------------------REFUNDING ATLANTIC TICKETS IN JUNE-JULY-AUGUSTAir Greenland has decided that from May 22nd, it will be possible to change or refund restrictive Atlantic tickets until August 31, 2020. This means that restrictive Atlantic tickets can be refunded or changed to another date on the same route until 30. November 2020. Restrictive tickets can be changed to Standard or Premium tickets. No change fee will be charged until 31st of August. If you would like to have your Atlantic ticket changed or refunded, please fill out this form and send it to websupport@airgreenland.gl.You can change the travel date of your Atlantic ticket once. It is not possible to change an Atlantic ticket to a domestic ticket, however you can get your ticket refunded and then buy a new ticket at airgreenland.com.------------------Also, some flights have already been cancelled for Sep and they have automatically assigned an alternative travel dates. One can request a refund or change of travel dates for those tickets as well. For example, I was scheduled to travel from 4th - 9th Sep to Ilulissat and the return flight from 9th Sep has been cancelled. They have assigned me to a flight on 8th Sep but I can request a refund too. Copy pasting verbatim from Air Greenland website:------------------If you have a canceled ticket as a result of the timetable change, you will get an alternative travel date automatically. If Air Greenland changes your itinerary and the new itinerary is inconvenient for you, please contact us through this form and request another itinerary or a refund. Read more about our general conditions in the regulations.------------------I am sort of inclined to submit the request for a refund now as it looks very unlikely that Denmark will open by Sep and I can fly to Greenland in Sep (without having to quarantine for 14 days).Any updates from tour operators yet who were still insisting that trips will go on in mid-July timeframe?Edited: 7:46 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Thank you for the important update, @Prasun. In my case, Topas delayed my final payment until May 31 and asked me to make a new contact on this date."

"Hi all, just an update that my trip was cancelled in mid May by Topas and they will hold my deposit for a new booking in 2021. It was the right call from them since I would have been entitled to a full refund otherwise, given that Greenland is restricting entry for international travellers in June. @Fe_pena hope all is well for you in Brazil - given the situation in Brazil now, it also seems unlikely that Denmark or Greenland will allow entry in July. Do also keep us updated."
"Latest information re: Covid Travel to Greenland:From Visit Greenland: https:/…coronavirus-status-in-greenlandFrom South Greenland: https://visitsouthgreenland.com/covid-19/Also - keep in mind that the two ports into Greenland are Copenhagen and Reykjavik. So Greenland's opening is also dependent on the opening strategies of those two countries. e.g. Denmark only opened to residents of the Danish Realm, Iceland, Germany, and Norway from 15 June. Noone else may enter until 31 August at this stage."
"Thanks Lisa for the details. Air Greenland is refunding flight tickets until 31st August and also tickets in Sep/Oct for which they already have cancelled flights (or changed flight dates). Based on the conditions imposed on reopening, more restrictions can be added if ""R"" goes above 1 in Denmark. So, its probably safe to assume that there will be very little, if at all any entry to Greenland for anyone outside Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Germany till late/end of 2020. I think it will be very similar in other Danish territories like Faroe Islands as well."
Yep - that's a pretty good guess I think. It's certainly the idea we are working on here in Greenland for now...
"The issue with Air Greenland is that1 They are not refunding internal flights2 If the flights from Copenhagen resume, will they refund them, as we cannot go to Denmark to take them ? Probably not.So I'm afraid I lost 1500 Euros."
"When is your flight? As of now Air Greenland is refunding all flights from Copenhagen to Greenland until 31st August.

"@jellybellymelly thanks, dear. Your help was essential for Topas to do the same for me. I will be dreaming about the colors of Greenland until next year! Now I am fighting against Denmark Hotel ( Astoria Hotel ) ... I booked 3 nights with a non-refundable rate and I am asking a voucher or a discount to rebook for next year but they reply saying they are following the government's recommendations and that I knew the risks of losing money when I chose to pay the lowest price. And yes, I knew, but I never imagined that there would be a pandemic (the last one was 100 years ago) and I thought that in such a unique moment everyone would help each other. Any tips, everyone?"
"I requested Air Greenland today for a ticket refund as its just not possible for us from outside Denamrk, Germany, Iceland and Norway to visit Greenland this summer/Fall. My original flight from Copenhagen to Ilulissat & back was from 4th - 9th Sep. The flight on 9th Sep was cancelled and they put my return flight on another date. Air Greenland usually takes a while to reply back but I can understand the huge amount of email/call volumes they are handling right now. I booked Arctic Hotel for 5 nights for which I have free cancellation option until last week of August and I haven't paid anything upfront. I didn't book any specific trips in Ilulissat yet though I communicated a lot with WOG, Ilulissat Nature Tours and Ilulissat Water Safari,Just like others, I will be dreaming about traveling to Greenland in 2021 and I will take trips with local tour guides; Edvard from Ilulissat Nature Tours (itn.gl) have been very helpful. I will also aim for a longer stay (8-10 days) and split it up between Ilulissat, Kangerlussuaq and Nuuk and will be open for traveling either during winter (Feb-March) or late summer (Sep). As a side note, I think all Danish territories will be following similar restrictions for Covid-19. I have a flight from Copenhagen to Faroe Islands from 29th Aug - 3rd Sep and Atlantic Airways have said that one can get travel voucher for any flight that they cancel until 30th Aug (also they are strictly discouraging non-essential travel to Faroe Islands)."
A quick update from Air Greenland: got an email saying that they have cancelled my ticket and the full airfare will be refunded to my credit card in ~6 weeks time. I would say they were quite prompt and got back to me within 1 day.
"The flight fare from Air Greenland was credited to my credit card account today; so the process took ~1 week from the day I forwarded the request. I have read some complaints about their customer service (especially long wait times during phone calls), though for me customer service has been quite prompt and they have replied to my emails within 3-7 days."
