"Hello all. I’m just being worried about my trip at the end of this month since I’ll be bringing my mother along. I don’t see much news of the virus in Hokkaido on google or online. Could you update me and advise if it’s a good time to fly in? I’ll be hitting a lot of tourist spots like Niseko, Sapporo, Hakodate, Furano and so on."
"A single case was recently identified in Hokkaido, as follows. https:/…044000cThere is no other news from Hokkaido about this issue. You should have a mask, wash your hands, and have a travel insurance which is valid for this infection."
Thanks for updating it. Was it reported on which area it would be?
"The area where the guy lives is kept as a complete secret.There was another case that a lady from Wuhan. She recovered and went back to China.The people who have chronic diseases like diabetes have higher risk. If not, it seems to be just like a cold going over more than a week."
The guy was from asahikawa
"Wow, what's your source?He is reported to be in a ICU."
Cant remember but it was in the local newspaper someone posted And translated in a facebook group
2 cases as someone said already. Concerning that the 2nd case went to 3 different hospitals so he’s spread it around. Everyone here is pretty angry that his location is kept secret. No masks available in any stores. Taxis and public transport might be risky. Rent a car?
"It is too bad that because they were not taking seriously enough the people haven't been to China, many of the patients have visited three to four hospitals and in Tokyo the office workers kept on working."
"We are already renting a car. Any places you think we should avoid? We’re already planning to go since it’s not easy to have all the accommodation, fights and car rental changed."
"Avoid snowy roads.Wash your hands well. You sound like overreacting so far.Edited: 9:11 am, February 16, 2020 "
Yea a little. My other family members are trying to ask us to cancel the trip but I’ve been planning for quite some time. So I just want to make sure I’m getting more information before I go.
So far there is only one guy reported in Hokkaido and he is in an ICU. No report of another case in Hokkaido hasn't been reported.
public transport risky? we are taking bus from airport to kiroro and then bus again to sapporo.from sapporo jr back to the airport. is it that risky to take? worry to drive in snowy road.
"sorry read back the source mentioned from middle of hokkaido..then someone mentioned asahikawa. so not sure how true, but reading he went few hospital i assumed near Sapporo."
He was reported to be a self employee at Ishikari County.No worries to use trains in Hokkaido so far.I guess it's safer than driving on snowy roads if you are not used to it.
"They released the location of the man, he lives in Ishikari. This is near to Sapporo. He attended three hospitals in Sapporo. I would still make your trip. Bring alcohol to disinfect your hands, fever medication and masks. try not to need a hospital."
It’s escalating here. Watching the news. It’s so contagious. If you have any preexisting conditions I’d cancel.
"""preexisting condition""?I guess that means chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart diseases etc."
sorry preexisting condition?news about what? sapporo is spreading? or tokyo side?confusing..so far i read only 2 in hokkaido
Only two cases but the lady from Wuhan cured and went back to China.The guy is critical and is in intensive care unit and so far none of his contact is reported positive yet. Some cases are reported in Tokyo and the tragedy of the contanimated Princess is going on.
I read once we are in japan we can buy sompo and tokie marine medical insurance and they cover covid19..
I think that is the one they have leaflets at the JR East Service Office.
"OP,Don't drive unless you're well experienced in driving on snowy/roads. The probability of running into accidents might even be higher.Skip Niseko unless you'd be skiing there. Not much for sightseeing in winter and more snowy/icy roads in the mountains.Edited: 11:55 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"Hi, I have second thoughts of travelling to Hokkaido as well. My trip will be in early march. Should i proceed or cancel as well?"
"I always check BNO for latest update on caseshttps:/…78 cases for Japan right now. From Yahoo Japan, I believe there are 2 new cases in Hokkaido today not link to other confirmed cases and no travel history. One man in his 40s, office worker who lives alone in Sapporo and a man in 60s in Oshima. There are 4 cases now in Hokkaido, the first case was a Chinese tourist. The latest 3 cases all Japanese, no travel history. I just hope none of the cases attended the Sapporo Snow Festival recently.Edited: 4:04 am, February 19, 2020 "
"Im in sapporo at moment 4 cases in hokkaido at present, areas of concern are tokyo, osaka and that cruise boat, be cautious in airports and major train stations"
Ok noted!Thank You.
Hi Jamie. How is the situation there? Is there any panic? Is everyone wearing a mask?
"1 new case in Hokkaido related to the 4th case confirmed today. Both cases worked in the Sapporo Snow Festival which is worrying. The festival had lower number of people this year, but still a lot of people."
The two guys were reported to be clerks working at the office.
"My husband recently went to Sapporo and Niseko - to be exact Feb 2 to 14. He was at the Sapporo Snow Festival two days in a row. The park is wide open and like some posts indicated, there were visitors but it was not like they are all in a confined space. No one was wearing mask. I think proper clean hands hygiene is sufficient and don't touch your face until you washed/sanitized your hands.He is back to US and out of consideration for the community. He is staying home for 2 weeks. He eats by himself. We are lucky that he has his own bedroom/bathroom.to minimize contact with other family member."

Anyone knows how much does it cost for travel insurance that cover coronavirus? And where can you purchase it?
"Please folks - don't cancel.Hokkaido is huge.Millions of people in big open spaces.2 million in Sapporo.5 million in Hokkaido.There are 5 reported cases of CV as of today.If you come to Japan on holiday, the riskiest places will probably be your home airport and the arriving airport in Japan - because many people from many countries are passing thru every day.Take precautions:wash hands a lotWear a mask or gloves - but change them regularlydon't eat free sample foods in public places like airports and souvenir shops.don't touch your face a lottravel on public transport - but try not to be in a crowd.Hokkaido is a beautiful, fun place to come to - please come!Yes, cases are increasing in Japan and of course here too, but the same can be said for many other parts of the world, specially Asia.Amanda"
"Hi i'm also thinking whether I should go or not, my trip is mainly for skiing for 2 weeks in Niseko. I'm supposed to be flying out next Sat with my 2 young kids (3 and 7), Feb 29 but am worried. Is there an english source for infections in Hokkaido? Wanted to keep an eye on that mainly"
"You can check NHK Japan and use Google Translatehttps://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/…For Hokkaido, the latest update 21 Feb is 8 cases total so far. 3 new cases confirmed today, 2 in 3 cases are kids under 10."
Thanks for the link Eddenia.This really sucks because I was really looking fwd to going to Niseko. Worrying that the 2 new cases are children because they are largely unaffected everywhere else.
we suppose to leave tonight for ski in kiroro. we cancelled in on thursday night postpone to october.my main reason to cancel it was because we have a 5 yo. we have decided we wont be able to enjoy the trip as i will be stressful taking care and making sure she dont do this and that. if things are better during easter we might fly there to ski if there's still snow.
"also i read the new case is a quarantine officer at the airport.on another note, if we are just adults we will probably continue with the trip. :("
"Good choice, you just can't watch kids all the time. They like to touch everything and don't like to wash hands. There's a new case in Kumamoto of a guy who recently went to Hokkaido and Sapporo Snow Festival today. They said it's likely that he got infected in Hokkaido."
"i will come the end of August as long as the plane will take me. life is too short to worry about death. I enjoy my annual trip to Sapporo and Hokkaido and spend so much time preparing, that this , to me, is considered a very minor crisis that will not affect me since others who worry about it will become infected if someone has to be infected"
We're still thinking to go niseko with the kids so will c I guess. Will update you all how everything is
go- i'm sure the common flu is worse than this

The flu is not as deadly. It just spreads to more people
"we had our trip to sapporo-otaru-noboretsu ( hell valley ), lake toya, hakodate, asahikawa.. to hit all 5 of snow festivals. from 7th-19th feb.during that time. we watched japanese news every morning before our day trip start for corona virus update. that time NO ONE was infected at all, other than diamond prince passenger. and other countries.All tourist areas we visited were busy (not over crowded due to not existent of china tour group buses) with other countries included other asian countries. Mask wearers can been seen sparingly. hard to buy mask if you go 30 minutes after shops' opening time.every hotels, restaurants included small hole in wall ramen eateries we visited and dined provided hand sanitaser bottle for us to use BEFORE entering their place.airport do temp check on arrival. we also BRING OUR own antibacterial hand wipe, sanitaser oil. And we use them EVERY TIME before / after touch anything around us.local population had provided very high standard of hygiene from my observation. Even higher than Australia standard where we live.During our stay on those cities temp went to -12c and only reach high of 6c ( don't know in F ) , therefore if you bring elderly parent it may be a chalenge to walk cause foothpath can be snowed (4cm think) or iced . We had to buy add-on-spike for our winter booth or walking shoes. probably good hiking booth will be better gripi'm not sure the weather will be , when you there. our were snowy most days. only 2 days are sunny and melt the ice and snows, then after that roads and footpaths covered againWe had seen few elderly tourist at those tourist area. but elderly local seem walking everywhere with ease.however with recent update there were few CORONA infection at sapporo. 1 corporate gentlemen in 40's reported to hospital 7th feb3 (in 1 family evacuated from wuhan stay in FURANO, 2 are under 10 years old) reported to hospital 21sf Feb , and 1 quarantine lady officer work New Chitose Airport as today.because of this new case developed at sapporo. Their behaviour and situation may be changed from last 2 weeks when I was there.during that time, they already practicing high standard of hand hygiene, and precaution. I hope this info may be useful . If i may suggest, bring your own antibacterial necessities which include sanitiser, and if you think mask useful for you take them, cause hard to buy there."

Does anyone know the link to Japan’s official website of news? I don’t mind even if it is in Japanese.

9 new cases discovered yesterday with total of 26 in Hokkaido as of Feb 23. https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl…
"DebbieLook online for The Japan TimesThe Mainichi NewsYomiuri NewsNot sure what you mean by ""official""? These are respected newpapers, online and in paper form.There isn't much information in English for Hokkaido.But this is the local government website.…hokkaido.lg.jp/ss/tsk/promo/coronavirus.htmThe virus is undoubtedly spreading. This has been a 3 day weekend with bad weather, so most people stayed home. But tomorrow everyone will go back to work and school.Amanda"
And here is the government website with information about statistics and press conferences. But the translation isn't keeping up with events and numbers.https:/…newpage_00032.html
Grateful for all the tips and contributions on this forum thread. Am also following this topic as we are planning to head to Hokkaido in March with young kids.
"we are now cancelling our trip sadly as seems hokkaido is breaking out badly. second most in Japan.https:/…2020_coronavirus_outbreak_in_JapanWiki does a good summary of everything, hope this helps those that are still planning to go."
"Tess: From my experience of cancelling my trip with extra incur charges. I would suggest to get a travel insurance that covers any travel changes so you’re able to get some cash back even if you plan to cancel.All: I would like to express my gratitude for providing information directly from japan and Hokkaido. Really appreciate this. Unfortunately, we have decided to postpone to 2021 since we don’t want to take the risk at all.Edited: 12:55 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"we delayed till october. we paid for changes with flight. we have travel insurance, but as far as i know insurance company wont pay for such delay if it is not by the airlines :("
We are planning to fly to Niseko next weekend too with a 3 yr old . How's the situation there now any idea? Thanks in advance !
35 cases in Hokkaido. I wouldn’t. The governor of Hokkaido has recommended closing schools here.

Im going to postpone my trip to Hokkaido as well..Supposed to be flying on next wed. How sad..have been looking forward to skiing as well..
"I have just returned from Niseko. If you have not already left, do not go. https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/…"
"Hi guys,I'm skiing in Niseko in two weeks.So far WHO and governments have a green light for going. Some recommend some extra precautions (hygiene).No recommendations to reconsider traveling anywhere in Japan so far, let alone Niseko.Being young and healthy... I do not see why not going, checking the vblogs of the people there everything seems reasonably fine.What are your thoughts?"
"This is the current travel advisory to Japan from...- WHO:https:/…- The UK:https:/…health- The USA:https:/…japan-travel-advisory.html- Canada:https:/…216- The Netherlands:https:/…reisadvies(Use Google translate).All of these just notify that there is this epidemic but the traveller should exercise USUAL precautions, other than the USA that specify that the traveller should exercise enhanced precautions when travelling to Japan."
"The schools have been closed, Hokkaido has the largest cluster in all of Japan. We have worked with our hotel in Niseko and they are willing to let us change our dates of stay to next March. Our carrier just cancelled its flights into Seoul and will most likely be cancelling the Sapporo route, so I can most likely get a refund. I am reluctant to burden a community with my presence while they address this very complex pandemic."
I live in Niseko and haven’t heard of any cases here. Everyone goes about their day as usual and people here do not wear face masks.Bars and restaurants are business as usual.
"the situation now is very different. Spreading in Japan and spreading in Europe. My country already sent out warning to avoid unnecessary to Japan as well.A new case last night here, a lady who came back from Japan recently. Not sure which part of Japan she went but it just proved to me our decision was right to delay the trip.skiing can be done other times in my opinion."
"Just spoke with a friend in Asahikawa and she said the whole city is on lockdown, schools canceled ect. She lives in the country and they can't leave their home."
"https:/… The governor of Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido has declared the spread of the virus in his prefecture an emergency, calling on residents to stay home this weekend and only go out if necessary. This state of emergency is up to 19 March."
Does the state of emergency means that all tourist attractions (including the ski resorts) will close down? I was planning to go skiing in Niseko and tour Hokkaido coming wednesday but don't think that would be possible anymore if the ski resorts and attractions are closed down.
"As far as I read everywhere (what does the state of emergency mean?), shops are open, transportation works, flights are not cancelled... The only request I clearly see is for people that can, stay at home.As for the resorts, check the webcams (live) for yourself:https://www.niseko.ne.jp/en/livecamera/Always better to see it live, rather than believing what other people may think.I am also concerned. Please check reliable sources. Trust governmental health institutions (I posted a few links before) more than the news or personal opinions.Check this video blog colection (updated with live feeds almost daily):https:/…videosUpdated daily, yesterday specifically on this topic. At least this guy is right there, on video, updating us live on the situation.I am so far still going to go to Niseko at the end of next week if they let me, every time you come out of your bed you are risking something. If I was a heavy smoker, senior or had any serious risk factors I would reconsider (as I would if I would be going to the USA where there's a HUGE influenza problem).Niseko itself does not have cases and most cases in Hokkaido are in towns in the east, south east and south of Sapporo, not that much even in Sapporo. We are talking about 40-50 cases in the whole of Hokkaido, there's almost 40 only in Spain pretty much overnight."
"yeah, as far as today, there are no warning advisory from Govt.but you made a point, that it's true the problem comes when we asked to quarantine and even worse if anyone of us get infected, though the chance if you are careful enough is not very high, but again to us the risk is high. so yeah we postpone the trip (still workin with hotel and flight - hopefully they understand and able to refund)"
"as of today, Niseko ski resorts are opening - business as usual.https:/…Niseko-NowCoronavirus Outbreakhttps://www.japan-guide.com/news/alerts.html>>Niseko itself does not have cases maybe due to lack of hospitals in Kutchan, insufficient test kits etc.Edited: 9:52 pm, February 28, 2020 "

"I managed to drill it down a bit but I cannot find it now, it was not easy to find.From what I remember a school in Nakafurano and a fair in Kitami were a couple of the hot spots (hot meaning 3-7 cases each).You can get some details here: https:/…2020_coronavirus_outbreak_in_Japan but they do not drill down to the town level.There were another two villages south and south east of Sapporo (far, but closer than Nakafurano) and some cases in Sapporo city.I will try to find the information again later.Some more webcams from Niseko:https:/…latestAbout what is ""closed"" in Hokkaido:https:/…anchorIt looks like it is only two museus:Hokkaido Museum of Modern ArtHokkaido Asahikawa Museum of ArtKRs."
"The cluster case is at the fair in Kitami caused 6 positives and each of them went back to their own towns. ""a school in Nakafurano"" is so far just the two brothers at Nakafurano Elementary School.Firefighter at a certain town and the doctor who checked that firefighter.Town delegate and the nurse who took care of that patient.So many separate cases are reported, pushing it up to 67. A lady in her 90s were reported today.Hokkaido seemed to be carrying out the PCR tests quite well compared to other areas of Japan.Edited: 5:34 am, February 29, 2020 "
"That information about the Kitano fair seems to be more updated, however I read that some cases stayed in Kitano, some went to Sapporo. It does not really matter, that fair probably played a big role in the declaration of the state of emergency and there are probably more cases linked to it.There were also a school bus driver and a school worker, there are a number of places mentioned here:https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/02/b…Locations are Ebetsu, Tomakomai, Aibetsu.Nakafurano is about 95 kilometers northeast of Hokkaido's capital Sapporo, Tomakomai is 50 km to the south, Ebetsu is 15 km from the center of Sapporo and Aibetsu is some 135 km to the northeast.I believe the authorities are doing a great job balancing contention, economic impact, freedom, etc.If you have links with detailed data (not the news), please share them."
"Well, what really mattered for the Governor of Hokkaido to make the decision was that many cases were scattered nearly all over Hokkaido than just limited to a certain area.Edited: 6:23 am, February 29, 2020 "
"Although it may not be very relevant, here you are a very detailed drill down of all the cases confirmed in Hokkaido:…hiecc.or.jp/soudan/…file1_en_1582880320.pdfI am in contact with several people in Niseko, everything is open as usual, there are less people than usual but not significantly less.Cheers."
"We just got back from Hokkaido. Note that the population is very spread out in small towns, but MANY, MANY tourists from Taiwan and Singapore. - likely carriers. As you know, Japanese are VERY clean - almost everyone wearing a mask, Still there is a lot of contact in crowds, buffets and Onsen. I've been home 5 days - so far, so good, but I would not go back right now. Even concerned about Australia in May!"
"Thanks for all the info everyone!Have trip to Rusutsu in 2 weeks. Anyone currently there? Didn’t see any reports but not sure. Resort reports they’re still open and hoping it’ll stay that way.Leaning towards keeping ski trip as no kids or elderly on this trip. And it also sounds like isolated cases and not concentrated at ski resorts.However, balancing that with how much people around me after the trip will freak out being around me after getting home.Edited: 1:59 pm, February 29, 2020 "
Hi we should be flying out on 9th March. Does anyone know what it is currently like in Sapporo? We are due to stay for 2 weeks. Not sure what to do.
"A State of Emergency has been declared for the entire island of Hokkaido. We decided it was not worth the risk for our group of 4 adults age 67 to 73. We are having an extremely difficult time getting a refund from our hotel, Skye Niseko."
">>We are having an extremely difficult time getting a refund from our hotel, Skye Niseko.<<That is a shame. I understand the vast majority of hotels are now refunding *nonrefundable* rooms and even AirBnB is refunding without a penalty."
"Hi doninsavannah, I really feel sad to read about your concerns of people coming from Singapore and especially Taiwan in this regard. Have you even taken a look at how they are dealing with the outbreak there, how many cases they have, etc?Check how many cases are in Italy, France, Iran, Germany or even Spain... And how many they have in Taiwan.Have you guys checked your governmental recommendations for going (or not) to Japan? The recommendations of the WHO? Have you seen what it means in practical terms the ""State of emergency"" at this point? Please do, you may think different.As for Sapporo, this is my personal opinion: There will probably be way less people in the streets, especially on weekends."
