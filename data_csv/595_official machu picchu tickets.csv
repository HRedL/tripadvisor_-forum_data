"hi, i am looking to buy ticket in advance via online to do a self exploration of site.i have tried looking at site below which i understand is official site to book ticketshttps://www.machupicchu.gob.pe/iniciothe site seem to be unavailable for a long time. please guide me where can i book ticketsthanks in advance"
That is the official site. When are you planning on visit? They have suspended ticket sales due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
I am intending in aug. Got train booked via peru railway. Accept that we cannot be sure on when travel restrictions would be lifted.
"This website is the correct one. Sale of tickets is stopped due to the COVID-19 crisis. You'll need to wait it out until tickets are available for sale again, just keep looking on the website regularly, i imagine as soon as the government announces when they can open up again, they'll start selling tickets. You may be able to travel in August, but there is still a chance it will get cancelled. Also bear in mind that countries are likely to enforce boarder restrictions and quarantine periods beyond lockdown. I hope you manage to get there, I'm sure you'll love Machu Picchu."
Thank you for a clear detailed reply

"Peru is under lockdown until May 24th.Re opening will slowly start but I do not know when tourism will ne allowed back into PeruI would not count on it until at the earliest, end of the year, if at all"
Thank you. Some of hotels are already suggesting oct as earliest opening. So aug is only a remote possibility. The perurail allows to book train in aug to machu Picchu but trains can be cancelled a week earlier..
Lockdown has been extended until June 30thNo news yet on when tourism will be reopened
"Does the lockdown achieve anything in Peru ? Here in Europe, most governments decided that the lockdown had been successful in its objectives and are now actively lifting it. So we wonder what happens in Peru (or in Argentina)."
