"Hi Everyone, I’m not sure how easy or difficult it is right now with getting reservations, but just wanted to post that I’ve just canceled our reservation for a Western Cabin at Bryce for July 30, in case someone is looking for one... also canceled July 28-30 at Austin’s Chuckwagon Lodge in case that helps someone as well. Sadly, we have to cancel our trip to Utah as there’s too much risk with COVID-19 for us to travel there from out of the country. We’ll have to stick closer to home this time... We had been looking forward to this vacation since last fall and I just wanted to take the time as well to thank the Tripadvisor local experts and others who had helped me last fall in the planning - much appreciated! Maybe we can try planning for next year if things settle..."
We cancelled our trip as well to Utah over the Memorial Day weekend. Looking forward to COVID-19 vaccine(s) and early onset therapeutics

"SwimFan - me too, looking forward to a vaccine!!MDESSM - thanks for your comment. I kept holding out hope that something would somehow change, and waited to just about the last minute to actually cancel, but really the writing has been on the wall for some time now!"
