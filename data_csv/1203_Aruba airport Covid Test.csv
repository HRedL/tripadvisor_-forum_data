Has anyone been given the Covid Test in the airport? And if so what was the turn around time for results?
People who are already on the island are saying anywhere from 6-24 hours.
Not coming til Feb/March Hoping this all clears up by then !!! - fingers crossed !!
"Also too,a few folks have posted that the results are loaded to the Health App an hour or more BEFORE they send the email.So, check the app often.Edited: 9:48 am, July 15, 2020 "
get a test before you travel imo .
We did and the results were on the app at 5am when I checked and the email came at 7am. It was super quick and easy. Forget trying to get it done before if you don’t have to!
Everyone should try and test at home if possible. No reason to take all the risk associated with travel only to get to Aruba and wind up in isolation at some unknown location.
"I agree. I would do the test on arrival as a last resort if my results are not in on time. Besides, would rather spend the $$ on happy hour :)"
"Come on Johnny. Could be worse.. tEdited: 12:23 pm, July 16, 2020 "
Worse than being an asymptomatic carrier of Covid-19 and then sitting on a plane for several hours only to find out you test positive in Aruba? OK.
"Agree Suntan and Johnny T,Anyone waiting to test in Aruba could be asymptomatic and infect people on plane, at airport and in Aruba. Then test positive and be in isolation in Aruba for 2 weeks or more. I understand everyone wants to go but this is not fair to fellow travelers and to Aruba who needs to keep Covid away"
"I agree Johnny. Everyone SHOULD be tested before departing. My concern is that it is not bullet proof. Tests are taking too long to get results in time. Also, error in testing is possible along with the possibility of contracting covid along the way and winding up in isolation once on the island.Edited: 7:49 am, July 17, 2020 "
"We are traveling to Aruba in August. We plan to test at home 5 days prior, even though this is not within Aruba timeline, to make sure that we know our status before travel. We will also pay to test at the airport in Aruba. We don't want to fly there without knowing our status ahead of time. This is a strict protocol but we appreciate it after quarantining and wearing masks faithfully for 4 months we don't want to go to any Caribbean getaway where Covid is strong and active (like Mexico and DR) where you can get in with just a temperature scan."
"If you think errors in testing can happens in the states, then don’t be naive enough to think it can’t happen in Aruba. Be careful with that logic. Like you said, nothing is bulletproof."

"Curious if anyone else has been tested at the airport recently? We are worried with unpredictable turnaround times that our test in PA will not be returned timely. We could go get a 20-minute antigen test for our own knowledge (verifying to the best of our ability that we are not asymptomatic) but realize those are not as reliable as PCR and aren't accepted in lieu of airport testing.Edited: 10:48 am, August 16, 2020 "
"That’s my goal, but I’m concerned about that 72 hour window"
Does anyone have any information on how long the process is taking at the airport?
