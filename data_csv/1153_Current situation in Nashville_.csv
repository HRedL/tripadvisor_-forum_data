"Our family has never been to Nashville so we thought we would do an overnight stop there this summer on our way down to Florida, just to get a taste of the area for a future trip. We will have about half a day and the evening there. So two questions. We are thinking to stay at the Hyatt Place Hotel just because the because the bed configuration would fit our family and because it looks like it's close to everything. We don't want to spend extra time driving in since our time will be so limited. Can anyone tell me if this is a good choice, both location wise but also quality of the hotel? Also, just wondering what the current situation is there between Covid and all of the rioting going on, we are second guessing if this is a good time to do this? Any and all advice or info will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
"The Hyatt Place is a great location and generally gets good reviews. Some of the lesser reviews tend to have more to do with outside construction noise, but there isn't as much now as there was in the past, at least close by. The location is great. Before the hotel was built, the business that was there was where I parked when going to a downtown event.As for the other happenings you mentioned in your post. No one knows what the tenor will be at any time in the future. Some businesses are closed as a result of one or both of the events for various reasons. When the choose to reopen will be determined by the events of both issues. With the exception of what were seemingly a small group of rogues there has been no discord since May 30 / 31. Any demonstrations since then have been peaceful, although they have disrupted traffic flow and I'm not sure the language used has been ""family friendly""."
"The Hyatt Place hotel has a new Hyatt hotel under construction literally right across the street, so there's still a lot of construction noise if you face the front. However, you'll be hard pressed to find any hotel in downtown Nashville that doesn't have construction nearby."
We are planning a trip to Nashville in Sept. I was going to book the Hyatt Place since we are members until I saw the price. Perhaps the price is higher during our trip due to Labor Day. We decided to go with the Hampton Inn which is still in that general area.
Here's a link to Nashville's COVID-19 plan for reopening:asafenashville.org/roadmap-for-reopening-nasâ€¦ The city is still in phase II at this time.
So probably early next month for Phase 3.
"There is no predicting when we will go the Phase 3. Nashville is more sensible than the state as a whole, but I don't think they would have the political will to go back to Phase 1. We could, however, be in Phase 2 for a long time."
"Phase 3 is not determined by a specific DATE! The mayor is being led by medical experts and the scientific data when to move forward - to protect the health and safety of our community.For more information, pls refer to the public information website updated dailyhttps://www.asafenashville.org/Green - good and we move forward to Phase 3Yellow - not so good and we ""pause"" in Phone 2"
