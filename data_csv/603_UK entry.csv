Does anybody know if we will be able to enter montenegro from the UK... We are due to fly 27th of august
"Thankyou, how do we find this out? I'm presuming our flight won't go if we're not allowed in"
The number of people in the UK with the virus needs to be below 5000 before they'll let us in.. I saw on one of the daily press conferences the other day it said there are currently 53000 so a very long way to go yet. I have a booking for next May and I'm not holding much hope.
I am also interested to know if our flight will be cancelled. We are supposed to be flying on July 3rd.
"Yes, I agreed the maths wasn't right - but this number of 5000 I read on an official Montenegrin website somewhere, I can't seem to find the link now though."
Did your flight get cancelled?We are booked on Ryanair flight from Stansted to Podgorica on 5th July and our flight still shows as scheduled despite UK citizens not being allowed to enter ..... this leaves you in the tricky situation that you cannot travel but your flight has not been cancelled so refund will be difficult.
The government are still saying non essential travel. So you will be able to get a refund
"We have a flight booked from Manchester to Tivat on the 16th July. Fully expecting it to be cancelled and wish Jet2 would just get on with it so we can start the refund process. Not sure why flights to Spain etc are being cancelled and ours isn’t, especially as people from UK aren’t even allowed into Montenegro."
Unfortunately even though montenegro won't let Brits in.. The flight will still go.. If you go you will have to quarantine for 2wks on arrival... Ours is 27th August.. But I'm going to pay the 35£ each to change to next year
"Hey there, I would assume that the measures for entrance to Montenegro will be further loosened from July 1 according to the news. As we badly need tourists and because Ryanair starts flying into Podgorica from the beginning of July I would guess the Brits would be allowed in but you might need a negative PCR on covid 19 done 48 hours before your trip. AS soon as we get new information on it I will update you. Confusing times :("
"Our Ryanair flight to Podgorica on July 5th from Stansted is now showing as cancelled ...... very sad situation, we were really looking forward to seeing the country. Hopefully next year."
We've cancelled our hotel and flight for the 27th August.. We've moved it to August next year.Of a cost of 179q.Part admin fee part flight increase.. Hotel has just moved it to next year free of charge
Flight will go I think but montenegro won't let you in without quarantine.. Which is a waste of time
"Jet2 to tivat on 27th has now been cancelled by airline. SO full refund on flight Thankfully my hotel has free cancellation.Doesnt look like they are flying there again until summer 2021.Prices for next year look double the price as they try and pick up the re-bookers, not worth booking again yet."
We are due out on 15th July. Not sure how we can quarantine for 2 weeks on a week long holiday.
Hi JonathanHope you don't mind me messaging you. Have you had any further updates on your holiday since today's announcement? I find it all so confusing. We are due to fly to Tivat on 18th August. Hope everything turns out good for you.Many thanks Vicky
"Hi Vicky,Who are you flying with? My understanding is all Jet2 flights to Tivat cancelled until May 2021. Our flight at end of August was cancelled."
Hi CarolineWe are flying with Easy jet but going off what you have said think it will also be cancelled. Thank you for your reply. We have booked package the through Travel Republic and are advising us 14 days before holiday. Too last minute for us as need to get organised. Take care thanks again Vicky
Where did you see this?.. Why have they cancelled till next year?
I think the easyjet flights from Gatwick to Tivat are still running...looks.like you can still book them.
