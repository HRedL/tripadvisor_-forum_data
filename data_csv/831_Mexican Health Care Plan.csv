Iâ€™m an Canadian expat coming back down to my condo in PV for 4 months in January . I have my Mexican temporary residency and was wondering what is available for Mexican health care plans. Buying a 4 month extended medical plan from a Canadian supplier seems expensive .
"The medical care in Mexico is profesional, competent, and reasonably priced. The problem is that them medical system in Mexico is a covid-19 vector."
We have insurance through VUMI for our health care here in Mexico. Feel free to contact their local agent Guardian Insurance. Send me a pm if you want more information.
You have to have your Mexican visa before you apply for IMSS. It is cheap but you need to have someone on the outside to bring your meals. They are also Covid hotspots.Canadian insurance is expensive because it includes coverage in the US. And it increases every year.There are policies that exclude the US but they are not that much cheaper. Usually you cannot get Canadian coverage without US coverage.
"We are two people aged over 60 but under 65, for 120 days medical insurance, we pay around $500 Cdn dollars each, bought in Canada. We shop around each year for the cheapest. This past year RBC was the best. We just include it into the cost of traveling."
