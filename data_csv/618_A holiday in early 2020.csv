"FriendsI have just taken my first look at the possibility of booking a fortnight at the Bella Vista Hotel, Hurghada, from the 26th January to 9th February 2020, with Travel Republic.If I were to book Flights and Accommodation, through them, I would have to pay a minimum deposit of over £220. However, if I book the Hotel with them and the flights with EasyJet, separately, then whilst I must pay the full flight price, I need only pay a deposit of £15 to TR.Two questions then ...First, for those who had holidays booked now and this Summer, flying with EasyJet, have you had any particular problems getting refunded or 12 month Vouchers?Secondly, looking at the current situation would you say that making a booking, at this time, for next January, is foolhardy or fairly safe. Overall the full price of £615 is very tempting.Thanking-you and hoping you are all wellAnthony K"
"You mean 2021, right?"
Thank-you Clint. 999 SunshineI'm a fool ... naturally that should be early 2021 ... quarantine gets you like that.CheersAnthony
"So sorry all ... my ""2020"" should be 2021, throughout.Anthony K"
"Easyjet have been easy to deal with. Changed flights online, no problem. Got a voucher for another which I've used some for flight next March.Travel Republic have beem good too, again moving my booking. 2021 we hope will be holidays for us all to the place we love"
"Caz & Clint - Thank-you for your responses and advice, given so quickly. I was looking to you for exactly that.I have now completed my booking from the 26th January to 9th February 2021, with both Travel Republic and EasyJet.The price seems very good for both, including Hold baggage and an AI booking at the Hotel. The only thing I have not yet bothered with is a Transfer booking.My full final price is just £618, plus Transfers.I hope that things begin returning to some sort of normality soon and that everyone keeps well and gets the Holidays they have booked for.Best wishesAnthony K"
"We have permanent Annual Travel insurance. My Research Assistant phoned them recently to check on this subject.The response was:-For any bookings made before the current crisis, we are insured. We have one for Luxor in August that was booked before March 2020 and if we could fly, we would be covered, even if the date was moved.However, with the current FCO restriction of ‘Essential Travel Only’, if we made a NEW booking whilst it was in force, then, even if we were travelling after it ended, we would not be covered because we had booked while it was in force. They kept using the term – ‘A known factor when you booked’ They basically weren’t issuing new policies anyway since they were far too busy trying to deal with the existing claims, ours being one, and when they started again, there would be a new handbook with revised cover details.The RA then phoned a couple of others and basically got the same story.So, I would strongly recommend that anyone who foolishly, just ‘thinks’ they are OK, actually checks with their own insurance and gets it confirmed in writing that they are covered, so that they ‘Know’ they are covered."
"eLaReFNot needed to go to my insurance provider's Policy, so far, as Airlines and Hotels have been more than considerate when discussing vouchers, refunds and the moving of dates.CheersAnthony K"
"I didn't think you bothered about insurance anyway?I gave 2 cases- already booked and moving or a NEW booking.I always try to answer for anybody reading the forum, but you are saying the airlines and hotels are being reasonable - Of course they are they want to hold onto your booking money.You didn't mention insurance being reasonable - the difference is they do not want to pay up.CHECK!"
"eLaReFInsurance companies never want to pay up, whenever a claim is made.I do not know where you get the idea that I ignore Travel Insurance. Inoculations are the thing I tend to ignore. I always have a Policy.When there is a pandemic, of this devastating type, that leads to such ""lockdowns,"" Worldwide, Airlines and Hotels will try to be helpful ... it's a silver lining to a cloud, you might say.Keep wellAnthony K"
"Caz - I never suggested that Airlines, Agents or Hotels, booked direct are OK. I simply suggested that in the current environment they are trying to be helpful. Most would, obviously, wish to offer you a Voucher or a simple Re-booking, to a later date, rather than give a refund.In my case I am missing one vacation, not to Hurghada, and the small Hotel Group, that I book with direct, simply agreed my new dates and transferred my payment across. Even though, when I paid for it it was noted as non-refundable.As for the Airline, BA, I had a choice of waiting until 72 hours before my departure and getting a refund or simply filling in a very short form, online, and taking a full voucher. I took the voucher and used it against a later booking.Now the Hotel, Airline and myself will not lose out ... apart from everything happening in October rather than May.CheersAnthony K"
Sorry Anthony - You are correct - It was vaccinations (That's what I get from doing things from (a fallible) memory!An article from Whichhttps:/…rebook
That link starts in the middle of the page for some reasonStart here (hopefully)https:/…
"Re post #11, does that mean that if a vaccine for COVID-19 became avail you would not get it?"
"Anthony i was talking about the insurance side. That it's all well and good booking a holiday but without proper insurance cover, booked before the covid outbreak, then it's a risk going abroad. The insurance wouldn't cover for cancellation etc either due to covid.It wasn't a dig about airlines. They're all allowing rebooking or voucher or refund at this present time.No one knows when we will fly again, just wish for this current situation to go away and normality resume, but think that's a distant dream :("
Re Post 16 ... I hope a successful vaccine to combat Covid-19 is discovered sooner rather than later and yes I would accept that inoculation.Caz ... I am one of those who reads all the small print in Insurance Policies ... not the most exciting part of filling my time.Keep well allAnthony
"Apologies for going off-topic for a moment ...May I say, in all honesty, that I have not pressed any buttons, recently, to close any Topic on this Forum.Thank-youAnthony K"
"AK, you've changed your tune re vaccines?The one who always advocated not bothering about them."
"A Flu vaccine is one that I have, at my Doctor's insistence, annually. A anti-coronavirus vaccination would be foolish to refuse.As for others, when I visit Egypt, I take my chances.That is simply my personal viewpoint ... I am not looking to influence anyone.CheersAnthony K"
"I've got a feeling you won't ""influenze"" anyone tbh.Brian, just noticed the....recently bit lolEdited: 6:54 am, May 03, 2020 "
BB Re post 22As recent as accusations made elsewhere.Keep wellAnthony K
The problem is that stupidity spreads like a virus and has no vaccine!
"There certainly appears to be a second pandemic currently raging, symptoms of which include:The booking of flights and holidays which may or may not happen. The assumption that drinks, food and reading matter will be available on the flight. A naive expectation that once at the destination everything about the holiday will be exactly as in the past. An assumption that buffet meals will be self-served in friendly busy restaurants, guests chatting happily to each other in the chip queue. An anticipation of unmasked waiters smiling openly as they serve drinks behind the bar. An eager anticipation of lying on a sunbed close enough to allow daily chats and banter with fellow guests on adjacent beds. Receptions staffed by friendly unmasked staff on the other side of a desk devoid of perspex protective barrier etc etc. The most common symptom of the condition appears to be an inability to realise that nobody knows the sort of conditions and rules under which hotels will have to operate in any given country and that the holiday they assume they will get may actually turn put to be very different."
"Well Said - Agree totallyUntil the FCO says OK & I've been given a vaccination, I might keep looking at web-sites, but no way am I making any new bookings, even if the companies say they can be moved back. That company might have gone bust by then."
"A holiday abroad will be very different I'm sure. We all want to visit the country we love and support tourism but what will it be like?Lots of variations and theories, this article is interesting https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52450038?at_campaign=64&at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D&at_custom4=E613F80E-8D12-11EA-A051-C1093A982C1E&at_custom2=facebook_page&at_custom3=BBC+News&at_medium=custom7"
