"Hi all,Coming over for a week in April 2021.Couple of questions.Can anyone point me towards a local vineyard tour guide ? Is there any towns worth visiting outside of Budapest that you can catch a train to within 2hrs ?ThanksTony"
"Eger is a couple of hours outside BP by train or bus. Very compact town centre with plenty to see and do, including many wine cellars."
"Agree with Paul, Eger fits the bill. Hungary is a small country, most towns and cities can be reached in 2 hours by train. Vienna is only 2.25 hours. As for a wine tour, after Covid-19 who knows what sort of tourist stuff will be available ?"
"""As for a wine tour, after Covid-19 who knows what sort of tourist stuff will be available ?""I tell you: Exactly the same as before COVID-19"
You could also go to and spend the day in Szentendre ---> thatbackpacker.com/2017/…On a nice day we like to go by boat.Pjk
"""Exactly the same as before COVID-19""It is simply not possible to make a statement like that. I already know of a restaurant local to me that will not re-open - OK I live in the suburbs, but to imagine that the day after Mr Orban opens the borders that tourist traffic will immediately return to 2019 levels is ridiculous. Tourist spending is discretionary spending, and a significant portion of the people in places like the UK and Germany will be paying off debts accumulated during the lockdown, not leaping on a plane to Budapest/ wherever, to say nothing of those who remain unemployed. I sincerely hope for the sake of the Hungarians that the vast majority of people keep their jobs in tourism, but there will be casualties everywhere. As I said, nobody knows what will be available to tourists - and locals - when this is all over."
"There was a shortage in some other areas before and there were too many people in tourism so I hope not all the people in tourism will keep their jobs and they can go (back) to some other areas, for example education or healthcare. But on the other hand I really hope they (teachers, nurses and so on) will be paid more than before."
"A full year without tourism will kill many businesses.Two months shutdown and lack of demand will put most manufacturing in serious crisis. I struggle to understand the kind of word we will awaken to, even if we don't have a resurgence of Covid-19. Hospitality, tourism, airlines all shot."
"kbzs, I agree: as I know from Hungarian friends, teacher's pay here is a disgrace: and young people are not entering the profession, something like 30% of teachers are over 60. A friend who is highly qualified as an English teacher brings home less than £400 per month."
