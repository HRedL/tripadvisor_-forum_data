"The numbers look good and encouraging.However, were the flights from countries with low and/or better records for dealing with the virus?"
Interesting please continue to post as you see these results. Thank you.
what of people that have it only at the incubation stage where tests fail to show anything up until 4 days later
I'd be interested in the results from people from Italy which had one of the worse outbreaks of the virus.If Italy is allowed then maybe the US would be allowed even though our infection rates have been increasing dramatically in a number of states that opened up their economy rather than playing it safe.
#8. Really sorry to hear that. I hope they can trace and test all those who’ve been near to him.
"4 out of 7000 is really low. Kept us updated. I would also like to know the count from the red states. crazyH, seems like the warm states cases are rising while the cold states are going down."
"It would be great If Greece allowed ""low"" case US states...State by State basis....I am just still being hopeful for September!!"
"If you have gone through this testing procedure in Athens Airport yourself, or you happen to know someone who did. Please post a report on the venue.How well it was organized? How long did you wait for the result? Your personal insight?Your input shall be highly appreciated by many here.Thank you very much.Yuri."

"Absolutely Athens. Great thread. I'm sure we all need to keep our eye on these figures. If you don't have the time to update regularly, could you please me how I could get hold of this information myself.Thanks again"
"Maggie, you could sign up for news updates from Keep Talking Greece https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/or Greek Travel Pages - gtphttps://news.gtp.gr/"
"I’m not sure how a state by state basis would work in the US, as many people travel by road from their home state to another with an airport that has flights to their destination."
KatomeriKaf. I've got that newspaper and a couple of others on my favourites!! I must have missed the item. Many thanks for replying.
"State by State for the US will not be reliable.I live in a state that has a good record for handling the virus and is not on Greece's ""bad state"" list. The state I'm flying out of has a high rate of infection and is on the ""bad"" state list which will result in testing on arrival.That may change on July 1 when Greece makes a decision on allowing more countries into Greece.Not much more we can do until Greece makes the announcement on July 1."
"#12This is what a German tourist wrote on a German forum after flying in on Tuesday:""Hello, here are my experiences today when entering via Athens Airport:I started with Eurowings from Düsseldorf to Athens this morning.Checking in and boarding were very relaxed. All passengers were very disciplined, the flight was very quiet. A form then had to be filled in on the plane, which was then collected by the stewardesses.There was also no crowds when it came to baggage claim.We immediately went outside with the luggage, I have not seen any policemen or border guards who wanted to check anything - nobody was asked to do a corona test. Not even with accompanying Dutch or French.""The fact there was no random testing was probably because the flight came from an airport not listed on the EASA list. https:/…Airports"
"My understanding is that flights from non-EASA listed airports are subject to random testing and on EASA-listed flights 100% of passengers are tested so it's interesting that no one at that flight was tested. I have been wondering if arrival time plays a part in that random testing scheme. For example, are there still medical teams lurking at Athens airport ready to swab passengers arriving around midnight?"
Regarding state by state I also live in a state not listed on the bad list but an driving to a neighboring state to fly out which is on the bad list.Lots of us do it by this way because bigger cities equal cheaper flights and less connections
">>For example, are there still medical teams lurking at Athens airport ready to swab passengers arriving around midnight?<<That specific Eurowings flight leaves from Dusseldorf in the morning and arrives in Athens between 10.30 and 11AM so that shouldn't be a problem."
State by state rules in US in terms of traveling to Europe will never happen. Logistically not happening. Country by country is confusing enough!
"You can only think that the people testing positive have no idea that they are infected with the virus, nor are they feeling unwell.It does worry me in the bigger picture of things, with only random testing taking place. How many people are going off to their destinations wholly unaware of carrying the virus? I truly hope for Greece the number is minuscule, if any at all.Edited: 11:59 am, June 19, 2020 "
"If they are young and healthy - it can be as high as 97%. Poland has done mass screening (>80 000 tests) of coal mine workers which yielded over 6000 infected. Around 97% of the infected had no symptoms or only remember some mild symptoms when specifically asked, like having a sore throat for a day or two. They were normally going to work every day, only 5 or 7 of them have been admitted to hospital and they are not very ill either."
#29. I too wish only the very best for Greece and its population. Let’s hope the strength of the virus is significantly on the wain and Greece can welcome back many more tourists soon.
">>>but the concern is if they transmit the virus in the same strength within a ‘green’ country. Any views?There is no clarity on that as asymptomatic carriers usually escape testing and therefore it's hard to determine how many people they can infect. Logically, they are much less infectious than symptomatic people as they do not cough or sneeze so they can only infect people who are in close contact with them for a prolonged period of time. Since tourists tend to hang out in their own groups most of the time, I think the risk of virus transmission onto the locals is pretty low, especially this year with social distancing, etc. The problem for asymptomatic people will be that they will all be quarantined if tested, and that will be the end of their holiday."
#32. Thank you for the added insight. Makes good sense to me!!
"Just one update on the situation at Athens airport: I arrived this night at 1am on the last Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt. Greek authorities require you to fill out an arrivals form with your contact data on the plane (do not forget to bring a pen) which they collected directly after exiting the plane on the gangway. After that, it was possible to directly proceed to baggage claim and exit. No medical staff taking tests was present.I imagine that they take a risk-based approach and would probably not bother with flights from low infection countries..."
"Immortalis, thank you very much for your report. Enjoy your holiday!Yuri."
"Thanks for sharing your experience Immortalis,if you find time i'm sure it would also be helpful to others if you could give some details regarding the protocols on the plane.I'm assuming that different airlines will have their own set of protocols for boarding,in-flight do's and don'ts etc.but interested to hear how your own flight was handled."
"Hi Scaffolder! Indeed it was pretty much business as usual. The flight was fully booked, so they even offered me 100€ to fly the next day. Upon checkin, they start by blocking the middle seat, but that won‘t really help in the end if the airplane is full. At Frankfurt airport, things were pretty relaxed - no crowds, but also hardly any facilities (no shops / restaurants, lounges close at 4pm). Lufthansa was boarding by groups (as usual now) through the self boarding devices. They asked you to keep your distance as well as possible (which is not realisitic when boarding, though).On the plane, service was also standard, ie one drink service from the trolley + one (disgusting) sandwich. Business class passengers seemed to be receiving a full meal and enhanced drink service. Flight attendants were wearing gloves and masks and the service was a bit slower.Upon exiting the plane, no special protocols were enforced.Hope this helps!"
"Much appreciated Immortalis,it sounds that from your experience social distancing is far from being adhered to which is very worrying.Hope you manage to have a great holiday, and if you do get a few spare minutes here and there it would be interesting to hear how things are working out from a tourists point of view,perhaps a separate thread on your findings would be the best way so not to confuse issues with this thread."
I had doubts about social distancing being compatible with air travel and this seems to confirm them.
"Hi, My son arrived in Athens at the airport on 25 th June and is self isolating here in Chania. But he has not received his test results. Do you know how we can find them please? I have a phone number, but there is no reply, so it might be wrong? 21315 10932. Thanks for any help!"
You get only a message if tested positive.
So if you don’t hear anything after 24 hours from the time of your test you assume you are negative?
Where we can make covid-19 test on Athens airport if we are in transit?
Do you know what type of test it is. If it’s a swab test of the nose or throat?
