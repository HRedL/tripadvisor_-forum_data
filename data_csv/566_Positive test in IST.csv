"What exactly happens if someone does test positive after landing in IST? My question is purely hypothetical, with a healthy dose of paranoia. I will be getting tested prior to my flight because I have a connection to Croatia, but I will not have the results until after landing in IST. I tested negative a few days ago and have no symptoms, but my inner hypochondriac can't help but worry that somehow I will contract it at the worst possible time."
"As far as I read, if the person has positive result of C19 test - for Turkish citizen or resident, she / he will be transported to government hospital. For foreign tourist, the person will be referred to private hospital (this goes to the importance of having very good C19 insurance coverage)."
"I agree with Lanni. In all your travels these days you must have a very good travel insurance that covers fully Covid-19 hospitalization. Here is one insurance by Alliance: ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Insurance"". Recently, I got the info from an insurance broker friend of mine that private hospital bills for treatment of Covid-19 at private hospitals is running around 40,000 USD. enigma..."
40.000 USD that is a lot!Thanks for info from me too enigma. This information is very important to share especially for foreign tourists who plan to visit Turkey.
"It also depends, I would expect, on reciprocal arrangements with the country of origin of the visitor. Especially in the case of *some* EU countries, there are measures in place to treat each other's citizens much like their own; those would, I suppose, be entitled to nearly-free treatment at state hospitals, as usual.However, it is best to check this with your own consulate/embassy. In the case of the US, however, I can easily say that no reciprocal arrangement exists. But since $40K is the cost of having an ingrown fingernail removed in the US or something, I'm sure you'll find the cost of treatment remarkably low. ;)"
"Well a nose job is costing my friend Â£2000 + a covid test before the operation so yeah i think it will be much less than 40,000.I'm going on Sunday without insurance so I'll alert everyone to the procedures regarding arrivals."
Welcome back vip :-)
"170minrWhy anyone would travel abroad without travel or health insurance, during a pandemic is mindblowing.You're comparing a nose job procedure to potentially life saving treatment that requires REAL medical practitioners & serious hospital resources & machinary!!!Good luckEdited: 10:40 am, August 13, 2020 "
