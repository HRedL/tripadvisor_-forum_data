You might want to take a look at a recent thread on this topic: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18779…
"Some recent (as of today) - info https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/covid-19-i… Keep an eye for the new decree referenced in the articleOthers, I am sure will be along to say how it is there right now - You can also look at (during daylight hours in Italy) various live webcams - https:/…campo-de-fiori.htmlScroll down for other webcams around the city - There may also be even less crowds due to the weather being in the 90s (F) -"
"If you want my opinion, if two governments have nothing against people moving from each to other, it has to mean that the situation can't be really unsafe. Anyway, questions and answers about this topic are nowadays a fairly good number. You can find them in this forum.As a general impression, I can say - noting what I can read in these forums, about travelling to Italy from abroad, but also from Italy to other countries - that people who have not travelled yet have a much more anxious attitude than people that have already travelled.Most worries seem to belong to people who have not left their home yet, staying steadily exposed to press, TV and Internet. Those who ""dared"" to travel usually don't regret it at all, on the contrary. I can't remember any report like ""we shouldn't have gone, the fear of the virus spoilt all our time"" or ""so sad, the atmosphere there was so gloomy""."
"Many thanks, we're desperate to visit Rome and are certainly being swayed to travel."
Do you mean safe for you or save for Romans? It isn't clear.
Safe for everyone given the Covid-19 situation. I just wondered what people's experience has been like recently
"Currently in Rome, it is very safe.Masks worn to enter EVERY shop, restaurant, bar, museum and all forms public transport. Hand sanitisation everywhere.It's a mixed way to see Rome, much quieter than usual but this makes it easier.If you've booked for September do come you will enjoy it."
We are visiting Rome in a couple of weeks with my parents. Last minute change of plans. We were there for 6 nights last year and parents a few years back and love the city. May I ask is it less busy in general in the city as alot of tourists are on the 'red' list ie the states? If so it makes it easier for those that can visit I guess? Grazie mille.
"Personally I think that it is still too early to travel between different nations, situation is fluid and can change literally every day, at least until we will have a vaccine and a real cure.Anyway now the city is way less busy than usual in the centre and in touristic areas (except for the seaside, full of locals as in any summer), and it is funny that someone from UK ask for safety, given that italian media keep saying that epidemic situation in Great Britain is far worse than in Italy :)(I don't have any doubt that english media keep saying the absolute opposite :) )"
Poster #8: You can get some idea of people at some of the popular tourist spots in Rome here - https:/…fontana-di-trevi.html - scroll down for some other live webcams in the city It is super hot there now - temperatures in the 90s for this whole week so there may even be a bit less people out at the hottest times of the day - Rome is brutal in this sort of heat/humiditySome current information re: virus cases - https://www.ansa.it/english/news/2020/08/10/… - it is in English
"Hey giupep71Thanks for letting me know about how busy it is in rome. I dont think I did ask about safety? Rather how busy it is? We are a little further behind in the virus in the uk. We are worse than italy in terms of new daily cases but not worse than france and spain thats for sure! There are far worse european countries than us with regards to the number of daily new cases! Also worth noting the area I come from in England is relatively low with regard new cases. Uk certainly not on a par with the states!Edited: 10:46 am, August 11, 2020 "
Hey Mcat....oh heck dont we know about the heat in italy! We were there last june when a heatwave hit Italy. 40 degree heat is not fun for sightseeing! Luckily we had a pool in our hotel to cool off with. Thank you for the camera tips. Much appreciated.
"Hi ClairandChris!Obviously I was talking about the OP. :)Anyway, as I wrote, Rome centre and touristic areas aren't busy at all. But MCat is right, heat is almost unbearable now, hope that in a couple of weeks situation will improve!"
Ha ha! Thanks giupe71!
