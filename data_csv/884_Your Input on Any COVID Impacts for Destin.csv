"Hi all - My fiancée and I are thinking about booking a week stay in Destin in two weeks and are curious if we should know about any COVID impacts.I’ve been doing a lot of research and do not see much except wear a mask and restaurants operating at 50% (with bars closed unless 50% or more revenue comes from food). Are most or all restaurants doing reservations and social distancing? I’m curious how popular places like Donut Hole and McGuires are avoiding long lines and crowds of people waiting around. We would like to hit some hot spots as my fiancée has never been to Destin, but not if we are packed around others. Otherwise, we will get a condo and relax. We live in Texas and have been staying home since March and looking for a quick getaway."
"Also, I spoke to someone who runs a beach service today. He said beaches are packed and restaurants are slammed - not operating at 50% or social distancing. He said they are busier than ever since everyone is going to the beach due to limitations on where to travel. Has this been anyone’s experience?"
We were in the area in June and everything was packed. I can't speak to how it is now but assume that it would be about the same. We did go to McGuire's and everything there seemed like business as usual with hordes of people crowded outside waiting for a table.
I live a few counties east in the Forgotten Coast. We have had record tourism since May. The week before Memorial Day I went in a restaurant and it was packed with absolutely no social distancing. I have not been to another restaurant since as the parking lots are packed. I have not been to Destin but am commenting because our beaches are no where as popular as Destin. I would not expect smaller crowds in Destin - especially since school start dates are now delayed. I am certain that people are wearing masks in some public venues but don’t expect people to be wearing masks outdoors or social distancing on the beach (this is no longer enforced as the state mandate on crowds in outdoor spaces has expired). You have decide for yourself what you’re willing to expose yourself to. I personally believe that being outside- especially on the beach- is very safe. The Panhandle does not have the restrictions imposed in South Florida- bars are closed throughout the state but you can enjoy an adult beverage in a restaurant. Grocery stores are requiring masks and some stores. It’s impossible for a state that depends on revenue from tourism to be excessively restrictive.
"Okaloosa is less crowded than Destin. We just spent 2 weeks there. Went into Destin a few times to dive/eat. McGuires was packed at 5. We had a 25 min wait for outside dining on their upstairs balcony. We only ate at places that had outside dining or carryout. Dewey Destin, Crab Island location, had built a large outside dining area. We always went at lunch time with no wait. We discovered Harbor Tavern. A new place with excellent food, outside dining and very handy after getting off the dive boat."
"There is very minimal effort to be safe in Destin. Very few masks, beaches are maybe not quite as crowded, but it's hard to tell because of the double red flags this week. A lot of the restaurants aren't letting you order takeout after they get busy during dinner. We tried Dewey's, Lagniappe, Cpt. Dave's today between 5 and 5:30 before giving up and finishing our leftovers from Mellow Mushroom the night before. (posting this a couple of times just so people know)"
We were in Miramar Beach 7/10-7/19. We ate lunch out when we first arrived and that was it. We did carry out or ate in the rest of the week. No social distancing no employees wearing masks in restaurants (in the 4 that we observed).
"Just reading this thread ie; places are packed, no social distancing, no masks, restaurant employees. It wearing masks and people standing around etc. I guess there’s no wondering why Florida is in the state it’s in. Pathetic!"
Cases are decreasing in Florida:https:/…new-cases-50-states
"I hope so, Jay, but if you drill in a bit you'll see that Sunday and Monday numbers are almost always lower than the prior few days"
"Well it is still early, but the 7-day averages are also trending down."
Hoping like heck that this continues!
Destin is in Okaloosa County and the county is setting records every day for this virus! Ninety five new cases and 2 more deaths today! Please plan your vacation wisely.
Walton County Emergency Management on facebook posts positive - negative numbers. Also hospital beds numbers etc. for Walton County (from Miramar Beach to 30A area)
The 7 day average number of deaths is not trending down.
"Great info for Walton County, MBL- it’s refreshing to see factual information free of irrational fear porn! The Okaloosa County information is posted on Niceville.com. The virus is real, however much of the data being reported is not, particularly without any context, and those charts fortunately provide some context. Destin had 8 new “cases“ reported yesterday (of the 95 new “cases” in Okaloosa County). There were 2 deaths in Okaloosa County, which has a population of around 200,000 that swells to close to 250,000 in the summer - this may allow for some perspective. The median age of positives is 38. Half of all COVID deaths are from Nursing Home patients. If you’re under 65 (85% of Americans are under 65), your chance of dying from COVID 19 is the same as dying while driving to work (from Prof. John Ioannidis, Stanford). I place “cases” in quotes because there is a high false positive rate AND a high false negative rate, rendering “cases” as essentially valueless information. The increase in testing we started seeing here as businesses started opening was because many businesses use CDC Guidelines for when employees are sick. The guidelines recommended having the employees tested if they have any of the laundry list of symptoms associated with COVID, and if they were positive, they then required 2 negative tests in a row less than 24 hours apart prior to returning to work. Many tests obtained are from the same employees obtaining multiple tests while awaiting return to employment. The median age of positives dropping from 54 to 38 is a reflection of a massive increase of employees getting tested. Last week CDC (perhaps in recognition that testing is essentially meaningless information because of the high false positive and negative rates, along with the inability to report the tests in a timely fashion because of the increase in demand for tests so people could return to work) changed their guidance from testing to a symptom based algorithm for returning to work. This will start to lessen the demand for testing in the next couple of weeks as businesses learn of the new guidelines and start implementing the symptom based algorithm, which will then lessen the number of “cases“, which then will be attributed to masks working. The new “cases” are not necessarily new infections. They are counting every test that is positive (even if it’s from the same person who is obtaining multiple tests while awaiting 2 negatives in a row prior to returning to work) as new “cases”. They are also counting positive Antibody tests (which could have been an infection at any point in time in the last several months) as new “cases“. Local hospitals have some nursing home patients who have recovered from COVID and no longer meet the need for hospitalization anymore, but have no place to be discharged until they test negative, so they are just “hoteling” them right now, and since our hospitals have the capacity to allow for that, that’s considered best practice. New York infamously discharged patients who no longer needed hospitalization back to the nursing homes, and we know how that turned out."
Just to keep the number straight there have been 24 deaths in Okaloosa County since March 1. Only 5 of those were in Long Term Care.
"I meant to say also that the 2 deaths reported yesterday were from several weeks ago from a long term care facility, but just reported yesterday. It’s called Legacy Data Laundering."
"From Destin Log today:“The fatalities in Okaloosa included a 96-year-old man diagnosed July 9 and an 82-year-old man diagnosed June 30. Both were long term care facility residents who passed away earlier in the month and were not reported to the DOH in a timely manner, according to Okaloosa Director of Public Safety Patrick Maddox.“"
we are all adults here --post your fear porn some where else --post a link if you are going to spout off numbers
"Porn fear? Not sure what that is. We are talking about Covid-19https:/…4915657158ed4991817d3703107563baEdited: 10:13 pm, July 30, 2020 "
"I am here right now, leaving tomorrow. We rented a town house (Green Reef town houses) and each town house has its own private beach, just a little slice of sand. It’s enough space to be completely away from others. Looking down the beach at the public beaches and condo/neighborhood beaches...they are four to five umbrellas deep and there are so many people in the water that I can’t see how it would be possible to relax. We have ordered from door dash, had groceries delivered and have cooked at our place. We haven’t gone to any restaurants except one night we walked to Captain Dave’s to get a to go order at 4:30. No one takes reservations. Many places don’t require masks. Take out from popular restaurants stops around 5:00. The way people are acting, it’s like Covid doesn’t exist here. So if you want to be safe, find a place where the owners own the sand all the way to the water. If not, you will be packed in with everyone else. Yesterday we had a huge group come down from one of the public beaches (walked along the beach) and try to set up next to us, not even six ft away. Security had them move. So they moved to the house next to us which was also private and the people there said it was private, so they moved to ANOTHER private part of the beach. That’s where they stayed because no one was staying at that house. I’d suggest wherever you stay, make sure there’s security or you will be dealing with people who paid a third of what you paid to set up on your private beach space. The trip can be done safely but not if you are staying at a huge complex.I’ve also read that Henderson beach state park is at 50% capacity and people go there when their beaches are crowded. $6 a vehicle and get there early or you might not get in. It’s big enough that everyone can spread out."

"How many have died from TB, David?How many from Covid?Reasons to be fearful of both."
"the TB cost over a million to treat -will take down a healthy person in their prime --the covid will generally take out those with existing conditions. So if YOU are ""fearful"" -please dont be a hypocrite and dispose of your own trash --do not call or expect law/fire/EMS or other services ---dont expect what you consider peons to show up to work at amazon /wal mart etc. so you can ""be safe in your car"" -I love that term --in my career as a fireman , I believe the most dead I ""encountered"" were in their car. ""Safe at home"" a close second"
