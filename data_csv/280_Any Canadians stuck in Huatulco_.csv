You can still get flights if you go via Mexico City and VAncouver on Mar. 20th. I would get on it as there won't be a way home soon.
No flights with WJ out of HUX to Canada available.
"This must be a really odd situation to be in. Part of me thinks, well, I'm retired, nothing at home I'd have to get back to, can afford to live the beach bum lifestyle a while longer, I'll just make the best of it. But realistically, we know what's going to happen to ALL the borders -- it's only going to get harder to get home. Good luck to Brad H. and anyone else this is happening to. Let us know how you fare?"
"Have you tried dealing direct with WestJet? I believe both WestJet and Sunwing are in ""recovery"" mode where they are sending down empty planes to return stranded guests. There was also some suggestion by Sunwing anyway that they were helping each other out. Also, I believe now the international flights are being limited to landing in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal."
"3.18 update: The US/Canadian border is shutting down now.These closures are increasing rapidly, and anticipated lengths of closure appear to be extending as we hear more and more.IMO, anybody not willing to spend the next few months in Huatulco should be bugging out asap."
"I see Transat has announced a gradual shutdown of service. May be opportunities to fly back with them. If you are at a resort they usually have a rep from Sunwing, Transat, and WestJet on site to talk to. That said, they tend to be contract employees, not employees of the charter airlines."
"The chartes were't limited to the 4 airports listed from Mexcio, but they are cancelling their flights as of the 22nd for WJ and SW and Transat are gradually suspending them. I would take whatever you can get now and get home."
"Saw this information on CBC about travelers from Canada stranded abroad.""Eligible Canadians now outside Canada and needing help to return home can contact the nearest Government of Canada office or Global Affairs Canada's 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at +1 613-996-8885 (collect calls are accepted where available), or they can email sos@international.gc.ca."
"We know many Canadians and Americans that will be staying here in Huatulco for the next few months.CHEdited: 8:33 pm, March 18, 2020 "
CasaHoffa. What's your point?
"You may want to get in touch with a local Sunwing rep. They just announced that they will offer free seats after they have accommodated all their customers on their remaining flights. The instruction was to show up at the airport 3 hours before departure, and they will give you a seat if there are any left over."
"K & L,Unfortunately, you are not here to experience how folks are coming together to help Huatulco become a safe haven. At this moment there is little hoarding with plenty of available basic foods and medicines (and TP!), people are respectfully practicing ""social distancing"" (in most cases), and the weather continues to be HOT with increasing humidity. We know folks from the US and Canada that have decided that they would rather be here than ""there"" and do not feel ""stuck in Huatulco"".CHEdited: 8:08 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Ahh but I am here. Haven't seen social distancing from my perspective although I noticed Chedruai is out of hand sanitizer and staff are wearing masks.
Every single Canadian I have spoken to today said they are leaving by Sunday at the latest. I guess we run in different social circles.
"“I guess we run in different social circles.”Perhaps so, K&L. Come Monday, we’ll give a report on the number of Canadians (and Americans) that we see or know who are still here in Huatulco as well as an update on the availability of basics.Yes, we did notice a lack of hand sanitizers too. But there is plenty of soap and bleach and alcohol stocked on the shelves and folks are making their own.CHEdited: 10:30 am, March 20, 2020 "
"Yes CH- staying because Huatulco is their winter home so why not hunker down and wait this out at home instead of travelling? The question was specifically directed towards people whose flights were cancelled, wasn’t it?"
"Hi Maria.Huatulco is more than our ""winter home"". We are permanent residents and are here more than we are in NYC.CHEdited: 12:26 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"So you see my point? And good for you. I’m happy for you and your husband. I hope you and all the Huatulqueños stay healthy for the duration. Again- I think the whole point of this thread was for people on vacation whose flights home had been cancelled, not people who live full time or part time in Huatulco."
""".....I think the whole point of this thread was for people on vacation whose flights home had been cancelled...""Again, Maria, we know Canadians and Americans alike who normally would be returning north that have decided to stay here in Huatulco because of the conditions up north. To some extent, these forums have helped with those decisions.Be well, stay safe, and good luck to all of you no matter where you may be.CHEdited: 3:58 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"""NO"" Health Insurance as of The 23rd of March. That should be reason enough to get back to your own Country!"
"This is not going to blow over. :(. If you can get a flight, get a flight!"
CasaHoffa- I think your idea to hunker down in Huatulco might very well be a good idea given the state of things in New York. It's horrible to see and I wish Governor Cuomo and the rest of New York the best of a very bad situation.
"Flew out of HUX to YVR, via MEX, on the 27th. it was our original booking dates.Stayed at YVR overnight and flew home yesterday. Tried to get flights home earlier as we were getting nervous.It all worked out, thanks Aeromexico for keeping us reasonably informed( can't say the same for some other carrier). Nice to be home, 2 weeks self isolation."
HelloMost all ambassadors are instructing their citizens to get out of Mexico. Resort towns and villages may be paralyzed as the focus will be prioritized to the heavy populated cities.Stay safe Regards
my friend is stuck in Huatulco and we don't get up to date information- are there airlines that are going to start flying to Canada in June
Aeromexico is supposed to start flying to Canada this month.
We know three who flee back to Canada a few days ago through Mexico City. They arrived safely and are now home in quarantine.CH
