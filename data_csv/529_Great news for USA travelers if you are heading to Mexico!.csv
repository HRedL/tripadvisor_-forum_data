"Travelers returning from a trip outside the country or their state no longer face recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to self-quarantine for 14 days upon return. The CDC updated its travel requirements online Friday, advising travelers to ""follow state, territorial, tribal and local recommendations or requirements after travel."" Previous guidelines recommended a 14-day quarantine for those returning from international destinations or areas with a high concentration of coronavirus cases."
"LOL, certainly didn't like having to face a ""recommendation"". We've now been upgraded to just a raised eyebrow. That certainly is great news."
"Thinking that if I have any chance at the end of Oct trip, we may have to discuss dropping Las Brisas for a more isolated property like the Marea beachfront villas.Much easier implementation of covid watchdog rules et al.Have been wanting to give them a try for awhile now anyway.Keith"
"A VRBO/AirBnB would suit your needs as well. We are thinking about fishing more, since the normal morning stroll through the market, shopping will be a no this time. Can fish every day, then just relax at the beach all afternoon. Will be a MUCH slower pace trip than normal, but I still want to go and support their economy as much as safely possible."
"Not having to worry about elevators would be a huge help. Still worry about the airport and planes, however."
"Hey Flatlander, could you provide the link for that info? I looked on CDC’s website, couldn’t find anything. Thanks."
"Playamomma, I heard it on the radio today; don't know anything about a link to the CDC website. Safe travels. ¡Diviertanse!"
"Copied from the cdc page, about halfway down under 'Check Travel Restrictions' :Check Travel RestrictionsState, local, and territorial governments may have travel restrictions in place, including testing requirements, stay-at-home orders, and quarantine requirements upon arrival. Follow state, local, and territorial travel restrictions. For up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state, territorial, tribal and local health department where you are, along your route, and where you are going. Prepare to be flexible during your trip as restrictions and policies may change during your travel.Link to the entire page:https:/…In essence, the cdc is deferring to local and/or state authorities."

"It's looking more and more like I won't be able to travel from Canada to anywhere this winter.....not really anything to do with flights or national laws regarding quarantine, but that my company is making anyone coming home from somewhere out of Canada self-isolate for 14 days. So, since I won't take two extra weeks off after a 1 or 2 week vacation, I'm SOL.It's possible that might change come January or later, but if Mexico still has sooooo many cases it will likely still be on the list of 'no-travel without a quarantine once home' places. In that case we will just go to Europe, or somewhere else with a low number of cases.It's going to be so hard getting through one of our harsh winters without at least one one-week escape to warmer climes, when we usually do 2-3 weeks/two trips over the winter. (Talk about First World problems though, I feel guilty even saying that out loud, so I am not gonna whine.)still crossing my fingers for a vaccine- and only one that's gone through the required testing, so that might be awhile."
And this is yet another reason why the U.S. leads the world in COVID-19 infections and deaths. SMH...
