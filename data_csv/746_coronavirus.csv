anyone at couples resorts cancelling
You really needed a new thread for this question? Seriously? The other dozen threads aren't enough? What does Couples have to do with anything?
"And they have multiple FB groups.Observation: Since this ""crisis"" I have seen a huge uptick in TA sign-ups and postings. If you look through the 10,000 corona virus threads on this forum alone (can't even imagine what's going on on the Europe forums) you too will see posters with 1, 2 or 3 posts all on the same thread."
and every single one of these gratuitous threads is named ‘coronavirus.’ nothing to differentiate this thread from the dozens of other gratuitous ‘coronavirus’ threads.
Canceling a trip as a personal decision. If your airport is open and your destination is accepting visitorsIt’s an airborne diseaseIn going on any trips at any point moving forward ; you have to consider that you may not be allowed to go home at any point in the future. Things are changing world wide daily PEACE!
"It is NOT airborne! Wish people would stop posting inaccurate information. It spreads from direct p2p contact, or in droplets from coughing or sneezing (within 6' radius). That is emphatically NOT airborne. Airborne viruses can infect an entire room if an infected person is present. That's very different."
Too early to say that it's absolutely not airborne ...https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110…
TM-Case discussed this morning -everyone in the room tested positive. PEACE!
DR's are now saying it IS airborne and can stay active for at least three hours . It can also survive on money an other materials for days .
All schools now on shut down for 14 days with effect from tomorrow (Friday 13th).
"BG; I'm not sure what to say. The CDC and several other sources says it's not, but it is a new virus so maybe. Definitely following."
"""It can also survive on money an other materials for days""Per Stanford University it hangs out on metal and fabric for up to 12 hours."
"dawnyg17, where is the ""All"" in your post #9? Is it Cambridge, is it all of the UK, is it Runaway Bay, is it all of Jamaica?Edited: 12:36 am, March 14, 2020 "
"BG: just coming back to take my licks. I have been reading and watching interviews, and the current consensus is that it is airborne. So I was wrong."
"One other thing, studies now show it can infect people up to 15 feet away and can live on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours. More than one study now shows that wearing a mask does help people from getting it when in public. Hope everyone stays healthy, especially all Jamaicans."
"CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. You should only wear a mask if a healthcare professional recommends it. A facemask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms. This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. The use of facemasks also is crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility)."
"Sort of. A properly fitted n95 respirator (not your standard surgical mask, those are useless) will definitely work, but you have to cover your eyes as well."
"""CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.

I just saw a Facebook post by a foreigner SELLING N95 masks for 1000JMD. I was told that they are being sold on eBay for $100US. FOR NOTHING.And a surgical mask for prevention of disease (the APPRORPIATE disease) works just as well as an N95 mask. I have a stash of N95 masks to wear during fire season to prevent the particulate from the ash and burning wires from entering my lungs."
