Hi!!Ok I need everyones personal opinion here... I have flights booked to go to Vietnam in February. But with the out break of corona virus alot of us are now contemplating the trip. We are flying to Korea as our connecting flight from Canada and will be flying into Danang and traveling through some citues south on the way to HCM. WHat would you do in this situation? Would you still go or cancel the trip? Thanks!!!
"No need to cancel, but avoid crowds as much as possible and crowded places (HCMC especially!) Spend time in our smaller cities - Dalat, Quy Nhon, Ninh Binh. Bring a good mask but a healthy young person has little to worry about (the very young and very old are the ones who should avoid travel). I would not spend much time in Danang, Hoi An or Nha Trang - places crowded with Chinese tourists."
It is a little early to forecast how much this virus will spread but i believe it is in 7 countries already so it is difficult to answer your question.
Well the virus is here with at least 2 confirmed cases. Would be a pity to cancel but if it starts spreading more in the next weeks maybe best to cancel.
"Pay attention to what the real experts at WHO,CDC and your own national government travel advisory sites tell you.Do not take uninformed ""advice"" or ""opinions"" from self-professed communicable disease ""experts"" on sites such as this.Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad@ Phnom Penh"
"If you are concerned about it, stay at home and don't travel"
"""Do not take uninformed ""advice"" or ""opinions"" from self-professed communicable disease ""experts"" on sites such as this.""Better still, don't ask the question of such people.Unless you're just hoping to hear what you want to hear.Which is not always great....Anyway, uninformed / ignorant / blase, I'd go travel.Something will always get you in the end, anyway. ;-)Scott"
"At the moment I would be more concerned about Dengue (70.000 cases), Malaria (4.500) or traffic death (8.500), just to rank some risks. It reminds me to the situation with H5N1 and SARS, I've been traveling during this times. Of course, be informed and watch out the news on WHO."
"Well 3 cases in Australia and 2 in Vietnam tells me Vietnam is safer than Australia. Just ho and enjoy your holiday, Vietnam have very good procedures in place."
"We are due to go end of Feb/early March.Unless they tell us we can't go, life goes on. Wear a mask if you feel happy, stay away from live animal markets/food places. Wash your hands and take antibacterial wipes to use on surfaces and items"
"I am still planning to go end of February. Over 3,000 influenza deaths in the US this year and most people won’t get a simple vaccine but everyone freaks out about a handful of deaths from coronavirus. Unless this thing totally explodes I would just go and have a good time. There are many more deadly infections you can get that you aren’t currently worried about (and shouldn’t be)."
This is what the Vietnamese authorities have put in place to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.https:/…435460.html
"You might find, if things get much worse, that flights start to get cancelled. Or governments might decide to call time. I see Vietnam Airlines (and others) have offered to refund Vietnam-China flight tickets if customers want to cancel https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/compan… . As usual, all you and I can do is be guided by the health experts. FWIW, I don't count myself as one.btw I see Netflix has a series on Pandemics running at the moment. Makes for interesting viewing. https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment…Edited: 11:00 am, January 26, 2020 "
We are travelling to Hanoi on the 14th of February. We are just going to use masks in crowded places. So far there are only two isolated cases in Hanoi and they are Chinese citizens. We are just keeping an eye on Govt websites for updates.

> So far there are only two isolated cases in Hanoi and they are Chinese citizens. We are just keeping an eye on Govt websites for updates.https:/…52730.htmlDoesn't say confirmed...
I would be more worried with what they are not telling you. You can not make an informed decision if most of the information from China is censored.
I have a Spartan Race on the 15th of Feb in HCMC. I am monitoring things here in the Philippines.
"We flew out of Hanoi last night and practically everyone without exception was wearing a mask at the airport, including all staff. Cabin crew wore masks throughout our flight. Arrived in Heathrow and if you were wearing a mask you were the odd one out. It's definitely worth buying a good quality medical grade mask if you are travelling."
I'm due to fly with my husband to Cambodia and Vietnam end Feb. I am extremely nervous as I do have existing health problems and fall into the age bracket of most that have sadly died. My anxiety has taken over my life right now and although I'm following WHO advice my mind is almost made up to cancel at a huge financial loss... My heart really wants to go but my head is saying no.
"> I'm due to fly with my husband to Cambodia and Vietnam end FebThings will be a bit clearer by then. I'd just not make any decision yet. Possibly you will be fine to go. Possibly the government will advise against travel to the region in which case your travel insurance might cover your costs. Possibly it'll be worse than that.If you have a cancellation window on accommodation, you could consider cancelling while it's still free to cancel. Easy enough to book again if you do end up going.But nobody knows what the situation will be by then. Least of all people on here."
"We are booked to head to Vietnam for 3 month holiday on Match 10. No consideration at cancelling, just monitoring situation , take reasonable precautions and getting face masks for the trip Early (expect supply problem to occur!) . Just as much danger here in Australia it seems from tourists . We are still going to enjoy our first time in Vietnam !"
"Lucky you Greg 3 months is a great holiday I hope you love it as much as we do.Annie,"
"I have an 18 day trip planned from north to south Vietnam and Cambodia, flying out on the 2nd Feb. My other half and I are 28/29 so I appreciate the risk is lower, but until we are explicitly told not to go by the UK government or the WHO I do not see why you would cancel.The actual figures and % of contraction, never mind serious illness, is so low. The statistical likelihood at the minute is that we are much more likely to be struck down by a multitude of other misfortunes rather than coronavirus.If you take plenty of cold medication and take the necessary hygiene precautions, I cannot see why you would rush to cancel the whole trip at this stage when no government is advising against Vietnam travel."
"As of 1/27, Canada has a confirmed acase and more are expected. The US has 5 confirmed cases, Japan and S. Korea has 4 confirmed cases each. Vietnam has 2 confirmed cases. There are other much higher risks to worry about in Vietnam than this. I also have plan to go there in a couple of weeks.Edited: 6:37 am, January 27, 2020 "
"I am in the same situation. Leaving for Vietnam via Hong Kong next week. If I could get a refund on tour and flight, I wouldn’t go. Staying out of crowded areas is pretty hard. Also, what if I get sick there, would insurance cover my costs. The screening delays at airports. And then returning home. Not worried about catching anything, but more the logistics."
https:/… 12 quarantined in Danang with high fevers
Check what’s happen in the next days before to decide. I m in Vn now
"Not sure how much to wait... I leave Feb 5th. This is what I was fearing. I will be travelling to Danang and all the hotspots, crowded areas of Vietnam, markets. Flying often. How relaxing will it be? Again, it’s not about catching this virus, it’s about worrying every time I feel ill or having to go through security. And where do you go for quarantine? Who pays? Calling my insurance company and travel group. Then my airlines to see about options. Chinese tourists from Wuhan are already there."
"I was just in vietnam in mid january (nga trang) and it was filled with chinese tourist. The airport and city I was in was filled with chinese nationals. so I would say as long as the country or the area you are going to is not allowing chinese citizens who might potentially be infected (incubation period is 2 weeks), then you are fine.BUT the problem is Vietnam is still allowing chinese nationals to enter I think? so anywhere with chinese nationals is a risk unfortunately. unless you are going to an area with not many chinese nationalsI really would avoid flying or travelling at this moment just because I don't want to put myself at risk until more information is found out about this virusEdited: 10:25 am, January 27, 2020 "
Preach.

ich habe ein Flug am 3. Februar mit meinen Sohn und meinen Mann nach Vietnam gebucht. Wir fliegen trotzdem.kenne noch einige Leute die demnächst nach Mianmar und Thailand fliegen. Denke dass wird schon gut gehen.Mir ist nicht bekannt dass in Vietnam Fälle gemeldet worden sind.Viel Glück uns allen und trotzdem gute Zeit dort.
"From moh.gov.vn (Ministry of Health):Vietnam:+ Number of infected cases: 2 cases were positive for NCoV.These are two Chinese patients, of which, LiZing patient (66 years old, father) and wife from Wuhan to Vietnam to visit her son, LiChao (28 years old) living and working in Long An. These two Chinese father and son were confirmed positive for NCoV and were isolated and treated at the hospital.+ Number of deaths: 0+ Number of suspected cases: 63 cases had symptoms of fever and had a history of going back from the epidemic area, of which 25 cases were excluded due to infection with other agents.+ Number of tracking cases: 38 cases are closely isolated to avoid spreading to the community."
Coronavirus experts answer what happens when infected and who is more likely to be in danger:abc.net.au/news/…
Yes.... There are so many people in the U.S. that are unwilling to get the flu vaccine. It's really frustrating.
I just read danang had 2 chinese from wahun provide wuth signs of virus and they are expecting 93 still up to the 30th Jan .We are looking at another holiday for us and we're not going until July. But cases are building world wide .10 to v 16 days Inc. Time before virus shows .sorry answer no don't go although I luv luv luv Vietnam and Thailand in June we are still going but will monitor
Thanks Annie - am sure we will. At least we are getting in for a solid 3 months before they change the visa rules 1 July .
"""I am curious if any of the handful of people in this forum who truly know what they are talking about have any up-to-date Intel.""Yes, a little, Mike.Waiting to see if it actually goes ahead, as don't really want to add more confusion to the already rather confusing visa situation.Scott"
"> I am curious if any of the handful of people in this forum who truly know what they are talking about have any up-to-date Intel.Not sure I would claim to be in that select band.We now have a good English translation of 51/2019/QH14: asemconnectvietnam.gov.vn/law.aspx…> This Law comes into force from July 1, 2020.(The English version actually says July 10, but it's wrong.)> 13. Amendments to Clause 1 Article 31 as follows:> ... in case his/her visa is encoded as DL and valid for more than 30 days, he/she shall be granted temporary residence for 30 days and shall be considered for extension of temporary residence as specified in Article 35 of this Law;So extensions possible, but whether they'll start refusing them for people who stay long term on a tourist visa or not we don't know. Similarly for how simple the process will be. Or what it might cost.The 30 day blackout between visa waiver visits has been removed (which is good) so all these UK TUI people who want to go to Siem Reap can just do two visa waiver visits as of 1st July. And presumably UK cruisers can have visa free days ashore.The removal of the 30 day black out seems to favour 'proper' tourists many of whom want to visit Cambodia and return.The limit of 30 days at a time for tourists seems to be designed to inconvenience long term residents doing visa runs.I'm guessing foreign tour companies lobbied for the former and maybe the Vietnamese government tossed in the latter as way to discourage people who probably don't have a very high daily spend and might be there for social evils.I'm watching the London Embassy's pages to see if they update their guidance. No sign yet. But they're usually a little last minute with these things. And nothing on IATA TimaticWeb"
"""Of course you are, along with Scott.""Nah, Manat is. Not me. My eyes glaze over when I try to read stuff like in Manat's link. :-(""I would also like to hear from the ex-pat regulars....""DP is another one, too.Sent you a PM. Not that I have too much information on the subject.Scott"
"i am planning to go to Nha Trang on 29 March to 01 April with my 4 years old twins. As long as there is no any update from our country not to travel oversea, then we will just proceed and take extra precaution by bringing the antibacterial wipes & spray. Anyway, Malaysia have 4 confirm cases while Vietnam have only 2. so i assume Vietnam is safer. huhu. just take extra care, hope everything would be just fine."
"Hello,I’m right now in Da Nang, Vietnam. Here are many tourists and all the inhabitants are calm. BUT there are 12 people unter quarantine in the hospital. And here are also 166 Chinese tourists from Wuhan. I found this information on a vietnamese neues side. I’m thinking about canceling my trip too and flying back to Europe.https:/…52719.htmlhttps:/…"
"We arrived in Da Nang a week ago and celebrated Lunar Tet in Hoi An and are here till 31/01 the off to Nha Trang. We have 3 months travelling through Vietnam and are 4 weeks in to it. There has been 12 cases in Da Nang so far, lots of Chinese are wearing masks as well as many other nationalities, the plus side of this is if they have the virus they are containIng it. We have steered clear of airports and are using luxury sleeper buses with your own cabin, little bit more expensive but far more comfortable and far less people than the usual sleeper buses. We use probiotics At home and take them everywhere, take the usual anti bacterial gel and wipes ( part of a first aid kit), and keep an eye on what your Government are saying about travelling. A plus is by the time you arrive a lot of the tourist will have flown home after the New Year holidays which will give a better perspective of cases in each area. Vietnam is a wonderful place, have a great holiday you won’t be disappointed."
"Hi Jenn, we are still in Vietnam and will be till end of Ferburary. I think it is safe here we are not staying in the big crowded cities (if we staying we are not going to crowded places). The worst thing is that now during the New luna year holiday people are traveling around the country and back home so they can spread. But in Ferburary it's gonna be better. :) Just have in mind to wash your hand more often than usualy and dont put your fingers in to your eyes or nose. So dont worry you'll be fine.;)) T."
"We head over in 2 weeks. At this stage we still going. Just watching the reports and looking at alternative news like aljazeera for accurate updates. China has been watering down the information to the outside and our government and immigration is pretty much last from the gate, so only time will tell how bad it gets. There are varying strains of the virus now and the effects can vary from headaches and lethargy to death in the weak and older.The 2 cases in Vietnam have been contained, but with up to 2 weeks of incubation who knows how many cases will come up over the next 2 weeks."
"We also have flights going to Thailand layover in China in February. We cancelled ours today. I rather be safe than sorry. The likelihood of it becoming an epidemic is high. The number is rising, it’s safe to avoid crowds, especially Asia right now."
"We’re in Viet Nam now and haven’t even thought about it much. There are several people from China quarantined in Da Nang, which is where we’re right now. I wouldn’t cancel. Wash your hands often is my only advice."
We’re in Viet Nam right now. We’re waiting at the Da Nang airport for a friend then we head to Hoi An. I wouldn’t cancel. My only advice is wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. Enjoy your trip!
"Practice good hygiene. Wash hands often with soap or use gel to kill germs. I just spend 4 days in Da Nang, now on my way to Cat Ba, then Hanoi and Sapa. Lots of people wear masks. The weather just turned cold so bring jacket and long sleeve shirts, long pants to stay warm. Happy Travels."
Im a new zealander currently in Nepal. Arrived 3 days before news of the outbreak which was unfortunate for me. Travelling to vietnam next via guangzhou. will be in vietnam for 3 weeks before heading back to nz. Im cancelling vietnam and booking a flight straight back to nz asap. The trip can happen another time when its safe. im not about to risk my life no way. money means nothing if i die.
Hi. we are in the same situation. we will leave for Vietnam next week and I follow the news and WHO. but I'm still worried. I don't know whether we need a mask or not and could we visitplaces of interest

"Cancel the trip. There are other places less affected by this virus. Some Chinese have already arrived and travelled through Vietnam, potentially spreading the disease."
I have cancelled mine. There is too much risk as many Chinese people have arrived and are travelling through Vietnam.
I use to live in Vietnam and also wanted to go back. Don't do it to yourself you. Vietnam is touristy and you will meet a lot of people from every. My problem is people identify only the Chinese people.... What about the others that came I contact with others without realizing it. Rather not go
We are travelling on 31st January 2020. Looking at all the posts and news going around wondering if we should cancel our plans.
Two confirmed cases seems too low considering how close vietnam is to China and the ease of touring through the borders. Countries across the oceans have more confirmed cases.
The two areas of Vietnam that have package holiday flights directly from China are Nha Trang and Danang which of course includes visits to Hoi An 35klm away.The Chinese package tourists dont stray far from their destination and travel on their own package tour buses.So if it concerns you just avoid those two destinations.
"Have been in Hoi An 2 month every last 10 years. Love this city and people. Our plan is to go there in Marc. But this time I am vorry because of the Corona virus. There are crowded with people from China and Corea at this place. And the health care is not good in Vietnam. Last time we were there a family father drowned. From the ambulance was called it took almost 50 minutes before it was there. Sorry, too late."
"Masks wont prevent you from getting the virus - they are really just effective to stop the spread (ie if you have it).For those from countries such as Australia and USA cancelling trips to Vietnam... well Aus and USA have more cases of Coronavirus than Vietnam,... so what do you do at home? Stay indoors?"
"We are going to Vietnam middle March. My concern isn't about contracting the virus (I'm reasonably fit and healthy) but I am scared that they will put travel restrictions in place and that we won't be able to go - this will break my heart, because I've always dreamt of going to Vietnam. What are the chances of this happening?"
> What are the chances of this happening?Nobody has a clue. But you should have travel insurance that covers your losses in that case.
"We are leaving on 2/8 to Vietnam and Cambodia, traveling via Tokyo. My husband and I have no plans to cancel. As with any flu, take precautions. We wash our hands and I am bringing travel sized packets of wipes. I will bring face masks for indoor places that are crowded. We have more cases of flu in the U.S."
Me travelling from 2nd to 7th..
"Traveling from 8th Feb to 20th Feb. Have not cancelled yet but keeping that option open, just in case.Currently Vietnam is not looking that bad"
I am travelling to Thailand and Vietnam in February. As others have pointed out it’s just a small amount of people who have been diagnosed with it outside of China. I’m keeping my eye on reports and also what the Foreign Office advice is on travelling to Thailand and Vietnam. Until the official advice is not to travel I’m still going. If I cancel otherwise my insurance won’t cover me.
"Stay on top of the news. Google ""coronavirus Vietnam"". Cases and suspect cases are in many cities now. A flight from China's Wuhan area was allowed into Vietnam on Jan. 22. I've lived in Ho Chi Minh for the past 4 years. I have zero faith in the government here to do anything effective to protect against the virus, and whatever they say, you can't trust. This is based on my personal observations of the lack of hygiene, safety controls and corruption here. Safety and screening at airports will be a joke - it already is and I don't expect it will change for the virus. In my neighborhood, already locals and expats alike are wearing face masks into the groceries, which are just reopening today after Tet. Just wait until all of the people who traveled abroad come back here and some bring the virus. My family thankfully didn't travel during Tet (was already planned that way) and we will be staying out of schools and public places as much as possible over the next 2 weeks, since the virus can be spread before symptoms appear (according to the news). Having lived here for 4 years, we are accustomed to lack of western safety standards and health care measures. But that is a serious threat in light of the current situation and we are taking all precautions. Travel at your own risk."
"What a timely post. We too are going to Vietnam in February. We are keeping an eye on the situation but it looks encouraging. The Vietnamese government is trying to keep the virus out of the country. Information indicates that the virus may spread faster than SARS but not as deadly. We are healthy adults. Unless there is a serious outbreak in Vietnam we are going. We will wash our hands often and keep our hands away from our face. We may use face masks in the airport but medical opinions is that they really don’t help cause there isn’t a seal on the face. Research does advise if you wear them, dispose of them afterwards using them. Remove the mask by the ear hold and keep them away from the face. It is a virus. Take the normal precautions you take with colds and flus."
We too are wondering mask or no mask. Medical advisers say that is really isn’t that helpful without a seal. We may wear them cause it won’t hurt. Research (which makes sense) says not to pull the mask down if you wear one. Drags germs over your face. Remove using ear hold and dispose. We are more likely to wipe down or airplane seats and trays with disinfectant wipes and keep are hands clean and away from our face.
"I’ve booked travel to Vietnam , Cambodia and Thailand in Feb and unless foreign commonwealth office tell me differently then I will be travelling. It’s been confirmed in lots more countries as well and we can’t stay indoors permanently Each to their own but my bags are packed and will be in that flight unless it’s cancelled. Happy travels"
Another point about wearing a mask. Ask any doctor who wears a mask in an operating theatre and they will tell they must be changed every hour because after wearing them for longer will cause more problems for your own facial skin as the air you exhale has so much bacteria in it and the warm moist environment that you've created is perfect conditions for the bacteria to multiply in the millions.
"Is anyone stopping in Hong Kong before arriving into Vietnam? How do you feel about that? Is it worth finding another airline and stop (Qatar, South Korea?) Leaving on the 5th. Can't get a refund on my deposit for my tour but they are willing to have me postpone my trip until later."
I also have plan to visit HCM in middle of Feb. Will be using China Eastern via Shanghai. I inquired about canceling my airline ticket and they said I will not get the full refund but minus refund fee. Everybody who canceled the plan tickets have same situation?
"I would love to get an opinion if Hue would be considered a busy place (early March), if we were looking to steer away from the crowds / tour groups found in Da Nang and Hoi An? Or is it basically the same groups that end up in all three cities?Thank you in advance."
Yes Don. $200 to cancel with Air Canada. I personally wouldn’t go into Shanghai but my boys tell me that I am making too much of this. Maybe it’s not as bad as the media makes it out to be.
"Or vietnam is not transparent enough! Find it hard to believe that only 2 people were found in Vietnam m, when one third of their international tourists are Chinese"
"I have a booked trip to Vietnam at the end of February. I am worried too, but for the moment I don't intend to cancel it.We are still having a whole month and if the virus spreads around, then the travel agency will definitely cancel the trip and won't take the risk."
We are in HCMC and are to fly to DaNang on January 31.There are currently 26 people quarantined in hospital in DaNang.A lot of people are wearing masks in HCMC we were given masks at our hotel reception yesterday. We also do not know if we should cancel our trip and fly home to Canada. We have a Vietnamese friend that lives in HCMC and we will have a discussion later today about virus. It's a difficult decision. Good luck

"Janice: what is the mood there? Are people panicked or life is as usual during flu season? Vietnamese people that I have asked here, told me it’s better to go later on if possible because it’s still new and evolving. Not sure how their medical system can take on an influx of tourists worried about the slightest cough and fever at this time. The same goes for Canada during flu season though. On the other hand, I have a friend in Phuket going to Vietnam and she is having a ball. I have to make a decision today or tomorrow."
I have booked a holiday for almost three weeks in Vietnam. Travelling from North to South I clouding a short stopover and tour in Singapore. Accordiing to this article it seems like it is spreading in Vietnam and the officials are keeping it quiet. I'll keep a look out out the news and official websites.Have a read :https:/…
And this linkAdvisory not to travel https:/…
"Maybe it is getting worse. I see the UK government is now warning against non essential travel to mainland China. https:/…china as of today. Although the virus is also mentioned on its Vietnam page, it doesn't as yet say don't go to Vietnam."
Stay home
hue is part of the three destination tour package. dang-hue-hoi an. i am vietnamese and i dont want to be near there now. go south...less chinese national tourist. right now im concerned about vietnamese coma back from china after holidays tour
"I've also booked for Vietnam in March.However, if it was me booked for Feb. I would definitely cancel.I'm still waiting but most likely to cancel."
Yes! My cancellation fee is 260$
Why would you want to gamble? There are plenty of other nice places to visit without the risk. You have your whole life ahead of you and can go to Vietnam in the future. Good Luck.
A government site is advising against all travel to Vietnam. The incubation period is 7-14 days you may have the virus and not even know it. The virus can spread from an infected person 2 meters away. A hotel has cancelled all reservations of Chinese nationals in DaNang. Not sure of the mood here but people do seem to ME to be nervous. Our friend from HCMC is very nervous. We are talking about canceling our trip and flying home ASAP. We'll have to eat a lot our of flight costs within Vietnam.We are asking our friend to translate news in Vietnamese. Good luck in a decision.
"@janice ""A government site is advising against all travel to Vietnam.""Can you please post the referenced site? Thank you."
Very little news about it in the local papers. Today it did say that the father and son who had the virus were recovering well in a Saigon hospital.
How in the world are travelers
"What I was trying to say is how in the world are people planning to arrive in Vietnam supposed to make informed decisions on whether to continue with their travel plans without solid, reputable information? (This is more of a rhetorical question, but still, it's troubling that there seems to be lots of opinions, but few facts available). We are planning to arrive in Hanoi on 3/10 and domestically in Da Nang on 3/19. Hoping that some more clarity from reputable sources becomes available in the next few weeks."
"HiWe are seniors travelling to Vietnam early March and yes our tour includes Ho Chi Ming, Nah Trang, Hanoi, Sapa how do you stay away from crowds especially in HCM ?Has the Corona Virus got worse in Vietnam?Thank you"
"Hi Dee, we are in the same situation, we are flying to Vietnam via Hong Kong on the 7th... Also considering canceling or changing airlines to avoid Hong Kong but now wondering if Vietnam is safe."
"Have a planned trip at the end of February.I will act on UK Foreign Office travel advice and from the WHO. They are the best and if they advise not to travel, insurances will refund paid costs.I won't cancel on amateur advice."
"Well, at the moment we have 2 cases in Vietnam, 0 deaths? Of course, it may get worse, nobody knows. Of course I would observe the situation.But there are far more risks if you travel, nobody seems to be concerned about (data Vietnam from WHO and others):Dengue (2019 untill end November): 242.000 / 43 deathsMalaria (2018): 5.800 / 9Traffic deaths (2018): 8200To compare, Flu in Germany (winter 2017/18): 333.000 / 1665 ... Maybe worse for me staying home.Edited: 3:56 am, January 29, 2020 "
"16,000 deaths from the flu in USA. This winter alone,... 250,000 gun deaths, we have 6 confirmed people in Australia with it and we are all going crazy...."
Chinese tour groups tend to visit the sites that you mentioned. They are usually in large groups and it is difficult to avoid them.
Wir fliegen Ende Februar über Singapor nach Hanoi und arbeiten uns dann Richtung Saigon durch. Prozentual sind in Deutschland bislang mehr Menschen an Influenca gestorben. Darüber spricht keiner. Die Vietnamesen tragen zu einem Großteil eh immer Mundschutz. Wir fliegen auf jeden Fall!
"""Chinese tour groups tend to visit the sites that you mentioned. ""You must have missed reports that the Chinese government has banned group tours."
Im going Vietnam feb 13 2020 should i cancel because disease
"Here is the situation. Border to Vietnam still remain open to Chinese Nationals. These are individuals may or may not been infected with virus seeking shelters from their own country. Right now I would not feel safe sitting in the same room with one chinese national, imagine sitting with 30 in a plane from Hanoi to Saigon. or on a bus. Everyone can make their own decision. My family Saigon and a doctor in Saigon told us. STAY WHERE YOU ARE DO NOT COME HERE. Maybe 2 weeks from now things will change. as of now I m not going back to Saigon"
https://youtu.be/pwDcEjRYp-UWHO live now ... mostly giving praise to China.
"If I understand properly, WHO is having an emergency meeting tomorrow about calling it an international emergency. I could have misunderstood."
"Cancel. Definitely,"
yes cancel. The virus is moving everywhere. At the moment no one can stop it. No one knows who realy has it. It could be in the plane or airport. This is also serious like the Ebola virus. No cure untill the patients died.
"WHO Director general mentioned a worry about human to human transmission like in Germany, Vietnam and Japan. But only 2 in Vietnam and hasn’t spread. 3 in Canada and all travelled to China. So really hard to make heads or tails of this. From what I read, it will peak in the next two weeks."
"My concern is that there will be a lot of people returning to Vietnam after the Chinese new year holidays, specifically Chinese nationals that works in Vietnam.Although Vietnam already refused to issue travel visa to china/hk/macau, these are people that already have the visa to return to Vietnam.Thoughts?"
Hi. We are flying to Vietnam for two weeks on Tuesday. The video info on Vietnamese TV is rather shocking... Saying many many cases but not being reported.What country government site is saying not to go? We lose everything almost 9000 euro....

"Hi. We are also traveling to da nang woth a connecting flight from seoul Korea. We’re all nervous but we wil boost up our immune system by taking emergen c 2 wks prior and the whole time there. I would pack sanitizer, sanitizer wipes and make sure you wear a mask. Just use common sense when it comes to hand washing and you should be fine."
"Anyone is traveling there with children under 5? My wife is worrying sick about this, but we're already pay $4k for the tickets and very hesitant to reschedule"
hiwe similar concerned - fly to HCM on Friday 31/01 and make way to Da Nang in stages to fly home from there on 14/02. Intend to travel but keep good standards to personnal hygiene (hands inparticular)..
Do not take risk. My friends were so worry are waiting for the flight to korea tonight to get out of Viet Nam ASAP. Vietnamese government announced today that they do not close their border between China Móng Cái etc... and continue to welcome chinese tourists. The Riverside Hotel in Danang had cancel all the contract tours from China. But Vietnamese government sent police to the hotel and force them to open for more clients from China otherwise the Hotel will be fined and sent to court.Do not go there! If you get sick and go to the hospital in Vietnam it will be very expensive there and could have a chance to contact to corona virus patients there.People in VN want to get the H... out of the country but they dont have a chance. Good Luck!!!...
"DO NOT GO IF YOU CAN.My friends are in Saigon Vietnam, they want to get out of VN ASAP.They are worry sick that the plane might cancel counting minute by minute to get on the plane to Korea TONIGHT."
We have plans to travel to Vietnam in February. The travel clinic at our hospital has advised us to postpone our trip--both to protect our health and to avoid the potential of quarantine if we happen to be in a place where the virus has been confirmed. Check with your physician!
"""I am travelling to Thailand and Vietnam in February. As others have pointed out it’s just a small amount of people who have been diagnosed with it outside of China."" Thailand has the second highest number of confirmed cases in the world behind mainland China."

we like you wondering due 3 weeks including phu quoc which is major Chinese resort...….no advice from holiday firms they just want to keep the money
"You got more chances of catching it n Australia with 2 of our confirmed cases now cleared and gone home, another man flew from Melbourne to Gold Coast and is positive to the virus and is now in isolation in the Gold Coast hospital along with 8 tour companions who are also in lock down including 4 of them with symptoms. So a possible further 8 at least...then the people that sat next to him on the plane, ..So impossible to contain, he's been through 2 airports a hotel a restaurant which is now closed, probably a taxi or train, who knows."
The WHO is reconvening a meeting with International Health Regulations Emergency Committee today to advise whether the virus constitutes a public emergency and will issue guidance if that is the case https://tinyurl.com/wqlqzkv
"I arrived in Hanoi yesterday from US, traveled through Incheon also. They seem to have very good protocols to n place at the airports. However, looking back on it, I probably should have worn a mask on the plane like 75% of the people. And keep sanitary/disinfectant wipes handy if it doesn't blow up between now and your departure I wouldn't worry much about it."

Hi I had to cancel my trip (from India to hanoi on 1st feb) as there were 4kids in our group...even though it's not yet clear if children's are high risk group for Corona virus infection..I didn't wanted take the risk because we had planned for 10days stay..but if we were to be only adults I wouldn't gave canceled for sure...
"I would not travel to Wuhan, Hubei province in China. So far every person diagnosed worldwide with coronavirus is either there, or travelled from there up until Wednesday this week. As of today there are two cases so far of a secondary viral infection with the novel coronavirus outside of China, one in Japan and one in Germany. That’s 2, worldwide.The Japanese case is a tour guide who was guiding tourists from Wuhan. The German case is of someone who did a training course with someone from Wuhan.Of the 7 confirmed cases in Australia all are travellers from Wuhan. All travelled to Australia with hundreds of passengers and crew on board aircraft without a single case of secondary infection.Of those 7, 4 have now been released as they are no longer symptomatic. The cases in Germany and Japan the people are apparently quite well.Personally, I would certainly not be travelling to Wuhan but coronavirus would not stop me travelling anywhere else, including the United States, Germany or Japan. So certainly not Vietnam.By way of comparison over 8,000 people have died so far this flu season in the United States from common influenza.But people are thinking of cancelling travel to Vietnam?"

Latest report from Ministry of Health:https://vietnamnews.vn/society/591638/first-…
Are you going?
My goodness that is such bad news. I decide to go then I decide to cancel.
I'm in exact same situation as you. Departure feb 3. Appears I can cancel my tickets with 300$ penalty on each. Wondering more about quality of trip with this a constant consideration. Away for a month. What will have developed in that time....so hard to know what to do.
Yes...will going to eat be constant worry.. Crowded areas etc... British Airways are not being great. Altho we are in business they will only give taxes back so 200 euro of 3900 euro... And the group Luxury Travel says we lose it all
"Judging by the way this is going you might find flights start to get cancelled by governments. I wouldn't be cancelling off my own back.If the airlines cancel you lose nothing. Seems the Prime minister of Vietnam is upping the crisis level. While people compare it to flu, its the number that perish without medical intervention that is the concern. Unfortunately seems its the medical staff that end up in the front line for going down with it."
I called BA.. They said only if they cancel their flights will this apply. Example altho China said to block borders BA only stopped flights 2 days ago. Vietnam just announced that they are finally not allowing Chinese visas
"I am cancelling my trip in February, and will be out about 400 USD. At first I tried not to panic and be logical about the situation, but something is not right with the information coming out about this.Why would the Chinese Government lock down this millions, and build a hospital that can house thousands?They are also heavily censoring any information and footage coming out of the areas affected. Usually in a crisis this big we would see footage and updates. The only footage I have seen that claims to be from the scene is saying this is much worse, and much bigger than we are being told. I would rather stay safe, and go later when the experience will be better."
"Breaking news, story still developing. The WHO has declared the coronavirus a global emergency https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51318246"
thanks everybody for your repliesi'm due to fly to VN in a few days and I m rather worriedyou' ve helped me in someway
"I have paid a deposit on a trip to Vietnam in April. I am very concerned about the coronavirus and unless the situation improves dramatically over the next 4 weeks, I will cancel."
"Hey guys,Like Ray we also have plans to visit Vietnam in April (Hanoi, Hoi An and Sa Pa) but we are very concerned with this developing news.April is very far off, but any predictions about if we should cancel or persevere?Thanks so muchClay"
"Are you kidding me! We have travelled all over the world. We are in HCMC at the moment and have cancelled all travel North of HCMC. We are trying to leave Vietnam before WHO declares a Global emergency which is a possibility. Lots of hotels are turning all Chinese away,"
"we are there in March, not even given consideration to cancelling"
"Listen to the WHO ! Unfortunately I had to cancel my trip to Vietnam last Sunday due to my hubby’s stomach problems along the same time as this hit media headlines. However if you do go, bear in mind there is a possibility borders/airports may close & you could risk being stuck in Vietnam (Hanoi is only 324km from the China border)! Will you be restricted to where you can go in Vietnam ? Wearing a mask all the time & worrying about visiting markets - is that fun ? It’s so Tricky as the country needs tourism & then you think -,is all of this media Hype ?? but I do feel it is risky at the moment as the WHO have issued an emergency, Make sure you have a cancellation policy on hotels if need be & also don’t do a ‘no show’ on flights - you could get your airport taxes back x keep safe & have fun xx health is everything xx ps. Don’t book internal flights yet as there is a non-refund policy - I’ve learnt that the hard way !"
"Also going in March and not cancelling. We'll be wearing face masks on the flights there and back, using medicated wipes on seats and trays, and practicing normal hygiene rules like washing hands thoroughly and regularly. Not just to avoid a coronavirus infection, but all the other lurgies that saturate the air inside an aircraft on a long-haul flight."
You should go Jen dont stay in sauga forever
"That's what has me confused,they are neighbors and Vietnam is China's close getaway. Am I missing something? I have a ticket to leave Canada for Vietnam on Feb 3rd."
"Yesterday there are people mocking me for being a one post wonder. I have family in Saigon, i cancel my flight on Feb 6 to Saigon. My family have a doctor and he TOLD me to stay where I am. As of right now the government is worry about chaos . Vietnam medical teams DO Not have the capacity to handle an outbreak. I pray an outbreak would not reach Saigon, However given the numbers of Chinese Nationals travel through out vietnam in the past month unchecked or accounted for, it is a miracle Vietnam only have a handful of cases. Vietnam doctors in Saigon don't have enough testing equipment. Please avoid unnecessary risk. One Post wonder or not I m trying to advocate safety first. Note I am alway skeptical of the Vietnamese Gov. I used to live with them"
"""One Post wonder or not I m trying to advocate safety first.""As a medical professional?Or as an unqualified three post forum contributor? ;-)Scott"
"I agree, I use to get sick pretty much every time after I fly long haul , I now take throat lozenges and throat spray with me and use during flight and no longer get sick , could be just luck or it actually kills bugs"
"3 post wonder, and as a father of 3 girls who over worry about alot of things :)"
"I’m booked for travel 10th March , concerning, will see how things develop. More confirmed cases in Australia then vietnam at this point which is on my doorstep. All travel concerns me as I normally get home after long haul flights and get sick I think due to aircon. I now take throat and nasel spray and since last 2 trips haven’t been sick on return."
"The latest announcement from the WHO https://www.who.int/. However it states ""The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available."". I think the biggest worry is that it reaches a country which might not be in the best position or unable to put in place the correct measures to stop the spread of the virus."
8500 vehicle deaths...last time I heard motor vehicle accidents are not contagious. Love your optimism but you are comparing Apples with Antelopes.My advise is to use common sense and keep yourself well informed with facts.... so don't watch CNN or MSNBC.
"Hi there, I’m in Australia....just wondering which throat and nasal spray you use. My daughter always gets sick when she travels. This might help her also. TIA"
"We're a group of 16/17 year olds travelling to Vietnam next Thursday for 2 weeks, and we're trekking for 4 days. Is it safe for us? The school doesn't seem to be cancelling the trip because apparently the ""media's exaggerating the situation"" but I'm not convinced it is safe."
The main site for info is the World Health Organisation. This is their advice to the public https://tinyurl.com/vr9owsn
"I have a trip planned early March and am thinking the same things - less about the virus and more about sudden quarantines, airport security checks, a general sense of nervousness - I want to eat a LOT of food and go to markets...and tbh - think the number is higher than reported (and I'm not an alarmist)...but my sense is I won't enjoy the vacation..."
"I think at this point it is best that everyone cancel their trips, particularly if they are going the first two weeks in March. I would love to have avoid crowds while I am there."
"The problem is that if you get the sniffles for any reason DURING the trip, you have to report the symptoms, and then would probably be quarantined somewhere in Vietnam."
make sure your masks are the ones that they use in hospitals and fit properly otherwise they are useless and may even make it easier for the virus to infect as once the mask is moist from your breath it can harbour the virus
"You would have to wear an N95 mask to protect you and no one is going to want to try to breath through that. Masks are not to prevent you from getting sick, they are for the sick to limit their spread of germs. If you are healthy and walking around with a mask to try to avoid getting sick you are just wasting your time. Your current risk of catching coronavirus in Vietnam or even anywhere other than Wuhan is infinitely small. You are still more likely to get Hep A or Typhoid and WAY more likely to get and die of influenza. If you are cancelling your trip now you are overreacting. Not saying the situation can’t change a month from now in Vietnam but right now there is nothing to worry about. And I am a doctor for what it is worth."
"I would not trust Vietnam statistic, still a communist regime, hide information , very opaque policy"
"Dont go to Hoian I was just there. Its packed with Chinese because of the new year. The hotels,airports etc. Stood in immigration line entering and leaving for almost 45 minutes with people all around. I left a day earlier."
"* You are still more likely to get Hep A or Typhoid and WAY more likely to get and die of influenza*There are vaccinations against all of those diseases! Surely as a doctor you know that?I don't understand why people are getting so much grief over wanting to cancel their trips, surely that's a personal choice, it's not affecting anyone else's trip is it?"
"After all these comments, what have you decided to do Jenn? I’m due to depart for Vietnam in 3 days, and still haven’t decided whether to go or not."
"She cancelled but you should not. I am from Delhi most of the population here haven't even heard about corona virus still people are bullsh**ing about it on trip advisor Indian forums.Edited: 4:19 am, February 01, 2020 "
"Five confirmed cases out of which 1 is cured that leaves with total 4 active cases in vietnam. More than 100 quarantined in Vietnam out of which around half of them have been discharged as test were negative, some tests are pending and some people are quarantined with normal health just becauase they were in touch with people showing symptoms.I am purely answering based on news monitoring and moat of the others are also doing the same which should not be the case I think it's better if only those people comment who arr already present there"
And it continues....Sigh....Scott
"Hiwe are a group of 5 - all 50 year old ; healthy women , we cancelled our trip to Vietnam that was planned 4 of Feb. the reasons:1. the biggest number of tourists in Vietnam are from china2. the most problematic thing with this virus - ITS CONTAGIOUS WITHOUT SYMPTOMS.3. nobody knows how long it lives on serfuces etcwe were planed to go with minivan with a driver and guide- maybe they were with chines tourist- and are now in the incubation period , or some tourist were in the van (again not even sick , just incubating) and the surfaces in the van has the virus....BETTER BE SAFE THEN SORRY-also- when we come back- every fever - will put me in stress for 2 more long weeks , and thinking of my family ... we have cancelled."
"Unfortunately the 6th case is out:https:/…1223491976428838912Viet Nam confirmed 6th novel #coronavirus infection case this morning. The latest case, aged 25, is a hotel receptionist in central coastal of Khanh Hoa province===Planning to leave on 8th Feb from India... Waiting for more 48 hours and then will decide."
"On dear. We are due in Vietnam on Wednesday from the UK. We are VERY worried. It's not the worry we might catch the virus, it's the fear of not knowing how quickly things could escalate and the inevitable lockdown that would follow. I'd sped the whole trip in a panic, so what's the point. But the cost of cancelling is eye watering!"
Don't worry we have at least 10 in Australia you are safer in Vietnam then here.
"Hello Northern Lass. We are also flying on Wednesday from Heathrow to Vietnam. Unless the Foreign office says that it's unsafe to travel I'm going. There is risks always when you travel (you could get hit by a coconut in the caribbean:) Strange thing is that they recommend you wear a mask in 'vehicles' and in crowded places... Everywhere is sold out in the UK. The media and press reports are really not helping. Anyway, have a fabulous time... I will :) x"
"From an expat forum - Federal Aviation Administration notice posted saying all flights between Vietnam and Macau, Hong Kong and Taipei have been cancelled until May 1.Regardsrayza"
The irony is that we cancelled our trip to Vietnam & decided to go to Tenerife instead & booked to do a day trip to La Gomera tomorrow . Apparently there is now a confirmed case in the small island of La Gomera - have cancelled !
"""Apparently there is now a confirmed case in the small island of La Gomera - have cancelled !""So what's the plan, hide in your bedroom?Scott"
"No man is an island entire of itself; every manis a piece of the continent, a part of the main;if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europeis the less, as well as if a promontory were, aswell as any manner of thy friends or of thineown were; any man's death diminishes me,because I am involved in mankind.And therefore never send to know for whomthe bell tolls; it tolls for thee."
"Lulu. I have more masks that Amazon. If I see you in Heathrow I will give you some! But at this moment I am so unhappy about this, I fear we will cancel and take the hit. The latest case today is a 25 year old receptionist in a hotel, who has not been to China."
"""No man is an island entire of itself; every manis a piece of the continent....""Uhhh?Be funny if it wasn't so sad.Scott"
"I feel sad you are so anxious about your travels. La Gomera is such a small island so it shows no matter where you are going there are risks. The UK has 2 confirmed cases. Not in Dorset... yet. I think no matter where you are in the world right now there are risks. “It is important to expect nothing, to take every experience, including the negative ones, as merely steps on the path, and to proceed.”― Ram Dass :)"

"We received notification to foreign business owners in Vietnam telling us that it is expected that Vietnam will be isolated very soon... With that we have reduced our travel to one week and are only staying in Saigon (internal flights are not advised if you don't have masks, etc. This is on the Minister site of Vietnam and on the Vietnam airlines site)"
"‘On Saturday, Vietnam said it would stop all flights to and from China. The Vietnamese government said it would also stop issuing visas for foreign visitors who had been in China in the past two weeks. All permits granted for flights between Vietnam and China, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau have been revoked until further notice, the government said in a statement.’ CBC Canada"
"Can you post links to this info colette0411 that ""it is expected that Vietnam will be isolated very soon"" such strong words...Can you post the e-mail you got sent? would be helpful"
"We are currently in Vietnam and are planning on staying for another two weeks, we work in China and are not planning to go back until we have to. (We left Shanghai over 2 weeks ago, so we think we are through the incubation period) We have already been here for 2 weeks to Ho Chi Min, Phu Quoc, Hoi An and Da Nang tomorrow. At the start of the trip, there were not many masks around, now there are more. We feel safe, but we are two fit healthy people in our 30's. We have worn masks in airports and on planes, after reading about masks, I'm not sure what protection they offer TBH.We are using a lot of hand sanitizer after handling money/before eating/ riding bikes etc, apparently that should help.Vietnam is a beautiful country, I've visited 4 times. I think it's a personal choice, if you want to travel, do it. But you don't want to spoil your holiday, if you are going to be worried every time some one coughs.Edited: 9:59 am, February 01, 2020 "
Face masks are not effective in preventing contracting the virus.
"collete0411...where does it say Vietnam will be ""isolated soon"". As a side note, in the UK have British Airways & Virgin stopped flights to China last week"
"""WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their healthcare provider.""I'm going to Hanoi on the 18th February.No plans to cancel unless the plane doesn't take off.No plans to wear a mask (pointless after 30mins anyway), just use anti bacterial wipes on everything I need to touch (though to be honest I should do that everywhere anyway)At least with all these people cancelling it should be fairly tourist crowd free."
Dave P - Just bought some Dettol Surface spray and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that it kills Corona Virus!! New label or been around a while. Dont forget to antibac the plane table and remote. I am hoping for extra seats on the plane :-)
Well up until now I was going ahead with my trip to VN but not looking good as I was flying from London via HNK and they have just canceled flights from HNK until further notice
Is it a specifically c airline that has cancelled or all of them. Have they said why?
*Dave P - Just bought some Dettol Surface spray and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that it kills Corona Virus!!*I think you'll find the term Coronavirus covers a range of viruses including the common cold. Scientists say there is no evidence Dettol spray is effective against the 2019-nCoV strain.
"You'll have to transfer some of the Dettol to a less than 100ml bottle otherwise they won't let you take it onto the plane.I have a bag of 200 Clinell wet wipes that are antibacterial- also claim to kill coronavirus, just transfer a dozen to a ziplock bag for the flight."
"Yes all flights from HK until further notice, Im not flying until the 19th so I hope the restriction may be lifted"
"Are you sure ALL flights to Vietnam from Hong Kong are canceled? I know VN airlines has canceled all it’s flights to Hanoi from HK. And I believe they are limiting service from Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City. I am actually due to fly on Cathay Pacific 2/20 to Vietnam with a layover in HK. And I just spent an hour waiting to speak to somebody in customer service. They stated, So far, our flight on February 21 has NOT been cancelled but all flights from HK to VN were cancelled for 2/1 only but due to resume 2/2? This conversation happened at approx 12:30pm EST.Finally, I’m less worried about catching mortal illness and more concerned about being stranded or quarantined if something worsens in a country with less than 1st world medical care. For what it’s worth, a good friend who is an executive for Delta has a strong feeling that HK will eventually be wrapped up in the mainland China travel ban. So if you are flying Cathay, that’s a no bueno"

"I hope you right as going through HK to Hanoi on the 19th Feb, same as you, not worried about the virus in VN"

"siubhail,I do realize there are vaccines against all of them but I also realize how few people get the vaccines. A majority of the people in the US do not get the flu vaccine and many people who travel to Vietnam do not get Hep A or Typhoid vaccines despite their effectiveness and availability. People just aren't afraid of them because they aren't in the news constantly."
"I saw your post because I am also going the same time as you are, but coming from the US. I am going to Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Sapa and Ninh Binh. My Vietnamese friend, who has family and friends there, recently told me that the country is full of Chinese tourists and they apparently haven’t closed the border yet to China. He strongly advised me not to go, so I don’t know what to do as well! I’ve already booked my flight and it’s not cheap. Uhhh!"
"No risk in Vietnam ; A few CHINESE tourists arrived sick from Wuhan and are hospitalized ; no deaths. Moreover, the Viet government has forbidden all flights between Vietnam and China since yesterday. Once again, the infernal media and their panicky announcements are winning !!!!"
"We are due to fly on Wednesday and STILL haven't decided if we should cancel. Our tour company say our trip is still viable, but we are very worried."
Our tour guide said things are calm especially on N but we decided to avoid internal flights (3)and have lost the money but told our private tour organizers that we were only going to stay for 5 nights and stay in HoChi Minh where pur international flight arrives.

I m still urging everyone to stay for a short while, until more information come in. As for my flight to Vietnam it was cancel without penalty so no money loss. I m still trying to think for my family and Why would I risk my own health by coming to a potential epidemic region? Why would I risk the health of my love one if I comeback and Infect them?....too much risk involved for a trip. Vietnam will be there 3 months from now.

"But Vietnam is not cancelling flights from Hong Kong and Macau, which I believe may be the next places with possible wide spread infections of the coronavirus as millions of people from mainland China have already traveled to Hong Kong. Hong Kong also have not closed off its border to mainland China and is still allowing many more mainland Chinese people in every day. This virus may already be transmitted to so many people in Hong Kong, who have not yet show any symptoms and may not even know if they are infected as the incubation period is up to 14 days. I have a trip planned to Vietnam at the end of March. If the Vietnam government does not ban flights from Hong Kong and Macau soon and close its borders to China, I definitely will not be coming to Vietnam, especially when a reception worker at one of the resort in Khanh Hoa got infected from a Chinese tourist. What is the point of going on vacation to Vietnam when you constantly have to worry about getting transmitted with the virus, stressing over it, having to avoid tourist attractions. No thanks!Edited: 12:19 pm, February 02, 2020 "

Millions of mainland Chinese people have traveled to Hong Kong since the initial outbreak at the epicenter in Wuhan and is continuing to do so everyday as Hong Kong has not closed its border to mainland China and those people may already be infected and have infected others in Hong Kong. Many cities in mainland China have people infected, not just Wuhan. A woman from Shanghai went on a business meeting in Japan and infected 7 colleagues during the 4 days there. She didn't even travel to Wuhan herself. The danger of this coronavirus is that someone can be infected, transmit the virus to someone else before they they even show any symptoms. For me, the short vacation is not worth getting infected and sharing the illness with my family, friends and spreading to others who have weaker immune systems and may not be able to fight off the infections. I would recommend against it right now unless things change. But the outbreak seems to become more serious each and everyday. I have a planned trip to Vietnam at the end of March and is seriously considering cancelling it."
"Ant eater, there are rougly 2 month till end of march."
Are you in Vietnam right now? How is the situation there now? I heard today (2/2/20) that all the schools in Ho Chi Minh City are closed for 1 week. Please advise as I am supposed to leave on 2/10/20.
"My son says it seems ridiculous to him, everything normal there. (Hanoi) He is now working a week in school with no students and his partner is at home, unpaid. it does seem a knee jerk reaction, surely locking those flights in and out is the first step.Edited: 1:33 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"After a long time of debating, I finally cancelled my flight. I lost almost $400 usd but I won’t risk my health and safety. My friend who has family and friends in Vietnam advised me not to go. They haven’t banned the flights coming from HK and Macau. I was going to Hanoi, Sapa, Halong bag, and they’re all in the north side of the country - very close to China! Plus, I don’t think I will enjoy my vacation if I’m constantly thinking about getting the virus. I will go back some other time though."
"Interesting the rate of reported infection has now slowed, or is this misinformation !! https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"

"I'm flying out on Friday and understand the risk. There are less infected people in Vietnam compared to Australia, and with flight bans, visa bans on anyone that has been in China for the last 14 days, it's a fairly low risk.That being said - some tour companies have started cancelling tours, so it might be a very quiet time in Vietnam"
"We are due to go in early March. If i cancel within the next 48 hours I get 50% of my tour money back. After reading 242 of the above replies I agree that the risk of getting the virus might be low. However the prospect of what may be our only trip to Vietnam having a cloud of anxiety over it the entire time with everyone wearing masks like a sci-fi movie, washing our hands like we have OCD, being afraid of crowded places and the uncertainty of what the future holds makes me want to postpone the trip so when we do go we can hopefully enjoy ourselves more in a less stressful environment."
"Our group were supposed to go to VN for three weeks for charity work,leaving on February 17. We cancelled our flights two days ago. There are more untold positive cases in VN than the 2 that were announced, not to mention the numbers mutiply as of today. You may have to rethink instead of taking a chance."
"Vietnam issued Decision No.173.QD-TTg declaring the novel coronavirus infection as an epidemic – in line with the World Health Organization’s declaration of the virus as a global health emergency.Vietnam has confirmed the eighth person infected with the virus. The government has ordered the health ministry to supervise and early detect infected cases, monitor border crossings, airports, and seaports, particularly for passengers coming from affected areas.Vietnam’s civil aviation authority suspended all flights to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan on February 1. However, the authority lifted the ban for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan from February 2. Flights to mainland China remain suspended.https:/…Edited: 2:45 am, February 03, 2020 "
Bee 1987. Which tour companies are cancelling tours?
So did you go to Vietnam at the end? I have flight tickets to Hanoi for the 13 of February and still hesitating...
"Question for anyone with clinical background: I am a senior with a pulmonary fibrosis condition and traveling to Vietnam and Laos in March - multiple airports (Hue, Luang Prabang and Hanoi). Only going to Hue, Hanoi and Quang Tri areas, plus Luang Prabang. I have some preventative and response travel meds for flu-like conditions, should they arise, but feeling a bit uncertain about going to this area at this time - not getting into a panic mode, but wondering about increasing my vulnerability to get sick - plus the hassles that can arise in airport queues. Have had vaccines of course, but as a senior with a lung condition, maybe this is not a good time to go to SE Asia - or maybe it doesn't matter. Looking for a fresh perspective, if someone has some insight or recommendations for me. Thank you,"
"> recommendations for meUm, talk to your doctor. Anybody who gives you advice with a two line medical history is probably not to be listened to.Nobody knows what the risk is, but don't listen to anyone who says there is ""No risk""."
"Im also going to Vietnam in February. Im still going despite the CoronaVirus. You should go if it make you feel happy. If you also kinda wanna be protected, wear a mask."
"Hi, I have been stalking this post for a week, contemplating on whether to go. My flight leaves tomorrow night from San Francisco and I have decided to go. If I cancel I will be out by about $1500. Risk doesn’t seem extremely high as a healthy individual, it’s my first time seeing my motherland, and to be frank I have plans after February (to study more and to travel elsewhere). Send a prayer!"
We have also decided not to change are plans and we are going next week
"I have travel plans to head to Vietnam in April and at this point am still going.With reports of about a 2% mortality rate, this is currently about as dangerous as the flu.As long as you're healthy, stay vigilant with hygiene, and things don't worsen I would still go!"
"We are also scheduled to go end of the month. We are seniors in our 70s and in excellent health. However, got our vaccinations Hep A & B, Tetanus (I was due), Typhoid, flu shot. Have no plans to cancel. Its your state of mind...be careful about your surroundings, watch what/where you eat. Enjoy visiting what I understand is a beautiful country!"
"I had a cancellation from Saigon hotpot tours.'We are unreservedly sorry for the cancellation of your tour. As you may know, Vietnamese government has recently declared the Coronavirus outbreak a confirmed domestic infection due to the complicated progress and the high infectious risk caused by the virus itself. In addition, there has been a number of universities announcing a long break for students with the avoidance of the epidemic exposure. As a result, to make sure the health protection for both you and the tour guide, we have come to the conclusion that we have to cancel your tour.We hope that you can understand the situation and take reasonable precautions against the infection in order to have a safe trip.One more time, we would like to sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and we hope that it will not bother you and your feeling about Saigon.Saigon Hotpot hopes to be your local companion in the near future.'"
"Thank you Bea. We have decided to fly on Wednesday this week as planned, for better or for worse."
"""With reports of about a 2% mortality rate, this is currently about as dangerous as the flu."" Mortality rate of influenza is about 0.13% and the mortality rate for the corona virus is around 2.1%. So the corona virus is much more dangerous if you get infected with it. Its just nowhere near as widespread as the flu at this point."
@norma & @scott ...i still havent cancelled my flight yet but i still think i wont be taking the risk!! Haha
@jennI should be flying out today. But I’ve cancelled. Perhaps next year.
@norma aw !! That’s unfortunate to hear :( but definitely will be worth it when you can go and be care freee
"We are planning to fly to Ho Chi Min for 2 days on Feb 15 than to Phu Quoc for 2 weeks. What is the current situation on Ho Chi Min. What is the mood there at the moment? Considering cancelling. Can someone provide feedback if they are currently there.Edited: 8:13 pm, February 03, 2020 "
"I've been following this thread, meant to go in just over a week but I'm leaning towards cancelling. The main reason being that I'm self employed and if I can't work due to illness or I'm quarantined it will make this an expensive trip! You can practice good hygiene but it's only as good as the person who is preparing your food. If I don't go now Vietnam will still be there in a few months when they have a vaccine and it would be nice to visit when people aren't having to wear masks.Still keeping an eye on reported cases but I wish people wouldn't compare the number of cases in Vietnam to Australia, for example, and say it's safer there. The healthcare system in Vietnam is not the same as your home country if you're visiting from Europe, USA etc"
"Yes, Nothing for sure but Vietnamese goverment and doctors are running a very good solution to control it. Do not worry, Ha Noi, Ha Long Bay, Ninh Binh... are still safe to go"
We leave today for Vietnam. I will post as to how things are.
How about Dalat? Have bought tickets to go there in 2 weeks time.
I have flights scheduled for Feb 21-29 into Hanoi. I would love to know what you think to make a decision to cancel or not. Thank you!!!
I m in HCM right now. Arrived today and all lufe goes normal here no panic. Even locals are not wearing masks. Yes there are few cases in Hanoi and you may avoid that.
"9 cases in Vietnam including 4 Vietnamese. Out of the 9, 8 were on the same flight originated from Wuhan, and this out of 97 million people + hundred of thousands of Occidental tourists. One of the Vietnamese is from a province west of Hanoi ans is taken care of in a Hanoi hospital ; no case in Hanoi itself. Besides, all flights between China and Vietnam are banned since 1 February.

"I will be traveling to Vietnam in mid March to Saigon..work on my boom and lil bit travel. My Vietnamese friends say its okay but bring mask. Should i go for it ? I'm stay in Indonesia atm and no Corona victim until now. I will see how it goes until end if March and decide by that time,but my feeling say it will be ok. Thoughts on this ?"
Just keep an eye on the WHO Situation Reports.https:/…
Good advice Dave P. Travelling to a place that the WHO advise is unsafe/unsuitable for travel will void travel insurance I was reliably informed yesterday.
> I was reliably informed yesterday.Do you have a link for that?
Vietnam has not been declared unsuitable for travel... Maybe it will be in future. The Who updates are very informative but they don't say not to fly there.
"I just returned from Vietnam. If you not in a bad health and not of very young age or old age it should be not a problem at all to travel around in Vietnam. Just don't go to busy areas. Stay away from the biggest cities, as it is impossible to be around millions of people. City like Danang or smaller cities should be fine. Just keep your distance from other people and especially other tourists or Vietnamese a lot in contact with tourists. Rent a scooter, visit the country side. There will be not virus over there."
"Mr Olive - No crowds sounds good! I saved you travel blog to keep an eye what is going on there. Because we go to Vietnam also and very soon! Safe travels, Mr Olive"
"*Travelling to a place that the WHO advise is unsafe/unsuitable for travel will void travel insurance I was reliably informed yesterday.*Not true. You can purchase 'high risk' travel insurance for travelling to war zones if you so wish, or places the FCO has advised against travelling to."
Manatdollar My travel insurer explained to me via a phone call. So I am watching the W H O advice closely.
"> My travel insurer explained to me via a phone call. So I am watching the W H O advice closely.It's generally travelling against /government/ advice that voids your travel insurance, although some insurers cover even that."
"We have just had our first child diagnosed in Australia with the virus currently in Gold Coast hospital. They aren't sure if he contracted this with the rest of his tour group or if he's got it in Australia..this could change everything if he's contracted it here. ,"
https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/pm-orders-…Our flight is routed through Taipei. Does anyone have information if this applies? Or know where we can get information about this?
Why would you risk your heath or death over trip... Vn have 9 case now.. the number still rise ...there no way you still thinking or not decided ..
Contact your airline. They will have the most updated information.
"Statistically, it's a small risk, but still a risk to take.Similar to winning a lottery or a raffle, you never know you could be the next winner. Except people stuck in Wuhan, tourists from other countries never believe they could be the next patient. 'It a small risk, an d I take every precaution means.' Well, and when they got hit, 'Oh God, why me?'It's kind of Murphy's law.I myself would cancel my trip. Losing some money should be considered an accident, but it certainly would not cost my children a parent."
"Statistically, it is presently TEN cases today in Vietnam, including 8 in the same flight Wuhan-Saigon + one Viet woman who visited an infected Chinese. This out of 97 million people + tens of thousands of foreign tourists. I am not even going to calculate the percentage !For your info, I am in Hoi An ; all the Chinese are gone, very quiet !"
It is worth checking with the insurer.
"""My travel insurer explained to me via a phone call. So I am watching the W H O advice closely"" I wouldn't count on the WHO to warn you off. WHO's position seems to be that they don't like travel bans because they believe it may encourage countries in the future to withhold information about outbreaks in the future. I don't believe the WHO is putting individual traveler's welfare at the top of their list of considerations (or at least its not the sole thing they are considering) and instead are looking at a much broader range of concerns. Its best to rely on advice from health experts in individual countries, which are focused more specifically on the health concerns of individual travelers."
"I note, if true, in the newspapers that Vietnam are preparing with field hospitals. One must assume that the authorities are expecting an escalation in the situation. Wishing all travellers and those living in the area well."
For travel insurance to pay out there needs to be a travel ban in place 48hrs before travel.
We are booked to fly to Hanoi on 21st February but I have just read on the Vietnam Plus website that all tourist venues are to close in Hanoi as part of the campaign to prevent the virus from spreading.See https:/…168147.vnp
Do you know what places are going to be closed? And for how long?
"Here is the article in full:""Hanoi (VNA) – Historical and cultural relic sites as wells as tourist destinations in Hanoi will be closed to visitors and cultural activities at those sites suspended as part of the capital city’s preventive measures against the threat of the novel coronavirus (nCoV).In an urgent notice sent to People’s Committees of districts and agencies on February 4, the municipal Department of Sports and Culture urged stepping up the communication work to raise public awareness of the acute respiratory disease caused by nCoV and countermeasures.As from February 3, the People’s Committee of Hoan Kiem district has halted activities at the pedestrian streets in the district, which attract tens of thousands of people during each weekend.The moves are aimed at limiting the gathering of large numbers of people, in order to curb the spread of the dangerous virus.As of February 4 afternoon, Vietnam had recorded ten nCoV cases, with the latest patient being a 42-year-old woman in the northern province of Vinh Phuc, who had had close contact with an nCoV female patient in the province.According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Health, the deadly virus has now spread to 27 countries and territories worldwide, with 19,843 confirmed cases as of 6:00 on February 4./."""

"We were supposed to leave within 10 hours to Vietnam but decided to cancel our trip. Really bummed out because we were so excited to see the countries. We had to pay some of the last minute cancellation fees but it's not worth risking. Every day it's getting worse. My mom lives in Japan and I get more information from her than news in the US. We are not too worry about catching it (well, some what) but more so worry about getting stuck in Vietnam and not able to come back to US. I just got my nails done today and one of ladies that works at the salon who is a Vietnamese told me that she never thought that her hometown which is very southern part of Vietnam would have this virus but 2 taxi drivers who go to HCMC to make income got infected and brought back to her hometown. Now schools are closed for at least 2 weeks, she said. When I heard that, it helped me to decide to call off. We will somehow make time again and try to go to Vietnam and Cambodia to experience its beauty one day. It is very unfortunate but again, it's not worth risking at this point.Edited: 10:53 pm, February 05, 2020 "
All cities right now have the option to close any sites. We are cancelling our trip primarily because of the uncertainty and risk of not being able to get out!

"We leave for Vietnam this Sunday for 4 weeks, and were seriously starting to think we'd cancel the trip as tourist sites were being closed (and what's the point going with infection risk - however small, if we then can't see half the things we're going there for). Seems the closed sites have now been reopened following sterilisation. Also noticed all state schools are closed until further notice, to help prevent spread should there be any contagion in the wider population. Looks like the country are trying to do the right things to avoid it spreading - and by taking sensible personal care and having no underlying medical issues we should hopefully be OK."

"Enjoy your holiday Colette. I hear you on Saigon airport, it was pretty chaotic when we landed there!"
I agree check the WHO and Canadian Government Travel Advisory. I am Canadian here right now and many sites are closing their doors due to virus. Having said that tourism is down and it is a good time to visit as far as crowds go.
You too!
"I need to correct my previous comment about not worrying about it. The y evacuated Lan Ha Bay and Cat Ba today due to precautions for the virus. Some attractions may be closed also.

Where is this concern for not being able to get back to the US coming from? Is it because your flight had a layover in China? Not sure why this is a concern unless you think the US will place travel restrictions for Vietnam.
ready_spagettiProbably because if you do get sick or have a fever they are going to quarantine you for at least 14 days. As a precaution like the cruise ship now stuck in Japan they can't get home.
Can you buy travel insurance after flights have been purchased? Will it cover if we choose to cancel at a later date becuase of further spread or closure?
"Right, that makes sense especially if you're on a cruise ship! I saw an earlier post that mentioned not worrying too much about getting sick but worried about not being able to get back to the US after visiting HCMC. The post didn't make much sense unless there are concerns regarding the US placing travel restrictions (besides China)."
"We’re due to fly out to Hanoi in just over 4 weeks for a two week organised tour. Not worrying about the virus given the current numbers in relation to the population. Wondering though if many tourist places are being affected ie closures ? We’re going to Hanoi, then down the coast to a few places and ending up in HCMC."
For who is flying through Manila. Right now all tickets to Vietnam cost dirt cheap. Guess why.
"@digidaydreams I also have a flight booked to Hanoi via Manila on 3/1. I am not worried about Manila, but I am worried about Hanoi. 11 cases so far plus it is so close to the Chinese border. We have plans to go to Ha Long Bay, SaPa, and Ninh Binh which means we have to take some form of transportation from point A to B. Anxiety has taken over my life right now. I have been looking forward for this trip for months now. I don’t know if I should cancel and just explore some islands in the Philippines. My Vietnamese friend here in the US advised me not to go to Vietnam. IDK what to do."
"If anxiety has taken over your life, I do wonder why you haven't cancelled your trip already to be honest ?"
"We are travelling to Vietnam early September. Going to Hanoi, Hoi An, Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh city. Travelling from New Zealand. Hopefully this virus has a cure by then, or infections have decreased. We will be bringing hand sanitisers with us, along with masks. Be prepared when travelling in any country."

Your are not alone in your concern - I am due to fly on Sunday evening 9th Feb. Currently a little concerned.
"""If anxiety has taken over your life, I do wonder why you haven't cancelled your trip already to be honest ?""Low blow Jay. I'd be a little anxious too if I'd spend a lot of time and money on an upcoming trip in the current health climate. No-one knows when the end to this will be or whether it will get worse."

"Angelica. I’m not worried about Manila. Only the possibility of it being closed off and not being able to transit. Just go , unless the government stop you, my son lives in Hanoi and says life goes on as normal and no one is very worried. Of course it’s an evolving story. Of course if you are going to be anxious and can afford to cancel, perhaps you should. For me ... I can’t go another year without seeing my boy and Easter is the only time we can go so ...."
Aren't elderly people human anymore!!!
"the actions being taken by China, virtually shutting down the country and quarantining cities does not equate to the official victim/.death stats coming out of China, not by a long way. Read today that the source of the infection on that cruise ship was passengers that were on the ship 7 days before current cruise. If that is true, it means the virus can stay active on surfaces at least 7 days after contact and doesnt require person to person to be spread. That is bad, that is very bad"
"suibhail, if people are scared & worried, they need to stay at home, its as simple as thatI've been travelling around SE Asia since late December, the last 3 weeks in Vietnam. Heading from Mui Ne down to Vung Tau tomorrowYou won't find any posts on here by me, saying I'm anxious, worried, scared etc, because I'm just enjoying my holiday, just like all the people already here are too"
"Colette I'm due to leave for Siem Reap and then Phu quoc in 2 weeks, can you update how things are going in Vietnam just to have the right info to take my decision.thanks"
"I find things rather calm. Yesterday there was a conference held in Ho Chi Minh btmy the American Chamber of Commerce and the CDC. Basically saying things are calm in Vietnam. A side note health care is very expensive in Vietnam and most Vietnimite citizens (especially the poor.. Most if the population) would not go to the hospital if they are feeling sick...which is an interesting thought but.. It also is true that there are no deaths in Vietnam from the virus.Axreally interesting objective site is Vietnam Briefing that is written by budibess consultants here in VN.. Advising those international groups with businesses here.Remember also there is censorship in Vietnam..All that said.. We gave been more relaxed since we gave arrived. We are wearing masks. We also are washing hands often, have gel for those moments without water and also gave brought alcohol wipes. We are not obsessing tho."

"Is there any recent news on the people quarantined in Da Nang at end of January?Have trip booked end of Feb (to Laos too). Don't want to cancel as i lose all the flight, but guess I'll wait another week..."
"What are the airports like right now, in particular Hue (Phu Bai) and Luang Prabang (Laos) - crowded (or not) with longer waits in queues due to screening cautions being implemented? Are there noticeably fewer people in Hanoi and other airports? Wonder what the energy will be like by March 1. Maybe, it is hard to say. If this crisis is actually getting under control, will the tourists from China be allowed to come back in (like normal) to Vietnam? Anyone telepathic?"
"Stockport 1965. We are in HCMC and yes, everything is open and working normally. We wear masks in busy places like markets, but otherwise we don't bother. Lots of people out and about and concern seems minimal."
Keep us updated with your vietnam trip. I'm going in two weeks and still debating if I should go or not.
"We’re in the same situation. I’m not worried about the death rates which are very low. However, iam concerned about the chance of being quarantined as I live with a cough and am an OAP, the quarantine conditions look like hell. A good number of the sites we want to see would be crowded and we don’t want to miss them out.Hence, We’ve decided to postpone until autumn. We plan to ask our GP for a note advising us not to go on health grounds and hope the insurance Company pay up."
"Update.. I’m in Vietnam in HCM! Things are quite dandy here but it’s my first time here and the car smog and humid weather are overwhelming?! But those are the only things. Many people are out & about but just wearing masks. Many people aren’t even wearing them. Life goes on as normal. Streets are super crowded and I see lots of tourists. We have been to markets, tourist attractions, and restaurants. Aside from the weather, we’re enjoying ourselves because everything is cheap. Even got mani pedis!! I’m going along with my tour. Next stops... Da Nang, Hanoi, Hoi An, Ha Long Bay...Edited: 6:26 am, February 08, 2020 "
Are the businesses still open or are they fearful and closing?
"I'm booked to take part in a cycling trip across Vietnam- starting on Feb 15th. All reports suggest masks, schools closed and new hospitals being created. I'm not keen. To drop out will be costly but …."
Schools in at least 26 of Vietnam's 64 provinces were closed on Monday (Feb 3) following a government directive shuttering them for seven days in an attempt to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.Can't find any info on new hospitals.. They are building hospitals in China.Most Asian countries wear face masks regardless of the coronavirus... And I am flying out on the 22/02...unless the foreign office advise otherwise I will still go... There's more coronavirus is other countries than Vietnam.
Thanks. Contact over there tells me warehouses being adapted. One close to where he lives. Most nervous about overnight train journey tbh. One person on train positive and rest of us quarantined ? Gulp !
"I have travelled through Vietnam on their trains... Much like China and India they are old, and not particularly high hygiene standards.Equip yourself with good hygiene products, antibac gel, take sensible and effective procautions and you will be fine. I have sorted out masks to take... To wear in busy congested areas... But generally you have as much chance catching corona on a train in York.."
Julie D and Philip C - There is a link somewhere to the article on hospitals. I'll try find it. I think it's more for quarantining Vietnamese people coming back from China...
Hanoi schools are closed for another week.
"Cancel the trip, if you do not get coronavirus you are sure to get the usual diarrhea in Vietnam anyway so why risk it. Just go to Korea and at least hang out in a country where you can get potable water out of the sink. Oh crapping in the park is super traditional behavior in Vietnam not at all in Korea so go there if avoiding sickness is your concern."
I'm doing this same trip at the same time with connection in S Korea then on to Vietnam. Thank you for asking the question! We've been contemplating it too!
Your response is irrelevant and reckless and not applicable to the feed!
https:/…https:/…52844.htmljust makes perfect sense
"Completely ridiculous ! Which tourist drinks tap water in a tropical country .??? Mineral water is for sale in Vietnam even in the tiniest remote mountain village. Besides, I have news for you : tap water is perfectly drinkable in large Vietnamese towns. I live since 2007 in Hanoi and roam constantly the country, I have never had one diarrhea in 13 years !"

Is Da lat safe from the coronavirus at present?
I don't think you can categorically say any where is safe.
Have not seen any reports of anyone catching it in Dalat.
"My flights to SGN with ANA are scheduled to leave today (in 10 hours) and flighthub is telling me I cannot change the dates because ANA doesn’t fly to SGN with layover in NRT anymore but Haneda and if I want to change, it has to be NRT because it has to be exactly the same as my current itinerary (except for the dates), so I will loose the rt whole ticket if I don’t go. I heard SGN airport is currently crowded with people trying to get back to the US earlier than planned and they are willing to pay a premium for a new one way ticket. Schools are closed until 2/16/20. People are advised to stay home and avoid crowds. So It won’t be fun for anyone to go there at this time ... I hope they will issue a travel advisory for VN soon.Edited: 12:13 am, February 10, 2020 "

"Hi,We have a organised trip scheduled by the end of March for 3 weeks.During the trip we visit places like Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hué, Hoi An, Dalat, Ho Chi Minh City.Most of the trip we will travel by a tourbus but we will also be staying on a nighttrain, which is a concern for us if something happens like on the cruise ship.We are a bit worried if we should cancel the trip, our tour operator says it is currently safe and if we cancel now we will still have to pay like 50% of our trip. No idea what we should do :-("
"HiIt’s so difficult as know one can predict what will happen. Like many posts have already said its a personal choice at the moment, and you have to do what’s right for you. We also had a similar trip booked mid March but decided to cancel as just didn’t want the worry of maybe being quarantined, having to wear masks etc etc. We also were going to lose 50% of the cost but we rebooked a different holiday for the same period and our travel agent reduced the cancellation charge considerably.... if you do decide not to go this may be an option for you too if you discuss this with your travel agent . Good luck :)"
"Thanks Mr. Olive. There is a lot of paranoia over this. My wife and I are heading to Hanoi in 2 weeks, and then on to Mai Chau, Ninh Binh and Hoi An. I'm guessing the rural areas will be less affected than the cities? true? Also, I'm looking forward to fewer crowds but am also hoping that places like the Old Quarter are not deserted. Do you have any knowledge of what things are like in Hanoi in the touristy areas?"
"Thanks for the update Joanna. Hope you keep posting because my wife and I are heading to Hanoi in 2 weeks, then Mai Chau, Ninh Binh and Hoi An. It is nice to get updates from people who are there. I am not worried about the Coronavirus. People in the US should worry more about the flu that has infected 19 million and killed 10,000. Group think is quite interesting."
Vietnam immigrant denied my visa on arrival application due to my flights from SFO-TPE-HAN. The tour agency wants me to book another flight that transits through ICN instead. Make sure you can enter/exit your countries before you decide to take your trip.
"Interesting. We have an approved eVisa. Our flight goes from Seattle to Taipei to Hanoi. I have not heard of the Vietnamese govt denying entrance to visitors from Taipei, but I will check it out."
PS the Vietnam govt briefly banned flights from Taiwan to Vietnam about a week ago and then reversed their decision. I wonder if your application landed during that ban?
> I wonder if your application landed during that ban?They don't ask /where/ you are flying in from. Only *where* you will enter Vietnam.
Good point. They wouldn’t deny a Visa based on flight plans since they don’t know how you are getting there and from which airport.

Looks pretty vacant. The reduced crowds might be a plus when visiting certain sites
"Currently in Hue at the moment and it is really quiet. The Tombs and Citadel are pretty empty, restaurants are quiet but life goes on. Everything is still running as normal, people wear masks in busy areas but that's about it. I'm glad i didn't cancel my trip"
"I did not apply during the Taiwan travel ban period. My trip departs on Feb 20th. I am applying for a multiple entry visa on arrival so that may be different from the single entry evisa. I have received helpful information from this post and want to share my experience. Use as a caution as each of our situation may be different.Here is what the tour agency sent to me today.“Currently, due to the corona disease, the Immigration Department requires us to provide flight information (flight ticket/flight itinerary) of the customer. The flight you booked before (attachment) is still on schedule but not accepted by the Immigration Department.”"
"Interesting. Thank you.mi am surprised that the immigration dept is not accepting the flight. Currently, there are 275 flights per week between Taiwan and Vietnam"
"This thread is pure gold. The post below this is just fantastic.For anyone who this may help, I was in Hanoi on the 2nd/3rd/4th and it was anything but deserted.

Unless the travel company cancels then we're still going and we can't wait. We'll just make sure we take wipes and anti bac stuff as we usually do. We were advised by a friend who is a flight attendant to always wipe down your area around you - tray, arms, back of the seat etc. - on the flight too (no matter where you fly)"

The tricky part is make sure you don't catch even a mild cold on your journey that may result to quarantine for 14 days.
Visitors are not being quarantined for 14 days based only on a simple cold

We were suppose to leave for Vietnam and Cambodia on 2/23 but have canceled. We lost some money but not worth the risk. There is always next year.
Jenn so after all these responses are you going we will be going in march based on all the official reports and feedback from travelers actually in Vietnam right now
Those of us traveling in the coming days and weeks Will probably look back on what a blessing it was for us to be able to see all the sites that we visited without the humongous crowds. There have been many reports about over tourism and crowding in Southeast Asia. The fear over the coronavirus has fixed that at least for now. I have no concerns about picking up the coronavirus and look forward to being able to travel in a much less crowded environment.
Hi We will be travelling end of March How are you feeling about it all ?
"I posted earlier about Ho Chi Minh City. People were taking precautions which is good. We are healthy so we came on our trip. I am so glad we did! We are currently a little North of Phan Rang. We took the train here. No issues. This country is beautiful. My relative is keeping an eye on Hanoi because it is closer to China. We would like to hear from anyone there. Also we are hearing the cruises for Halong Bay are often cancelled do to less tourists. Anyone have direct knowledge? We are finding that the news over reacts and scares people. If you are healthy, I would go. Just take same precautions as flu and colds. Wash hands often. I am so glad we didn’t cancel."
Some 242 deaths from the new coronavirus were recorded in the Chinese province of Hubei on Wednesday - the deadliest day of the outbreak. (bbc.com)Nobody is panicking ...yet...
Will the US government make it difficult for you to enter the country when you return to the US after traveling in Vietnam?
"We had stayed in the south.. Canceled our portion from DaNang up to Hanoi. Happy we did. The first city near Hanoi was put under quarentine today.. Many are expected to follow. It us important to remember that health care is ""expensive"" for the Vietnamita... Thus few will go to a hospital if they are ill... Thus reporting has only been if cases that have gone to hospital... Wealthy enough to afford it. The cases in the city that is now quarentined were reported by a businessman that said many people seemed ill there."

"Update... I’m in Hoi An, and am supposed to fly to Hanoi tomorrow. We heard that a city near Hanoi was quarantined. We are canceling our trips to Hanoi and Ha Long Bay cruise to fly home directly from Da Nang. We told the tour and are booking tickets soon. I have been having stomach issues with the food here I believe... my stomach has issues every 2-3 days (and usually it’s totally normal at home). I have been here for 8 days and don’t want to get worse and have to go to the hospital or get quarantined. Not really worried about getting coronavirus (although that’s a valid possibility) and we really wanted to enjoy our cruise but with my stomach issues, it’s not working out. I take medication for it but it still hurts 2-3 days afterwards again. Overall we enjoyed our trip! Da Nang is pretty quiet and in Hoi An it is hot and almost nobody is wearing masks. We haven’t been either, but we try not to talk to anyone else or stand close to them"

The US State Department still has an advisory for normal travel to/from Vietnam. I don’t anticipate issues returning to US. Someone on this thread indicated a cost for Vietnamese to go to the hospital. The government is telling people there will be no cost for going to the hospital for the virus.

When I landed the Q at immigration was short, hardly anyone wears masks apart from the Vietnamese people on their scooters and some working at tourist spots. To be honest I’m considering getting a mask just for the scooter fumes here. The government have distributed lots of advice on preventative measures so there are hand washing facilities popping up at bus stations etc, public toilets are very clean. I’m using hand sanitizer as I normally would.

Hi Slav any updates How is the feeling while you are actually there
"Hi johnchippendale2,It feels good. Life goes as usual. A lot of local people are wearing face masks, but most of the European looking tourists - not. Hanoi is amazing, really enjoying it."
No new cases reported in the last three days. Out of the 16 reported cases 7 have left hospital. Most schools are still closed and authorities seem to be doing a good job in controlling things. Not a bad time to visit.
"Corona virus is not Ebola, it's a new kind on ""influenza"", so it will go away like normal influenza end of february.Influenza will come again in december , coronavirus included, not enough time for a vaccine and our body never had contact with coronavirus so no protection at all, but it will end up not so deadly, they cannot count people like the brit that had no problems apart infecting dozen friends.I would not get on a cruise ship next winter...."
Hi I have plan to travel to Vietnam Hanoi city on 18 Feb. is it safe to go there on account of Coronavirus? Pls replyThx
Has anyone heard any update on the people who were hospitalised in Da Nang in January? Any more cases there?And how about Son Loi?
It's as safe as anywhere else in the world.The UK government are NOT advising against travel to Vietnam. They are giving advice on hygiene and sanitation to keep yourself safe. No reason at the moment to cancel plans... I am travelling at the weekend.

"Has anyone flown to Vietnam through Taiwan recently? I am scheduled to fly through Taipei on my way to Hanoi on March 17th. Of course, I know things can change, but my understanding right now is that this should be ok? My worry is less about the virus itself and more about getting quarantined for transiting in Taipei. If anyone has taken this route recently or can point to some information it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
Thank you Slav your ongoing feedback is much appreciated Enjoy your trip
"Panic is dying because everyone got accustomed to this news. Nothing is new like it was at the end of January. But people dying and dying more then in January.About flight through Taipei I will let you know. I fly that rout in 2 weeks. Let's think how can I contact you with information. When I am on my trip, I will be not here at this forum."
I would really appreciate that marinkaB! I am sending you a direct message.
"MarinkaB and MartinM - I'm also flying through Taipei on March 21. Been monitoring the news and so far, US is still showing normal precautions for Taiwan and Vietnam...would love any updates as it gets closer from those on the ground."
We flew into Hanoi on the 15th and you can definitely notice locals wearing masks but rarely any tourists in fact we’ve seen parents with children here without masks. It feels like the city is fairly quiet but you will see people out and about. The few excursions we’ve done have been fantastic because they haven’t been crowded and you get to enjoy the locations a lot more. If you feel that the virus threat will weigh on your mind perhaps rebook your trip but otherwise it’s fine here. We’re currently going to Ninh Bin right now so we’ll see how dead the parks there will be like.
"I flew through Taipei. Got through without getting quarantined. There are multiple CDC stations and many employees wearing bright CDC jackets. They have you fill out a quick questionnaire and as long as you don’t look sick or fatigued when you walk by them, you should be ok. Nobody stopped us and we walked right past. But they are definitely observing people."
"Thank you for this information Joanna! If you don't mind me asking, what was the date you flew through Taipei?"
February 14
"Currently at the airport leaving Hanoi to go to HCM. Basically no tourists are wearing masks in Hanoi, halong bay or tam Coc. All our guides have told us it's worse than low season right now for tourist numbers. It was mandatory to wear masks when we visited Viet Hai in halong bay (tour guide provided masks) and we were also asked to wear them while exchanging money on ha Trang street in one of the shops there. That's about it though."
"We have a trip to Hanoi planned for March 1. What is the mood where you are? Are local people anxious?ThanksEdited: 12:01 am, February 18, 2020 "
"My co-worker just got back from Vietnam. He had a 10 hour layover in Taipei and went out and explored the city. He was questioned when he entered Vietnam about his time in Taiwan, but he was allowed to enter the country. Other than that, he said that just about everyone was wearing masks. A couple of his Airbnb's cancelled on him, but everything else went smoothly. They did take his temp when he landed in Taipei and had him fill out a form, but he was allowed back in the U.S. and is at work today. We are leaving for HCMC in three days and completely looking forward to it."
"Thank you for posting this! It's reassuring. My layover is also about 10 hours, but I think I might just stay airside to be safe. I love Taipei, but I've already seen it a few times. Happy to hear that there were no issues and enjoy your trip! Let us know how it is if you can."
Nothing is really closed except the border afaik. I just went on a motorbike street food tour with XO Tours in Saigon and it was fine.
"Just back from a 10 day trip from Vietnam visiting north, central and south Vietnam.Mood here is pretty ok. All activities are functional.Lots of local wearing masks especially taxi drivers.Lots of places have a very few tourists so its great to really enjoy and have your own time and spaceAirports are busy as usual with HCMC Airport was super busy with immigration with lots of touristsHoi an was super busy as well with almost all cafes and restaurants atleast half full.Saw loads of tourists at Halong bay and in Hanoi"
"I'm in the same position - not worried about catching coronavirus but not sure how much of a fun holiday we are going to have in the current situation. Some of the things we wanted to do in Hong Kong (i.e. cable cars) have already been closed due to the virus. I have been planning our trip to Hong Kong and Vietnam for nearly a year but I would rather go when we can actually enjoy it, rather than things being closed, stress travelling through airports and everyone being worried."
"you will never find a better time to see the popular sites with such few tourists. Yes, there is some disruption to the local restaurants etc, but compare that to the throng of crowds that are at the temples, pagodas, and other popular sites. It is a trade off, but one that favors a visit, in my opinion."
"This was my viewpoint up until yesterday - I was looking forward to there being a distinct lack of other tourists! However, after Cathay cancelled my flight to HK on Sunday, I've decided to postpone the trip for now - 3 weeks in HK and Vietnam has cost me too much money to potentially not have a great time."
I understand.
are the night markets open in Hanoi?
"Viet Nam announces today that they only have one patient left in treatment.All other patients had been released from the hospital.This news article is in Vietnamese, but I'm sure there's one in English somewhere out there.https://tuoitre.vn/viet-nam-chi-con-1-benh-n…Cheers,John"

"Jay@472, so true. I booked my ticket Jan'20 flying early Feb and proceed to do so without canceling it. It's entirely for each to decide (based on your own situation to assess) and either to proceed or cancel.Edited: 10:37 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"There have been very few cases in Vietnam. All patients have tested negative with the virus and made a full recovery, so it is safe to carry out your plan and head to this country.Indochina Pioneer"
"@thomasr when we were there a few days ago they were closed. But beer street was still open and there was a nightlife scene. The Hoi An night market is open, we were there last night and it was full of tourists."
Viet 1. What is it like now? Should we be postponing?
"We have been travelling North to South Vietnam by motorbike since the 6th February. Areas before we arrived have since been quarantined. However, the numbers are small and the same as Australia. Our advice would be to travel, watch WHO, avoid risk areas where Coronavirus is starting to spread and take precautions such as washing hands regularly, use mouthwash and wear a mask in busy areas. At this stage you’re more likely to be affected by Malaria than the Coronavirus. Have fun and be safe."
"Second day in Hanoi and everything seems normal, locals going about their business and tourist enjoying the scene as we are,. So glad we didn't postpone our tour"
"Do you actually notice anything related to corona? Is everybody wearing masks or is it not that notable?I am scheduled for April 18. Not so much scared for the virus, but more curious to hear if the street scene is at least somewhat ‘normal’.Thanks!"
Reached today at Ho Chi.. Everything is simply normal. Walking street is all crowded. Hardly 1% population wearing Masks. So far so good.
"We are scheduled to travel Mar. 9-24. Visiting Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An, Ninh Binh and Halong Bay. Has anyone been in the Ninh Binh area? Has anyone flown through Seoul? We are reading lots of reports that virus in S. Korea is causing gov't crackdowns. Not worried about the virus, more worried about logistics, quarantines etc... thanks"
Cancellation.
We are booked for April 6 2020 to do Mekong. What is your update
We’ve been to Ninh Bin and it was totally fine. Lots of tourists there and no one was really wearing any masks.
All quite normal here with everyone going about doing there daily routine. No new cases in over a week. Fingers crossed that it will stay that way.
We just left Hoi An and are now in Da Nang. Everything is open. We are so glad we came on our trip. It has been incredible. Met tons of nice people. If you go to Hoi An we highly recommend http://www.lantanahoian.com/home.htm for a hotel. A quaint hotel with awesome staff! If you are healthy I would do your trip. I think we actually had a better trip without all the mass tourists.
"Hi, I am planning to visit from 15th - 31st March, with a layover of 21 hours in Singapore. Problem I think is I have kid of 1.5 years old. I am not sure whether to cancel or not."
"""Hi, I am planning to visit from 15th - 31st March, with a layover of 21 hours in Singapore. Problem I think is I have kid of 1.5 years old. I am not sure whether to cancel or not.""So is it the 21 hours in Singapore that worries you?Or the fact that you have 1.5 year old kid?And will the opinions of complete strangers on the internet help you decide?Scott"
"We are a week out from our first trip to Vietnam and can’t wait! Our one concern is that our layover is in South Korea: with the uptick in cases we are trying to prepare in the possibility of it getting to a point where travelers coming through there wouldn’t be allowed into Vietnam. If this decision were made, where would that info first be published (just so we can keep an eye on it this week and be ready to make alternate plans ASAP). Thanks so much!"
"The scene is normal, only difference is hotels and some resturants have hand sanitiser and a few westerners wearing masks"
"Sbc930, that is exactly our dilemma right now! Also worried about having the South Korea history on our passports for re entering The US. We planned to leave the airport but are definitely closing monitoring. Seems OK right now, but we have concerns about if it intensifies while we are there."
"""ur one concern is that our layover is in South Korea: with the uptick in cases we are trying to prepare in the possibility of it getting to a point where travelers coming through there wouldn’t be allowed into Vietnam"" The numbers in South Korea are concerning but a lot of them seem to surround a cult and a specific part of south korea. Of course its day by day at this point and if the virus continues to spread there then I think your concerns about how Vietnam will react to travelers coming from there is a legitimate concern, especially since they can change their policies rather suddenly."
I'm in the same boat. Scheduled to fly in early April. I'm sitting on the fence for a little while longer but I'm leaning towards cancelling
We just cancelled our trip that was scheduled for March 1 as transiting through Seoul right now seems uncertain for those reasons others have posted. I am so bummed!!
"""We just cancelled our trip that was scheduled for March 1 as transiting through Seoul right now seems uncertain for those reasons others have posted."" - there was no option to route through somewhere else?"
I leave Friday going through Seoul. Haven’t considered cancelling and cant say I am concerned.
"GlobeMT, can you please post about how it was flying through there?"
"We did it yesterday the MEKONG DELTA.. Excellent.. No sign of any fear of the virus. All normalEdited: 8:39 pm, February 23, 2020 "
Sure thing. Feel free to contact me as well. I leave Friday night and arrive Sunday morning.
May have quarantine if you visit Republic of Korea. vietnamnews.vn/society/612616/vietnamese-adv…
Ok now that I see Bamboo Airlines cancelled flights between South Korea and Vietnam I am a bit more concerned...

"Have the prices dropped in hotels, tours?"
"@Anna C @SBC930 I'm in the same situation as you guys. My trip to Vietnam is scheduled for 3/13 flying with Korean Airlines (""KAL"") from NY to SGN with a layover in Incheon, Korea. While the coronavirus is obviously concerning my biggest worry is the logistics. Albeit I'm flying with KAL, I booked my flights via Delta and they have offered 100% refunds. I'm going to continue to monitor the situation for the next few days before making a decision. What are you guys doing to do?"
"@dee202 thanks for providing the article! If Vietnam does issue quarantine, hopefully as the article mentioned its only against RoK citizens and Vietnamese citizens."
follow up from us--- Our Flight is serviced by Asiana Airlines through Air Canada and it looks like they have suspended all flights from Seoul to Hanoi between now and March 9. Technically we land on March 10. I am on hold with the airlines now and hopefully they can give us some information.... we might be leaning towards cancelling and/or we might not have a choice. : (
"Ready spaghetti- I understand it’s only the citizens but if one person has a fever, the whole plane is quarantined. I was to fly into Hong Kong on Feb 6 on route to Vietnam. I wanted to pay $200 to reroute through South Korea...in a matter of weeks, South Korea becomes an epicentre. Kuwait airlines is not going to South Korea or Italy. These are drastic measures I know but it’s a daily Russian roulette as to which areas will become hotspots. Vietnam is sounding pretty safe right now."
@Anna C - awww man what a bummer! sorry to hear! Any possibility of rescheduling to another date as I am exploring that option. Keep us informed!@dee2020 - ahh good point. I too agree that Vietnam is sounding pretty safe right now! I was concerned with Vietnam because they share a border with China but seems like they're doing a pretty good job re coronavirus.
"FYI- Singapore Airlines published a much longer list of cancelled flights today, many into and out of Vietnam which until today were scheduled to fly. This seems to be in response to low traveler numbers and not a reflection of concern in Vietnam, yet it will still affect many travelers (us included for our upcoming trip )https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/media…Edited: 5:30 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"Hi @AnnaC - very interested in your answer. have same itinerary but supposed to leave in 2 days. i am seeing conflicting information about cancellations (that they'd previously shut down this route over a week ago, but hadn't actually). let us know what the airline says?!"
"@Graham G... That's interesting. I called Air Canada and it wasn't the *most* helpful. I originally clicked on the link below.... I'm trying to see what airlines and also airports are posting... so then if you scroll down to where it says ""Notice for suspension/reduction on selected routes"" and click on it, it shows Seoul to Hanoi is suspended until March 9 but the customer service gal said that my flight wasn't cancelled. (Leaving March 9). I'm currently looking up similar flights departing tomorrow on Air Canada serviced by Asiana Airlines, and they aren't showing as cancelled from what I can see. The link was published on Friday, so maybe they redacted the ban but haven't since updated?? To be honest, the girl sounded exhausted and confused and started going on a rant about refunds for Carnivale in Venice... So.......... I'm at square 1. https:/…"
"Thanks for posting this, we are booked to fly to Singapore from Brisbane then to Danang at the end of June, looks like it will only take a couple more weeks and our flights will be cancelled."
"Was really hoping this whole thing settles down before our flight 4 March (3 days in Singapore then 14 days Vietnam), but with latest rapid development in S.Korea, Italy and Iran we are thinking moving our trip to November/December this year. Not scared of virus as much, but don't want to get stuck somewhere or worse get quarantined etc.As we want to visit HCMC, Hoi An, Halong Bay and Hanoi I don't know which months would be better? From what I understand March is pretty good, any other month is good for all three regions?"
"Hey Guys Is anyone booked to tour Vietnam on a Webjet ,AVG tour We are booked to fly to Vietnam for on a Webjet tour thru their travel partner AVG group. we are not so worried about catching the virus but more concerned about being stuck in Vietnam due to flight delays, cancellations etc Does anyone have any information or thoughts on how the urs may be impacted We have comprehensive travel insurance but cannot always trust this with flight delays on tour groups"
"We are due to travel to Singapore then onto Da Nang on April 11th from the UK, long way to go and the travel advice is non existent."
"""....and the travel advice is non existent.""If you're talking from your Government, then that would probably be a good thing?No advice = no / very little cause for concern?Scott"
Does anybody have further Information concerning these news?https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-su…
"@30000Tage yeah, we saw it hit level 3 travel status in South Korea last night and knew this was coming. Was somewhat expecting an email from the airline this morning but not yet.. Thinking about calling to re route through Tokyo, but not not confident that will be better in a few weeks.. Certainly not flying for 30 hours only to be turned around at the airport in Hanoi at this point. Anyone else receive communications about their flights ?"
"Does ist only affect South Korea or - as it says in the article - all countries that have had corona cases? If so, our travel plans for next week might change drastically.."
I have not heard from my airline cancelling the flight yet but have cancelled my trip going through Seoul. I was supposed to leave Friday and was not worried this past weekend but things have progressed significantly. The level 3 CDC warning for South Korea was the final straw. Interestingly I also had my cooking class in Hoi An cancelled this morning as they are shutting down for a month due to Coronavirus. This is all terribly disappointing as we were so looking forward to this trip and really thought this was all blown out of proportion.
"""Does ist only affect South Korea or - as it says in the article - all countries that have had corona cases?"". I would also like to know, the article is a bit confusing. What if your country only had 3 infections, will they still not allow you in? It sounds a bit drastic, seeing that they are already losing from a lack of tourism."
"We have a group of 5 schedule to fly to Hanoi on March 28.Two people go through South Korea. The rest of us through Taiwan.I'm worried most about two things:1. The people going through South Korea, wondering if that situation will be as bad in 1 month. Anyone have insight?2. Just the overall vibe in Vietnam. If it's quiet and abnormal in a month, there's no reason not to wait until the fall. Our expenses so far are like 80% refundable. What would others do in this situation?We currently are waiting until next week to cancel anything."
"@Anna C - My trip is on 3/13 and I haven't received any communication from my airline or hotel. From my own efforts, I know Korean Airlines suspended flights from Seoul to Hanoi and limited flights from Seoul to Da Nang/Nha Trang. So far no cancellation between Seoul and Ho Chi Minh yet. I too was thinking of rerouting my flight to Tokyo vs Seoul but I don't think it'll be worth it. It seems there's a lot of cancellation for flights between Seoul and Hanoi but I haven't seen any cancellations for flights between Seoul and Ho Chi Minh (""HCMC""). Although I did read that HCMC is considering making all travelers from South Korea sign a health declaration form and/or quarantine for 14 days. However I'm not sure if that applies to non South Korean residents. I still haven't decided whether or not to cancel or reschedule. Every day there is some new development."
"Bros, who knows what will be in one month? Who knows... No one knows what it would be in one week. I plan to go on March 3, but.. I have OCD :) It would be a nightmare for my husband. I prepared a lot of antibacterial wipers. Will wipe EVERYTHING. and wash my hands a lot. It is a problem to get masks. I asked on my FB page for masks, many my friends gave me some. Someone gave 3 masks, someone 9 masks, someone 40 :)"
this is exactly why I just canceled my flight on April 1 from JFK>>Taiwan>>Saigon... I am not scared of the actual virus...However things could change at any moment and I cannot risk being quarantined somewhere...I am aware that on any given normal day anything could happen however the risk is definitely higher at this point in time.
Trying to keep perspective... A school five miles away from here (in Devon) have just returned from a school trip to North Italy. The students are now in home quarantine. A mother of one of the students popped into my husbands shop today to buy anti bac hand wash and told him all about it - just saying this to say that it’s not safe anywhere really ! I won’t be cancelling our flights until someone tells me I have to.
"I am supposed to fly this saturday feb 29 through South Korea to HCMC. We are so looking forward to our trip but what is life on the ground like? Is everyone wearing masks and scared? are markets happening? are locals avoiding crowded areas? WE are supposed to be in HCMC, Hoi An, Hanoi, Halong Bay.... If ayone is there now can you chime in and let us know what it's like??"
Im in the same boat.... supposed to leave saturday and fly seoul to HCMC..... can't tell if it's overblown or if it will be weird and quiet? will there be markets? does anyone want to be in crowded areas?? it's so frustrating that the airlines wont reroute us!
"Just from reading prior posts and being in this thread for a week or so now, it seems like the culture in Vietnam is normal and enjoyable... If you're not worried about getting through Seoul and/or being denied entry back into the US after the recent outbreak this past weekend ... then go for it.. the logistics and government crack downs are our only draw back right now.."
"@melglo - Vietnam seems ok. It's getting through Seoul that can be an issue. The CDC raised security level to 3 for South Korea. Also Vietnam seems to be putting restrictions for flights coming from South Korea:https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-su…As a lot of folks have mentioned in the forum, the biggest concern is logistics. I'm not actually too concerned about the coronavirus. But the last thing I want is to arrive in Vietnam after flying for 23 hours then having to get quarantined for x amount of days or sent back to the US."
This year I made a mistake... Should plan to go to South America. Instead got Vietnam and 2 times Italy. I very hope that coronavirus chills out when spring comes.
I am leaving tomorrow for Hanoi through Taipei. Talked to my travel person who said that she has many clients in Vietnam and it is business as usual and they are having a great time.
That travel person will sing you anything. They need money to pay bills. Do you really thinking that person would tell you to cancel your trip?
"Please, let us know how Taipei looks like."
"Can someone help to interpret this excerpt from the article I included below? I am traveling from the USA, transiting through Doha. The USA has reported cases, but Doha has not. Feeling a bit confused right now.""No person coming from any area that has experienced a Covid-19 outbreak will be allowed to enter Vietnam, the PM directed Tuesday.Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the Foreign Affairs Ministry to apply the new policy to South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran and all other countries and territories that have reported cases of Covid-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus.""https:/…"
"I can’t cancel at this point, so there is no financial benefit to her. She has been very honest with me through my travel planning. Also, I spoke with others in Hanoi, including hotel staff who have confirmed what she told me."
If the link above from TravelingThruEurope then even if take the risk we can't travel to Vietnam as we going trough Singapore and both Singapore and Australia has cases?
"@ErnJay, exactly. That is what is so darn confusing with the article I posted. I follow several Vietnamese news outlets and I have not read about these restrictions anywhere else. Even on Vietnam's tourism board website.I'm hoping someone can clarify this."
Found this on Korean Airlines website for travel restrictions for Vietnam:- Foreign nationals who have visited Daegu/Gyeongbuk in Korea within 14 days will be denied entry of Vietnam or be quarantined for 14 days after arrival. (as of Feb 26)- Foreign nationals who have stayed in China in recent 14 days from arrival date will be refused entry.https:/…2020_02_TSA_detail.html
Oof. We are scheduled to fly out this weekend (our flight to Hanoi via a layover in Seoul). Struggling so hard with what to do/if we even will have a choice in the matter in a few days. Wishing desperately there was a straight shot flight from NYC to Vietnam right now. Definitely tough to think about not getting to go right now since we wouldn't have another opening for at least a year... Bouncing back and forth about what to do--know if we could make it to Vietnam without getting stopped for any reason we'd have a lovely time there--but would definitely hate to have to go through quarantine when we return if the situation shifts more.
"NO flights delays or cancellations, but flights between China and Vietnam are banned except from hong kong. As for the press article, to my knowledge, the Government has published no list of the countries . As of today, ZERO case here"
"@SBC930 - I couldn't agree with you more. I wish there was a direct flight to Vietnam from NYC! From what I know, I think the real challenge is the flight between Seoul and Vietnam. While South Korea is considered level 3 by the CDC, the state department still categorized South Korea level two. Since you're departing from NYC I'm assuming you're arriving into NYC as well and NYC is one of the 11 ports in the US that's capable to screen. For now, it seems only foreign nationals that have visited Daegu/Gyeongbuk in Korea within 14 days have travel restrictions in Vietnam. Wishing you all the best and keep us posted on what you decide!"
"It definitely does not look good for connecting flights from Seoul to Hanoi. If Asiana Airlines have already cancelled flights until March 9, the odds of flying soon after that seem highly unlikely. Which sucks big time as I would still love to go on my first vacation to Vietnam. I believe the odds of catching the virus are very low. But as people have mentioned it would suck big time, to go so far only to be refused entry into Vietnam.I understand that things are changing rapidly with this unfortunate issue but hope the airlines can let us know soon what's up.Anna C, please let us know when you find any news regarding the Seoul- Hanoi flight as I am in the same boat as you are. Plus if the flight is cancelled can we get a full refund or how does that work?I have had 2 changes to my flights already and it looks like another one is coming soon. Might just have to bite the bullet and cancel this time if I have that option."
"@nomad7765 we are in the process of cancelling all hotels, tours, cruise etc. I am so upset. This has been a horrible decision and not easy for us at all. Even if S. Korea and Vietnam work it out in the next week and we are allowed free access into the country... we ultimately decided that we just don’t want the constant pressure to be checking the news and updates everyday on our trip. Conditions could easily change for better or worse but we want to be off our phones and completely on vacation. We are experienced travelers, but with heightened response from the US to the imminent spread, we personally feel we wont have the same experience as planned until this passes... but that’s our recent decision and I am still worried I will regret this cancellation. I wish everyone the best travel decision for them. In regards to flight refund, we aren’t offered that at this time as our flight connection isn’t cancelled. We are offered free re-booking if we want to travel between now and June 15 on the same itinerary. I am literally taking a “sick” day off work to fight with airlines on Thursday on getting a voucher.Edited: 12:11 am, February 26, 2020 "
"This is our last day in Vietnam. Loved our vacation. Yes, people are washing hands and using sanitizer hand stuff. The Vietnam government is posting info on the correct way to use face masks. I seriously feel safer here than the US. The Government is taking this seriously here. We will be returning thru Tokyo. We will take precautions with cleaning our airline seats. Business as normal in HCMC, Phan Rang, Na Tran, Hui, Hoi An, Na Dang. I would worry more about travel restrictions than not having fun in Vietnam."
"Could someone translate this paragraph from official vietnamese page? I've tried Google translate but it looks quite far off.2. Đối với người nhập cảnh từ các vùng có dịch của Hàn Quốc và từ vùng có dịch của vùng lãnh thổ, các nước khác:a) Bộ Ngoại giao:- Thông báo ngay cho phía Hàn Quốc và các nước, vùng lãnh thổ có dịch COVID-19 về các biện pháp phòng, chống dịch mà Việt Nam áp dụng trong đó có việc tạm dừng nhập cảnh Việt Nam đối với người đến từ hoặc đi qua vùng có dịch, đối với các đối tượng nhập cảnh vì mục đích công vụ trong trường hợp đặc biệt phải khai báo y tế, cách ly tập trung 14 ngày theo quy định.- Thông báo cho công dân Việt Nam không đến các vùng có dịch ở các nước, trừ trường hợp cần thiết, nếu vẫn đi thì khi nhập cảnh Việt Nam sẽ phải cách ly tập trung 14 ngày theo quy định."
"Anna,Yeah it sucks, we were looking forward this trip so much as well, now cancelling all hotels and moving our trip to March 2021 (Singapore Air agreed to change dates).I understand what other people are saying that it's safe and no need to panic, but I don't think any..one really knows what is going on yet.Vietnam will still be there next year and many year after.."
"@Daumantas P. It is translated as follow using Google translate:For people who enter from epidemic areas of Korea and from epidemic areas of territories or other countries: a) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs: - Immediately notify Korea and other countries and territories where COVID-19 epidemic is being imposed on measures to prevent and control epidemics that Vietnam has applied, including suspending entry into Vietnam for people coming from or leaving Vietnam. through epidemic areas, for those who enter for official purposes in special cases, they must have medical declaration and concentrated isolation for 14 days as prescribed. - Notify Vietnamese citizens who do not go to epidemic areas in other countries, except in case of necessity, if they still go, when they enter Vietnam, they will have to be concentrated in isolation for 14 days as prescribed."
"Interesting to see how it pans out. From the translation would that mean any country that has had at least 1 confirmed? (aka Australia)Edited: 6:57 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Oh yeah ? We LIVE in Vietnam, so, believe me, we KNOW what's going on here."
"Jacques, was that aimed at me?"
"Yes, it's quite confusing how this restrictions will be aplied. We have flight on 28th from Warsaw with connection in doha. So quite stressed actually if we got any cases there in upcoming days and how we would be treated in that case in Vietnam"
"Ah Mrs 574, I can't find to whom I have answered, who questioned the accuracy of the information given here ! . I am so fed up with those endless discussions when so many messages show that the risk in Vietnam is quite infinitesimal, like a lot of people cannot READ!."
"It is extremely confusing. It doesn't make sense, they will lose all their Tourism if they ban countries that have small amounts of the virus. We are still okay here in South Africa, no reported cases this far, we are also traveling on Qatar Airways to Doha on the 13th of March. I asked this question to a guy from the Vietnam Tourism Board, this is his answer:. ""For now I can only confirm that it refers to the locations where there are large cases. I'll keep you updated if there are official announcements or clarifications."""
"Jacques, if it irritates you that much, stay out of any thread that involves the coronavirus! I understand that Vietnam is safe, I have not cancelled our trip for 2 weeks time but if there is even the slightest truth to the information that has been posted, I want to know as it will affect my plans. Scroll on..."
"Indeed. I'm not woried about virus, but after such news it gets very confusing wether we get in Vietnam or not. I don't want to lose my holiday time just to fly to Vietnam to got turned back. Pls let me know if you get reliable clarification on this."
"@Daumantas P. I'll let you know. I am sure you will be fine. Have a wonderful holiday!!!@jacquesb...I can see that you are extremely passionate about Vietnam, I havent even been, and I'm already passionate about the country. I have no doubts that they are doing everything they can to prevent further infections, they have done an amazing job already. I would go even if they had a 1000 cases. We are just concerned that we will not be allowed to enter Vietnam."
"@Daumantas P. I just saw this on vietnam-briefing.com, updated 2 hours ago. ""Vietnam’s Prime Minister has barred all travelers coming from areas that have experienced a COVID-19 outbreak. The policy includes travelers from South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran.""https:/…I think we are still okay to go!"
"We had the same questions over that recent article as it seemed to imply all countries where COVID-19 has been found. We are traveling from US through Dubai a week from tomorrow, and per Emirates they haven't had any reports of people coming from Dubai being denied entry into Vietnam. I'm more concerned about not being able to get into Vietnam, versus being able to return home, as it seems US is only banning foreign nationals from China at this point."
"If anyone is traveling to Vietnam but passing through Seoul, Korea in the coming days, please share your experience! @Skiier54321 - We share the same concerns. I'm not too concerned about returning home since the US is only banning foreign nationals from China. While the CDC gave South Korea a level 3, the state department has South Korea as level 2 along with Japan, Germany, etc. Also not too concerned about catching the coronavirus. What does concern me is being denied entry to Vietnam or quarantine."
"Such a confused situation. Next week we're travelling from Italy to Vietnam via Paris. I emailed this morning the Italian Emassy in Hanoi, and they said they didn't receive any communication about specific measures to limit the entry of people coming from Italy into Vietnam, however they reserve the right to adopt restrictive measures at the entrance towards travelers from areas at risk, including Italy, wtf.One month checking vietnam news, for a possible outbreak, now checking every day to be able entering in Vietnam."
"100% agreed, we aren't worried about not getting home, we're worried about being denied entry after flying across the world. We're in a bind as everything we booked is non-refundable. Unless Emirates cancels flights from Dubai to Hanoi, we're not able to try and convince the hotels / cruises to reconsider refunds. Hoping for more clarification in coming days!"
"Welp. i'm back on the thread. we tried cancelling hotels, cruise etc and pretty much everything is non refundable at this point."
"Talked with officer of Vietnam embassy in Poland. They said that restrictions are applied to hardly affected countries like Italy, Korea, etc. Countries with few cases are not under restrictions. For further info they advised to contact Vietnam immigration agency or so.."
"I agree 100%, as I am not worried about catching the disease as much as being restricted entry into Vietnam. Or possibly the worst case scenario of being quaranteed for 14 days how bad would that be!It's just not a good thing for everyone. South Korea is already over 1,100 cases and gaining rapidly. I really can't see being to be able to fly from there in the near future.I just hope the airlines, man up soon and take appropriate action regarding this situation and allow full refunds for flights to Southeast Asia.Edited: 11:30 am, February 26, 2020 "
@Anna C - Welcome back but so sorry to hear about your struggles!! I've been in contact with my hotel in Vietnam and all they did was offer a credit. I think at this point I'm going to let the situation decide for me. How long were you supposed to stay in Vietnam? The purpose of my Vietnam trip is for my honeymoon. We are supposed to arrive in HCMC then depart for Con Dao where we will be staying most of the time. Then head back to HCMC for a day and depart for the US. What are you going to do?
"Good luck with that, even after we had 3 flights with Cathay Pacific cancelled our main hotel refused to refund as it was non refundable. Contrast this with the Icelandic volcano disruption when we had 5 hotels agree to refund without any argument."
"MG, oh... Third world service. I booked Airbnbs. 10 of them, I just hope for a good American service if I have to cancel my trip. At this moment I plan to go. We fly through Taipei."
"@ready_spagetti @nomad7765 @sbc930 .... We are going to try and reschedule for one month from now(ish) with our same itinerary and accommodations ... April still works for us with our work schedules and it isn't rainy season yet... it's too much pressure right now to cancel or go next week with the S. Korea outbreak.. We are hoping that by April it will have calmed down... OR it will be much worse and hopefully we will have stronger case of getting our money back. If any of us are in Vietnam at the same time, we definitely need to meet for a drink or 5 after all of this haha"
"@ Anna C, please let us know how that works out for you. Personally I can't see this problem blowing over in a month's time. If it does not change you will be in the exact same boat as you are now.I just seen on the news that a U.S. airline are refunding in full all flights going to South Korea. Obviously that would be the way to go if you can get a full refund and then have the option of taking your vacation when things are all good again."

"@nomad7765 - we tried to cancel last night but we would be out a significant amount of money if we did. we are just trying to buy some time as our airline isn't offering a refund at this time... it's hard to say what will happen in a month... if it's better, we'll go.... if it's worse, hopefully we are in a better position to lobby for refunds etc with airlines and hotels. The only thing we know at this time is that we don't want to fly through S. Korea next week and try to re-enter US with that travel history with the way things are currently."
"@annaC @ready_spagetti @nomad7765 We've made the (gut-wrenching) decision to cancel our trip. Feeling absolutely heartbroken right now. We looked for other ways to get to Vietnam that wouldn't take us through South Korea, China, or Japan with no real luck (for flights that worked with our travel schedule). If there would have been any other way to get to Vietnam we would have felt perfectly safe being there and doing all the wonderful things we had planned (namely eating street food and wandering the streets for 3 weeks straight). But as the situation and the restrictions with South Korea have already changed so rapidly in the past couple of days we felt we needed to make this call. We are currently in the process of seeing where we will get refunds and what $ we'll be out. The 'how to cancel my vacation I've been planning for a year"" research is nowhere near as fun as the ""how many meals can I fit in in one day in Vietnam and where should I have them"" research."
Has anyone recently arrived into Vietnam after transiting through Japan? I'm scheduled to fly on Monday and my main flight takes me through Tokyo before arriving in Jakarta. I'm spending a few days in Indonesia before planning to enter Vietnam. Is this still going to be possible?
How is everyone going with canceling hotel reservations are hotels offering credits or refunds on non refundable bookings .... that’s really bad if they don’t Offer at least a credit for a later date
Also if your flights get cancelled is this covered under travel insurance/ even if your travel insurance does not cover epidemics or pandemics ... is this considered cancelled flights which you would be covered for
"Unfortunately they aren’t really cancelling flights, which makes it very hard to collect travel insurance. Mine has an exclusion for “your disinclination to travel during an epidemic or pandemic.” After asking I had two hotels and a cruise offer us a voucher for a future stay but the needed to be used by summer and I can’t get back until next year. I was so sure I was going over the weekend that I even changed one of our hotel reservations to nonrefundable because it had gone down in price and was so much cheaper. Things just changed too fast though. Delta was great and waived change fees though. So now headed to South America instead as they don’t seem to have nay outbreaks except the one guy in Brazil who was in Italy."
"We're lucky because most hotels we booked had free cancellation 3-7 days till checkin. Only Carlton hotel in Singapore we paid in advance and they are not answering our emails :(Lesson for future - never pay for hotel in advance, only book ones which allow free cancellation close to check in date.Singapoe Air is great though, allowed us to move flight dates to March 2021. Tickets were purchased using redemption points, maybe this is why they don't care?"
"ErnJaySydney, Australia, travel insurance never travel to asia with out medical alone , if they have to fly you home medical treatment will cost a fortune or same as if you are in the states must have travel insurance. Im flying out of sydney with a group in 3 weeks not worried about costs we all have travel insurance"
Can I please ask what company you booked your travel insurance with ? Would like to use them in the future ..... I booked mine with one cover before the coronavirus outbreak but still I’m not covered as they don’t cover epidemics or pandemics which is so Annoying wish I didn’t use this company
"I never travel without insurance, not sure why you think I do, seven222?Also, even if you've insurance I would be very careful to read fine print as it cases like Coronavirus you might not be covered anyway.."
"My trip is early April, flying via KL. I'm not cancelling. Airlines and UK government will decide for me. If the flight is still going, I trust it is safe enough for a healthy person with good hygiene precautions. This virus has been in the news for six weeks. A lot can happen in another six!"
"Most Australian insurance companies, do not cover for Pandemic or epidemic, check your fine print ring them and ask them to be sure."
Anyone any idea what happens if you are travelling with a cold? Are we likely to get turned away at HCM airport?
There have been cases in the uk do you think we will be ok? Flying to HCMC in two weeks
"No idea Sophie, I had to change my flight via HK as it got cancelled, thought I would be OK flying via Doha but now my wife has a cough and cold. Nothing major but with the understandable precautions being taken in Vietnam I’m concerned we might be held at the airport."
"Hello, I’m travelling in Vietnam right now and wanted to report back given that I was monitoring this thread before I travelled. I flew into Hanoi and I am travelling south as far as Hoi An (currently in Phong Nha after overnight train from Ninh Binh). There seems very little to be concerned about here. So far any impacts of the virus have only been positive in that queues are down! In Hanoi I was issued with a mask for some sights, and yesterday again at Trang An boat ride. From my experience but depending naturally on your health profile and when you are travelling (because the situation and stats continue to evolve) there’s absolutely no reason not to travel. The Vietnamese general population are wearing masks no more or less than usual, and official and tourist staff only if they have been instructed to in order to help you feel safe. In short, unless there is a specific reason for your not to travel, then do! I hope that helps because it was those on-the-ground reports that helped me decide."
"Is there an official website anywhere to check the current Vietnamese entry restrictions? Since Italians seem to be not allowed to enter Vietnam anymore, I as someone from Germany am really worried that in the coming days I will not be allowed to enter Vietnam anymore either. Our flight departs on March 3rd."
"I as someone from Germany am really worried that in the coming days I will not be allowed to enter Vietnam anymore either=================================Shouldn't you be asking your airline? No one knows the answers to these questions more than a day or 2 in advanceAt worst, you would remain on the plane and be flown back to your last point of boarding."
"Im flying out of sydney with a group in 3 weeks not worried about costs we all have travel insurance========================================I would be double checking that mateFrom a really big insurance company.We will not pay for claims caused by:1. an Act Of Terrorism (or arising directly or indirectly from it)or the threat, or perceived threat, of an Act Of Terrorism.2. an Epidemic, Pandemic or outbreak of an infectiousdisease or any derivative or mutation of such viruses (orarising directly or indirectly from these) or the threat, orperceived threat, of any of these."

I wouldn’t bank on the FCO advice against travel triggering Insurance cover either. I have an Admiral platinum cover annual policy and one of the specific exclusion for cancellation cover is “ for cancellation or cutting short your trip where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advised ‘against all travel’ or ‘against all but essential travel’ to the country or specific area you are travelling to”
Our flight with EVA airline JFK-Taipei-Hanoi was canceled.
"For when? Re: EVA flightEdited: 9:12 am, February 27, 2020 "
"MarinkaB,Did they contact you about that cancellation? Part of our party was supposed to be on that flight tonight but cancelled. They weren’t sure if they were doing the right thing or not. I can’t find anything about the cancellation on their website though."
"We arrived Hanoi 4 feb. 3 weeks in Vietnam. Now in koh rong Samleom for three nights, then Bangkok then home to Vancouver. Vietnam has the virus fully under control at this moment, as well as as Cambodia. This cant last however. We are worried about our return flights thru Seoul. In general, travel conditions have been fantastic! Crowds reduced, prices down. Has been a great trip so very glad we didn't cancel. Tomorrow is another day. Definitely getting scarier as time goes on. The quality of Our trip has not been compromised, but it will be better than usual feeling when we get back home.Edited: 9:24 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Not exactly third world service. I am booked w/ 5 star hotels throughout and all were willing to amend dates free of charge. Depends on the service provider and the quality of service you have booked. I am sure many smaller operators need the revenue from these bookings whereas larger more established ones can survive and thrive on the goodwill generated by their flexibility---they also have brands to protect. To confirm though, I have decided to go out so long as flights/entry between UK and Vietnam remains unaffected."
I also have annual Platinum Insurance cover with Admiral and it says you’re NOT covered if you CHOOSE TO TRAVEL to a country or area where the Foreign & Commonwealth Office have advised against “all travel” or “all but essential travel”. It doesn’t say FCO advice is a specific exclusion for cancellation cover.
"I think that you are looking under the general exclusions. Check under section 2: Cancelling or cutting short your trip. It is included under the exclusions. I have also had that confirmed to me over the phone.https:/…TR-APB-004-Travel-Policy-Book.pdfEdited: 11:47 am, February 27, 2020 "
So Admiral are saying that for Platinum Annual Multi Trip cover you’re not covered if you travel to somewhere the FCO advises against travelling to. But in the Guide they then say you’re not covered if holiday is cancelled due to FCO advice against travelling there ! I’ve booked holiday with a tour operator and so if they have to cancel it then apparently they are liable to give me a full refund OR offer alternative holiday.
"Yep, if you are through a tour operator it is their responsibility but if you’ve booked separate elements (like me) the insurer, in this case, won’t cover. Until the coronavirus outbreak it wasn’t anything I had considered when taking out insurance - lesson learnt, I’ll check more carefully in future. I wonder how many other policies are like that?"
Sadly you will not be alone ☹️
"@SBC930, why did you decide to cancel your trip? People are still flying from South Korea to Vietnam and I am sure that the airport is being kept very clean and germ free. We have the same flight on March 15 and if they decide to cancel the flight they will book me around it or give me an option of a full refund. You should go for it.@ Anna C, same thing why are you cancelling? Did you get a hold of Asiana to see if the flight is cancelled? If not why not take your trip?@ spaghetti, have you decided to go on your vacation?I personally believe that unless my country (CANADA) says they are banning flights to Southeast Asia that I am going. The chances of catching the virus are very rare. I will call the airline a day before to make sure the flights are all good and then will go and have a good time.Having said that the wife is leaning the other way so it is really up to the individual."
"Hi, if anyone has cancelled hotel reservations or tours that they will lose and cannot get reimbursed or get a credit for, I may be interested in buying them for a good price. It would be better than losing everything.Will be travelling Vietnam for a month starting on March 15, 2020."
"@nomad We have decided to just extend a month. We are leaving April 6 instead. The new Outbreak in S. Korea is just too logistically risky for us personally. We have flexible enough work schedules right now to postpone. Our airline (AirCanada) is offering a free re-booking without fare change. The U.S. is alarmed right now about the virus... We are more nervous than anything that we will get flagged on our way home. Not to talk politics here, but we don’t have the most faith in our government and how they will handle/react to this situation....... Hoping in a month everyone calms down. So far, all of our hotels and Halong Bay cruise have been accommodating on this as well.. If not, I’ll let you know if we have anything I can send your way ha."
My flight was canceled for next week - March 4. They moved our flight 24 hours later. BUT.... Did not give us the second leg of our journey. Flight Taipei-Hanoi was missed. IT TOOK soooo much of my working time. I was on a phone non stop. It is a mess. Really upset.
Not easy to call EVA airline. They just say that many calls are coming and do not put on a wait.
"people give over worrying there are  are far worse things that you can catch in vietnam  than the corona virus the people that have the virus have to be tested to  see whether they have it or not, it is that mild. the  people who do have the virus have that milder  symptoms, it is not a serous condition. the people  who have died from having the virus have been old  and have underlying medical conditions. Go to vietnam and enjoy"
"@ Anne C sounds good, I think that is a wise thing to do. We fly out on March 15. Will see in a week's time if it is escalating or not. Have safe travels!"
"With the new cases cropping up in California - where I reside - I'm now afraid Vietnam won't let me in more than I am afraid of catching COVID19. We are currently scheduled to depart March 20 via Taipei...I can only hope that things settle down.Edited: 7:02 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"SBC930, I am so sorry this has happened. I am scheduled to leave March 14, but who knows what will happen.Fiona, I appreciate your report, it helps a lot. Sounds like it will be great, if only we can get there!LikaKana82, I'm leaving from SFO through Taiwan, so I suppose we are in the same boat. Hoping for the best for all of us left in limbo."
"It's not going to get better it's now spread worldwide just about. I actually had an appointment with an infectious disease specialist Wednesday, he was 2 hours late because of this virus and he said not only is it highly contagious, but they really don't know if the 14 days incubation is enough. Australia has already taken action as if it's a Pandemic which it hasn't been declared yet by WHO..just a matter of time. Of course what you decide is your decision only ..and only you can make it, ..just don't be complacent, saying its nothing..."
"People should realise this is just a holiday and by travelling you increase the risk of spreading this virus around, doesn't matter if you're afraid or not.The speed of cases popping all around the world is worrying."
"@nomad7765 - I share the similar thoughts as you. Until my country (USA) implements a ban (South Korea, Vietnam) I'm still considering. For now I am a wait and see. However, today the US state department raised the security level for South Korea to 3 (out of 4), which is ""reconsider travel.."" I can't say with confidence this doesn't bother me slightly. South Korea was raised to level 2 earlier this week and in a matter of days it was raised to level 3. I already got the OK from work that if I needed to self-quarantine because of my trip, they would support it and I could work remotely (firm policy for transiting through South Korea). My travel plans in Vietnam is short and simple: HCMC, Con Dao (majority of the time), HCMC, then back home. I am able to get 100% refund on everything except my hotel in Con Dao, which is by far the most costly part of my trip + flights between HCMC and Con Dao. I'm ok with taking a hit for the internal flights but the hotel in Con Dao is a big hit.I depart for HCMC transiting through ICN (ugh!) from JFK on 3/13. Unless the situation makes a decision for me, I'm most likely going to pull the trigger end of next week. I'm in communication with my hotel in Con Dao regarding the situation. They're somewhat helpful. I mainly refer to these two sources:https:/…2020_02_TSA_detail.htmlhttps://www.vietnam.travel/things-to-do/info…I'm most concerned about quarantine, especially in a foreign country or back home in a military base. That would be my worst nightmare!!"
"Which quarantine ? NO MORE cases in Vietnam and the hospital, built early February (quick action from the Government !) as a security measure is empty. NO reason to worry here !"
"""NO reason to worry here !""There is if you're not allowed to enter the country.Or return to you home country without being quarantined.You keep missing the point, Jack.Scott"
"That's smart, as usual !! Of course, if you are not allowed to enter, Vietnam, you cannot enter it ! The question is : ""What about Vietnam and corona ?"" NOT ""Can I enter Vietnam if I am (nationality) ?"""
"""That's smart, as usual !!""Thank you, Jack, appreciate the compliment. But no, that was not the question.In fact, it wasn't even a question. Scott"
"Blinded by your silly need to harass me !!! ""What would you do in this situation? Would you still go or cancel the trip ? "". What are those if there are not questions ? You are becoming a real pain in the neck !!!!"
Hopefully niwa you get to visit Vietnam at a later date. I do believe you have done the best thing for you and your families peace of mind.
"I have been in touch with the Australian embassy in Vietnam. I have a flight booked in mid March Tokyo/Narita to Hanoi. They linked me to the following English language Vietnamese government website - www.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/English.Similar to the article posted earlier, the language is wishy washy but it seems as though the likelihood of being turned away at the border is increasing, even though the article linked only mentions Korea, it does mention ALL incoming travelers from COVID-19 affected areas at the beginning. This is all changing fast, and I, as many of you, will either have to make an agonizing decision or risk it. Unfortunately if a pandemic is declared you will see countries begin to close their borders entirely. My flight is not for about another 3 weeks. Anything could happen between now and then."
"An update for those interested, we are now in our second week traveling north to south Halong, Hanoi, Dong Hoi, Phongna, Hue and felt quite at ease with situation, we also spoken to quite a few fellow travellers on the way and have not heard of any bad experiences relating to the virus"
ErnJay #639That's exactly right.
"I live in the Netherlands, yesterday the first corona case has been reported in Tilburg.I happen to live in Tilburg :-( and my flight is scheduled for the end of March to Vietnam. I have not heard from my travel agency yet."
"COVID-19: CDC deletes Vietnam from list of 'destinations with risk of community spread'https:/…53215.htmlEdited: 7:06 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Kdejonge, why would you hear from your travel agent?I got mixed feelings with this coronavirus, nobody knows how many people die during the flu. For me personally it feels like mass hysterical who is feed by the media. Remember the Mexican Flu, in no time there was a so called vaccine which had terrible side effects."
"Been working on cancelling the details of our trip and saw this on the Asiana Airlines page for Coronavirus travel restrictions (this is the Vietnam restrictions): ""All passengers who visited China within the past 14 days from the arrival date are not permitted to enter Vietnam.Temporary discontinuation of visa-free entry of South Koreans to Vietnam (As of Feb 29, 2020) > In case of holding Vietnam Visa ① Passengers who have stayed or transfered via Daegu/Gyeongbuk are not allowed to enter Vietnam. ② From other regions : will be required to fulfill a 14-day quarantine period.※ Passengers departing from South Korea are required to be checked at the quarantine office and self-quarantined without exception"" https:/… Was trying to confirm and found this: …chinhphu.vn/Home/…38991.vgp ""All incoming travelers from South Korea or have travel record to South Korea shall be subjected to mandatory 14-day isolation, said the Committee.According to the Ministry of Transport, the number of flights between Viet Nam and South Korea has decreased significantly due to the reduction of passengers and most of the domestic airlines are considering temporary suspension of flights between the two countries.""So seems like we made the right call to cancel this week. Still bummed that we weren't able to find alternative flights to get us there and hate that we won't be able to reschedule the trip until next year. But I guess planning for that trip will be easy peasy since we've done all the leg work already."
And if it's helpful to anyone: because of the above info I was able to get a full refund on our flights (from Asiana through Travelocity).
"@SBC930 - Yea I saw that this morning. I'm planning on cancelling with KAL today since the decision has been made for me! I'm considering flying with EVA Air with a layover in Taipei, Taiwan to HCMC."
"@ready_spagetti yeah, we were looking at some other flights, but all the ones I found seemed to have 26+ hour layovers and we just didn't want to have our trip cut into so much on both ends. We are going to do a shorter trip somewhere closer to home (and somewhere warm) for now and then replan the trip for my work off-season (I work in the wedding industry so ramp up pretty hard in April through November). I'm thinking we'll probably go sometime in January/February next year. A long time to wait, but the planning will be easy the next time around because the leg work is already done. We may even make a longer trip out of it!"
"A key ?: given that the US is having problems with the CDC test kits, and as of today, few states even have working test kits (see NYT: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html?searchResultPosition=3), what's the testing and monitoring situation in VN? Are low rates due to lack of rigorous testing or capacity to test? I'm more worried about getting stuck in a ""quarantine trap"" if just one passenger or hotel guest is diagnosed; or stranded because a flight is canceled. They are shutting down public events and tour sites in other countries with more med resources than VN. Would love some perspective from someone who knows the medical capacity and testing situation in VN."
"@ SBC930, thanks for the great information regarding South Korea and entry into Vietnam.I just want to be absolutely sure on this. Is it true that if I have a transfer flight that takes me through ICN SEOUL INCHEON INT, KOREA REPUBLIC that I will be will be required to fulfill a 14-day quarantine period before being allowed into Vietnam! I was stubborn and still wanted to go on my dream vacation but with this news and the fact that I have a sinus problem it is a no-brainer. I will have to cancel for another time.Thanks again for the updated information.Much appreciated!!Safe Travels."
Well finally my flight from Seoul to Hanoi for Sunday on Delta/korean Airlines was officially cancelled. Maybe I can use the trip cancellation in my chase sapphire reserve now that it is officially cancelled. We will see.
"Air Canada as of now will not refund air tickets for flights to Vietnam which goes through Seoul, South Korea. Even though by going through South Korea I have to do a mandatory 14-day quarantine!What is up with that? Why Air Canada would take such a stand in these dire circumstances is beyond belief. You would think Air Canada would do the moral, right thing and issue full refunds. That speaks volumes where Air Canada would put its customers health and life at risk for money.Hope they change their policy soon and do the right thing!Obviously it is up to me to make the decision to the flight or not. But why should Air Canada make money from me under these worldly dire circumstances.Shame on you Air Canada!!"
"I was trying to make this trip work hell or high water- i am transiting through Seoul as well- but as off today this is listed on the Korean Air website in the restrictions by country. ""- Anyone who departs from or is transiting through South Korea will be quarantined in Vietnam for 14 days after arrival. (as of Feb 28)"". Yikes and no thank you."
"I'm not going to lie, I am not worried about the virus. However, we are supposed to leave March 7 from the US and have already changed our layover to be in NRT instead of ICN. However, the last thing I want is to be quarantined in Vietnam for 2 weeks. I didn't plan a huge vacation to sit in a room for 2 weeks. the more Vietnam is quaranting people, the more I am thinking about canceling. All of our hotels are non-refundable, but I think at this point I could get the money for our flights back. I'm very conflicted."
"Endless replies of “its safe in Vietnam, no problems here” or more people get killed by the flu” (a stupid comparison btw) really are missing the point.Nobody here seems worried about catching the virus in Vietnam. Most people here are concerned with their travel arrangements, getting stranded out there or quarantined either in Vietnam or when they return home, because their flight is routed through a high risk area. This isn’t unreasonable or stupid given the flight restrictions being put in place and changing daily. My personal concern at the moment is being prevented entry at the airport due to having a cold - the Vietnamese embassy in London have told me that is likely to happen."
"MGThe mass panic on multiple TA forums has only recently changed in the last week or so, from will I die if I travel to will I be quarantined if I travelI've just returned home from a 7 week trip to SE Asia, and looking to head back out to Thailand in May for a few weeks, assuming the situation doesn't take a drastic turn for the worse. As it is now, perfectly happy to travel"
"Here's my situation, I am traveling from Orlando to New York to Seoul to Ho Chi Minh airport where we will do a tour through cambodia and then thailand. I just concerned about flight delays, I already have a 15 hour layover in new york due koren airlines flight cancellations, initially it was just a 4 hour layover now its 15 hours, i am hoping they don't extend the layovers, we are going in mid april so we still have some time and I'm hoping they dont do that. Like many of you, I am all set, flights, tours, extra activities, etc so we will have to see what happens. are they cancelling all korean air flights? no right? just a few have been cancelled, kinda glad to hear im not the only one in this predicament"
Where does it say that people coming from South Korea will be quarantined for 14 days :(
"No-brainer, why would I go on an Air Canada flight that goes through South Korea where I have no choice but to do a mandatory 14 - day quarantine before arriving into Vietnam?The big question is why would Air Canada knowing this, not allow me a full refund? Do they literally want me to go through all this so that they could keep my money?Why would Air Canada put it customers in such turmoil? I hope Air Canada addresses this serious issue very soon!!In the mean time, SHAME ON YOU AIR CANADA!!"
"I am now seeing on the korean air website they cancelled all flights to ho chi minh and all these cities in NE asia , ncheon - Ulaanbaatar, Incheon - Wuhan, Incheon - Zhangjiajie, Incheon - Changsha, Incheon - Kunming, Incheon - Qingdao, Busan - Beijing, Busan - Nanjing, Incheon - Huangshan, Jeju - Beijing, Incheon - Beijing, Gimpo - Beijing, Incheon - Shanghai/Pudong, Incheon - Shenzhen, Incheon - Shenyang, Incheon - Hefei, Incheon - Hangzhou, Incheon - Nanjing, Incheon - Xiamen, Incheon - Jinan, Incheon - Tianjin, Incheon - Weihai, Incheon - Xi'an, Incheon - Zhengzhou, Busan - Shanghai/Pudong, Busan - Qingdao, Busan - Taipei, Incheon - Hong Kong, Incheon - Taipei, Incheon - Dalian, Incheon - Yanji, Incheon - Guangzhou, Incheon - Mudanjiang, Busan - Narita, Busan - Nagoya, Busan - Fukuoka, Incheon - Okinawa, Incheon - Aomori, Incheon - Niigata, Incheon - Komatsu, Incheon - Kagoshima, Incheon - Okayama, Gimpo - Haneda, Gimpo - Osaka, Incheon - Osaka, Incheon - Fukuoka, Incheon - Nagoya, Incheon - Sapporo"
"Nomad7765 you can at least claim your taxes. This is almost never explained to passengers but it is your right, since you won’t be flying. This should happen automatically in y opinion but unfortunately it’s not the case so you have to fill up a form and after a few months you will get a few hundred Dollars back."
I’ve got a very bad cold at the moment & hoping it clears completely before fly out next Sat 7 March. It did occur to me the possibility of being prevented entry if still have it !It’s not fear of the virus it’s the worry re logistics / flight cancellations / quarantining even if just transited through an affected area ☹️
"@nomad7765 YEP. This is exactly why we ""extended"" to buy some time... hoping that they come to their senses... we obviously aren't traveling next week even if we wanted to, and they tried to penalize us... just hoping for them to catch up with the news and cancel these flights and refund us.."
"We also fly out from the UK on March 7th to Hanoi for a 3 week organised tour of Vietnam and Cambodia. For weeks I have been monitoring the situation and relieved that instances in both countries remained low, since the outbreaks in Korea and Italy I am now concerned about entry into Vietnam if things escalate in the UK in the next week. I would hope that if there is a likelihood of problems arriving on Vietnam that our travel company will cancel the holiday .Worst case is that the UK status changes while we are travelling out."
"@sbc930 Was your entire itinerary through Asiana? We have a leg serviced by them, but yet Air Canada still wont refund us... it makes zero sense"
"@LolaMunich: Thanks for the idea. Would you know where I can find the form to claim a refund for the taxes on flights I didn't take (IAD to Vietnam thru NRT) with ANA? I couldn't cancel since it's nonrefundable ticket, and bought through FLIGHTHUB online so since it's from a 3rd party, ANA wouldn't talk to me, and said I need to talk to Flighthub which is hopeless."
"@LetsTravelWithAdrian i have copied and pasted from this linkhttps:/…2020_02_TSA_detail.html""- Anyone who departs from or is transiting through South Korea will be quarantined in Vietnam for 14 days after arrival. (as of Feb 28)""However i am not seeing this anywhere on the web- waiting for my airline to call me w clarification."
"Asiana Airlines says""※ Passengers departing from South Korea are required to be checked at the quarantine office and self-quarantined without exception""https:/…"
"@ Madeleine MT, I would strongly advice you to call Flighthub and see what the airline's policy is of now for cancelling your flightI called Expedia which explained as of now Air Canada has not cancelled the flight even though if I do fly with their route I will be quarantined for 14 days!She basically said wait and see if things change. BUT when I questioned If I were to cancel the flight today what would be the charge, she said Air Canada would charge us $200 on each ticket.So at least it is not a total lost! Having said that Air Canada should not be making money on us because of a natural disaster!!Time to wake up Air Canada and do the right moral thing!!P.S. I will wait to see if Air Canada comes to their senses. Surely they cannot expect me to be quarantined for 14 days!"
"@nomad7765 - Shame on Air Canada. That's insane and doesn't make sense. Why would they want their customers to be subjected to a 14 day quarantine?! Hopefully they come to their senses and do the right thing or at least look at what their competitors are doing! I cancelled with KAL via Delta this morning with no issues. I just rebooked my flights (NY to SGN) with Eva Air where I will have a layover in Taipei, Taiwan. But before booking I spoke with Eva Air regarding their cancellation policy. They said if I choose to cancel I will have to pay a $300 cancellation fee. But if governments place restrictions due to the coronavirus such as quarantine and bans, they will waive the cancellation fee and give me a 100% refund. I actually called the Vietnam Consulate in NY today to see if they can clarify some of the media reporting that's confusing. The gentleman I spoke to said I should have no issues traveling to Vietnam as a US citizen passing through Taiwan. He said there are only restrictions from mainland China and the two regions in Korea (Daegu and I forgot the other one). However he did not mention anything about quarantine passing through South Korea. I plan on going to the consulate some time next week to apply for a visa in person and use that opportunity to ask questions.Will share my experience with the consulate!I'm hoping from now until 3/13 all I have to think about is what I'm going to do in Vietnam! If all goes well, I'm happy to share my experience while I'm abroad.Edited: 3:34 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"@ spaghetti, oh so you got a full refund ? That is great! Did you have to change your visa to get in? I found the evisa to be the best way for Vietnam.Anyway safe travels and have a great vacation!!"
"Madeleine, It’s a bit more complicated since you didn’t buy the ticket with ANA directly,I think you do have to contact flighthub. You could also try emailing Ana customer care. That is what I did when I was in the same situation. I had to cancel a non - refundable flight to Vancouver last year, in my case it was easier since I had bought it on the Air Canada website and I was able to claim the tax refund directly with them, but I did not find the form anywhere on the website so I emailed their customer service and they sent me a link. But I tell you: don’t expect much! I think we got about 200€ per ticket, we are a family of 5 so we were happy to get the 1000€ back!"
"Traveling with connections is becoming a lottery.I would only fly direct for at least another month.Edited: 6:14 am, February 29, 2020 "
"I have basically booked everything ( hotels, flights, train etc) and I was about to apply for the online visa when the virus started spreading. We decided to wait and apply for a Visa only 7-8 working days before our planned departure ( beginning of April) in the hope that they will either deny the visa, sparing us having to fly to Hanoi for being put on the first flight back to Europe or, if they do approve it, it’s a sign they will likely let us in. I don’t know if it makes sense but why would they approve our visa so short before departure if they already know we won’t be welcomed in the country? I hold an Italian passport, but I haven’t been in Italy in months. My husband and kids all have a german passport but the virus is spreading in Germany too, so who knows how it will be in a month from now!"
I think that they will sell visa to everyone that applies for it. On the application form they don't ask where you board the plane. So it would have to be denied based on nationality. But even then... I think they still will sell it to you. Business is business.
"Actually when I applied for the visa last month they asked me for my flight itinerary and advised me that my entry would be denied if had been to China. Yesterday I asked again how was the situation on the border and what are the current travel restrictions and they also advised me abou the quarantine for people coming from South Korea.I’m flying from Brazil to HCMC on March 19 through London and Bangkok and I’m monitoring the situation, but not thinking about cancelling right now.Now I’m mostly concerned about the formula 1 GP since this is the main reason for my trip..."
"Thank you LolaMunich. Will do! I have my next trip to Italy bought from Gate1 travel now to deal with too. Flying to Milan for the Tuscany fly and drive package for March. If you or anybody knows on a way I can cancel and get something back, I would appreciate your advice."
"They will sell NO visa to anybody of a banned nationality, such a Chinese, South Korean or Italian. Don't mix Vietnam with Cambodia or Laos !"
"We booked our visa about 8 days ago through this sitehttps:/…trang-chu-ttdtNowhere does it ask from which country you are flying from. So I guess you can fill it in an get a visa.They say on their site that they stop issuing e-Visa for foreigners who are in or have recently visited areas where Covid-19 is spreading. So if you recently have been in China or Korea... bad luck (I wonder how they can check it. When I arrived at Da Nang 4 days ago, nobody checked my stamps in my passport)Also, that doesn't mean there will be flights going to Vietnam from the country you want to fly from. Flights from most Chinese cities are cancelled anyway.People mix things up. Travellers from Korea for example will not be put in quarantaine. They simply will not allow planes from Korea (or certain cities in Korea) to land in Vietnam. The quarantaine is for Vietnam citizens who want to return from Korea to Vietnam."
"We will be leaving on Tuesday from Germany from Frankfurt with Vietnam Airlines to Hanoi. The most recent news from our airline states that everyone taking flights from Italy or Iran will have to be isolated for 14 days before being granted entry. In Germany corona cases are rising dramatically since Tuesday. Even though Germany is not on the list yet, we worry which affects it would have on us if this changed and we were in Vietnam already. Could we be isolated if we took domestic flights without problems?We really dont know what to do :/Edited: 3:08 am, March 01, 2020 "
"If you have a direct fly from Germany it will be ok.In case Germany will get worse like Italy now you can always go back to your country, assuming there is a flight..."
"So you think there will not be any restrictions once you have entered the country, even though the country you were in a few days ago is now on the list?"
"@nomad7765 - Hope you were able to get a refund without having to pay the cancellation fee. I read an article yesterday about an Asiana flight bound for Hanoi from Incheon that turned back around because of the new screening/quarantine restrictions set in place. https:/…AEN20200229002900320Yea I was able to get a full refund most likely because I booked directly with Delta and not KAL. I know a few people were struggling to get refunds if they booked directly with KAL. Hopefully with new flights, all go as planned but you just never know!"
"We have also ticket to Vietnam from Frankfurt but in 3 weeks from now. I don't know what will happen until then,but if they ban Germany i hope they will do that earlier and we hope we could get full refund. 30000tage can you inform us what is going on there since you go in Tuesday? I hope everything will be good."
"@ spaghetti, I am not sure what is going on anymore as I am more confused now than ever about the flights from Korea to Hanoi. I do know as of now Air Canada has not rerouted or cancelled my flight which flies into South Korea.I will try to call Asiana Airlines tomorrow to see if my flight is cancelled. I did see that they are cancelling flights to Hanoi but it is too early to check mine on March 15.The whole thing does not look good and it seems I will have to cancel my 2-month trip. I hope Air Canada comes through and issues a full refund!"
the fact that you are fit and healthy is very good but the point is that you could get the virus and pass it on to someone who is not fit and healthy and they could die
"News from the US Embassy in VietnamHealth Alert – U.S. Embassy Hanoi, Vietnam (February 29, 2020)Event: Effective immediately, the Government of Vietnam has directed passengers on all inbound flights from South Korea, Italy, and Iran, as well as those who have transited through these countries in the last 14 days, to be subject to intensive screening upon arrival.

Does anyone know if there is a English version of this site? https://ncov.moh.gov.vn Paranoid after reading the last post that we will get refused entry or quarantined.
As long as you are flying direct from Australia I can’t see an issue. We fly out 14/03 direct to Hanoi.
"Can you please keep us updated , I’m very interested in seeing how Australians are going getting through quarantine etc We leave on 27/3"

"Newspaper Courrier du Vietnam of 28 February (my translation) :The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) has decided to remove Vietnam from its list of countries presenting a risk, saluting the efficient fight of the country against the epidemic of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)."
Just got a confirmation from Asiana that all flights from Seoul to Hanoi are cancelled for this month. Phoned Expedia and got a full refund on my airline tickets!I am happy with that as I have ongoing sinus problems and it would not be a good thing travelling South East Asia at this time.Wish everyone all the best. Vietnam will have to wait for another year.Safe travels!
"digidaydreams. France and Germany have about 4 times the corona incidents as us in the UK at around 200 each. I'm due to fly out on Saturday arriving Hanoi on Sunday, so I will be keeping an eye on when Vietnam refuse entry from additional countries, hopefully it's not while I'm in the air flying out!!"

"Jacques b- as a medical professional in the US I have to say my confidence in the CDC on this particular subject is fading. The US has been woefully ill prepared for a variety of reasons but largely because our administration has not made it a priority. I just got off the phone with the airlines and canceled our upcoming trip to Vietnam (sniff sniff) but not so much because of anything in Vietnam, but because of uncertainty here and worry that my parents or others may fall ill while we are away among other reasons. Just not sure the CDC has earned a gold star (yet) on this outbreak, but maybe they can redeem themselves..."

"I'm not sure what the advantage of a single mega thread is. There are over 700 replies on this one, so nobody can be expected to read them all and a lot of them are out of date anyway, so people asking for up to date information isn't unreasonable. What is unreasonable is people expecting answers to impossible questions (Will it be safe to travel to Vietnam next month?) or questions where they have to make their own mind up (Should I go to Vietnam?) but people have been asking unanswerable questions for years.Another problem is that I don't think there is a 'community' view on many things anyway,If people don't like new threads on the subject, they can just ignore them rather than sniping at the poster. That would already remove a lot of the noise."

HiWe are booked to visit Vietnam in 2 weeks ( Early March ) we land in Hanoi than onto Sapa before going to Nha Trang and HCM do you think its still safe to visit regarding the Corona Virus? We are seniors!!Hard to keep away from crowds in these cities!! Normally we don't have concerns but this is getting big and at our age we have to be a tad concerned!!Thank you
"The single advantage of a mega-thread, when we agree to it, is ten-fold benificial.First off, we don't have to biatch about new threads.Secondly, we can quarantine new threads, which also makes a lot of sense.Thirdly, we don't spread panic, which might be worse than Covid-19 itself.Fourthly, people can learn that in time like this, you need to self-quarantine your fear and concern.Fifthly, people may come to realize that it's not about ""just"" them.Sixthly, and so on and so forth........People need to realize that it's best to get the most relevant update in one thread rather than reading countless of ""fly-by-night"" new threads.As I had said, if a new thread is warranted, we're knowledgeable enough to start one.Sincerely,John"
"I'm not sure I see the advantage at all really.> First off, we don't have to biatch about new threads.Nobody has to do that anyway. The 'biatchers' are already part of the problem. But how is it going to work? Somebody posts a new question. They tick 'Get notified by e-mail when a reply is posted"". They see a reply saying that their question has been moved to the mega thread. They don't get any more email updates and if they want to see answers to their question, they need to dig through the mega thread where there are now multiple interleaved questions and answers. And just because someone asked the same question last week, doesn't mean that this weeks answer would still be the same, so much of the wisdom in the mega thread is perhaps out of date.Compare that to: Somebody posts a new question. They tick 'Get notified by e-mail when a reply is posted"". People who don't like their thread just ignore it. The poster get replies and email notifications as normal and can engage in a thread dedicated to their particular question and have answers relevant (and hopefully useful) at that time. Given that the people posting new threads aren't generally regular posters, I just think that by making it more complicated it will become less helpful.This plague of virus questions won't last forever."

"Dr. Mike, here; travel to VN is ok; however, I would caution you about traveling through South Korea. If possible, arrange for a flight that does not require you to, physically, disembark and spend any extended time, even in the airport in South Korea which may expose you to more risk. However, Vietnam is Ok, providing that you would continue taking as much caution as you would in traveling to most other areas of the world, eg., N95 mask, sanitizing most public surfaces before direct contact, avoiding close proximity (as much as possible) to others, especially coughs, sneezes, etc."

"I will as well. Much as I want to go and can’t bear not to see my son, I am wishing the FO would do an advisory not to travel so I know what I am doing . I can’t afford to lose out on flights/prepaid stuff. Day by day."
"This thread has been so helpful, Thank you all for all the updates and info. We are due to travel to Vietnam for a once in a lifetime trip on this Friday the 13th!! from Heathrow.We have booked to do one night Hanoi, one night Halong bay then 3 nights Hoi an and 1 week on Phu Quoc.Given the present situation we are thinking to cancel the Hanoi and Halong bay part and either go from Hanoi airport direct to Hoi an and on to Phu quoc or even straight to HCMC and Phu Quoc to avoid all the extra flights(obviously at an extra cost), but unfortunately that would mean us missing out majority of initial plan. If the foreign office decided to advise against travel then we would cancel, as getting really anxious about the trip and having to be quarantined for 2 weeks. I know no one can really advise but do any of you good people please have any thoughts on our itinery change?Thanks in advance"
"But are you guys sure your airline doesn’t at least offer you to change the dates? I fly Aeroflot and they give me no cancellation refund, but I am able to change the dates against a 30€ fee within the one year ticket validity ( and the fee is unexpectedly low! )I thought I had a non- changeable ticket and I haven’t fully understood if they allow me to change because of the Coronavirus situation or not, but since I thought I would loose all the money I am obviously very happy with this solution."
"Just spent 3 days in Hanoi, 2 in mai Chau, 1 in Ninh Binh and 3 glorious days in Hoi An. Now, waiting at the airport to head to Siem reap. Can’t advise you on what to do but we are so glad we decided to travel"
"Hello all,We are planning to travel to Cambodia on 25th March then onto Vietnam on 1st April for our honeymoon. I’ve just had an update from the FCO that Vietnam is considering suspending the 15-day visa waiver, which we were planning on using, and may do so at short notice.The advice appears quite confusing at the moment, we still want to travel as everything is paid for and cancelling would mean loosing all of our money and forgoing a honeymoon. Does anyone know whether UK citizens are being denied entry? Or whether we should apply for an Evisa and travel as planned?"
"On the Vietnam embassy site it says the 15 day visa waiver is cancelled for all countries where the virus is spreading,vietnamembassy.org.uk/index.php…Edited: 5:35 am, March 09, 2020 "
Ive just read that again and it actually says“ Vietnam also temporarily stops issuing e-Visa for foreigners who are in or have recently visited areas where Covid-19 is spreading.”I’m concerned now as I’m going on the 30th
"Latest from UK Foreign Office:https:/…health""On 8 March, the Vietnamese Government announced plans to suspend the visa waiver programme for UK and other European nationals. This change could be implemented at very short notice. British citizens planning to enter Vietnam on the visa waiver programme should check before travelling."""
"I had a trip planned for the 18th April. I was entering via Ho Chi Minh with a visa waiver, travelling to Cambodia next day and coming back to Da Nang 3 days later with a visa which I already have confirmed. What are my options now?"
> This change could be implemented at very short notice. Short notice indeed.…chinhphu.vn/Home/…39094.vgpDoesn't say if we get two days before it's enforced like the Italians did. Nothing on the UK embassy site yet.
This morning the Vietnamese embassy have informed me that you need to obtain a visa to enter Vietnam and can do so via their website (including a next day express service)
"I feel very uncertain about it all.We're in the UK & it's clear they've removed the visa exemption.I think e-visa is no longer an option as the UK is now an area where C19 is spreading.I've just got letters of approval to get Visa on Arrival. I hope that is still available.Edited: 6:31 am, March 09, 2020 "
Just received this from my hotel in Tam Coc. I had already cancelled my trip but received it anyway. Thought it might be of interest to others who still are deciding. Warmest Greetings from Tam Coc Horizon Bungalowwe are very sad to inform that this morning the police announced they found a case of covid 19. They will blockdown the entire area of ​​Tam coc in this afternoon. so we cannot welcome you at our hotel during this period. We will contact to booking.com for free cancellationWe wish we could have the chance to welcome you next time

Any restrictions in Hoi An? I'm planning to travel there next week.
"Mark T, I left Hoi An yesterday morning.The previous days was extremely quiet.7th March was the full moon/lantern festival and there was only a Max of 10 lantern boats out on the river. The following night, I saw one boat at any one time, around dinner time.A few stores are closed. Maybe because it was Sunday? In general, it's super quiet. Hotel staff and shop staff said that they're getting about 40% of the normal amount of visitors as most of their visitors are Chinese and Korean groups.Everyone is cautious and taking preventative measures but I haven't seen restrictions as such.In my Da Nang hotel this morning, breakfast buffet is no longer running. They only have a la carte. I assume this is for hygiene reasons. The staff didn't understand my question when I asked."
Thanks for the info!

"I just came back from a 1 week trip in Hanoi, Ha Long, SaPa, and Ninh Binh. I had a blast! However, on our last day, somebody got diagnosed with covid in hanoi. Some shops and hotels have closed. We actually had to book another hotel across the street. I am now here in Manila and the cases here are increasing as well. I guess, nowhere is safe to go now.

Due to the change of circumstances, the Embassy of Vietnam in London could not process visa application submitted in the 9th of March and will make full refund for the applicants by post.For those who wish to travel to Vietnam, they need to contact with their Vietnamese sponsors/tour-operators for arrangement of their visas with the Immigration Department of Vietnam. Having got the visa approval letter from the Immigration Department, they can contact Vietnam Embassy for the issuance of entry visas to Vietnam.Regards,Member of staffUpcoming holidays"
Did you end up traveling to Vietnam? I have an upcoming flight to Saigon with a lay over at Beijing China. Not sure if I should cancel.
hi! can you hook us ip with your tour operator? We'll be in vietnam 5th of april. my bf holds French passport but is in UK now.
"Yes, I agree. We felt we had to cancel because of all the uncertainty. If we can't see the main tourist sites and have to fear being quarantined, what's the point? It takes away the fun and spontaneity of travel. Best of luck."
"My boyfriend got a similar reply from the embassy. When it says tour operator, we aren’t doing an organised tour but staying in various hotels and doing a cruise in halong bay. Shall we contact the hotels instead to arrange the visa? We are going on Friday and this whole thing has messed everything up - they didn’t even notify us we needed visas, it was only when we looked at forums like this and the news"
"We’re likely postponing our trip but I see they have updated the travel website to say “ Countries with more than 500 confirmed cases of COVID-19, or more than 50 new cases per day, can also expect to have visa exemptions to Vietnam suspended at this time. Vietnam may refuse to grant visas to travellers showing symptoms of COVID-19”. I am from the USA which doesn’t have a visa exemption anyway but now US has over 500 cases so it’s a bit vague if the e-visa I already have (grantedbefore this all started) would be denied or only if we exhibit symptoms of covid19 on arrival. https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/informat…"
"> Shall we contact the hotels instead to arrange the visa?You can try, but I doubt if it will work, There are hundreds of visa agents so it wouldn't make any sense for the embassy to say you can just get a visa letter from any of them and we'll give you a visa. They say Sponsor/Tour Company and I think that's what they mean. Book a tour with a licensed tour company - they give you the letter - the consulate gives you a visa. Wouldn't make any sense to tighten up and carry on as before. But ask anyway."
"Update from Hanoi..Yesterday, the Temple of Jade Mountain on Hoan Kiem Lake was closed due to COVID.My Halong Bay cruise booked for tomorrow to Bai Tu Long Island has been cancelled as Halong Bay is closed from 12 March to 27 March due to increasing risk of COVID.I will be trying to go to Ninh Binh (Trang An) tomorrow. Hopefully they will still allow travellers in."
We are supposed to be flying to Danang this coming Friday via Doha. and stating in Hoi An. I applied for our on line visa's yesterday and paid. My partner has said he has seen that people are being allowed in to Danang and as they get to the hotel or shortly after they are being collected by armed guards and quarantined. Surely we cant be expected to go?? :(

ill check and post my worst fear is arriving in Danang this coming Saturday and being quarantined. I spoke to Qatar airways yesterday and they said our flight was going ahead on fri night.Im doubting i'll get our evisa's now considering the waiver rule changed only yesterday although I did apply and pay the moment I saw waiver had been suspended. I did email them first thing this morning but my guess if they dont want us there they will just ignore it?

"Well the situation seems to be deteriorating rapidly, Closing Da Nang, Halong, Cat Ba, Tam Coc... Altogether with the visa situation, I guess there is no point on actually trying to get to Vietnam anymore."
"Any actual proof that Danang is ""closing"", surely they won't close a whole city?"
"Yeah, I wish that people like Alberto stops throwing out bkanket statements like that.I have yet to hear about any quarantine in Da Nang; just self-isolation for a number of people that were in close contact with certain cases.This news media is a goverment-sanctioned outlet, in Vietnamese, with some 5 new stories regarding the situation in Da Nang, and there's nothing of the sort.https://nld.com.vn/suc-khoe/da-nang-cach-ly-…Please use a webpage translator like Itools to get some idea.Regards,John"
Does anyone know about Vietnam Airlines policy is on refunds. We are meant to fly from London early April and trying to plan ahead but struggling to get much advice from booking agent/airline.
IAlberto’s comments are not helpful and are based on ignorance of the facts. I don’t know if he has even been to Vietnam. The actual current situation in Hoi An is that until today everything was open and normal but quieter due to the absence of Chinese and Korean visitors.. there has been a report of a European case of the virus and quite a few restaurants and shops have shut. The Vietnamese seem more wary and afraid of the virus than the Europeans.
There are some info on Vietnam Airlines site regarding refunds if you're coming from certain areas but some info are still a bit confusing. I have submitted a request online with them for a refund on my tickets.
"Sorry, confused Da Nang with Hoi An. But happy to be proven wrong on what I have said. You have plenty of evidence on this same forum:Hoi An: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g298…Halong: https:/…halong-bay-closure-covid-19Cat Ba:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g737051-i14110-k13260871-Cat_Ba_closed_to_all_foreigners_7_March-Cat_Ba.htmlTam Coc: You can read about hotels closing a few pages back in this same thread.Con Dao: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g102…Visa situation: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…Again, please explain where I am mistaken and an ignorant. Obviously the situation is deteriorating and they are closing tourist areas. That's a fact. I am the first one concerned as I have a full 2 weeks trip booked in April and I now facing a total cancellation with no refunds."
"All across the country, many hotels, restaurants, shops, and even vendors at local market are closed simply due to lack of patronage.Some can't afford to pay their rent; others can't pay their employees.Lots of fruit went rotten because the people can't export them (buyers from other countries had suspended their buys.Just a bad situation all around.I imagine the same thing is going on in many countries around the world, too.John"
"Hi Sweethi - can you post links please? I can't find anything on the Vietnam Airlines website about refunds / changes if coming from Europe, only South Korea. Otherwise it's their £150 fee per ticket!"
We had a five hour schedule change on our planned return flight - very lucky as this entitles us to a full no fee refund . Worth a thought if you had one and want to cancel .
"Yes, but some shop and hotel closings are totally different than a lock-down.The boat ride at Tràng An is still operating.And people can still travel to see different things and visit other places/townsJohn"

"My husband and I are supposed to be flying from London Heathrow to Hanoi on 9 April 2020. We had originally been planning to use the British exemption for visas (and therefore had not arranged one), when this got cancelled, we tried to book an e-visa last night, but it no longer seems possible to get a visa.I have tried calling the Vietnamese Embassy multiple times today, but there is no dial-tone. Is anyone else experiencing something similar? Does anyone have any suggestions of how we can get a visa? As it currently stands, we would still be happy to travel, if we can get the relevant paperwork in place enabling us to do so!"
The only way it’s possible to get a visa is if youbooked your trip via a tour operator who should sort the letter of the visa to be done.

"We booked in December when there was no need for a visa, also went to Danang last year and no visa was needed as less than 15 days. We fly this coming Friday to Danang and found out yesterday visa waiver was suspended as per our gov website we applied for an evisa yesterday and paid. Now today they are not processing any visas what should we do? We are in early 40's healthy and have a hotel booked in Hoi An from this saturday coming? Im so upset and confused!!"
"> Now today they are not processing any visas what should we do?Only way apparently is to sign up with a tour company in Vietnam, get a letter from them then get a visa from the Consulate in London.No Visa = No fly. :-("
We're worried we get to Danang and are quarantined unnecessarily have you heard of that? We due to arrive in Danang this coming Saturday 14th.
How would i do that? I booked the holiday through Ebookers can they help? This has all happened so quickly im not sure what we are expected to do?
"They're gearing uphttps://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-pr…Vietnam has show that they will do whatever it takes to contain this. Given their system of government, they don't need to worry unduly about public opinion, human rights or what any of us might think.Numbers are beginning to climb in Vietnam, so anything is possible.I suspect they'll soon cut off flights from places like the UK to just have one less thing to worry about."
"> I booked the holiday through Ebookers can they help?Ask them ASAP. Nobody else can help you.Get a letter from the tour company in Vietnam tomorrow, get an overnight visa from the consulate in London, fly on Saturday. But it's a stretch."
"""This has all happened so quickly im not sure what we are expected to do?""It has.You need to try and get a visa, but I fear that that will not be possible.It seems the VOA (visa on arrival) agents are no longer offering their service to UK passport holders, and I don't believe an e-visa is now an option to you guys, either.It has been mentioned, as Manat said, that a tour company may be able to help you.I'm not sure that that is an option anymore.SorryScott"
Ok this all sucks big time but not sure what you mean by a tour operator in vietnam? Can you help and explain? Unless like someone said they shut the doors completely we are severely out of pocket just for booking a holiday 3 months in advance and rules being changed last minute through no fault of ours!! :( I will try Ebookers too. Thanks everyone.
I have my E-Visa but on a british passport but haven’t lived there for 2 years and coming from NZ - not sure they will care where I am travelling from more that I am on a british passport? Not sure what to do...was going to print of my NZ visa and show bank statements etc but again I think it will come down to my passport!! Very confused
"> but not sure what you mean by a tour operator in vietnam? Can you help and explain?Well the UK company you booked with will have either a subsidiary in Vietnam or more likely just have booked you with a Vietnamese tourist company (Công ty Du Lịch). You need a visa letter from that company showing that you are booked on a tour. With that letter you can get a visa in London. According to the consulate on London, that's the only way to get a visa."
> I have my E-Visa but on a british passportAs far as I know already granted E-Visas are still being accepted.That might change of course.
I really couldn't find a proper answear to this question. Please don't kill me if there is answear somewhere in the forums. I do have a visa approval letter issued 13.02.2020. It says its valid and it allows me to pick up visa upon arrival in Ho Chi Minh City.

Thank you both for your quick answears. It helped greatly. We are both before our thirties and healthy with no issues whatsoever so I suppose health check would not be a problem. I guess I'll keep a close eye on the situation regarding visas and quarantines ( which also make me nervous a little bit - are they gonna quarantine all foreigners coming to Vietnam?).

"I can't remember if I posted this here or on the USA thread but this is slightly different wording that I saw earlier today:""Vietnam has also indicated visas will be suspended for nations reporting 500 cases or more of COVID-19, or those with more than 50 new cases per day.""https:/…covid-19-travel-policies-vietnam"

"@manatdollar yes, that’s what I mean. It would also include the US as we don’t have exemptions either."
"> It would also include the US as we don’t have exemptions either.If you mean its not relevant to the US at all since US citizens don't get visa waivers, then I agree."
"Well the tourism site I linked uses different wording than what you posted which would make it applicable to the US if true. That’s my actual original point. I found the information in 2 places and one uses the wording “visa exemptions” that you quoted and the other just says “visas”. So, it’s not entirely clear."
"For now, the US has yet to make the list (even though there's already over a thousand cases here, and also, this bulletin is a bit dated.)I think they take the population into consideration as well - and maybe some politics involved.vietnamembassy-usa.org/news/2020/03/guidance…That could change any day; however, if this trend continues.Maybe I'll give them a call tomorrow.John"
"I'm in Cambodia right now and it seems everyone I've talked to has cancelled their plans for Vietnam. People with friends currently traveling in Vietnam say they're trying to get out as quickly as possible. I have a flight to Hanoi today but will skip it and eat the cost. Until 2 days ago, I was 100% going and not worried at all. Now, it seems like if you do go, you're potentially setting yourself for a logistical nightmare. I'm not concerned about getting sick in Vietnam but the country obviously doesn't want us there so I'm not going.Edited: 8:11 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I've been advised by a tour operator (not agent) that Trang An will be closed from tomorrow. Not sure until when.
"Tran An i both the name of the entire arez and the name of ONT boar ride site located between Tam Coc and Hoa Lu. The area is wide open, the Trang An boat ride is operating,the Tam Coc one is not."
"We are currently in Ninh Binh. As per today (12th March), Trang An boat rides are closed. Cuc Phuong National Park is closing tomorrow. Van Long Nature Reserve boat rides - was open yesterday but have no info about today."
"You have to laugh with the ""wide open"" comments here. Boat tours, attractions, pagodas, temples, Hoa Lu, hotels and restaurants are closed. But hey, the area is wide open. Cross half of the world to see and do nothing and maybe even get quarantined while you are at it."

Hi we were meant to be going on 17th our tour company have cancelled our holiday
"No one from the Dutch group in Hoi An is infected, today they got the tests back."
@AileenInterested in this. Which was your tour company and flying from which UK airport?
Hi we were flying from Glasgow and it was with Wendy wu tours
@AileenThanks for replying. We're booked to go with TUI next Tuesday 17th and they're saying it's still on!
"Hi, We are currently in Vietnam. It's been great as there are not as many tourists as usual. Downside they are starting to cancel tours. We had a 3 day cruise in Halong bay and it was cut short as Cat ba island was shut down. Another hotel we were staying in was closed. Our flight back from Vietnam to South Korea was canceled. We now have to fly to Bangkok and then South Korea Detoit and Canada. I would prefer not to fly through South Korea but we can't get a hold of our insurance or travel company to find out what to do. The Vietnam government is very good at trying to contain it. They take your temperature in alot of restaurants or hotels. Make sure you have a Visa. Good Luck with whatever you decide."
"Hi. We fly to Vietnam tomorrow from Cambodia, but only because we have an e-visa. Once there we will decide what to do. As said previously Ha Long bay is closed, parts of Hanoi and Hoi An are closed, some of our trips have been cancelled and we have had two hotels changed because of CV. Biggest worry is it gets so bad they introduce travel restrictions. When we left 5 days ago we decided to risk it but now, If I wasn’t here and paid up, knowing what I know I wouldn’t come."
Just a big shout out to John P for supplying up to date information on this crisis. We have been in Vietnam for 3 weeks(leaving tomorrow). His updates on this thread from local news and govt have been invaluable. Thank you.
@John P My comment was not directed to you. You are informing and everyone appreciates that.
"Thank you Swampemu.And Alberto, too.I believe better information makes for better decision.On that note, I have a new, very important update.Two provinces in the Mekong Delta (Tien Giang and Dong Thap) just announce that they temporarily suspend all travel services to foreign tourists.https://www.thesaigontimes.vn/301047/noi-tie…This is the first time, an entire province has taken such broad measure.Foreign visitors are not allowed to stay at any lodging nor visit any designated tourist site.For Tien Giang, that means no boat tour to the islets on the Upper Mekong River - the main draw.For Dong Thap, that means no visit to the Tram Chim Natl' Park and the likes.This becomes problematic if other provinces follow suite.I'll try to keep up with the changes for those who are already in VN or are about to visit in the very near future.For those due to arrive in a week, or three, it's only getting more difficult to make the decision (or easier?)JohnEdited: 12:34 pm, March 12, 2020 "

"John PI hope you don't mind, I copied and pasted your info to the Australian post about travelling as a few there were not sure what was going on, I thought it was very informative thanks.Annie,"
Hi!Could someone write all the places closed at the moment (at least for tourists)?
tri1914That would be impossible as it changes hourly. You need to keep researching.
"I just arrived in Hanoi from Ninh Binh / Tam Coc. Yesterday, Trang An boat and Bai Dinh pagoda were still operating, although on the boat you were required to wear a mask and the temples were deserted.Can anyone provide me with an updated on Sapa region? My hostel said that it is closed, but I was able to find a tour online. So what is going on there currently?"
"No cases in the mountains. This said, the Chinese border is 34 km from Sapa, so, it is normal that many hotels are lose for lack of Chinese clients. I just called my friend from Nomad Trails, ex-Sapatrek ; Sapa is wide open, the trekkings are operating, but no more stay in a minority house in Ta Van (OK in Ta Phin)"
"My daughter is flying to vietnam tomorrow but it seems according to UKGOv site that there is a high risk of being quarantined! She does not know what to do and we are all surprised flight has not been cancelled as return flight was and a lot of tourst places are closed!!! any advice??? Looks lije insurance does not cover this either!!!!Edited: 3:12 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"> My daughter is flying to vietnam tomorrowWell, if she's doesn't get there before noon on Sunday, she won't be allowed in.https:/…entry-requirements"
"Thanks for reply yes she arrives very early sunday morning! She is really worried that she will be quarantined: Does not know what this will mean and will lose thousands if insurance does not cover and she decides nit to go! Really airline should cancel as they are flying holiday makers into what potentially could be holiday nighmare, we hear lots of places there are closing too??? Vietnam airline should do the right thing here!Edited: 3:28 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"> Vietnam airline should do the right thing here!The UK should have done the right thing and contained the virus the way the Vietnamese did and we wouldn't have this problem. The Vietnamese had three weeks with no new cases until Europe started sending them back.The tragedy here isn't that people's holidays are messed up, it is that western countries with a far bigger health spend than Vietnam did a far worse job than the Vietnamese did and then exported the problem back to them."
"This might help your daughter decide.2. Re: Should we go home now ?13 Mar. 2020, 8:56 pmSaveHalong Bay and Ninh Binh are now totally closed to visitors. It’s busy in Hanoi, but a lot of hotels are closing. We were evacuated from our hotel in Hanoi this morning because a previous guest reported CoronaVirus. It wasn’t hard to find another place to stay."
"Based on what you are saying The airline should NOT fly us Westerners in then should they!Edited: 5:02 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Airlines are commercial businesses. It's not their job - or right - to make wide-sweeping decisions as to who can and can't fly where. So long as you have a valid passport and visa they have to let you board. Imagine a world where a commercial airline could refuse to fly someone with correct documentation simply because they didn't like their nationality, religion, gender etc.When a non Vietnamese citizen in the UK boards a flight to Vietnam they may be a WHO worker or other professional invited to Vietnam to assist with the global fight against Covid-19. So long as the person has a passport and visa, it's not the airlines job to block or allow people in. One of the best things about the 21st century is that we have a lot of choice. But that means we need to take responsibility.In terms of entering Vietnam for a holiday, as others have said one of the key issues is movement. This is a really really bad time to try move around sightseeing. If you don't like the idea of being stuck in one place (and that does include quarantine), cancel."
Looks like Vietnam Airlines have changed their policy given the latest changes to UK citizens entering:https://www.vietnamairlines.com/~/media/Files/VNANew/Travel%20Information/Covid-19/0313-en-ticket-change-and-refund-covid19.pdf
"""Airlines are commercial businesses. It's not their job - or right - to make wide-sweeping decisions.....""Well said.All of it.Scott"
No need to preach : if you read through what i say it is very likely that anyne flying there from UK Will be put in quarantine and then back in quarantine after return! . This comes from UKGOV own website! The passenger is the airlines customer and in this case should allow the customer the ability to cancel and get money back!!!! SIMPLE most would cancel under these circumstances!
Apprently it has been confirmed to my daughter by the airline that as they cancelled the return flight they would allow her to cancel both ways and get all money back (for both ways)! They did offer a different return date but my daughter will take the refund!!! Commonsense prevails!
"Manatdollar, agree with you.Next 30 days no flight's to Vietnam, hope they get it back under control"
Note that the FCO advice has now changed: The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the whole country.
"Hi all,I cut my trip short and left Vietnam yesterday afternoon via Da Nang international airport and for anyone who has arrived since 7 March and had to fill out the health/travel declaration upon entry, make sure you keep the stamped slip they gave you. A group of women went through the customs checkpoint in front of me and one of the ladies didn’t have the slip. They weren’t speaking English so I’m not 100% sure what was going on but she was arguing with them as they wouldn’t let her through. They kept showing her the slips from the rest of her party and then asked me for mine as I went though, which I luckily kept. I don’t know do this is at all checkpoints but something to bear in mind."
I’m not really sure why Scott keeps posting his inane comments. This thread was supposed to be used to inform people about the situation regarding Coronavirus in Vietnam. He just uses it to get his opinions voiced. The downside of social media. I am visiting Vietnam and use the posts for information and have tried to refrain from even replying to Scott but he is wasting so much space that I felt it was time he was told to stop.
"""I am visiting Vietnam and use the posts for information and have tried to refrain from even replying to Scott but he is wasting so much space that I felt it was time he was told to stop.""Really?How many times have l replied?Anyway, thank you, I'll take your comments on board.And then ignore them.Best of regards,Scott ;-)"
"Tours will stop in Phong Nha from the 17th of March.If anyone is northern, any new info would be appreciated, as we fly back home from Hanoi."
"FYI,Starting March 16th, mask will be required in public space (airports, train and bus stations, supermarkets, etc.)https://m.sggp.org.vn/tu-ngay-163-thuc-hien-…John"
"If it hasn't been reported somewhere on the forum, no visa will be issued at border gates.......US citizens may want to consider this for their travel plan.The VN authority is looking to possibly not allowing travelers from higly-affacted states, on a case-by-case basis.No final decisions have been made, but definitely looks like something that will happen, just a matter of when.https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/web/guest/-/cang-kho…JohnEdited: 1:11 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Friend teaching in Saigon received a message from his employer on Saturday saying that, apparently, the People's Committee and local police were closing bars, clubs, cinemas and other places where people gather in D1 from 6pm (14/3). This is in response to a Czech tourist staying in Bui Vien testing positive. The message advised staying clear of nightclubs and bars for safety reasons, and to avoid similar places in D2 and D7 where expats gather.RegardsrayzaEdited: 1:24 pm, March 14, 2020 "

We arrived on the 10th spent few nights in Ho chi now in nha trang. All I can say is we are most glad to be from NZ we often get asked or we mention straight away we are from NZ when out and about or checking in processes at hotels and we can tell the sense of relief from staff when we say NZ . We have found everywhere so far been open for us and are glad we came .
"I've actually noticed the same. Locals are relieved when they find out I'm from Australia.My hotel in Hanoi have given out police forms to all guests this morning asking them when and where they entered Vietnam, what flight number, what hotels they have stayed at in the last 14 days, and what hotels they will stay at in the next 14 days.Strange thing is that they have not asked for personal information such as name and contact details.. maybe the hotel will enter that information?Edited: 11:09 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"#903 Hi Virginia, you were lucky. NZ posted travel bans last night which will affect you when you arrive back in the country. 14 day mandatory self isolation for all. It was quite a shock when we heard."
Totally agree
Yes we live rurally on a farm so we self isolate a lot anyways at times so will find it not to hard to do was reading the news and in our situation not to worried.
"""...when you arrive back in the country. 14 day mandatory self isolation for all.""In Australia now, as well.Scott"
"News Update.An Giang Province (Chau Doc, Sam mountain, Tra Su forest) joins the other two provinces in the Mekong (Tien Giang and Dong Thap) on the ban to ALL foreign visitors, including hotels/lodging.baovanhoa.vn/du-lich/artmid/416/articleid/27…Ben Tre Province did not specify a lodging ban, just closure of tourist areas and prohibition to receive ALL foreign visitors (no tours nor guide).https://vov.vn/xa-hoi/dbscl-3-dia-phuong-tam…In Ninh Binh , the ban applies only to visitors from the ""black-listed"" countries where Covid-19 is spreading.https://baoquocte.vn/phong-dich-covid-19-nin…John"
"Saigon and Hanoi both places a broad ban on entertainment in general on bars, dancing halls, movie theaters, massage parlors, and all entertainment events for the rest of March.""bar, karaoke, vũ trường, games online, rạp chiếu phim, cơ sở massage, chương trình biểu diễn nghệ thuật trên địa bàn tạm dừng hoạt động đến hết tháng 3.""John"
"A similar entertainment ban is also in effect in Da Nang.Several provinces had closed up tourist areas like Phu Yen, Binh Dinh, Khanh Hoa, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, Quang Binh, Hue.That means no visit to any Cham Tower (including the My Son ruins), no cave expedition/visitVN Airlines had suspended all flights to/from the Schengen area.In another word, it's not a time to travel any longer.Regards,John"
"> VN Airlines had suspended all flights to/from the Schengen area.They went back on that.…vietnamairlines.com/vi/tintuc/news-114/viet…Still a ban on **TOURISTS** flying in from UK/Schengen, but they will carry passengers who> meet all health requirements to fly back to and enter Vietnam,so I expect they'll all have plenty of room to lie down."
"News Update.VN's case count is now up to 57There's now some 10 different sources of infection (passengers on different flights) and many of them are new, so the risk of spreading is increasing exponentially as visitors that traveled on those flights are now dispersing all over the country.This is really not the time to travel, what with tourist sites in various provinces/cities being shut down left-and-right.There are also bans on foreign tourists in certain provinces as well.That will most likely be followed by other provinces in the near future.Stay safe, people.John"
"yes I was always going to Vietnam, the situation has changed considerably across the world. i will not be traveling and now recommend other do not travel also"

"Hi Anna, hope you are all safe and well! Did you get anywhere with the airlines? We are booked to fly with Vietnam Airlines tomorrow, booked via FlyVietnam. The flight is now cancelled (or as they say suspended) but FlyVietnam would not offer full refund. They want to charge cancellation fee and ticketing fee, basically they want to charge 1/3 of the original amount paid. I think this is disgusting and I'm trying to see what I can do to fight them.Regards"
"Hi Giga D,I'm sorry that you have this experience. Vietnam Airlines does offer a full refund if cancellation is from their end and the ticket was booked on their website. However, they make no warranty of how much you could get back if you booked via a travel agent. I agree that it is disgusting for the agent to charge any fees in this circumstance. Do they have any terms of reference based on which you could appeal?"

"Hi, thanks for your response. No, there is nothing and when I went to ask for partial refunds they said that they are not offering no refund at all and said this is based on strict policy of the airlines. Really upsetting."
