I recently had as guests in my guesthouse on Margarita a couple from Trinidad whom operate a passenger boat service from Tucupita Venezuela to Trinidad and return.If anyone needs the contact info for this service you can message me here.I was told the trip from Tucupita return is Bs 60000.
"hello, how far is Maracaibo from you?"
Maracaibo to Margarita is approximately 700 kms.
How much is that in USD? And how long is the journey?Thanks :)
In usd its approximately $70 and it is 3 hours. Two hours on a tributary of the Orinoco river then a crossing to Trinidad of approx. 45 minutes.
Is this this service still in operation? I am interested in a one way trip from Trinidad to Venezuela in August. I will be traveling on to Caracas from Tucupita. Any information you could provide in terms of cost and availability would be very welcome.
"Check your personal messages-I sent you the contact info. It has been a few monthes since I spoke to these people but my guess is that its still happening.I would not expect it to be any luxury cruise but an adventure, yes.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Can I get their phone number. I am in tucupita now. February, 25. 2017. I need to get to trinidad. Thanks.Kindest Regards.Curtis."
Curtis-I tried calling but no answer on the Venezuela cell phone try the Trinidad number.Chamin and CoroVen. 0414 868 353 5401Trinidad 001 868 353 5401
"Can you please provide another number for Trinidad, 353 5401 is going into voicemail, I want to make this trip, can anyone here provide details please, traveling from Trinidad to Tucupita and back."
Sorry these are the only numbers I have.
Thank you very much.
"Is anyone having trouble with internet in Porlamar these last month or two? My wifes internet at home keeps disconnecting long periods of time. They also have friends and other family going through the same issue. The company said its an insect problem, which I find kind of weird. They're with Bante. I think thats the name."
Bante? Is it not CANTV?
I have CANTV ABA in Playa El Agua and for the last 2 weekends we had no connection for approximately 36 hours.Last weekend was sometime Saturday night to late afternoon on Monday.Some news sources are reporting failures in their platform throughout the country.Our business land line has been out of service since Dec. 2 even with repeated calls to CANTV service.
There are reports in the oppo news that the military has intervened in internet services to monitor email and social media. Could this have something to do with that?
"Not likely. Email like Gmail is encrypted.They would need your password and you can check what IPs are accessing your mail within Gmail.Cel phones are another story.Things like text messages using their system are clearly visible as well as voice calls.If you are using WhatsApp then it's encrypted.They would like to monitor everything but it's really difficult.Social media depends on your permissions.FaceBook you need to have set on ""Friends & Family"" only and then review who is on your list of friends. Eliminate anyone you don't know.Don't set it on ""Friends of Friends"" I believe the blackouts are being caused by failing equipment that they don't readily have replacement parts for.Also no new investment in replacing old equipment.Edited: 3 years ago "
oh sorry I guess it is CANTV. Just hoping this can be solved soon. My wife was also telling me the government might be behind this. But just really hope not.
It's just the usual no maintenance and no new infrastructure.Things wear out and there are no $$ to replace the parts.

Hi i need your help
I will be in Trinidad in a couple of weeks and was wondering if I can travel cheaply to Venezuela for a quick day trip.
"Khaled, sorry but now, the fast way is the plane, which flights to Caracas and is no cheap. The no so fast but cheap option are the boats to Tucupita, only that will take you 8 hours the round trip without counting the time in the immigration offices that last time I did it it was very long in Trinidad. So you would have the time in one day.Finally if you took one of those boats you will only see the sea, some jungle and the Orinoco Delta which is a wonderful place, but I don't know if that's what you would like to see during a one day trip."
