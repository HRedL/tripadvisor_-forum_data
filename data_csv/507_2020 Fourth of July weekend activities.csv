"Would like to hear opinions/information on the likelihood of Chicago being “up & running” for visitors by the Fourth weekend. Also, any activities and events currently planned, e.g. not cancelled yet, for that time. We know Chicago fairly well, and would like to visit that weekend, but given the current situation with the pandemic, we would like some local opinions on how it looks from the local perspective. Thanks for any advice. Susan"
I'd give it a 0% chance. Plan for 2021. Chicago isn't a good place for the 4th anyway.
Non-existant.
"We'll be lucky if there are any restaurants open by then for anything but drive-thru, pick-up or delivery. Everything is closed, including the lakefront, the parks, the RiverWalk, the 606. You are better off in Indiana."
Yep. Definitely make other plans.B.
"We’ve been told by knowledgeable leaders that Illinois may finally peak in Mid-June. July 4the celebrations will not happen. Which is no big deal since our 4th of July celebrations have been less than anemic since Jane “Bread & Circuses” Byrne left office.Edited: 4:26 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"This post just echoes everyone else's replies, but figured I'd exercise my ""Post your reply"" point and click muscles.The State announced 192 new fatalities today, which is the largest single-day spike so far. Illinois has put together a re-opening plan that divides the state into 4 regions, each region upon meeting certain criteria can advance to the next phase of re-opening. The earliest date anyone can advance is May 28th (or right around there). The Northeast region (Chicago and surrounding area) is not on track to advance at this point. Mayor Lightfoot gave a speech today to the Economic Club of Chicago, and from those comments it is very unlikely tourist / visitor activities will be available any time soon: https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…No estimate for opening the lakefront parks and trail, which really is a bummer.Edited: 5:07 pm, May 13, 2020 "
Our village in the western suburbs has cancelled the annual Fourth of July parade and fireworks. I imagine all towns are cancelling the festivities this year.
The suburbs have to cancel. If they don't a million people will show up lol.
Not at all likely.
we might as well write off 2020 as a non year..........................................
"For 2020 I agree, it won't happen."
Finally a post where everyone agrees LOL
I disagree that we all agree.:)B.
"WOW, everyone in the CHIFo agreeing with ME?!?!?!?Never woulda thought in a million years........."
"There’s a first-time for everything, S-T. But knowing this forum, don’t get used to it...."
Zero.
"""There’s a first-time for everything, S-T. But knowing this forum, don’t get used to it....""This is something new for everyone though and affecting all ages."
Thank you all very much. It’s a clear answer(s). I’ve cancelled the hotel Rez.
Appears Taste of Chicago May be a go with different rules nowhttps:/…taste_of_chicago.html
I'm not sure where you got that idea from.
Jb that page was live long before COVID-19.
"Ok I couldn’t find anything else on it, thought that was most recent."
Not a chance
