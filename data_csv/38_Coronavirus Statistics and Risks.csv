Great thread !
A great read!! Wash. Your. Hands.
Thanks FM
"“ At present there are 1,606 confirmed coronavirus cases in France with 30 deaths and 12 recovered. With a population of 66,524,000 that means .0024% of the population have the virus.” I have been following the situation closely as we have a trip to Paris planned for June. The number of cases in France and Germany has been doubling approximately every week or two, as the spread of this virus is increasing exponentially. Given this trajectory, the situation could approach that of Italy within the next month or two, if things continue along the path they are on."
"Hi jayinSF - As I mentioned, I'm trying to keep comments on this thread limited to current statistical, factual sourced based data (not speculation) so while I thank you for reading and commenting please try to keep any future comments restricted to current stats/facts and not speculation."
"Thanks for this, FM. I appreciate the facts and information, minus the panic. I agree with a Dr. I heard on TV yesterday say that we may be causing more harm to each other with the anxiety of the virus than the actual virus."
I find that the best source for watching the evolution of the situation like a video game is the interactive data base from Johns Hopkins:https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6
"Best paper which outlines the clinical spectrum of the disease IMO is a JAMA paper by Wu and McGoogan. It reports on 72000 cases- basically just more than 80% mild treated at home. 15% ""serious"" which basically meant hospitalization and 5% critical meaning an ICU admission. If that happened a 50% mortality in this sub group. The problem is that if Italy as of today has around 10000 cases which means about 500 are in the ICU. The critical care units are being overwhelmed. Because of the scarcity of these beds, people who will be most likely to survive are being admitted through a strict triage. Guidelines are published so very few if anyone over 70 is admitted. As a traveler to an epidemic area you would be facing an overwhelmed system even if you went in with a non covid illness. Again this is something that has to be considered. I have had to cancel my trip which was a meeting in Brussels as the meeting was postponed. I have made a very difficult decision to cancel a week visiting Paris after the meeting...in part because of my concern that some of the things I want to visit my be shut but really because we have been told at work that we really shouldn't take vacation as they anticipate people off with illness and those who are well have to pick up the slack!"
"Hi, unfortunately my post did provide current factual information. I understand that exponential spread is not easy to grasp, but it in fact is based on “statistical” fact, not “speculation. Currently the known cases are doubling every 19 days. Here’s an article that explains what is happening: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growt…I wish it were not the case since as I mentioned, we are planning a trip on June that looks increasingly less likely to happen."
"With respect, while the facts in the original post are broadly correct, that's not all the authorities are worried about and not all you should be worried about.20% of people who catch the virus become too sick to work, and many of them require hospitalisation. If everyone caught the virus, both the economy and the medical system would collapse. Even if only half the population caught the virus, there would still be a devastating impact, quite apart from the huge number of deaths. This has already been seen in China.That's why global authorities are implementing drastic measures to limit the spread of the virus, ranging from lockdown (Italy) to forced quarantine on immigration (Israel). The fewer people catch it, the fewer will have to miss work or stay in hospital, and the fewer deaths there will be.Anyone who carries on as normal is potentially facilitating the spread of the virus, and indirectly facilitating deaths, serious illness and economic devastation. Not an overstatement."
"kerouac - Thanks for the link. vintagebabe - Yes, that references what I mentioned in regards to travel restrictions. jayinSF - Now I see your point. More a case of extrapolation rather than speculation but still relevant with the clarification. Now that I've stirred up controversy I'll likely drop out of this thread and let people add their comments but hopefully people will stay true to the topic and only post stats and sources. I just thought it would be useful to have a thread with facts and stats rather than just thoughts and opinions, since those threads seem to be comprise the majority of the TA coronavirus threads thus far. I like throwing a hand grenade into a room and then running away. ;)"
"The Johns Hopkins interactive world map is telling. Since last week the dots have been getting larger for some areas.Edited: 2:34 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Thanks for posting facts.
"as others have mentioned, great info.unfortunately like many PSAs it will fall on deaf ears. Not many people care about stats or reading anything anymore.They prefer to live by OPO. Look at the fact you can look up wether stats and who does? Its easier to ask, ""will it rain tomorrow"" or ""will it rain when im in x on day y""Just look at all of the same questions posted everyday. however i get what and why you are doing what you do. I just do it for my own info and to become more informed.but keep up the good work."
"Thanks to the folks who appreciate my efforts (and if you don't appreciate my efforts thanks for not calling me an a%%ho§e). I'm a pretty simple guy. I have a college degree but I'm well aware I'm not the smartest guy in the room. If I were to sum up my post in just a couple of sentences then I guess the takeaway is that the coronavirus is definitely a serious health concern but for ""the moment"" the greatest risk for the majority of folks on this forum is how it may affect your travel plans and since it is an evolving situation you'll need to check for daily updates."

If you're booked to travel to France for an event, make sure you check with the organisers to see if it's still going ahead.For those who have travelling from a country where ""the virus is actively circulating"", the French government has said that they should monitor their temperature twice a day for 14 days, wear surgical masks when with relatives or outside the house, and avoid non-essential activies and at-risk individuals.The French government also has a website with dedicated advice, which is updated daily but in French only."
Daisy your post is not accurate.
FM nice work as usual.
"I came across this article about the virus' persistence on inanimate surfaces such as plastic, paper, wood, etc...https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(20)30046-3/pdf"
"Might as well start in the beginning.From the NY Times.Dec. 31Chinese authorities treated dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause.On Dec. 31, the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases. Days later, researchers in China identified a new virus that had infected dozens of people in Asia. At the time, there was no evidence that the virus was readily spread by humans. Health officials in China said they were monitoring it to prevent the outbreak from developing into something more severe.Jan. 11China reported its first death.On Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported the first known death from an illness caused by the virus, which had infected dozens of people. The 61-year-old man who died was a regular customer at the market in Wuhan, where the illness is thought to have originated, and he had previously been found to have abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease. The report of his death came just before one of China’s biggest holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.Jan. 20Other countries, including the United States, confirmed cases.The first confirmed cases outside mainland China occurred in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to the World Health Organization’s first situation report. The first confirmed case in the United States came the next day in Washington State, where a man in his 30s developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan.____So within 10 days of China's first fatality testing kits were available to at least major government disease hubs like the CDC for the US, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.From the New England Journal of Medicine, the guy flew into Seattle Washington from China.""On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China."""
I don’t think that the disease killing off primarily “older” people or people with “pre-existing conditions” is a non-issue. I think it’s cruel that people see it as a mitigating factor. Sick of this argument.
"Doby47 - Please re-read what I wrote and tell me where I ever said ""the disease killing off primarily “older” people or people with “pre-existing conditions” is a non-issue."" And make sure if you are going to quote me that you don't ""cherry pick"" and take quotes out of context. I did nothing but report statistics and made it quite clear that I only wanted this thread to be a place to report factual and sourced statistics. I also invited anyone with factual/sourced based statistics to post on this thread. So if you've got statistical/fact based data you'd like to post on this thread then you are welcome to do so."
FMystique- my comment is not directed at you. It’s a general thought in reaction to many people’s comments. My parents and relatives are “elderly”. My husband is in his 60s and has some health issues. So the stats don’t make me feel ok at all.
"As an empathetic human being I understand Doby and I'm glad you clarified and I hope you don't take this next remark personally but I can't help the fact that stats don't make you feel comfortable. Science doesn't care about anyone's comfort level. It's like saying ""I know electricity turns on my light bulb but I'm not comfortable with it""."
All of us have parents or older relatives. All of us have health issues or love someone who does. It DOES NOT mitigate the danger of this virus (much higher than the flu %) to say “it mainly kills the elderly or those with health issues-so no big deal!”
"Doby- I thought we just went through this (you know, my parents are in their mid 80's) and came to a resolution. I'm not going to repeat what I've already said."
"RE: Original Post: ""The real risk is that those who may have the virus and display no symptoms can spread the disease to those in the high risk categories...""FM - have you run across anything indicating the percentage of asymptomatic spreaders? Maybe it's impossible at this point for the experts to have an educated guess. If that number is high, it would really affect how people feel about traveling."
They don’t yet know the extent to which people who are asymptomatic can spread it.
"reneet960 - I'm sorry I don't have an English language article so here is my source for that quote (in French, which was provided in original post):Quels risques chez les enfants ?2% des personnes contaminées sont des enfants ou adolescents. Le Dr Pierre Parneix, médecin de santé publique expert sur le Covid-19 explique que la plupart d'entre eux sont peu symptomatiques, voire porteurs du virus sans même le savoir. ""Ils peuvent en revanche être vecteurs de la maladie, d'où l'importance de ne pas les amener dans une collectivité de gens fragiles, comme les maisons de retraites et de leur apprendre à bien se laver les mains fréquemment"" insiste le spécialiste. Aucun n'a présenté de formes graves et aucun n'est décédé à date en France."
"Post #15: ""the greatest risk for the majority of folks""In relation to risk, the risk of travelling with mild symptoms is also being a transmitter - not just a risk to oneself (of illness and/or quarantine) but a risk of infecting others.So there is no free pass on responsibility if people travel in this condition - a person should take precautions who has the identified symptoms of Covid19: runny nose, sore throat, cough and a fever:""In most adults, an oral or axillary temperature above 37.6°C (99.7°F) or a rectal or ear temperature above 38.1°C (100.6°F) is considered a fever.""If you have had the flu you will know that ""prickly"" feeling that comes before and/or with a temperature. The other marker is that a person has been in contact with someone from overseas, particularly areas where Covid19 has been identified as in the community. Overseas travellers cannot be sure of whom they have been in contact in airports, public transport, hotels, restaurants etcSuch a person should avoid others. Seek a medical assessment - don't rely on self-assessment. Mask up if in public, and if confirmed with Covid19, stay away from other people for 14 days."
"Thanks for the comments GRA but my post in #15 was my own personal opinion and I made it clear that I was not being an expert so any quote taken from that post should not be taken in partial or quoted as an expert fact (you only partially quoted what I said, which as I clearly stated was my own personal summary, not a quote from an accredited source). Here is my full statement from #15:""If I were to sum up my post in just a couple of sentences then I guess the takeaway is that the coronavirus is definitely a serious health concern but for ""the moment"" the greatest risk for the majority of folks on this forum is how it may affect your travel plans and since it is an evolving situation you'll need to check for daily updates."""
"Thank you for the information FM. The facts are what is most important, not opinionsI will be paying attention to this forum as well as both the French and United States recommendations since I have a Trip planned to Paris with me and my family March 19. I trust both governments recommendations more than anything and am aware things do change without notice depending on the situation."
"From my point of view life itself is a Risk , anyone has equal chance to catch the virus while he is at his own home or he is at a foreign country , So the same senario of isloate , quarantee ....etc can happen in his own country , so everyone who want to enjoy his trip must take the risk that can anything happen while he travel like plane crash , car accident ....etc, i am risk taker and my travel plan on the 2 nd of April and so far it is the same as i see till date the satistic in France is smilar to a lot of countries apart from Italy, china, south korea and iran"
** Might as well start in the beginning. **ATF: Great job.I hope you can retrofit your narrative to include the story about the BAT soup :-)
"Boeing!! How are you doing over there??Boots on the ground, anyone gone berserkers.."
"** Boeing!! How are you doing over there?? **ATF, good question and thanks for asking. I came down with the symptoms of the deadly virus an about 3 weeks ago (high fevers, cough, sever body aches, etc.). I started taking antibiotics, zinc, vitamin C, plenty of hot fluids and stayed home ever since.Luckily, after 10 days I started feeling great again. The situation here on the ground is rather dire and that's why I am afraid to go to the hospital to get tested. I called the government hotline and they advised, if you feel good just stay home."
"Boedude, I had a feeling.. was hoping I was simply misfiring. Glad you are better, glad your antibiotics worked against your bacteria and glad you can stay at home.Maybe you can order a new home testing kit from Bill Gates, he just invented them: https://www.fastcompany.com/90474552/seattle… Or let's hope of the 250-500,000 common flu cases you're simply 501.Are the western statistics for Iran the same as what local TV is saying..? The videos I have seen spirited out of your area look eerily similar to ones from China. The confluence in disparity noted.Take care.I get similar symptoms every time I meet my mother-in-law..)"
"** Maybe you can order a new home testing kit from Bill Gates,.... **ATF: Oh boy, I have a feeling you will be haunted by a relentless stalker soon (LOL)** Are the western statistics for Iran the same as what local TV is saying..? **I have seen that the statistics given by CNN, NY Times and the France24 (English) are in harmony with the local state media here but the actual figures are NOT really known.** The videos I have seen spirited out of your area look eerily similar to ones from China. The confluence in disparity noted **Certainly, Iran is the hardest hit by the COVID-19 after the mainland China. The unusual influx of Chinese tourists, whom visited Iran during this Chinese New Year might, had something to do with it.I hope that the world goes through this arduous odyssey with the least casualties."

"When FM wrote this, the available stats were primarily from China. Last week a Harvard Epidemiologist estimated 40-60% of Americans will fall ill. Yesterday US Senate staff were advised by a doctor to the Senate that they are estimating 70-150M Americans will fall ill. That is about 25 - 50% of the population, which is pretty low compared to Merkel’s estimate for Germany which is 66%.He also estimates a fatality rate of 1%. That is 700,000 to 1.5M deaths in the US. 520,000 deaths in Germany. If you use FM’s fatality rate of 3,5% who fall ill, the number of expected fatalities increases dramatically. Western gov’ts (except Italy) are not telling us to self-quarantine right now. That doesn’t mean it’s not a wise thing to do. They need to balance the health and economic repercussions of the situation. As individuals we need to do the same and right now is not the time to use any form of public transportation (including ferries, trains or planes) or to be in a group situation for a leisure activity. It is not the time to travel. Be smart. Be safe. Stay home."
"Might as well keep track of vaccine stats...To review, patient zero in China identified in Wuhan, patient zero for the USA identified in Seattle returning from Wuhan, first home testing kits coming to market from Bill Gates in Seattle, first drive thru testing centers pop up in Seattle, Seattle like San Francisco to stop quarantine of infected people.And now the first hopeful vaccine is on schedule for Seattle, Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute.The vaccine maker can move forward as soon as they get 45 volunteers paid 1,100 each if they complete the study.Google: Recruitment Begins for First Coronavirus Vaccine Trial Seattle-area test will pay participants $1,100 ___Chief Seattle ( c. 1786 – June 7, 1866) was a Suquamish and Duwamish chief.

"#47-let's not get too caught up in statistics. I too saw the testimony, and he didn't estimate fatality numbers at all. He said that the virus was 10x deadlier than the common flu-and made it clear that his point was how the nation needed to take the threat seriously.He did not estimate death totals, and to do so is entirely unhelpful and alarmist."
"hrTraveler – I am referring to a closed door meeting with senate staff and not the public House oversight committee hearings. In the meeting minutes that I read, he mentions a 1% rate of those that get ill, not the population at large."
"A reminder about making predictions and their variability and the need to not partially quote things but ""fully quote"" where sourced info is coming from. I just did about a two second google search and will post a link to a Washington Post article from 18 hours ago:""Another forecast, developed by former CDC director Tom Frieden at the nonprofit organization Resolve to Save Lives, found that deaths in the United States could range widely, depending on what percentage of the population becomes infected and how lethal the disease proves to be. Frieden, who oversaw the U.S. response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 Ebola epidemic and the 2016 Zika epidemic, says that in a worst-case scenario, but one that is not implausible, half the U.S. population would become infected and more than 1 million people would die.His team put together a simple table that looks at various scenarios using case fatality ratios ranging from .1, similar to seasonal flu, to .5, a moderately severe pandemic, and 1.0, a severe one. The infection rate ranged from 0.1 percent of the population to 50 percent. That put the range of deaths at 327 (best case) to 1,635,000 (worst case). The deaths would not necessarily happen over a month or a year, but could occur over two or three years, he said.""So, IN A WORST CASE SCENARIO half the population could become infected. The article also confirms the facts in my original post, that most people recover and it is the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions who are most likely to die.""Let me re-quote one other thing from the above article:""That put the range of deaths at 327 (best case) to 1,635,000 (worst case).""Wow, so anywhere from 327 to 1,635,000 people in the U.S. could die. That's certainly a very precise prediction with little range in variability (insert sarcasm here). Once again, we're dealing with predictions and estimates vs. CURRENT statistical data that can be actually quantified. I said the other day that this was not a pandemic according to the WHO and that has changed since I posted. Was I wrong? No, because I didn't provide a personal opinion and relied on CURRENT information. I also said ""BUT KEEP CHECKING DAILY FOR UPDATED INFO AND ANY GOVERNMENT IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS."" So the current change to pandemic status is in line with my above quote. Oh, there is so much more I want to stay but I'll stay within my own self-imposed guidelines and stick to reporting just CURRENT facts and not offer my own opinion."
"The alternative facts and fake news are changing so fast that that is the wisest course of action.Plenty of real facts have been given on this thread, but just about everything said here expires within about six hours except from a historical point of view.Edited: 11:37 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Also, I am not going to listen to what Macron has to say tonight. Why? Because he is a politician, not an expert, and as such he is a second or third hand source of information. But more importantly, being a politician he has other things to worry about besides current statistical info, most importantly ABOUT GETTING RE-ELECTED and satisfying a whole range of special interest groups and other global corporate entities that give him money (ah, campaign funds and a profit motive) that will ensure that he remains in office. I WILL pay attention to what he has to say about changes in government policy because as a politician he is in charge of the laws of the land and creates rules which I must abide by."
"K2 - Yes. The info is changing daily/hourly and I made that clear. I also made it clear to KEEP CHECKING DAILY FOR......""........ugh. I don't even feel like re-quoting the rest of my quote. I think I'm just going to stay inside so when the sky falls I won't get hit."
** I'll stay within my own self-imposed guidelines and.... not offer my own opinion **Inculcating the guideline repeatedly (i.e semi daily) might be the ONLY beacon of hope to stop spurious posts :-)
"Phread-at no point did Dr Fauci estimate there would be deaths in the 1% range; he was rebutting the point-a political talking point for some here in the USA that COVID19 is no more deadly than the flu-that as it stood now, COVID19 is ten times more lethal than the flu. Fauci never said, and never estimated, a 1% death rate-ever."
"I am quoting facts....From the meeting with Monahan, not Fauci...Reported by NBC News...Infectious disease experts say the virus so far appears to be deadlier and more contagious than the seasonal flu, with many experts and U.S. health officials saying the mortality rate is likely somewhere around 1%, making it at least 10 times as lethal as the flu. Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard, said earlier this month that he thinks about 40% to 70% of the world's population could become infected with the virus, and of those, 1% will die."
"You are not quoting facts-you are quoting estimations from people who don't know what they are talking about. And you clearly don't understand the difference between what is a fact and what is a hypothesis or estimation. And any estimation applied to public health is a risky and often unreliable endeavor.Why do you persist?-your information is misleading at best and flat wrong at worst. As is clear from the following, in light of the very limited information-in the USA, anyway-the numbers you use are way too high.https://www.yahoo.com/news/deadly-coronaviru…"
"I'll reiterate (for the umpteenth time) that for anyone who wants to quote facts (which is the purpose of this thread) DO NOT QUOTE PARTIAL FACTS (partial fact quotes taken out of context are as misleading and irrelevant as thoughts and opinions) AND BE SURE TO PROVIDE RELEVANT LINKS TO ANY SOURCE FROM WHICH YOU ARE QUOTING. And estimates and projections are not facts, though I feel less inclined to ask that they not be quoted because they are not necessarily irrelevant to the spirit of the thread."
"The idea is to quote facts and to avoid unreliable data or personal opinion. I agree that estimation in regards to public health is risky. The fatality rate is a useful indicator (a fact) if computed by actual numbers or close to it (a fact) and not estimation (an unreliable data). The COVID-19 outbreak is currently in the state of flux. If the data acquisition facilities in any country can provide their public health officials (the IF is a BIG word here) with the actual daily-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the actual lost lives by the virus then THEIR fatality rate indicator is a meaningful fact (whether is 1%, 3.4% or 50%)."
"This man is an expert on the subject from Harvard. There are no facts for what will happen because it has never happened before. There is NO data for what will happen. I PERSIST because this is a travel site and people use it to make travel plans and people should not travel right now. Even if they don’t get ill, they may participate in somebody else getting ill and dying.I PERSIST because 15113 cases in Italy as of today, 1016 deaths. That is considerably more than any of the stats I have quoted and much much more than the “facts” in the OP.I PERSIST because the way China handled the crisis has nothing to do with how it is being handled in Italy or the US, so there are NO statistics, just very educated guesses.I PERSIST because if people get this, it may save lives. Why do you refuse to face the evidence?"
"phread - I have avoided singling you out because I know you and like you. But I have tried to create a thread different from the countless other threads on TA where people can turn to to get CURRENT FACTUAL DATA/STATS WITH RELEVANT LINKS TO THE SOURCE MATERIALS FOR SAID QUOTES/FACTS. THIS IS NOT A THREAD FOR PEOPLE TO POST THEIR BULLETIN BOARD MATERIAL NOR TO LASH OUT AT THOSE THEY DISAGREE WITH. In the spirit of what I have posted I can not refrain from putting aside my personal relationship to you so with that said: Can you please refrain from posting your thoughts/opinions/personal interpretation of the facts on this thread and do so on another coronavirus thread (which are innumerable)? This is not a thread to warn people, promote an agenda, promote a personal belief, rebuke those you disagree with etc., etc. I have simply asked that if you are going to post on this thread that you refrain from ""posting an opinion/provide a warning"" and that you ONLY POST IF YOU HAVE FACTS/STATS WITH RELEVANT LINKS TO THE SOURCES OF YOUR FACTS/STATS. I think I've made this pretty clear already. Please don't take this personally but we're in territory that extends beyond personal relationships here. I hold no grudge or animosity towards you and still consider you a valuable contributor to the TA forum and I'm sorry for singling you out but as I mentioned, I've created a thread with specific guidelines and am hoping that people will respect those guidelines so that the thread doesn't run off the rails."
"Hey FM, I respect you, as well and I appreciate your concern over singling me out. I understand you prefer stats and links, but thats my job outside of TA and I really don’t have the energy to then hunt the links down again for these posts, but I do have valuable information. My numbers on Italy today are solid. If anyone wants to google them, I’m good with that. If they want to call me out when I’m wrong, I’m good with that, too.I am not trying to rain on your project, but the stats on what happened in China in no way reflect what is happening in Europe and because this is a forum about travel to Paris, my posts remain relavent. If you feel my posts break the rules for TA, please feel free to have them removed. I won’t be offended."
These are stats that matterhttps://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca
"HRH - During the testimony Fauci said the seasonal flu has a 0,1% fatality rate and the Coronavirus is ten times more lethal than that. Maybe my math is off, but pretty sure that’s the one percent you said he never mentioned.https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-be…"
"Facts are facts; estimates, suppositions, and extrapolations are just that, and are not facts.So here's a fact: nobody-except you-has estimated a 1% fatality rate, as you have written. You clearly have no understanding how health statistics are compiled, what's valid, and what's a relevant sample size.Simply put, to quote Twain thinking he was quoting Disraeli:""There are three types of lies; lies, damn lies, and statistics."" This especially applies to ""statistics"" gleaned from faulty analysis."
"Thank you for understanding phread and not taking my post as a personal attack against you. I have no ability to remove anyone's posts, nor do I want to. Removing posts is a function of a certain number of TA community members reporting a post as inappropriate or from TA staff themselves removing a post. I have not reported yours or any other posts as inappropriate. All I ask is that people keep this post free from their own interpretation of data and do nothing but post stats/facts with links to their sources. And as an extra reminder, providing a personal interpretation/summary of an article one has read does not qualify as posting facts/stats with linked sources, no matter how sincere or fact verified such a post may be."
Sorry FM just wanted to say how lovely it is to see two adults resolve an issue. We don’t see it enough in this day an age on social media. Now goodnight to you all.
"You're welcome Jann58 and thanks for your contributions to this thread. Actually, there was nothing to resolve. Phread and I have known each other for a while and all I wanted to do was make sure that I clarified the parameters under which I wanted people to post on this thread and make clear to phread that I was not launching a personal attack.

"I have a doctorate in human biology.I would advise all of you to quit trying to do your own stats.There are no controlled studies. No nation on the planet is testing everyone - so no one knows how many people are actually infected. Many cases are asymptomatic or mild (we do know that). But many individuals are vulnerable. To date, I'd say these groups are vulnerable:Everyone over 50 (increasing with age)People with any form of immune disorder People with diabetes, regardless of typePeople with high blood pressurePeople with a family history of fibrotic lung diseasePeople who regularly see the elderlyPeople who work in hospitals or high transit areasThere's a lot more to know - but you can't run stats on how many people are affected without knowing how many people are INfected.We aren't using test kits to do research. We are using test kits on people with symptoms. There's a worldwide shortage of test kits. Of people who have been tested (all of whom had reason to go ask for a test or to be required a test), about 3% are dying. Just as the regular reporters on this stat will say (trust the CDC, not me - if they revise, go with tht figure).Again, most people are asymptomatic but **still able to transmit a disease to the person next to them - who might not be as invulnerable as the person transmitting.**Edited: 9:04 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"""I would advise all of you to quit trying to do your own stats.""I believe that was the essential point of my post. And everything else you said is 100% in line with what I've posted so far (stats are current and don't account for the vast majority of people who are not yet diagnosed and reported, and this information is provided in the links posted if people care to read them). The point of this thread is to get people to pay attention to the sources of the most current information, not to post their thoughts and opinions or interpret a report they've read and provide their own summary. The link posted in #71 makes it pretty clear that we're dealing with a lot a vagueness right now. But people are looking for information and links such as that are the best that can be provided. People should get their advice from accredited sources, read the advice, understand that there is much that is not known and then learn to live within the limits of the present regulations that have been imposed by various governments."
"And just to be clear, when you say ""I have a doctorate in human biology. I would advise all of you to quit trying to do your own stats."" I don't know who the ""all"" is that you are referring to in this thread. I don't hold any advanced degrees but I am intellectually curious enough to do my own research on a wide variety of topics (the internet and books are great tools to educate yourself without the need of an advanced degree) so hopefully you are also educated on common debating fallacies that relegate any proposed argument/hypothesis as invalid that fall within fallacy guidelines, such as ""arguing from the weight of authority"". http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/fallacies.html"
Thank you for taking the time to inform us.
"Since yesterday, France went from 2284 to 2876 cases and from 48 deaths to 61, so things are definitely speeding up here."
"** HRH - During the testimony Fauci said the seasonal flu has a 0,1% fatality rate **Hello phread, post #61 was not directed at you and similar to OP, I like you. The basic message in #61 is ""reliable data collection leads to reliable meaningful statistic, facts, indicators, etc.""."
"+1 with LeBiscuitD in post #73. I'm involved in a lot of clinical studies, and while I appreciate F_M's efforts (and F_M himself), we're far from an acceptable level of scientific rigour here on TA, which is to be expected of course. For example, in the OP it is stated that the infection rate in France, at that time, is 0.0024%. This assumes that every single person who was actually infected was indeed tested. Highly unlikely. It would have been better to say the infection rate is AT THE VERY LEAST 0.0024%.I'm only aware of one valid clinical study and this was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on Feb 28 by Chinese doctors. This study wont help the average person sitting at home as a) it deals more with the clinical effects and outcomes more than the epidemiological aspect, and b) because of the inclusion criteria.The study is freely accessible on the NEJM website. There may be more valid studies, but I haven't checked recently."
"Published statistics are way off. You are only getting reported, confirmed cases. So a lot of underreporting. Two links to post:Statistically, this victim is listed as a recovered survivor.

"For anybody wondering, that's why the reported number of cases in the United States is still so low -- they don't even have the testing kits in most places."

"I agree. While the virus does have a higher death rate than the current strain of flu I feel you are more apt to catch the current flu than COVID-19. The flu has spread by far faster than COVID-19. By some reports, flu in the USA has increased by 4 million in the last week. If people were being preventive the way they should be neither virus would be spreading like they are. The media and polititions are doing fearmongering and getting people scared to breath. How would they react if something really bad started?"
"Just to clear myself from seeming like an ignoramus, I made sure to cover my tracks in my OP with the information I provided (by saying to keep checking accredited sources for updates). And when LeBsicuitD responded I also made it clear in my response to that post that the info/stats reported were speculative and the actual number of cases reported were far less than the actual number of cases (a point I was aware of and should have made clear in my original post). The accredited stats/sources provided in the links confirm everything I have said (well, I didn't actually say anything because I'm not an expert and only provided info from ""the experts"") as well as confirmed everything else reported in subsequent posts. The links provided in this thread, while far from being a comprehensive list of all sources, are quite clear in stating that the info they are providing is far from complete and make quite clear that there is much still to be learned and that the data reported thus far is far from infallible if submitted to an acceptable level of scientific rigour. I fail to see what the complaints are with the info/links provided thus far."
"And just to extra clarify, I didn't have a problem with any of the factual data posted by LeBiscuitD. What I took exception to is this:""I have a doctorate in human biology.I would advise all of you to quit trying to do your own stats.""Really? It was rather a nasty way to interrupt this thread and scold me/others. The whole point of my thread was to advise people to stop doing their own stats and to rely on accredited sources of info on the coronavirus. Of all the TA threads that comment could have been posted on it was posted on the singular thread that was encouraging people not to do their own stats. WTF? Has anyone seen any of the numerous threads on TA full of people offering their own advice? Who on this thread is trying to do their own stats? That is completely against everything I'm trying to warn about. Not to beat my own drum but I think thus far mine is the only thread on TA where people are encouraged to stop turning to TA for advice and to inform themselves by looking to accredited scientific sources and also to check government websites to learn about the latest restrictions that might affect your travel. That is all."

"@ French_Mystique I have closely followed this post from the beginning and found some information useful, however your gatekeeping attempt is very territorial. This is a forum established by Tripadvsior, you don't own it, so stipulating what people must say or how they should contribute will have not effect - if you want your own soapbox then go an start your own website. Most data you choose to share only focuses on worst case scenario, by omitting the other side of the argument then you are contributing to the misguidance. Between you, PlannerHaolic and Phread there seems to be a race to see who can have the most post and comments, this is no a game with a leader board nor FB with likes.You don't need to respond to each post, its not always directed to you, why do you take it so personally and react in a defensive manner (what is you hidden agenda).You go on about keeping this post about facts and not expressing opinions - then follow your own advise, your post in 89 goes against everything you say. This is not your Facebook wall.There! somebody had to say it, I know most regulars were thinking it. (im sure you'll get this deleted with the help of your 'mates' - ie multiple accounts)."
"There is no stipulating what people can say on Trip Advisor (as long as it falls within Trip Advisor guidelines) and you obviously have not read what I've said repeatedly on this thread which is that on THIS PARTICULAR THREAD I've ASKED for people to abide to the conditions for posting that I've created ON THIS PARTICULAR THREAD. What is so hard for you to understand about that? You are free to say whatever you want and I have no power to remove any posts (you should really look into how that's done and I'm not going to repeat for you especially what I've already said in regards to that). So you think I'm gatekeeping? In what way can I prevent other people from posting their own thoughts and opinions on Trip Advisor? Have you not noticed the plethora of other threads regarding the coronavirus? Really? Do you really think I have control over what people post here? You have obviously either not read or misunderstood EVERY SINGLE POST I've made on this thread (and many other posts). How do I own Trip Advisor? How could I possibly control what people want to say? How could I possibly remove your comment (which I won't try to do, BTW)? So you don't like my post or any of my comments? Excellent. Now we all know you don't like me or my comments (nor those of phread or plannerhaolic). I would suggest that you spend some time figuring out how Trip Advisor works and fix your broken soapbox, which is so wobbly that it doesn't allow you to stand properly for your intellectual capacity to function properly. I would like to insert a quote by Judge Judy here but I'll spare you the embarrassment.

"China is mentioned in the OP and, as I have been here throughout, I would like to post some statistics. They are taken from the Johns Hopkins site and start from the time that Hubei changed its way of recording cases.13th FebruaryHubei (about 57 million people)48206 cases, 1310 deathsRest of China (about 1.4 billion people)11503 cases, 56 deaths20th FebruaryHubei 62301 cases, 2029 deathsRoC 12545 cases, 89 deaths27th FebruaryHubei 65187 cases, 2615 deathsRoC 12890 cases, 102 deaths5th MarchHubei 67466 cases, 2902 deathsRoC 12943 cases, 110 deaths12th MarchHubei 67781 cases, 3056 deathsRoC 13151 cases, 116 deaths Hubei was where it all started and, by the dates posted above, had been isolated. The medical facilities were overwhelmed. The Rest of China knew that the virus would be coming at the end of the Chinese New Year holiday, and prepared medical facilities and lockdown plans to meet it, starting in late December.I live in the city of Shenzhen in southern China (about 16 million people) and this newspaper article shows the development of the cases:https:/…KTVKAw6HCZjc_2c9nl3UOgShenzhen had cleared People's Hospital Number 3 to meet the demand. It is a thousand bed hospital but never had more than 400 patients. A nurse I know told me that they nearly always had an empty bed between each pair of patients. There was one case in the block opposite my flat. It appeared on the map of case locations as a little red dot next to my little blue dot the next day. The lockdown here was extremely effective in stopping any local spreading. As I had already been in the city for more than two weeks I was not restricted, and got a residents card at the start which allowed me to go in and out subject to wearing a mask and a temperature check. Supermarkets and pharmacies stayed open throughout. Restaurants are mostly open.again."
On the Johns Hopkins site just now it shows more than 3600 cases in France and more than 70 deaths. March 14th (morning). More than double the original post.

"Maybe some good news...If you go to the government website for: National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD, 20894 USA And do a search for: COVID-19 False-positiveYou find an article how testing for the virus produces false positive results as high as 80%.That's great news and perhaps why so many famous people and politicians testing positive are surviving.Here is the article:[Potential false-positive rate among the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' in close contacts of COVID-19 patients].Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the active nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been carrying out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives."

I understand what you are saying the trouble is we can't fly from Seattle to Paris and get home! I saw news where the grocery stores are empty and I imagine the restaurants aren't open .
"Um, grocery stores aren't empty and as of yesterday all non-essential businesses are under a mandatory shut-down order. I'm quite sure you can use google to find out all the official info. Now is not a good time to plan on visiting France, and likely won't be for a minimum of 3-4 weeks. Try googling ""coronavirus france"" and you'll get all the info you need."
"A heads up. Due to the lack of discipline among French citizens today the government MIGHT enforce total confinement starting Tuesday in the Paris region and northeastern France. Nothing is definite yet but it may incur a 6PM curfew as well as distance restrictions, likely of 15-20 kilometers. You heard it here first."

It doesn't stop the spread of the virus, nor does it does make you immune (as a vaccine would). What it does mean though, is less time being sick. Although some have minor symptoms anyway and others have self-cured in a similar time as those being treated. Hopefully it would lower the mortality rate."

">French scientists were the first to identify, isolate, and treat another horrible virus, HIV.<Yes, they were on the forefront, but to be totally correct, it was considered a co-discovery. The virus variants which eventually became know as HIV, were discovered by several groups independently. The discoveries by the French and U.S. scientists were published in the same issue of Science. Another scientist had also isolated a virus with different characteristics. Later it was realized that all were variants of the same virus and renamed HIV."

That will shift as the lockdown continues. Don't underestimate it. Also, it wont be like flipping a giant switch. It'll be internal movement easing first then country by country foreign visitors. My best guess is that travel restrictions on outside visitors to France will begin to ease significantly in June. But that's just a guess.

"""He says COVID-19 may end up being like the seasonal flu.""Without context it's impossible to know what is meant and how to judge that (I have not seen what he actually said).However, if he meant that SARS-CoV-2 may ultimately become endemic in humans and circulate like the flu after the pandemic, then that is a something many experts are suggesting is a possibility.Edited: 1:09 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"Sorry, he wrote it in the New England Journal of Medicine a few days ago."
"I too took Fauci to mean that Covid-19 could become ""seasonal"", that is, it could come back in the northern hemisphere in the autumn/fall if the attempts in the US (and elsewhere - there are other places in the world dealing with this virus) to act against the infection were unsuccessful into the summer. Hence Covid-19 may turn out to have ""flu like"" characteristics, in that it might return, season on season. Not that it was just like any old flu - to which some have immunity and for which vaccines are developed, year on year, to deal with various strains as they mutate around the world. Let's hope we will see a solution to a mutating version of Covid-19 when it turns into Covid-20 and Covid-21.BTW, I'd like a specific reference to the NEJM, and not a context-free ""quote"" - well, really an anecdotal report.

Getting the picture?So saying Covid-19 misses out on being in ths company doesn't rank it with the common cold. Even making the team for some early games says something. Something else that can be said is even that mild complaint, the common cold, was fatal, back in the day of world wide European exploration, to those with no resistance. Probably wasn't on the equivalent of the HCID listing back then. Tell it to the South Pacific.My point? Simplifying the Covid-19 virus misses the point - the numbers don't lie.

"What I personally find dangerous when minimizing the pandemic we have at hand at the moment is promoting or provoking this kind of behaviour : "" A group of young adults held a coronavirus party in Kentucky to defy orders to socially distance. Now one of them has coronavirus "" that I saw on CNN yesterday.And from today on the worldometer site, with the facts and variables we have at the moment, yes there are 172,517 (81%) of Recovered / Discharged in the closed cases. But that also means that up until now it's 39,563 (19%) of deaths.And for me it's quite serious. Those are human lives.And see in the US what it does when someone minimized for too long the seriousness of the pandemic. And in my opinion, what have been said prior to this was only speculation and estimates based on theorical models. What we are living now is a new reality for many of us. Variables from models and reality can widely vary so are the results of those models. They are good for planning but are constantly changing when you are in the deepth of the crisis are it evolves.What I hope that our governement will learn through this is that cutting funds in the Health System is not a good idea. We see what is happening in so many countries. South Korea had learned from past epidemic (SARS) and were a lot more prepared and reacted more efficently.As for Fauci, his hands are so thight up in his back trying to send his message but having to cope with Trump at the same time. So he has to pounder every words he is saying. I would not want to be in his position at the moment. It must be so frustating.That's why it is so important for everyone to follow the directives of staying at home, social distancing and washing are hands and all.Sorry for my long post but it's too serious at the moment. And there are so many missleading informations everywhere that people will believed and that is causing more harm to this already critical situation. We must stand by what most health experts and organizations and most governements are requesting and the info they are providing.Keep safe ! Stay at home :-)"

And they weren't when you posted this, but you refused to listen.""For most healthy people who fall outside these categories it has thus far had the effect more or less of a cold or flu.""— Wrong, many otherwise healthy people who contracted the virus said it was like a near death experience. ""So the moral of the story is (thus far): If you are healthy, and young, and catch the virus you are likely not going to experience symptoms beyond the common cold or flu or you may experience no symptoms at all (if China can be considered as representative of how this virus will manifest itself in other countries).""— And that's why this thread needs to be locked.

You'll have to ask Johns Hopkins about that. We cannot inform you.But just about all of the major countries revise their figures every day for various reasons.
"** I suggest you start with NOT watching CNN. They are unable to report the honest news!!! **The news networks are the reflection of society (left, right and the middle). I don’t see how casting aspersion on any given network will be conducive.Perhaps some circumstantial pieces of evidence led to anecdotes and apocryphal stories against China but no substantiated evidence yet.For instance, in my neighborhood chat room, people are drawn into the fray with eclectic views about this pandemic. Some raise suspicion that COVID-19 initially debouched in Wuhan China; it did not affect Beijing or Shanghai but it reached Europe and the U.S. There is a couple who have Chinese tenants and believe that Chinese dealt with different permutations of the Coronavirus in the past two decades and their experience helped them to stop the spread of the virus to other parts of China and to wrap up Wuhan in 77 days. Others assert that COVID-19 was China’s response to the trade war and some believe we are in the midst of World War III without resorting to any firepower.Despite all views, the truth will eventually prevail, though patience and unbiased intelligence gathering are the fulcrum of the process."

"Yesterday's briefing head of department homeland security science and technology Bill Bryant leading the study of how to kill the virus at their Bio Lab in Frederick Maryland said...Their study shows sunlight's powerful effect on killing the virus both on surfaces and in the air. He illustrates the half life of the virus in different environments, one something like an apartment confinement lockdown where the virus' half life is 18 hours.Compared to direct sunlight in their study shows the half life for the virus is 2 minutes on surfaces and 1.5 minutes in the air. Their study conclusion shows the virus remains alive the longest inside an apartment environment, and inversely the virus quickly dies outside. Currently, France allows me to go outside 1 hour per day to exercise if I am carrying my papers, recently French government wanted that 1 hour outside to be in the evening or early morning.France currently wants my to stay home inside in an environment that keeps the virus alive for 18 hours.Brilliant minds."

I hope that Bill Bryant has some conclusive findings because as summer approaches, breathing will be much harder with the facial mask. A couple of days ago, the temperature reached 27 degrees here and I had trouble breathing with the mask while running errands. I am still taking the new revelations about this virus with a grain of salt, simply because it is too early for the medical community (Epidemiologists, Etiologists, Virologists, etc.) to delineate the behavior of the COVID-19 virus outside of the laboratory environment. Perhaps, this is why we have been receiving contradictory information in the past few months. In the earlier days of this outbreak, some (I believe it was WHO) purportedly posited about facial masks as non-essential unless one is around infected individuals and later the new findings repudiated that claim (in some countries wearing facial masks is compulsory now). Similarly, virus transmission through the thin air was widely denied by the medical experts until new findings proved that the aerosolized and airborne COVID-19 droplets could linger in mid-air long enough to pose danger to people in public places. For the same reason, the immunity to the virus for those who have already treated for COVID-19 and released from the hospital remains undetermined (again despite some false claims). Let us hope the warmer weather (as Bill Bryant suggested) gives us a respite in the coming weeks."
"@kerouac2 loved the punch line! ATF's post is illogical unless he is an individual who acquired immunity by having a very mild or asymptomatic case of Covid19. Viral loading is important and the yes people in the current Nut Job's administration need to examine how light shines through their skulls from ear to ear. I plan to start selling sunlight funnels in orange colors asap to his true believers. Be safe, stay well, dreams of travel help brighten our days."
"ATFRight after the briefing, several news channels interviewed doctors who disagreed that warm weather will make any dramatic changes. Some of them mocked the homeland scientist as being a political pawn, knew nothing about science etcI wish it were true. But I disbelieve most of what comes out during the Orange Cult God’s commercials."
"I don't recall verbatim since I count on the discourse but the guy was kind of clear what his observations were regarding UV light which among other sources comes from the sun. Did he even mention summer or was that a response to journalists.What cleans those masks to make them reusable, UV light? What about a sunbed, better than outdoors..Jack you make the rules sound so palatable, I knew I could count on you, thanks."
"wow talk about not 'getting it'You are asked to stay in your aparement, and not have other people visit, to stop the spread from human to human. If do that a virus living in your apartment for 18 hours is a moot point.I'm not quite sure how people would remove all mucus, blood and lungs from my body but glad to hear it's is simple as just exposing to sun light to stop the spread.."
""" Walking around and basking in the sun can be done all day (for your authorized 60 minutes) if you are not jogging.""""You are asked to stay in your aparement, and not have other people visit, to stop the spread from human to human."""
. The “science” behind the warm weather was immediately contradicted by other doctors and scientists right after the “briefing”I wish it were true but I don’t think so.

"Interesting, boots might be on to something, I was inhaling a disinfectant today and wouldn't that be something if my 3 euro bottle of organic essential turpentine killed this virus.Orange man bad actually asked the homeland science director a question about disinfectants ""is there..."" and Birx and Fauci could have spoken up to clarify what disinfectants could be considered, well Birx anyway, I didn't see Fauci, again."

"No opinion on the sunlight/heat/etc. discussion - although, we had one of our more hot and humid months of March here in Florida (my pool was warm enough to swim for the first time in our 25 years), but we still have plenty of COVID-19 cases here.What concerns me, is any time an ""authority or expert"" talks about ways to kill a virus. Unlike a germ/bacteria/etc., a virus is a non-living entity, there is nothing to ""kill""., I realize, it probably simply an expression, but I always take more stock when people refer to destroying a virus.Edited: 6:51 pm, April 25, 2020 "
Report in Tampa paper of a 26-year old strong healthy police officer who had a near death experience....7 days in a fetal position in bed. I suppose everyone experiences it differently and statistics wouldn’t comfort one who felt reassured And got it anyway.
"What's with the series of post removals? Are they really so dreadful that only one side of the conversation remains - making those still-alive postings unintelligible? Wouldn't it be sensible to take down the whole conversation - how can one side be acceptable to the ""community"" blue penciller, but the other not? Unless the other posts border on libel? Should I keep an eye out to await removal of this innocuous little note?"
Discourse under confinement lockdown. Challenging conversations are normal. I think my post asking how they clean masks for reuse got deleted.At least we still have the internet..
"** What concerns me, is any time an ""authority or expert"" talks about ways to kill a virus. Unlike a germ/bacteria/etc., a virus is a non-living entity **I agree, but once it enters the vernacular, it will be hard to change it. Perhaps, what they mean by killing a virus is to disable its ability to use the replication mechanism in the human cells (the host) to reproduce more viral protein."

"** hrh451, you're welcome. Feel free read to up on the history of UV....**Thank you ATF as always. I will follow up."
"""You might want to grab a dictionary.""Not sure what you mean Hank? you might want to consult some scientific journals. Although there has always been discussion (and probably will continue) about what ""life"" means and what a virus' status may be. The general consensus is that they are in a grey area, that is not quite life or maybe at the the edge of life. A crucial factor being that viruses are not capable of independent replication. Nor do they have a cellular structure (often seen as the basic unit of life), they also do not have their own metabolism or ingest nourishment from their environment.They have been described as nothing but gift-wrapped bits of DNA/RNA or tiny automated, chemical factories. If a virus is alive, then why wouldn't a strand of DNA be considered a form of life? Or for that matter a crystal exhibits many of the same trait of a virus - it grows and recreated/duplicates itself from it materials in the environment where it resides, but most would not consider it alive.A bacterium, on the other hand, is very much alive. It may be just a single cell, but it generates energy and the molecules needs to sustain itself. It also can self-reproduce.Edited: 10:51 pm, April 27, 2020 "
What I mean is that using the word 'kill' to communicate destroying something that is non-living is not an inappropriate use of the word nor does it indicate the person saying it necessarily thinks they are talking about something living.So your concerns about an authority or expert talking about killing a virus has no basis.
"Well, at least the TA posters are in good company; even the microbiologists can't agree if a virus is alive(or not):https:/…are-viruses-alive-what-is-life.html"
"What is the point of amateurs posting as if they are experts? If they were such experts they would be advising the likes of the WHO and their respective governments and not engaging in pathetic one-upmanship on TA. TA is a medium for travel advice, not medical advice from people who are not qualified to give it."
"In complete agreement.So maybe you can help keep TA consistent, at least on the Paris forum, so that only appropriate experts answer questions in their area of expertise.There's a specific thread you can address; it has to do with the appropriate level of physical force(OP used the term ""assault""), if any under French law, a person may use to resist pickpocketing. Many people have given opinions, and there's one poster, apparently from Ireland, who has advocated for the vigorous use of violence in such a situation.Now no doubt you'd agree, such a legal question should be answered only by a French magistrate or judge, or at a minimum a French lawyer, but the Irish poster keeps offering his opinions.To paraphrase your post, ""TA is a medium for travel advice, not [legal] advice from people who are not qualified to give it.As it's clear the poster from Ireland knows nothing about French laws regarding self-defense, please contact that poster and set thing right.For all you hard work on this, from all on TA, a hearty ""Thank You!"""
"I did not give legal advice, I stated how I would act. If I am arrested so be it. I did not give legal advice to anyone, unlike people here behaving as if they are virologists, epidemiologist and medical experts. Let's assume I know nothing about French law...that makes as qualified to lecture people on it as you are to lecture about the virus. There is no apparently about it, I am from Ireland and I am a regular visitor to France, 2-3 times per year."
"Indeed you did, and yes I'm willing to assume you know nothing about French law, specifically self-defense of property or person. Your posts have made that pretty clear.Your advice to OP's question about ""assault"", which is a legal term:""Somebody grabbing you or physically restraining your movement deserves whatever reaction YOU warrant to recover your feeling of safety and security.""But why is this any different from all the other opinions here? What makes you ""qualified"" to tell the OP that in response to his question? Are you an expert in French civil law, specifically in the area of self-defense? Here's a hint: it's very very different from common law self-defense.By the way, your advice in every common law jurisdiction would be wrong, and is most likely wrong in a civil jurisdiction like France, too.But even though you're not a lawyer, you're more than willing to ""lecture"" on the permutations of self-defense under French law.So how is that different than the amateur virologists here?"
"There is a thread specifically asking about ""assault,"" so why has it jumped into posts here ... is there some special connection between the virus and violence?Just one comment on the unrelated issue of ""assault"", it is a criminal offence. Self-defence is something quite different.Anthony K"
"Posts 264, 265 266 should be moved into the ""assault"" thread ... if the authors wish it.Anthony K"
"CMarlowe, what qualifications do you have in French law?"
"None, but you're the one giving legal advice, not me."

"hrh201, as long as the internet holds up I will indeed let you know.Speaking of statistics, India has 1 billion people and 1,000 victims. What is that ratio, 0.00.....1%. And what about Sweden that did not lockdown, how do they compare to similar stats of a country that is doing lockdown, your economy is flipped while Sweden is enjoying a cafe at café..?Maybe Fauci was correct in the Journal."
"Sweden is currently at 22,317 cases and 265 deaths/million. Australia is at 6822 cases and 4 deaths/million. Australia closed borders and semi locked down."
Sweden has not at all reached its peak yet. Just so long as they are having fun....!
"For an even more fine grained comparison, the population of Sweden is 10M and of Australia 25M - round figures. Interesting arithmetic."
"Without checking the figures, I thought that the whole point of per capita figures was to be able to compare places of different sizes."
"Australia's numbers are amazing. Here's the whole chart, nation by nation:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"

"Do the following two paragraphs fit with what you are reading or are they not up to date?""From 11 May, the lockdown measures previously in place on French territory will gradually be lifted. However, this does not change anything : travel between France and the UK is permitted only when strictly necessary.

"Masks are rapidly disappearing from the streets of Paris. I would say that in the last week, usage has gone from about 50% to 10% (still obligatory on public transportation). Here is the scene yesterday evening (around 20:30) along the Bassin de la Villette in the 19th arrondissement.https:/…O4eLqt.jpghttps:/…aBOadp.jpgThere is no enforcement of the alcohol ban (or the cannabis ban, for that matter), since it exists only to provide a legal framework in case there is some sort of incident."
"Superb soirée last evening with plenty of social distancing. However... 20 plus years on living here and under a purported pandemic in the people's mindset the French still don't know the phrase double-dipping, oh well, I guess Rambouillet is the next hot zone.The new highly educated trained in the field medical human trackers hunting for covids they probably should add to their strategy to look in the victims' fridge for double dipping evidence.Going to have another 10 person party tomorrow and do a double blind test on my new dip sauce to see if sharing salsa saliva was a fluke.."
@ATF: Glad you are okay and enjoying yourself. Play the Jerry Seinfeld’s episode on double-dipping before serving the sauce and you might stem double dipping for the night :-)
"You're worried about double dipping? I am still appalled at the number of Americans who tear off a piece of baguette at the restaurant and throw the other piece back in the basket.I'm not at all worried about this for sanitary purposes, but I don't think anybody wants to find a partially used piece of bread in the basket. If you don't want to eat the whole thing, you just leave the rest in your plate or next to your plate."
Like Australia we have closed borders and a lockdown. Australia has 4 deaths per million and NZ 4.3.We are at 97% recovered and we are down to 27 live cases. Restrictions being lifted but borders closed. Returning Kiwi have 14 days supervised isolation. Trans Tasman bubble coming up.I suspect that lower density living may be helpful.
"HR Puff n' Stuff, we did fois gras on toast last night so no chance of double dipping..)However... it had been months of a lockdown so a few french kisses went around. I guess we are all doomed.
