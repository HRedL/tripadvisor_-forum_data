"The Government has decided on the following on 10 July 2020: As of 13 July 2020, internal border control will be lifted from travel between Finland and the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Greece, Liechtenstein, Malta, Germany, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Hungary. Travel between Finland and these countries would thus be possible without restrictions from the perspective of border control at all Finnish airports and in all seaports, provided that the traffic location is open to such traffic. https:/â€¦guidelines_for_border_traffic"
