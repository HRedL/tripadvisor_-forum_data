"Hi, Staying at the Melia hotel in Murcia town centre and can anyone tell me the nearest beach to Murcia town and if there are public buses to get there. Also is there a bus from the airport to Murcia town?Thanks"
"Due to the health emergency caused by the Covid-19, the bus lines of the Murcia International Airport have been suspended until further notice."
"The nearest beach resorts are Torrevieja, San Pedro del Pinitar, Los Alcazares or La Manga del Mar Menor. None of them are easy by public transport from Murcia city,"
"Although there are direct buses (operated by Globalia) to Los Alcazares, San Pedro del Pinatar and Torrevieja, in that stopping order outward, on the Murcia to Alicante route."
