"hei,it is not favourable to travel leh in coming some of months because of the qurantine restrictions,tense situation in pangong between indo-china troops and moreover their are coming several cases of covid19 in leh as perlatest news. my tickets are also was in the month of july of spicejet but after too much requests they offer me onetime datechange waiverand i have booked tickets for the month of april by paying few bucks on fare difference so it is better that you should must try to change your flight tickets by requesting airline again and again."
"Hi,I have my tickets booked with Spice jet as well and my trip is scheduled in first week of October 2020.Can you please suggest how did you manage the airlines for tickets/reschedule/waiver.Do we have to email them or by phone.Thanks in advance"
